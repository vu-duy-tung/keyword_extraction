We were a party of six; Two people's dinners were inedible, and the other four were incredibly displeased with their food.  The main course took forever, to get to us, and when it finally arrived all of the food was inconsistently cooked or inedible (ie. pink/bloody pork, prime rib that was 95% fat).  I do not think I will be returning to eat at T Cooks after this experience.",

Restaurant of this class should have more consistent service. This is why from me it's remain only 3 stars",

Had to ask hostess (when she appeared from kitchen for service). Helped ourselves to our purchased water bottle put on service tray several tables away. Weird it wasn't left on the table like the first bottle. Had Caesar salad w flat iron steak. Very very little amount of salad (I'm not a big eater and not impressed with quantity). It wasn't flat iron. Seemed like bad tough cut of sirloin. After sawing away with steak knife decided to give up on it. Wasn't asked why it was basically untouched. We'll try it again during the season and hope for the great experiences we have had in the past. Love the patio ambiance when our weather is nice.",

UGH They truly should include a $250 Gift Card with every meal to ensure patrons return back! OK, a pre-fix is acceptable but you need to add \"tasting menu\" if you are going to present (3) scallops for a entree! A 2\" by 2\" size portion of steak tare tare that tasted like warm hamburger pureed and (3) thimble sized oysters for your Rockefeller App. The Pre-Fix should have been priced at $45 TOTAL for the portions you presented. The sad thing is, we love your restaurant and have had the pleasure of dinning with you before and might again but for most, this was a 1st and LAST time experience. How do you sleep at night ripping people off this way when it might be the only meal they splurge on all year. Seriously, shame on you!",

The latter was the chef's special and the tasty dish had nice presentation and a generous serving of duck. My order of the cod was ok; the white asparagus was too a la dente for my liking but the fish was cooked perfectly. We enjoyed a moderately priced bottle of red.  Service was excellent.   THEN we went to the lounge and swung to 3 sets of sassy jazz with Renee Patrick. Lounge is always great people watching and folks may have mused as we slowly, totally unwound to the music and jive.   Thank you T Cooks for a musical evening, that is a routine offering with their weekend dining. Thank you Ms Patrick for the enormous set of lungs.",

    "text": "This review is for their most recent Mother's Day Brunch.  We arrived to the Royal Palms resort and were immediately greeted by the valet - I had assumed it would be a challenge to deal with parking but we pulled right up and were immediately escorted to the hostess stand.  We were the first in our party to arrive so they showed me to the table while my wife waited for everyone else.  When I got to the table they'd set up some umbrellas to provide shade; however the sun had moved so the table wasn't completely in the shade - they took the initiative to move the umbrellas.  They even brought another umbrella over to increase the shade.  With this I could tell that they were prepared to provide the best possible experience.  The rest of our crew finally showed up, the server took our drink order and we were released to hit the buffet.  Here's where things got interesting - you know how when you go to a buffet there are your obligatory items and much of the food is cold or underwhelming?  Well, NONE of that was present.  Sure, there were items one would expect (prime rib, leg of lamb, a mountain of bacon, etc.) but the majority of the offerings were truly unique.  The prime rib was fabulous!  I could write an entire tome on how perfect it was, but alas, I'll move on.  The omelet station was packed full of options and your omelet was cooked to order.  They had some potato-gratin that were a little too good - my wife kept swiping bites off my plate.  After I'd taken advantage of their mountain of proteins, I figured I'd be a bit responsible and hit their cold-salad table.  That's where I'd discovered my mistake - there were about 20 different options, and each of them were fantastic.  The chorizo shrimp & mussels were so good I went back, twice, for them.  Anyway, I could keep writing about how awesome the food was, but my main point is that there wasn't a single item in this massive buffet that wasn't top-notch.  I'm pretty sure that my family is going to consider T.Cooks our go-to spot for brunch now on!  Thank you to everyone that worked on Mother's Day - you made our experience memorable.  For that, there are no adequate words of appreciation.",

We finally sat outside under the heater in the beautiful patio garden. We ordered the charcuterie - wonderful, great selections of meats & cheeses!  They have a new chef, so the menu has changed. I had the salmon, it was ok, my husband had the sea scallops, very good and our friend ordered the antelope, ( not what I would have picked), he said it was  average . Our server was Daniel , who I thought did a fine job!  Overall it wasn't quite fine dinning, but working its way back up there. Beautiful patio!",

The ambiance was beautiful, quiet, classy. The staff was great, especially our waiter Chris. He REALLY knew his wines and was able to answer all of our questions on the menu. He timed dinner perfectly so we were never waiting but also didn't feel rushed.    And the food... So so good. We ordered the Octopus/Calamari. It was delicious, but didn't necessarily stand out compared to other reputable steakhouses. For the main course we both got the Grilled Prime Strip. It was 12 oz of perfectly flavored, juicy steak. Probably the best steak I have had in the past 10 years. Believe it or not the best part of the meal was the accompaniments- lived the combination of shishito peppers and heirloom tomatoes was perfect. After dinner we took a romantic stroll through the grounds which were beautiful and perfect for a romantic date night.",

    "text": "What an average dinner.  T Cooks is in a beautiful hotel and has a great atmosphere. Not much else to offer.   As a disclaimer, I had fairly high expectations considering the caliber of restaurant.   The salads were mediocre at best. For the meal, I had the filet which had to be one of the worst filets I've ever had. My coworkers had the bison ribeye, and said it was good, probably would recommend that if you do go to the restaurant. One bright spot - the marscapone mashed potatoes, some of the best mashed potatoes I have ever had.  The dessert was seriously lacking. I had a layer cake with peanut butter in it, I seriously thought that it came out of a Hostess box (no offense to Twinkies), it was the most bland and uninspiring dessert I have had in a long time. One coworker had a banana dessert that looked great, but no guarantees....  Lastly, they just redid their wine list, eliminating many of the upper end wines. Not that I'm a frequenter of the Reserve List, but if you're going for a special occasion or on a business dinner, you'll be out of luck.   If you are staying at the Royal Palms, it is convenient. But I wouldn't venture more than a mile to eat here.",

Cook's : )  As it was just the three of us this year we decided to go out for Christmas Dinner and we had a truly wonderful meal in a very pretty setting.  For appetizers we had the lobster bisque with asparagus and caviar and the wild burgundy escargot with crisp brioche, lightly scrambled eggs, mushrooms and roasted garlic mascarpone cheese....both were delicious.  For mains we tried the slow roasted lamb stuffed with feta, tomatoes and oregano on a bed of marinated tomatoes, roasted green peppers and fingerling potatoes as well as the glazed ham with Italian fennel sausage dressing, haricot vert, sweet potato gratin and cranberry relish....tastebud sensations!  Once again we sat on the patio which was just perfect with Christmas day temps in the 70s. We had our beautiful newborn with us and when she got slightly fussy we were able to calm her down by walking through the gorgeous gardens and courtyards. She just loved all of the beautiful colors and smells : )  The staff were also wonderfully friendly and helpful. Highly recommend T. Cook's for any meal or event.",

I feel that the rich fabrics, large upholstered seating, warm lighting & tile work are all in line with the classic, old-timey mediterranean / Spanish vibe.  Starters: The sweet corn bisque with huitlacoche is off the charts delicious.  It is a must-have. I can't wait to go back, and have it again. I found the lobster angliotti to be a bit underwhelming. I thought the the combination of a very soft stuffing to the soft and slippery pasta wonton to be unpleasant, while the lobster was chewy. Still, the flavors were interesting.   Sides: Risotto with brocolli rabe was nothing to write home about. The presentation was poor, and the texture & flavors unenjoyable.   Main Course: My husband had the antelope cooked medium rare. It was a first for both of us. We absolutely loved it! The flavor & texture were so fantastic! They did a beautiful job with the sides, and cooking the meat to the perfect temperature.  My dish on the other hand, the black grouper was a huge disappointment. I don't see how this ever made it's way to the menu. It was over cooked & tough on the outside, but the inside was raw. It was sitting in a fishy bean soup. The beans were undercooked, and the flavor was not the good flavor of the ocean, but simply terribly fishy.  Dessert: Chocolate Pate and Peanut Butter Chocolate Bar. I'm just going to say, WOWZERS!",

My boyfriend and I somewhat arrived on accident one night, only to realize that I have been missing the best happy hour ever! We have been back many times since, and I try to recommend it to all my girlfriends.   Its part of the Palm Hotel, so obviously its beautiful, elegant, comfortable and more.  They have a lovely inside bar and live music sometimes too.  But my favorite spot to sit is the beautiful outside patio, especially now, as the weather here is amazing.   So they have super fancy smancy cocktail list, which is all 50% off  during happy hour.  They also have awesome discounted appetizers. We had the pretzel bites with cheese and grilled brie.  But the best night to go is Monday night for Mustache Monday.  They have even more discounted cocktails with names like \"The Ron Burgundy and Fu-Manchu\".  Also - fake mustaches. So fun!  Connie is awesome, she is super cute and has been our server a few times now. Always spot on with recommendations and even comped us a few drinks when the service was slow.

    "text": "Met some friends for brunch at T. Cooks - it was a really nice place.  I am really glad I read the other Yelpers' suggestions before I went.  It is a must to order an entree and get the buffet as an add-on.  That is a no-brainer.  I'm not sure who came up with their pricing for the brunch/entrees, but it was a bit strange - same price to order an entree with the buffet as ordering just the buffet.  Huh.  Anyhow, the banana stuffed french toast was pretty good - a little dry, but good.  One of my other friends ordered the apple and brie french toast - it looked drenched in sauce, but she said it was good.  My other friend ordered the salmon - he liked it, but didn't care for the skin left on the salmon.  The buffet was good if you plan to eat a ton of crab legs and shrimp.  The salads are good, but the selection is very small.  The omelet guy makes a really good omelet.  Other than that, the buffet is somewhat unimpressive.  I should have passed on the buffet.  I mostly enjoy buffets for their delicious desserts, and this dessert spread was completely uninspired.  The creme brulee was not cooked all the way and the cannoli was just okay.   The other desserts were just okay, too - nothing to remember.  So... my suggestion is to just order an entree and skip the buffet, unless you are famished and want to stuff yourself - then, go for it!  It was pricey, so be prepared for the bill! I probably won't go back for awhile to eat.  However, I did stop in the reception for the hotel after brunch and asked to see a casita. They were very accommodating and had a bellman show us a casita room fairly quickly.  The room was nice, but the view was really nice!  The pool areas are very well maintained.  This would be a nice place to come for a romantic weekend get-away.",

We had to wait a bit in the bar before our reservation was ready but the bar is quaint with live music.  The surroundings and restaurant are gorgeous.  I wish we would have sat outside, but inside is nice.  Our group started with a sampler of appetizers.  We shared the antipasto platter with locally made cheeses, and in house cured meats and pickled vegetables.  The restaurant is making a very good farm to table effort.  We also had crab cakes and the super amazing carbonara for an appetizer.  Needless to say we were stuffed before the food even came.  I had the bisque which was good not as great as I expected given the reviews.  Everyone was very pleased with the food.  The only dessert we had was a complimentary birthday carmel cheesecake creme brulee.  AMAZING, I watched my husband devour it and he doesn't like cheese.  I was shocked and a bit jealous that I only had one bite, but it was his birthday.  I would go back just to get another shot at the desert menu.   Service by Bill excellent, he never had to ask what we needed it just appeared.",

My Husband had the quail for the first course which he said was ok, but our entrees were really great.  My lobster was fantastic! The pea shoot ravioli's were amazing.  My husband had the filet which he was very happy with.  For desert we had the peanut butter banana brioche with bacon and the creme brulee cheesecake. The peanut butter brioche was out of this world. The only downside was the back waiter who was a little overzealous to clear the dishes....but all in all it was a wonderful meal in a beautiful setting.  I think it is a little overpriced but still a great dining experience.",

    "text": "The food was mostly great.  The calamari appetizer can definetly be passed up: one lump of fried calamari in the middle of a bowl of chopped tomatoes...lame.  The seafood was all good (good scallops, halibut great but kind of small portion) but one of the steaks was done med rare instead of med well and the other was a little over.  Which leads me to the only reason I couldn't give 5 stars: service.  I would like a waiter that speaks and understands english very clearly.  He obviously misheard on the steaks or gave the wrong one to the wrong person and he wasn't sure about some of the seafood questions.  Also, when charging prices like these, I expect pretty good service with attention to detail like making sure silverware is reset before our dinners are in front of us (hello what am I supposed to eat with??).  We should've gotten bread service right away but had to ask after a few rounds of drinks.  Btw, the pesto is some of the best I've ever had!!    This is a great place for pricey special occasions.  Food was excellent and nice atmosphere.  Service could be a little more refined though (think servers at Elements).  Compliments to the chef!",

We chose it because Fodor's travel book on Arizona recommended it for it's dramatic views of the Camelback Mountain, romantic atmosphere and delicious food. It was romantic and the food was delicious but this Georgia girl was very disappointed in the view- or lack there of. We were seated outside in the back. Our view was of an outdoor fireplace and a brick wall enclosing the space. But I suppose what the view lacked, the food made up for. The butternut squash soup was creamy with just the right amount of spice. I tried antelope for the first time. It was delicious, tender and flavorful. A bit pricey but worth it! They also had a nice wine selection. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and prompt. An expensive dinner but worth it for a special occasion.",

I agree with David G, with such accolades about this restaurant, I expected to be blown away with food and service. Instead, it was just ok.

Started with Mussels, Pear and Gorgonzola salad and pate. The Mussels and Salad were excellent. The pate was a little disappointing. Chewy and not very tasty. It was country style.    Our entrees were all excellent. Salmon, Short ribs and steak.  The Salmon had this awesome crispy skin, delicious blue cheese potatoes. Steak was excellent. Short ribs had a cumin citrus sauce that was so good. The meat was falling off the bones. It was served over risotto that was a tad salty but very good.  We got three desserts. The warm chocolate cake was a little standard but the raspberry mint sorbet was a True winner and I don't even love sorbet.  Creme brulee cheesecake was heavenly.  Service was great. We highly recommend sitting out on the patio. It's like a little oasis.",

    "text": "So this was my first stop on my trip to Phoenix.  After muchos yelpers recommendations and reading some of the decent reviews I decided to bring my group to this place.  The Royal Palms is a gorgeous resort and the building and restaurant are very beautiful.  I called the day of to get a reservation for 6 and to my delight there was no prob getting  one.  Some of the people in my party were not used to such fine dining, but since they were with a professional I told them not to worry.  Plus the menu really didn't scream out anything to crazy.  We were seated in the center of the dining room under neath this giant metal sculpture.  It took about 10 minutes for our waiter to finally approach us , but after that he was attentive and pleasant for most the meal.  I was really excited to enlighten some of the people I was with about dining like this.  Although I did not believe the food to be up to what some people on here have claimed.  I found the food to be very bland, uninspired, and boring.  I felt bad because I felt I was cheating the people I was with out of a great first fine dining experience.  This place was seriously nothing special.  The service really saved a bad meal.  Now the desserts.  I had heard of the pastry chef before and was excited to see what he had to offer.  We ordered every dessert on his menu besides the cheese tasting.  I don't know about y'all but I am sick of seeing creme brulee on menus!!!  When I saw that he had CB on the menu I was already disappointed.  Creme Brulee is such a cop out!  I will say that the dessert plate ups were nice.  He did a lot of sugar work and interesting tuille cookie shapes.  Overall I wish I could give this place a 2.5 for their service only.  Way overrated according to the reviewers and a little out dated.....",

Not sure why you would cut a piece of meat like that. It also had no seasoning on the meat at all.  The menu said that it came with potatoes, I found 1. The pepper sauce that there was just a hint of was ok, but there needed to be more. The vegetables looked like they died under a salamander. At 40$ I expected a little more.

They offered one along with their normal menu. It says a lot because I think most foodies will know, pre set menus usually aren't great.   Everything we had here was amazing. The bottle of Cristal wasn't overpriced. Very fair for a high end restaurant at $350 for the bottle. We ordered the Spanish Octopus. The best I've ever had. I recommend this dish to anyone who wouldn't even try octopus.  Also had the Filet and Flat Iron Steak. Both dishes were cooked perfectly.

    "text": "Don't go there for lunch. Love T. Cook's for dinner, but three of us went for lunch and were very disappointed. First of all, it was not busy and it took our waiter at least 15 minutes to get our drink order. We were waiting patiently for our bread/pesto (that we saw on everyone's tables) to have with our drinks, but it never came. The waiter disappeared for most of our meal and when he finally checked on us somewhere near the end of the meal we were able to ask where our bread was and he said \"it's in the oven.\"  We basically got it after we were done eating.  I ordered a Cobb salad and mentioned to the waiter that the menu does not indicate avocado, which I said is a main ingredient in a Cobb salad. He said, \"don't worry, there's avocado on it.\" When he brought it out, no avocado. When I commented, he said \"oh, did you want avocado\"?? As I was eating my salad, the dark specs that I thought were bacon bits were really sliced olives (not in a Cobb salad nor mentioned on the menu). I dug around for the bleu cheese, none of that either. I kept waiting to say something to him, and we finally snagged a waitress as she walked by, who graciously brought me the bacon and bleu cheese. She actually helped us several times throughout our meal while our waiter was MIA. Kathy ordered the Reuben sandwich which she said was very good, however, the Parmesan french fries were not crisp, and, believe it or not, had no Parmesan! The third entree was the Bronzino which Patty said was good, but the potatoes were plain with no flavor. We all agreed that the bread and pesto that we finally got, and couldn't really eat because we were full, was the best part of the meal!  It took forever to get the bill, and once the credit card was ready to be processed, no waiter, again. We waited for about 10 minutes, then grabbed another waitress and asked her to please take care of it - she delivered it to him wherever he was.   I had asked the waiter for the House or cheapest glass of red wine. He asked me what kind I wanted and I teased that I wanted the least expensive. He said they're all the same price and gave me choices I opted for the Pinot Noir. When we got the bill, it was $12 and I had noted there were other reds for $10 on the menu.   Now, I know the mistakes on the food were from the kitchen, but the combination of the missing waiter, issues with the food and overcharge on the wine, along with mentioning all of this to the manager who basically just said sorry, has left a bad taste in our mouths.   On top of all that, when I arrived I was going to self-park under the building but a guy stopped me for \"complementary valet\". I went to tip him $2 when I left and instead of two $1 bills, I gave him a $5 and a $1- $6! Not too complementary and a big tip from someone who lives on Social Security",

The food was lacking, however.  A medium rare filet came out verging on well done.  The recook was rare.  A restaurant of this supposed caliber should have no problem with something as elementary as cooking a steak to the proper temperature.  Outback \"Steakhouse\" can do this.     Regardless of the issues with temperature, the food was fairly lackluster.  The charcuterie slate was nothing more than grocery store level prosciutto and the food was generally underseasoned.   For a $200 dinner, the meal should have been exceptional.  It wasn't even close.",

    "text": "We went to T. Cook's last night for a birthday dinner.  I had been there a year ago for a meal and really enjoyed the experience.  We started in the bar, which is cozy and has some excellent cocktails.  My one complaint, is they had live music and the place is way too small to have a conversation while the music is playing (even thought the musician was quite good). And this is the kind of place where you want to hang and in quiet, comfortable elegance have a conversation.  The food this year was also a bit of a disappointment.  The appetizers were small and uninteresting. We tried the shrimp saltimboca and the grilled octupus. For $14 each, they were extremely small servings.  Secondly, the flavors were not interesting at all. The shrimp tomato sauce was bland, and one of my party members ate all of the prosciutto in one small bite.  The grilled octupus tasted good, but there was so very little of it. We had to cut up the two tentacles (buried on a plate of dressed lettuce) into 3 small pieces each to be able to share it with the others.  The entrees were previously inventive and with a mediterranean focus.  This visit, half the menu offers meat entrees with sides being extra and optional. If looking for the previous creative plates, the options were fewer. That said, one of my dinner partners ordered the lamb chops with cous cous and feta which was  delicious and another a bass plate which was lovely. The latter, however, was quite small.  My two dinner partners opted for dessert. One was a very flavorable bread pudding, the other ordered a rather bland honey cake. To the waiter's credit, he took the cake offf the menu after my friend offered his displeasure with it.  Overall, the ambience is very nice.  The service was excellent. The food can be good but is hit and miss.  I will give it another try in the future, but I hope they can work on some of the menu options.",

Confirmed the reservation 2 days in advance for a PRIVATE room. You would think everything was in place.  WRONG.   Ended up waiting over 35 minutes past our reserves time because the host/manager(?) gave away OUR ROOM! Then they gave us a table in the loud BAR after they had promised to make it right! Unfortunately, with a party of this size AND holiday circumstances we were stuck with this \"restaurant\". The \"host/manager\" even remarked that seeing as we likely don't have any other option he didn't expect us to leave. We couldn't believe it.   Supremely disappointed and embarrassed because I actually recommended this place and they ended up giving us a SUB-PAR experience on a very special occasion. Not to mention that everyone in our party traveled from out of state.",

I had the huevos rancheros which was one of the worst I've ever had. My husband had the burger which was marginal. It took us two hours to get out of their. Their credit processing was not working so we had to either have them write down our credit card number or pool our cash. It all was completely incongruent with the T Cook's of years ago.",

Never mind the fact that they screwed up our reservation and told us we were just \"SOL\" and the next best thing was sitting in the bar and next to the restroom (a far cry from the private room we reserved and confirmed). Never mind that the \"manager,\" Christian, was completely condescending and misleading. (Pro tip: If you're willing to risk it and eat here, do not let him make your reservation.)  Never mind the 45 minute wait when we were early for our reserved time and this restaurant's version of \"making things right\" (their exact words) was to offer champagne to a party of non-champagne drinkers, including 3 underage people. (Did I mention they sat these same underage people, including a 7 year old in the bar?)   What really got us was the cold, so-so food after all of the issues we'd already experienced. The wait staff was equally so-so, which was disappointing since they included 20% gratuity for a large party. They offered incredibly weak compensation, but of course this was a wash. Guess we really were SOL. Save yourself the trouble and try any of the truly great restaurants in the area.",

    "text": "We used a Travelzoo deal for Sunday brunch here, which was $79 for 2 people and included a mimosa for both of us. The normal price would've been $110.  Then we paid tax of around $10 and then tipped our waiter who was excellent 20% of the $110.  I had heard a couple good reviews of this place and I think I built it up too much in my mind. It was good, but not excellent. It isn't something I would come back to and that's mainly because I like trying new places and because I felt like it was overpriced. The Travelzoo deal made that better, but I know we didn't eat that much food.  There wasn't that big of a spread and the line was long. The grounds were beautiful though and the place is very nice. Valet parking only, which was fine and quick. The omelette was good and I like that it was small so that I could still sample other stuff. They made crepes and mini pancakes and Belgian waffles and had bacon and sausages and potatoes then a small salad bar and some pastries and fruit. The pastries weren't super soft, which was a disappointment and the fruit and seafood were ok.  I am glad we tried it, but there setup needs to be better to allow a faster flow of traffic-maybe access to both sides of the buffet instead on one line.",

We were greeted warmly at the front. Our reserved table was perfectly situated viewing the patio and mountain. Tanino was THE best server ever, anticipating our every question and need before we even needed to ask. His recommendations on the menu were spot on. The food was incredible and very well portioned. Go hungry and leave room for dessert. Starting with the foccacia and pesto... the best pesto-OMG, amazing hummus platter (took home left overs and ate it all the next day!), lamb (my boyfriend LOVED), beluga lentil soup and Brussels sprouts I will dream of for days to come. The wine selection was lovely! Thank you Dom. Very high quality, nice cozy ambiance, everyone in the restaurant was friendly and welcoming. We will definitely come back again! Thank you Tanino!

    "text": "Oh T Cook's,  Let me count the ways - You made my dining experience amazing and then some.  I had made reservations for five people to celebrate a birthday.  Parking was valet so make sure you bring cash to tip. When I got there, my party was already seated and once you get into the gates of the Royal Palms, you almost feel like you are no where near Phoenix.  It is such a beautiful resort.  The ambiance is beautiful with traditional contemporary decor. Of course we took advantage of restaurant week specials and we all got to pick a three course dinner.    First course - venison tartare with sea salt crackers.  I've never had tartare before so I decided to try it.  It had a real unique taste to it.  The texture was wet and sticky and I was only able to eat a few bites.  After that, it left this weird taste in my mouth so lucky for me, on to the second course.  Second course - beef tenderloin cooked medium well.  The beef was flavorful, tender, and fantastic. I've never realized how much I loved beef until that moment when I sunk my teeth into the first slice. I ate every single slice, crumb, and juice that was on that plate. I was full, but not full to not eat my third course - the dessert.  Third course - chocolate peanut butter bar.  It was amazing!  The crunch, the chocolate, the peanut butter, the vanilla ice cream....wow.  I wanted more!  I really did and I realized I had to compose myself.    The bill came and yikes, it was not a cheap dinner by any means (three course, wine, coffee, and tip = Avg $65/person).  I am definitely sure I wouldn't come back if it wasn't restaurant week.  After dinner, we took a walk around the courtyard and it was beautiful.  Not only was my party impressed, but my stomach was too.",

You feel like you're pulling into old Hollywood. And they treat you like that. Would highly recommend. The dining room is beautiful. We sat outside on the patio, but took a quick tour through the restaurant since it's been updated.  It is warm, sexy, and special.

There was a wonderful female singer singing in the bar area all night and the whole atmosphere at the bar and surrounding areas was magical.  When we were called for our reservation, we had decided previously to sit outside on the back patio with the heaters.  It was such a beautiful night and the ambiance outside was just perfect.  We could hear the female singer throughout our meal, at the perfect level of volume where she sang old hits of Carly Simon, Tracey Chapman and a perfectly edited song selection list.  We were a party of 6 and so we started with some appetizers.  Chris was our waiter and he was beyond fantastic.  He was so knowledgeable about all the different things and ingredients in each meal.  We had fussy foodies in our group, so it wasn't an easy sell.  We started with the Spanish Octopus which was beyond amazing.  The mussels, which were also very good.  We had to ask for the bread which they no longer serve and you must ask for it.  It was also great and went so well with using up the fantastic broth that came with the mussels.  The tomato-fennel risotto was very creamy and had a beautiful sweet taste of broccoli rabe.  My favorite though was the Sea Bass Crudo, can I say Oh My Gosh!  The grapefruit accompaniment went so well with the other tastes that were with the dish, it was amazing.  I shared with my husband a bowl of the roasted butternut squash soup and 1/2 of the organic greens salad.  The presentation of the roasted butternut squash soup was beautiful.  A bowl of little pear, candied pecans and an elixir to which the soup is poured over at the table, so pretty.  For our main course, we all had different things and gave each other tastes from which to savor.  I had the parsnip agnolotti which was pieces of Maine lobster in an orange brown butter with ravioli's stuffed with parsnips.  Simply delicious and more than one would expect to receive from a fine restaurant.  I couldn't even finish it as it was rich.  My husband had the whole roasted Loup de Mer, which was a whole fish, with tomatoes on top and olives and peppers in a lemon sauce.  It was unbelievable.  The man to the left of me, had the antelope.  It came on a presented on a slice of a tree log plate, so fitting being that it was antelope.  Being I don't eat meat, I didn't taste it, but others at the table did and were very impressed.  We had four in our party that were celebrating March birthdays, so we were brought out a selection of sweets from the chef.  They were magnificent from a berry laden pound cake to truffles, to ice cream, etc.  All were very fancy and decorated beyond your imagination.  We accompanied them with cappuccinos.  What a perfect place to go and dine with people who are close to you.  Do yourself a favor and check this restaurant out, you won't be disappointed, we sure weren't.",

Even with a full dining room, we could hear each other.  My glass was always full and I never had to ask for anything.  My husband even mentioned his like of heirloom tomatoes on his crab and the server came back with a small dish for him to enjoy even more.

I luv visiting as many of the resorts here in Scottsdale & Phoenix as much as possible, as all of them have so much to offer to delight all the senses.  From the second you drive up to the lush & palatial grounds, you know you've come to the right place.  Any stress or worries disappear immediately.  I felt transported 9000 miles away in Europe.  Make sure you slowly walk around and literally smell the flowers.  The attention to detail is everywhere, including candles lit on the stairs - Awwwwwww !  The lounge is L-shaped, so it's perfect to find a quiet nook for 2, or join in & meet new people at the welcoming bar, or a sofa.  The martinis were shaken and poured in the most excellent manner - and man, am i seriously picky about ingredients, the mix, the shaking,  presentation, and the pour (please have little ice floating, please be ICE cold, frozen tini glass earns extra points!).    Since we had eaten a very late lunch, we seriously wanted to try the nosh items, but only had room for the utterly amazing Chick Peas - I think they were flash fried?  But the were so addicting!  WOW.  Since they were offering a really good special on a 2000 bottle of Perrier Jouet of Champangne, that topped off the night, while flute in hand, we strolled the gorgeous grounds,  OK, seriously?  I am going back before the end of the week.  (And strongly hinting we should go all out & book next month before their summer specials end.....)",

Seriously, the menu nomenclature people need to re-think that one...When I think of red chicken, I think of salmonella, but that's not what they mean:)   I know, I know... they mean the chicken is red with pecan wood smoke, and it is and it's a terrific dish, but still...the name:)  I had braised short ribs...perfectly done with a marvelous horseradish infused risotto cake:)...Inspired:)  They also have some very pleasant and tasty sides:)  We had brussel sprouts (that were nearly as good as the sprouts I make at home:)...and potato puree...and seared Foie Gras...decadent and wonderful:)  I tried to get Carin to have the foie gras with me, but we differ in our opinions about foie gras, and so, I had to take the bullet and eat it all myself:)...That should make my cardiologist buddies happy:)  Time really can stand still when you're having an evening like this...by the time we finished our shared Chocolate Napoleon and coffee, it was 10:30 and way past our bed time:)  But such a pleasant evening...never any rush from the servers, never a wait for the next course...everything perfectly timed, completely unobtrusive (no, our conversation was never interrupted to inquire \"do you love everything?\":)  It was worth staying up late for an evening as pleasant as this...and almost worth waiting three years for, too!  But we won't wait three more years to swing by T Cook's again...they are just too good and right in the hood:)",

    "text": "I really don't know what I could say to really give this place the review it deserves!   T. Cooks was OUTSTANDING and above my expectations!!!!   Hubs and I went here this past Monday for our 2 year wedding anniversary! We had never been and I had been wanting to try it out.   We were shown to our table and they had rose petals scattered around, nice touch.   Our waiter Dan was great. Full of knowledge about the wine selection and very personable.   We started with crab cakes, I don't really eat crab, But I finished it off, so good! I loved the crispness of the out side of the cake and the sweet corn sauce it was placed upon.   Next up was soup. Hubs got the lobster bisque and I got the nights special which was a cauliflower puree and cheese soup. AMAZING! I love that they bring the bowl out empty (well there is fun little accompaniments in there) and then pour the soup right there, very fancy.   Out came the entrees. Hubs had the prime rib and I had the Dover sole. The fish was cooked perfectly. We ate until we were in a food coma.   But that's not all, as it turns out a friend of ours waiters there, he wasn't working that night but called and told them it was our anniversary, hence the flowers on our table, as we did not tell them when we made reservations. They brought out a dessert platter on the house! It had about four different desserts on it and all were decadent!   We really had a great time here and cant wait to go back!",

    "text": "Before you freak out at the 2 star rating, let me explain myself.  My scale usually goes like this - 3 stars is average (duh), a place I wouldn't necessarily put effort into going to but I wouldn't be totally disappointed if somehow I wound up there.  2 stars would be somewhere I likely wouldn't return and wouldn't recommend to others.  For what T Cooks is trying to be, it is not worth a return trip for me.  Not that the food, decor, service, or anything was that terrible, but for the price there are far better fine dining establishments.  There is absolutely no reason to choose T Cooks or allow others to choose it.    Ok - so this review is based solely on my experience at the wine bar/lounge area and not the actual restaurant.  I was meeting a group of friends here for a cozy cocktail before we all took off to our various locations of origin for the holidays.  On a Tuesday night at 7, the lounge area was PACKED.  I couldn't believe it.  I arrived with my husband and there was only one other person from our party at the bar.  So I scouted the place out and swooped in like a hawk when I saw a party vacate a nice plush couch in the back corner.     The decor is very cozy - wood fireplaces going, low lighting, oak tables, plush couches, beautiful patio - very Spanish villa.  But I guess that this place used to be a Spanish-villa influenced private estate, so no surprise there.    So after being seated, we waited for a server.  And waited.  We noticed only one server in the entire lounge, and people were literally lining up to talk to her, either to get her attention or to simply put in orders.  It turned out she was the only server for the whole lounge!  That's not her fault, but that is definitely some poor management right there.    We ordered some food off the lounge menu and some drinks and proceeded to enjoy ourselves with our friends over the course of the next 3 hours.  I started with the Pinot Grigio and my husband had the 007 martini (or the James Bond martini?  something like that).  Both were good.  For food, we selected the calamari in aioli, the charcuterie plate, and the tenderloin burger.  The calamari was interesting to say the least - the aioli was very watery and almost mayo-y, kind of like cole slaw.  Um, ok?  The tenderloin burger was very plain.  The boursin cheese was creative but it didn't do much to help.  The applewood smoked bacon could best be described as stale - it was extremely brittle, almost hurt to bite into.  It wasn't even that it was \"crispy\" because even when bacon is properly prepared crispy it's still a little chewy.    The charcuterie plate never came.   Over the 3 hours, the crowd died down and we were able to enjoy a little more relaxing atmosphere.  But the service never improved.  Rarely did the server return to our table to check on us.  One of our friends ordered a tenderloin burger much later in the night, and it took almost 45 minutes to get to him.  After our first drinks, I ordered the Sauvingon Blanc and my husband the Russian Valley Pinot Noir.  The SB tasted like pickle juice and my husband exclaimed that it was potentially the worst PN he had ever had.       At the end of the night we got the check.  $117.  For a mediocre burger, strangely prepared calamari, a cocktail, a beer, and 4 glasses of wine between my husband and I (two of which were terrible).   Not worth it.   Worse, out of curiosity I took a look at the regular restaurant menu.  3 entrees with mushrooms (I hate mushrooms), 1 with duck (to which I'm allergic), and 2 were seafood (based on the calamari, I wouldn't go for the seafood).     So there is absolutely nothing here I would eat.  No reason to return, whatsoever.",

    "text": "As a rule, I avoid hotel restaurants.  However, I am pleased to break my rule for T. Cook's at the Royal Palms Resort.    Look no further than T. Cook's for the best place in Phoenix for a romantic dinner with your sweetie.  This place is tops in terms of atmosphere.  The grounds of the Royal Palms Resort are impeccable and the whole place has the vibe of a genteel estate you wish was handed down from generation to generation in your own family.  This place oozes Old World/Spanish Colonial charm in a good way.  Arrive a few minutes early and stroll the grounds before your dinner.  Check out the courtyard and the reflecting pool.  It's amazing to think that before this place underwent a multi-million dollar renovation, there was a pink heart-shaped pool on the grounds.  The kitsch is gone and this grand dame has been returned to her 1920s grace.    Given the spectacular setting, T. Cook's doesn't have to be as good as it is.  The BF and I have enjoyed several fine meals at this restaurant.  The decor of the restaurant is lovely, of course.  Check out the palm tree that grows up through the roof.  The room features colonial Spanish architecture, a vaulted ceiling and ubiquitous Old World elegance.  The service is also graceful and relaxed.     As for the food, the real surprise is the seafood is at T. Cook's.  In fact, the very best seafood I have eaten in Phoenix has been at T. Cook's.  I am always a sucker for lobster bisque and the version at T. Cook's is top notch.  It's lush and silky and every bit as indulgent as lobster bisque should be.  The scallops are also outstanding and perfectly prepared.  I'm not one to order fish as my entree very often, but the BF and I have done that at T. Cook's with wonderful results.  Try the seafood here, it's truly spectacular.  T. Cook's is very proud of its fire-roasted specialties and the fireplace is gorgeous and really adds to the atmosphere.  One time our waiter suggested we try the Mediterranean paella with the optional  lobster tail and claw.  This was the one main dish we would not order again.  The paella tasted like it sat around partially cooked and then they just warmed it over the fire when we ordered it.  I'd never order this dish again, but I would not let this stand in my way of coming back to T. Cook's, either.  One time we tried the Cream Cheese Brulee because it's T. Cook's signature dessert.  It's a caramel cheesecake and vanilla creme brulee served with fresh berries and guava sauce.  Unfortunately, it was sickly, sickly sweet.  I'm not a huge fan of creme brulee in general and this one didn't alter my opinion.  However, other desserts were much better.  Stop by the Lounge at T. Cook's for an after-dinner aperitif.  The atmosphere is very cozy and this place is hopping many nights.  T. Cook's also has the Delos Room for private dining.  This would be a fabulous place for an intimate dinner with up to 12 friends.  What a great place for a milestone birthday or anniversary celebration.",

    "text": "My guest ordered the beef tenderloin and I ordered the skate (yes, the 'kinda sting-ray' fish). The tenderloin was perfectly cooked as ordered (between medium-rare and rare) ... a delicious prime cut. The skate was buttery-smooth and tender ... it practically melted in my mouth!  However, our enjoyment came to a screeching halt when we ordered the \"Molten Lava Cake\". The presentation was fantastic ... a small pyramid-shaped cake next to a scoop of chocolate ice cream within a C-shaped curl of milk-chocolate. But the cake was cool to the touch, and the 'molten' chocolate interior was firm and cold. Even worse was the mini-scoop of chocolate ice cream; my guest and I both thought it tasted like chlorine!  T Cook's stepped up and brought us another lava cake (with vanilla ice cream). No chlorine taste was detected in the ice cream (whew!), but the lava cake was only marginally warmer .. .and the center was still solid ... definitely not molten. The waitress explained that the kitchen couldn't heat it up any more or the chocolate core would melt and leak out of the cake onto the plate. I've had molten lava cake at other restaurants with melted chocolate centers; if they can do it, why can't T Cook's do the same?",

The rich earthy colors are just so warm and welcoming.  Love it!  I ordered the Pan roasted halibut for dinner.  It is served with a fine herb potato gallette, sauteed mushrooms & vegetables with red wine butter sauce.  Too yummy for words to explains.  You need to try it out for yourself.  Just too terrific!!  I picked the Chocolate Fantasy (French chocolate silk on a decadent chocolate cake with chocolate sauce served with vanilla gelato) for my after dinner pleasure.  Again, too yummy for words.  This is the perfect place for the perfect date, anniversary dinners, and any romantic event.  Just one of the best dinner experiences that I have had.",

The place is very well designed, and very tranquil with fountains, and flowers. Its like you stepped into another world once you get there. The staff are very friendly. Our wait staff was on the spot consistently filling our water glasses, or replinishing our wine in our glass.  From start to finish I was impressed with the quality and taste of the food. You can taste all the flavors. I had a special from the wood burning oven, brosin stuffed chicken, with risotto, fresh greenbeans and a butternut squash reduction. It was extremely good, I have never had chicken cooked so perfectly before, so moist and tender, so good!  We definately will be visiting this place again. I think a few work dinners might be in order here too! We didnt visit the bar/lounge area. We went straight to the dining room. It got quite busy for a thursday night right around 7pm. It was good to see so business flourishing at such a nice restaurant.",

    "text": "T. Cook's is my favorite restaurant in AZ thus far. I really enjoy the spanish colonial architecture, gardens, water fountains, patio, and charming walk-ways and courtyard. The ambiance is extremely romantic and puts me in a calming, reflective mood. I can seriously see myself getting married @ the Royal Palms.   I've read some of the reviews and I've always had great service here. I remembered one of my dates had asked for a romantic corner to seat at and not only did they give us a romantic corner, but the hostess came with a basket of fresh rose petals and placed them all over our table. My date must have seriously thought he was going to get laid that night by just that gesture alone, but was mistaken, lol. Anyways, I love the lobster bisque-not too salty and just creamy enough. I've enjoyed the Asian pear salad, too which is flavorful and has great texture. But if you're looking for one appetizer to try, definitely get the sauteed shrimp & calamari in an organic yellow tomato sauce Fra Diablo. My mouth just started watering. It's not breaded calamari so it's healthier and also tastes better (5 stars).  As for the main course:  -Pan roasted duck breast with spiced confit pave, sage gnocchi & roasted butternut squash is 3 stars. I'm not much of a duck person, but the roasted butternut squash was to die for and the duck was tender.  -Wood roasted \"Pulet Rouge\" checkan with a rosemary polenta cake, asparagus and Swiss chard is 4 stars. Any meat prepared wood roasted gives it a twist in flavor, which I appreciate. I usually ask for asparagus steamed so I'm not sure how the Swiss chard is (gotta watch my figure).  -I've tried their fish (they change their menus from time to time), nibbled on my date's plates and everything has been really good.  I want to try one of their pasta dishes next time when I'm not dieting. The bar area is also super sexy, sleek and mysterious. They usually have a live piano player at night. I seriously could come here weekly for just the calamari and architecture-it's like you're in another world besides the AZ desert. It's become my escape to mini paradise.",

My recommendation is to recognize that the menu shifts in order to offer seasonal selections; and call ahead to find out what's on the chef's tasting menu.   Get that, and if you don't like the sound of what's on it, wait a couple months and call back.   Everything we've ever had here has been perfectly prepared, professionally presented in appropriate time frames, and utterly delicious.    The tasting menu consistently offers a variety of tastes so that it's difficult to be at all disappointed.   It's not someplace I would *ever* consider not planning for; it's a lot of money and it's not just dinner; it's a commitment to an evening where you just concentrate on the food and the company you keep.",

    "text": "Since moving to AZ we have gone to T. Cooks several times and each time it has been a lovely and delicious experience.   It's my favorite place to go for brunch. It's pricey and it's not a huge Vegas style buffet but all items are high quality and delicious. Plus, you can order a la carte plus the buffet and the price is the same or just a bit higher than the buffet alone. I also enjoy the decor and ambiance.   We went for dinner last night and oh my!!! It was outstanding! I knew what I was going to order ( I have an obsession with looking at menus online before hand) but they surprised me with a Farm to Table menu from Chef Lee. The \"theme\" was pork,yum! And to make it even better, 3 courses for $40.   First course was pork belly with frisee greens and a poached egg. It was so goood!! A sprinkle of salt and pepper, crusty bread to scoop the egg and it was like breakfast :D  Second course, braised pork filled ravioli with bacon, squash, pearl onions. It also had a bit of cheese (Brie?) on top. I loved every single bite of it! It was amazing, the sweetness of the squash, the salty bacon, creamy Brie and the perfectly cooked ravioli bursting with the  braised pork was just heaven!   Third course, goat cheese cheesecake with apple compote and caramel sauce. I'm not a huge fan of apple desserts but the compote was on the side.  I never had goat cheese cheesecake before (surprising since goat cheese is one of my favorite foods:) and this was great, creamy, not as tart. A perfect ending!  There was a nice lounge singer at the bar, which we were able to listen to while eating in the restaurant. Now that the weather is nice, dining on the patio was very enjoyable.  I recommend T. Cooks without reservation. I'm already looking forward to my birthday brunch there!",

After the 30 minutes, it took them 15 minutes to come to our table and ask us what we wanted(only after my brother told them we had not been waited on) HOWEVER...our drinks were compted and we were treated very well after that. The menu was great, everything was an art piece, but not pretentious. Plus, they had $6 wines. The salmon salad was fantastic and the portions were all very large, especially the burgers and the club sandwich. Obviously, it was not the restaurant's fault that they were busy(a very good thing) and they took the necessary actions to make it up to us. Very good restaurant all around.

I was very happy when he picked me up and told me he tried to make Resevations at a bigger very well known Resort just up the street, but it didn't work out, so we were going to T Cook's @ The Royal Palms. I was elated with joy because I'd rather go to a Boutique Hotel any day which is more my style and to be lucky enough to eat @ T Cook's which is one of my favorites spot, I was in heaven already.  It had been a while since I'd been there last, which made our visit that much sweeter! We got there and were greeted as soon as we arrived by the many Valets and Host.  We were escorted from Valet through the property to the Restaurant and didn't even wait for a minute before we were seated.  We sat outside on the patio; lucky for us it was unseasonably cool although the restaurant was prepared and ready with large coolers the size of a car, I'm not kidding either.  Anyway, I'm getting off track here, they served bottomless Fresh Peach Bellini's to start and the Seafood, Fruit, and Salad Buffet was not only Beautiful, but very fresh and always restocked without a morsel missing.  I'm embarrassed to say I forgot our Server's name (Too many Bellini's) but she was cute as a button, friendly, and so responsive she had the ability to know what we needed before we asked. Our entrees were over the top yummy,  cooked to perfection with plenty to share.  Too Full for dessert our server suggested we take a peek just in case we wanted a to-go container.  The desserts  are usually my fav part of a meal but I had leftovers already from my main course, because the portions were very ample especially after the buffet beginnings.  Servers' know best, she told me to try the blondies and the mousse, so without hesitation I grab a few sweet treats to share at the table. BTW: she is the reason I packed a few to go (My tummy & butt thank you). My only suggestions would be music loud enough to hear, creme brulee on the dessert table, and list the contents of salads since so many have food allergies, etc (one of our guest was a Vegan).  I applaud you and thank you for a wonderful Mother's Day Brunch! Cheers!!!",

This sizable delight is carnivore candy for the soul. Ten ounces of tenderloin burger with white cheddar cheese, bacon and Guiness tempura onion rings on a ciabatta bun with a grain mustard aioli.

The service was really attentive and polite, but Michael (and the others) also recognized when to remain on the sidelines when people were \"making speeches\" and otherwise honoring the senior guests.

Michael did a good job in selecting wines (and lots of it) that were really good, but not bank-breaking.  T Cook's is not inexpensive, but the prices and the quality match as well as anyplace in town.  It was a great experience all the way around.

My fish was overcooked and no apology made when I had it sent back.  I used to just love this restaurant - all the history and fine service  Not anymore.  The matredee stood at his desk gossiping with 2 friends while we waited and waited to be acknowledged.  Sad......this used to be one of the best.",

This year, we decided to go for breakfast, and boy and I glad we did!   The food is always good at T Cooks. We've enjoyed dinner here a couple times and they always treat you nicely and make a special occasion even more special. So, our breakfast was great. I had the croissant sandwich and my Husband had the pesto omelet. He LOVED the pesto flavor in his omelet, as well as the english muffin it came with and the apple cinnamon jam. It really was fabulous. My croissant sandwich was to die for. I loved how they mixed the cheese in the eggs and the eggs were cooked just right - not overdone.   The waitress was so nice, she noticed it was my Husband's bday and brought him a plate that said \"happy birthday\" and had some truffles.   Love, Love, Love T Cooks and Royal Palms - you must go!",

The location they were using was absolutely charming. Our waiter was so attentive and engaging. The food was beautifully prepared and plated.

    "text": "I remembered I loved the atmosphere here so I tried it again.   I went with a group of three others.  This time, the food was better than I had remembered.   But there were two hiccups that come to mind.  The first hiccup was at the beginning of the evening when we arrived 15 mins before our reservation to be told that there would be a wait because a very large group came before us.  Hey, I didn't really mind because as a matter of fact, we were early.    However, we sat in the lounge/bar and spent close to 40 dollars on four glasses of what was a very poor imitation of sangria.  Having been to Spain and having had the legit, elixir of the gods, that even non-drinkers have been known to fall in love with, I didn't expect as much.  But then again, I didn't expect Hi-C Fruit Punch.    20 mins AFTER our reservation time, we were seated...   But from then on, everything was pretty much smooth sailing.    We ordered the sweetbreads & bone marrow, escargot, antipasto plate, and the mussels for appetizer courses.  Antipasto plate was awesome, lots of different things to nibble on and share with others.    Mussels were good and the portions were big, considering this was a \"fancy\" restaurant where portions tend to be miniature servings.  I can't remember if it came with bread or if we used the bread from the antipasto plate or house bread that came, but we were all sloppin' up the juice from the mussels!  Escargot... Usually served either in a unique dish that holds the individual shells and you pop them out with a miniature fork; or cooked together with other ingredients but still in its shell.  At T. Cook's, they do all the work for you, serving the snails out of its shell cooked with the other ingredients... It was good, but I didn't like that it took the \"special\" out of a typical escargot dish.  It's like going to eat crabs and all the meat was already picked out for you...  Or sunflower seeds already out of its shell...  The sweetbreads and marrow dish really sucked the last time I came here but ordered it anyways because there really aren't many chances to order this type of \"offal\" dish in Arizona.  This time, it really was good.  Very well prepared and delish!  However, we were wondering what sweetbreads were called in Spanish.  We got our young Hispanic waiter who spoke Spanish by the way and asked him.  I'm not fluent, but hearing \"pan\" and \"dulce\" were not what I was expecting... I was like \"Uhmmm... Excuse me, this isn't bread...\"  He was \"It's not like a bread pieces glazed with a sweet sauce?\"  I had to pull out my phone and look it up.  Holy moly!  A waiter who doesn't even know what he's serving?  Is that acceptable T. Cooks???   By the way, sweetbreads are Molleja in Spanish.  We also had 4 soups or salads, 4 entrees, and 4 desserts; nothing really outstanding or super memorable from what I remember.  Along with a 50 dollar-ish bottle of wine, our bill was around 410 without tip.",

He wanted an intimate/romantic dinner to celebrate so we glamoured up thinking this was going to be a very dressy kind of place. We were wrong. Upon walking into the restaurant we felt very overdressed in my cocktail dress and he in his newly bought suit. Most of the people dining there were in summer shorts and polos. Looked more like they were dressed to go golfing! Regardless, we greatly enjoyed our romantic dinner. The lights in the dining area were dim and wasn't loud at all. It was the perfect intimate setting.  We shared a pear salad and crab cake to start with. The salad left a little to be desired, but the crab cake was DELICIOUS! For the entree he had the beef tenderloin and I had the salmon. He won that choice! We shared the Raspberry Charlotte for desset. It was absolutely out of this world! Probably one of the best desserts I've ever had. The portion was huge, we could barely finish it between the two of us.  The waiter was VERY attentive and friendly. He made great recommendations on food and wine (which paired perfectly with our meal) and we didnt feel rushed at all between courses. He cleared our plates diligently after we finished each meal and always carefully whipped our table before bringing out the next course. Best service we've ever had at a restaurant!  After we finished our dinner we walked around in the courtyard for a bit. It was beautiful! The trees were decorated in lights and the fountains were on and lit which created a romantic setting for us two love birds. We'll definitely be back!",

I was not able to make it to the dinner celebration, so I decided to send them a bottle of Champaign for this special occasion.  The restaurant manager, Christian, was amazing.  He patiently answered my questions on the phone and by emails.  He assured me that the dinner party would be well taken care of.  My aunts and uncles had a marvelous time the whole evening.  All I heard were praises about the good time they had at the restaurant.  One of my aunts posted a comment on facebook, \"The service at the restaurant was superb. A big shout-out to Jeff, our waiter and the employees at the Palm Resort, who were also in on the plan.\"  One of my uncle also posted, \"We had a wonderful dinner, then we went into the bar and there was a duo playing so we danced until the band packed up and left. It turned out to be a magical evening.\"    Thank you for wonderful service.  You guys are awesome!  Please continue to be the stars you are at the restaurant.",

The stuffiness comes along with the prices, the clientele who can afford said prices, the wine sales push, and the insistence on repeatedly calling me \"Mister L.\" (which felt odd considering my relative youth). Aside from that, a pleasant experience for an early dinner.  Highlights included the antipasto platter with lots of things made in-house; the mixed greens salad (complete with a goat cheese tart!); and a pair of decadent desserts (who knew what guava could do for a creme brulee). The paella (a T. Cooks signature) was surprisingly just \"good\" (which says something of otherwise high standard) - the seafood was fresh and the dish was big enough to serve three, but it was quite salty. The other three people in my party, though, had no such complaints about their entrees.",

Highlight of the night was definitely the dessert , their caramel crime brulee is like nothing I've tried before, it was the best I ever had, and typically I'm not a big fan of crime brulee, but I just couldn't resist!!!

You can't go wrong no matter how you dine here. The bar has a great atmosphere, inventive cocktails and the gourmet popcorn is addictive. Dinner is an elegant atmosphere you can still feel comfortable in and nothing compares to their signature pesto that comes with the bread. Even breakfast here this morning was healthy but totally satisfying. Our server Tanino met my every (probably annoying!) request with a great alternative suggestion that made my meal even better - no bread under your eggs Benedict? How about spinach? He was awesome.   Thanks for being such a consistent and classy operation T Cooks.",

    "text": "Friends off ours asked if we would like to go to T Cook's Sunday Brunch their treat! WoW. Best part of the meal was the time we shared with our friends. The meal was good also but you can't beat being with friends.  Our reservation was for 11:15. We were seated soon after we arrived. Had a choice of inside or outside. We chose inside and outside would of been a realistic choice since we was having great weather. If you have not been to the Royal Palms resort, it is really a nice place to visit for a meal, stay at the resort?  When you pull in you will be in a small circle area where the only parking is valet. We were greeted and relieved or our car keys. The valet is free, tips appreciated.  As I said we were seated and explained how the buffet worked. The food was good and of a high quality. Beacon was twice the thickness of most places. Eggs to order and anything you could think of was provided, many items you would never of thought of. Shrimp that was 3/4 inches thick and 3 inches long of more, crab claws pealed and ready to pick the meat and eat.  Many types of bread along with all the toppings. The offerings was endless. Much to much for me to remember and write down.  All you can eat means all you can eat. Not that you should eat all you can eat. I know I had more that I should of eaten. We had a great meal and better conservation with our friends. This was a real treat.  Now my only criticism is this. Yes we were there longer than most, but the room always had 10 or so empty tables and we felt comfortable sitting and enjoying each others company. It was obvious they wanted us to go as they kept coming by asking if they could clean the table, need carry out box, and finally a rude suggestion that it was time to go. If the room had been packed I could understand, maybe.. The meal was good the company was better, the customer service could use some work.",

Several workers were walking around preparing for their brunch rush, understandably so, but what about the people dinning? There was only one server working at the time, she seemed overwhelmed working a rather large area with tables scattered. We weren't in a rush so the service wasn't an inconvenience to us, but I would have liked more interaction and insight on the menu. We both ordered the Mediterranean Eggs Benedict. For being on their menu for 18+ years, I was underwhelmed. My poached eggs were cooked all the way through and the hollandaise sauce was a very generous amount for the dish.  Overall, the service and food won't have me returning for more.",

    "text": "This negative review is not because of the quality of the food. I would give the food a 4, and the service, a negative 2. We made a reservation for my wife's big birthday year, and got dressed up for the occasion. This place is supposed to be known as one of those places to go when it's a special occasion.  The waiter seemed like a good guy until he got lost sometime after placing the food order. He literally did not show up again until the plates were being carried away by the assistant-- we had no check-in's (not one) from the time we ordered our meal until the plates were taken away, and the restaurant was not all that busy. It was very surprising to us. But because the food was generally good, we let it slide and didn't get our feathers ruffled. I wanted to ask him a question or two, but we made it through the meal just fine without him.   When I ordered my food, I made a very large point about an allergy. I have to make that clear, as I have a four-alarm allergy to eggs. I literally can't be anywhere near an egg (my eyes turn bright red if someone's cooking something with eggs on the microwave and I walk through the kitchen). So, no problems developed with eggs during the meal. When we did see the waiter again later, it was a big push for desserts. They knew at the hostess stand and in my OpenTable reservation that it was my wife's birthday, so we were surprised when he came out with a desert and two spoons on a plate that said Happy Anniversary. Oops.   But it was this dessert that did me in. He had placed a spoon right down in front of me, and he knew about my egg allergy. But just in case, I asked him again \"Hey, what is this dessert anyway? Would it have eggs?\" and he replied \"I have no idea what's in that glass, they always have something different for us. At least you could eat the chocolate and whipped cream off the top!\"   Sort of a dumb comment. Most restaurants, if it were truly an anniversary (and ours wasn't, it was my wife's birthday) would provide me with a sorbet or something eggless and allow my wife to enjoy the original item. In this case, he just walked away and did what he does best -- disappear. I took his advice and took the chocolate off the top of the treat.  Within moments, I had to rush and vomit up my $60 meal because that wasn't chocolate, and that wasn't whipped cream on top. It was pure egg white of some kind, and that ruined the evening for both of us. Nothing was adjusted, no apology from the waiter -- NOT AT ALL. Mentioned it to the hostess on the way out, no rush to get a manager, etc. This place could care less. They've been there for so long, they've had the reputation they have for years . . . But it's clear to me that's going to eventually crumble, because they have a \"who cares\" attitude about allergies, and in today's restaurant business you can't afford to take that risk.  To top it off  . . . When I went to the rest room to be sick, the waiter scooped the dessert off the table and took it away, despite the fact that Birthday Girl was still enjoying her Happy Anniversary treat!  Edited January 12 2018 -- Moved from 2 Stars to 5.  I posted my review earlier after a great disappointment. I just want readers to know that because I mentioned to the Valet that I had a bad experience as I was leaving the parking lot, I had a call from the office staff at this restaurant. I went back -- no allergy issues, wonderful service, and an incredible meal. I'm left feeling that this was simply a one-off bad situation, with a bad waiter. My service was impeccable on the second go-round, and my partner feels as I do, that it was one of the most memorable meals in our experience.",

I snagged it and went with my husband and 3 year old son a few weeks ago.   I am not a fan of buffets, but this is one buffet I will definitely be back to - and soon! It was fresh, plenty of selection, and I felt like I actually was able to eat my money's worth. Not only do they have fresh seafood, cheeses, meats, salad, fruit, waffles, eggs and pretty much anything you could want, but the desserts are so good!!   Our son ate for free and I believe I read somewhere that kids under 12 eat free with a paying parent. That is amazing to me!! So many places over-charge for kids these days.   Everyone was so kind. The service could be a bit slow, but I also like that at no point were we rushed. It gave us time to eat, relax, let one plate settle, and get another.   I will be back and hopefully soon!",

    "text": "T. Cook's at the Royal Palms Resort royally ruined our 20th anniversary dinner.  I had read glowing reviews about the chef's off-menu lobster paella for two.  Since my husband is a paella aficionado, we decided this would be a lovely way to celebrate our anniversary.  I contacted T. Cook's over three weeks prior to our anniversary to find out if we would be able to order the lobster paella for dinner.  I received an email from Royal Palms Resort assuring me that T. Cooks's would be happy to accommodate us for our anniversary, acknowledging the availability and price of the paella, and even following up with a confirmation through Open Table.  I responded by affirming that, for the chef's planning purposes, we would be ordering the paella.  When we arrived on the evening of our anniversary, the hostess was very welcoming and verified our reservation.  She seated us at a table for two with a view of the courtyard and Camelback Mountain and then surprised us by sprinkling rose petals on our tabletop, which we considered a thoughtful gesture.  The wait staff were attentive and solicitous.  As we were considering wine selections, the waiter began to discuss entrees and we told him that we had pre-ordered the lobster paella for two.  He looked surprised and said that he would have to check with the chef.  When he returned, he apologized, told us the paella was not available, and asked what we would like to order instead.  We told him that we didn't want to order anything else and that we had made our reservation several weeks earlier specifically for the lobster paella.  (After moving to Scottsdale a little over a year ago, we compiled a list of restaurants to try for our weekly date night and omitted T. Cook's due to its otherwise unremarkable menu when compared to commensurate venues.)  The waiter apologized repeatedly.  Although irritated and disappointed, we were not upset with him because it was not his fault, but we got up and left.  As we passed by the hostess station, the hostess looked alarmed and asked what was wrong.  We explained the situation and she replied that there surely must be a mistake and that she would check with the manager.  When she returned, she seemed quite crestfallen to confirm that indeed there was no paella to be had, apologized profusely, and asked if she could provide us with some type of certificate for another visit.  We refused since we won't be returning and left.  When we picked up our car from the valet, the same scenario ensued--concerned inquiry followed by apologies.  By now, my husband was quite blunt about how T. Cook's had messed up, using far more colorful language.  The only thing that impressed us about T. Cook's was how graciously the staff attempted to handle an unpleasant situation that was not their fault.  Bad form, management.",

The cookies, a lavender shortbread, an orange ricotta (I could have eaten a baker's dozen of these yummy morsels) and a chocolate macaroon, were the perfect complement to the vanilla, chocolate and sea salt caramel gelato.

As we moved our way into the party room, it took longer than expected for water, we actually had to ask for it.  I started with the mussels and they were very good, small though.  My husband started with the antipasti which was good.  My husbands grandpa tried the lobster bisque which he said was very good. He also had the fois gras (sp?) liver.  First time trying it and I thought it was very good actually.  As my entree I ordered the lamb which looked amazing on the plate, however lacked any sort of flavor.  It was very bland so I was a bit disappointed.  My husband had the filet and he also said he's had better, also bland.  The wine pairing was great, my husband was left without a drink or water for a long time, even though the server had been in the room a few times.  Overall, (8 people), nobody was raving about the food.  It was a bit of a let down, even the dessert.  3/3 people said it was too rich.  I would come back for the lounge and apps but probably not for the full dining experience.  The grounds are amazing and very pretty but there is better food out there especially for the price range.",

    "text": "T. Cook's and I have a long history but T. doesn't know it.  The first time I met him was over ten years ago when I was just making it in this town.  I had reached my goal for my office and in celebration, I took some of my friends and biggest cheerleaders there to celebrate.  T's food went right to my g-spot and I had an orgasmic reaction right there at the table.   I saved T for special occassions.  The next time I went was again for some celebratory occassion with some friends and once again, T's food went right to my g-spot and I had another orgasmic reaction. The third time, I've been spoiled so I was secretly rubbing my legs together under their pristine table linen in anticipation and didn't care who saw me as I licked every delectable morsel off of my plate and fingers, groaning with pleasure. With gloating praise of T., I got a group of friends together for a private dining experience at the Delano Room (min. $500 spending) for a holiday dinner this past Christmas.  When making the reservation, the lady was a bit snubby which I can accept when I am anticipating another orgasmic experience.   We gather for a evening of fine dining . . . except this time, T. had performance anxiety and failed me.  First the waitress looked like she was overworked and coming into the Delano Room was an inconvinence to her because she has just way too many tables outside that were more important to her.  When my dish came, it had been under the heat lamp for so long that it was completely shriveled that I could not tell what dish I had ordered.  I gave her one look and without a word, she took the dish back and asked me if I would like to order another dish.  Where my g-spot was left high and dry was when we got the bill, the antipasto dish that the waitress had recommended we ordered as a 3-person portion was a whopping $45 per plate.  She had said that \"some\" additional amount would be added for a larger portion- she neglected to clarify that it would be a whopping 3x's the amount.  And we had 2 plates of those . . . $90 for 2 antipasto plates??   So what was supposed to be my most savory experience with T. was completely anticlimatic and totally blemished my memory of him. I know T's popular so he'll have many suitors- just not this one.",

    "text": "Get your credit card ready. As long as you go in knowing you may be spending a little more than usual for the nice dinner, you'll be okay. I was staying at The Royal Palms and this was the on-site restaurant. Honestly, it's hard, anywhere, to find a hotel with as good a restaurant as this. Dress nicely. Not that they'll turn you away, but the meal is so good, you almost feel obligated. The interior is beautifully decorated, but the outdoor seating is worth taking advantage of if the weather cooperates. The comfortable cushioned chairs are almost like thrones. The service. Props to my waiter, one of the best I've had in a long time. As someone with nut and peanut allergies, I can't remember the last time I felt this comfortable at a meal. Just watching him at work with other guests too, he wanted to make sure you felt taken care of. Now the food. Panzanella salad with butter toasted brioche, mixed greens, fresh mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes, and basil vinaigrette. Fresh, simple, and rejuvenating. Lovely. Duck a L'Orange with duck breast, leg, and thigh, candied orange, asparagus, thyme fondant potatoes, and traditional sauce. This is one of the best ducks I've ever had. It is also the most generous portion of duck I've had: breast, leg, and thigh! As I was savoring each bite, the waiter came and simply said, \"Life is good?\" \"Life is excellent,\" I replied. The side of butter-poached lobster sealed the deal. Eclairs to satisfy the sweet tooth and a cappuccino to buy time to soak it all in. It's the kind of meal that is so satisfying that all you want to do is go home and go to bed. There's no point in doing anything the rest of the night since there's no way to top it. An added plus is if you stay at The Royal Palms, your room is a short walk away.",

I have hoped for wonderful meals at this nice restaurant but everything I've tried has been a tremendous disappointment.  Anyone who thinks they are going to get decadent food at this extremely expensive hotel will be hugely disappointed.  F-.  Outrageously disappointing.  WTF.",

    "text": "I thought we were in for a treat last Friday night as my wife and I, along with a friend, went to T. Cooks for the first time. And it was a beautiful setting no doubt about it. The problem was with the food. All three dishes were lacking in taste, bland, and far below the anticipated standard. For the record they were the sea bass,  the mushroom ravioli, and the scallops. I had the sea bass and while there was no problem with the quality of the fish itself, it was entirely lacking flavor, a tasteless fish with greens underneath that added zero to the dish. My wife had the raviolo which tasted, as she put it, like mushroom paste in beef broth. Our companion described the scallops as \"okay\". Perhaps our expectations were too high. One dish is, while not acceptable, understandable perhaps as part of the dining experience on occasion. However, all three dishes being below par for a restaurant such as this is a huge disappointment. I don't  know the cause but I do know the solution.",

The courtyard was magical and I would have sat out there, but it was a bit cold--i think they have fires out there on cold weekend nights.  We sat inside near the bathroom (which later proved to add entertainment value when a couple was busted hooking up in a men's stall).  Anyway, we had an assortment of wine, beer and martinis.  I tasted my friends' and they were unanimously tasty!  I enjoyed the live music and the people watching was superb--some of Scottsdale's finest surgical augmentation and both male and female cougars!  I will definitely be back and would like to try my friends' recommendation of a 2 day, 1 night getaway without travel with spa, exercise, pool, fine dining, and of course drinks in the courtyard at night!",

I have trouble making food decisions, it's a known fact, so when I turned the menu over and realized I could order half a salad and half a sandwich, I was sold! But then came the hard part, which deliciously sounding salad paired with which 'wich?! Our served told us that the Asian Pear Salad with spiced pecans was a specialty so that was a no brainer. But the difficulty came debating betwen the short rib, smokey turkey and grilled chicken. The braised shortrib on a baguette won-I'm a sucker for good short rib!  The salad was perfect, a nice balance of sweet from the pears and savory from the pecans with a zippy balsamic dressing that brought the whole thing together nicely. The sandwich was good, not the best braised short rib I ever had, but it was a half a sandwich, hard to tell, you know?  Next time I go back to T. Cook's I want to order the real deal, their full braised short rib, and I want to sit at the bar. I've read good things about the experience there pulling up a stool and can't believe I left the place without even taking a peak at the thing! Next time T. Cook's, next time!",

I'm sure the ambiance hasn't changed. I need to revisit so I can give an updated review about the food.",

Cook's, however the three courses for $40 was a great deal for us and as long as we are able to take advantage of this special pricing we will be back.   The ambiance was wonderful.   I had the calamari and shrimp first course, which was delicious. She had the red onion and rosemary soup with havarti cheese, which was also delicious  We both went with the lobster toretllini which was really tasty and had lots of lobster but some the lobster pieces were a little bit chewy. The tortellini was delicious as was the lettuce that came with it.   Desert was outstanding. We shared the chocolate fantasy - very very rich chocolate that when combined with the  vanila gelato and cherries was a great combination. The caramel cheesecake creme brulee was also fantastic. It was much lighter than the chocolate fantasy, which was very dense.   The wine suggestions of our waiter went great with the meal.   Service was oustanding - they were very attentive and friendly - We never felt rushed and didn't have to ask for anything.   As I mentioned above as long as we can take advantage of the 3 courses for $40 we will back again. There is so much more of the menu we want to try.",

The specials offered something traditional but also creative.  Recommend the pate appetizer and squash soup for a start.

Most of us at the table ordered their eggs benedict which was very good.  Small homemade biscuits with a pesto sauce on it and the hollandaise had a tomato and red pepper flavor.. yum!

The food was alright, but certainly not 5 star quality. The wine was pretty good, but the waiter was a little snooty about it. Granted we don't know much about wine, but that was precisely why we asked for a recommendation. He acted like we were some loosers for not knowing each wine by name.   The second time I was there was for mother's day, when I was pregrant. I wanted to give them another chance, but it was once again quite dissapointing. The quality of the food is disproportionate to the price and the service was once again pompous and almost discriminatory. I realised we were the only non-white people at that place, but come on, you can't refill our water glasses when you pass us by to refill at the next table? We sat with empty water glasses for almost 15 minutes. That's not service, especially for what you pay!",

The deserts were fair and worst of all my hot tea which costs $4.50 was weak and cool. I think I must be spoiled by fine dining in LA and NYC. Will not be back. Service was excellent though.

Its cozy, dim lighting, wood accents, and perfect lounge with a live singer set the mood for the night. The court yard in front of the restaurant was breath taking, even in the moonlight, filled with cobble stones and fresh flowers.   For eats, I had the cheese and meats board to start. Perfectly fresh cheeses!! I had a bite of a friends risotto and it was simple, yet perfectly flavored with a dash of parmesan. For a main, I had the pork chop with gnocchi. The chop was fabulous but the gnocchi was nothing special, considering their were only about 4-5 little tiny ones on the plates. This was obliviously just for show, not for filling up your belly, by any means. The red velvet cake for desert was equal parts moist and decedent. Truly a great desert, and I'm not a fan of deserts.   I fell in love with this place. I will be back one day!",

We heard the restaurant was recently renovated and got a different menu and everything, so we were very excited to try.   For appetizer, we got the foie gras which probably was one of the best dishes in our opinion. A tiny piece of foie gras sitting on a sizzling hot stone, combined with orange bread and sauce. It was perfection. We couldn't love it more. Though very pricey, but it's worth it.   Then we got a garden apple salad, which the waiter told us the veggies were grown in T Cook's garden. Pretty cool huh? of course it was very fresh and delicious.   For entrees, my fiance got a steak. he shared a little bit with me and it was soooo tender and buttery, like melting in my mouth. the seasoning was so tasty and just perfect.  I originally wanted the pork tenderloin, but they ran out. So I chose to get the duck dish instead. It was great, but duck itself is often too rich. Me being a 5'1 petite lady was almost full on the foie gras and salad, couldn't finish it.   We didn't get any dessert because we were so full! But overall, we enjoyed the night very much.",

    "text": "If you judge T. Cook's against restaurants in general, it probably deserves 5 stars, but if you judge it against what it purports to be, 4 is more accurate.  T. Cook's is a resort-style fine dining establishment.  The attentive valet parking, impressive entranceway, decor, and certainly the prices prove that.  It falls into the class of gourmet fine dining in most respects, but I have long had a problem with the food being unimaginative and the flavor profiles being too simple -- take the arugula salad, for example, which had a strong dried cranberry flavor but nothing else.  That said, T. Cooks has improved over the past few years and certainly has many good points.  The food is very well prepared (the John Dory was excellent), the wait staff is certainly knowledgeable, and the restaurant is attractive and not too noisy.  You won't have a bad experience here until the check arrives.  Of course, you expected the check because you saw their menu (maybe even online before you arrived).  But after finishing the meal, the net effect is \"this could have been really great if only ...\"  Tip:  before you go here, you might consider buying the Preferred Restaurants of Phoenix card.  Sunday through Thursday (or early on weekends), this gives you two entrees for the price of one, saving you $30-$40, and the card costs less than twice that.  Then you have a year to try about 30 other places.",

    "text": "Seriously, come here.  I showed up hobbling around with a crutch and the hostess went above and beyond to give me what I needed.  Made a reservation for Saturday brunch. Showed up the day before and asked for champagne to be on the table and to have a card I wrote waiting for my boyfriend (his birthday!).   Arrived the next morning, everything in order as asked, and they were very accommodating with my limp leg.   Ambiance is wonderful. The seats are extremely comfortable, music is at a nice listening volume, timing from all staff was on point (never felt like I was waiting or rushing for anything).   Food is fantastic. Definitely have the cauliflower bisque! A wonderful way to start the brunch. Their Mediterranean Benedict was lovely and the Graham Cracker French Toast was rich and a great desert to the amazing brunch.   You can also walk around the grounds to help digest! The resort is beautiful and great for a stroll.",

    "text": "In September my husband and I stayed at the Royal Palms Resort.  We had breakfast and dinner at T Cooks several times; so my review is for multiple meals.  First, we had breakfast on the beautiful patio amongst the trellis and - I started with a bellini; and a lobster omelet.  Loved both of these menu items and I would highly recommend them.  The service was exceptional for this meal. She even offered to make us a reservation for a table for that evening.  We came back for dinner that evening and sat in the dining room. I ordered a glass of rose wine, and didn't like it. I also ordered the scallops which were disappointing and almost inedible. They were small and there were three of them. All three of them had not been rinsed and it was like eating sand. Two nights later we had dinner in the lounge area and the food was good again (that lounge location might have a different name).  This is a beautiful restaurant, and the food options were mixed for me.",

It was my birthday & sat in the back patio & we absolutely loved it ! Charming, romantic & delicious food ! Our waiter Tanino was super friendly without being overpowering. We chatted about our travels to Europe & how this hotel/restaurant made us feel like we were back in Europe.   Everything was perfect .... Including the weather !

    "text": "It was my father-in-law's birthday, one of those big milestone birthdays, and he chose to have the family take him to dinner at T Cook's.  T Cook's is recommended a lot in the foodie blogs, often along with Kai and Binkley's.   I haven't had dinner there in probably 10 years or more so was looking forward to trying their current menu.  The wine list is awfully good and as you would expect, the prices reflect it, though I was able to get a very good reasonably priced bottle of Cab which would go well with the lamb I and a few others planned to order...which turned into 2 bottles.  Here's where the experience started going off the rails.  T Cook's has a pretty short entree menu.  They ran out of the lamb, leaving only 8 other entrees to choose from.  There were no specials.    I asked the waitress for a recommendation and she suggested the pappardelle.  What arrived looked nothing like the menu's description.  Where were the morels?  What are these peas doing in here?  And I'm just an ignorant Phoenician, but this thick doughy slab bears no resemblance to any pappardelle I've ever had...or even pasta.  The person sitting to my left, a cultured gentleman with impeccable manners, ordered it too saying it looked to be a dish that would say a lot about the chef.  He politely dubbed it \"interesting\".  The Birthday Boy deemed the cod watery.  Being a fish, watery could be a virtue, but I don't think he meant it that way.  The other meals were deemed good, but at these prices I would have expected at least one person at the table to be rolling their eyes in their head and moaning.  Dessert was the point where I figured I may as well take out every dollar in my wallet and set them afire.  At least I get some entertainment and warmth from the fire; not disappointment then embarrassment.  The waitress eavesdropped on us to find out just how old our guest of honor was turning that day, a number I deliberately had not shared with the restaurant out of respect for the Birthday Boy who really didn't want to hear it.  When it came time to sing Happy Birthday, there was a complimentary dessert placed in front of him with his age piped in large chocolate numbers on the plate for all to see.  Ugh.  Cringe.  What other words can I insert here to convey the utter embarrassment?  I am a dessert eater. Scratch that - I will eat my dessert and most of everyone else's at the table.  No kidding.  Not tonight.  These desserts were the kind that are little bits of something I can't recognize all over the plate, but none of them satisfy my sweet tooth.  Can't remember the last time I didn't like my dessert.  Kind of made me want to cry.  We and the Birthday Boy forced ourselves to have a good time in spite of everything.  Then we forced ourselves to pay the $700 bill, along with the tip they forced onto it.",

We typically eat here when we stay at Royal Palms, so having a $50 meal credit softens the blow.  Dinner IS pricey...  Presentation is obviously big here.  Portion sizes are just right.  you won't be stuffed...you will have room for 3 courses.    I generally order something unique here.  not your typical \"filet\"...go to Donovan's or Dominick's for that.  I think entree's are best.  Apps/soups are #2.  Dessert usually isn't the best part of the meal here.  they almost try too hard with the desserts.  they need to find a couple staples for dessert and make them home runs...i just haven't found that (yet).  Beet salad.  butternut squash soup.  antelope.  lamb.  scallops.  all winners.  enjoy",

I'd recommend checking this place out.  The brunch was my first time trying, for the money you get a lot and it doesn't resemble a college cafeteria like some places do. It's pretty high end stuff with fresh seafood, pasty, cured meats, and some traditional favorites. I highly recommend trying the brunch. The other meals were great, we tried regular breakfast, lunch, and the late night offerings and found everything to be delicious.",

    "text": "Excellent Food - Horrible Service, Badly Managed & Understaffed  Our experience here was bad enough to deduct a star from the Royal Palm hotel. While the food was excellent [Pork Chops / Scallops / broccolini & mushrooms], the service was horrible. We arrived at ~6:30pm on a Sunday - we waited at the empty host station for several minutes. Maybe 5 tables were occupied in the restaurant & a couple of tables outside.  We watched 2 waiters back & forth a couple of times -  they saw us but took no action - not even a 'someone will be with you in a minute'. No other service or management present that we saw. Finally I walked into the path of one of the waiters & asked to be seated - which he did (outside). (Waiter #1356570)  Which began the big 'wait' - wait to place (then get) drinks, a meal order, get butter, ice water, we never got our table cleared between courses - just pushed the empty plates to the side like the Mad Hatter's tea party.   We frequently had to catch the other waiter's attention because ours was so rarely around or so focused on where he was going we couldn't catch his attention - that waiter was polite was visibly annoyed - hopefully at the missing waiter. Finally at the end, my husband went into the restaurant searching for any employee & was stepping into the kitchen when the 'other waiter' stepped out. We never saw a manager or additional wait staff. However, we had the impression that our waiter wasn't overwhelmed due to his number of covers but because he was off doing other stuff. (The number of occupied tables had declined considerably in the 1.5 hours we were there.) Because I left a message on the receipt regarding our bad experience, I explained the reasons for our discontent directly to our waiter. Who nodded & said he was sorry & then was off.",

I also appreciated that the staff was friendly and eager to give us the best service possible.   On the savory side of the meal, I had the short rib (a la carte) with the whipped potatoes, and I was very pleased with my choices. The short rib was extremely tender and fell apart easily with a fork (my favorite part of any tasty short rib). I also enjoyed the whipped potatoes and roasted Brussels sprouts.  For dessert, we had a sampling of 3 desserts (I came here with my parents so these weren't all for me, unfortunately). My favorite was the Peach Bread Pudding, which was the seasonal at the time. The bread pudding was moist and super rich in flavor, but the peaches lightened it up nicely. I also enjoyed the Crema Catalina creme brulee, though it was a little toooo heavy on the citrus for me to finish. Finally, the Mocha Torte was beautifully presented, but also a little too decadent and chocolate-heavy for me. Or maybe the Old Fashioned Bread Pudding had already won me over. Either way, I would recommend T. Cook's for a nice dinner out, and take some time to explore the resort grounds while you're there!",

We started with the spinach and lentil soup, had the venison strip loin and pork chops for dinner, and then the cheesecake and tartufo for dessert. The food was the best we've eaten in a very, very long time.   For drinks, the Muscow Mule was very strong on the ginger, and very tasty. My girlfriend requested a version of the Love Potion without ginger, and the bartender created a drink she enjoyed thoroughly. We got a Merlot and Pinot Noir with dinner, both of which were alright. Neither were outstanding for the price, but it did not detract from the overall experience.  We highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great atmosphere, delicious food, and fantastic service. Request Sasha.",

The dining room is so dated.  I understand the \"old Arizona\" feel that they are going for, but it just feels out of step and really needs a redo.  We were greeted right away by a young man who offered water and other beverages, but we had brought ours from the bar.  We sat for quite a while before I finally asked for bread.  I had not eaten lunch and was starving!  It came quickly with a delicious pesto dipping sauce, but the bread itself seemed like what you get from the bakery at Safeway.  Soft and bland.  Several of us ordered from the Restaurant week menu.  The scallop dish arrived for my friend and it was raw.  She called over a woman who turned out to be the manager.  She handled it well whisking away the plate and returning to say a new one was being retired.  When the plate returned, the scallop which had been sliced in half by my friend returned cooked through, but clearly the same one that had gone back.  The entrees were good, no complaints there.  But the service during dinner was abismal.  One of us had to keep refilling our water goblets from a pitcher that was near by.  The woman trying to open our wine clearly did not understand how to do it, so we had to open our own wine.  We also had to refill our own glasses throughout the meal.  Several times when we wanted something we looked up to find not a single server on the floor of the dining area.  Dessert came for those of us who had ordered the Prix fixe menu, but those of us who did not were not even asked if we wanted a dessert!  I asked for a menu and ordered the deconstructed strawberry shortcake.  The strawberries were good, the rest of it inedible.  The other deserts were also left relatively untouched.  They were all awful.  This restaurant used to be our go to for special occasions many years ago, but now it just doesnt work.",

He had a great personality and was very patient with all of my questions. The pacing was perfect.  Their focaccia bread with pesto was amazing. Freshly baked, great flavor, and wonderful olive oil.   The octopus appetizer was incredible. It was perfectly cooked, which is one of the hardest culinary feats. Most places overlook it, but they prepared it so it cut like butter. Served with a great olive tapenade.  The black truffle soup was probably the best soup I've had this year. The strong truffle flavor was complimented by the cream base.  And for the entree, the best lamb dish of my life. Perfect medium rare, served with homemade tatziki sauce, feta, and cucumbers. It was accompanied with falafel.  Overall, one of the best restaurants in Phoenix, and very romantic.",

As local stay-cation guests at the hotel we arrived for our reservation on time to find that we had to wait 15 minutes for a table when in fact the restaurant wasn't busy.  We got seated outdoors - absolutely beautiful and a romantic ambiance for sure!  We ordered the cheese/meat platter for an appetizer to start - it was very good.  We waited a long time between each portion of the dinner to be served; too long as I lost my hunger and desire to eat by the time our entres arrived.  The salad was basic - apples walnuts and greens; nothing special.  My husband ordered the scallop dinner and I the duck.  The scallops were fair, they were barely warm and gritty which was a disappointment.  The short rib ravioli that accompanied the scallops were dry and not very tasty.  My duck was overcooked which I could deal with however the cabbage that it was served with was not a delight - there was raw garlic shavings mixed in and added quite the bite of flavor in not a pleasant way.  We did enjoy the homemade chocolate ice cream for dessert.    Overall, the ambiance was wonderful but the food and timing of courses has a long way to go to compete with other fine and delicious local restaurants close by!  The price of the food was expensive based on the quality served.",

The Resort entry & valet parking is very impressive! (1st class)  You will walk thru a beautiful Spanish Hacienda Court Yard to enter this old world decadent restaurant! (Still 1st class)   \"So what's the problem\" you ask?   Well when you enter this restaurant with a reservation, a snooty hostess will guide to their rather cramped bar to wait for 1 - 1  1/2 hrs. to get your table!(OK it's a popular high end place, & you can practice your art of conversation over the loud volume of many other patrons waiting the same lousy treatment from the hostess....) Oh this is when sticker shock is about to hit you $30-$35 for a beer (a Guinness) & a glass of wine!   You finally get seated & the waiting staff is doing one hell of a job trying to sell you an expensive bottle of wine! (This part of the experience is very similar to buying Time Share!)  So you order another glass of wine & beer which makes you seem like a cheapskate, or get treated as such.   Now the food does taste good, but with rather small portions & rather hefty sticker, it makes you masticate every bite & really taste your dish! But how much am I paying for this dish!  It's only half a cut of the fish!  Despite all the mastication, it is very hard to swallow!  Somehow you finish your dish! (Mom would be so proud of you cause' your plate is as clean as if it came out of the dish washer!)   So you are now ready for the big finally & the waiters \"Fave Pick\" on desert! Well off course there are two scrumdiddlyumptious recommends that you will have with the two tiniest espresso shots!  So your bill for $240+ makes its way to the table, & boy if you're planning tipping only 15% you will get the \"you cheapskate evil eye\" walking out of this restaurant!   Oh 'yah' don't forget to tip the valet, $5 tip also will get you a \"are you kidin' me look as well!\"",

My wife picked it as a romantic spot for her birthday, and it didn't disappoint.   This place is awesome. You drive in, the palm-lined circular driveway instantly transports you elsewhere. The valet takes your car, and you pass through passageways of intricate lighting patterns. Warmly welcomed into the dining room, which is surrounded in brick, long drapes, and exposed beams to give a classy but comfortable feel. The chairs have nice comfortable cushions for a long stay.   Waitstaff were all friendly and as fast or laid back as you want them to be.   One thing that I really note is the bread course. Is the bread hot or cold? How is it served? Here, a small loaf of Italian bread with the signature dustings of flour, signifying an \"artisan\" bread, was served with a small bowl of fresh pesto sauce. The bread was hot, the crust crispy, the sauce deelish. It was a good omen.   The food was all first-rate. While I had a vegetarian string: yummy Quorn empenadas, pear salad, and the delicately fried stuffed squash blossoms, my wife had the escargots napoleon (she loved it), the lobster bisque (which I tried--great flavor), and the Meditteranean Lamb. I also had a side dish of potato puree--creamy garlicky heaven!   It is an expensive place, but I would say it is worthwhile, and definitely good for a special night. The food was delicious and servings reasonable: if you get all the courses, you can actually take some home! The dessert menu was quite extensive, too. I think enough to please everyone. I definitely would go back sometime--just make sure you have money in the bank, know what I mean?",

It was gorgeous, 60s in Jan...gotta love Arizona winters.  We ordered the clam chowder (soup of the day), and it was creamy and flavorful.  I would have enjoyed more clams, but it was good.  The bread is served with a house made pesto sauce.  Pretty good, especially since the bread comes out hot.  For entrees, we ordered the Carbonara and Paella.  The Paella for $32 was a very good size.  The shellfish in the dish was delicious, tasted super fresh, almost like right out of the ocean.  The pasta dish was a bit stingy in portion (eat lots of bread if that's the only thing you're ordering...mmm...more carbs.), but the sauce was rich and yummy.   I guess that is was the chef made when he was on Iron Chef.    Overall, great ambiance, beautiful resort and decent food.",

Their colonial Spanish architecture with a Mediterranean flair is both elegant and romantic.  The Resort and Restaurant are both decorated with hardwoods and cherry woods everywhere with and hand-painted Italian frescoes and beautiful floral arrangements throughout.  The unfortunate thing about my visit, I was there for a business dinner... lol  The service from start to finish was outstanding.  The bar was fairly busy mixed with Resort guest and people like us just their to dine.  The servers were very attentive and we got our food fairly fast considering the type of restaurant.  The Sommelier was knowledgeable and eager to help us find the right wines to go with our meals. Excellent service all around.  I started my dinning experience with a glass of Chardonnay and Pear and organic mixed green salad.  It was good but I was expecting the pear to be grilled.  For the entree I had a wonderful Cabernet Sauvignon recommended by the Sommelier, to go with my New York Strip. I added a side of roasted brussel sprouts with duck confit which was outstanding!  My steak was cooked extremely well and delicious.  I did not have room for desert, but made room for a cup of coffee, which was very good as well.   My next visit to T. Cooks I plan to bring my lovely bride and have the pan roasted halibut with herb potatoes and local veggies cooked in a red wine butter sauce, YUM!!  It looked really good from across the table : )  I recommend T. Cooks the next time you are planning a nice dinner for two or with some good friends wanting to have a great evening together.  Their wine selection is good and they have an Oktoberfest menu for you German Food fanatics.",

I had a mushroom soup that I couldn't finish - it was way to intense.  Also had a monkfish wrapped with bacon which is normally a great combo but I'm not sure what oil they fry with or what amount they used, the dish was over powered and the freshness of the ingredients were lost.",

For $33 you can get their buffet brunch which includes the better than usual goodies: omelet station, crab legs, already peeled shrimp, lox, fresh fruit, warm breads, various salads, waffles, grilled veggies and a dessert bar.    Now to mix it up, they also offer delicious items off their menu.  These dishes range from $10 - $15 a plate, but are fantastic and large.    However, if you want to then add the brunch buffet to your menu selection, you can pay an additional $23.  So, in essence, you can get the $10 pancakes and the $23 buffet, and pay the same price as getting the stand alone buffet.    I got the banana-pecan French toast off the menu.  OMG, it was perfect - especially with the warm \"real\" maple syrup.    Service there is great and very attention driven.  Even my napkin would be neatly folded by the time I returned to my seat.  We came for a birthday and they had inscribed a nice note on top of the piece of dessert.  A very nice touch.  I also love the ambiance and the grounds of the Royal Palms property.  It's gorgeous there.",

But, after my visit tonight I can say that the bar is just as good and a great economic option when you want T Cooks but without the dining room experience. With live music in the background and a fire warming up the setting, it was a nice atmosphere along with good food! Plus, I love that the Royal Palms hosts events like a live music artist who creates art based on the music playing.",

    "text": "I have dined here multiple times since Chef Paul McCabe has been heading up the kitchen.  It is consistently fabulous and exciting cuisine. The  major complaints I have about the dining scene in Phoenix/Scottsdale is consistency and innovation.  This is NOT the case at T Cooks, it is definitely bringing exciting things to the Phoenix!  Every meal, and every aspect of the dining experience has been stellar each time I have been.  The food is exciting, inspired and executed perfectly each time.  The octopus is the best preparation I have ever had.  The venison tartare and sea bass crudo are some of my favorites as well.  I can never resist ordering the antelope either.  This menu is stacked with some winners for sure!  The Service is first class as well.  You can tell the staff is informed, and an excited part of a culinary team.  They truly are top notch, without being stuffy. This is new T Cook's is so much improved from the former version - you can't even compare the two.  Still beautiful and classy, but now with innovative 5 star cuisine as well. If you are lucky enough to be able to dine at T Cooks on Wednesday they offer a True culinary adventure called #PM31. Definitely call ahead to make reservations - there are limited seats available. We were fortunate enough to enjoy it last night.  It is a world class experience.  It is a 12 or so course tasting menu based around the chef's inspiration and passion.  It's always changing.  This was one of the most special and FABULOUS dining experiences I have ever had.  It was truly a special experience and orchestrated to perfection.  It was exciting, innovative, playful, and as I said before, inspired .  And most importantly each course delivered!!!!  This is an experience NOT to be missed.  I will attach some photos.  Whether it be just going out to dinner or another adventure from #PM31 - I can't wait to visit T cooks again and see what they have in store.",

    "text": "I am very disappointed with my recent visit to T. Cook's. I took my girlfriend there because I had a fabulous experience at this place 12 years back. I remembered the charm of the place, the piano bar, the fire that warmed the place up in the winter, great food and fabulous service. I told my girlfriend what a fabulous experience she was going to have until she became tired of hearing me.  I used a Groupon-type voucher for the Mixup bar for 2 cocktails and 2 appetizers and then it said I could also use it to get $25 credit for T.Cook's dinner. The service was terrible. The bar was right next to where we sat but it took a long time to get a drink. The waitress did not appear friendly at all. I wanted to tell her that even if I was using a voucher I would give her the tip for the actual $$ spent but my girlfriend said in a classy place like Royal Palms you should get top service even if you were a spendthrift. I noticed around that the other tables had empty plates and glasses left in them and not cleaned up. The bar did not seem classy at all. Having read Yelp reviews I ordered the duck and the lobster rolls but apparently they were out of the duck. The lobster rolls were amazingly good. Disappointed with the lackluster service we proceeded to dinner and it went downhill from there. Again, extremely poor service. We would have a drink empty and wait and have no waiter show up. We split a house salad and it was amazingly crispy and good. We then proceeded to order the food and I had the lamb and she had the New York strip steak. Words cannot describe just how wonderful the lamb and the steak were. INCREDIBLE! But the service was so horrible that I asked the waiter to call the manager. The manager took 15 minutes to arrive! He was very nice and assured us that our service would improve but it did not. At the end of the meal the manager tried to make up for lackluster service by getting us 2 desserts but my girlfriend had enough and she wanted to leave. I tried to use the voucher for $25 credit and the waiter said it did not apply! I pointed out to him that the voucher said $25 credit toward T. Cook's meal and again the manager had to intervene to get the $25 off.  Also, the crowd here was retirees and snowbirds who had not left before summer and the atmosphere was anything other than vibrant. Like I said the food was amazingly good but the service was very poor. I will never visit this place again. There are a lot of great alternatives in the Phoenix area for fine restaurants.",

    "text": "\"Would you prefer to dine indoors or outdoors today?\"   Answering \"Outdoors,thank you\" was our second good decision of the day to that point.  The first was choosing T. Cook's for lunch.    Located in the Royal Palms Hotel, which is understated and wonderful (no need to scream \"FIRST CLASS\" when it is best communicated in whisper as is here) our experience at T. Cook's was what we expected it to be - lovely.  From the garden setting to the table settings to the top notch service and delicious food, each piece provided just the right fit in the puzzle.     We were fortunate to get in given we did not have reservations and arrived just at the tail end of what was the lunch rush.  Yet the server was as attentive as if she had been waiting only for us all afternoon.    While dinner can be very spendy, lunch at T. Cook's  gives you a chance to soak up the experience and enjoy the food at a reasonable price.  We recommend ordering from the combo optionsmenu at lunch providing an opportunity to sample a selection of wonderful soups, salads, sandwiches in \"soup and...\" or \"salad and...\", -you get the idea - for only $14.00.   Plus the lunch dessert menu offers a sampling of three items for about $8 that we found the perfect sweet ending to be shared by two along with coffee.    With so many restaurants to try and so little time and as infrequently as we get to the Phoenix area, we're not sure this will be a repeat spot for us, but we are so glad to have experienced T Cook's.  Based on glowing reviews of food savvy friends who loved T. Cook's when they lived in Scottsdale for a few months, we were somewhat prepared to have our very high expectations not met...but our expectations were met and then some.   Go!",

The chef, Lee Hillson, is very talented.  He has been a contestant on Iron Chef America and really turns out a great product.  His fresh spin on the classic dishes are delicious.  I was here in April for a multi-course meal as part of the Scottsdale Culinary Festival.  Chef Hillson pulled out all the stops and in particular his lamb course was fantastic.  Yesterday I stopped in for lunch with one of my clients.  We had the Fruit de Mar which was a fried calamari, shrimp, scallop dish.  The seafood was good but the breading was a little much for my taste.  I had the Turkey club sandwich which was very good.  Heaped high with thinly sliced roasted turkey there was enough to take home for leftovers.  This is such a nice place.  I always enjoy dining at T-Cook's.",

    "text": "If this is one of the hallmarks of fine dining in Phoenix, I feel sorry for your city.  We were in Phoenix for a weekend to enjoy what the city has to offer. Apparently, not much!  Yes, this place is pretty, classy, rich, etc etc.... what it lacks is good food and a decent crowd. If your idea of a date night is eating below mediocre food while being sneered by ignorant old people, this is the place for you. I prefer some place where I do not have to worry about such things.  The menu is quite disturbing - a lot of sea food and no game (isn't this a high end restaurant?). It makes me uncomfortable to eat sea food in land locked places like Phoenix (and all of midwest), it just ain't right. Anyway, that's my issue, not a judge of the quality of food at any restaurant... moving on...  The food: partner's duck is probably the worst duck I've ever tasted. His salad was laughable - spring greens and pears. Really? I ordered escargot - the snails were already shelled and served with mushroom ravioli and watercress salad. Passable at best. My lamb was quite bland and flavorless. Lamb is one of the, if not the most, tastiest red meats. I am (un)impressed that the chef made lamb taste flavorless. Unforgivable.   You know it is bad when the saving grace of a meal is the wine. The Sancerre saved the evening. Yes, there was dessert. Something dark chocolatey. It was so unmemorable that I don't even remember what I ate for dessert.  Let's get to the crowd: wtf is wrong with you people in Phoenix?  Have you never seen an impeccably dressed interracial gay couple before? We got the stares everywhere we went, not just at this restaurant. Granted the restaurant set up a table with rose petals and gave us menus with the words \"happy anniversary\" printed on them, but I would trade all that for decent food and a nicer crowd. The kicker is that our meal cost over $300 including wine and tip. I almost never quote prices at restaurants, but T.Cook's below mediocre food needs to be upgraded to abominable when you consider the price range.  I wanted to give T. Cook's one star, but then I remembered their Mediterranean benedict we ordered for room service breakfast. That alone deserves an additional star. A very well made item. Capers, chives, petite diced tomatoes on eggs benedict added a great flavor. It was so good I ordered it three mornings in a row (yes, we stayed at the Royal Palms for the weekend).  Thanks for ruining our anniversary weekend, T. Cook's. I am now taking the man to Key West and Koln to make up for the damage you have done.",

When our server introduced us by saying the chef was on the iron chef program - I knew right then we were going to have a less then adequate meal.....  When there was a plethora of shellfish and no game on the menu I knew we were going to have a less then adequate meal (this is ARIZONA in the winter y'all!) Escargot - really? in Arizona?  Though menu items usually have spare descriptions I am used to elegant presentations with many components (a la Iruna). Especially all the \"hype\" around T.Cooks - alas my salad was mixed greens and sliced pears - yes mixed greens and sliced pears - made me giggle (then I remembered this was phoenix).  So ordering the duck breast - I was thinking this will be okay - sigh - why was my duck breast rubbery? I am guessing after they seared the breast the chef/cook sliced it too fast neglecting to wait the minute for the meat to rest - forcing my duck breast to be inedible...  Then I looked around the room (gasp) white haired old people abound - these folks are from Phoenix - ha! They are having a grand ol time - ok I won't dog them but how about the mousy haired frumpy chick next to us with the beaded top  Dessert - we may have had dessert - I think we did - it was that memorable.

    "text": "Whisk your date away into old colonial Spain, where Mediterranean breezes and flavors waft into your nostrils.  The mood is set with dim lighting, siena and sunburnt vaulted ceilings, cozy fireplaces, and an elegant ambiance.  Start your evening off in the lounge, with its posh leather couches, mahogany bar, antique lamps, and baby grand piano to set the mood.  The menu of specialty cocktails will make any discerning carouser dance with delight.  From the \"Sweetheart\" with chambord vodka, champagne, and chambord - to the \"Rose Petal Infusion\" with grey goose, strawberries, st. germaine elderflower, and a rose petal, your lovely lady will be swooning with ardour, or from the strong martinis.  The mixologists here know their libations.  Drinks are poured with the finest spirits and crafted with love, and you pay accordingly for an average of $14.  However, do not let this dampen your spirits as Happy Hour is from 5p-7p, and reverse Happy Hour from 10p-midnight Sunday through Thursday.  Appetizers are half price, featured drinks and wines by the glass for $6.  So after your palate has been readied for the culinary splendour that is about to meet your lips, try one of the lounge's appetizers or wait until you are seated in the restaurant to be impressed.  The lounge has an eclectic menu which features \"Fruit De Mar\" (tempura fried calamari, shrimp, and scallops), the very popular Belgian snack of \"Mussels and Frites\" (mussels dish served with a side of french fries), \"Adana Kebabs\" served with pita and yogurt, and even an American favorite, the short rib sandwhich.  Average price is $12.  Want to impress your date? Order the Chilled shellfish and bubbles entree right at the bar, as the piano man croons in the background.  This delectable entree comes with maine lobster, king crab legs, jumbo shrimp, and oysters on the half shell, and is served with two glasses of house champagne, for a mere $55.  Now if that isn't the perfect aphrodisiac...  If dining solely in the restaurant, you will not be disappointed by the first class service, attention to detail, and the fine food that is so lovingly prepared by its chef.  The meals are split up into courses, and I strongly suggest you do all three to fully explore the tempting Mediterranean treats that this restaurant has to offer.  Start off with the \"Burgundian Escargot\" (with mushroom raviolis, roasted beets, watercress salad, and vegetable beurre rouge) or the phenomenal \"Crab Cakes'\" (with house-made chorizo, clams, and roasted clam puree).  Not in the mood for seafood, but still enjoy good belly timber?  Then try the duet of roasted bonemarrow and sauteed sweetbreads served with their housemade brioche and a horseradish infused orange marmelade.  Now you are ready to clear your palate for your main course, something light to pique those tastebuds...the \"lobster fennel bisque,\" or the unbelievably ambrosial \"Pear Salad\" with its gorgeous blending of spiced pecans and blue cheese on organic greens.  If you are a devotee to food, then you have saved room for the main course.  Choose from Chef Lee's Carbonara, (my personal favorite) with garlic cream, pancetta, prosciutto, and egg yolk.  For Spanish fare, there is T. Cook's signature Paella, straight from the fireplace, or a sinful slow roasted lamb stuffed with feta.  Many more seafoods and steaks grace this menu, for an average cost of $32.  You will definitely expect to pay accordingly for the quality, flavor, and love that is put into these amazing dishes.  A dining experience fit for the gods, sure to impress your date, and your palate.",

    "text": "Its hard not to love the Royal Palms setting, the gorgeous Mediteranean grounds, and the elegance of an evening at T. Cooks.  We typically come a bit early for our reservation and walk the grounds to enjoy the texture of it all.   It feels special to be there, and over the four times we've been, its pretty much lived up to or exceeded expectation three times.    The last time we went however, was a rather surprising contrast to what we had come to expect.  Having been used to exquisite and thoughtful service, as well as wonderfully prepared and presented food, we were not prepared for an evening of disappointment.  Despite a dining room that was perhaps half-full when we were seated, the amount of time we waited to give our order, as well as the time between courses, seemed almost geologic.  When entrees arrived, one was wrong and another had portions that were cold (not luke warm ... actually cold).  We waited again hoping to ask for remedies, but we didn't see a member of the wait staff again for quite a while.   Now, that said, when we did finally get the chance to raise our concerns, the dishes were quickly re-prepared and returned ... and the staff comp'd our bottle of wine for the evening and brought an incredible mulit-chocolate dessert huge enough for three to share with leftovers.  So, although I was disappointed in the evening, I applaud T. Cooks efforts at repair.  And I will definitely return; one off-night isn't enough to dissuade me.  And that lobster bisque ... incredible.",

The restaurant is nicely furnished and provides a most comfortable feeling - while not \"over the top\" special. We had dinner with another couple. Ron had the corn soup which he rated as a \"real winner\". My beet salad was both attractive and tasty  Three of us had the sea bass - perfectly prepared in a European sized serving. One had the strip steak - lively but a very ample portion. If you go for the steak either come very hungry or plan to eat the remainder another day  The finish equals dinner - deserts are not an after thought.  I recall eight choices plus coffees and a range of ports and other after dinner drinks.  In all - a lovely venue for a special evening",

Excellent  texture contrast and just the right amount of acidity.  The rest of the food was good. The pulpo was a bit rubbery, though. The chicken entree was filling. The chicken was moist and the jus was well flavored.  My dining mate got a fig drink- it was very smooth. It's a good choice!   Go for the ambiance and enjoy some drinks and appetizers.",

The new format is this:  you order a starter and an entree and you also get access to a limited buffet.  By limited I mean you won't find the omelet station, the paella station, the salad bar, or the huge dessert area.  What you will find are shellfish, bread baskets, fruit, salads, and a small dessert area (which is plenty).  The starters and entrees are great.  I'd skip the pupusa and go with the scallops next time but other than that, there isn't much I would change.   The price is fair and the live music is a nice touch.  If you have friends or family from out of town to entertain, stop by here on the weekend for brunch (it's Saturday's as well now).",

We found a table that had a love seat and two oversized chairs and the arrangement was simply perfect for our brunch date.  We ordered a bottle of bubbly and began indulging in the buffet of foods from fresh salads, seafood and Paella, to cooked to order omelettes, pancakes and crepes.  The architecture of the resort itself was alluring and kept us there a bit after we finished eating. We walked the grounds and admired the courtyard until the rain had us back inside, were we enjoyed a French 75 before departing back to the hotel.  A memorable, \" we must go back\" 4 star review for you, T Cook's.",

Our menu was set as we were a group of 30-or more, that included the Garden Vegetable Salad, Corn fed Filet Mignon, handmade Forest Mushroom Lasagna and a Sherry Braised Mary's half chicken. and for Dessert, we all had Creme Brulee.  Let me start by saying that Service at the event was exceptional, the servers were on top of things and we were well taken care of.  Salad came out, and it was tasty, nothing over the top but and lacked a little bit more haloumi cheese. The creme brulee was good a swell, and i liked the small cookie surprise with some citric fruit (i think it was mandarin) on the side of the plate.   As for my main dish, I ordered the mushroom lasagna and this dish looked a little strange at first, definitely not your typical lasagna. Layers of dough not in an orderly fashion put on top of one another and the whole dish had loads of different types of mushroom. It probably was 3-5 different mushroom flavors that hit my palate. It was filling, tasty and out of this world. the little spinach bed under the dish was great as well.   Overall, the experience and service get top points, The Lasagna gets top points as well, desert and salad were great sating but nothing exceptional or surprising.   Would like to come back here again and eat at the main restaurant and try other things.",

The smoked salmon may have been smoked in house. Not sure but the back end flavor of the salmon has a very harsh smoke to it. My wife had the avacado toast and enjoyed it. The coffee is low budget thin and anaemic. Pass if you enjoy a real cup of coffee. Overall only go if the food is secondary and you couldn't care less about money.",

    "text": "General comment: unorganized, poor service, lack of commitment to the guest experience which is unacceptable for a luxury establishment.  I made a reservation for Mother's Day on OpenTable. I knew from experience that Royal Palms offers a Mother's Day brunch buffet, so, after making the reservation, I called the restaurant three different times to try to ensure we were set up with the special MD buffet. I was never able to reach anyone, and finally left a voicemail at the restaurant's direct line confirming my request. On the day of our reservation, we showed up, with our one-year-old daughter, only to find out that we were NOT signed up for the MD buffet. We ordered in the main dining area and our food took over an hour to arrive with a non-existent waiter assigned to our table; meanwhile, we had nearly maximized the time our daughter can stay still in a restaurant. When I was able to track down our waiter (literally, finding him in the back room), I asked him several times for the status of our order, each time he told me he would check, and only the last time did he actually follow up and tell me \"we're really busy it should be soon\" - which is unacceptable when we showed up on time for our reservation. Our food finally arrived, and it was good, but we had no time to enjoy it. The waiter comp'd our meal, which was a good gesture, but all I wanted was a nice Mother's Day brunch with my family. Very disappointed. This experience tells me Royal Palms is getting too comfortable.",

We wandered over from the spa at around noon and were seated immediately on their gorgeous shaded patio. With the Mediterranean decor and heaps of flowers in bloom, you'd never know we were in the middle of the desert. I started with a glass of their delicious red sangria, and the pour was VERY generous. I loved the veggies that came with the roasted garlic hummus, the watermelon radish, and the presentation was beautiful! We also split a salad that had huge globs of fresh burrata - heaven! The Spanish octopus was prepared well, though you basically get one giant tentacle perched on a blistered pepper. It was good, but definitely doesn't hold a candle to the octopus dish at Virtu and Nico. The paella was probably my least favorite because it was a little on the salty side, but the rice was cooked well and they were generous with the seafood. For dessert we shared the amaretto cake, which was absolute perfection. The portion sizes were perfect for us, especially as we were sharing a few things, but I think those with appetites might still find themselves a little hungry. Service and ambiance were top notch - we'll definitely be back next spa day!",

While the prices for here at resort level, you can get away with some credit towards breakfast as a Globalist Hyatt member.  The breakfast has a good selection of some savory and sweet items.  The plus here is everything is a la carte and freshly made, even some condiments like their jam.   We came late for breakfast one day and it became the timing for the weekend brunch.  We are glad we missed out on breakfast because the brunch was phenomenal.  For $60 per person, you can get 1 starter, 1 main dish, 1 mimosa, savory buffet, and dessert buffet.  Let me tell you, the savory buffet has some great items like crab and shrimp.  If you are a seafood fan, you will get more than your money's worth.",

    "text": "**I had initially given a 4 star review and I thought the experience was good, then I got my credit card bill and realized for this type of place the experience should have been exceptional (hence the update to 3 stars), I also spoke with a friend that had recommended this place in the past (he loves it) and I realized our dinner was nothing like the visits he had described**  Very nice and quaint location. They close after lunch and open at 5:30 for dinner. Ken was our server, him and Miguel took good care of us. We went with a couple of friends to celebrate a birthday and had a lively conversation, but I think the meals took a long time to arrive. Our reservation was at 6pm, and our main dishes arrived around 7pm (a little past, I think) We ordered 2 appetizers, but I think the complimentary focaccia bread and pesto would have been enough. I did like it better than the humus we ordered. The nice touch about the humus is that it comes with slices of cucumber, radish (big white radish, not sure what is the name), and carrots, great for those with gluten intolerance or trying to keep carbs low. I had the ribeye, no sides. I ordered it rare and the first time it was way over cooked. I brought it to the attention of our server and he immediately took it back to get me one cooked to my liking. The second one was perfect, but it took a little too long. Most of our table was done with dinner by the time I got mine (around 7:25pm).  About that, I think that when your food order is not correct they should not take it back while they get the new one (unless, of course, it was undercooked and they need to take it to cook it longer)... it is super awkward to stay at the table with nothing to eat, well, it may be more awkward for those that did get their food... what are your thoughts on that topic?  We had a variety of desserts, hubby ordered the bread pudding and loved it! I just tasted it and it was very good.",

The service is both friendly and efficient and it's a great setting to have a business or personal discussion (in other words, not too loud). I've ordered a few things from their breakfast menu and have always been pleased. The portions are generous and the ingredients seem fresh. Most recently, I ordered the egg-white dish with spinach and feta. It was a bit heavy on the feta but to each his own, I didn't have to eat what I didn't want. They also put some complimentary muffins on the table which is a nice touch.  The reason that I give four stars is because it is just too expensive. I get that it's resort season in Phoenix and if it was my restaurant, I might be charging the same. $5 for a cup of drip coffee is ridiculous. My colleague and I had two cups of coffee, an egg white frittata, and plain yogurt with berries - $45. Really?",

In my opinion the price is reasonable for the superb food you get. the seafood at the buffet had big pieces of shrimp, and crab claws. they make it easy to eat the crab claws too. they also had cheese and meat options, a few salads, and fruit/desserts. For entree we tried the short ribs, salmon, and breakfast omelette, all were great. no complaints with food or service. our waiter was \"T\", he was attentative and chearful. Drinks, we had \"build your own memosa\" and coffee. I saw other people around us get the bloody Mary and I must say it came with too much garnish, almost looked like a meal of its own, but I did not taste it so I can only comment on how it looked. overall, I would come back again. if you are in the area or staying at the Royal palms resort, you must dine here.",

    "text": "Not the T Cooks we use to know and love. I decided to take the family and two friends to T Cooks for the Thanksgiving Day brunch and it was a monumental disappointment! We've attended their normal Sunday brunch on several occasions and it has always been good, but for some reason, on this day, they really dropped the ball.    We were seated on the patio and at the time of the reservation we were assured that if it rained they would be adequately prepared to accommodate us with indoor seating. Well, when it began to rain, they were not prepared, and in fact we were kind of ignored, even when we tracked down our server. Now see, the having to track down your server at The Royal Palms shouldn't even be in the same sentence, right?! Anyway, we dealt with the rain, it didn't last too long but the food in our plate was no longer edible after it had been substantially rained on. Ok, it's buffet so we can get more but that's hardly the point. In general our server seemed stressed, possibly overwhelmed (trying to give the benefit of the doubt) and as a result was not very attentive. We received cold coffee, lack of replacement silverware, etc...   The buffet itself was very average with the exception of the crepe, waffle and omelet station; they were delicious. The mushroom soup was cold and sub par, the Caprese salad, stuffing and sweet potatoes flavorless, as were many other items.  I have been in the service industry for almost 12 years, so it's not my style to complain but it was embarrassing especially because our guests know we frequent this establishment and couldn't help but ask \"Why?\" Oh, one more thing, on a side note: They add 18% gratuity to all checks regardless of the size of the party, and normally we would tip at least 20%. My guests found the automatic gratuity insulting for such an establishment...I would have to agree! I wanted to give 1 star but I'm giving 2 stars only because of the atmosphere of the resort.  .",

The green salad was a bit wilted.  I am sure it would have been refreshed if we waited, but there was enough other food that we did not miss the green salad. The guest of honor selected the crab omelette with homemade hash browns, which she said was delicious. The portion was large enough for her to take some home.

    "text": "Surprise! Surprise!    After reading a March, 2014 review by a food critic with The Arizona Republic, a group of us wondered what to expect from T.Cook's.  Although reservations were a breeze and a group of 10 friends were able to secure a round table on a Sunday night, we still had some trepidation.  The critic bemoaned the service, the surroundings, the decor, and most of the menu noting that a change in chefs was apparently unfortunate.  Upon arrival, we were seated immediately, and promptly attended to by a trio of wait staff under the guidance of head waiter Michael Fitzgerald.  Cocktails were reasonably priced, appetizers were thoroughly addressed, and the menu questions were expertly handled.  Most began their meal choosing from a wonderful array of salads that were tasty, fresh, and pleasing to the palate.  Each of us had something quite different for our entree's ranging from the fresh trout, an antelope loin, lamb chops, and the more traditional steaks and short ribs.  Everything was flawless, and not even the mildest form of muttering was detected. Dessert was offered, but honestly everyone was very satisfied by that point and we decided to pass.  Imagine most restaurants when a table of 10 asks for separate checks.  And, a few in our group used their Preferred Diners cards as well.  Most waiters would balk at this mathematical challenge, but Michael came through with not only individual bills, but a smile.  He also reminded us that a 20% gratuity had already been figured in stating that he was very comfortable with that and there was no real need to go over and above that percentage.  How nice!  The critic may have been correct the evening he was there - and perhaps served a \"wake-up\" call to the entire operation.  If so, it worked. We all plan to return soon, and this time dine al fresco on their wonderful patio.  So, here's to T.Cook's and their service, their decor and their menu.  And, here's to Michael Fitzgerald as their ambassador for presenting this delightful restaurant in so many positive ways.",

I know last year it was recently remodeled and I'm not too much of a fan of the new Decor. Sometimes I feel somethings are best left alone. I understand that menus change and brunch items are seasonal and cannot always be there however I cannot help but think that lately the brunch has been a little bit skimpy. The omelette and waffle bar are back those were previously removed a few months ago but there are still other items that are gone on the menu- lemon ricotta pancakes are no longer on the menu -you can ask for them but they're technically only served before 10am. I feel like the recipe might have changed on them  as well ,as they are a little bit more fluffy and less dense with ricotta cheese than they used to be. The price of the buffet has jumped up to $49 per person which isn't too bad however the menu items don't justify the price we can all buy eggs sausage pancakes and waffles. I don't mind paying more if the quality was there but it was not- the pastries were passable and looked like the kind you buy them bulk at Costco -At least throw in a free Mamosa and then I would've felt I was getting my moneys worth. I will always come back to this spot ---but maybe its time to try some new spots in Phoenix. perhaps places that are less so obviously skimpy",

They have this amazing $50 tortellini deal Me: $50 for tortellini? That is so not a deal!  I later found out that the tortellini is stuffed with lobster AND the $50 includes an appetizer and dessert...so I guess it is a deal!    Jared and Gabi apparently come here often because they knew all the bartenders by name. We made ourselves at home at the bar and got ready for my 20th meal in Phoenix...and I had only been in town for 2 days at this point.  And this would be why I went on weightwatchers the second I returned to chicago.  While I was tempted to try this \"tortellini deal\" I decided to go with the scallops instead, which came with shrimp mac and cheese. Shrimp! Mac & cheese! My 2 favorites...lovely combo!! No appetizer for me, but I did a pretty good job of eating the loaf of bread they put in front of us.   Jared was nice enough to share a bite of his crabcake with me...delicious!  I ate up all my mac & cheese first (of course) and then it was time for the scallops.  By this point I was pretty full, but they were too good not to eat so managed to eat 2 of the 3 perfectly cooked scallops.  And then I also managed to make room for creme brulee cheesecake for dessert...mmmmm. This is so worth breaking any diet for.  All this delicious food while enjoying the lovely tunes coming from the piano next to the bar.  I can see why Gabi and Jared are regulars!",

The service was impeccable and the decorum was chic as well as relaxing.  While all was spot on, the desserts were the crowning achievement.   We had the chocolate banana caramel mousse as well as a waiter special, dark chocolate peanut butter bars.  I don't make this statement lightly....the dessert was the finest I've ever had.",

It severely detracts from the otherwise delightful atmosphere.  This lounge is full of potential interaction, climate, people, and possibility. The presence of a television, in this lounge, is obtuse and utterly distasteful.  The presence of a television nearly ruins the otherwise perfect environment.  It's been nearly a decade long mistake I am still waiting to be rectified.",

We sat outside on the patio, looking out at the courtyard.  - Generous charcuterie platter - Lobster bisque was a revelation - Venison tartare was a bit underseasoned, but it was good - Beef tenderloin was cooked well, but not exactly memorable - Black cod was the best dish I've had in a while. It was served on a mix of fresh shucked corn kernels and lovely little clams.  Great romantic dinner spot. Would definitely come here again.",

    "text": "My Boo has been telling me about this place ever since we relocated to Phoenix a year ago.  He said he remembered it being very nice & special so we decided to celebrate our anniversary here.    One of the frustrating things about this place is not being able to talk to a live person when calling in but leaving messages.  We did make our reservation on line but the day of we were running about 15 minutes late, I tried calling but got voice mail.  When we walked up to the hostess stand & I explained \"I'm sorry we tried to call\"  the hostess said absolutely nothing to us, no \"Good evening\" or \"that's OK\" or \"Would you like to sit outside\" NOTHING!  She told the other lady at the desk where to sit us but there were plenty of tables & we requested the tables against the window with nice high back wing chairs. I did mention it would have been nice to be acknowledged & later that hostess came to our table & handed me a long stem rose & apologized.  We waited & waited & waited & finally asked a waiter that walked by \"Can we get a drink?\"  We had been there 25 minutes BEFORE a waiter came to our table!  We ordered drinks & an appetizer of mussels. We got the mussels before we got the drinks!  That is so BAD.  Finally the mussels came & they were delicious!  Some of the best we've had.  They are big & juicy in a very tasty broth which is seasoned w/lamb chorizo!   Served with yummy thinly sliced grilled sourdough.  Next we had salads, we had the burrata & Kale Caesar,  again, really tasty and refreshing.  My entree choice was the rack of Lamb & Boo ordered the Branzino!  Both were really good.  My Lamb was a bit rarer than I prefer but I decided to take half home & savor the next day a bit more cooked.  The bus boy was the most attentive of our servers & boxed up my Lamb.  When he brought my To-Go bag he said \"I added some extra bread & pesto sauce\".  Great!  The Pesto is light & bright and the herbaceous Focaccia was so tasty.  I put the bag next to my chair.  For dessert Boo ordered the orange chocolate dessert.  I had a bite & it was very good.  At this time our waiter also told us our cocktails were on him since we had to wait so long for service. Ok, good idea & timely since we were getting ready to pay.  I excused myself to the ladies room & when I returned noticed our to-go bag was gone!  WHAT!!  Turns out the guy seated at the table next to us had taken our bag.  What's crazy is I had heard them take part of their dinner home as well so they left w/two bags.    We were frustrated!  What was a celebratory dinner for us turned out to be a crazy evening.  The hostess came up to us as we were leaving & said as much.  She said \"we (T Cooks) need to make this up to you.  I said \"How?\"  She said she would tell the manager & we'd being here from someone.  We never did hear from anyone.  To sum it up. Front of the house is sub par but the back of the house cooks a fantastic meal!",

We decided to do just breakfast and NOT brunch buffet Bc we do no eat a lot. Didn't feel like it was worth paying for brunch with the kids. For sure will do brunch just the 2 of us in the near future.   The food was amazing. Husband had the flat iron steak, potatoes and eggs. It came with bacon as well which was phenomenal! I had the corned beef hash and eggs. Wish it had a tiny bit more beef...but that's just me. I love my meat. Our older daughter has eggs, bacon and potatoes which she enjoyed also. And our little one has pancakes that she finished which usually doesn't happen...so I guess that was bomb dot com as well.   Service was wonderful! I wish I remembered our waiters name. Front greeter could have been a tad bit more on the polite side. Felt kind of rushed and she wasn't as pleasant. Maybe too early. But leaving, she asked if we enjoyed out meal and she was more nicer.  Maybe she has coffee by then. Lol   We stayed and explored the hotel a bit. BEAUTIFUL!!!! Love the history, love the fountains, love everything!",

Started with an asparagus tart, Wagyu Beef Filet and ended with a fresh peach tart dessert. The Wagyu Filet was my favorite item: consisted of roasted garlic chopped on top served with mashed potato and roasted carrot. The service was excellent as well. The server didn't bat an eye at us for using the living social deal which can sometimes be uncomfortable when presenting it. There's also live music in the bar area from 7-10pm.",

The service day 1 was fabulous, day 2 was ok. Most importantly the food- top notch options. Granted I typically wouldn't pay $14 for a piece of toast with avocado but I was all about trying as much as I could. My favorite was the Mediterranean Eggs Benedict, I'd say it was the best option on the breakfast menu and absolutely scrumptious!  The fresh squeezed juices were also delightful and a good non caffeinated or alcoholic option.  The decor was beautiful and service was quick. If you're ever in the area, check it out. I've heard great things about their dinner options as well!",

After monsoon rain, the flies and mosquitoes are rampant which makes outside seating pretty impossible. I sat inside for most of the meals where occasional mosquitoes and flies will still do a fly by.   BETTER DISHES: sea bass tacos - fresh fish. Best to ask for some salsa to put on these tacos for extra flavor.   Corn chowder - creamy but not heavy. A cup is the perfect size.   Hummus with flatbread- great starter for sharing. The garlic inside the hummus gives an extra kick. Served with Warm toasted pita bread.   SKIP: farmhouse omelette- typical. Large portion. So so.   Tomato and burrata with greens - the greens were ok. A bit too much burrata for this dish.",

    "text": "We ate at T Cooks as part of a Royal Palms staycation package. We had both breakfast and dinner.   The interior is really beautiful in the mission style with dark woods, iron chandeliers, earth tones, but contemporary vibes from the sleek wine fridge and tile work. We were seated in the middle of the dining room. For better views, request a table at the back of the space.   Our server, who was very knowledgeable of the food and wine menu offered great advice--the menu used to be more Mediterranean and those dishes are still the highlights. I ordered the tomato and burrata salad and the scallops as a main course. The burrata was amazing--much more authentic than what one usually gets in the states. The chef made me a dinner portion of the scallops, which are usually an appetizer. I was served four perfectly seared scallops served on sauteed spinach and forbidden rice. It was to die for. Best thing I've eaten in years. It was also too rich for me for a main course--I should have stuck with the appetizer portion (two scallops) but I have no regrets.   My partner ordered off the two course summer menu ($38) and got the corn chowder and oven roasted chicken. His dishes were much more rustic than mine but no less delicious. I would have devoured his soup if he'd have let me. We were also brought pesto and rosemary focaccia before the meal and it was delicious. On the downside, we sat for close to 15 minutes before our server got to us--I think there might have been a mix up on whose table we were. I also found the service a little on the chatty side, but it was friendly so no real complaints there.  I was less impressed with breakfast. We ordered lattes and a sticky bun, the Mediterranean Benedict and the avocado toast. The coffee was great--served with raw sugar lumps and biscotti. Our server also brought coffee cake muffins. The sticky bun was heaven. My eggs were cooked perfectly, but were served over left over focaccia. I felt like the rosemary from the bread overpowered the flavors in the hollandaise and don't mesh well with the smoked salmon. My partner had similar blah feelings about his avocado toast--it wasn't great.  Dinner was worth making a return trip. T Cook's is too pricey for a regular stop for us, but as a treat it is great.",

    "text": "This review is for brunch...4 1/2 stars for sure!  We were among a small group seated outside on a beautiful Sunday morning.  Brunch is a set $46 per person.   You're paying for quality and quantity.    You are presented with a menu from which to pick an appetizer and an entree.  In addition, there's a small buffet that includes excellent shrimp cocktail, crab claws (my fave!), caesar salad, marvelous cheeses, pastries (I loved the blueberry), fresh fruit including an assortment of berries and pineapple, and other items.  And the price also includes two mimosas and coffee or tea.    The most intriguing part of the menu imho are the tapas:  Beef Tartare, Mushroom Crepe, Foie Gras w/French Toast, Hummus.  All of which our table got. There was also a Tomato Bruschetta option.  I must admit I was disappointed in the Tartare.  It really needed some acid or something to brighten it up.  The Hummus was delicious but way too much for one person.  Foie Gras was very rich.  I'm not sure I'd call the bread that was with it French Toast, but that and the berries were a nice balance to the liver. Husband really liked his mushroom crepe.  As for the entrees, we had our choice of Grilled Smoked Ham Steak with Eggs, Ricotta Blueberry Pancakes,  Spanish Chorizo Benedict,  Paella, Fried Chicken, Grilled Flat Iron Steak with Chimichurri and Fries, Eggs & Pupusa, Scallops, or Sea Bass.  I headed straight for the Scallops while Husband did the Steak.  Both of our entrees were really good.  Loved my perfectly seared scallops with cannellini bean puree, carrot and bacon.  Mmmm!  Husband was happy with his steak and fries as well, but it has to be the first time I've ever seen him waste a lot.  It was just too much.  If you make it to dessert (and I suggest you do), they are thankfully small.  We shared a teeny lemon meringue tart, and a key lime dessert.  There were also chocolate and raspberry desserts.    Service was entertaining and enthusiastic, which I really like.   Husband was kept topped up with coffee, but I never got a re-fill on my excellent iced tea.    If you live in the area and can take home some of what you can't eat (if they allow it), it would sure make me feel better, because I hate to waste food!  With the buffet part, we can control what we choose and only pick what we can eat, but when presented with the appetizer and entree in large portions, it can lead to too much waste, imho.  Otherwise, a lovely and delicious experience in a beautiful historic setting.    Note:  parking is free and easy, but you can valet it if you so choose.",

We started out with the charcuterie board it was the perfect amount of cheese to meat ratio , They also bring you a complimentary bread with pesto that is very good. We ordered the Beef Short rib with Farro & the Wagu Sirloin with a lobsters risotto and asparagus. That for me was the star of the two dishes the meat was tender and cooked to perfection. Lastly we ended the night with the 7 layer Bananas cake with pecan ice cream. My only complaint would be for the size of cake they serve you it need at least 2-3 scoops of that delicious ice cream very heavy and rich we couldn't even finish it but was something I will be making a special trip for again in itself. This place is pricey but the food was very good nothing lacked in flavor or portion size. I hear they have a great brunch so will be doing that very soon with some girlfriends. The grounds are beautiful and I can't wait to return soon.",

    "text": "Since my last review the menu and chef has changed.  T Cooks is an upscale Mediterranean Restaurant located at the Royal Palms in Phoenix. This once was a winter vacation home of a wealthy New York Person and now it's a beautiful Spanish Style Resort and Spa with T Cooks Restaurant.  The dining room is very dramatic with high ceilings and very mature palm trees growing threw the dining room.  They start everyone off with tasty rosemary focaccia and fresh pesto.  It was restaurant week fall 2018 3 courses for $44.00 so we ordered off that menu.  I started with Moroccan Spiced Carrot Soup. It had delicious warm flavors, a rich mouth feel and pops of sweet raisin in it but was painfully salt forward to me. I did tell my server and he insisted on having the kitchen fix the soup. He took it back and they watered it down and when he brought it back it indeed was less salty. (*****this is highly unusual)   My husband had the Butternut Squash Agnolotti. They were very similar to ravioli with nice well made thin pasta skins. They were generously stuffed with sweet seasoned butternut squash. They were described to be in a sage brown butter sauce but if you take the time to view my photo it's more like they were in a parsley melted butter sauce.....This dish ran on the sweet side.  For me and my husband our favorite bite of the evening was the Pan Seared Glacier Sea Bass. The fish was very fresh and was cooked to perfection. The beet/bean puree and almonds were tasty. The Tomatoes were very salt forward.  The Petite Filet my husband had did have nice grill marks and was also prepared to his request (M/R) but lacked salt and pepper. White Cheddar  Grits with Bacon wrapped haricots verts were excellent.  Of the two desserts one we loved and one we didn't.  The Butter Croissant Bread Pudding was heavy and very dense. I didn't care for the flavors either.  The Crema Catalana had a nice not burnt tasting thin hard shell and contained cream that was smooth and DELICIOUS with a sort of bitter kind of orange taste.   Stand outs were- Focaccia and Pesto Glacier Sea Bass Cheddar Grits Crema Catalana Attentive Service Lovely Atmosphere  Valet parking only",

The reason I gave the three stars is I ordered the snake river strip loin medium rare. When I cut into the steak it was raw. I called the server over to send it back. When it came back to me it was brought back by a food runner with no apology from the server or a manager. An apology with the question \"is it prepared to your liking\" goes a long way. Also I found it interesting the quarter of the steak I cut off to see how it was cooked was missing when it returned to me.",

    "text": "We came here for an early NYE date night since my husband was scheduled to work on NYE and we had a great meal. We were able to sit on the patio where they had loads of heaters and it was actually the perfect temperature, even in December! There was a table facing the fireplace that looked so romantic and cozy. When we asked to sit there, they told us that it was reserved but then no one came the entire time that we were there! :( So we were a little bummed that we had to sit in the corner of the patio when that was open, but hey, can't win them all I suppose!  For food, we started with their scallop appetizer and it was SO TASTY! My only complaint was that you get 2 scallops for $16. Whew, a little pricy but the flavors were extraordinary. I think even if they had 3, that would have been a good amount. 2 just seemed a little weird on the plate. They also brought DELICIOUS bread and pesto. You could tell the pesto was made fresh there on site. We also ordered a bottle of  Cabernet and it was the perfect compliment to our meal.   Next, my husband and I split the heirloom beet salad and it was one of the best beet salads that i've ever had. The feta dressing was phenomenal! The arugula was nice and peppery - just the way I like it.  For my entree, I ordered their Flat Iron Steak and it was SO tender! It seriously rivaled a filet and was a great portion size. It is served with their signature steak sauce that I absolutely loved as well. For sides, we split the fries with truffle aioli and Haricot Vert Nicoise (green beans served cold with olives, feta, and a lemony/vinaigrette dressing). THEY WERE AMAZING!   For dessert we split their gelato (served on an ice block!) and cookies and the lavender gelato was dreamyyyyy! The cookies didn't knock my socks off but the gelato was well worth it.   All in all, the culinary talent here is great! For the price range, I have had better meals at other Valley establishments but we definitely didn't leave hungry and our tastebuds were happy! :)",

    "text": "I would say a 4.5 would be a fair statement to make. The Royal Palms is a beautiful resort with a rich history; However! Certain things need to be slightly updated (the spa and the villas) stay tuned for my resort review. The ambiance in T Cook's probably has received the most TLC as it is a renowned restaurant but we have a tiny bit more to do with the interior (not a full on facelift but maybe a small tuck) I understand the history of the resort so I am not suggesting an industrial theme like wall to wall steel and cement floors but little things can make a difference. BRUNCH!  Started with the Maine diver scallops, so fresh with bacon bits and spinach. It came with a carrot ginger puree, I am not a fan of carrots but the hint of ginger complimented it nicely. We ordered the fresh berries and the vanilla yogurt, the berries were so fresh and visually stimulating and the yogurt was the best I've ever had (he agreed as well) Huevos Rancheros delicious! Probably the freshest Avocado I have ever had, the corn tortilla perfectly crispy. ONLY CON: My over easy egg was perfect when I cut into it, oozing just as it should, my friend said his egg while delicious was slightly over cooked. The staff was fantastic they don't hover but you always know they are nearby. The coffee is strong and firm just how we like it!",

    "text": "Stellar!! This is a well earned five star review. Why? Read on....  Atmosphere: this place is really beautiful inside. The resort itself is also beautiful. But, this restaurant does not try to make it self classy by leaning on the beauty of the resort and natural surroundings. The restaurant itself is warm, classy but not stuffy at all, with high ceilings, beautiful fixtures and lighting, warm woods, spacious, soft, somehow modern yet with classic warmth and style, tables are beautifully set with quality components and everything you need is at your fingertips, it's extremely comfortable. Heavy wood chairs with soft padded seating, super comfortable to stay for hours and relax.  Service: The server and  assistants ensure you have everything you need here. They are knowledgeable and prompt without hovering. Such a great feeling to experience wait staff that seems genuinely interested in your comfort and experience. Everyone working here was clearly happy to assist, even if they weren't \"assigned\" to your table. Extremely service oriented. Excellent!  Food: outstanding! The four of us all thoroughly enjoyed our appetizers, the delicious bread they serve while you wait for your entrees, and our entrees themselves, as well as the adult beverages. Every detail of every morsel was prepared with high-quality ingredients and a chefs touch. All foods were well balanced, flavorful and seasoned perfectly. Served at just the right temperature, without long waits and with solid, high quality,, comfortable, flatware, silverware, and glass. Appetizers, meals and even the drinks are plentiful and delicious. The entire \"food experience\" was excellent.  Value: in my opinion, your truly eating at a five-star restaurant, with outstanding, chef prepared meals, served by staff who are mature, knowledgeable, friendly and attentive, in an environment that is warm and comfortable and inviting. It's hard to beat for the appropriate prices, which are reasonable for the excellent experience, quality and quantity.  There was one thing I really didn't like and it started off our experience with an uncomfortable bump, it was the valet and parking situation. I fault the resort for this more so than the restaurant. I was driving a high horse power convertible sports car that night and prefer not to let valets drive it (scary flashbacks of Ferris Bueller's Day Off), so I asked to self park. Once I did, the valets fake friendly, interested demeanor immediately changed to being dismissive, uncaring, \"Oh, I'm not going to make a few bucks off of you and I can't drive your nice car? Then I could care less!!\" I found myself cramming my nice car into a small spot in a very, very small, dark parking lot with no more than 15 or 20 spots. In hindsight, I should have parked between the palm trees around the traffic circle in front of the restaurant like I noticed others had done when we left. This was not a good start to our experience at the location. Again, I'm choosing not to fault the restaurant for the parking situation at the resort.  I highly recommend T Cooks for all reasons stated above. Honestly, I can't wait to go back, it's one of my new favorite places. My only regret is that I didn't find this place is much, much sooner.",

Beautiful ambience, excellent food and service, this place has it all. I had the winter pear salad and the crispy salmon.  We also ordered the lobster bisque and the chicken salad sandwich.  We each ordered a flight of wines, which is a bargain at $25 and highly recommended.  We shared the dessert tasting (your choice of three small desserts for $8).  They also have a cozy little chef's table for two. T Cook's was the highlight of our weekend in Phoenix!",

Try the Sonoran Sage for an interesting take on a gin martini. After drinks we went inside to the main dining room with a wood fired grill. They have both an ala carte and tasting menu. Our party of four had a variety of interesting dishes which included seared foie gras, frogs legs, octopus, scallops, lamb osso buco, flat iron steak with exotic mushrooms and a braised short rib. We washed it down with a 2000 Dunn Howell Mountain cabernet. The service and wine service were outstanding and the food was delicious. I can't comment on the value as it was comped via a friend's trade agreement with the hotel. I would definitely eat hear again even if it were on my own dime. I highly recommend the lamb osso buco with it's North African flavor profile, simply outstanding. We had breakfast here the next morning and the food was well prepared and delicious. I had the Huevos Rancheros with house made spicy chorizo. The other in our part said their breakfast dishes were also very good and included the Mediterranean style eggs Benedict and corned beef hash. Great service and an endless cup of coffee rounded out a great experience at the resort.",

This place is UNBELIEVABLE for breakfast and Lunch (i have heard great things about dinner as well although i have yet to enjoy it).   i have only been for lunch twice, but both times were fantastic.  The first time i had the Burger (wonderful) and the second time i believe it was the Halibut (could have been Seabass) and was equally as delicious (i have posted a photo).  What i really want to talk about is their Breakfast though...OMG-favorite spot in town.  I am a huge eggs benny fan and they have this Mediterranean version that is out of this world.  It's on Focaccia bread with prosciutto and this red bell pepper hollandaise sauce...SO GOOD (i have also included a photo of this dish).  Also, try their green eggs and ham.  :)  Hope you all enjoy this place as much as i do!!  Bon Appetit!",

    "text": "Impeccable, memorable,  5 star service  was our experience from every employee.  Staff  were warm and attentive;  you imagine your at a friend's Estate and all the staff have been instructed to treat you royally, and we were.  Food at T. Cook's  honestly was for the price and everything considered  a 3.5 which ends at  a 4 star average because of the service.   We did the $99 summer 3 course meal:  I ordered a Cherry blossom cocktail  $12. I was imagining this to come out in some hip glassware with  some kind of cool cherry blossom fruit/flower flair, but no just a normal glass, kind of like you would get any average place.  Wow the description of the cocktail had me thinking up something divine. Ok back on point,,, Bread:  Served Warm, toasty (it better be, this is one of  my pet-peeves, it must always be W/T. It was.  Served with delicious, outstanding pesto.   I ordered the crab cake for my 1st course and it was good;but it is contending with Crab cakes I've had in Maui at Mama's Fish house. Beach Vs Desert crabcake? It isn't a fair match but a definite honorable mention for desert contender. Regardless I've still got my Cheshire cat happy face on.  2nd course : Neiman Ranch Pork CHop with balsamic glaze.   Excellent cut of meat ,tasted like steak, but for me the glaze was a little salty.  This was accompanied by baby carrots & Potatoes Anna, my carrots were kind of hard I really had to pin them down to get a bite prepared.  I was wishing I had Lorraine not Anna on the potato front; mine were kind of  bland.   Dessert : Chocolate truffle ganache cake,HOME RUN!! OUTSTANDING!!!!!  Total Bill w tip included $175.  Summary, Considering the overall value and we went here on a gift certificate I might  feel compelled to remove a  star if on our own dime/ dollar. but again customer service was outstanding so I think overall you pay for that and it did make for a special occasion, so verdict remains!   I would love to come back for dessert anytime ] .  The grounds are pristine!! It is a gem of a resort.",

I mean the night I showed up, well it was night, but it was also pouring down rain, and even through all of that Royal Palms was pretty enough to make me stop and look around before rushing in out of the weather. I headed into the bar to meet up with a few folks and the interior is just a beautiful space - warm and welcoming, and very classy. Bring people here that you want to impress.  I, of course, had to order a glass of champagne and the lovely server brought it right to me. Perhaps she sensed I had been delayed at the airport that day before arriving to Phoenix for 7 hours? Or more likely they are just very good at what they do here. We immediately ordered since it was so late and I started with a pear, pecan, and blue cheese salad. For my main course I choose a seared Irish salmon that was served with leeks, tomato gratin, and a pea puree. It was all fantastic, but the tomato gratin made me want to invite the chef to move to LA with me. I mean no way could I afford that now, but a girl can dream!  We finished by sharing a couple of desserts and the one I chose was the Florale. It was made with lychee mousse and was quite light and just a bit tart. All in all a delicious ending to a delicious meal.",

This place has such great potential, but its face just seems to keep writing a check that your stomach can't check.   The devil is in the details, and for some reason, the details all fall short here. Its not that the food is bad...its quite good, actually. But for the price you pay, it should be perfect, not \"quite good\". Specifically, every bit of cooked meat that was offered was over-cooked and dry. Homemade chicken sausage looked delicious, but was nearly flavorless and seriously, I think I could get a more moist piece of chicken cooking it in the microwave. The fresh grill was lamb, which I love. Again, very very dry. That just sucks.  And again, as with my last review from a year ago, if I'm spending the extra money on an entree, don't then give me an item on my plate that is readily available on the buffet that is included in the price. That makes me feel ripped off, and that your chefs are just plain lazy.  So, for not fixing anything in the last year, I'm demoting this place by a star. I did, however like the new buffet and menu items. And, as always, the staff was friendly and attentive, professional and unobtrusive. Keep that up, but fix the stupid shit please! See you in a year.",

    "text": "You've got be kidding me. Possibly the worst upscale dining experience I've ever had. I don't mind paying a lot for food when it's good, but this just felt like complete robbery. So many things wrong from start to finish.   My brother asked for his ribeye black and blue (very rare) and it came out medium.  For a $50 steak you gotta get it right. On top of that, four out of our five entrees sat outside getting cold (we were eating outside in January) while waiting several minutes for the fifth to arrive. When it finally did come, it was excruciating to watch the backserver study the ticket at length before placing each dish at the table.  When the food is that much at risk of getting cold, you should have more than one person serving.   Another thing I cannot forgive is the lobster. From the description and the $44 price, you assume it is a whole lobster. In fact it is a claw and half a tail, the same thing they have as a side dish for $20. The preparation and side dishes were very minimalist, so I'm not sure what that extra twenty four bucks is for. Like I said I expect a certain markup for good food, but you don't have to gouge people quite so egregiously.   I started with the lobster bisque, a \"house specialty.\" Not really remarkable, basically what you expect. For entree I had the scallops with chorizo and basquaise sauce. I like each of those things individually, but together they were just fighting in my mouth. Desserts were nothing worth writing about.  Food and service are below average for this price level, period. The only thing you can say is that the hotel surroundings are attractive. With so many good restaurants in the area, there's No Excuse for going here. Go to Tarbell's down the street and enjoy a superior experience.",

Our waiter Marc kept rudely interrupting conversations to ask again and again if we had any questions.  It was as if he were trying to rush us so he could have table turn over. When we ordered a bottle of Cabernet off the regular wine list (not the reserve list) he told us he was out of Cabernet? When I told him I couldn't believe that and wanted to speak with a manager he came back with the wine? Really? He kept interrupting us wanting to take the order again and again. He told us salads were very large and suggested we split them.  Well, they are not large and just perfect for one. Entrees were just okay.  The duck was tough and cooked very rare (I ordered it medium) served with a side of something very bland. My wife had a fish dish that was very good.  All in all I would not go back due to horrible service and average food, Too bad because the Royal Palms is a beautiful property.",

The restaurant is very lovely, and for the staff alone I would go there again as they were really courteous. However, our service was really disappointing. We ordered our food at 7:30 but didn't even get the bread until almost 9, and that was after asking our waiter twice when we could expect our food. Finally the bread came out, and after another ten minutes our main course came out.  The only problem was that they completely left my order off the ticket. It was another 10-15 minutes before my meal arrived, making my wait time well over an hour.  However, all issues aside, the Bass I had was incredible and well worth the price of $30. On the plus side, they were embarrassed by their poor service, so they gave us free dessert and took 25% off our whole tab.",

    "text": "PLENTY of reasons not to give five stars.  For the, ahem,  \"upscale\" pricing, the quality of the food should be absolutely superb. It simply is not.   While the atmosphere is lovely and the service was very good, the food was a huge disappointment. I had the flaxseed vegetable napoleon for the first course. It was completely underwhelming and the flaxseed patties were impossible to cut through. Additionally, the taste was not very good.  For my main course I had the New York strip steak. It was good. The brussels sprouts were great, but the Yorkshire pudding was not thrilling--perhaps that is a matter of personal taste. The pesto that is served with the bread was awesome--but messing up pesto is pretty hard to do.   The side of whipped potatoes were WAY over-salted, and the mac and cheese was entirely underwhelming. I felt like we paid an outrageous price simply because it said \"truffle\" on the menu. In reality, the flavor was salty, decidedly average, and it was quite dry. Very disappointing.  For dessert we shared the eclaires and the gingerbread/apple upside down cake. The eclaires were absolutely nothing special. I have had better, many times in my life. It was very saddening because we had heard such raving comments about the pastry chef, and in fact the quality of the pastry--both in taste and texture--was pretty sub-par for a dessert that costs like 20 bucks. The ginger cake was good, but unmemorable.   The service and the steak were the best parts about the experience. The steak was very good, and the service was also good but I have had better and more helpful in other places.   For a meal that essentially cost $100 per person, the taste was AVERAGE, and the overall quality of the food was horribly disappointing. Every single person in our party agreed. It is very easy to be taken with the fancy atmosphere and get carried away thinking the food is a lot better than it is because it looks pretty, it costs a lot, and the Royal Palms is beautiful. Don't let the external appearances fool you. Taste the food for what it is. Disappointing for the price.  EDIT: It should be mentioned, however, that the lobster bisque was absolutely delicious, far better than anything else I ate the whole night. Very, very good.",

Set in the Royal Palms, you walk through a lovely garden to get to the restaurant. It was raining the day we went, so we coudln't sit outside, but I'm sure it's beautiful.  We started with a couple glasses of wine, and the charcuterie plate. My bf loves cured meats, and we often order a similar appetizer at one of our favorite restaurants close to home. So we were terribly disappointed to be served a plate with only a couple slices of maybe 4 different meats, a small slice of pate, sliced pickles, a bit of mustard. That's it? For $13? The bread was served with some delicious pesto, but quite a bit of it, considering there were only 2 of us.  For entrees, bf ordered the seared scallops, and I had the short rib. His tasted fine to me, but I only had 1 bite. Halfway through the meal, he thought it smelled like BO, and couldn't finish it. Mine was ok, really nothing to write home about. Maybe we didn't order the right things, but we just were not impressed.  Service was great all the way through, thus the 3 stars. For me, the food wasn't bad, but nothing spectacular, as it should have been for the prices. Not sure what I was missing, but I just couldn't say this was a great experience.",

    "text": "Another great dinner in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  We tried out T. Cooks for our Saturday dinner date.  Located in the Royal Palms resort, I enjoyed how cozy the resort and restaurant were.    We got there a little early and had to wait for a few minutes at the bar.  I ended up with a espressotini which was delicious and satisfied my caffeine need.  The bar scene and I guess dining scene was unique.  Definitely a much older crowd, lots of couples, and lots of people wanting attention.    The food at this place was excellent.  We started off with the cheese and prosciutto platter which was okay and we could have done without.  A huge loaf of bread and pesto dip was provided and was super yummy.  For my entree I had the fillet mignon with potatoes au gratin.  That steak was perfect and melted in my mouth.  My entree filled me up so much I ended up skipping dessert.  Service was great as well.  They took care of us but allowed us to have our space.   Oh and one final note, they have complimentary valet.",

    "text": "My husband and I had New Year's Eve dinner there. For the prices we paid (about $150+tax & tip per person), we expected better and more food. The food was just not that great. One of our dishes was cold, but they quickly replaced it after we complained. And the dessert was just not up to par. I only had a few bites and didn't want to eat more. So we paid like $300+tax and tip all together for not so great food.   Plus the crowd who ate there was stuffy. Most of the women who went there showed up either with a mink coat or a mink stole (and the restaurant told us the attire is resort casual). And don't bother trying to make casual conversation with the patrons there. Most likely they won't talk back.   Yes, like what the other Yelper said - it's a stuffy, pretentious, uncomfortable and mediocre place. If you want good food and good service - go next store to J & G Steakhouse at the Phoenician. We had some excellent food for very reasonable prices there!",

    "text": "I was accompanied by an out of town guest, last Saturday evening. Our waiter was Robert. He was so helpful to us in making our selections, and extremely attentive. We followed his recommendations and he was spot on!  We wanted two appetizers and to split the entree. We had the Beet Salad and the Corn Anglioti. Delicious!  The chef was doing a 10 oz. (Not kidding) rib eye. It was served on a bed of teeny tasty tender baby mushrooms, asparagus. Topped with a very light, almost fluffy, Bernaise (not heavy) and a bit of crab. Sprinkled around the plate were tiny, crunchy, coffee chips. So, If you took a bite of the steak (perfectly med-rare), mushrooms and coffee chips, it literally was an explosion in your mouth!  Such complimentary components that really worked. The chef even divided up the plate, including the steak, for sharing.  I could not finish my half, much to the delight of my friend. He was happy to finish.  To end, we had 3 scoops of their homemade ice cream, creatively served in a rectangular dish, with a thick slice of ice to fit the dish. Scoops were placed on the ice piece!  Loved it!  This place is classically Scottsdale, enveloped by the spectacular Royal Palms Resort. A leisurely meal in a truly beautiful setting.  My friend was impressed.",

    "text": "This past weekend we stayed at the Royal Palms....a beautiful place in Scottsdale.  Their restaurant certainly matched the ambience of the resort.  Dark, warm decor, rustic feel.  We were dining in a large group, so that may have knocked a star off my review, but I felt that for the level of the resort the restaurant was fair, not great.  We had the lobster bisque for starters, and it was ok....not a standout compared to others I have had.  My wife had the lobster tortellini and it was again good, not great....although the presentation was artful, it just lacked any wow factor in spicing, texture or even the basic preparation of the lobster (slightly overdone, not as succulent as it should have been).   I had the 21 day dry aged ribeye.  It was pretty good, cooked perfectly, but was a bit pricey.  The ribeye came with truffled grits and hamakua mushrooms which were ok.  There are better picks in nearby downtown Scottsdale, but if you enjoying this beautiful resort and don't feel like driving you can get a good dinner here.",

I like the atmosphere and attentiveness of the wait staff, and I could drink by the gallon that pesto sauce thing they give you for the bread. I had the best gnocchi in the world there, but since their menu changes all the time, it's a crap shoot whether or not I'll ever have that again. I like it because since I'm so not into dressing up for dinner unless I have a super hot date, it's okay to go somewhat biz casual. The strawberry salad is good, and I can't even remember what I had for dessert, but whatever it was, it was delicious. People have complaints about the prices, but I say have business meetings there!",

This year, was by far, the best year yet. The new chef is amazing, far better than the previous one. The food pairings are amazing, never had foods that went so well together. Our waiter was great, he knew the menu and suggested amazing dishes.  The dishes are on the smaller side, but that is so you can have a full 3 course meal. I'm not big on trying new things, but this is the only place that I will try something new. Love coming out here, the atmosphere is impeccable, the singer the bar had, was not loud, she was singing at a very reasonable, soft level that made the experience that more enjoyable. I personally think the quality of food is worth the prices. I know that this isn't your Mimi's or Taco Bell, this is a nice, fancy place that we go to once or twice a year, so we don't mind forking over the cash :)",

Had eaten here a few times in the past but was never very impressed with the food.  And thanks to the reviews on Yelp still wasn't keen on going.  We went early to enjoy the happy hour which some had raved about.  I ordered the house martini, a vodka I had never heard of and surprisingly it was ok.  We had the tuna etutanesca, a \"seared\" tuna--it WAS NOT seared but tasty, the edamame, good, and the pretzel bites with a cold cheese fondue which had to be sent back to be warmed.  Wine selection is not good---when Mirasou is on the wine menu at such an upscale restaurant you have to wonder---at least I did.  Wasn't really hungry but decided to have dinner anyway to use up the certificate.  We started with Lobster Bisque, HORRIBLE!--wrong color, did not taste any lobster and the garnish was mussel I believe.  Wanted the grilled peach salad--no peaches available--so shared the Asian Pear Salad, and still had some left over.  It was ok.  We also shared the Carbonara, tasty.  I finished off with the gelato and coffee ---good.  So with tips and the food we ended up spending $15.00 out of pocket.  I love the atmosphere but definitely will not be going back on my dime.",

The grounds are beautiful, the bar area is warm and inviting and the food is delicous.  I recommend sitting outside and highly recommend getting the lobster tortellini with lobster on top - a little rich (I'd like it better without the butter sauce I think), but just delectable.  They have a wonderful wine list too - extensive and not outrageously priced.     It will continue to be on my list of must visits when I'm in PHX!",

A slam dunk for my husband and I as he loves meat and I am a vegetarian and it is tricky to find a fine dining establishment that will create a real entree for a vegetarian (as opposed to a pasta dish or clumping 3 sides together).   The chef completely created a customized dish for me that included morel mushrooms.  It was divine!  My husband loved his as well.  Server was really personable and nice.  This really was a 5 star experience.",

Yes, I took pictures, like the damn tourist I was.    The restaurant is really cute.  We came on a Sunday, so they have brunch.  I had the blueberry pancakes, which were very good.  The whipped cream on top was heavenly- so fresh and I could tell, freshly made.  My girlfriend had the lemon brioche french toast with a side of chicken sausage.  That was also very good.  The bellini's were standard, but the bloody mary's, delicious.  I was never a bloody mary girl, until my sister got me started... and now, I finally get it.  This was the right combination of tart, spicy, sweet, and vodka!  My mouth is watering right now.  Damn it.    The clientele here was 1. older 2. women.  A cute place to go with your family.  Also a cute place to go with the girls for lunch.  There's a little smoking room to the side, where (I think) you can smoke cigars.  Love that.  I also think this place would be great for a wedding reception, rehearsal dinner, or party.",

Pulling up to the Royal Palms, you are immediately engulfed in a different world, one of serenity and pure bliss.  We got to T. Cooks and our friends were on the patio.  It was a beautiful day to enjoy the wonderful Phoenix weather.  Immediately we were greated by Brad one of the nicest most friendly and accomodating servers I have ever encountered.  He was constantly provided high level service without being intrusive.  He made sure we were well tended to.  If it were him and service alone, this place would get a 10 star.  Now the food. Prices are reasonable for a resort.  Our table got the Pot Roast, Eggs Benedict on Foccaccia bread and the Red Velvet French Toast.  I would say 2/4 of us were happy with our food.  The french toast was a bit burned and didn't really taste like much.  The eggs benedict was good however a very small portion. Overall it wasn't bad but probably will never go back for brunch.  I hear the happy hour is good?!?",

We had friends in from CT, and we used the Travelzoo discount deal.    The fresh seafood was to die for... I LOVED the crab claws and shrimp, and the beef was also excellent.  The salads were crisp and fresh, and those at our table who had personal omelets really enjoyed them.  Wish there were more interesting fresh, artisan breads to go with!    We were able to self-park, which we always prefer, and had a very enjoyable time at a lovely venue.",

One disappointment: given that we planned ahead for the event for a birthday party of 12 - they had us set up six seats to two round tables. Not only we were a bit squished, we weren't all together. Fortunately, they accommodated us by moving a few tables together - but only after we asked and only after other diners left. This should have been a no-brainer. Still recommended.",

Especially this time of year - there are great values to be had, at incredible prices!  Here's the Mix Up current specials menu: Daily - happy hour 4-7; $5.00 cocktails, beer, wine and lite bites. Tuesdays - Pizza & Punch $5 flatbreads, $6 signature punch cocktail of the day: 4:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m. Women & Whiskey Wednesdays - 1/2 price ladies bourbon night: 4:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m. Bourbon & Burgers Thursdays - $8 burger, 1/2 price bourbons: 4:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m.  .Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Went to t cooks with my dad for Christmas Eve and was disappointed.   First time back since the re-opening.  Bread and appetizers were good. Was disappointed that we hadn't checked ahead of time to see if it was a pre fixe menu, but weren't too disappointed, until....  My dad ordered salmon and felt that it was severely undercooked. Asked a waiter (because ours was nowhere to be seen) if that was how the dish was supposed to be prepared. He said yes the salmon is typically prepared medium rare (like sashimi on the inside), but he would be happy to have the chef put it on for a bit longer.   While he was gone, our waitress came back, and when she asked why my dad no longer had his plate and we explained, she pursed her lips and seemed very disappointed in our attitude. She asked if my venison was cooked to my liking and I said yes.   A few minutes later the manager brought out the new plate of salmon and apologized for the mistake. We said it was no problem and asked again if that was the way the salmon was supposed to be prepared. The manager said absolutely not and he and the chef apologized for the mishap. When my dad cut into the new plate of salmon it had the same error. In the interest of not being difficult and getting on with the meal he didn't make a fuss about it and said it was fine. The manager looked at me inquisitively because he could tell my dad was not satisfied, but I apologetically said it was fine and he left.   Our waitress came back shortly and asked how the salmon was. My dad said it was still a bit underdone for his taste but it was fine. She said, \"well, that's how I like mine, but I know some people prefer theirs overlooked.\" This was the most offensive part of the meal. When we are paying $88 a person, we don't care how our waitress prefers her meal, we prefer it to be cooked to our liking, i.e. cooked.  The dessert was fine but nothing to write home about. However, when we received our bill we were supremely disappointed to see that no discount had been added to our bill for the inconvenience of the mishap, especially with the manager knowing that even the re-cook was not satisfactory. For such an expensive meal at such a renowned restaurant, something should have been done to rectify the situation.  Furthermore, the waitress should never have given her condescending opinion of how she preferred her own fish cooked. It was odd that when I ordered the venison, she took care to ask if the typical medium rare preparation was acceptable for the meat while she did not inquire the same in regards to the fish, when it is highly rare to cook fish that way in a restaurant. I cannot imagine that other restaurant patrons have not had similar reactions to the fish if this is indeed, their standard preparation.   Overall, felt gypped, condescended to, and disappointed in what should have been a very special meal at one of the supposedly best restaurants at one of the best hotels in the city.",

The hostess was very nice when we checked in at the restaurant. She placed rose petals on our table which was a cute touch.  The poor review was mainly because of our waiter. He was very short with us. Didn't go over the menu like you would expect from a fine dining restaurant/resort. I don't know if it's because we are gay or if he just was in a bad mood but it was just poor service. We even heard another waiter ask their table if they could bring their valet ticket to the valet. Our service we just poor.  The food was good though. We did enjoy that. The flat iron steak wasn't really to my liking. Too dry. But the risotto was really good.",

    "text": "A friend and I went to T Cook's last night for restaurant week. We had been wanting to try this place for a long time and were excited to go. This restaurant is valet only (which, if you know me, you know I have a problem with), so we dropped the car with the friendly valet and headed in. The grounds of this hotel/restaurant are beautiful and very well maintained. We were seated at this table with odd high back chairs that make you feel somewhat secluded from the rest of the restaurant. This would be nice except it seemed that it also secluded us from timely service. We were seated and given the regular menu and left for a long time. We had to ask for the restaurant week menu when the waiter (finally) came back. Not sure why they didn't bring out the menu originally... did they think if they didn't provide the restaurant week menu more people would order off the regular menu (when most of the people were probably there for RW). Anyway, our meal took a looooooong time, with many long pauses between ordering and courses. Otherwise, the waiter was pleasant enough. I started the meal with the corn bisque, which was very rich, creamy and tasty. It was easily the best part of the meal. My friend had the greens with the strawberries, and this was tasty as well. The mains were far less impressive. I had the saffron pappardelle and my friend had the chicken. The pappardelle was alright, but tasted sort of plain considering the ingredients. The lamb was not showcased, the mint it had on it was so minimal you couldn't taste it, and overall it tasted like something you could easily make at home. It also came out luke warm and the ricotta they put on it was ice cold. The chicken looked amazing, but also came out luke warm and had an odd flavor... sort of like a cleanser scent... it was odd. The chicken was sliced and lost any juiciness it may have had when cooked. Though neither dish was terrible, neither tasted like it came from a high end, expensive restaurant. I'm not sure why they chose to showcase these items on their RW menu, but I hope this isn't the best they have to offer, because it wasn't very impressive. The dessert presentation was beautiful... this place really excels in presentation.... but again, it didn't have that 'yummy' factor that is so important in a dessert. I had the chocolate torte, which was fun and had some great garnishes (the pretzel ice cream was surprisingly savory and tasty... the popcorn brittle stuff was awesome), but the torte itself wasn't that great. It was a milk chocolate and would have tasted much better if it were a dark chocolate... it didn't have that rich chocolatey flavor that you envision when you order a torte. My friend had the cheesecake, which was good, but again, nothing special. Overall, I probably wouldn't come back here considering the mediocre nature of the food and the price.   PS when I was leaving, the valet went to get my car and brought someone else's car out.... that's a pretty big mistake... what's the point of valet if they're going to give your car to other people.... eeek. They did apologize and were nice, but I would be pretty upset if someone drove off in my car.",

The restaurant setting has always been when Fred first did and subsequent owner if one if the best. Wine was great. Desert seemed average.

The service was perfect.    We ordered the bison tar tar, and I really loved it.  The portion was huge, we couldn't finish it.  I had a martinez, it was made great! I had the short ribs with bone marrow and my Hubby had the chicken with sausage.  I loved my meal, it had so many flavors, the vanilla onions took it to another level, and the marrow, wow! I tasted my Hubby's meal and it was very good.  I would say we would chose something else next time, but it was still great.  The sausage was not that good.  We also had the chocolate dessert, I would pass on this next time. The cake was not my thing and part of the flavor wasn't what I dream of when I dream chocolate dreams :) I would love to try the apple fritters maybe.    I am excited to go back also because they give you a surprise gift you open on your next visit...  I can't wait to come back and just happy hour it, the bar was beautiful and the music was so impressive.",

Hopefully management will improve the quality and dining experience of the restaurant.

The $45 new york strip was ordered medium rare and came out medium, same is True for my wife's beef tenderloin. The presentation was very nice.

My host was told over the phone they offered corkage, we arrive with bottles to be told no.  We had an early reservation, 5:30p and the service was unusually rushed.  Likely as they were try to turn the table three times that night?  My partners flank steak was awesome, especially the duck fat chips.  Dessert was the highlight, while the flourless chocolate was nice, it was very rich and heavy.  The salted Carmel ice cream was fantastic.  I feel like this restaurant is trying to accommodate more tables than it can really handle.  If so they should lower their prices to raise the rating in my book.

I'm not a wine geek but others in the group were happy with what we ordered...  Definitely a must see experience in PHOENIX!!!",

I had an amazing spinach salad with a poached egg.  I followed that with the petit filet which has a small cut of ribs on top (ribs and filet?  yes please).  The veggies served with it were great.   I finished my meal with fresh berries and cream.   It's expensive but I didn't think it was anything too crazy.  And obviously when you pay, you want it to be great and it was.  i'd go back for sure.",

    "text": "This is for attempted brunch only. Wife's birthday last weekend. Did a stay-cation at the Royal Palms, partly because we wanted to have their Sunday Market brunch. The hotel is beautiful although the rooms are outdated. I had a member of the hotel staff book a reservation for the brunch for us. We showed up Sunday morning at 11. There was a couple in front of us at the hostess stand. They looked a bit pissed, like they had been waiting for a while at the empty stand. Multiple staff members saw all of us waiting and said someone would be with us. After a solid 5 minutes the other couple left. The hostess did finally show up. We were then informed that Sunday brunch was no longer happening.  \"We can't support it this time of year\" was the excuse. It would be nice if someone from the hotel would have told us, or that you would put that info on your website. As of today it still says you are serving Sunday brunch on your website. We were too hungry to go anywhere so we stayed and ate. Service was crappy at best. Food was on par with any crappy hotel breakfast. Hash browns tasted like they had been sitting out for an hour. I can't see myself ever returning to this place.",

Did not expect much from the food and service but we were absolutely blown away.  Maxwell, our server, was terrific. Started with the complimentary focaccia w basil pesto dip.  Took Maxwell's recommendation and split a cup of soup which was amazing.  I think it was something like cream of turnip with honey roasted pine nuts (total guess but phenomenal).  Then we split the Garden Vegetable Salad which had a divinely light and flavorful dressing and crispy green beans, fresh corn, grilled halloumi cheese. Wow.  Then we split the short rib taco.  The filling was wonderful but it was the fresh corn tortilla that blew us away.  What a pleasant surprise and all for a super reasonable price and beautiful setting.  Definitely will be back and recommend highly.",

    "text": "There's been a long search far and wide for a Phoenix area breakfast brunch, and this was one of the places we've been eyeing for awhile. We figured anything that includes crab and shrimp on their menu had to be a pretty legit buffet, especially when you just dropped $500 to stay the night at Royal Palms Resort.   There are several options for the buffet. It starts at 10am. The website said that for $33 a person you get the buffet which included the seafood, omelet station, assorted pastas, salads, and desserts. I honestly thought there would be a meat carving station, but Alas! There was not.   If you get Buffet Option 2, you can have the buffet for $23 PLUS the price of a regular entree item. The waiter explained this to me 3 times. Possibly even 4 times...Almost to the point, where I wanted to say, \"OKAY! OKAY! I GET IT!!!\" He sensed my frustration and said that there had been misunderstandings before and he just wanted to make it clear. I understand too... my hubby were wearing workout type clothes since we had stayed the night on a whim and should've brought nicer attire for this brunch I guess... Regardless, my hubby did Option 1, the regular buffet, while I did Option 2 that was the buffet PLUS an entree.  The item that made Option 2 worth it to me was the Red Velvet French Toast. I absolutely adored this dish. Of course, it was sweet as sweet can be. The chocolate and maple syrup that came with this French Toast just made it \"all the more decadent.\" Had I known that I'd love this dish so much, I would've gotten Breakfast Option #3... Entree only.  The buffet itself was okay.  Things I thoroughly enjoyed: Mini flatbread pizza margheritta type slices drizzled with a Balsamic? vinegarette. Buffalo chicken, blue cheese, and celery salad. Very clever take on football appetizer on the day of the Superbowl, the morning we ate there! Omelet Station - overall pretty good. But even though the menu bragged Prosciutto as one of the omelet items - it was not available, so I went for ham... Panna Cotta dessert - rich and perfect texture Tiramisu - good stuff Pistachio dessert - it wasn't a cake but it wasn't a mousse either. It was hard to explain but perfection in every way!  We did not like the crab and shrimp station. The crab and shrimp had no flavor whatsoever, not even a seafood one. I might as well have been eating lumpy ice. Maybe that was the flavor? Freezer burn perhaps? I didn't even eat the shrimp ceviche either, because it seemed like the same crab and shrimp served plain. Usually I love crab and shrimp. There's a crab and seafood buffet in Portland, Oregon called Salty's that practically killed me because I swear I've eaten nearly 4-5lbs in crab alone, so trust me! I am not that picky about crab and shrimp. We were just so sad that it was so plain, especially at a 4 1/2-5 star resort.",

Our waiter, Anthony did a great job, he was humorous and gave great recommendations. I would 10/10 recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "Stayed at the Royal Palms (great resort!) so had the opportunity to try a few meals.  Dinner: I had the agnolotti, which was great, nice big chunks of lobster, and also the scallops. Priced as it was, I couldn't believe I only got four scallops, on a bed of mushrooms and corn. They were cooked well, but still, that's practically $10/scallop. We had the panna cotta for dessert, which wasn't a real panna cotta, but instead a bowl full of creamy dessert and some berries. Good, but not quite what I was expecting.  Breakfast: Amazing! Tried the granola, bread, smoked salmon bagel, eggs Benedict, fruit...A+++  Sunday Brunch: We had some amazing breakfasts at T. Cook's, so I was really, really, really disappointed with the brunch. I know brunch is usually a drop in class for any restaurant, but this was a precipitous drop. I opted for the buffet, nothing off the menu. Shrimp and crab claws that were just ok, stale olive bread, salmon that had been out for a little too long, and unappealing desserts--brownie and two little cakes were all sugar and I couldn't even finish them. Truly, the only food I actually enjoyed was the \"parfait\" (really just banana custard) and the jam, I think it was raspberry. I ate it plain because I did not want to chance another inferior bread item. Also, because of the busyness, service dropped off at brunch as well, so we were left sitting awhile for the check. $26 for this...not pleased.  Average of the reviews: 4 stars.",

I won't divulge everything, but from best seats to customized menus with our names printed on them to extra-attentive service, these guys were top-notch and caring.   The food was great too. From the warm bread with extra-parmesan-y pesto, to mussels and salad, to lamb and salmon, nothing let us down. Even the dessert was great. We got the $99 for two price-fixe-like summer special - app, entree + dessert.  It really is nice to know there is a place TRULY to take someone special for an anniversary dinner.   Tip - wander the grounds after and seek out hidden spots among the orange grove and gardens.",

Everything we ordered from the Christmas menu was delicious, but a few stand-outs are the crab cake appetizer and the beef tenderloin and pasta carbonara main dishes. The dark chocolate dessert (forgot what it's called) and the banana tart were my favorite desserts. I also LOVE the pesto that is served with the bread to start. I could eat that stuff all day long.  The restaurant has a warm and elegant atmosphere. The walk among the court yards and gardens is beautiful, especially since the weather was great this year. We decided to sit outside, which was lovely and extremely comfortable (not to warm, not to cool).   Highly recommend T. Cook's for a special meal with friends or family.",

Brought my mother-in-law for a brunch here with a plan to indulge, try as much of the new menu as possible, get her spoiled, get her pampered...as she deserves :) We have started sampling right away with 2 different specialty cocktails, moved to 2 different appetizers and 2 different entrees ... obviously we were there to stay for a while and to really enjoy. Food wonderful, service OK.... we were just starting to contemplate a sweet finish when the bomb arrived: \"Here is your check ladies!\"... we have literally just put our silverware down and the check was there already without anybody checking if there is anything else we might consider... I was so surprised that all I can say was...\"well, I would still like at least a coffee\". Purposefully I gave the waiter my CC right away (to the bill that he so promptly brought)... wondering how are they going to handle the \"additional cup of coffee\". The  waiter came and started to pour coffee to my mother-in-law, she stopped him, clarifying that she did not order any. My cup was filled... and again very shortly after  - to my surprise  - a new bill arrived (I have to admit I was totally expecting to have the cup of coffee complimentary -  after I have expressed my surprise of an early bill arrival) - well I was surprised even more when there were 2 coffees charge to my bill. I have decided to just go with it - payed my bill and left.  Also the new decor though very sleek and elegant, but can be found in any other new modern hotel (Westin style) - not reflecting the historical & cozy feel - that Royal Palms as a AZ landmark so uniquely represented. Multiple shades of brown and beige, no other color (remember the signature orange walls and the map on the wall in the bar with libraries filled with old books  -  making it one of my favorite spots in PHX - gone).  The only nice touch are iron wall dividers filled with candles and the \"smoking room\" still holds the \"old charm\". The bar enlarged (good move), but very mundane again - nothing to remind you that you are in one of AZ oldest mansions.... just another dark wood elegant bar you can find in any new elegant hotel.",

The whole evening was relaxed, unpretentious and lovely!  The crowd in the restaurant is a bit older, but foodies of any age will love this place.    So, we were a 12 person party, easily accommodated on big wooden tables on the charming back patio.  Our food was truly \"farm to table\" - the produce had been picked that morning!  A highlight of the meal was the cod, served with a chorizo cream sauce.  We also loved the two cheeses from the local Crow's Dairy.  The chevre was surprisingly sweet and mild, and the \"quark\" was almost like a custard.  Both were amazing.  The sides were uber-fresh veggies, simply prepared to let their natural flavors shine.  We also had a citrus brined \"Mary's Chicken\" dish that was one of the best grilled chicken dishes I've ever had.   I also need to give a shout out to the staff. They gave perfect service without being obtrusive.  They were also incredibly knowledgable about the ingredients in the dishes - which I love.  And, of course, getting a visit from both the chef and the pastry chef was a nice touch that our party really appreciated.",

    "text": "We were in AZ to celebrate our 5th anniversary, and chose T. Cook's for the occasion.  To start out, we had to wait a little more than 15 minutes for our 8:00 reservation. No apology, no nothing. It was puzzling, as there were many open tables. So things didn't start out on the best of notes.  Once we were seated, the service was excellent. The table was decorated for our anniversary, and our server was very informative. He also hooked us up with LOTS of extra wine, so that was a plus. But really, those were the highlights of our dinner.  I started with the crab cake, which I did not care for. It was very, very crispy/crunchy, and didn't really have any flavor. DH had the short rib ravioli to start, and it was also bland. The sauce was not to our liking either -- kinda tasted like the dark brown gravy you can make from an envelope. For entrees, I had the paella and DH had the duck. The paella was enormous. Seriously...could have been shared by 4 people. It was fine, I guess. Not horrible, but really not so great either. DH said he enjoyed his duck, but he is more easy-going than I am. I tasted it, and thought it was tough and flavorless. We shared some chocolate dessert, which was good.  I would probably give it 2.5 stars if I could. The atmosphere was really nice, the service was quite good, and my entree was okay. But if this is one of the best restaurants in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, I pity those who live there.",

This was my first time going for lunch- best cobb salad I have had in a long time, I will definitely be back again! The atmosphere is great during the day, too. Be sure to check out the Mix Up bar next to the dining room- it has such a cool vibe and amazing cocktails. Oh, and lobster corn dogs. Heaven.",

    "text": "We had dinner last tnight at the newly renovated T Cooks, We have gone there for years, was very disappointed in the remodel. All the charm of the original was gone. Looks just like any other chain resort. The most disappointing was the cheaplooking beams installed in the celing it look like a Howard Johnsons, very tacky, the beautiful tiles in the ladies room were all gone replace with everyday modern tiles. Not only was the decor and  atmosphere a disapointment. The food was worse,  things like vension and antolope really. We had the filet  and rosamary chicken  both very bland, even desert was not exciting.I am sorry this was my favorite place in PHX. But never more.",

    "text": "Two friends and I had lunch. Two salads, 1 turkey club sandwich, three iced teas, no wine or drinks, no dessert.   More than $ 75 for very poor food and poor service though the place was practically empty.  The sandwich had terrible grilled bread and tasteless tomatoes.  This once was a fairly good restaurant.  I will never go back.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I celebrated our 2 year anniversary at T Cooks yesterday and it was amazing!  From the moment you walk up, the place is breath taking.  Very relaxed romantic, we loved it!  The food was devine!  We started in the lounge where they run an awesome 1/2 off drinks and appetizers happy hour with the best poutine in town!  OMG I have no words for this heavenly couldron of hot perfectly cooked short ribs carmelized in its own jus on top of crispy french fries with some euro cream cheese!  God made that chef to make that dish- NO DOUBT ABOUT IT (and it's $7 during happy hour.)  We moved our way over to the restaurant which has a very upscale ski lodge feel to it.  COZY!  They knew it was our anniversary so they decorated the table with rose petals to make us feel special...and we did!  The chef sent us 2 glasses of champagne the moment we sat down, delicious and thank you!  Then on to dinner...He had the NY Strip, liked it, but he's always a bit of a critic.  And I had the seasonal paella.  A decision I was hesitant about right up until our lovely server, Candy, said those 2 beautiful words...pork belly.  That chick knew I was going to bite!  LOL.  It was thoughtfully cooked with hidden gems all throughout it.  Went for the lobster tail add on, good decision, and the only critisism I have is that I am still left with about 3 days worth of food from that dish.  It is a definate sharer, and when you go that route you and your date will walk away full and without breaking your budget.  2 1/2 hours into dinner and Vasil and I can't fathom eating another bite, but that sneaky server Candy knew we were in for the long haul and brought over the dreaded dessert menu.  A selection of creative, rich desserts that all sound so good, but then I see it... Caramel Cheesecake Creme Brulee...I AM IN!!!  Then our dessert menus were stripped from us and we were informed that the chef had something special for us instead...WHAT???  But the cheesecake?  Much to our surprise, the chef must have read our minds because he sent it to us!  Not to mention the decadent devil's food cake he also sent all playfully displayed on a beautiful plate decorated with chocolate to wish us a happy anniversary!  We did indeed have one.  Thank you T Cooks for an absolutely unforgetable evening and one we will struggle to ever top again!!!  You have a very warm and welcoming staff (special nod to Candy), an awe inspiring chef, and a beautiful and romantic restaurant.  Overall, one of the best experiences we have ever had and worth EVERY PENNY!",
