The delivery was on time  the food was hot and yummy  but they didn't include the FREE \"check in\" crab puffs or the 2 Flan we ordered. The  on the sundae is when I called the girl that answered the phone seemed annoyed and had a little bit of an attitude......it's just food. I don't understand why people in the food industry get an attitude about something that's very simple to fix. I suggest just calling in your order instead of using the Yelp app because apparently that's what they said is the problem.",

Cons: Too expensive ($18 for teriyaki chicken and hot wings?), other cashier was rude, wings were terrible with jagged bone shards, noodles had a weird smell like Windex but didn't taste terrible (worse than Panda, though, and that's a low bar), teriyaki chicken had the same \"discount meat\" taste as the wings, vegetables were soggy and mostly seemed like an afterthought.  Used to love this place but haven't been back in several years. This new bizarre menu seems to be an \"everything-kind-of-Asian\" mashup, food quality is poor, and it no longer has that small business charm it had before with previous owner, Tina.",

Although we only ordered 2 soups and a side of spring rolls, the two large families who placed their orders well after us received their food while we had still not been served! Finally, after my mom complained we were served the spring rolls and what seemed to be Wor Wonton Soup. After tasting a lukewarm soup, we noticed there were NO WONTONS! Only vegetables at the bottom of a large bowl of practically cold broth.   When we mentioned this to the server, she said she would 'go put wontons in it'. Still about 15 minutes after her taking back the soup, I had not received my order. We complained a second time, they were apologetic, however we asked for a refund on the two soups because we felt like dining elsewhere. NOT worth your money OR your TIME.   WORST customer service and neither of us will be going back.",

They have pictures on the wall that show exactly what you are getting.  Approximately 32 dishes. From Korean, Japanese, Thai to Chinese.  Reminds me somewhat of a food court type of restaurant.  During the week they have lunch specials.  Probably get better deals then.  We were here on a Saturday and prices were a bit high for what this place is.  I had the sesame chicken rice bowl with white rice (you have a choice of brown or white) with lots of chicken a couple of pieces of green and red pepper.  I believe I counted 3 pieces.  Little bit stingy.  Another person had the Pad Thai, and a Katsui chicken.  It's, clean, fast service, decent food.",

The staff apparently gave our order to a different guest because we received an order with chicken chow mein, orange chicken with white rice, and spring rolls. The price difference was about $0.20 less than what we paid, and although not a huge amount of money, I prefer to get what I pay for.   The food itself was below average. The chicken chow mein was bland. The chicken wasn't cooked poorly, but was certainly nothing to rave about. The spring rolls had more flavor than the chicken chow mein, but the sauce was a prepackaged sweet and sour sauce. I guess for 2.99 per 2 rolls I expected a little more. The orange chicken had better flavor than both the spring rolls and the chow mein, but the breading tasted like it had been fried in over-used oil. Most restaurants don't cook with high-heat stable oils and the batch should be changed regularly. Apparently Neo Tokyo doesn't extend this courtesy to their customers.   The incorrect and more expensive order, and the low quality, poorly seasoned food will keep me from returning here.",

Oh yeah, this is going to hit the spot!  You know when you're in trouble when you go in and the place is empty. Continuing in I saw udon on the menu board.. my cravings overrode my sensibility to leave, oh how do I hate my cravings. Got to the counter and couldn't stop myself.. order the shrimp tempura udon. After about 3 minutes later the smallest of bowls appeared.. can you call something this small a bowl, more like a bo since far to small to use the whole word.   Well instead of griping about paying 7 bucks plus tax for my bo of udon cravings took over again! I tried the broth first.. hmmm, pretty unimaginative.. for whatever reason I though it was going to be good, just salty.. the shrimp, gummy and soup logged.. okay here comes the udon!!! Like eating rubber bands.. tough, chewy and actually kind of strange. The only thing that was decent about the bo was these little pink and white half slices.. very chewy and pretty cool texture.. I would have rather had a bowl of those then anything else in the bo in front of me.   After about 5 bites I threw it out and left.. still craving good udon or ramen.. any ideas? Please!!!",

Stars- Two (I've had better.)                The wait for us was actually much shorter then what I was told, which was a plus. However, the food itself kind of lends itself to the old \"if you cant get flavor just use salt\" kind of mentality. While \"typical\" Chinese cuisine is salty this was more so then average. It is the only place that happens to deliver to our house but that isn't going to be enough to keep my business.  Entree breakdown  Egg-drop soup- Was surprisingly the least salty item we received and while it tasted a bit out of the norm for egg-drop soup, the green onion taste throughout was pretty good. I would order again.  Sesame Chicken- Very salty, taste was more of what i'd consider normal, again pretty much average.  Lettuce wraps(chicken)- The lettuce itself came wrapped in plastic and it still had its crispness to it ( a big plus) the chicken mix was pretty flavorful but we could only eat about half of one due to its extreme salty taste.  Fried rice(pork)- As a staple for me when we order any Asian cuisine fried rice can really make or break a place in my opinion. This was pretty average but I definitely ate all of it.",

Maybe because Im personally used to my mom's kitchen where we cook pho every week at home, so maybe you would like it. Service was prompt and friendly enough.  They offer one crab puff or one egg roll for free with purchase of $7 or more. But remember to redeem it before you get to the register because once you've paid for the food, they wont accept it. I purchased a $50+ lunch but got denied for one egg roll because i found the offer only after i settled down at the table waiting for our food.",

    "text": "I'm so mixed on this place. The food is always good, but the service varies wildly. I've ordered using the Eat24 app and had my food here within 20 minutes. I've also ordered, waited an hour, and gotten a call from Eat 24 saying no matter what they did they could not reach the restaurant - so no food, and they charged me. Recently, I called in to order (because of the Eat 24 issue) and said I would be paying cash. I asked for them to bring $10 change. The driver only had $4 on him. It's really frustrating when you tell them in advance how much change you need and they still can't pull it off. But hey, the delivery driver got a hell of a tip.   I'd love to this place to change management and get their act together. If they could consistently provide good service, they would absolutely be 5 stars. The food is always good. Their pad thai is tasty and not spicy. The ginger beef is delicious and the beef is tender, not chewy like most chinese restaurants. The lemon chicken, curry, and cashew chicken are all delicious. The portions are also nice - I usually get a solid meal and leftovers from a single order.  Update on 7/1 - The food wasn't great last time I ordered. The walnut shrimp was half the usual portion and very little sauce, it looked like leftovers from the night before. Considering how awful their service is, it's not worth ordering from them unless the food is damn good. They also would not honor the Yelp deal they advertise for a free sampler with a check in + like on fb. I'm removing a star. I order from them all the time, I should be getting great service.",

We had a few different dishes, and they were all just mediocre. Potstickers - fine. Lo Mein - fine, sort of boring (but not expecting anything too exciting from Lo Mein). Friend had Moo Goo Gai Pain, which she really liked. Overall I have had worse, but there is also better, and better in the area.

Mistakes happen, but I would have expected a better attempt at customer satisfaction.  They could have offered to make it again for me (and delivered it to my home), this time with the peanuts as required and a substitute vegetable of my choice to make up for the snow peas.  Nope.  Just excuses and an offer of credit for the cost of the peanuts.  They did not understand that I was TOTALLY UNSATISFIED WITH THE DISH, BECAUSE IT WAS NOT WHAT I ORDERED.  They were stuck on the cost of snow peas (which is why they run out of them from time to time, according to the person I spoke with on the phone) and the cost of peanuts (which they offered to credit me on my card).

The portions are huge, enough to feed 2 or left overs. I had the Teriaki chicken, it  was  so moist and flavorful! I guess this place is so well know, that when I came back to work the next day, my leftovers were swiped at work! I had a lunch date with my husband this afternoon to share this new little jem I found. I ordered the terriaki chicken again, we also ordered the walnut shrimp, the hawiann fried rice, and spring rolls. The shrimp is amazing, and I was impressed by the quality and quantity of the shrimp. The hawaiian fried rice was also impressive. I would ask to add more pineapple to it the next time, I feel that you can never have to much pineapple in your life! ;) Oh an the spring rolls, delish! Flavor, texture, and no grese in sight!  All I have to say is BRAVO Neo Tokyo, your food is truly PERFECTION, and  you have gained two new lifetime customers!!!",

I was very excited that my 8 week pregnant wife finally had an appetite, and she was feeling good enough to eat something.  The menu sounded very appealing and we were looking forward to trying a new place.   It took over 1.5 hours for our food to arrive (keep in mind we live literally five minutes away) and was ICE COLD upon arrival.  I called back and asked to speak with a manager, who happened to not be present.  I left my number and asked that she please call me back.  She called me back and said that she had spoken with the owner and they were willing to refund me if I packaged the food up, they would have the driver come and pick it up.  What?  No offer to replace the food, or deliver fresh...just a ridiculous offer to refund me ONLY if I returned the inedible food.  As I mentioned I have been a chef and restauranteur for quite some time and never experienced or participated in such poor customer service.  I am currently the Chef of Innovation for a very large multi national Asian restaurant group and can proudly say that our policies generally tend to favor our clients...the polar opposite of what we experienced this evening.  I can forgive the mistake of the cold food, but the mismanagement or lack of positive direction from the ownership is deplorable.  Save your time, save your money...support restauranteurs that support the community and care about the relationship they have with their clients.",

Our options were pizza, rubios or asian.  Grabbed a takeout menu and saw they had vietnamese, thai chinese, a little Japanese and korean. Clearly you can't be great at all of these flavors but we decided to order.  Walked up to the counter where we were greeted by a nice young gentleman named Mike apparently. Very good with customer service and asking questions as well as answering some of mine. Got pad thai with chicken and no peanuts with a side of kimchi. Hubby ordered shrimp pad thai. We used our check in offer for free crab rangoon.  Sat down and Mike brought our appetizer and kimchi first. Offered me chopsticks which I appreciated. Kimchi was fresh and very korean. Crab rangoon decent. Pad thai were great with lots of chicken and shrimp and flavorful cooked tofu.  Mike came by offering samples of Vietnamese coffee. Nice touch and tasted great. Pretty much full service except you order upfront. Nice comfy booths and tables with a couple tvs and outside seating.  We will be back!",

When i questioned the receipt that had $0.00 credited to my card, the Manager came over and did not even look at me and gruffly told the cashier, this is a credit.

I called the following day to tell them I felt I should get a refund, & they wanted me to bring it back. Their policy is in order to get a refund you must bring the food back! Why? Are they going to eat it? I'm not going out of my way to bring you back food, that ended up in the garbage! Seriously? Revisit your policy Savor Flavor ~. If you can't satisfy your customer- then your clearly doing something wrong in addition to making horrible lemon chicken & not refunding a customers money when it was the worst chicken I have ever had in a restaurant! Good luck - you don't care about keeping customers whatsoever! RESPONSE TO FLAVOR SAVOR: 9-4-2018 Hello Savor Flavor, Clearly you do not understand customer service! 1. Who cares what time I called the next day? Bad food deserves to be brought to the attention of the restaurant regardless of time. It was the next day, not the next week. (that was a ridiculous thing to say in response to an upset customer)... 2. I did not call in irate, I was very nice. It was only AFTER you asked me to bring the food back and did not offer to compensate me in ANY way if I couldn't bring back food that was thrown in the trash..(Another unreasonable thing to say to a customer).... 3. The reason for my review was due to \"how poorly you handled the situation\" and now all of Yelp can see how \"defensive\" your are..by making THE BAD FOOD, the customers fault, lying and False claims! What nerve! (shame, shame)  4. You never offered to \"comp\" me anything! Get your facts straight. 5. Your policy of taking an \"uneaten dish\" back, why? (to see what I experienced)?? How can you SEE BAD FOOD? If you can't believe that your customers are truthful get out of the business! It's called customer service and there will be times when something doesn't taste good OR IN THIS CASE WAS HARD AS A ROCK!  6. You policy will not keep people honest! I don't bother calling a restaurant unless there is a problem with the food.  This doesn't happen often, so when I do complain - THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT! DO NOT ACCUSE ME OR ANY CUSTOMERS OF FALSE CLAIMS!  Savor Flavor - your need to figure out that my review was spot on! Don't try to make it my fault, this was just another reason, I will never go back! Not only due to the BAD food, but to make matters worse you have HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE BY ATTACKING A CUSTOMER because they were upset they paid money for food that was HARD AS A ROCK & did not receive any compensation.",

I had the choice of noodles, white, fried or brown rice (extra charge). My bowl was delivered pretty quick, and the bowl looked almost exactly like the picture on the menu. Everything was very fresh and tasted good. My food wasn't spicy, but it did warm my throat. Maybe there is pepper on the chicken. I only mention it for those of you with younger folks who don't do any spices. The staff is so nice! The atmosphere is low key painted in mellow colors, nice decor. Seating is comfortable, and country rock track was playing. This is a pleasant place to eat. I'll be back.",

I found them to be the only Thai place in the area that would deliver so I decided to give them a try.   They had a pretty good array of Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese food. I ordered fresh spring rolls, chicken lo mein, panang chicken curry with brown rice, and spicy chicken wings. All of this came out to less than $30! Even better, my delivery arrived in less than 30 minutes.  I found everything to be super delicious! The rolls were tasty as well as the peanut sauce. The chicken wings were perfect, not breaded, just slightly fried, with a spicy and ranch sauce to complement. The only thing that I would add would be more vegetables to the curry and noodles. It he curry only had carrots and some onions. The noodles were just chicken and garlic.   If I ever need to order, I would again because of the speed, decent quality, and fair price.",

I asked, is this the dinner portion? \"Yes\" the server replied. Unfortunately for me the food was very good and I thoroughly enjoyed it but I was still hungry!

We ordered crab puffs, they were over cooked, actually dark brown/BURNT and NO CRAB, just cream cheese and didn't include nearly enough sweet and sour sauce. Next was the crispy pot stickers, wow, they weren't kidding with the word crispy. They were very over cooked, dry, bland and dark brown/BURNT. Then came the edamame, very rubbery! Seemed like all our appetizers were precooked and then recooked several times when they needed them. We also ordered orange chicken which arrived with VERY little sauce and SOGGY! I don't get it. All the item that were over cooked shouldn't have but the orange chicken that you want crispy, arrives soggy. The only thing that was done right was the prepackaged fortune cookies. Didn't even include napkins or utensils. CLASSLESS!!!!!! BIG WASTE OF MONEY!!!! Go to Panda Garden @ 48th & Warner instead. Much better food with owners who actually care about how their food is served! Foolish mistake on my part. NEVER AGAIN!!!! They will be out of business soon. Look at all their bad reviews in the last 90 days. DESPERATE and trying to survive their horrible food and crappy service!!!!",

When I arrived...~10 minutes later, there was still about a 10 minute wait.  However, first time ordering from here, was pleasantly surprised to see 6 customers eating in, 5 customers ahead of me...and another 7 that same in after I did.    I also over heard a customer in line complaining about the amount of time it took for delivery the last time she ordered....they ended up being 'dine in' customers this time.  The manager came out, to their table, to apologize for their sub-optimal [delivery] service experience, and that it is not usually the case.  Also mentioned that their busiest times were 7-8 pm, but should not have influenced their delivery service...but was extremely apologetic.  Not sure if they were 'compt'd' anything...and didn't mean to be nosey!  Over all ...first experience, therefore not justified in giving a 5 star rating because am unsure of consistency.  However, is above 3 star (average) ...which is what I was expecting.   I have rated it four star because when you walk in...seems like fast food...but a tad upscale from that in which you order, are given a number, and then served at the table, according to your number... (my order was pick up, but this is what I observed).    However, once I arrived home and experienced my spring rolls and chicken pad Thai .....YUM YUM YUM!!!!  Will do again!!!!!  If consistent in the product they deliver...and seeing the immense customer base...especially so early for dinner, will consider a 5 star!  But overall...YUM YUM YUM...at great prices!!!!!",

I got Kung Pao chicken the second time and was really disappointed. There were no red peppers that Kung Pao always has and it wasn't spicy at all. It was also greasy. I will probably give this place another try but get something that isn't supposed to be spicy.",

The food was prepared fast and was savory along with the lettuce of the wraps having a clean crisp crunch to them. Pricing is a little steep but not too bad considering the quality (way more fresh and better tasting than a panda express or other fast food chinese places). Apparently they will be doing some menu renovating soon but I hope that they keep the lettuce wraps and the fried rice the same as I will definitely be back for more.",

People expect this place to be like Panda Express because it's in a strip mall next to a movie theater. However their food is made fresh every day and made to order. So sometimes on the weekends when they get very busy orders can take 30 to 40 minutes to get your food But I promise it will be worth it. My favorite is the sesame chicken. But I also love the pad Thai and my kids love the Pho.",

After waiting for 15 minutes I asked the person behind the counter where my order was and was told they normally take 15 minutes to prepare each meal and mine should be up at any moment. I didn't quite buy that answer considering people ordered after me but got their food before me. I patiently waited another 5 minutes and once again asked where my food was. At that point the counter person grabbed my order ticket and went back into the kitchen and had the cooks gather up my food and put it into the to go plates. Apparently they completely forgot about my order. I finally ate my lunch and it was awful. All I could taste in the teriyaki sauce was black pepper. Teriyaki sauce is supposed to taste sweet not peppery. Overall it was a very bad experience. I was very disappointed. Don't think I'll be going back there anytime soon.",

Fast, friendly, and best of all THEY ACTUALLY DELIVER TO MY NEIGHBORHOOD (deep Ahwatukee). Prior to seeing a delivery car in my neighborhood, our only delivery options were: Dominoes. Yeah, just Dominoes.   Needless to say we'll be ordering a lot more Chinese than pizza going forward!   I'll mention they have more than just Chinese as well, with Thai, Japanese, and Vietnamese dishes on the menu!",

Their crab puffs are plentiful with the cream cheese filling and perfectly fried as were the chicken egg rolls. As for the sesame chicken It was deep fried as well and only a few chunks of peppers to color the plate, but the chicken was good sized chunks of white meat and the breeding was delicious.   Next time I would ask if they had anything on the menu that wasn't fried and included fresh veggies.   Suggestions: dress the plates better or not at all. If a person is eating in they shouldn't receive to-go packets of sauces. Also clean the floors so it matches the new clean looking tables & booths.   Good Luck Savor Flavor!",

I took a chance and I wasn't proved wrong in my previous statement. First of all the rice came on a paper plate and it looked like it was day old rice reheated in a loose pile.....second the \"panang curried beef\" came in a plastic container that looked like a repurposed salsa container. It was brown gravy like consistency with beef in it but almost nothing else. It was so friking hot that it was an obvious microwave job of previously cooked food. All this for 9 dollars. It didn't smell like panang it didnt look like panang. I took it back to the counter and the guy said no we cook everything fresh....funny thing is I look through the pass counter and see a whole huge sheet pan of cooked off breaded chicken in a rack. Do not waste your time and money on this place. I walked out disgusted.",

It really isn't very amazing here, its ok. If you're near the theatre, want to grab a quick bite before the show, and you are really craving some asian food, you could give it a try. Otherwise I'd just go elsewhere.  Staff is not very friendly at this place, I imagine its family run, but they seem like they could care less if you could eat here. I really don't like places like this that think they'll stay in business just because they got an awesome location. Aside from the person who takes your order, doesn't smile, and doesn't really say a word there is no service to rate here. The food isn't terrible, it just isn't amazing.",

I went for the Panang Chicken Curry... not too spicy which was good and came with some rice and they had a coupon in their paper menu's at the desk for a free chicken egg roll with an entree so that's what we did.  I'm no curry expert by any means but I've had better curry at Thai places previously but I wasn't disappointed at all.  I could have taken more rice but in the end it turned out to be just enough.  My buddy went safe and had the orange chicken which he said was just fine and he'd also return.  It's not a really nice place so no worries there, but not dirty at all, just kind of quick sit down and eat type place.. wooden chair booths but plenty of seating for a lot if you had a group.  Ladies were very nice and food came up fairly quick.  I'll go again and try another item on their menu and hopefully will be just as good or better.  Oh and they have Diet Dr Pepper, which is awesome... just sayin.",

The Kung Pao Chicken didn't taste like what it used to - it taste like Orange Chicken! It's sweet, barely spicy. So, I asked if somehow they got the order mixed up. Staff said \"different restaurants taste different\" and offered to fix it. Well, it didn't get fix. It still tasted sweet with the same sauce and all that was done was to add more spice to it. Well, I was just too hungry to complain any further. Besides, I sometimes do eat Orange Chicken, so I let it pass.  I've been to a lot Chinese restaurants and it's only in Neo Tokyo that I have encountered sweet, barely spicy Kung Pao... too Americanized for my taste.  Not going to eat there anymore.",

As for the restaurant itself the people are still very polite and helpful.  The decor is nice and calm and still looks very nice.  The menu change looks wise is nice they have gone from a cheap paper menu to a nice photo laminate tri-fold.    All and all I would recommend this place to anyone.  Only thing if the new management is listening to this sight for reviews please please bring back the sushi menu.  P.S. They Deliver.",

The fried rice tasted heavily of oil, and I could definitely make it better at home.  The only redeeming dish that saved this review from being one star is the sesame chicken.

    "text": "I was in the Tempe, AZ area earlier this week for work. Because my company considers traveling time as part of the work hours, by the time we landed and picked up a car, it was 11 am. Time for lunch.  My boss contacted his counterpart to let us know that we would be meeting up at Savor Flavor Asia.  Cool! Asian food for lunch. Looking good so far.  Damn GPS in these car rentals had us going around and around trying to find the restaurant.  I finally had to use Google map's street view to figure out where the heck the restaurant was. So we finally found it a block from the main street as the shopping plaza is over a 2 block area.  I get the concept of the restaurant. They provide a variety of the common Asian dishes for Japenese, Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese cuisine. And because it has some of my favorites listed, it took a few minutes to figure out what I wanted.  During this visit, I ordered the Katsu Don while my boss ordered the Chicken Curry.  My boss was warned that the spice level for the curry is 4 out of 5 and there is no substituting that. As my boss loves hot spices, he was very happy to hear that.  Now at the register, the veteran employee was training a newbie.  As my boss and I sat down and waited for our food, we of course struck up a conversation with my co-workers already chowing down.  In a reasonable amount of time, the newbie delivered our lunch.  My lunch looked more like chicken katsu rather than katsu don. As I asked the newbie, he confirmed it was what I ordered.  I took his word for it as I understand that sometimes restaurants will make things differently from what one is accustomed to. So I began to dig in and took a couple of bites. I thought that the katsu was good, along with the katsu sauce and the fried rice.  Oops! This is not what I ordered as I distinctly remembered that I ordered white rice. And my boss realized, he didn't order teriyaki chicken but curry chicken. So at least those two dishes were good.  We took our food back to the counter to let them know that the order was incorrect and unfortunately, we ate some of it.  We get back to our seats and within 2-minutes our correct orders were delivered.  Now Katsu Don is a little bit on the saucier side and is either a pork or chicken katsu mixed with eggs and onions. Normally, Katsu Don will come in a bowl so that the sauce can marinate into the rice. Unfortunately, my dish came on a plate and was a little too saucy for me. So instead of the sauce being on and through the rice, it was all over my plate. So my dish was okay. \"Can I get the incorrect order back please?\"  My boss also commented that his chicken curry was just okay. He felt that the spicy level of the curry was more a 2 rather than a 4.  Now for the atmosphere, nice, clean and modern decor.  And although our order came to us incorrect, I still think the customer service was great. In time, the newbie will be far better familiar with the dishes.  I do look forward to coming back because I do want to try the other dishes available.  Additionally, as I'm learning my way around the Phoenix, Tempe, Awatuke area, i find that I like the Awatuke neighborhood the best.  Sorry, no pictures of food while I'm work traveling as I really don't want to hear it from my co-workers or boss. I work with construction people. So I know the ribbing would be off the charts.",

I normally get the orange chicken and it's by far the best orange chicken I've ever had. And my coworker gets the kung pao chicken and she loves it as well. It's a lovely little restaurant with great hospitality. 5 out of 5 would definitely recommend.",

Got two orders of egg rolls and two pho. They have a self-service area to the left of the cashier's area which stocks chopsticks, sauces, and to go boxes. They had three types of tea at their drink station. Tried the passion fruit and it was good. The watermelon, not so much.   The eggs rolls were okay. Little burnt and they served it with a small amount of lettuce as well as mint.  The pho looked good but the soup lacked flavor. I found myself adding a lot of sauces to try and spruce it up. And more. And more. And more. I couldn't believe how much I had to add.  But I didn't hate it either. So, I can see us going back whenever we watch movies.",

Furthermore, the restaurant is clean and open, and a nice place to relax with your family. This is a local family-owned business and you can tell the owners and their staff care for their customers.

It was weird how while sitting in the booth, they brought our food out one by one, so the rest of us had to wait a while for everyone's food to be cooked.  Wontons were only good experience.",

It consisted of a lot of overcooked dry chicken and 4-5 tiny pieces of broccoli.  Even the Sriracha sauce was bland?? Not sure how that can be either. The white rice was good.  At least I'm full.

I like to mix it up with some gyoza and crab puffs from time to time, but I keep it pretty simple. That being said, I think you can judge an Asian place by its wok food like you can judge a steakhouse by its steaks.  Neo is pretty dang good. I don't like their crab puffs, but that's just me. Their gyoza are awesome, the wok food is good, and they offer brown rice which I think is really cool. The prices are very fair, and they have 24/7 coupons on their website.  I highly recommend you give them a shot, even if they're not the best Asian place in the Ahwatukee area.",

We are a family who loves all kinds of Asian food so we really wanted to like this place.  The kicker today was getting served fried spring rolls that were still very cold in the middle and quite soggy then a few moments later were were given a stack of plates one of which was very dirty.  There is no garbage can or station to throw away dirty items, we had a spill and after looking around, we hand the soiled napkins to the same person behind the counter who brought us our food moments later. Im not a picky eater and make the most out of anything, but out of the six items I've tried (we all shared our various entrees/family style) the orange chicken was the only thing I'd ever order a second time. They were out of their Vietnamese Pho soup by 1 pm....they have lots of dishes that *look* good, but something definitely  needs to change with their process or management.  If you must go, order the orange chicken and you should be safe, but don't expect your food to be very warm either.",

Both times we've been, Ive gotten the shrimp pad Thai which is pretty good portion size and does well in the flavor department. Most recently it was a wee bit on the salty side but we also ate immediately after it opened at 11am so that can always be risky in itself. My husband usually gets some sort of pho and enjoys the assortment of veggies and sauce options inside (left of register on a small table off to the side).   Staff is always super helpful and nice, we've never had a problem with the service :)   Quick tip: if you check in on yelp for the first time, you get a choice between free cream cheese wontons or egg rolls!!",

The noodles were COVERED in it and so the whole meal tasted like sweet goo. Someone needs to tell them easy on the corn starch! And I'm not sure it's even real chicken. It's probably pressed. Gross! The noodles also were too thick which was a gross combo with the thick \"sauce\".   If I ever crave crappy Asian food, I'll probably go there. Panda Express is better!",

I love the variety of options available, and they are willing to substitute veggies for anything that typically has meat, which is AWESOME for a vegan!  I love the pad Thai with veggies so much that I ordered it at my second visit as well! Next time I will be trying their veggie pho as I love pho. Beautiful environment and excellent service!   A special shoutout to KARA who is SO sweet, genuine and attentive to your experience. She truly goes above and beyond to ensure your visit is positive and I truly feel she deserves a raise!!  Excellent employee and they are blessed to have someone who cares so much. She's the reason I keep coming back.. the food is just a bonus!    I'll be a returning customer for sure! I have a 5 math old daughter and they are so sweet to her. The tables are stroller friendly so there is room to keep it with me, and the restroom has a Kowala changing station! NICE!! Thanks for making it easy for a mom like me to get out and about and care for my little one as conveniently as possible.  LOVE the Thai tea here! They also have other tea flavors available like blackberry and watermelon!  Be sure to check in and try either their crab puffs (awesome) or their egg rolls.. you can choose 2 of either. Thanks Savor Flavor for providing excellent service and wonderful food. I'll be back to see Kara!",

We shared an order of fresh spring rolls and an order of lettuce wraps.   The meal, overall, was light, enjoyable, and better than the usual theater snacks.   Pros: The counter service was prompt and courteous and the prices were on par for a restaurant like this located next door to a movie theater.   The portion sizes were good, all of the ingredients were fresh, the peanut sauce for the rolls was yummy, and the chicken for the wraps was nicely seasoned.   Cons: The spring rolls were mostly lettuce with three pieces of shrimp each and no pork slices.  Although the spring rolls arrived at our table fairly quickly, the lettuce wraps took about another 10 to 15 minutes at least.",

It ended up only being 30 minutes to wait. Both dishes came with rice and couldn't have been better! We both loved our dishes - it was exactly what we both wanted.

The beef broth might be from an instant mix, the noodles are thinner and lower quality and the meat cuts are pretty thin. However it's still pho, which I love, so when the wife wants to go here I'll keep getting it. I've found asking for extra green and yellow onions helps.",

This restaurant makes their chicken really good! It's crispy, not overly battered, and the sauce is perfectly sweet and lemony tangy. My coworker gets their Asian shrimp dish and loves it every time.

When I called because they were closing, she's say in a little nippy way to bring back and will either refund or new order. I was going to order again, but the girl get opens it looks at it and says there is no spice in this. I'm like pardon me?? I ate it and there is. What would be my purpose to bring it back. I would have eaten my dinner!! I said since I'm a lie just give me my money back. Now she's got to make a call???? Grrrrrrr. She doesn't apologize for me waiting, no explanation.

Good to see this place in business and providing good tastes and good value to its customers. Some complained about service, some about flavor, and still others about size of portions. None of these things were an issue for us. We had an excellent meal here that started with a fabulous Thai Iced Tea and Vietnamese Spring Rolls. Wow! The rolls could not have been fresher. The freshness was augmented by a slightly spicy peanut sauce. We thought they would be veggies with a bit of pork, but also had a piece of shrimp in each half of each roll. My wife wanted something crispy to eat. So she ordered the Orange Beef and I the Katsu Don Chicken. I'm not usually one for anything fried, but was intrigued by the description of panko breaded chicken stir fry. It and the sauce was excellent! The Orange Beef was also very good. Neither was laden with veggies, but the manager has explained the limitations of the American palette and their willingness to special order virtually anything the guest wishes. That's pretty amazing for a \"fast food\" style restaurant. In the future, I will take them up on that and order some specific veggies to go onto my dishes.  Bottom line, it is so nice to eat fresh, made to order food, nicely prepared and served at a reasonable price. My wife and I will likely work our way through this menu looking for favorites. But for this side of town, this is our new favorite place to go for Asian cuisine. Give it a try and support our local restaurants! We don't need another chain restaurant, do we?  Oh, and as far as size of the entrees? Both of us are good eaters when we are hungry, and we were. But neither one of us could finish what was served and now we have a nice take home box for a small lunch tomorrow!",

I checked this place out again after a few years of living too far to drive too and I am happy I'm now back close enough to enjoy it once again. From what I have experienced so far after several visits is this is NOT your standard Asian takeout, and I LOVE that about it. Normally I consider all Asian takeout pretty much the same, and I usually stick to my 2 or 3 \"goto\" items. Not here...so far anyway.   I met the new owner and his wife and asked what is good, and that's where it all started. They said they are enhancing the menu and adding a blend of Asian flavors, not just Chinese. They are both really nice and recommend something new every time we go. My wife loves the pad Thai and my new favorite is this yellow curry and rice noodle dish with veggies and chicken. I don't know the names of the stuff, but just point to the cool photos on the digital menu by the counter and go \"I want that one\" it's a cool change to actually see the exact item I'm ordering instead of just taking a chance on a dish I can't pronounce.   Anyway...I highly recommend this place! I haven't be disappointed",

I was starving, and theres only so many options one person has in regards to dining out on such a holiday.  The menus pretty boring, standard issue chinese.  Limited options, and a fast casual dining experience for service.  I don't think it was bad...just nothing really exciting here, and kind of has a boring feel to it.  I'm just glad that they were open to eat at during xmas day.  Food was okay, nothing exciting.  I went with the sweet and sour chicken with brown rice, and I got plenty of food for the $9.29 I paid.  Sadly, they serve everything on plastic, including the baby fork that came with my food.    Why cant I get real lifesize adult siverware here?  I swear the fork was meant for a 2 year old!    Of all the chinese places I've eat at, this was surely one of them.  Nothing memorable, but nothing so horrid that Im scarred for life.  Dont expect to much when eating here....",

I gave the place two stars because he let me go with the food anyways but of course he should have. I am just baffled a manager would suggest driving an extra thirty minutes back home (I let him know how far I lived) for five dollars because your employee miss stated the price. Lastly, not a huge deal but I asked from lots of extra sweet and sour sauce twice and of course had to go back in to get some as I got two packets for a three entree, two appetizer meal. Inompetence at its finest.  Lastly, the food is only worth 2 stars as it is simply \"just ok,\" if that even.",

She wants food that has no MSG, it cannot taste oily she likes brown rice not white rice and the food can't be too sweet.  Food must taste like food, not candy.  Most other places layer on the sugar, MSG and oil.  Every time we walked by this place it smells really good, so I finally convinced her to try it.  She went into her usual complicated requests, but the guy was very patient with her, took time to explain it's only a teaspoon of soybean oil he uses, and that his combination helps with the taste.  To exclude it totally, it would not be what she would like.  It went a few rounds, but she agreed and we got our order.  I was simpler.  Kung Pao and white rice.  I was told I could get fried rice, I appreciated that, but opted for simple white rice.  The chef/owner was very concerned and asked what we thought after our take out was delivered to us.  Well, we had got it to go, so could not reassure him as yet.  But I appreciate that he cared enough to come check if we were happy.  Got home, ate that stuff up.  Wife was very happy.  You don't know what a compliment this is.  She is so fussy.  Mine was very good too.  We both agreed we will go back and try some more.  If they keep up the flavorful, not oily, not too sweet and good size (Pei Wei gives you 2/3 rice and 1/3 food.  This was full food and a side of rice.), it could be a regular place for us.  I understand that Orange Chicken is suppose to be sweet, so when I try that, I will not ding them.  It's just that not all things are to be too sweet, and they seem to have that down.    GOOD JOB SAVOR FLAVOR!",

After noticing several patrons come and go I returned to the counter to check on my lunch order. It appears they had forgotten but would rush right through it. Several minutes passed and when I returned to the counter the your lady who had waited on me ran off to the back and never returned. Another person stood by then approached me. I asked for a refund which she all too quickly returned. I'm not sure customer service is high on their list.",

This was a weekly steeple for us when we lived in Ahwatukee.   The Orange Chicken is to die for. The fried rice is not your typical white rice crud you can buy from the neighborhood corner Panda restaurant. Their rangoons and egg rolls are also top notch for Arizona.   Overall, Neo Tokyo is a great find and place to eat. Truthfully, this is the first time we've been inside the restaurant and it's a chill, updated atmosphere. Would highly recommend eating here.",

I love the casual, clean atmosphere.  Other at the counter type service.  Both times I got the Chicken Pad Thai.  Yummy. Portion sizes were good.  I got 2 free chicken egg rolls with my yelp check in as well.  Love freebies.  They were yummy as well. I love that they have several flavored teas to choose from as well.  Tea is so much better flavored.  Healthier than Soda as well. I definitely will be back when in the area.",

    "text": "First off I was locked in the bathroom by a faulty lock. Was a small sticker sized notice that couldn't read without my glasses. Can we say fire hazard ?  I had to text my dinning partner to have a staff member get me out of there.   Next our appetizers came out , we ordered spring rolls and got egg rolls . I told them they gave us the wrong thing and  proceeded to say I didn't specify the right type of spring roll . She wasn't taking no for an answer , eat the egg rolls or go with out.   There is only 1 type of spring roll on menu . Since there is a check in offer for a free order of egg rolls , I wouldn't want it if you gave it to me for free. I shoved the order in the middle of the table and said I am not eating this, please bring me my spring rolls.  So they came back with 1 order of spring rolls, we had two.  So now we had to go to the counter to ask for our second order.They decided to short us one to make up  for the 60 cent price difference .  Told them to bring it out and we would pay difference .  After I walked away the girl behind the counter told her boss that we agreed to accept only 1. The boss, owner , or who ever he was wouldn't come up and talk to us .  He stayed behind he counter and looked at me. I assume the girl  who said we owed 60 cents more or we were getting shorted was related to him.The whole time they were making this our fault.  The order taker, when we placed the order repeated the order and said spring rolls. Next our meal came out . I had Korean soup he had cashew nut chicken. Neither had any taste . The broth was non existent. The rice paper on the rolls was so old it was tough and  partially uneatable. I couldn't teat it apart with both hands. We watched other people's  spring rolls come out . They looked fresh  and nicely presented. So we got thrown some old nasty rolls for \"ordering wrong \". Never coming back here again. Horrible service and horrible fast food .  Horrible management.I Walked out of there angry . Everything you ever wanted in a dining experience.",

The crispy beef was anything but, and so tough I ended up chewing the flavor (which WAS good), and spiting out the jerky-like mass after. THIS for 21.00 Do not bother!!!

I am never one to call and complain or someone who sends food back, but with spending $44.00 there was no way I couldn't say something. We ordered there special of 3 entrees that came with rice and egg rolls, crab puffs and Vietnamese coffee and sadly on 3 things weren't burnt. The crab puffs were ok, the white rice was fine and I still haven't had the coffee. Everything else was burnt and I mean burnt, the egg rolls were borderline black, the beef was burnt to a crips, the chicken seemed like it was sitting out all day then reheated to be burnt and even the lo mein was burnt. I've had over cooked noodles, but never burnt. We also paid the extra for the \"specialty\" lo mein and the shrimp I kid you not was the size of a dime and the chicken was no bigger than a nickel. Extremely disappointed, I couldn't even eat my dinner as hungry as I was. My boyfriend will eat almost anything and felt the same way.  We called to complain, again something I hate doing and the manager said he'd offer a refund but we'd have to contact Eat24. We contacted them and they were extremely helpful. They called the store and the manager told them he'd only offer a partial refund if they could pick it up. At the point I was beyond annoyed and told them to pick it up, which they never did and took the partial refund.   I'm seeing other reviews so maybe it was a really bad night for them, but the food was far from decent. I don't know if the cook was stoned and not paying attention or what the deal was, but I'll never order form here again unfortunately.",

Tasted like the chicken was grilled days ago and simply reheated.   Rice was good.  Then, they poured teriyaki sauce over the top like pancake syrup.  Awful.  The eggroll  not fresh either.  Hey, teriyaki chicken is hard to screw up.   In summary, the food is not fresh nor cooked today.  I have had better at Jack in the Box.  Arg!@!!",

    "text": "There's nothing to savor in this restaurant.  Their appetizer- Shrimp Tempura, expect 3 pieces of tiny FROZEN tempuras which is a total rip off. Their spicy Korean soup, yuck! I've tasted better INSTANT Korean noodle soup than theirs. I gave this restaurant a star since their Pad Thai was okay. Finally, after they serve your food, they'll serve your utensils...now your food is cold! Awesome!  But honestly, this is just a wannabe Asian restaurant. Never again! Money totally wasted...go some place else if you're looking for Asian food.",

Chicken LoMein, my favorite was delicious. The crunchy orange beef was good as well. The peppered beef was a bit tough but had good flavor. We will eat here again and I would recommend this food to others.",
