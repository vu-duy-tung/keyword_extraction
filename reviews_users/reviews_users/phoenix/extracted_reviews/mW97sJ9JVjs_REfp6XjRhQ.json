    "text": "I was delighted to see Raising Cane's near ASU as I have tried it before in Las Vegas and really liked the food. Normally I get either the box combo or the 3 finger combo depending on what I'm in the mood for. If it's your first time the box combo is a great sampler for their menu on what they have to offer. Given the proximity to ASU there are loads of college students that come through here but what I like is that they are open late which makes RC a great option for take out. As far as the food this is what I thought:  Chicken Fingers = Main reason for coming here in the first place. They are definitely above average and go well with the dipping sauce. Texas Toast = Nice and soft and I like the flavor. Coleslaw = It's just okay but goes well with the box combo meal. Nice to see some veggies though. French Fries = They are okay, just your average fries I guess. Keep in mind that they are crinkle cut instead of regular fries. Sauce = I'm a fan of the sauce but I do wish they have more choices of sauces in general, as this seems important for finger food.  Overall a great spot and despite being fast food I do like coming back here. The service is fast and the pricing for the combos is great value.",

It feels like they can't keep up with the crowd. You are easily the 12 th car in the drive thru. Today I went inside. They had one person taking orders despite a long line. When I finally did get my food everything on the plate was luke warm at best. The bread was ice cold. The chicken looked heat lamp burned. I NEVER take stuff back but I did this time because it just didn't look good. So I took it back. They made me another and were pretty cool with it. But finding a table was hard because they were all dirty. I worry this is what places will all be like as costs of operating keep rising. The people working looked like they were working hard. I didn't see any body just sitting around. I wonder if staffing is an issue. I will do other locations but I am done with this one.",

That being said, I was above and beyond disappointed to go in today and come to find that the sauces were downsized to almost half of the amount they used to serve. If you are going to have an added charge for an additional sauce then it should be an amount of that value. The food has always been great but I feel as though they are starting to care about saving the extra buck than providing the quality meal a customer deserves.",

One of my staple items at any restaurant is chicken fingers. They are easy to eat, they are fucking delicious, it's hard to fuck them up, they have a load of protein, and they are a vessel to get sauce in and around your gag reflex.  Which leads me to the problem with this dump: THEY HAVE ONE SHIT SAUCE.  The sauce is not spicy, it's not ranchy, it's nothing you want in your mouth.  It might just be some salad dressing.  The texas toast, again has no real taste.  Chicken = ALSO Bland.  I've had bowling alley chicken fingers that are better than this.  Who the fuck has crinkle cut fries Cane WHO.  Crinkle cut fries? FUCK OUT MY FACE.  I'm never going here again. Go literally anywhere else and you'll get better chicken. I resorted to using leftover McNugget Buffalo sauce that I thankfully had in my fridge, or I would have had a rough night.  I did eat all of it, dissapointed, but hey I had to eat. So 2 stars for being better than something I would throw away immediately. GOOD JOB.",

I ordered the Box Combo: 4 Chicken Fingers, 1 coleslaw, 1  Texas Toast, Fries, and a drink. The food came out in less than a minute, which dazzled me.   I sat down and began my meal. First, the TOAST! My new favorite! The Texas toast was amazingly soft and incredibly tasty. The french fries were good, as well as the coleslaw. As for the chicken, it was juicy and tender.   Overall, the food and combination was GREAT. Will come back!!",

If you are new to cane's the simple question to answer is can you eat chicken? No? Sorry, you're unlucky. Yes? Run, don't walk your way here! Chick-Fil-A can keep the chicken sandwich, these guys invented the chicken finger! Just get three things: chicken fingers, sweet tea, and sauce. The fries are ok, so is the toast, but really everything here is just filler. The sauce should be tested it's that addicting it's a little warm but not spicy and the sweet tea might be liquid sugar, but no part of your tongue will care. The chicken itself is juicy and will not last. Within minutes you will have a \"i ate the bones\" moment.  Faults? Price. After tax I spend around nine dollars which is a different tax bracket compared to most fast food, but it's a great occasional guilty pleasure.",

    "text": "I have to admit that I spent every summer in Baton Rouge, Louisiana growing up. The memories of those humid days evading alligators and going to jazz festivals always peak with my favorite part of every visit: Going to the Louisiana State University marching band fest and the greatest dinner afterwards. My late great Uncle always made sure to include Cane's in his tour of the city because it had so quickly become a local favorite among students and the city folk. Cane's is the coolest campus food, and the owner's story is motivational for any university student. Honestly, this has always been my favorite fast food place, and I was so excited when I first saw the coming soon sign just East of University and Rural that I nearly crashed my car.    Much like In-n-Out, the beauty of the 1 Love Menu is in it's simplicity. Perfectly breaded, seasoned to brilliance chicken fingers accented with a Texas Toast that those two words don't even begin to describe. This lightly buttered, pillow soft in the middle, hearty pretzel crunch on the outside toast will have you ordering two, maybe three more before the end of your meal. And don't be fooled, that Cane's Sauce is perfect for dipping Chicken Fingers, French Fries, and your delicious Toast.  And on the French Fries, they are the only subpar piece of the meal. Simple crinkle-cut fries which seem to be perpetually undercooked don't ruin the box by far, but it's something that at a national level they could fix. This phenomenal box is topped off with the finest fast food cole slaw, and is only perfectly matched with an in house made sweet tea.  Our local Cane's has definitely kept up the national reputation I have come to appreciate so much. Staff is the friendliest in town, and the one time my food took more than ten minutes to be brought out to my seat, it came out with a gift card for a free box combo next time I visited, directly from the manager. With service like that, the Taco Bells and McDonald's of the world are being left in the dust.  This is the franchise of the future, and I'm happier and happier with every single visit. No where else in the valley are you going to find such a great value for your budget, and that's what keeps me coming back.",

The guy was the one calling orders that were ready and this other girl at the register finally realized I was standing there so she asked if I needed assistance. So then I asked the girl my question and before she could even answer the guy answered me instead but with a very rude tone. I wouldn't have mind paying an extra 30+ cent nor getting back in line, I just didn't appreciate that I was completely ignored when he definitely heard me ask a question. Also instead of just looking away he had to stare at me, let me stand there and look stupid. On top of that if he didn't want to answer me for any reason the first time why did he have butt in when someone actually wanted to help me. I made sure to ask politely since I was completely lost and wasn't aware what I was supposed to do so I didn't want to make it sound like they did anything wrong but yet he was still rude to me.

    "text": "Going to college in Tallahassee, the one spot that was a winner for everyone was \"Guthrie's of Tallahassee\"... Same style menu & the staple of a college meal here at Raising Cane's. Even more fitting that it's near ASU Campus. Chicken Fingers, Fries, Texas Toast & coleslaw (swap-able). Granted, it's a chain with locations globally I believe, but it still provides that same level of comfort I had back in school... A simple and great tasting meal!!!  Its a basic concept & they keep it simple. They sell chicken tenders and that's what I like about them. Expanding the menu to do \"too much\" would take away from things, so hopefully they keep it simple. If ur a dipping person like me, order an extra sauce or exchange the coleslaw for another item like toast!",

What they do is is go the extra mile with great in house made lemonade, and sweet tea. I have experience in multiple states with this business and they are always a savvy choice.   They would have received 4 stars but this is not BATON ROUGE, this is TEMPE. And we have our own chicken  finger spot. Rock and Roll chicken fingers is a Tempe original, one man small business that does chicken fingers better. The famous Canes sauce, and even the Honey Mustard are the same and this guy has been doing it longer (and better, in my opinion). His fingers are slightly pricier, but much bigger. Hard to finish the regular plate in one sitting. The kicker? This guy will do them buffalo style!   So if your in Tempe, support the little guy. Not this growing chain. You wont regret it.  If your not in Tempe, go to Cane's.",

We ordered a couple Box Combos from Drive Thru and when we got home after eating some of the food, I broke one of the chickens apart and found a 4 inch Black/Silver hair stuck inside of the breading of the chicken  I'm not sure what has happened to the quality of Raising Cane's but it seems that as they have grown, the quality has become less focal. At this point, I don't care to go to another Raising Cane's bc it's happened at multiple locations and I feel as if it's possible to happen at any of them.

I've been wanting to try Raising Cane's for a while after hearing the teenie bopper at work rave about it on and on.  After losing $15 in Bingo, we decided to swing by to soothe our aching hearts and rumbly tummies.    When we first walked in, the place was desolate with the exception of a few tables.  After we sat down and were waiting for our food, the place got busy.  There were four combinations to choose from and a kid's meal as your options.  I chose The Finger Combo since I'm not a huge fan of coleslaw.  I got three chicken strips, crinkle french fries, and Texas toast with my meal.  The chicken was pretty good!  Great flavor, I like the breading, but they were a bit small.  They give you Cane's sauce for dipping them in which tastes mainly of mayonnaise, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce.  NBD, why is everyone freaking out over the sauce?  It tastes kind of like Thousand Island dressing.  I was later told by my brother that I should have asked for gravy.  Mmm, gravy.  Anywho, the fries were okay and the bite of coleslaw I yoinked tasted decent as well.  I'm loving that Texas toast too!  Don't park east of the restaurant because this place gets crazy busy and the drive-thru line could block you in.  All in all, it was decent eats.  But $6 for three tiny chicken tenders?  Come on!    \"I want to be strapped to a table, while a family of chickens argues over who gets to eat my legs.\"",

I call the Cane's location. I talk to the manager named Steve. I threw out the receipt walking out of Canes because I didn't expect to not get CHICKEN, the main part of a Canes meal. He said there's nothing he can do without a receipt. So we drive all the way back to Canes, a 15 minute drive. We show the lady a bank statement that we just got Canes. She says \"Next time we cannot accept a bank statement we only take receipts\" We did no receive 1 apology from anyone. They're the ones that fucked up our order. They did not offer 1 single apology and did not care at all. Never returning to this location again, And I will be forwarding this to Corporate. Im not upset they messed up my order. I'm upset they did not take ownership and did not apologize for doing so and that they did not offer to fix the problem.",

They're lightly breaded and are served with fries, garlic toast and a tiny side of coleslaw. There's only one type of dipping sauce for the chicken strips (Cane's sauce), ketchup for the fries (unless you put ketchup on your chicken).    Overall it's good but I can't see myself craving it. I think I prefer Popeye's, but because I like the spicy chicken and a better sauce selection.",

I was totally blown away by how yummy the chicken is! Their menu is small at I believe four combos, plus a couple of kids options.  The chicken is tender and juicy and I don't know what their secret sauce is made of but it must be from heaven.  I can't wait to go to Canes again. I would venture to say that if you are craving Canes, go early because while there wasn't a wait for us, quickly a queue formed inside AND out! I guess everyone else likes Raising Canes too!",

    "text": "Raising Canes has two fatal flaws that prevent it from being something truly enjoyable for me. The first being the pedestrian cafeteria style crinkle cut fries. Today my fries had a horrid stale oil aftertaste. Canes needs to do something about their bland fries, maybe take a page from wing-stops book and season them and upgrade to a skin-on frozen fry or even cut their own in house. I think the fries are nasty and generally not worth the calories.  The second flaw is that the menu is completely boring. There are no flavors of chicken fingers to chose from so you are forced to order them plain. What about a seasoning rub? What about dipping them in sauces? You may have 1 love and primarily focus on chicken, but why not offer different presentations of your flagship item?  Cane's gets credit for dealing with a perpetual flow of student eaters and gets your food out hot and fast every time. Still, I can't eat here often not because I can't afford it but because the calorie content is super high. Today I wished I spent those precious calories on something with a big more flavor. That, and each combo box is $1-2 overpriced, $9.80 for 6 fingers? whaaaa? Next time I will order them a la carte and skip the fries, slaw, bread, and diabeatus tea.",

Coleslaw is great. The crinkle cut fries are hot and crispy and  only good if you dine in. They will get lukewarm and weird if you do take away. The Texas toast is great. It should be toasted a little longer to get more crunch but the taste makes up for it. Also, the fresh squeezed lemonade is great but they charge about 20 cents extra for it and you have to pay for refills, which I hate doing. Other than the minor flaws, this place deserves a 5 star rating. Very pleased every time I come in.",

So park away from the building!  As far as the food, like I said - it rocks. Good grub and their \"Canes Sauce\"  is bomb. The coleslaw however is WACK. Watery and bland. I always just tell them I don't want it so I don't have to waste food by throwing it away.  The bathrooms at this location are usually dirty due to the dorm-room manners of their ASU patrons and the dorm-room work ethic of their ASU staff. When I bring my kids in for a bite, especially my 3 y/o princess, it sucks to walk into and attempt to help her use a nasty bathroom.

    "text": "Raising Cane's on University: Best chicken fingers in the game Food/ pricing  You better like chicken fingers when coming to canes because that's pretty much all they serve. But when it comes to chicken fingers, they definitely know what they are doing. The menu consists of 3, 4, or 6 chicken finger combos with Texas toast, coleslaw and French fries. The only other item on the menu is the sandwich combo with 3 fingers. Every time I go to Canes, I order the the 4-piece box combo. The box combo is served in a Styrofoam box with easy to-go take out opportunity. The chicken fingers have a southern seasoning with just the right amount of breading. Also, their lemonade is outstanding. The averagely salty French fries and creamy coleslaw are whatever, but the Texas toast is out of this world. People dislike the French fries in other yelp reviews but I find them to be salty and tasty. The 4-piece combo will run you about $8. For the value there is nowhere better to go. But as for the limited menu, healthier options like a side salad would be happily welcomed. Note* coleslaw may be substituted for an extra Texas toast. (not known by many people)   Atmosphere  Cane's atmosphere is all about Arizona State University. the restaurant is decorated with ASU logos and \"Go Devils\" throughout the store. With plenty of seating, I never find myself waiting for a table. The drink machines are self serve besides the lemonade which requires a cost to refill. The regular chairs and tables are comfortable for a nice sit down meal. All of the surfaces are clean and sanitary. Male and female bathrooms are present and always clean. Cane's employees are always wiping down tables and other surfaces customers regally touch to ensure regular cleanliness.  Service Cane's service is on point. Once you order and sit down at a table of your own choice, your meal is delivered to you personally. The server calls your name and the food is brought to you. The server always asks if you need anything like ketchup, which is always a nice touch. As a regular customer I am never disappointed by the service. The restaurant sits on one of ASU's busiest corners so I never find myself disappointed waiting a few extra minutes for food. Lunch and dinner time are usually packed with people trying to get their chicken fingers. Also, late nights after 11 are also super busy because of college students. The drive through line is super convenient but usually takes much longer than getting out and waiting in line. If there are less than 10 cars waiting in the drive though lane, I'll usually go inside. If you are looking to eat some great chicken fingers and Texas toast around the ASU school area, Raising Cane's should be your go to! All in all, Cane's is one of Arizona States student's favorite restaurants and everyone should go check it out.",

People can disappoint you, but Cane's has never let me down. I talk about this chicken restaurant incessantly, and even have a Cane's t-shirt. The sauce is delectable, the toast is to die for, and the chicken is by far the best fast food chicken I've ever had. Should I get another bachelors degree at ASU just so I can eat at this canes location? Probably. #canesgang",

When prompted to pay at the window, we had the girl re-read our orders (initially putting the 2 orders together), which she read correctly the second time. I know drive-thru can be crazy at times with so many orders coming through, but it's a little frustrating when you don't get your extra Cane's sauce you pay for and when your friend doesn't even get a Cane's sauce with her combo meal :/  Definitely going to In-n-Out next time",

The sauce is awesome the crew is always dressed super sharp, from the moment they great you when you enter to having them walk around and check on you during your meal if you choose to dine in is five stars in my book. You can make Arnold palmers with the awesome lemonade ice tea combos, and the fries are always crispy at best. If you ask them for a canes card at the register you can sign up for the Candace club and receive awesome rewards like free meals and drink.",

Good with or without the cane sauce.  But the cane sauce takes it over the top!!!  Meals come with crinkle cut fries are lightly salted and crispy.  And don't forget the Texas Toast.  To me this is my favorite part of the meal.  I can't explain it but I love it and sometimes even order an extra.  Gotta eat it warm though.  Go at it first cause it will give time for the chicken and fries to cool as they just came out of the fryer.  I top this thing off with freshly squeezed lemonade.  The family likes the tea but I don't mind paying the extra for the sweet tangy lemonade.  Don't go to any other chicken finger wanna be restaurant.",

I've also eaten at the one in my hometown of Covington, LA. But today was my first day eating at a Canes outside of Louisiana, and all I can say is that it was A LIL' TASTE OF HOME! I relished the Cane's chicken, perfect fry batter, Cane's sauce, slaw, and Barq's rootbeer. BTW, Barq's originated in Biloxi, MS, which is on the Gulf Coast. The Texas toast is perfect, but I've never cared for their crinkle fries. They're pretty cheap. They taste like the Walmart \"True Value\" brand of crinkle fries. No joke. Other than that, I highly recommend Cane's. If you only eat three things, eat this: Barq's Rootbeer, slaw, and a lot of chicken with Cane's sauce. Southern people know how to eat!",

There is only one thing on the menu and that is chicken fingers, and boy do they know how to make good chicken fingers! The chicken is high quality and not overly breaded. There are 3 sides to chose from: slaw, texas toast, and fries. The slaw is alright but if you are not a fan you can replace it with another toasts or extra fries (highly recommend this). The texas toast is from another planet good! It is always toasted to perfection and lightly buttered. The fries are crinkle cut and always cooked nice and crispy. (I have had better fries in my life but these aren't bad).   Now let me tell you about their cane sauce. I really have no idea how to describe it other than it is the best dipping sauce I've ever had. When I first went there I was disappointed to find out that they didn't have ranch for my fingers but once I tried this sauce I was hooked. I get cravings in the middle of the night for this stuf! Which lucky for me Raising Canes is open until 12 every night and 2am on Friday and Saturday.   The staff is always incredibly friendly (sometimes too much so). If you are in a sassy mood and don't want perky, happy, smiling people around you don't come here. There are lots of boths to sit in, which I love. It is an awkward layout for big groups though.   Awesome place! Great food and great service! Just don't forget to substitute the slaw for an extra toast or more fries and you are set.  *The drive thru isn't super fast because they cook to order the chicken. *They only have one sauce option (that I LOVE) but I could see kids not liking it",

Of course, you also always need to buy an extra Cane's sauce, so your not skimping on your dipping. Great sweet tea too!",

You can substitute the sauce, the toast, and the coke slaw for other items.  The service today was quick. A guy who I thought was the manager was helping pick up baskets and clear tables to help keep everything moving. The only downside today was that I thought the chicken fingers looked smaller than usual.  I like that this restaurant generally provides a quick and tasty meal.",

I've been here more times than I can remember, and here's why: cheap, delicious, piping hot chicken fingers and fries (and not to mention, the to-die-for Cane's sauce)! It's pretty much always packed, but this location is well-staffed and they can definitely handle the rush. Everyone is very friendly and looks out for each other and the customers. Definitely recommend this place!",

    "text": "If you want quick and tasty breaded chicken fingers this is your place. Whenever I'm in this shopping plaza there always seems to be a line for the drive through so I figured this place must be doing something right to have that much business! We decided to eat in for our first visit and entered to smell the appetizing scent of fried chicken. The menu is very basic and consists of primarily individual combo meals or large party packs. While this does cut down on ordering time I would like a more convenient option for a chicken only package that doesn't feed an army since it seems you can only order by the piece if you want just chicken with no drink or sides.  I went with the 6 piece combo. The sides are already determined for you and are Texas toast, coleslaw and fries. It was ready only a few short minutes after we got our drinks and sat down and were piping hot. The chicken was a large portion, tender, juicy, with a crunchy crispy breading. The breading itself was well executed but a bit plain as I needed the special sauce on the chicken finger to add more flavor dimension to my meal. The sauce itself was pretty tangy/vinegary but had a creamy component to it as well. It was alright but after a while it was too one dimensional of a flavor for me.   Unless I missed it on the menu I didn't see any other sauces available other than the ketchup at the counter for the fries. I really would have liked some hot sauce to go with the chicken fingers instead of the creamy vinegar tasting sauce.   The fries were crinkle cut and plentiful. The coleslaw was cool and refreshing but a bit bland tasting to me. The Texas toast had a salty buttery outer layer and was pillowy soft on the inside.   Drinks are self serve and the options are sweet tea, unsweetened tea, and Coke products.  Service was fast and friendly.   For what it is, a fast food chicken finger place, this restaurant delivers just as it advertises. While I do prefer other fried chicken places better, you can't deny the quickness and efficiency of Raising Cane's!  3.5/5",

    "text": "I love that Raising Cane's is one of the handful of restaurants that offers a military discount. My mother is an Air Force veteran, this is one of her favorite places to eat out on her limited budget. My mom and I have been going to this location ever since it opened, never had a problem until last night.  The restaurant was extremely busy because apparently an ASU game had just finished. My mother is elderly, and partially disabled, so not always steady on her feet or quick to move. There were so many people packed in the dining area that she was not able to easily make it up to the front of the restaurant to accompany me to place our order. As we have done in this establishment and many others, she took a seat near the back where we had entered while I went up to place our order.  My mom handed me her military ID card and I proceeded to get in line. The line moved quick and when I was called up I told the employee taking orders right off the bat that we had a military discount. She took a look at the ID card and said she couldn't honor it unless the person whose name was on the card came up to the counter. I explained to her the situation and that my mother was with me, just sitting at the back of the restaurant if she'd like to take a quick peek. I was told that her manager probably wouldn't allow that because the person who is receiving the discount has to stand at the counter and place the order themselves. I told her I was very surprised that we had never had an issue like this before, and that we come inside and go drive through and no one has ever told us they would not extend the discount considering my mother is actually present in the restaurant. She said that was just the way the policy worked and she wouldn't extend us a military discount. So we decided to go elsewhere.  I realize that the military discount is intended for military personnel and retirees. There was no attempt on our part to cheat the system or circumvent the system, we just had an issue of a person who has difficulty moving around in a busy crowded environment that needed to sit a short distance from where your registers were located. It's not just that it was an inconvenience for your employee, but the fact she wasn't even pleasant or willing to try to understand the situation that really made this terrible.   If your employees don't want to extend the military discounts, and have no ability to comprehend how challenging it can be both for the disabled and the elderly, I think some retraining is due. I know it's easy to overlook the challenges faced by the older generations in our country when you are a college student, but we all get there eventually. Everyone reaches the end of the road the same way, so I hope that when your employee gets to be my mothers age, that she is treated with just a little more understanding and compassion than what we received last night.",

I'm sure many people who have been going to Raising Cane's can agree.  -Multiple locations we've found hair inside the chicken..GROSS!! There's other reviews that says the same. I have not once seen the workers wear hair nets. -As well as the temperature of our food, I wouldn't say our food would be cold but it wouldn't be a warm temperature to even eat.   - LINES FOR DAYS! Please be warned if you're dinning in, make sure you're no where parked by the entrance. The line will box you in and you will have a hard time backing out.",

It's down the street from me so we go in a couple times a month, this location is just as clean, well kept, and fast as every other one I've visited. This location is a little bit busier than most though so the lines are a little long, but given it is near the Tempe ASU campus, it will be busy almost throughout the day.  As for the food itself, it's very tender battered and fried chicken fingers, lightly seasoned with a superb 'secret' dipping sauce on the side (you can find the identical recipe on Google or YouTube lol), with a side of coleslaw,  and buttered lightly browned Texan toast, you can ask to replace any of the sides with the another side. The ice tea is great, I get the sweetened version and it's fabulous. Not much more to say than that, the menu is small, but it's good comfort food (:",

A typical box consists of Chicken fingers,crinkle-cut fries,cane's sauce,coleslaw, texas toast and a drink. They are definitely superior to your average fast food,the buttery texas toast alone keeps me coming back.It's a good size sesame seeded bread. The chicken fingers are tender, flavorful and go well with their Cane's sauce.I'm not a fan of the slaw.  Another plus for me is that they stay open until 2:00 am Thursday through Saturday. The drive-through is quite fast considering it's always swamped.  Cheers!",

In short, they're a lot like the In-N-Out for chicken fingers, except more expensive.   There are three main combinations to choose from - you can have either a three, four, or six-piece chicken fingers box, and each comes with crinkle fries, toast, coleslaw, and a drink (ranging from $7-$9). You better like chicken fingers if you come here, because that's the only choice in chicken that you can choose from.   The food itself was tasty. Nothing too special, but it definitely fills you up. The Cane's Sauce didn't taste much different from Thousand Island dressing, but after doing some Googling, it looks like they make it themselves with just a few super simple ingredients. The chicken also tasted really fresh, and the toast was delicious.  Overall, the place is okay, but I wouldn't travel out of my way to come here. If you're wanting some tasty chicken on a Sunday when another major chicken chain is closed, you'll probably enjoy this place.",

I'm generally very health conscious and not a fan of fried food and wouldn't go out of my way to eat it either. But we were close by and I really wanted to know what the deal was with this place.  The inside looks very nice. It is clean and has an appealing decor. The menu looked very simple, we ordered two of The Box, which comes with (I think) 4 fried chicken strips, cole slaw, fries, a buttery toast, and a special sauce.  The chicken was good, the meat inside actually looked and tasted like chicken. The sauce had interesting flavors. I really liked the cole slaw though, and the toast... I think totally unnecessary and just adds more carbs to the meal. They should offer some healthier options to that, maybe some apple slices or a side salad? The overall experience was very pleasant.  As I said, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go and eat there but I would definitely let friends peer pressure me in going :)",

Admittedly, the chicken sandwich (made of 2 giant chicken strips) was huge so it was a good value..  I also ordered their kids meal and a chicken strip combo meal.  They were huge portions, Coleslaw was tasty, but I didn't care for the sauce or the crinkled french fries.  We had leftovers.  The lemonade was great.

The dining area was tidy and alive with customers, mostly college aged. The motif reminded me of the local Pizza Hut with ASU sports memorabilia and movie posters. The bathroom also looked clean.   I ordered The Box combo. It was good! The chicken a combination of 20% crunchy and 80% tender, decent fries a side order of favas beans and a nice Chianti thfhtftfth!!! (Just joking; movie references!). The dinner was good; a fellow Yelper mentioned I should've tried the sauce; I did as it came 'on the side' along with my cole slaw. The sweet tea was good, too.    The location was busy but parking wasn't impossible. I may not visit this one again (only because it's smack dab in the middle of busyness) but Cane's is worth a second visit...I'm looking forward to it!",

I ordered the 3 tenders meal and with tax, it came out to 7.58. The meal comes with fries, toast, tenders and a drink. It is the perfect amount of food for me and it leaves me feeling satisfied. The service was alright but the employee who pushed out the order was great!   I don't here all the time because, healthy is wealth, but it's always makes for a nice treat when I do get it!",

Went to this location while traveling since they don't have this chain on the east coast.  Unfortunately they didn't give me any dipping sauce so I had to go back but they gave me a free comp meal. So I'm adding astar for the good service. Toast was pretty good. Fries were average quality. Tea's not bad, I like that they use real cane sugar.",

However, Canes's only has chicken tenders. Even their sandwich is made with their strips.   The Cane's sauce is a nice Cajun style homemade sauce that pair perfectly with their tenders.   I typically pair my canes with an Arnold Palmer however, the lemonade is pretty good on its own too!",

The cash register was very nice and polite and listened to my dad's silly jokes (which weren't very silly) but she still laughed. My family and I tried to find a place to sit but all the Tables were dirty so someone wasn't doing their job my father asked someone to please clean our table so the employee did as told. Our food arrived the chicken was moist, crispy and exceeded my expectations the toast was average but I didn't mind the sauce was good but the fries needed a bit more seasoning but were good anyways and I left a happy customer so next time you go to canes get the lemonade.",

That's fine, let the employees enjoy their holiday.  Yesterday I was nearby again and they were open.  I opted for going inside since I wasn't sure about the ordering process.  I told the kid at the counter it was my first time and he showed no emotion.  So I decided to go with the biggest order of 6 tenders.  I was waiting for questions as to what else I wanted and nothing.  It was like I was supposed to know what to tell him.  Finally I asked him if there was a side selection and he said no.  It's french fries and cold slaw.  There was an issue with what kind of  dipping sauce I wanted.  I got 2 but I could not have 1 cane sauce and 1 honey mustard.  If I wanted both I would have to pay extra .35 and I would get 2 cane sauce and 2 honey mustard.  How stupid is that??  The final bit though was when I got my food and he asked if I wanted any ketchup.  I said yes, and some salt.  They were out of salt!  WTF?? What food joint runs out of salt???  Anyway, the chicken tenders are average, the french fries were undercooked and limpy, coleslaw the little bit they give you is okay but the best part was the bread.  I won't bother to go out of my way to go back.  They have very good marketing but the product is MEH.",

I've been to this location a few times and they are consistent with these: very friendly service (your order is considered '1 love', manager checks up on you), very tasty chicken fingers, interesting crowd, and sadly one or two fingers are always tiny 'pinky fingers'. The fries are average, the coleslaw is bleh, the Texas toast is nice, and the drinks have free refills.  Very fast paced, fast food atmosphere. Especially during the school semesters. The air is a mix of deep fried goodness and ammonia from the table cleaning. Turnover of customers during lunch is kind of frenetic. There are movie posters (Goonies!) all along the walls.",

Well let me just say, fighting all the traffic near ASU, while the Tempe Arts Festival was taking place and University shrinking down to one lane was well worth it! Plus even after my 15 minute drive back to work my food was still hot.  I got the 3 Chicken Finger combo which came with fries, Texas toast, Cane sauce and a drink. It was probably the best chicken fingers I've ever had!  The chicken fingers are made with 100% never frozen chicken tenderloins which is marinated for 24 hours so they come out extremely moist. They're perfectly seasoned and breaded, not too much and not too little. The cane sauce is so yummy.  It tastes like it has ketchup, mayo, worcestershire, seasonings but I'm not sure what else is in it, however its excellent, you have to try it! The Texas toast had a crisp outer crust but is soft inside. It was buttered and wonderful. The fries were pretty good basic fries; salted and crinkle cut.  I highly recommended trying Raising Cane's if you've never been!",

Well, I have to tell you, their chicken tenders are amazing! Tender and juicy and just wow, and so well complimented by the Cane Sauce, which is sort of like a peppery thousand island. As for the Texas Toast, okay but seems odd, maybe it is from a different food culture of which I am not familiar. The  fries, nothing special though the coleslaw is light and just slightly sweet and a good counterpoint to the chicken tenders.   I'm not a big fan of fast food but this has an unexpected authentic feel and quality that runs rings around the chicken tenders at places like Popeye's. Looking at some other reviews it seems the reason for the quality of the chicken is that it is never frozen, good to know, see what you can learn from your fellow yelpers?   Bottom line, different from your average fast food chicken place and worth a visit. :-)",

They are open on weekends and have consistent hours (they were the second place we tried to go to for chicken fingers that was supposed to be open). 2.) They have pretty decent prices. 3.) Their Cane sauce is pretty delish.  NOTABLE: The restaurant was WAY clean.  I witnessed the tables getting bussed promptly and cleaned off with cleaner and PAPER TOWELS.  This is huge.  They also sprayed and wiped down the benches.  The employees were super duper!  I was being a counter space hog and filling three drinks when an employee came up to refill the iced tea.  I didn't notice him at first, but when I did he told me to take my time.  Then he noticed I needed a lid for the child cup I had and asked if I would like one.  He promptly went and got me the lid before returning to refill the iced tea.  What a great employee!  I wish I had caught his name!  *The only reason I don't give them five stars is that Rock N Roll Fingers, a local business, has fingers that are about 50% bigger for nearly the same price.  They also have multiple sauce options.  If they had been open last Saturday, I would have eaten there.  Alas, they were closed at 1 p.m. on a day that they were listed as open.  :/  Bad for them, good for Cane's!",

The recipe they have here is better than Chick Fil A or anything like that. It's never frozen chicken with something called a \"24 hour marinade\" that keeps the chicken really juicy. As a first-timer, I order The Box and it was more than a full meal.

Nicely breaded but not so breaded that it overpowers the chicken.  Tastes like real chicken, not any processed crap.  Nice and hot, great taste.  And the dipping sauce they give you is amazing!  That stuff is addicting.  The crinkle cut fries are nothing special but very solid.  Not bad by any means but just  nothing to write home about.  The texas toast doesn't look like anything special but its actually very good.  I'd recommend laying a tender on the toast and having an open-faced sandwich.  They say the lemonade is fresh squeezed, I didn't really believe it but I love a good lemonade so I ordered it even though it was an extra $.30.  OH MY GOD BEST 30 CENTS I HAVE EVER SPENT!  They are not lying when they say it is fresh squeezed.  Easily some of the best lemonade I have ever had.  The pricing is pretty decent for what you are getting.  Their 6 tender meal with 3 sides (fries, toast and cole slaw are advertised but you can substitute any of them for extra of something else.  I get either extra fries or toast in place of slaw), 2 sauces and a large drink is going to come out to around 8 or 9 bucks.  Could be a little cheaper for the amount you are getting but the quality of the food justifies it.  My only real complaint is that they need to give out more sauce!  If the worst thing about this place is they need to give out more of their fantastic sauce, I'd say it's a place worth trying.  Highly recommend!",

Tonight we asked for larges..no biggie, right! We mentioned it so she could correct her mistake yet again..still no biggie UNTIL this girl really had the nerveeee to get an attitude even after I paid the difference gladly. Like excuse the hell outta me but we corrected you 3 times politely with NO GRIEF and you felt the need to huff and puff??? I'm literally writing this before eating my food she was so rude.

I usually get my fix whenever I hit Vegas. I was in Phoenix for the day and totally remembered that they have Canes in the area.   Their chicken strips are amazing along with the Canes sauce that comes with it. I always go with the Caniac Combo even though it's a lot to eat. The Texas Toast is amazing as well. It compliments the food very well.   I give this place a 5 easily, especially since their restaurant area is open until midnight. The other locations nearby are only opened until 11, with this one being open an extra hour. It definitely helped since I visited about 11:40 in the evening.   Definitely hit this place up. The staff is pretty nice as well. Great overall experience. I can't wait to come back!",

This last visit-- First, my total for the box combo was $7.77, I had .86c in my coin tray and asked the girl to wait while I gave her the change portion of my total. I drop a dime in the crack between my seat and middle console. So I have 76c at this point and before handing it over I ask her if thats OK? She said YES. I give her the change and she closes the window for 1-2 minutes and then gives me my dollar change and....99c... I'm dumb founded what just happened. Next-- I get my box combo and somehow I got double sauce and no coleslaw.   They have good food-- theres no doubt or question there. But as far as the quality of the trainers and for lack of motivation of beating around the bush right now to be polite, a competent staff.  Do better Cane's.

Circle K hot dogs or 2. some pretty tasty chicken and sides...well let's just say I can't think of too many scenarios that would lead anyone to choose option 1. But it's just as likely that I am wrong as it is I'm right. As for Raisin Canes. Good chicken everything more or less. Great tenders/strips whatever you call them. Especially good when you go there at 1:30 am high as hell and needing some late night grind. College atmosphere and at 1:30 on a Friday night definitely the classic after bar collection of dorm housed freshman, and around any college campus types. Kind of feels like you are in an Episode Of the Twilight Zone. Then again that could have been the copious amounts of THC in my system. Either way, well worth the trip.",

    "text": "For a place that only sells chicken and has a very small menu and ALWAYS busy with a long drive-thru that blocks part of the cars parked, it is the best Raising Cane's we've visited in Arizona.  The chicken is never dry and the flavor is consistent.  Their staff is respectful, in a good mood and somewhat quiet when they need to be.  The one thing that stood out on our first visit at this location was how well the staff works with each other.  The staff taking the orders is ALWAYS helpful and they are flexible when ordering large orders.  Half and half of this or that.  The drive-thru line moves very quickly and we never wait long for our food.  Two days ago when we were dining in with my family in the evening the Manager was walking around the restaurant clearing things up all around the areas and stopped by every table to check in on his customers.  Which is probably why the restaurant stays clean with all their traffic.  When he came to our table he asked if everything was okay, we said, yes thank you and then asked if we needed anything else... more dipping sauces?  We normally do need more sauces but these places charge extra for their sauces so we were surprised by the question at first.  The only thing that's tricky about this restaurant is their location and the front door placement. Since most customers park on the side (by the drive-thru line) or in the back we enter and exit from the back door.  The problem is that since most college students in the area come in large groups they block part of the areas between tables so SOMETIMES it can feel like an obstacle course to get to the front to place an order but not as bad as you think.  Nothing that would keep me from coming back though.  There's are four other Raising Cane's closer to us than this location but we LOVE their food and their service.  We've also visited the location in Flagstaff (another college town) and it's the only other good Cane's in AZ. This one in Tempe just seems to have a lot more younger ladies coming in with clothes that leave little to the imagination, those poor girls.   haha",

    "text": "Raising Cane's has been a favorite eating place of mine since I have been able to drive.   It has a humble menu, but delivers very well on what it offers. Cane's delivers exactly what is promises: high quality chicken with tasty sides. Not to mention their famous sweet tea, but be sure to fill your cup with ice because their tea will melt it quickly. Every time the chicken comes out hot and tasting fresh. Their crinkle-cut fries never disappoint and their cole slaw is delicious if you ever want a slightly healthier option. Their texas toast is perfectly buttered and toasted every time. On top of all of this, Cane's always gives very generous portions. They also   Cane's delivers both quality and quantity. Not only that, but for a good price too. Every entree on the menu runs under ten dollars. In my opinion you get far more than what you pay for. Even if they decided to charge an extra couple dollars, I wouldn't mind. They are also very flexible and don't charge for any side substitutions. You don't even have to be under twelve to get a kid's meal! Definitely a good affordable option for a college student like myself. Cane's honestly provides fried chicken better and cheaper than most dining restaraunts.  Now let's talk about Cane's atmosphere. For a full Cane's experience, you must eat in. There is always a cool retro vibe, with old school movie posters and a disco ball overhead. It is very family friendly, and they always play clean music with a positive vibe. It is very relaxed and easygoing, perfectly complimenting its style of food and service. You are free to arrange tables however you wish and make yourself at home while you are there. A perfect place for a small family or a group of friends looking for a quick, cheap, and tasty meal.  Cane's service is spectacular and consistent. They really go out of their way to make you feel special every time. They always greet with a smile, address you by name, and are happy to answer any questions you have. You can count on them to clear your table once you are finished, and they will never let you sit down at a dirty table. Not to mention the speed of Cane's service. Even when the restaurant is packed, you will never wait more than ten minutes for your food. The staff remains very patient and will attend to you if you simply raise your hand. Their drive-thru experience is just as exemplary as its eat-in. They always talk with courtesy and respect, they waste no time to give you what you order, and go the extra mile to make sure you are happy. Just watch out when you go during busy hours! The line can get very backed up and parking is usually packed. I personally think it is worth the wait, but your discretion is warranted!  All in all, if you like fried chicken, Cane's is the place for you. Just be aware that chicken is their specialty and if you go expecting much more, you might disappoint yourself.",

No matter what combination you get of the chicken fingers, you're never disappointed and you never walk away with an unsatisfied stomach. I personally like switching out the coleslaw for the toast because their Texas Toast is so delicious but some people prefer the coleslaw. The sweet iced tea is really good as well and comes with most of the combos. It's really sweet so I like mixing mine with a little bit of the unsweet iced tea but that's up to you to decide if you like that over a fountain soda! Quick, easy, delicious, and fairly cheap!",

The food is delicious but would def not eat it regularly. Super greasy (would be great after a night on Mill tho). The chicken fingers were fresh and all white meat. Super crispy! And the sauce goes well with it. There is a copious amount of fries that went with the meal. Btw I ordered the Caniac. 6 chicken fingers, texas toast (which was bomb but also greasy) , cole slaw, and a pile of fries. And a large drink.  when I say greasy though...its not swimming in oil. Just the right amount of grease i think. It could get salty but the coleslaw cuts the saltiness. Perfect balance.  Would definitely comeback! I wanna try their sandwiches!  The combo meal I got came out to 8.98... Kinda pricey but it fed me and my sister pretty well.   3.5 stars!!!!!",

I love chicken and I can't even explain how badly I miss and crave Cane's since I graduated and left Tempe.   This location is always clean, the staff is so nice, its huge and even on crowded days I've always found somewhere to sit. They get you your food out pretty quickly and its always hot and fresh. I love that they have sweet tea. Their Cane's sauce is awesome. I just love love love this place.   If you don't want chicken, or have a lame-o in your group who doesn't want chicken, then don't come here. They really only sell chicken, but they've definitely perfected the craft and I wish they'd put a location in Utah.",

They have the option for two seater booths, which I like. The food here is of course delicious, but the chicken seemed to be less breaded than usual, with some sides of the chicken being almost visible, which is the reasoning for only 4 stars. Other than that the venue is great. It serves its purpose as a college hangout and has a youthful vibrance to it. I do like that they even added a little disco ball for some flair. The servers were kind and attentive, while giving a sense of urgency, which is what is always best in the fast food industry. The only thing I would complain about, as is with all raising canes, is the sauce. Make the frickin sauce free!",

I just went there for the first time and wow everything was soggy (we had a 5 minute drive back to our hotel) which is just terrible!  The chicken tenders had no flavor, the special sauce is not that special I was hoping it would be a spicy ranch! The fries had such a plain taste to them I didn't want to finish them! The only bright side of the whole thing was the piece of toast, it had GREAT flavor but was also soggy! Beware if you go here!! Customer service was also sub par, charged for a large water (subbed out the soda in my meal water and charged haha) then charged for a large sweet tea and ended up getting a medium!",

    "text": "This place does a fine job at cooking chicken tenders and fries. They even got the Texas toast down to a perfection.  Came in here while trolling around Tempe and decided to give them a shout out. Located very close to ASU and should be a popular spot when you need to catch some bird.  Ordered the biggest thing on the menu called the Caniac Combo. Stopped drinking the dreaded soda pop and went with some dihydrogen monoxide. It is a lot better for you and the price of the combo goes down quite a bit.  The menu here is very simple and they give you a basic no thrills meal. You can always substitute some of the sides if you so desire. The big thing everyone cries about is the top secret sauce. Maybe I missed the boat on this one but it is nothing more than some doctored up mayonnaise.  Food is pretty good and the chicken is very tender. Good chance they are doing that southern trick of marinating it in some seasoned butter milk overnight. That always keeps it juicy and flavorful after frying.  Would like to see some more dipping sauces. Just take some regular Franks hot sauce and add equal parts of brown sugar and simmer it in a pan. Some country fried chicken gravy would be good also. Maybe just offer some jalapenos or something spicy to add a little kick.  Definity gets really busy around lunch time. Saw tons of sweaty blue collar workers (like me) coming in and chowing down on big plates of chicken. Some of them looked like they could have skipped the soda pop as well.  Recommend bringing your own dipping sauce or hot sauce to complete the occasion. Some people just need more options. CLUCK CLUCK A-OK!  3.25 STARS",

I waited for 10 mins in the front and tried going through the front door which was locked, none of the employees were bothered to check on me and were busy packing up. I finally had to bang on the window on drive thru (one employee who noticed me first just mouthed 'we are closed' and walked away), when I finally got the order from the guy who told me to wait in the front, he forgot to put in the ketchup.

I'll be the first to admit that I was a big chick fil a fan for most of my life, they also have great food and have never done me wrong (except maybe a couple nights with food poisoning).    I discovered canes at a meeting on campus at the University where they were giving it out for free. The food was amazing and I loved the sauce even more. It instantly became my go to place for getting chicken.  However, what has kept me coming back fairly regularly for 4 years now is their customer service. I can't even remember the last time I went to a competitor. The staff has ALWAYS  been very friendly, outgoing, and helpful. I have never once been disappointed in a visit to canes and always left in a better mood. It's weird to say that for a fast food restaurant but it's True.   I have found myself coming back more frequently since I met the manager, Lewis, who is a very friendly and outgoing guy.  He is always helping out his staff and motivating them throughout the day. He is always comforting the others guests and I that our food will be right out - and will be well worth the wait ( I've never waited longer than 5 mins - even at the busiest times).   Overall if you are looking for a good place for chicken and fries this is hands down the best place to go. I would and have recommended this place to all my friends and family that come to town.",
