    "text": "What a great little place. The food and atmosphere were awesome (really enjoyed the music, made me feel like we were in New Orleans, or watching one of my favorite shows...miss you Treme). Our waiter was great and the serving portions were just right (the chicken and sausage gumbo was soooo tasty, and really digged the homemade chips). The only reason I did not give 5-stars is that I felt it was just a wee-bit pricy for lunch (but you will have to forgive me, as I am a bit of a bargain hunter).  We enjoyed our visit when they were located in Phoenix, and were very pleased to see that they relocated closer to home (our home of course). I am looking forward to their future expansion, which should allow for more seating as well as a more attractive bar area. (also thank you so much for cleansing my mind and body of our earlier horrible Coco's experience).",

When my party of 6 arrived we told our waiter that we would be needing 4 seperate checks and we were led to believe that this was not a problem.When our check came he told us that it would take him too long to figure it out seperately and that we should do it ourselves on the back of the bill and write out our seperate amounts so he could give us all our seperate total! I thought thats what I was paying him to do???  NEVER IN MY LIFE HAVE I HAD TO FIGURE OUT AND SEPERATE MY OWN BILL AND WRITE IT DOWN FOR THE WAITER! If seperate checks was a problem we should have been told so at the beginning of our evening and we could have adjusted accordingly!  If we all were at 4 different tables we would have recieved seperate checks, so what was the problem! This was very annoying to me and it is unfortuanate because food was great as always and the service was great up to that point! If seperate checks are a problem then please tell your guests up front so this never happens again!! It's too bad a fun night out with friends left us in a bad mood at the end of out evening!! Will I still eat at Baby Kays?  Yes! I just hope they take this consructive criticism to heart and change things accordingly!",

He plays a good mix of instrumental music. Service was good and prompt. The only negative I had was the standard sauce that came with catfish was a horseradish very potent. Lucky there was a bottle of pepper sauce on table saved the evening.  There are additional sauces available but they cost extra. Green olive coleslaw was good. We will be back",

We ordered the cajun combination and the cornish game hen. The house salad was not too appetizing but when is a house salad really going to impress anyone anyway. The cornish game hen and the crawfish etoufee were really good. The only downside is that the chicken gumbo wasn't that great and most of the dishes were on the salty side. That's the only downsides. If I ever were to come again I would totally get the crawfish etoufee.",

My wife, the sea food eater, LOVED the crab cakes and we both shared and enjoyed the red beans & rice, jambalaya, pulled pork sliders and original chicken wings.  The wings were some of the best we've ever had anywhere!  Also tried the cup of gumbo, dirty rice and potato salad, all of which were very good.  A really nice extra was the garlic bread that came with our food - absolutely fantastic!  Since there are really no other authentic cajun places around, we'll be going back to Baby Kay's...often!",

Right out of the gate the sweet tea needs work...seriously if this is supposed to be southern you'll need to improve it quite a bit (let this southern boy know if you need some help).  The hush puppies came out and I was immediately nervous because they smelled like they were burned, however they were very crisp and perfect consistency on the inside with great flavor along with horseradish sauce.  I ordered the cajun combination and everything was great. I'm not going to say that the gumbo is incredible in fact it was a touch bland but it was still passable.  The jambalaya was flavorful and was much better than I expected.  Now, the piece de resistance...the etouffee was phenomenal!!! I have been searching for a place that does this right and I have found it!  I would not usually give a high rating because of the few inadequacies but the etouffee blasted this place out of the park for me.  The service was prompt and friendly and major kudos (maybe small to some but it is that little extra) they packed my leftovers for me.  Also, this is the only Cajun joint that I know of that serves it up this good in AZ (seriously I think you 'Trina refuges need to get to work opening up some more worth while joints)!",

    "text": "Baby Kay's has transformed the space previously occupied by Cajun Seafood Corner. Gone is the kitsch of 1980s New Orleans, to be pleasantly replaced with a more subtle and austere atmosphere reminscent of an underground jazz joint. The bar still features prominently at the front, but has a classy vibe. The restaurant has doubled it's space, adding enough tables to handle the Friday night crowd very well while leaving a good corner open for some live Jazz guitar. We started with a basket of hushpuppies served with ketchup and remoulade for dipping. We ordered a Cajun Combo, and Baby Kay's Combo. The olive slaw I received was cool, creamy, and crisp, topped with a blackening seasoning that I though overpowered it a bit. The gumbo was sniffle-inducing and wonderful, with a very earthy flavor and a good amount of meat in it. The crawfish etoufee was the highlight of my experience. Where I had expected minced meats, I found whole crawfish pieces (sans shell) that tasted sweet and fresh. The dish was full and flavorful, sweet but with a pleasant spice to it. I must admit that at this point, I had to surrender. I simply did not have enough room left for the jambalaya, which I am enjoying as I type this. Sticky and soft, I think it does not stand up against other's I've had. Overall, this restaurant offered great service even while busy, the atmosphere took me straight to Bourbon Street and left me wanting to return to tackle the rest of the menu, Po' Boys and some great dessert options. 5 out of 5 Fat Guy Points.",

The decor was New Orleans camp (lots of skeleton stuff).   My friend had the fried catfish and shrimp basket with fries ($12.95). The fish was fine, but the fries were just ordinary freezer bag fries. She said her food was OK.  The restaurant is clean and parking is close to the door.

This place cooks some really tasty food and the insides are well decorated with plenty of Louisiana style decorations as well as several cool looking mardi gras paintings and other fun items on the walls.  We came here on a business lunch and had the chance to get here right when they opened. Service was very friendly and the food came out rather quickly. They even have an area for a guitarist that plays during special occasions. NICE!  We started with some of their Lulu's Sweet and Spicy Tabasco Wings and a cup of Chicken and Andouille Gumbo. The wings were large and fried just right and the sauce had some nice tangy flavors. The gumbo was also very good and had just the right amount of heat.  The guys ordered the fried Catfish and Shrimp entree and the Jambalaya with Andouille Sausage. Yours truly went with the Catfish covered in Crawfish Etouffee Sauce and a side of their Olive Coleslaw. Everything was spectacular and tasted just like what you get while visiting the New Orleans area.  The menu here is not very large and missing some of the popular blacked fish dishes that you usually see down south. Would like to see a few more types of seafood and possibly some spicy bacon wrapped cheese stuffed shrimp or some alligator options.  Definitely will be coming back again to try out some of their other specialties like their yummy Po'Boys and their different types of Etouffees and Gumbos. Cajun food is hard to find in the AZ desert and they do a great job. AHYEE!  4.25 STARS",

The potato salad didn't have much flavor and just tasted bland.   I thought it was expensive for a lunch meal. I paid $16 total and ordered water because I do not drink soda. I haven't been back because I am a fan of good prices almost everything on the menu was over $11 even for a sandwich.",

I think this will end up as my go-to dish when I come here. The hush puppies were light and crisp served with a tarter sause and a ketchup.  I did not try the ketchup because after I had the tarter sauce, I just wanted to eat as much of that as I could. I think they mixed some horseradish in it. So good.   The restaurant had a cool, laid-back atmosphere. The music was great and so was the artwork (most of which was for sale). Service was OK but the place was not busy when we were there so I would expect it to be fine.  I'll be back. I just wish it wasn't all the way in Mesa.",

Great flavors with everything we had. If you're interested in dessert, the bread pudding was fabulous, just like everything else.",

We were there last Saturday night, bit of a drive for us & we were so excited to be there but we were so disappointed in the ambiance. They had KSLX blasting, really?! I love rock n roll but there were commercials more than music on that station. And it's surprising they don't have Pandora or something. We asked them to turn it down especially so we could hear the live entertainment, but they didn't. The first waitress that seated us made a passive aggressive comment to us when we asked for a certain table rather than her first choice. The bright light was our new waiter started his shift with us as one of his tables. I forgot his name but he's new there. Great service and nice personality. We will go back, of course!",

It starts off slow but then it takes off. The best part was the live music played by someone who know how to play an electric guitar and blues music.",

The ones at the Angry Crab are much better.  My friend had the Cajun Combo with the seafood gumbo.  He said it was good but nothing real special.  He did like the potato salad.  I think that the prices are a little high.  Another thing is that I have never eaten in a Cajun restaurant that did not have boiled crawfish on the menu.....that is until I ate here.  I don't know about you but when I hear Cajun, crawfish is the first thing that comes to my mind.  Not with these owners though. Anyway, not bad, just not good enough to want to go back.",

The spiciness is up there with a good Mexican dish. Rice was not the best but not the worst either, it looked like instant and had been sitting for a bit. Cole slaw...... No, I've had better at Church's Chicken. BUT, I didn't go hungry.",

The rice cuts the heat though. I give the dish 5 stars (the entree price is $19) . The potato salad that it came with wasn't good at all. Very dry (couldn't taste any mayo) but was heavy on relish. It just was bad. The garlic bread tasted frozen. So yeah. It's ok. The 3 stars instead of 4 are for slow service (asked for more rice and waitress/bartender forgot) and the price is steep for what it is.",

We've tried a few different menu items including the crab cakes, gumbo, shrimp po boy, jambalaya, stuffed chicken, seafood enchiladas, and shrimp etouffee. I have not had Cajun food elsewhere but if it tastes anything like the dishes served here then totally sign me up! I'm sure it's expected but everything is a bit on the spicy-side with a lot of different seasonings.  Our favorites so far have been the gumbo & shrimp etouffee because of the flavors. I only tried a bite but the crawfish etouffee was amazing as well! I would say that the only disappointment so far has been the shrimp po boy. I didn't find it to be as tasty as I expected it to be especially compared to the other items.  They offer special menu items (changes daily) as well as live music on some of the nights. The service we have received has been good every time! Overall, definitely a place to check out and one we won't hesitate to return to.",

In fact, I drug my husband back the next evening for dinner so that I could give it a second try and see if it was as good.  Firstly, the server Dustin was awesome and assured me I couldn't go wrong with any of the choices.  He was correct.  We tried a crab cake, seafood gumbo, and crawfish etouffee. Being from the NW, I prefer a little less kick (Old Bay spice?) to my crab cakes but for happy hour price, you get a good sized cake!  The gumbo had amazing flavor and was chock full of seafood.  I have to admit, most of the other times I've had gumbo, it was thicker and less soup-like. This has more of a broth but we realllllllllly enjoyed it.  The winner though is the crawfish etouffee.  It's Arizona.  It's finally not hot as balls and you can start to eat what I call \"Fall Food.\" The etouffee is the ultimate comfort Fall Food.  My daughter said she could eat it all day; every day.  The next evening, my husband and I went and this time, I tried a half of a shrimp Po Boy along with a cup of crawfish etouffee (yes, I had to have it again.)  I didn't snap a picture of it but the batter was crisp and light.. more of a cornmeal-esque batter... but they perfect.  Not rubbery or overly cooked.  I could eat a basket of shrimp and etouffee and be a very happy gal.  We also tried the dirty rice.  I had never had it so I have nothing to compare it to.  My husband loved it.  I liked it alright but if I had to venture a guess, it's probably better than anybody else's.  Topping it all off with a hurricane while sitting outside watching the sun set over palm trees.  Now, that's a perfect Arizona evening! We will be back.",

It's been a \"reward\" after a good dental checkup for a few years now (my dentist is across the street, next to Macayo's, but crunchy chips won't do after a cleaning), and I've celebrated a few birthday/special occasion dinners here. Pleasant atmosphere, a busy bar, and an outdoor seating area make this cozy strip mall location shine. I've enjoyed the wings, fried catfish, gumbo, and many appetizers at Happy Hour, but my favorite is the crawfish etoufee. Rich and hearty, with just the right amount of heat, served with toasted bread and (my choice) green olive cole slaw. Tastes great with a cold Abita, spicy Bloody Mary, or a strong Hurricane (or all three. Did I mention Happy Hour?). Come check it out!",

    "text": "Word of mouth has lead me to many great dining establishments all over the valley. Tonight, I got to share one of those discoveries with my oldest son. A former co-worker introduced me to Baby Kay's Cajun Kitchen a little over a year ago. Since then, I've been back a few times to enjoy the authentic Creole cuisine.  Like me, my son has an adventurous interest in food, so I knew he would enjoy something different for dinner. We started with the Baby Kay's Sampler. This was a huge portion of deep fried goodness! It includes fries, fried oysters, fried shrimp, hush puppies, jalapeno poppers and fried catfish. Awesome variety! And considering it's a fried appetizer, you can still taste the quality of the product.  My son made a great selection for his entree. He loved (and devoured) his Pulled Pork Po' Boy. I told him it would be stuffed. And he wasn't disappointed. I've enjoyed a Po' Boy on occasion here.  I chose the daily special (Seafood Enchiladas) which our server Andrea described perfectly. She did a really amazing job too and even my son realized that her service was spot on. My enchiladas (more like mini burritos) were stuffed with shrimp and crawfish etouffee, served over dirty rice and smothered in a tequila cheese sauce. Oh my goodness! I cannot even begin to describe the flavor. And the portion was huge!  Besides great service, great atmosphere, great food and great company, what made me happy was hearing my son say he was going to have to tell his friends about Baby Kay's. Word of mouth. Pass it on!",

I also got a combo this time trying 3 of the Cajun staples,  jambalaya, etoufee, and gumbo.  I really liked all three and glad they were distinct in their own way.  I like the potato salad more than the coleslaw, I was expecting a more zingy flavor with the green olives.. my boyfriend likes the seafood basket with oysters and catfish. He ordered it again with the dirty rice which was flavorful as well.    Definitely suggest getting the pain killer, be careful it can be a sneaky one.   Service was great both times.  The waitress we had last night was vey helpful and patience that goes a long way in my book.    I guess po' boys will be next and of course an order of lulu wings ( I think I'm hooked)",

The reviews about the etouffee are True. It is slammin and I ate about half of my husband's plate! I got their BBQ shrimp and it was good but the sauce was unique and definitely not your typically BBQ sauce so just go into it knowing that. Great portions.  Side salad was excellent. Wasn't a huge fan of the green olive coleslaw but I had to try it because I've never heard of those flavors put together. Garlic was amazing!   My biggest reason for giving them 4 instead of 5 stars is kinda petty- they don't have beignets!! And that is so very Cajun and New Orleans. Our server said he had multiple requests for them in the past week so hopefully they start making them soon! If they do, I'll change my review to 5 stars!",

I can't say I've had that experience before at a restaurant and it definitely made this place stand out for quality service. The food was delicious and we had a great time.",

    "text": "December 21st I was leaving a late appointment near here and my boyfriend and I were starving.  We did a quick google search and found this restaurant.  Although it was closing within 30 minutes we decided to stop in anyways.  We eat quickly and knew we would be done before closing, as we did not want to be \"those\" people.  In addition, my boyfriend loves cajun and I had always wanted to try this restaurant.  When we walked in the door there were a few other tables with people still eating and we were quickly seated and reminded that they were closing soon.  I didn't feel they were rude in any way but I am sure they were a little irritated by people who come in this close to closing, and I don't blame them.  Our waiter approached and quickly got us our drinks and our food came shortly after we ordered it.  The food was amazing and the atmosphere had a definite family feel.  As we had anticipated, we finished before 9pm and there were still patrons in the restaurant eating and socializing.  Although we were the dreaded customers that came in right before close, I never felt rushed or treated poorly.  In fact, everyone seemed very friendly and the service was impeccable.  I can't believe I waited so long to try this place and I know it will be an added regular to our list.  Thanks again for your hospitality and friendly service when many restaurants would not have acted in the same manner.  You have customers for life.",

Food is a teeny bit spicy here so be prepared to grab a chilled Abita beer with dinner. Can't wait to get back!",

I'm not a huge fan of fried food, so I immediately became concerned. That said, I ate some of everything, and it was all pretty tasty.  But the entrees are where it's at here. I had the Cajun Combination, which included jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and gumbo. The jambalaya was decent. I tried the duck and andouille sausage gumbo, and the duck was really tender and tasty. The etoufee was the highlight of the trio. The crawfish was plentiful, and the sauce was tasty. Oh, and the vinaigrette option for the salad was excellent! There's a nice, spicy kick to most of the dishes. Just right for me (granted, I'm a bit of a pepper belly). I also tried a couple bites of the catfish dish with crawfish, and it was fantastic! The catfish was juicy and tender inside and crispy outside. Perfect!   There was some nice live music for part of the meal. The service was decent and friendly.   Great option for Cajun!",

I was craving some here in Phoenix, so I thought I'd give Baby Kay's a try.  It's located in a shopping strip with a good amount of parking. The restaurant is big, simple in decor, and there are a couple of servers. I feel like they need at least one more person helping out in the dining room because service was very slow, although when she did stop by our table, she was very good.  We started with the hush puppies, which were a good portion size for the price, but the spices seemed to be lacking. I know hush puppies are usually a simple batter deep fried to perfection, but these were nothing to write home about.  Shrimp etouffee was pretty good. I like that the shrimp were fresh, not frozen, and that there were lots of them. Accompanying rice did not seem fresh, though. Chicken po-boy with BBQ sauce was very boring and not worth the price, but unfortunately that's to be expected of non-seafood dishes in seafood restaurants.  I think the spices were kind of lacking all around, and the service was slow. Prices were kind of high, but at least the seafood is fresh. It wasn't worth the drive for me. Don't think I'll be back.",

We ordered the Cajun combo, two catfish poboys dressed, and bread pudding.  First, the Cajun combo: we substituted the gumbo for red beans and rice, and had the crawfish etouffee and jambalaya. ALL VERY GOOD! I felt like I was eating good home cooked food.  Next the catfish poboys: these were great, really enjoyed mine. The cheese was different than what I'm used to having on a poboy, but it was still good none the less.  Last, the bread pudding: loved it. Bread pudding is my favorite dessert- hands down. The whiskey sauce for the bread pudding came on the side; however, I opted to forgo putting it on the dessert because I don't like whiskey (and it had a strong whiskey taste), and the bread pudding was amazing without it!   Overall, the service was good, the lady at the bar was very friendly, the atmosphere felt like I was somewhere relaxing on magazine street- I felt like I was back in my hometown.  I can definitely say any feelings of being homesick, disappeared once I walked inside Baby Kay's, so I'll definitely be ordering from here/ dining here again, and I'll be recommending it to other people.",

We had a nice comfy booth, and I was very pleased to see they had real sweet tea (I was raised in South Carolina and sometimes miss having it at every restaurant). I had the combo with gumbo, jambalaya and the crawfish etoufee. They were all delicious. I don't care for tomatoes, and I thoroughly enjoyed these because none of them were tomato base. I even had a few leftovers to take home. My boyfriend had their Cajun Burger, which he said was very good, the only complaint being that the menu said it had your choice of cheese as well as some blue cheese crumbles, but the waiter didn't ask and it was served with no cheese. So if you go and order that you might want to ask for the \"cheeseburger\"? Otherwise all was well, and I was totally digging the blues music.",

Was in the area and had been wanting to try this place based on other reviews. Ordered a cup of seafood gumbo that was priced at $6.50 for happy hour and a oyster Po'Boy sandwich which was about $13. Received a small cup of gumbo with several tiny pieces of shrimp. The flavor and heat level were good but way overpriced and disappointing overall. My wife's chicken and sausage gumbo at least had lots of meat. Po'Boy was equally disappointing and overpriced. Came out not assembled so you had to do that yourself. Bun was cheap light weight bun probably store bought. The sandwich included about 6 or 7 tiny oysters, one tomato sliced in half, couple pickles and some shredded lettuce. The sandwich itself was only about 7 inches. I could hardly taste the oysters for the thick cheap bread. If you want a good Po'Boy try \"Flavors of Louisiana\". Their Po'Boy is outstanding.",

    "text": "Baby Kay's is still the best Cajun food in the Valley. My husband is from NOLA so we have credibility! :)  I worry about them staying in business because their Mesa location is terrible. They are worth driving for. Truly! I love Baby Kay's combo with chicken and sausage gumbo, red beans and rice, and green olive coleslaw. So freaking good! Love the crawfish etouffee enchiladas for lunch on Tuesdays. The patio is dog friendly. And they often have live music which takes you out of Phoenix and straight to Bourbon Street.",

If you come by yourself they seat you way in the back behind everyone else where you can't even see the live music (oh the music was good). I kept wishing someone from the big group directly in front of me would go to the bathroom so that I could see. Then the extremely extremely disappointing food. The Gumbo taste okay however it had an odd taste and a bunch of overcooked crawfish that was the best thing that I had and it was not all that great. The barbecue shrimp should be called Worcestershire sauce and overcooked shrimp. All I taste was Worcestshire sauce they should take that trash off of the menu. My garlic bread was burnt, the wings were just ok. The sweet tea was the best thing that I had.",

    "text": "I can't wait to go back for more! We decided to try a few things: bbq shrimp on happy hour, which has a spicy Worcestershire sauce, seafood gumbo, alligator and clam basket, and the vegetable ettoufee. The ettoufee was creamy without being too rich. Perfectly spiced and veggies were not overcooked. The seafood gumbo was light on spices, which let the natural sweetness of the seafood come thru. We also had hushpuppies which came with a creamy horseradish sauce. Again, not too spicy which allows the flavors to come together. I really loved everything. The dirty rice was salted just enough. We didn't want to give up the plate with the bbq sauce, we were dipping our bread in it. So good! I was very impressed with the alligator. I haven't had any this good for 15+ years. Cooked perfectly, using tender pieces of meat and a delicate batter.  Lastly, the olive cole slaw. They really put extra love into the dishes. You can tell when you taste the food.  Waitress provided excellent service and I would recommend this place 100%. I know I'll be back. Try this restaurant!",

    "text": "Decided to check this place out finally and was well worth the trip.  Traveled from Ahwatukee, which nothing is really that far but for food sometimes its not worth it.  Either way, after reading other yelpers reviews and seeing the pics for HH everyday from 2-5 figured a Saturday afternoon trip over after some shopping sounded like a plan.  As most places, a strip mall restaurant doesn't look like much on the outside.  Dark windows because of sun and a small patio but too hot to sit outside still.  First impressions was good.  Nothing spectacular for decor. Tables are well placed apart from each other, a few booths, a great use of chalkboard for specials, and a decent bar but not over stated.  Wait to be seated, which wasn't crowded so about 2 minutes before a waiter came to seat us.  Menu is simple which was where I got hopeful they actually specialize in what they cook instead of some of these places who have too many selections that all taste the same.  We ordered 1 item from the starters and that was the fritters. They were pretty darn good.  Didn't taste the oil, good corn bread mixture, could have incorporated actual corn to make them better but they served with a horseradish deep that was fantastic.  From the HH menu, we selected: Hurricane shrimp, Crab Cake, Duck and Andouile gumbo, Seafood gumbo, Crawfish etouffee, BBQ pork sliders and LuLu's wings. I've posted pics as well but here's my take - Shrimp were fantastic, 6 shrimp swimming in their honey hot sauce with a scoop of white rice in the middle.  My BF could have licked the plate.  Sauce provided heat but not where you can't taste anything else.  Crab Cake they slipped on the sage and it tasted like thanksgiving stuffing.  Not much crab so I'd pass on that one when I go back.  Gumbos were amazing!  This is where they have concentrated their efforts and KUDO's to them!  Seafood gumbo was a tad better than the duck/sausage from a fat content.  They were both prepared perfectly.  The Crawfish Etouffee was rich and flavorful and bursting with crawfish.  A must try as well.  LuLu's wings were deep fried and then sauced with the Hurricane sauce but not so great IMO.  They turned out a bit too sweet for my tastes.  But based on the consistency of the batter on the wing I bet their fried chicken is good.  The wings were a nice size but again, too sweet for me. And last but not least the pork sliders.  Great amount of pork on each slider, sauced with very well could have been the Hurricane sauce - was sweet, tangy not spicy BBQ flavor. Could taste a hint of smoked flavoring but definitely not smoked. Not a BBQ joint however so will let those slide.  My Rating - Gumbos: outstanding, Etouffee: outstanding, Hurricane Shrimp: Very Good; Fritters: Pretty good,  CrabCake:  Not so Good; Wings: Okay; BBQ Pork Sliders: Pass  Definately will be going back to try some other items on their menu!  Hope this helped someone!",

So we turned to Yelp for guidance. And this time you hit it out of the ballpark with Baby Kay's! We have spent time in Cajun country of LA and were very surprised to find a Cajun restaurant right here in Mesa! The menu was on point and the seasoning of the dishes was just about perfect! Hubs had the fettuccine with shrimp and andouille sausage and he said it was delicious and the side was red beansand rice. And they were spot on! I ordered the catfish and also selected red beans and rice as my side. One twist (for us) was the offering of either courtboullion or etouffee for the fish. I ordered the etouffee. I could have it on the side or over the fish. I had it on the side but it would have been yummy on top. The catfish was some of the best I've ever had. Crisp coating but not heavy. And the fish was moist! Only disappointment was we were stuffed and didn't have room for the bread pudding with the whiskey sauce but we had really overdone the carbs so we will have to go back another time for that!",

    "text": "Baby K's is a good little Cajun joint off of Dobson Rd in Mesa. Nice ambience, live music, smiling servers and very good food makes the place definitely one of the best representatives of southern food in the east valley.  I tried the fried chicken special on Thursday night and it was excellent. Huge portions, moist breast meat, crispy chicken skin, lots of spices including perfect helpings of cayenne on the chicken made the dinner great. The dirty rice is a perfect side. I also tried the gumbo and jambalaya from a friend's plate and they were very tasty as well.  Definitely a place to check out if you like southern comfort food.",

We have been going to another Cajun restaurant for our etouffee fix for years and since we moved to Mesa we decided to give this a try. First of all, they have a great happy hour specials. We ordered the crawfish etouffe and the fried shrimp appetizer from the menu. WOW WOW!! We truly did enjoy each of the entrees. There is a reason why this restaurant still attracts great clientele. We will definitely be coming back for more of our Cajun fix. Thank you Baby Kay's!",

I got a to go order and I appreciated that the sandwich wasn't full assembled so it wouldn't get soggy. That said, even after I put it together it lacked that drip-down-your-arm goodness I expect from a po-boy. The bread wasn't crusty--it was very soft. The remoulade was very heavy on the horseradish.  I like lettuce, tomato, and pickles on a po-boy. My sandwich only came with two little tomato slices. I did find the pickles hiding under my fries after I was done with my sandwich. They were really tasty--wish I had found them sooner. The fries were crispy and had Cajun seasoning. The oysters were good enough, I'll come back but I'd probably get the platter and not the po-boy.",

LOVED the garlic bread that also accompanied my meal.  The portions are HUGE!  More than enough for dinner and leftovers.  I've been in Arizona for 4 years.  I love Cajun food.  I have no idea why it took me so long to try it.  One thing's for certain, it won't take me so long to go back.    Exceptional service!  I noticed there were LOTS of regulars dining there.  Some of the guest knew the servers by name and vice versa.  That was nice to see. I don't know if they have live music every night but they do for sure on Saturdays.  I must return soon!",

It definitely had a Nawlins  feel to the decor but was slightly lacking in that southern hospitality kind of attitude by the servers. The roux used in the gumbo watery and the chef  attempted to compensate with heat. Still, it was a reminder of home with this restaurants attempt and I give them a thumbs up. Maybe not two but every business has to start somewhere. Ill definitely try this place again down the road.",

For DinnerI had the Catfish Dinner, Red Beans and Rice, Gumbo, Crawfish Etoufee & Dirty Rice  and of course a Hurricane  Catfish had a great Crust on it, but it wasn't cooked all the way.... just the Crust inside the fish needed a little more attention. Red Beans and Rice was a real miss. I suggest go to NOLA and do some Samples.... Order some Camelia's and try again.  Gumbo was OK... nothing to write home about but it was do-able Etoufee was very good. I could go back and get me a big bowl of that. The Hurricane Drink was good... a little different from NOLA version but a good version.  I gave it 3 stars only because I know what real Creole food should taste like and I personally feel it's priced a little too high...  I do suggest going it's worth the trip and the meals are all do-able and the atmosphere is a good one. Service and was awesome too.",

The seafood gumbo and the crawfish etouffee was just the thing to give me my fix for that cajun craving! Way less work and mess than a boil like the kind at the Angry Crab. I felt like I got way more crawfish meat in the etouffee.  My husband got the fried combo basket with catfish, shrimp and clams. Light breading, very good. They know how to cook their shrimp here. I feel like they could skip the paper doilies though.  I love that they have vegetarian options too!",

Last Saturday my wife and I ate there to celebrate my birthday, what a great time.  Martin was the waiter and we were able to visit with one of the owners, Heather.  Well, we thought it might have been one of the owners, it might have been two of the owners, as Heather informed us that her twin sister also was a owner, but they had never pulled the twins game!  :-)    Anyway back to the burger, I have stayed away from it as blue cheese is not one of my favorite cheeses, but Martin recommended it so I trusted his recommendation.  So glad I did, it was outstanding, one of the best burgers I have had!!!!  Heather said it was her recipe so kudos for her for that.   I can say once again, love this place and it is one of our go to places in the Mesa, Dobson Ranch area.",

Walked in to the bar because that's where they told me to pick up at. I sat down for a good 5-10 mins before I was even helped. This was a Friday night and an hour before closing. It wasn't that busy at all. There was three people behind the bar but none seem to notice me . Service issue?  Anyways I was really looking forward to trying the chicken wings. I saw pictures and it looked great. Supposedly the chicken were suppose to be sweet and spicy. It tasted like they over did it with the honey  because it wasn't spicy at all. The chicken tasted old like it's been in the freezer for months. It wasn't juicy at all and super dry.   The crawfish etouffee was the only thing I could eat. It was my first so I couldn't compare it to other places but it had a nice kick to it and the crawfish was nice and meaty I had some pretty huge chunks of meat in there.  That's all I got I had high hopes for this place but that chicken wing ruined it.",

We had the chicken and sausage gumbo and pork po boy with sweet potato fries. The gumbo was well seasoned and had a great kick to it; both the chicken and sausage were tender. Po boy was delicious and so were the fries. Dessert looked absolutely delicious and massive, but we were way too full after dinner to try some! Will definitely have to save room next time. Portions were decently sized, especially if you're splitting two dishes it's more than enough to leave you feeling full and satisfied. We will be back soon!",

Firstly, the staff was wonderful and accommodating- a terrific bunch of people who provided great service to us.  Secondly, the music was great! There was an older gentleman playing some nice grooves on his guitar and we thoroughly enjoyed him!  As for the food? It was really good. I'm not well versed in Cajun food and this was really my first time eating it. I was impressed!  I had a hankering for fish that unfortunately had to go unsatisfied because the only fish they have on the menu here is catfish. Ugh. I am just not a fan of catfish at all! So instead, I ordered the shrimp po'boy sandwich with fries and a side of shrimp etoufee. I didn't eat the \"sandwich\" portion of the po'boy because they served it plain on a dry hoagie bun with only lettuce and tomato on the side. I'm trying to be \"selective\" with my carbs and it just wasn't appetizing enough for me to cheat. Instead, I ate the fried shrimp off the bun and found it to be delicious! Well-seasoned and cooked perfectly! The French fries were also very tasty. I hadn't ever eaten etoufee before, but I was pleasantly surprised! It was uniquely flavorful and scrumptious! I would have preferred more finely chopped onions (there were big onion hunks in this stuff), but other than that I really enjoyed it.  If Baby Kay's was closer to my neck of the woods, I'd be more likely to be a repeat customer because there were a lot of things on their menu I'd have loved to try. I'm not in the East Valley much but if I'm ever in the vicinity, Baby Kay's would be high on my list to go again!",

It is unusual for both my boyfriend and I to enjoy the same spice level, but these wings did it! He all but licked the plate.  I had the Georgia Peach cocktail. Very sweet but very delicious. Had two, and could not drive home. They do not skimp on the pour.  For dinner I ordered the Crawfish Etouffee with green olive coleslaw. I not a big green olive fan, but I heard it was one of their best sides. So for me to say it was good, even though I didn't finish it, is saying something. I also ordered it because the boy LOVES green olives. He devoured  what I didn't eat.  The Etouffee was my first and it was so good; spicy but I couldn't stop eating. Definitely had leftovers wit their portions.   The boy ordered the po'boy combo: Shredded pork po'boy with the duck & andouille gumbo. I had a bit of both, so delicious. He loved Remoulade. I believe it is horseradish.  I wouldn't call this place a hole in the wall, but it is not fine dinning. If you are only into that sort of putting, this place is not for you. But if you like great food and a fun atmosphere, this is a great place to try.  I did give them a 4 because it took a while for anybody to get to us to order and even though we ordered our starter and our mains separately, they came out on top of one another. It made things super crowded at our table and it meant our mains were cooling off. The wait staff did pack up my leftovers for me. So outside of those two minor blips, their staff was super attentive.",

    "text": "Having just been to New Orleans a few months ago, I think I'm kind of ruined on Cajun food anywhere else. This place is located in a strip mall, and the building left quite a bit to be desired. There was a lot of cool art on the walls inside made by local artists that was for sale at reasonable prices. If I would've had an easy way to get a painting home, I would have bought one!   The food was just ok. I had the crawfish etoufee which had a decent spice level to it, but it was extremely thick and had a weird texture to it that I had trouble getting past. One of the people with me ordered shrimp etoufee and it was extremely soupy and has barely any shrimp. It was a pale yellow color and looked like chicken noodle soup, which was odd compared to what I've experienced in the past. Since the rue base is usually the same for these two items, it was strange to see the color and consistency so drastically different. My friend commented that the shrimp etoufee was not very spicy after he tried my dish. Also, I will note that I was supposed to get a side dish with my entree, but it never arrived. The entree portion was huge, so I didn't miss it. However, it would have been nice since it was on the menu and I ordered it.  Overall, this isn't a bad stop and I have no idea what other Cajun places exist in this area so it's an ok option if it's your chance for some Cajun food. It definitely doesn't live up to actual New Orleans food, though, but I'm not sure if anything could!",

    "text": "This is the best Cajun Food in Arizona.  While I would agree with other reviewers that the whole menu is top notch, I will add that the Crawfish Etouffee is shockingly authentic.  Even in New Orleans you will be hard pressed to find better Etouffee and Baby Kay's would impress any Yat.  I will be interested to see what the new location looks like when all the work is complete, but even the current setup still has a real New Orleans vibe.  Recommendation: Visit at happy hour.  I have eaten at Baby Kay's for years and always eat off the dinner or po'boy menu, but happy hour is quite good.  The wings/etoufee/gumbo/sliders are perfect to go with your drinks and the portions are quite generous.  This is a great way to get a taste of NOLA.",

Now saying that if you eat at the tourist traps on bourbon street and like their food you will be blown away with Baby Kays.  Get the Cajun Combo and you wont be disappointed a healthy sample of Gumbo, Etouffee, and Jambalaya. The Rene wings are great if you are looking for something different as wings go. The Smothered Pork Chops are amazing and BBQ Shrimp are great. Lots to choose from and the only Cajun Restaurant in Phoenix that serves real Cajun Food.  Will always be my Go To Cajun place",

A few nights ago I ate there with two other people and the restaurant was only about half full.  We were all very hungry, so I asked if we could have our garlic bread straight away.  Of course, says the waitress.  15 minutes later - no bread.  I asked again and it finally came out.  How hard can it be to toast bread and smear it with garlic butter????  Poor performance, especially since it was not busy.  The drinks were equally slow to come out.  I don't understand what is so complicated about pulling a draft beer!!!  The food is generally pretty good, especially the crawfish sauce you can get with your catfish - really great.  The jambalaya leaves a bit to be desired, however.  Too dry and starchy.  The red beans are good, though, as is the catfish, albeit a bit heavy on the batter.  Oh, I grew up in Cajun country, so I know how it should be prepared.",

    "text": "Knowing that authentic, high quality Cajun food is not that easy to find around Phoenix, I was excited to try Baby Kay's as soon as I found out about it.  I was very impressed with Baby Kay's and will be adding it to my regular rotation of restaurants.   To begin, the food is exceptional.  The fried catfish is flaky and falls apart very easily, as all good catfish should.  If I had one complaint, it would be that there was a little too much salt in the batter, but it did not severely hamper my enjoyment of the meal.  The serving size is very large and would be enough for 2 dinners.  The entrees also come with either a side salad, potato salad, or coleslaw.  I chose the potato salad, which was very good, but I did not eat much of it because I was focused on the catfish.  It is well worth paying the extra $3.00 for the crawfish sauce.    The pricing is very fair for the portion size and quality of the food.  I ordered the fried catfish dinner with crawfish sauce, which was about $20.  However, this was one of the most expensive items on the menu.  Many of the options are around $10.00 to $15.00.  All the serving sizes were very large, as well, and the food was well worth the price.    The ambiance and atmosphere of Baby Kay's is one of the main reasons that I will continue to come back.  There is an elderly man who plays live guitar during dinner and it is quite enjoyable.  He plays with a backing track and the music is just at the right volume where you can have a good dinner conversation and still enjoy the music.  I may even end up eating here again by myself at some point because the music is so enjoyable that I could focus on it for a whole dinner.  The restaurant also has a sort-of \"hidden\" vibe to it, which I thought was cool.  The windows are blacked out and you cannot see in from the outside.  When I first got there I thought they were closed.  Once I opened the door and saw that every table was full and the guitarist was playing I was a little bit surprised.  It was almost like a scene out of a movie.    The service was great, as well.  Our drinks were always refilled before we even noticed that we needed them.  In addition, they bring an extra vase with about another one and a half glasses of the drink, so refills are never a problem.  The food came quickly and, despite it being crowded, we were given a lot of attention.  Overall, there is no reason that I can think of to not come back to Baby Kay's.  I look forward to many more trips here and trying more of the menu, including some of the specials that were written on the wall.",

Then the waiter was kind enough to explain what some of the options were. Since I had never really had cajun. Once we put our order in of the Fried Shrimp with Dirty Rice & The Seafood Gumbo, it was given to us in maybe 5-10 mins. There was hardly any wait! The food & service was amazing!!! They have a gentleman who was playing blues music live which made for a Great atmosphere!  We will definitely be back!! This is a restaurant YOU HAVE TO VISIT!!!",

They are breaded, fried and drenched in a honey Tabasco type sauce that is literally finger licking good.  I'll order garlic bread just to mop up the leftover sauce with.  The first time we came here was on a Saturday night and I ordered their daily special which was the Smothered Pork Chop dinner.  It comes with a side of warm bourbon fruit cocktail and my 2 sides I chose was the dirty rice and the potato salad.  I swear the pick chop was a double cut thick chop smothered in a brown gravy.  The pork was so tender you did not need a knife to cut it.  The dirty rice had a nice kick to it and the potato salad was a nice compliment to the meal.  4 days later we came back for Happy Hour.  I had the wings again and had a shrimp n oyster poboy with house made potato chips.  A very meaty sandwich and the chips were tasty.  I can't wait to try their jambalaya next.",

Our waitress was very attentive, kind, and helpful. It was nice because all of the waiting staff helped each other out, so drinks weren't empty for long, and we got our plates bussed as soon as we were done. The food was absolutely delicious: I got the Cajun Combo, but the stand-out there was the Crawfish Etouffe. It had a nice little kick to it. Paired with a New Orleans beer and the complimentary garlic bread, this meal was the epitome of satisfying. Highly recommend this place--I will certainly return soon.",

Eating anywhere is Arizona, or anywhere outside of New Orleans for that matter, I don't expect much. I usually expect for something to be called one thing but be another (like in flagstaff I got a \"crab cake poboy\" but it came on a brioche bun! What the heck!!). Here at Baby Kay's, I got crawfish etouffee and a shrimp poboy. Baby, it taste just like home! I was in shock and wished I didn't order half orders. Best creole food in AZ hands down.  two thumbs up from me!!",

One day I stopped in after I was craving some good Cajun food and the place was shut down. Well my craving came back and noticed this Cajun place was back in the same spot but under a different name. Shout out to Kate M.!! I read her review and I was salivating of all the nice things she had to say about this place and the photos she posted so I had to give it a try.   When we first walked in I noticed the music they were placing and it definitely gave it a Louisiana feel. The place isn't very big but comfortably spaced so you don't feel like you will smack the person behind you if you turn around too quick. We were immediately greeted by hostess who seated us in a nice location so that we could get a good view of the rest of the place since this was my first time here. We ordered cup of chicken gumbo as I was so eager to satisfy my Cajun craving.  Didn't take too long and the food came with a side of their succulent garlic bread. Gumbo was super good and I wish I would have ordered the bowl but I didn't want to get too full because there were so many other things I wanted to try. I ended up ordering the shrimp etouffee which was good but it had an overwhelming amount of onions. I can definitely say I will be back to try other things on the menu but gumbo is a must.   Great fast service and great place for Cajun food.",

The windows are shaded really dark to keep out the Arizona sun's heat which is great, but misleading. We walked in expecting it to be dim mood lighting and jazz music but instead it was really bright and open. Not very private and romantic, which was what i was hoping it would be. Really took from the ambience. Im hoping they set up some mood lighting to go with the jazz theme. :) and maybe a couple booths.   But that's just how I'd like it, maybe they're going for a dif mood. :)  Either way, get those delicious hush puppies!!",

    "text": "On a date here Saturday night.  We ate the crawfish etouffee and shrimp basket while listening to live jazz music.  The crawfish was definitely frozen.  It did not take fresh at all.  Compared to the crawfish etouffee I normally get in South Houston close to Galveston Bay, this would be barely edible.  However I understand we are in Valley so it is what it is.  The shrimp basket was good and the homemade chips were great.  I'd give that 4-stars.  Service was good here.  Drinks were horribly made.  I returned the hurricane and painkiller.  I felt bad after returning the first 2 drinks and kept the third (renee margarita), even though it was just as bad as the first drink.  Don't try drinks here.  If I rated this restaurant to Houston's top crawfish places, it would rate a 1-star.  If rated to New Orleans best places, it would rate a zero.  Update: I don't like wasting food as I ate a couple bites Saturday night so I brought it home. Upon heating it on the stove for lunch at noon the next day, I felt bad for the rest of the day after eating it.  Won't be coming back.  Maybe some things should be thrown away.",

With that being said, I was disappointed in the red beans and rice or chicken and sausage gumbo. I go to New Orleans all the time and I love red beans and rice and gumbo! So I was excited to try this place here in Arizona. My only complaint with this restaurant is that the food wasn't seasoned well and I had to add a lot of salt, and the rice was hard. Not crunchy hard, but I like my rice soft. It reminded me of the 5 minute boil-in-a-bag rice. My dad has the seafood basket and he said it was delicious and their horseradish sauce was spicy and delicious. The staff was nice and attentive. And they have a chalk board with daily specials for both lunch and dinner. If I go back, it would be for the Lulu wings and live music.",

You also get a side and garlic bread. All three dishes were delicious, I chose a side of green olive slaw. Which was mouthwatering, and my dad got a salad. My mom got dirty rice, and I tried a bite of that as well!! It was so yummy! My husband got the creole burger he said is was good! The flavor was great. Kids got random dishes but I do have to say that was some of the best cajun food I have ever had! The bread pudding was pretty good too. The server was awesome, she was knowledgeable and so sweet.

My friends had ordered a sampler appetizer that came with battered shrimp, hush puppies, and fried oysters - it was awesome. I ordered the delicious seafood gumbo cup, the other option was a bowl but I knew I wouldn't finish it. I tried the fettuccine alfredo one of my buds ordered and it was probably the best pasta I've had in a long time. My other friends had ordered combination plates so I tried the seafood etoufee that had huge pieces of crab and shimp in it, I should've ordered my own! I'm not sure how many nights a week they have it but there was a live jazz musician playing near the front entrance and it transformed the atmosphere into how I imagine most places in New Orleans really are. 11/10.",

When you first open the door to the restaurant you will be greeted with loud live music. I think the best course of action is to lower the volume because often time you cannot hear the person next to you talk. The staffs are very friendly and helpful with menu questions. Unfortunately, after being served food cold twice leads me to believe the resturant just microwave my order up leaving a bad taste in my mouth.   Jambalaya: Did not like it as much as the gumbo. Crawfish Etouffee: My favorite dish from their menu. Chicken and Sausage Gumbo: The gumbo was very tasty and I enjoyed it a lot.

They deliver consistant high quality food, I'm always super impressed with their Lulu wings.  They're breaded, fried and tossed in a fantastic sweet spicy sauce.  The wings themselves are also of high quality, I've never found any place in the valley that serves wings with so much meat on them, they aren't sacrificing quality to provide a reasonable price happy hour here.  I also recommend happy hour for the sampling of so many good things, split a cup of chicken gumbo or a cup of Etouffee and some of the sliders.  Everything is palate pleasing.  Don't forget dessert, get the chocolate bourbon sunday.  And make sure you're splitting it at least 4 ways, its massive and super sweet!  We are also ice tea people, some places get it right and some don't, its the good stuff here.  Doesn't have to be flashy to compliment a good meal!  The staff is also great, they really seem to care and somehow even import a little of that New Orleans charm (if ya know what I mean).",

I just live their gumbo.  Lots of meat and lots of spices and heat. The crawfish ettouffe is also a signature  dish. Lots of meat and lots of flavors.  Service is always attentive  and the jazz music is great background",

    "text": "Having recently relocated from the North Valley to Fountain Hills, we had to find some new places to eat! We were introduced to Baby Kay's by good friends a few months ago and we just can't get enough!!  Our journey began with the Boudin Balls - amazing sausage croquette style appetizers with HEATED apricot jam. WOW! The jam itself is something I had to get the recipe for! The cup of Seafood Gumbo was large enough for me to split with my hubby - and the flavors were amazing! Crawfish Etouffee was a great base for the fried shrimp dinner!  Hubby ordered the Fried Chicken (Special on Thursdays) and the seasoning was hot and flavorful - crispy as always! I tried a friend's catfish & was pleasantly surprised - since I'm not a fish eater - it was pretty good!  Dessert - well that HUGE Chocolate Bourbon Sundae was shared by all 4 of us!  Before I finish I MUST mention the drinks! Try one of the house specials - they hit a home run with them every time! Bring s designated driver - because they pack a PUNCH!  A special p.s. to our waiter most nights - Martine' (pronounced Marteeen) BEST SERVICE EVER!! Consistent quality, service and so far not one bad experience. Need I say the place is spotless, funky, jazzy in a New Orleans way - OK I just did! BonAppetite!! Our FAVORITE PLACE ! Worth the drive!",

I was especially enamored by the etouffee. \"Etouffee\" means, \"smothered,\" and yo, you can etouffee me with their crawfish etouffee all day! Yum! The gumbo was pretty good. It was rich, had good flavor, and the duck was so tender. That Cajun Mary wasn't my cup of tea though. Too smoky, too acidic, and way too much pepper. I really wish the waitress got me the Cajun Mule I had ordered as I left my Cajun Mary mainly untouched at the table.  This place could be a fais-do-do with its live music. It's a dark and kinda dingy hole-in-the-wall but they have crispy flavorful chicken and an etouffee that'll make yo mama an' them happy and full. Get your Cajun eats here!

Now, if you're into the blues music, you'll love this restaurant right off the bat (like my husband who couldn't stop signing along). Thank goodness we had an easy-going server because we took our SWEET time deciding too. We ended up getting a variety of dishes, but the Gumbo, jambalaya, and po boys were the faves. I seriously could have licked my gumbo bowl clean, I enjoyed it that much.   I will warn that most dishes pack a punch of heat, but they do offer a few items for the more faint at heart so everyone can have a good meal. Prices are nice too, and I regret not trying the bread pudding but I hear it's awesome!",

We had such a great time despite the lengthy visit!   Forewarning they do not take reservations on Mardi Gras, but if you aren't in a rush, post up at the bar, have a festive drink and enjoy the sights and smells of Baby Kay's while you wait (or on any other day with a wait). It was great to have live music and everyone be in a jovial mood on the special holiday. Hurricanes are a must when you come to Baby Kay's as well as delicious hush puppies with some of their nose-watering horseradish sauce.   While the entire menu sounded good, the only thing I was solely interested in was shrimp etoufee. And it was worth the wait. Does not look like the most appealing bowl of food, but it certainly was satisfying and satiating. There was a perfect balance of spice and heat, complemented with juicy shrimp. I only wish I could've finished the entire bowl, but it filled me up quickly. While the four of us caught our breaths, our waitress brought up dessert. And happened to pass by with a few selections. We went with bread pudding, something I wasn't much of a fan of before, but with their warm alcoholic butter sauce.... I was hooked!   You are guaranteed a good evening and a hearty meal at Baby Kay's- and I look forward to returning many times for that!",

The lulu wings are always nice and crispy but I remember them to be more spicy that super sweet so that was a tttaadd off for me.

    "text": "So I love gumbo but I've never had it authentic till now? They advertise as being authentic but since I've never had it beforehand I'm not quite sure. It definitely tastes different than what I'm used to (but spoiler alert it's delicious). The waitress is friendly and checks up on you often. Apparently her boyfriend is from New Orleans and loves the crawfish etouffee and seafood gumbo. So if he likes it, then I'm pretty sure it's authentic.  Besides authenticity, the gumbo and etouffee are delicious! They are worth every bite. Both dishes highlight its main ingredient-- they don't skimp out either! If you're wondering the difference between gumbo and etouffee, gumbo is more like a soup (a thinner consistency) and etouffee is a stew (thicker than gumbo). The duck gumbo has a bit of a kick to it whereas the crawfish etouffee is a flavor blast of crawfish.  I'd say skip out on the jambalaya. It's not what you'd expect when ordering it. It's like plainly seasoned rice with andouille sausage.  My boyfriend ordered the alligator and clam basket. I took a quick bite and it was decent.  I'm definitely coming back here again for more gumbo and etouffee (and to try their crab cakes). I came during happy hour and they have a good selection of beer. Next time I'll come when they have live music.",

Things I've had that I could easily eat every day; Cajun Burger, Po Boy, Gumbo, hushpuppies and the Alfredo.   The place is in a small strip down on Dobson. Parking isn't limited, they also have a small outdoor patio to enjoy the wonderful atmosphere.   Fried chicken is also off the chain, they normally have it on weekly specials.

Speaking of, Bae ordered a side of crawfish with the sauce.  He wanted to try the etouffee since we had an amazing one in Huntsville, we were hoping to find a good local dish.  The waiter suggested the side which is essentially the etouffee minus the rice.  It was good, more seafoody than the Huntsville version.  Neither of us are big on seafood but it was still good.  Overall, Baby Kay's had a cute (but wide open and well-lit) atmosphere with great music and good food.  Would recommend to anyone looking for some genuine cajun food here in the southwest.",

    "text": "Laissez les bon temps rouler at Baby Kay's! I love cajun/Louisiana style cuisine and was excited to try out this restaurant based on the good reviews and close proximity to my house. The last time I had eaten Cajun food at a restaurant was actually in New Orleans. :) We ordered some hush puppies, boudin balls, I had the Cajun combination and shared some bread pudding.  The hush puppies and boudin balls were perfectly crispy on the outside, with tender filling. I loved the boudin balls. They tasted exactly like those I had in New Orleans. The Cajun combination was a great way to taste all the typical Louisiana style dishes. The crawfish etouffee was my favorite of the three bowls. The jambalaya was interesting in that it wasn't tomato based, so for me it tasted more like a Cajun spiced fried rice. Quite honestly I've had so many different versions of this dish (With a few that I've tried in Louisiana) it's still hard for me to say what a typical jambalaya is supposed to taste like. It tasted decent, but the rice was very slightly undercooked and thus very slightly crunchy tasting. I had the chicken and sausage gumbo which was flavorful and filled with meat and veggies. I tried my friend's seafood gumbo which was by far superior due to the smoky, intense flavor from the dark roux. I also loved the complimentary garlic bread which was buttery, garlicky, toasty heaven.  The bread pudding was a sizable chunk and came with a bowl of whiskey sauce (We asked for it on the side). It was thick, dense, and filled with a ton of ingredients such as nuts and shredded coconut. The sauce was very light and tasted more like very lightly sweet, watery whiskey.  Service was good and our drinks were filled as needed. Our waitress had the foresight to ask if we wanted separate checks or one single bill since we were a party of 6 which I appreciated.   We went here on a Friday night and they had a musician singing and playing music, which might be a draw for some, but not so much if you are looking for more of a quiet environment where you can chat with friends. Good performance nonetheless by the musician.  I'll definitely come here if I'm craving Cajun style food for that lovely etouffee and seafood gumbo.",

    "text": "It is food adventure time or my friends and I again. This time, we were on our quest to try this newly opened Cajun food. When we first walked in, we saw a local musician playing music in the general dining area (what a great way to start our dining experience). The restaurant was extremely busy during business hour and that also means the food is good to me. We started our meal with two different appetizers. I forgot the name of the other one, but one of them was Boudin Balls. I love the apricot-pepper Jelly sauce and the crab cakes was absolutely delicious. As for dinner, I ordered a cajun combination that comes with crawfish etouffee, chicken and sausage jambalaya and substitute seafood gumbo over chicken with a side of green olive salad. All 3 of them were absolutely delicious, especially the crawfish etouffee. I didn't care for the green olive salad but my company seems to like it.   To complete the cajun dining experience, we ordered a bread pudding dessert and split it between all 6 of us. It was very tasty. If i wasn't so full, I would have probably ordered one just for myself. The reason i didn't give it a 5 star is because our server kept interrupting our conversation every time she came by. I even tried speaking very loudly to my friend the last time she came over and she managed to talk over me anyway. Argh! Can't you wait a little or say \"excuse me\" at least...?  Overall, I do enjoy my dining experience here and will definitely come back here again.",

The \"etouffee\" I ordered was very much like a watered-down version of the filling in a Stouffers chicken pot pie - no pepper or spice of any kind and certainly no roux.  Then there were like 6-7 really puny shrimp buried in this mysterious liquid and the whole thing had this nasty old restaurant smell. It seemed really old.  I felt really ripped off by the $16.95 price & kept wondering if I had stumbled into an episode of Kitchen Nighmares!

The hushpuppies were ok, kind of like Long John Silver's hushpuiies. The horseradish sause was excellent though.  The service this night was not very good. We waited almost 1 1/2 hours to get our entrees. The server steered clear of us most of the night, which made us angrier. If she would have communicated and offered a salad or something to tide us over, we would have understood.  We finally get our food and it is average at best. My wife's po-boy and gumbo were cold. My shrimp basket had 8 measly shrimp on it. We were really hoping for better, especially after the wait.  After our experience, we don't know how this place gets such good reviews.. food and service not good.",

Had the wings followed by catfish covered in crawfish Etouffee, garlic bread, and jambalaya all while listening to a live soul-blues musician. Ambiance was way more quaint and personal than I expected from a strip mall location. Kyle our server made excellent recommendations and remained attentive without being overbearing. Can't wait for the craw-fish to come in or Thursday chicken fry.",

Not bad, just...different. I'm always down for new and different. Prob wouldn't order again though.  I think my only disappointment is in the limited menu. Various Catfish, etouffe, gumbo, jamabalaya, po' boy, and salads. That's about it.   The previous Cajun business that was in this location was, IMO, superior. Bigger menu variety with better prices. I'm sad that its gone. It was damn good, but again, so is this.   Overall, yum!",

I'm adding photos of Norma's lagniappe salad (\"lagniappe\" is a New Orleans word for a little extra, in this case Cajun sausage as well as bacon and a multitude of other goodies in the salad. I had Cajun fried catfish with a crawfish etouffe sauce, plus garlic toast and a choice of potato salad, olive cole slaw, or a side salad. I got a free dessert, sweet potato pie, lighter than more traditionally seasoned pumpkin pie, and Norma had key lime pie. A musician playing a fiddle and then a guitar to taped music was a delightful accompaniment, his New Orleans style songs adding so much to the background.",

If your an diehard Cajun cooking lover than this place is for you.  Super friendly staff told us about there plan to take over the next door store as well and a patio.   Nice to have another awesome food place in the area and nice to be the first on here to highly recommend it to everyone.",

Since I couldn't make up my mind, I ended up with the cajun combo that was delicious.

If it had been busy I could understand the need to rush, however it was not busy not to mention the attitude in facial expressions. I requested gumbo and placed an order for a entree which she mentioned a place in the combo selection she could modify to get what I wanted. I then was trying to understand the difference in the two items to see see if maybe I wanted something else but when I asked questions she told me \"well I'll just take care of it on this end.\" On top of that before she walked away I asked for my gumbo first she said \"well it's all ready to go at the same time, do you not want them at the same time?\"   Long story short I have no idea what I ended up with as to opposed to what I ordered. I was unable to understand the menu as I felt like I was a pain in the butt customer for even asking questions. And getting another drink and a fork was an issue short of jumping up and down.

The beer selection here is simply not good; they carried only one ipa from Abita,  and it was marginal at best.    We shared an order of hush puppies and the cajun combination plate with seafood etouffe, chicken and sausage gumbo and jambalaya. The hush puppies were super delicious! The combo plate however left us both wanting. We both loved the etouffe, thought the jambalaya was just okay and didn't like the gumbo at all. I tried a few times but there is some sort of spice that was sweet and overpowered the dish.   We did enjoy the live music and the very relaxed atmosphere. I won't be running back here, but might try the etouffe again sometime.",

Service was very good and people were friendly.  Prices reasonable.  Bread pudding wasn't great, though - way too firm for my taste.

Hubby had the chicken gumbo, he thought the flavor was good but nothing special.  - chocolate cake was a refrigerated Costco slice sold, resold for $7 a slice when the entire cake is only $16 (been a member for 10 years it's my fav choco cake so I know it when I have it).

My wife had the jambalaya a la carte - her personal favorite - and ordered a side of crawfish sauce to pour on top of the jambalaya. She was raving over it! Her recommendation is, if you like crawfish, THAT is the way to do it!! If not, the jambalaya by itself is absolutely delicious!   We will certainly go back. They have awesome sounding specials including tender pork chops, and seafood enchiladas. We are also excited about the live music. Happy hour deals are great as well!

We had Damien as a server who was awesome, attentive and sweet. He was swamped with a lot of tables but we noticed he catered to each one evenly. We had a cup of chicken and sausage gumbo, and crab cakes for an app which were both SO good. And we had the fried seafood baskets too. My boyfriend got the fried oysters which neither of us enjoyed but that's okay. The love music was on point. And everything overall was a good experience. We definitely  be back!",

We made it to the place of business waited over a hour to be seated that was to be expected.  Took over 30 minutes for the waitress to come take our drink order. Took another 30 min  for her to bring our drinks after taking our order. Waitress seem like she was upset not friendly at all. Finally bought our drinks took our orders. Now a hour has past no waitress to chk on us not once to see how we are doing another hour goes by my family getting very upset. I go ask for the manager. She comes out 20 min later. I explain the type of service I was receiving explained I have never experienced bad service here before. Been waitting for our food over 2 hours.  Other customers got food before us three other tables. The manager stated to me what am I suppose to do. No apology it will be right out nothing.Then our food came out seem that it had been sitting in the kitchen for awhile it's now cold catfish half done. What made me feel the most uncomfortable is when the manager of this place of business tells me what am I suppose to do. Bad service all around I paid for the drinks all food that was served that was not eaten was left on the table.. No appology..",

The food though, that makes up for anything you could ever find wrong. Seriously, it's that good.   I tried the chicken and sausage gumbo, the jambalaya, and the crawfish etouffee. All three were amazing. The etouffee was to die for. I could have eaten that for hours. It came with garlic bread and salad. The garlic bread is killer too. Seasoned perfectly. The salad was great. Tried it with a mango habanero dressing.  Service was outstanding. For a group of 20 people, they served us beautifully as if we were a small crowd. Overall an absolutely fantastic place.   We went with a large group as part of our Friday night foodies group. There was not one person who didn't rant about how good everything was. We have been to a variety of over 20 different Restaurants and this was by far everyone's favorite. Some even said we should stop going to other places and go here instead EVERY WEEK.  Don't just think about going here. Get the keys, jump in your car and go! It's just that good.",

    "text": "I've been waiting to update my review until after I got myself back over here to try their Thursday night fried chicken.  I'm convinced there is nothing bad on this menu.  There isn't even anything just ok or mediocre.  It's all great.  My husband and I sat at the bar last night after a long day of work.  It seriously should have been Friday yesterday.  Sure felt like it.  The sign out front said, \"a hurricane will take away your pain\".  OK.  Two hurricanes.  And an order of LuLu wings please.    Ah.  The world goes away.  The man and woman taking turns working behind the bar are so friendly and funny that it's hard to stay in a bad mood.  And there was a father/son pair sitting at my left elbow and they were fun to talk to as well.  This was their first visit to Baby Kay's and they enjoyed what they ate, but they were eyeballing our wings, so I gave them one.  They said, \"We know what to order next time!  Those wings are delicious!\"  Yes they are.    We also ordered the fried chicken dinner which is perfect to share because it's a half chicken, 2 sides, and some garlic bread.  We got ours with the green olive cole slaw and dirty rice.  We also tried Abita's Andygator which is a helles doppelbock.  What?!?!  Somebody pinch me!  Am I drinking beer in Germany with Cajun music in the background?  Loved the dinner and the beer.  Great all around.    Since my last review, we were also in on a Saturday night for the smothered pork chop special.  That pork chop is nothing short of amazing.  It's so tender it just falls apart, and is covered with a rich brown gravy.  Mmmm...mmmm...that's some good eatin', Clark.  I want to go back and get that for sure.  So, yeah.  Still great food and great service.  Baby Kay's has become one of our favorite places.",

    "text": "Baby Kay's Cajun Kitchen 2051 S Dobson Rd Mesa, AZ 85202  I had not eaten at Baby Kay's since it was located at Town and Country Shopping Center a long time ago. It was time for a new review.  Companion and I arrived at lunch time and were seated immediately. Our waitress took our orders for drinks and provided the requisite menu's for us to peruse. Most of the food on the menu appeared to be authentic Nola, at least if the taste held up to the descriptions.   Companion wasn't up on Cajun food, and asked if she could sample one or two things she was considering. Because heat from spice was not something companion enjoyed, she wanted to make sure she would be able to eat what she ordered. Our waitress promptly brought out 3 small cups with etouffee, jambalaya, and swamp water (gumbo for you northerners). Companion tasted all 3 and decided on the etouffee. I couldn't resist tasting them also. The jambalaya had some nice heat but no tomato in it, and the gumbo was True to tradition.  We each started with a cup of etouffee. We were brought plates with some excellent garlic bread on it along with a small bowl of the etouffee. Adding a bit of hot sauce to it and I was in New Orleans! A wonderful broth loaded with crawfish tails with a nice ball of white rice in the center. Companion ate her bowl without hot sauce and fell in love with it. This was the start of a wonderful lunch.  I got the combination basket which had fried shrimp and fried oysters in it along with the most unusual cole slaw I have ever eaten. There is no doubt in my mind that the chef who prepared this basket really knew what he was doing, as the shrimp and oysters were cooked to perfection. Companion had never eaten fried oysters before, and after one taste pronounced them delicious and decided to help me eat mine! The word thief comes to mind. The breading was perfect, and the oysters were a nice size and perfectly creamy. The shrimp, which most places overcook until they resemble something made from butyl rubber, were beautifully prepared, and were delicately tender. As for the cole slaw, what made it so unique is that it is prepared using green olives as one of the seasonings. It was highly unusual, and I still haven't made up my mind whether I like it or not. I'll probably have to go back a few more times to sample it some more.  We finished off lunch with their bread pudding in a puddle of whisky sauce. The bread pudding was dense, covered in pecans, and had coconut in it. I was so full that I could only eat a small amount of it, and companion asked for a box to take it in.  There was only one downer for the lunch, and that was a Sazerac that was ordered from the bar. Unfortunately, it just didn't make the grade and had to be sent back. My understanding is that they used to have a bartender that made a terrific one, and when she left they stopped making the drink. I'm hoping in the future they get a bartender that can make a proper Sazerac cocktail.  The place was clean, airy, with excellent service. Those who wish to can eat outside. Each table had a selection of hot sauces, mostly from Tabasco. I would suggest that they have some Louisiana Hot Sauce available also, as it has a totally different flavor than Tabasco.   For those who might be inclined to say that this is an expensive place to eat, may I remind them that this is the desert and sea food has to be brought in and is also costly. It all adds up in the end.  4 Stars",

If I could I would eat here everyday ;) I am beyond thrilled to have found a piece of home so far from my home.",

The following is what was ordered:  We ordered the following:  1) A Cup of Seafood Gumbo 2) One Cajun Combination (seafood gumbo, jambalaya, and crawfish etoufee)  Most of it was okay, except for the following:  The gumbo was too salty.  My wife even said it was too salty.  Also, the seafood and crawfish did not taste fresh enough.    Otherwise it was okay.  My wife's comment was, \"She has had better Cajun food in Chicago, and elsewhere.\"   The food was okay though.",

I ordered a salad with the apricot habanero dressing. It was not a dressing but a jam. You could not pour it. My husband used it as a spread for his bread.  My daughter had crab cakes, which were greasy and no flavor.   The serve was also just okay.  The server who brought our dinner asked if we received every thing as she walked away. My daughter had not received her whole meal. We had to flag her down. She said she would check on it and walked over to another table and never did check. Finally another person brought her meal.  My husband and I go to  New Orleans annually and this was not a Orleans experience in food or serve.",

Spices were perfect, portion size was good (having the 2nd half for lunch and it's even better). Drink menu was good- had an Irish Mule- and my husband had a Hurricane. Only disappointing thing was the bread pudding and mostly because it wasn't what I was expecting. Dense and flavorful but somewhat dry. Will get the bourbon sundae next time. Great experience- I will definitely go back.",

Then looking at Bill they had charged one of our people full price for crab cakes when they were ordered as happy hour appetizer.  Let's see13.00  verses 5.00 for happy hour.  Waiter said it was miscommunication between said person and him (waiter). No just him.  Now for food... Crab cakes had no flavor,  hush puppies were awesome.  Sauce for them awesome.  . Red beans and rice with andouille sausage was very very good very spicy good flavor salad was good . The fried chicken was good dirty rice was good the wings are awesome would I go back ?
