    "text": "Great '50s retro with food to match.  Servings were large for the price.  Service was superb (I wish I could remember her name).  I ordered the cherry coke and it knocked my socks off.  It was so real '50's, like I remember.  They didn't hold back on the real cherry syrup.  I also think they use Coke made with real sugar.  I will have to ask next time.   My wife had the Valentine's shake which she said was great.  Real vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup, and that cherry syrup.  It also had about 1/2 dozen cherries in it.  We split the BLT club sandwich and that, with the mound of very crisp fries, filled both of us up.  Don't miss this diner!  (PS I rarely ever give 5 stars.)",

    "text": "Let me start by saying this place is 24 hours! Skip Denny's and go here, the food is soooo much better.  I love their first Friday's every month with live rockabilly, or country, or 50's era inspired bands. There is such a mix of ages there dancing and hula hooping it is a blast! My daughter is 5 and loves going to listen to the music, dance, and hula hoop. People drive their classic cars out, I've even seen a vintage trailer there. (The Scottsdale location does this on the 3rd Friday of the month too.)   The staff here is always super nice and friendly. I have always had the best service. For a date night try splitting the turkey club sandwich (this sandwich is huge btw) and a milkshake, it will fill you both up and only cost you about $15! For the kids they are served their meal in a cool classic car (my daughter has started to collect them she likes them so much).",

    "text": "Had some high hopes for this one. Charming 50's diner decor meets breakfast/burger place with killer shakes?! C'mon, what's there not to want? Well, my wife and I just left disappointed. We probably won't be coming back here again.   We got greeted by the waitstaff immediately, friendly with smiles (the reason they aren't getting a 1 star rating), and got seated right away. We were told the specials that evening and our waiter came shortly thereafter. We were never given silverware, we had to ask for them. Next, they got my order wrong. Instead of onion rings they gave me fries. Still not a big deal, but getting a little irritated. Then my wife only took one bite of her burger and couldn't finish it. The sauce on it was horrible she said. The bacon on it was also unappetizing to say the least. The only redeeming quality of this place was the shake. My chicken sandwich wasn't anything to write home about, but edible.   Finally as we are trying to wait patiently for the check, they buss boy and our waiter were right behind us cleaning up the table across from us and were throwing the plates and cups into their cart, seriously without a care in the world that they were making super annoyingly loud sounds right in our ears. Get real, how would you like it if I threw some plates and mugs around right next to your ear and hope you enjoy your dining experience.   The waiter kind of knew what was up when he saw she didn't finish and barely touched her plate. He assumed we wanted boxes for the once bitten burger and we politely declined. The only saving grace of this place was the shake.   Like I said before, we probably won't be coming back.",

Our booth was covered in crumbs, shredded lettuce, other people's hair, and even dirty silverware between the cushions. It was gross. We only stayed to eat because there was nowhere else to go and we were hungry, but it was disgusting. The waitstaff does not seem so busy that they couldn't take a minute between customers to clean the booths and make sure that the next guests won't have to sit in filth.

    "text": "A New Year's Eve hot chocolate hunt brought myself and two friends here around 2am.  Although the place was pretty busy, we were seated almost immediately in a booth. It was only after being seated that I really got to take in the decor; total 1950's tin can diner from soup to nuts. The waitresses looked like they had just stepped out of Grease, there was a counter lined with stationary stools behind which you could see the cooks working away, and every booth had a mini jukebox where you could enter in songs that would play over the sound system. I loved it! Even more than that, our waitress was exceptionally attentive.  We got our orders put in not two minutes after being seated - two hot chocolates, a sprite, one Marilyn's Bread Pudding, and one Waffle Wonder. Our drinks came out first; my friend and I who each ordered the hot chocolate were at first delighted at how much whipped cream topped them off, but were quickly disappointed to find that the chocolate itself seemed to be made with water instead of milk. :(  Shortly after our beverages came our desserts. The bread pudding was devoured and got my bread pudding loving friend's seal of approval. The Waffle Wonder was shared, and as someone who doesn't like usually like sweet on sweet desserts I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it! The fudge, caramel, and whipped cream were straight out of my childhood, the fat scoop of vanilla ice cream was melting lusciouslly into the warm waffle, and the cinnamon was the perfect bit of spice.  Our waitress made sure to ask us if everything tasted okay a few minutes after dropping off our plates, and was right on time with the check once we finished. My short and sweet visit to this 5 and Diner was one of the most seamless experiences I had in Arizona. :)",

I'm pretty simple, so I admit I have ordered the same exact item each time. The pancake with the chorizo on the side. I'm not absolutely certain what the meal was called but I know it has Southwestern in the name.  So the meal comes with the one HUGE pancake and a heaping order of chorizo. The portions are pretty big so you are able to share. The drinks are fairly small though. The prices aren't bad either. I believe we paid less than $25 for two full breakfasts with drinks.  The decor is pretty funky. It just like an old school diner. Each table has its own small jukebox. The establishment is pretty clean as well. The staff is also the nicest group of folks I have come across at a restaurant.   I'll definitely be making another trip here with the family soon = )",

The chicken pot pie is outstanding, as are the milkshakes, burgers, and sweet potato fries with chipotle mayo. You can't go wrong with a bacon cheeseburger or the teriyaki chicken sandwich with pineapple. Their breakfast is incredible (try the House Scramble/House Plate), the French toast, waffles, or anything else remotely related to breakfast. We love the location (cramped but fun) and always bring out-of-town guests here for an entertaining meal. You've gotta love the jukebox (retro, bright, and beautiful) and the 50s music.

    "text": "Found this little gem a few years ago when I moved. I read all of the reviews some great some not so great... decided to ignore the haters and whiners   and  give it a try. BEST DECISION EVER! Wandered in around 10:30 pm (moving sucks) and had to wait a few mins... place was packed! As I was waiting for a table I noticed the food coming out of the cooks window--- WOWIE. Mile high burgers, fluffy pancakes, and those shakes.. those shakes... YUM.   Was seated and immediately ordered a chocolate,  peanut butter, malted shake..  Let me start by asking \" do you know how hard it is to find malted anything in Diners anymore?\" this place did not disappoint. My shake was big, rich, and oh so good. I ordered their bleau burger and fries... again I was impressed. Burger was moist and delicious with just the right amount of Bleau cheese... the fries were shoe string fries and they were hot and crispy.  I know a lot of people have given this place a bad review but i'd advise you to take them with a grain of salt. 5 and Diner has recently been training new people to deal with the waves of people now coming because a fire broke out and damaged the other 5 and Diner in Scottsdale.  So give them a break. A diner experience shouldn't be rushed anyhow... slow down... relax... enjoy!",

Smh  I've been in Phoenix for almost 3 years. I've tried t 4 times in the time I've been here simply because I can literally walk to the place from my condo. The food is sooo bland it's so weird!   The first time I tried French toast, potatoes and eggs... Bland!  Second time ... Strawberry waffle, eggs... It took forever and the waffle just taste like dough, almost a little sour. I like my waffles a little in the fruity side.  Third time ..,, steak omelette. That was pretty good actually!! Very flavorful but the hash browns I ordered with it .... Bland bland bland!",

I understand that its busy but some waters and a quick \"hi guys, i will be right with you\" isnt that hard.  I think that it may be that we (my friend and i) were not wanted there?   We left after half an hour of being ignored and I could clearly see through the window our server zoom right to our table and rearrange the menus, etc.  If they didnt want us there, they should have said so in the first place when we first walked in.  We apologize for being the only yellow people there, we wont be making that mistake again.  Hah.",

I gave it a another chance again since the last time I came I ordered my usual BYO Skillet, it came with two hairs from two different people. I didn't complain or want to embarrass the crew so I just paid and left. Tonight after only ordering shakes for past times after that, I ordered the BYO skillet again. It was too spicy!!! I order it with my usual sausage , peppers & bacon. It's never spicy but for some reason today it was super spicy!! I only took about four bites I didn't even bother touching the eggs. I couldn't figure out if it was the sausage or peppers. It felt like they were jalapenos. I don't know, I just ate my toast. I was starving. The waitress noticed I wasn't eating, and everyone else was devouring their food. asked if I wanted a box. I said no and she took away my dish and charged me. I really shouldn't have paid $12 for what I just ate was toast and a water. That's the last time. Over price food. For shitty service each time.   Btw the booths and silverware are always dirty. Be caution.",

If you can, ask for Nitzul or Ashlee to be your waitress!  They are both totally awesome people and will make your time there so much fun.  For food, I personally recommend the Hungry Diner, Love Me Tenders, and the Tuna Melt!  They also have the best fried pickles in the world!

I'm a server myself and if I worked alongside her, I would've told her the job is not for her and to just quit. In earshot of us, she openly complained about not receiving a gratuity tip from a recent table. (Not surprised).   Most of our time in this restaurant was just above unpleasant. We were all shivering cold for most of our meal and the waitress didn't have a second thought about it. To our surprise her co worker John noticed immediately and turned down the A/C for us rather than our server caring about it.   I know I shouldn't expect much of a burger from a 24hr diner but the outside of my burger just tasted like straight burnt meat. The inside was cooked fine but the outside taste was horrid.   I tried to finish what I could with my meal and was wishing to order a dessert along with my company. After our server finally appeared after so long, my company seated closest to her was able to fit in a second to ask for a shake. After taking the order for the shake, I kid you not, she immediately turned around to go make the shake rather than to spend anymore time at the table to take any other dessert orders or take any requests. I had to wait until the shake was fully made and she had returned to order my dessert.  Yes, I should have just closed out my ticket right then and there but midnight dessert was why we were even there. Ordered my dessert and finished. My company and I paid our tickets and left mediocre tips. Am not interested in  going back soon.",

We had friend pickles as an appetizer and they were pretty decent could definitely use a little less salt.

    "text": "Our family has always loved 5 & Diner. Unfortunately, the PV Mall location closed recently, replaced by a Starbucks! Aargh! Fortunately, the 16th Street location, the original 5 & Diner, is still serving up a solid assortment of comfort food. The 1950's theme of the restaurant, reproduced though it is, seems genuine enough. Fun. Friendly servers. You can see why it's a favorite photo op for politicians and the like.   5 & Diner is open 24 hours a day, functioning equally well as a late night hangout, a morning coffee spot for retirees or as a place to take children for ice cream and pancakes. Coin operated jukeboxes located in many booths actually work! Selecting songs and waiting for them to play is great entertainment for kids. They also provide kids with paper hats and crayons. Or, if you're eating outdoors on the patio, hula hoops! The patio is also dog friendly.    Shake and sundae offerings are classic and delicious. They are best enjoyed sitting inside at the counter in my opinion. Breakfast offerings are served 24 hours a day. You're not going to see menu items at 5 & Diner being written up in food magazines for creativity and innovation, but they are American comfort food consistently well prepared.     5 & Diner is really all about the ambiance, 1950's style. Bring the kids, or bring the dog, or bring the kids and the dog, or bring your friends in need of a late night sobering up, and enjoy yourself.",

PLEASE, just quickly scrape out beef and replace with fish, another 15 minutes goes by and monstrosity arrives. Clearly they re-did the muffin and fish, but same (now cold) hash browns, hollandaise (topped with a bit of new), same eggs (also cold). Complain, manager (hispanic lady) says, 'sorry, we tried'. I say the plate is an embarrasment, if you were going to take 15 minutes, you could have at least re-made whole plate. She insists they did, I ask how they managed to cut her hard eggs just like she did, layer new holly over old stuff, she insists they remade it.  Restaurants screw up. Turns out waitress entered wrong model of benny, despite pleading with her to be careful. The mistake is sloppily fixed, but takes 15 minutes and they can't bother to replace 75 cents worth of hash browns and eggs.   Complain to the manager, all you get is a defiant 'sorry, we tried', and absolute BS they \"remade it all\". No discount, no nothing. They did correct the price of the wrong dish choice. Big deal.  5 and Diner is a diner, I don't expect 5 stars. But I don't like being lied to, particularly when the evidence is so obvious.

The dip that came with it was great too.  Our waiter was very quirky, which made our experience interesting in a good way. I ordered their sloppy joe meal that was their special of the day. I must admit that it was a good quality sloppy joe, even if that seems like an oxymoron. Afterwards I had apple pie a la mode that was good and flaky.

We went in ,ordered and food was delivered promptly,  and our waitress was kind and courteous (thank you waitress with pink hair). We paid leaving her a decent tip and walked out side. We both smoke and were very very full so we were walking and talking around the outer area of the parking lot so our smoke bothered no one. Then in the back of the restaurant (possibly an employee break area)a lady yelled rudely \" CAN I HELP YOU  \" she was smoking as well. We replied \"we were just having a cigarette after eating \"then she turned and  walked off. I'm sorry but when your assuming something and wrong, at least apologize . We certainly did nothing wrong,we weren't even by vehicles, and making sure our smoked cigarette butts were out and placed in the garbage. Not visiting here anytime soon.",

    "text": "Not only was the food mediocre, but the staff was slow, unknowledgeable and incompetent (although very nice, so sorry about that guys).  First of all, I have celiac or in lamens terms, I can't eat anything with gluten (wheat, oats, rye, barley) in it. So here I am at this kinda cute (kinda dumpy) diner with my boyfriend and I ask to see the allergen menu. So they come out with a packet with like 8 point font after a about a long wait, lovely. Then, our server takes about 15 minutes to ask us what we want...I ordered my meal, and substituded mashed potatoes for a side in order to keep gluten free. Just to be sure however, I asked our server if the potatoes are freshly made, she said YES.  Well, I eat one bite of mashed potatoes and minutes later I am sick. So I went to the front to ask somebody, and three of the staff members sit there and argue about wether or not the potatoes are fresh and the kitchen is literally RIGHT BEHIND THEM! Hello, just turn around and ask!  Finally, as I'm about to puke (sorry if that's TMI) one of them says \"there's our manager go ask her.\" Uh, rude. So I do and she informs me that they are in fact not freshly made, they come in a package and probably do contain wheat contrary to the gluten free menu. So of course, my boyfriend and I pack up our food really quick, I tell her they basically just poisoned me and her response was to pay at the front. Awesome. Needless to say I will not be going back there ever again.  What can I say that's positive about this place...(honeslty I'm not typically a negative person!) Well, they do look 50's, I'm sure it would be great place to take kids, and although I have a bad taste in my mouth about them not giving a crap that I just ate something I'm basically allergic to, they are friendly. So there, hope you enjoyed a small ray of sunlight in this negative review...",

(shes a very picky eater) the B&G would have tasted better to me if they didn't put paprika over if...   I had their Hound Dog... a pretty nice sized hot dog, the bun toasted... and you could add on chili, cheese or sour kraut!!! I had extra sour kraut and mustard on it! :) mmmm hit the spot... and their Fri's are sooo yummy!! and their BBQ sauce is super good too :)   we both decided to have a slice of their cheesecake.... I had strawberry topping.. it was alright.. i wish they had had cherry toppings... mmm.. but this cheesecake was amazing!!!!!!!!! so creamy and a really nice sized piece ... i cannot wait to have it again!! :)   Barbie Doll was very attentive and helpful... no where near annoying... at all!! i loved it... and all the other waiters that passed by were lovely as well.. all smiles.. but not the fake kinds... i liked it..",

    "text": "What I take is an Arizona-based 50's-theme diner chain, the 16th St. location of 5 & Diner is bright & super clean, with the jukebox standards playing in the background. The service was friendly and attentive, with a fresh glass of lemonade each time my mine was 2/3 empty.   The downer was the food. My turkey club was standard, but the fries tasted funny. Couldn't tell if it was the oil or the potatoes or a combination of both. The fact that they were lukewarm didn't help in the matter.   Due to lactose issues I didn't try any of the shakes, which I'm assuming is their real specialty. Every other table had atleast a few - I heard someone order the Butterfinger which, obviously, is a shake blended with the candy bar.   All said & done, a decent place. I'd try it again, but maybe by ordering something else. This particular location's open 24 hours, which I'm assuming the post-bar crowd heads to at 2 am on weekends. I myself ended up here after everything else in the neighborhood (besides Denny's) had already shut down for the night.",

    "text": "I've been going to 5 & Diners for about 15 years and especially this location. I have seen the quality go down as the prices go up. On this particular visit, I was appalled to see that a burger is now just shy of ten dollars. So I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, pretty basic, no special instructions. I ordered it medium. When I got it, it was half cooked. One half of the patty was cooked and the other half was pink on the inside. I am not sure how that happens. I was with my brother and we both got burgers. I stopped eating mine after I saw that the patty was cooked in that odd fashion. My brother's was prepared fine, but he also stopped eating his because it was just didn't taste good. Service was slow. Even though they were fully staffed and they weren't busy, it was still painfully slow.   There was puke in the sink in the women's bathroom. I spied this on the way to the men's bathroom as the women's bathroom door was open and an employee was attempting to clean it up. Unfortunately, I saw this before I got my food so that set my appetite into a spiral downwards. As for the men's bathroom, the urinal was broken and leaking water. Their solution for this problem was to put a Tupperware container under the leak. It was perched precariously on top of the urinal and was about half full of toilet water. Looking about ready to fall right on the customer who was using the urinal at that time.   This is the second time I have posted this review up. This is a legitimate account of my experience at this place and a warning that the food is very mediocre and the prices are getting crazy. For some reason it was taken down even though I plainly told my experience.",

    "text": "So me and my husband came in last night, it was pretty busy. It was pretty much the only thing open at 10 pm other than fast food, so we decided WTH why not. I had first ate here about maybe 3-4 years ago ? It was suuper good, so I was excited telling my husband this place is delishh!  We got seated, I ordered the Southwest Chicken Sandwich and he ordered the Philly Cheese Steak. It took over 30 mins to get our food. Which we didn't mind that much (mind you we are starving !!! ), the music jukebox kept us pretty entertained and the awesome decor.   CONS: The food was horrible! The menu states 'nothing is refrigerated and everything is fresh', which I for sure don't believe. The chicken looked fake as hell, almost like the big pieces of fish they give you at Pete's Fish & Chips. Or the frozen cheap versions you can buy at Wal Mart. Ugh, it was so disgusting, just the thought of it makes me nauseous.  IDK if they have new ownership, but the first time I came and ate there, I got the same thing and it was so so good I had to order it again. I wouldn't have came back if it was that bad.  The Philly CS was pretty gross too. It tasted like cardboard.  I mean for 28-30$ you would expect you are going to eat some great a** food. NOPE not that case at all ! I was so bummed, we would of been better off going to Jacks or Wendys.   PROS: Customer Service. Which is everything to me, other than what you are paying for. Everybody was extremely and genuinely nice. That is the ONLY reason I give 2 stars, because of the wait staff. Sucks but I wont be coming back here :(",

So I'm no longer going to be frequenting this establishment as the food sucks along with most of the service !!!! .........Update, It's been a year and we decided to give this place another try because it's right here in our neighborhood,....after waiting over 35 minutes with no apologies we still didn't have our food and the people around us that were  there before us also didn't have their food, we quickly realized it was going to be over 45 minutes minimum to see our food so we dropped 5 dollars on the table and moved on our way to another local business where our food was on the table at 10 minutes and they were way more busy than this place ever will be needles to say I will not be returning here ever I've been screwed over too many times and I'm actually done with this location as it will more than likely be closed within another year !!!!",

But honestly, my threshold for being pleasantly surprised here is when the food is just okay.  I'm really glad the last time I ordered a burger that I said medium-rare, because when it came out like an hour later, it was charred black on the outside and completely gray inside.  If I'd ordered it medium, it'd probably have been a pile of ashes and a bun.  I didn't bother sending it back because it would have taken a million more years.  I just ate half and threw the rest away.  There wasn't enough ketchup in the world to raise that from the dead.  I don't know what people see in this place.",

When I spoke to the manager she said she would have to tell the cooperate chef??  She offered to make me another one but I was not interested.  I told her that I felt like we had been short changed on it and she just said she was sorry.  The senior menu had it with ham for $5.99 - I told the waiter that I just wanted the regular grilled cheese and he said ok.  On the bill it was $6.99!!! for two pieces of bread and 2 small pieces of cheese! ... We will not return!!",

A week ago I have been greeted by this young gentleman and I asked him to sit outside but he refused and claimed the patio is \"closed\". And I believed him and sat inside.  Yesterday Nov 5th I went there and was greeted by the same waitress and asked him to sit outside @ 6-7pm and he said no please sit inside. I said \"I want to sit outside\" and then he said \"no I prefer if you sit inside.\" I said \"ha?\" he said \"prefer if you sit inside.\"    I did not want to argue with him because I went their to enjoy my time and the food so I just went and sat inside.   This way of treating customers is not acceptable let alone me being a regular and he was my server for 3+ times and he knows me well.  Good luck in your attitude and congratulations for losing a regular. Too sad.",

I had the breakfast skillet and it was filling and good, while hubby had the meatloaf dinner. They even have an outdoor dog friendly patio which I know Ralphie will appreciate when we go again. Skip on over to enjoy that cup of coffee or milkshake while listening to that 50's music!",

I have not had a bad meal here; breakfasts 24 hours are great, specials and dinners always hit the spot. The Reubens are great, meatloaf and chicken dishes. Even the Cobb salad was good. The staff is always very cheerful, friendly and most helpful. I did research on 5 and Diner and note, 5 and Diner is now owned by a former franchisee in Massachusetts who bought out everything, LPM Holding Co. The owners have over 35 years in the restaurant and other businesses so it can only improve. There are 5 and Diners in 9 states now.",

Omelettes, waffles, toast, and pancakes are all present and tasty.  And lastly, it is a pretty darn good lunch and dinner joint. I'm a big fan of the Surf City sandwich but the Teriyaki Pineapple Burger has lately become my numero uno.    Phoenix would not be the same without Five and Diner.",

Don't bother checking in with the host to be seated as I saw many people just seat themselves although there was a 20 min wait for others, the staff rude, uncaring & could possibly be where all the servers go that can't get a job in any other Resteraunt. A complete disgrace & I would never give such a place my hard earned money, I suggest you do the same.",

The service was pretty fast and friendly and the atmosphere is so cute and feels like you're back in the 1950's. That I enjoyed! My family got omelettes, biscuits, chicken fried steak, and burgers and fries. They all liked their food. I got the veggie omelette, and it was good but not a whole lot of flavor. It came with wheat toast that was buttered to the point of being soggy; I will remember to ask for it dry next time, and a side of ham. The prices were okay. If you look gut busting delicious food with a 50's diner feel, this place is for you! I will come here again.",

Waited more than 30 minutes for our food, then my salad came out WITH our dinners.  Chicken friend steak ok, but smothered in bad gravy...mashed potatoes might have been okay, but also ruined with a lot of BAD gravy.  The corn was crunchy-mushy.  I chose the fish & chips, which I feel should only be advertised with big window paint, if it's edible, I literally couldn't eat it...but the fries weren't bad.  The waitress said sorry for the wait, only one cook & he was slammed, but we were terribly disappointed.  I can't believe this place is still open, with so many good resturants holding on & stil more, popping up.",

It's great for that and for chilling to the oldies.  I can't say I ever had any idea that the place would still be going strong, as I remember it was originally only a temporary setup, awaiting the inevitable displacement from the planned freeway down Colter (which never ended up materializing).  Imagine my shock when I drove past one in Las Vegas a few years ago.  Long live the 5 & Diner.",

So, we hopped in the car and drove the 15 miles or so down to the Diner.  Glanced at the menu, but didn't need much time. The menu has all the staples from back in the day when we were regulars at 2am after work. Ordered wet fries, malt, cherry/vanilla coke, Blue Moon Burger & French Dip.  Tossed a quarter in the jukebox at the table, then found out the wheel to flip thru the pages was stuck. Moved to a different table, tossed a quarter in as the flipper worked, played 2 songs only to figure out that the volume switch on this one didn't work. Back to Table 1. Waitress came by and informed us that the table jukes aren't always reliable (if at all) and to use the main juke for best results. I told her she should call \"the guy\" and seems it had never occurred to the staff that there must be a guy that works on this kinda stuff...  Anyway, juke fiasco aside - the food was good. Wet fries and fountain drinks is why we were really there. No complaints on either. You can check it out 24hrs a day, so whenever is convenient for you; stop in!  Upon leaving, I noticed they have a shiny food truck parked in the lot - not sure where you can find this around town, but keep your eyes open for it!",

Now don't get me wrong, I don't mind a bug or two - I buy organic when I can and they just are part of the deal (no pesticide use).    But still, you need to wash the lettuce before you serve - just common sense here folks.  Couple this with the overcooked meat - stereotypical fries - and you have the perfect recipe for me to avoid!     Can't recommend.

You are not coming to this place for amazing food, you come for the atmosphere and IMO, it falls short on delivering that. The staff have setting attire, but they don't act like it, they're just here for the pay check, and maybe that's too much to ask but this really is all about the experience.   Probably not worth traveling specifically to visit this place. Do stop by if you're getting your car fixed at the local Toyota dealer though and want to eat somewhere a little different.",

Our waitress was friendly and service was good but for the quality & price of the food we definitely wont be returning anytime soon. Sad because this is a Phoenix institution but if the food is no good there is really no point of spending my money there.",

    "text": "Lucky for me this place was right across the street from the hotel I stayed at. I missed their so called breakfast that closed at 0930 so was a bit hungry when I checked out at 1100.   As it was just me I sat at the counter. They were very busy, people waiting for seating. It took a few minutes to get waited on but it was understandable in the situation. I ordered an Urban Eggs Benedict ($11.99) with country fried potatoes. When it arrived it had two poached eggs (that were more on the hard side than soft- but no biggie) served on English muffins with ham and hollandaise sauce. Also a very large portion of the potatoes. It was good, I cleaned my plate off! So, good food, decent price.  However, when I returned home to Wisconsin and reviewed my charge card bill there was a problem. Namely: a $13.02 bill plus $2 tip ($15.02 total- I kept copy of receipt)  has morphed into a $23.02 bill on the monthly cc statement!  I called on 3-20-19 and was told manager was expected in next day around 10am. I called 3-21-19 and spoke to a woman who said she was the manager. She took the info from my receipt and said the general manager would call me the next day. Two days later I've yet to be contacted. Lesson: If \"JenniferT\" takes your credit card beware because it appears she likes to change the tip. She added a $10.00 tip to my $13.02 bill when I intended $2. Keep your receipts( old school).",

Not my favorite food I've eaten but it was fun to go and have dinner for a night out with friends. As for the decor, it was amazing. Older songs you can choose from for a quarter and a great overall feel!",

We were their for an hour (from 1:45-2:45am) which was kind of long, but the retro music and the environment made up for the slow service (although the food did come out decently fast!). I had the Turkey Club (w/ chipotle mayo) and a side of coleslaw and which was pretty good! I tried my friends pancakes, topped with blueberries, they were good; although, it's unfortunate they don't have fruit syrups (like blueberry syrup). I will be back, to see if my second experience is any better.",

That being said it's well worth the short wait.  This is just basic mom and pop diner food with a 50s theme.  We have never gotten anything bad here and the Reuben is outstanding. All of their classic breakfast fare is wonderful and served 24/7.  The staff is friendly helpful and work together to keep your drinks filled and your food delivered.  They also have limited patio seating if you choose to eat outside.  This is our go-to restaurant when we've been out running around and just want to grab something and not have to cook when we get home.  Ask them about their rewards card it'll earn you 10% back on your purchases it's not well known but it's there at the bottom of the menu.",

    "text": "Horrible experience!  I'm not sure where the 5 star reviews come from...came here for late night food. There was 4 of us total. To start off there was 2 place settings for 4 people. So after ordering our food we asked for another 2 place settings and the waitress \"Malaysia V\" literally walked away and came back with sour cream that looked like someone licked the top off of it with there tongue.  Then when she placed it down in front of us she says \"that's what you asked for right???!\" With an attitude. No...actually we asked for 2 place settings, she laughed, walked away and came back. No guacamole or meat on what they call nachos (no tortilla chips, just French fries with cheese and jalapenos) Gross! My husband handed her a small plate that was full of old crusty food and asked for a new one for the appetizer we ordered. She again laughed, walked away came back with a clean plate this time. My pregnant friend ordered a waffle with strawberries and powdered sugar, no whip cream and syrup on the side. Her COLD waffle came with whip, powdered sugar, old funky smelling strawberries that seemed to be expired or just flat out rotten, and no syrup. She asked waitress for syrup twice, finally received it and started eating. She took about 3 bites and made me try it. The strawberries tasted rotten and the waffle was cold. My husbands chicken salad was full of iceberg rotten lettuce, and just fried chicken. No bacon or anything else that was supposed to come on it. He didn't complain because he's not that type of person. My pregnant friend on the other hand gave her plate to the waitress Malaysia and said \"I'm sorry but I can't eat this\". The waitress grabbed the plate and said in a sarcastic tone \"don't worry I'll take it off the bill\" and walked away. Didn't offer her anything else or to give her another menu to pick a different meal. I winded up sharing my turkey club and French fries with her instead because she was hungry. The pickles had mold on them (see picture attached) Never asked us once if any of us needed or wanted refills. The Philly cheesesteak was a joke. This place has completely fell off. The health department should be aware of there food and the cleanliness as well. Also, I don't believe waitresses with 2 inch fake nails should be serving food. She practically had her nails almost in the food when putting it down on our table. Definitely won't be back! We were all pretty disgusted. Would've been better off at Denny's or ihop. Go elsewhere!",

It's cozy, and the jukebox is the cherry on top of the (very rich and highly caloric) milkshake. Almost feels like if Jackrabbit Slim's from Pulp Fiction were a real franchise. The fried pickles were soggy greasy perfection, and the blueberry pancakes were outstanding. Best bleu cheese burger I have had in PHX as well. You also simply MUST try the bread pudding--it is memorable to say the least. I was in a sugar coma for the next day, one of my arteries is probably now clogged and I might have to go for bypass surgery, but I have NO regrets! This place is worth shaving ten years off your lifespan--and it's open 24 hours! It blows IHOP out of the water. A definite standout if you are looking for the True 50's diner experience.",

My food did taste really good, the \"hungry diner\", just a little greasy.  The worst part though, as I finished eating my meal, I look over and crawling across my part of the booth is a nice size COCKROACH!! EWH, It crawled right towards me. The server came back right in time when is happened. She somehow thought I was lying until I freak out of the booth and she looked a little closer. Under her breath she then apologized and said she'll take care of it. I barley knew what she said but before I knew it my date was headed to the door.  I will never go back there!

If I'd had more time and could've found my server, I would've had the food re cooked. Never should've gotten to my table this way. Ended up with the trots from the food today. Won't be back. Lenny would be embarrassed.",

It doesn't matter what time of day I stop in...middle of a weekday, after midnight on a weekend...the place is friendly and busy. There is another closer to my house, but this location wins my heart every time. Another bonus? Their table side jukeboxes actually work.   Our most recent visit  was for post-fireworks dessert. We finally tried the new menu. The Waffle Wonder was a hit. Half a waffle (by the way this location's waffles are superior to all others) covered in cinnamon sugar, vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup, and caramel. It tasted like a supercharged churro. So yummy. My friend got the Diner Split which might seem run-of-the-mill, but it had a large scoop each of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry ice cream, with all the requisite sauces plus a deep fried banana. Yep, you heard right, deep-fried freakin' banana. I had a chocolate malted and could not have been happier.  Next time you need a great way to cap off a late downtown night, check this place out.",

    "text": "The Groovy P. and I ventured to his old stomping grounds for lunch today.  The '5 and Diner' on 16th St and Colter left me with little to ask for.  Before coming here I had a preconceived notion that 5 & Diners were dirty and nasty. Not the case at all.  We walk in and let the waitress know we want to sit outside (since it's so nice and they had misters).  We get two different servers bringing us stuff (talk about service) and I ask the one waitress for recommendations.  I didn't listen to her, of course, and ordered the Southwestern Burger w/ coleslaw and started with a nice stack of rings.  The Onion Rings were perfectly cooked.  They looked like they were prepackaged, but they were very crispy and I could actually bite through the onion without pulling the entire thing out (don't you hate that?!!!)  The Southwestern Burger was order Medium Rare and was cooked accordingly.  Soft, juicy, and pink with a nice crispy browned outer layer that can only be achieved on a well used grill.  The creaminess of the chipotle mayo paired beautifully with the green chiles.  Unfortunately, because I ate too many onion rings, I couldn't finish my burger.  What a shame!  The Coleslaw was just how I like it.  It's hard to find a really good coleslaw.  I prefer mine to be slightly sweet, not sour.  Too much vinegar in slaw ruins it in my opinion.  This slaw had the perfect marriage of mayo, vinegar, and sugar. Not to mention carrots...  My experience here was great!  The servers were top notch and kept my water full the entire time and actually chatted with us for a few minutes.  There is an artist guy named Ross who has been there every day for 5393 days straight. No, not an employee.  He goes there and does his art! He hasn't missed a SINGLE day!!! That's like... 15 years! So if you wanna seem to be 'in the know' ask where Ross is... They'll be able to tell you.  Time for a nap!",

I had an albacore tuna melt with fries and a lemonade, and my wife had a burger with onion rings and a cherry coke.  The food was very good, hot, and served quickly.  Our waiter was prompt & friendly.    Cute 50's atmosphere, but it interested me how many security cameras are mounted throughout the place.  It's not a large joint, but there are 4 or 5 video cameras in there for some reason.    My only complaint is the pricing. I was expecting a burger in a \"5 & Diner\" to be $5 or $6.  It was $9.  This is greasy comfort food -- and good greasy comfort food at that -- but that's just too pricey for greasy comfort food, especially in this type of setting.  I would have given this place 4 stars if we hadn't ended up spending over $40 for lunch for 2 (2 sandwiches with fries/rings, 2 drinks + a milkshake to go for my wife).  This lunch was worth $25.

    "text": "*Businesses do have bad days, I'm very aware of that* experienced Saturday Morning 9/22/12 approx 11a  I already felt weird meeting my date at a 50s diner, being black, because back then blks/whts didn't even sit together, but I quickly got over that LOL  The design of the restaurant is pretty neat, a pink trailer. & inside, the booths are pretty retro. The menu is more extensive than one might think. I was overwhelmed by the choices.  I went with lunch during breakfast time. Ordered a chicken fried chicken w/mashed potatoes and a bowl of fruit.  I ordered apple juice, at first they told me the machine was broken so I took cranberry juice as a substitute but before I could drink that, they brought me the apple juice and swiftly took the cranberry away. This was odd to me because if the cranberry juice is already poured, and I've put my straw in it, are you just taking it and throwing it down the sink? & if you're doing that, you should just leave it for me, but whatever I was happy they had the apple juice.  The waitresses that I encountered were nice enough. I was glad they had some color in the establishment, just makes me feel more comfortable (hispanic-descent waitress).  My order came, just as I ordered it and it looked good. I always start with my fruit, as I'm eating it and enjoying it, I get to a cantaloupe piece and WHOOMP! There It Is!! There's a dead fly in my fruit cup. I showed my date and he swiftly decided we were leaving. By this time, we'd both enjoyed some sips of our drinks and our food had just been delivered and he was waiting on some butter for his pancakes. I was a little reluctant to leave because I was just so hungry.  But you can't give business to an establishment when there is a bug on your plate.  We showed the waitress who apologized and discarded my plate, however when they noticed we were leaving, they said have a great day! I mean, I don't know what else they could've said. It's not like we would've accepted a voucher to return or something because we wouldn't. But it's not the waitresses' fault, whoever prepared the fruit should've rinsed it, problem averted. I'm sure it's a nice place, however I had a bad experience so it's doomsday. They won't lose sleep over it, I wouldn't have been a regular anyway",

    "text": "A heaping scoop of cold mashed potatoes slathered with LAME sauce is how I would classify this dinner!  I've read some of the other reviews on this particular establishment, and will agree with the one that says that businesses sometimes have bad days.  It would appear that this business is having more than their fair share these days.  There were 5 of us, including one fairly easy to please 10 year old.  First it took the server the better part of a half an hour to acknowledge that we were sitting on the patio in high 80 degree weather with no beverages.... IN THE DESERT!!!  C'mon.  Once we ordered I just assumed that everything would remedy itself.  It was only the beginning.  When the food was delivered (along with the appetizer that we ordered) it was cold and not even close to what we ordered.  Picture it... a \"hot\" roast beef open faced sandwich, which I asked for a substitution of french fries for the mashed potatoes (not a major request) and the bread was cold and soggy because it sat in the window forever.  When I asked to have it made to it's menu specifications AKA HOT, they took it back and threw it in the microwave and returned the plate to me as I sent it back to the kitchen.  How do I know that?  Well, you know what happens when you put bread in the microwave?  It's gets hard and stale, a texture that once you experience you won't soon forget.  When we told the waitress that \"tonight isn't a good night for us here I guess\".  Her response was \"It is for me too\".  Server Rule #1 - NEVER MAKE YOUR PROBLEM, THEIR PROBLEM!  Enter the \"Manager\".  I do have to give points for the manager standing in front of us and taking her lumps.  I have to take away points for never making an offer to take anything off the bill.  You have to remember that I sent my food back and declined an offer for anything else.  If any of the restaurant staff reads this review, please take one thing away from it... You can work wonders by L-I-S-T-E-N-I-N-G and NOT MAKING EXCUSES!!  If the kitchen truly was the problem, they needed to step it up!!  If the waitress couldn't handle the number of people she was waiting on, you should have replaced her or reduced her section.  I only say this because we noted that she was waiting on a huge party of 15 people, us and several others (and I don't think she was experienced enough to even handle two tables).  Ready for dessert?  One of the waitresses was wearing a cute black skirt uniform dress.  Apparently she was having issues with her shoes or socks because she bent over to readjust them.  I bet you know what's coming next.... What's rule #1 when wearing a skirt ladies??  Don't bend over in your skirt when your standing three steps above the people below you, because they will surely see whatch-yo Mama gave ya!!  In closing, do I think this was meant to be four star dining? NO.  Do I think that we deserved as much attention as anyone else there tonight? ABSOLUTELY.  Did we catch them on a bad night?  PROBABLY.  Will I go back and give them a second and final opportunity to improve upon this bad experience?  YOU BETCHYA!!  Good luck here, and I hope your experience is better than ours was.",

The food is very good albeit a tad salty.  I love the tripledecker BLT, fries and a big ol' Vanilla Coke.  It is a delight.  The meatloaf is stick to the ribs and the hubby says the Reuben is good.  Salads are good and fresh.  Staff is good, fun without being  all Ed Debevic's over the top.  The servings are ample and very good.

We usually don't stand for long, until we get seated in a big table. The tables are always clean, So is the bathroom. I haven't been in a situation where I was angry with any of the staff.   There are many options to choose from the menu, and if I choose something, it comes in about 5 minutes or less. Their service is quick, and the waitress comes to our table as soon as we are seated. There are a lot of burgers to choose from, and many milkshakes. I always go with the BBQ burger because it as always good to have. I once ordered a burger, and I asked for it to be well done. When I started eating it, I realized it was not well done at all. It may have a mistake, but the waitress came right away, took my dish, and brought another well done burger with a new plate of fries. I always go back to this restaurant because I always get treated right, with great service.",

The decor is cute and kitschy, just like Al's on Happy Days. The music on the juke box, the booths, decor and even the waitresses uniforms all worked in concert making me feel I took a trip back in time.  I ordered pancakes with blueberry compote, sausage and eggs. Everything was cooked well, but the pancakes lacked flavor. The blueberry compote was clumped ontop of the stack, and ran off the plate as I attempted to eat. The restaurant was so cold that the butter hardly melted. After a few bites, the pancakes were too cold to enjoy if I wanted to finish them.  I was also put off by the a la carte pricing. I paid almost $20 for what should have been a breakfast special.",

There was seating outside but I was fine inside. I ordered a Texas burger I think it was called and let me tell you it was awesome. This burger came at the recommendation of \"Piper\" she said it was a great choice and being a lover of onion rings I quickly agreed. Speaking of Piper she was awesome never had an empty glass and was super attentive if we needed anything. When the food arrived, the burger was juicy the onion rings crispy and big. One of the better burgers I have had. Pricing was very fair especially for the amount of food and service I got. Next time I'll be trying the country fried steak and a shake!   Would def recommend this place to anyone!",

We (my fiance and I) ordered one cheeseburger and fries to share. That's it- one order. And it took around/over? 30 minutes to arrive.  The cheeseburger was pretty good, but the fries were nothing special. And just the cheeseburger and fries cost $13!! That's overpriced to me. Maybe you're paying for the 50s atmosphere, but I'd rather go to In-N-Out.  BOTTOMLINE: we probably won't return. But if you like 50s diner/Retro themed restaurants, you might enjoy this place.",

I got the BYO skillet with mushrooms, onion, and turkey sausage, and it a little underseasoned, but that's why there's salt and pepper on the side! Their onion rings are breaded and deeeelicious. I also really enjoyed the biscuit. All in all, a charming place with decent breakfast foods.   I will also add that their milkshakes look AMAZING. Next time, l'll be sure to try one.",

I still go to the mall, but I'm blowing money on Macy's and Dillard's instead of Sears and Foot Locker.  I still shoot vodka like I'm in undergrad, I just make sure it's top shelf only.   And I still show up drunk to diners in the middle of the night, I will just make a habit of 5 & Diner instead of those *other* chains.   OK, there's literally no way to spin liking 5 & Diner of all places as a quantifiable improvement in personal growth. I am self aware enough to know I am trashy and an absolute tool just for trying. But I *do* know it's a cut above whatever else you were planning to get after you were done partying. Heck, I could actually eat here for lunch and probably be OK with it. I'm craving another BLT with fries already!",

So, this could mean one of two things 1- their potatoes were shipped refrigerated or 2- they were leftovers!  Yuck!!!  The only reason they got 3 stars is because the staff was nice. Won't go back.",

Everyone was constantly on the move.  Food was served quickly! We ordered the Cali omelet and the French toast. Both were flavorful and completely devoured! It's cute, kitschy, and your typical 50's diner. However their tabletop juke box selection is more extensive than I've seen anywhere else. I'd love to come back again sometime for that middle-of-the-night belly bomb! Stay tuned...",

    "text": "Overall a very adorable and nostalgic experience down the cherry red booths and checkered floors, brings you right back to the olden days. I've been twice now, both times later in the evenings, (around 10 or 11pm.) Both times the place has been hopping, I was lucky enough to get one of the final seats in the place before a waiting line was established.   First time I ordered breakfast, just your standard eggs, bacon, hash browns and a pancake. On the menu it's called the \"Hungry Diner.\" I asked for my hash towns extra crispy which they were, bacon was also the perfect blend of crispy and chewy, and they didn't skimp which was a plus. Overall way better than Denny's which has sadly been my go to for a lazy breakfast that I don't feel like cooking myself since I moved from Chicago...and away from my precious Delia's.   Second trip I decided to see if their dinner options were up to snuff, I ordered the open face roast beef with mashed potatoes. Roast beef was sliced thin and tender, gravy was a little gloppy and overly salty but it was still very homey, comfort food so I didn't mind all that much. My main complaint was the mashed potatoes, they tasted funny and I couldn't put my finger on what it was. Had the apple pie for dessert, filling was tart and delicious, crust was just ok.   Overall the service was fairly positive, they really seemed to be a little overwhelmed both times I went so you can't really fault them for not winning any attentive awards but my drinks were always kept full and I received my food in a timely manner so props for that.   Would definitely go back, and next time I'm eyeing the milkshakes!",

I know an excellent place close by that does a prociutto eggs Benedict perfectly for the same price and the place is a lot more upscale. The service was good I had a really sweet server named Piper. The sausage my daughter had was so awful I can't even describe it. How do you mess up sausage links? They are so oily and it tastes like old fryer oil. I'm pretty sure the only reason people come here is for the 1950's ambiance. I came here bc it's within walking distance and thought I'd give it a try. Next time I'll just cook at home.

I rarely see such productivity any more. Thumbs up to the kitchen staff; you guys rock it out!   SERVICE: Barely courteous. I think our server made eye contact once. The server was quick and attentive, which is probably more than you can expect, especially for a place like this. I will say this: The servers at this location take a lot of crap from the customers. I see and hear them too. In our server's defense we did arrive just as the Sunday church crowd was abating. I know how AWFUL the church crowd are. And I know they are usually terrible tippers.

    "text": "I love bringing my kids here but now I'm wondering if I can even take them there anymore since I was chewing on my French toast and bit into a staple. After feeling that electric jolt biting into a piece of metal with fillings in your molars, I spit out the bread and there was the staple. The food is great and never had any complaints, the service is pretty great too; however the manager on staff right now (June 16, 19) didn't want to take responsibility for the staple in my food. She kept blaming the bread company and the Uber eats delivery person (it was IN the bread so it's impossible for the courier to do it anyway) and then tried to say I made it all up and then hung up. So I'm disappointed because if I wasn't the kind of person who chewed their food, I'd be making an ER visit after swallowing a staple right now.  EDIT: The owner was gracious and responded to me privately with an apology and offered a meal on him. All I wanted was an apology and taking accountability and I got it. Thank you!",

I pass this place all the time and thought of it when I wanted pancakes after the gym LOL  Surprisingly it wasn't very busy for a Sunday morning. The atmosphere is really cool...literally an old 60's diner...super cute.  The menu is pretty basic, all the essentials but of course my husband wanted something not on the menu. Our waitress was great (not overly friendly) but shared that they can make us just about anything we want even if it's not on the menu.  This is a new favorite place.  I knocked off a star because the coffee isn't great but our food was sooooo good. Simple and delicious.",

They did have a turkey burger (or veggie burger) option which I did.   Do ask for low or no mayo, they put way too much on.   For some reason yelp says this place is good for groups: that's not True. We have a group of 6 and had to wait for a long time to get seated. Also the booth was extremely cramped. Also lots of [screaming] kids here.",

Also ordered the open face Chili Size burger and the Steak Bomblette.  The pot pie was absolutely wonderful, filled with potatoes, peas, celery and chicken.  Very creamy and a crusty crispy dough on top, important for me is it's not salty.  The Chili Size was decked with mountain of chili and beans.  Toasted buns and beef patties cooked to your doness.  Love the service, always attentive to our needs and making sure we liked our food.",

The fast pace of the diner would make you think they wouldn't go out of their way, but our server appeased our little one quickly and breakfast was on the table in no time.

Living in NE Phoenix, I tried Denny's only because they had a good one (until I found a roach under the sandwich on my plate).  Never again.  Then Coco's, but they closed.  Then the 5 & Diner near the Paradise Valley Mall, but they closed.  So I drive a bit to the original on 16th St. north of Camelback.  Despite always being crowded, I love the sandwich and fries.  The atmosphere is fun with its '50's music and the service is good.",

The food reminds me of stuff my mom use to make, this place is perfect if you are looking for all American home cooked type cuisine.   I love coming here, they are open 24 hours so weather it is lunch time, breakfast or dinner you can order what ever you want. Burgers for breakfast or Pancakes for dinner.  And the milkshakes here are to die for. Don't go to Sonic for a milkshake come here they can not be beat. The staff is always super friendly.   The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is the fact that it is a little grungy feeling. it's open 24 hours a day so I think they need to close and just give it a real deep clean...that and that the little Juke boxes on the tables never seem to be working properly.   But if you want good food with good service, this greasy spoon ain't so bad.",

He got the Big Bopper with onion rings and I got the New Yorker with fries.  I love their fries.  I think they know the secret of McDonald's' fries cause they tasted very similar.  Soft but crispy at the same time.  Love it!  We played some tunes, then ended our meal with Half Off Happy Hour Shakes (2pm to 4pm everyday for the summer).  I got a chocolate banana shake and he got a Reese's one.  They give you the rest of the shake in the mixer cup and that filled it up for another round.    We had fun singing and dancing to the oldies and enjoyed our entire meal.    Service was really good.  Our waitress was Tiny T and she was super nice and kept us happy.  The guy who brought our food was super funny and friendly.  And the manager we talked to was really nice.  Had a great time!",

I have two little boys who are 5 and 7 and they get so excited to go to 5 & Diner and put quarters in the miniature jukebox at the table and wear the paper 5 & Diner caps they get with their color-on menu and crayons.    I love the service and the ambience.  It's easy to imagine I'm transported back to the 1950's when my own parents were in high school and times seemed simpler...even though I doubt they were actually any simpler.  I remember coming to 5 & Diner in the wee hours of the night after my friends and I left the nightclubs back in the early 1990's.  We'd sit in the booth wearing our black leather jackets and fashionable club attire, and pound down cigarettes (you could still smoke in there then, but not now...THANK GOODNESS) and drink cup after cup of hot coffee while devouring plates of strawberry covered waffles and heaps of bacon.  (Those were the days.)    Anyway, I took the family last weekend and was surprised that they recently changed their menu and the dinner entree I was looking forward to ordering was gone.  (Major bummer.)   It looked like they changed the whole menu since my last visit and I'm still not sure I love the new menu, it'll take a couple of more visits before I have a verdict on that...I know for sure if they got rid of their eggs benedict I'll be scarred for life!  You need to go to 5 & Diner if you are into nostalgia, it's a wonderful place with great service that makes me wistful for a time that came and went a full 20 years before I was even born.    Now lets just see if the new menu sucks or not...",

I came in for dessert one night, not wanting to go back to my hotel room. I debated between a few options, but went with the Diner Split. The fried banana sold me. The split also had strawberries, chocolate, vanilla and strawberry ice creams, whipped cream, and was topped with a marachino cherry.   There was no way I could eat the whole thing (it would be great for 2 or 3 people to share). So I enjoyed as much as I could, making sure I got ALL of the banana.",

I guess whoever owned the land forced the diner out, tore the building down and built a brand new building housing 5 little businesses...  So, the 16th St 5 n Diner is ok...Ample parking. Severs and staff were pleasant...facility was clean but in need of some repairs.  The inside is small - seemed crowed to us compared to the Arrowhead diner and it was LOUD - ie had a high noise level.  Some of the booths had their vinyl booths taped together.  We were in and out within 45 minutes.    Food was ok...burgers were ordered medium well and were Crispy on the outside and decent on the inside.  Fries...seemed to be stale...I had a chocolate shake and it was good.  My wife says she wouldn't go out of her way, again, to visit this location.",

The music is great and the food is good no matter what your level of intoxication is. Now I'm not using that as a jab at all, that's part of the reason I love this place. Where else could you stuff down a greasy burger at 3 AM, gulp down a massive shake, listen to the wailing of Buddy Holly, have a waiter named McFly, and enjoy being trashed all at the same time? Sure it's not the cleanest nor does it have the best service, but who cares?  If you go at the right hour late at night you'll see people that you are convinced could not be out in sunlight. Be sure to look for the guy that looks like a hermit Santa outside with the wildlife scenes he hand painted on his van. Again, I'm not knocking this place because it's part of the experience.

This is one of the few places to eat on the patio where you are far enough away from the street.",

I also tried some of my dads waffle and it was the best. that's not all, my mom's biscut & gravy was definitely the best!!!!  And on top of that the waiter was very nice plus he gave us comment on my dad's rocky shirt and said \" this man still got it \" and he made sure we were happy by coming by when we were served asking us to have a malt but we were fine and we loved it anyways without a malt . I highly recommend this dinner to friends & family even the press",

The second time around I tried their Hot Wings traditional style with no sauce and they could compete for the worst wings I had in my life award but I gave them a break because it was 3am (even though they are open 24hrs), the wings were very small, over cooked, and just fried  plain then had seasoning salt threw over them. Anyway I gave this place another shot, but this time around I chose to stick with breakfast and ordered the Strawberry and Whipped Cream Pancakes while my date ordered Chicken Fried Steak with a side of Fresh Fruit. As my Pancakes arrived they just seemed as if they were not freshly made so it took a minute for me to dig into them and I wasn't really in the mood to complain so I just went with them. So in between time me and my date are conversing and she had already started in on her fruit bowl. Then she politely shows me this HUGE FLY resting in peace on here chunk of Honey-Dew Melon. NEVER AGAIN!!!",

    "text": "We had just finished an early morning hike up Piestewa Peak, and were driving around looking for someplace to eat.  Then we see this, shiny, silver, steel clad diner, like something that would not be out of place in a \"Happy Days\" rerun.   There were outdoor seating, and we intended to dine outside, but the misters (I think that is what its called) were so strong it was like sitting in a shower, so we headed inside.  Once inside it was like we traveled back in time to the 1950's, there were vinyl padded booths along the windows, and a counter that ran down the other side of the room.  The wait staff was also dressed to fit the period decor, with some of the women wearing poodle skirts.  We ordered the Mediterranean omelet, pecan waffles, and hot cakes.  All were delicious, but the hash browns that came with the omelet was so extra yummy.  (In fact I'm thinking of just ordering a big plate of hash browns is I am ever back in Phoenix)  The service was really helpful and friendly, offering suggestions about the menu; refilling drinks; bringing extra utensils, and condiments; and chatting with us.  Overall the experience was great, and I would highly recommend this place not only for the cool decor, but the awesome tasty food.  Oh yeah, and don't forget to order hash browns:)",

I just had dental work and have been eating like a senior citizen, so I opted for the mac n cheese. It was warm and gooey with a crunchy cheese topping- a great comfort food.

Ambiance won the 4th star - very retro diner.  Wait staff was oustanding also, careful to keep our sodas topped off and quick to get us what we needed.  And, yes, for a Sunday morning, the joint was beyond busy.  A little on the pricey side for a family of 5 plus 1 visitor; the $4 milkshakes didn't help with that at all.  We'd consider visiting again, if only because they're open 24 hours.",

If you can hit it before the after-bar crowd gets there, it's a much better scene. Anything minus loud drunk people being obnoxious is a plus in my opinion.  The 50s style is fun and fabulous in its own way (jukeboxes - sweet!), the staff and clientele are decidedly queer (which is good because so am I) and there's no lack of personality.  There seems to be one ornery waitress who has no problem telling folks where they can go, but perhaps that's her being \"in character\" ... or something.  Happily our favorite server \"Spinner\" usually scoops us up when we come in and takes very good care of us. Drinks never go empty and my dining companion's cherry Mr. Pibb always gets extra cherry just the way he likes it (and Spinner's been known to bring 2 because he finishes them quickly) and new black tea gets brewed when I walk in.  It really is the little things and being remembered that make the difference between good and great.  The food is hearty and portions are decent, though it's a tad bit pricey, but at 2am it's worth it to not have to do it myself.  Their meatloaf sandwich is awesome (minus the garlic mushrooms for me, but I don't eat mushrooms) and the Hot Pastrami and Reuben are equally tasty. Even the turkey dinner hit the spot one night (despite the mushrooms in the stuffing - and for me that's saying something). My late-night dining companion (who was born in the wrong era and should have been a \"greaser\") raves about the eggs bennedict.  He has tried several different variations on this including the chipotle style and liked them all. He is also huge on the shakes - the orange creamsicle is his favorite. We have literally come here just for a shake - they're that good. They even have a PB&J shake. Not sure that's for me, but it sure is interesting that it's an option. Thick and delicious and served with the metal cup on the side with the extras - 2 straws upon request, just like it used to be when life was (supposedly) simpler. Almost makes me want a poodle skirt and a pair of saddle shoes (and my virginity back ... well  maybe not).  Since this late night experience is a fun outing or field trip for me, the speed of service is inconsequential. The atmosphere is fun and the service is consistently great (Thanks Spinner!). Not much to be done about loud obnoxious drunk people except to avoid the post-bar rush if possible. But who can blame the barflies - 5 & Diner is the best place open at that hour. Period.  I have to say I've never visited in daylight hours, but the dog-friendly patio is a nice touch - not that I have a dog, but I'm an animal lover in general and I think there should be places where dogs are welcomed.",

After debating between chicken fried steak and the southwest burger I let myself be talked into the handyman burger.  it was HUGE.  2 patties, bacon, 2 kinds of cheese, fried dill pickle.  It could have been great, but unfortunately it wasn't.  It was overcooked and dry.  the kettle chips that came with, were great. We also ordered an appetizer sampler.  Excellent onion rings, good chicken strips & mozzarella sticks, lousy wings.   The butterscotch milkshake needed to be more butterscotchy, but I'm not sorry I ordered it. My biggest complaint is the prices.  My burger, the other half's hot dog, 2 sodas, appetizer & milkshake totaled just over $36. A bit pricey for a  late night dinner for 2 in my opinion.   I all honesty though, we will most likely try them again sometime when were feeling flush, just not late night.",

It is a classic setup with all the vintage artwork and lighting. The music; however, is modern, which wall it may appeal to a larger audience, somewhat takes away from the diner atmosphere.   Our server was a busy young guy, who's name is passing me, but he did his job well and us rowdy college kids with poise.   My main critique may seem overly critical, but the omelette I ordered, and asked for no onions on, came out with hundreds of slices of sauteed onions. While I just asked for them to redo the order, it was a hassle and can't be given a 5-Star rating because of it. Through and through, 5 & Diner is a great dive for anyone who is looking for a traditional styled diner.   3.8 Stars",

PERFECT!  3 eggs, over medium, and I mean they were perfectly cooked \"medium\", best hashed browns I've had since the Aristocrat in Boulder, awesome!  Went back two weeks ago, ordered the same the same menu; the food came up so quickly, it had to have been just sitting there, an overcook, whatever, it wasn't \"fresh\".  I know this much for sure: it wasn't nearly as good as the first visit.  Today, a late breakfast, I enter about 10:55am and I get the last table.  Now, I've been in the restaurant business and when the hostess fucking apologizes to the waitress for sitting the single patron at the last table, I'm already a little pissed.  I tell the server I heard that comment and \"...I'll TRY to be a good little patron\", kiss my ass.  I order right away, so probably close to 11:00am.  At 11:36, I give her a HUGE EYE-ROLL, \"where is my food\" and she say's she'll check.    She'll check?  [I want to take a moment to talk about CONSISTENCY.  If a restaurant is so prompt so as to have served me almost instantly on my prior visit, you cannot justify a 36-minute PLUS wait for any reason.  More on the \"reason\" why the order was so late in a moment]  I said, \"no thank you.  Allow me to pay for the coffee and OJ and I'll be on my way\".  The server was nice, mgt said no chg for the beverages -- thank you and there shouldn't have been a chg -- I even said to her, \"It's not your fault.  I have no cash, I'll come back with a tip.\"  Which I would have done had she not said, \"...it was the 'extra crispy' on the hashed browns.\"  In other words, my order was 20 minutes late because I wanted extra crispy hashed browns.  BALDERDASH!  THAT'S B.S  Last, TOO MANY FLIES!  GET A PEST-STRIP. SOMETHING!  I'll never come back.  Ever.",

The menu is basic, but isn't that what it should be if you're going to fully embrace the fifties? The food is not always spectacular, but it's usually more than solid enough given the restaurant's other merits. Just think. You can have breakfast at midnight and ice cream for breakfast if you'd like. I'm not recommending it. Just saying.   The restaurant is very kid friendly (paper hats and crayons). I can't imagine a child who would not enjoy sitting up at the counter. The patio is also dog friendly (water and biscuits).",

I don't know if there's a change in management but suddenly despite them being on Yelp this page, through GrubHub which is delivery generally, they only let me know it was for pick up after the fact when my card has been charged. When I calmly called and spoke to the first person who was nice and told me she would let the manager know I thought everything would be okay, the manager however interrupted me in the middle of me speaking calmly about the situation and told me she did not have to put up with me because I asked you not to interrupt so I can explain the situation and was very rude and hung up on me. Thankfully I will be able to get a refund through my bank however will I be ordering from them again? I don't think so and if you think you can order from delivery from them here think again because it might be a waste of your time.",

We split an order of the Diner Wings, which were great. And perfectly messy. Rebecca brought us lots of extra napkins and wipes; 'just in case' she chuckled. I had the Bourbon Burger special; Ric had the Reuben. The burger was cooked just right, and Ric really liked his Reuben. We both had the fries which were thin and crisp - just right. Unfortunately I can't eat dairy so we didn't try a shake. But we brought a piece of cherry pie home that I can't wait to try.  We both look forward to going back.",

Meat was very thin and from a pressed loaf. Had hoped for \"real\" turkey. My wife had a half tuna sandwich which I tasted and it was like eating tuna out of a can. It was very strong tuna, piled high in the middle with both ends of the bread empty. They say they have the best milk shakes in town however they were extremely thin and not thick and creamy for $6!! Sorry but I can't recommend this place. The two of us came out with a $35 bill!!! Not worth it at all.",

Waiting for 10 minutes didn't seem that bad up until a couple walked in and within a minute, they were being approached and handed menus. It's a pretty small place to completely miss 3 hungry people. Funniest thing is that on our way out we were told to have a nice day .  We were never disrespectful nor loud nor anything of sorts.

So I headed a few blocks east to 5 and Diner and was so glad that I did.  The place was packed, but only had to wait a few minutes to get a booth.  I did notice a lot of teenagers/under 21 crowd but it was a Friday night and this place is open 24 hours, no harm, no foul.  My burger and fries were delicious, nothing spectacular but exactly what I expected.  My wife who is a vegetarian, was able to substitute the beef patty for a black bean patty and she was impressed on how delicious it was.  The vanilla shake hit the spot also, very yummy.  Only complaint was the onion rings that accompanied my wife's burger were a bit soft and not crisp.    Bottom line, I'll be back on the late night sometime in the near future, I'm sure of it!",

After reading several Yelp reviews, I have to admit that I was hesitant. When I walked in I was greeted by a lovely girl in a pretty dress and smile. She seated us very quickly. Shortly after our waiter, Hannah came over and took our order for drinks. She was very pleasant and had just a big smile. Our waitress checked on us several times and was always nice. She even stopped and had a conversation and laugh with us. Hannah was awesome as our waitress. Hannah is great. We really got lucky.  The food came out very quickly. It was delivered on a warm plate and was very good. I didn't think that my burger was going to be cooked corectly the first time, but it was. The staff seem to enjoy their shift, everyone was laughing and chatting with each other. This is how an establishment is ran. The music was great and the atmosphere was definitely inviting.  This place really made a great impression on me. I Will definitely come back whenever I am in the area again.  All I can say is.. thank you for a wonderful evening.",

    "text": "We've been twice now, and nothing we have had has been very good. The ice cream and cake were mediocre, the onion rings were crispy-initially, the burgers were WAY overdone and made from cheap beef. Ask the bone chip in my husband's burger. The mushrooms were the canned pieces and stems variety, and the fries were crispy but heavy. The cole-slaw was excessively sweet and completely limp.   The service has ranged from complete disinterest- no greeting, no eye-contact, and I had to beg for refills- to interactions between employees so uncomfortable that I wanted to say something. It's great if you have rapport, but the customers don't need to see you slap each other around and overhear you gossiping about each other- even in play. Or, if you hate your job at 5 & Diner, please find another one and stop throwing the dishes around at a volume that hurts my ears and ruins my experience.   Management needs to intervene before this Phoenix institution falls apart.",

Very helpful and friendly service even if you're just getting a shake.",

Ended up here for some food around 11pm on a Monday after realzing after some (okay, MANY) cocktails that delicous vegetarian fare was now out of the question in Phoenix and I frequent the Jack in the Box near my homestead a bit too much. We taxi-ed it to 5 & Diner since I hadn't been there yet anyway.   I liked the interior, although the temp was freezing, we got a corner booth and our waitress was simply kick ass. I had to put together my \"breakfast before bed\" from scratch and she totally nailed it for me (yay vegetarian and lactose-intolerant!). I noted there was outdoor seating as well.   I remembered everyone mentioning the milkshakes and I surveyed the diner and everyone totally had one. :(. Jealllouuuus.",

Yes, it is a diner and a chain, but when I'm looking for a good, uncomplicated, non-fancyschmancy breakfast, this is where I go.  No waiting in lines forever for the newest trendy breakfast spot, we get seated here almost immediately because we sit outside.    I like the skillets, the omelets, and an uncomplicated egg breakfast.  I've also come here later in the day and enjoyed their burgers, while my friends have tried the meatloaf and other entrees without complaint.  This isn't fancy cuisine, it's diner food, and for diner food I have yet to be disappointed.",

    "text": "I've been here a few times before and each time I ordered THE BEST HOT DOG I'VE EVER HAD!  It's called the FRANCHEESE. What is the \"Francheese,\" you ask? Well, it's a simple hot dog injected with cheese, topped with cheese, and served on a toasted bun. Simple enough, yes? Seriously, it's delicious!  Along side that, I also ordered a side of a newly discovered favorite of mine (which I initially discovered here my first time): Wet Fries. What are \"wet fries,\" you ask?  Wet fries are french fries topped with a brown gravy. Most people thing \"Ew, that's gross,\" but think about it for a minute. What are french fries? Mashed potatoes. What typically goes on mashed potatoes? Gravy! It's perfect enough to work, right? (Just as my similarly strange love for ketchup chips) Well, it's an east coast thing, or so I hear (though I had trouble finding it most of the places I went on the east coast).  Regardless, the two items I've listed above made for an incredibly excellent meal the few times I got to order it.  Now, why on earth would I give a 3 stars on one of my top favorite meals? Because I went back a few months ago (Mind you, I live 6 hours away from the nearest 5&Diner) and they had entirely REMOVED the Francheese from their menu and it's not just this franchise, it was all of them that I contacted. They all got rid of their cheese injection machine and now my favorite dog is nowhere to be found.  5&Diner has potential to be a five star restaurant if they would only just bring back the Francheese [Please!]  That aside, they still carry the delicious \"wet fries.\" They also have delicious ice in their drinks (I like ice that has more air bubbles in them because it just break really easily in your mouth. Give it a shot, great ice.  The service is okay. They don't come by all the time to fill up your drink, unfortunately, and sometimes they let you sit for too long waiting to order or for a bill, but I'm never in a rush because I typically go there passed midnight.  And, best of all, most of them are open 24 hours and they have a pretty sweet diner theme with juke boxes and all the works.  If you could all help me, maybe we can coerce them into bringing back the Francheese. Haha. That'd definitely help me change my review back to a 5-star.",
