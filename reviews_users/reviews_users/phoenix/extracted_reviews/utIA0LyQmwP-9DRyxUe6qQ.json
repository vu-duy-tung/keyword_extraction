Our server, Michael, was great. He was fun and friendly, very thorough in answering our questions, and very knowledgeable of the menu. He continued to fill our waters and ask if he could get us anything even after we had finished eating. I will definitely look for him next time we eat at Snooze.  The food was great! If you get something from the sweet utopia section, be prepared! It is seriously sweet! That being said, it is sensational! We got the Pancake of the day to try, and between the four of us, it was plenty as a sweet treat!  We really did not have anything bad or negative. By the time we were leaving there was a long wait, so I would recommend going early as possible if you do not like to wait, however, it is definitely worth the wait.",

First, the setting: very nice, fresh decor and design.  The place was immaculately clean.  I was seated immediately ( I was there very early).   I had a hard time selecting what I wanted...everything on the menu sounded great.  I settled on a scramble with mushrooms, tomatoes and avocado, with a side of bacon and rye toast (it's sad how few places offer rye as a bread choice).   I didn't have to wait long. My plate was delivered in minutes. The eggs were perfect:  fresh, not over or under cooked.  Veggies were integrated perfectly into the eggs.  The bacon...I don't have the words to describe it...best flavored bacon I have ever had, cooked perfectly.  The salsa they provided (I could have red or green, I chose red) was delicious. And get this:  the toast was actually toasted... imagine that (too many restaurants do not get the toast brown enough). I very nice currant jelly came with the toast.   Their coffee was delicious, and my cup was never empty.  They have a full bar, and a bloody mary I saw served was irresistible, so I went for it ...it too was excellent. Their olives rule.   Service was super friendly and appropriately fast ( as in \"let me take care of you\" fast rather than \"hurry up so I can turn the table\" fast).   I was quite surprised at the prices...very reasonable given the quality, service and atmosphere.",

While the eggs benedict was really small, the flavor and quality ingredients were definitely there. The mozzarella on the caprese was divine and went well on a slice of ciabatta. And the prosciutto was a modern twist versus a traditional eggs benedict. The hashbrowns were okay and nothing I would rave about (not enough crunch or crisp for my taste). And don't waste your time on the breakfast potpie. I was excited to try it and it wasn't anything special. However, the rosemary added to the gravy was a nice touch. Lastly, the pancake was a nice little treat on the side, but nothing special (probably better off trying one of their more exciting pancake flavors).",

The Sandwich I am is probably my favorite thing on the menu! There's a sauce that comes with the sandwich and they've forgotten it a few times which is quite annoying and I've always noticed it was missing when I arrived home. The customer service is pretty good. The menu prices are a little high though for me. I think I'd definitely give another star if the prices were lower!",

It's so huge that it fills up the entire plate, so you only need to order one. I also love Juan's breakfast tacos. It's everything that I would want in a breakfast taco and I also add bacon to it. I bring everyone here, including my friendds that come to visit Phoenix. Everyone needs to be hooked like me. I must warn you that it does get extremely crowded on the weekends. I usually do take out on Saturdays to avoid the crowds.",

    "text": "How the mighty have fallen. :(  I reviewed this restaurant several months ago as I was making it my 'go to' daytime restaurant.  I had a couple of not so great experiences but at least I had an experience.  True, I had visited during quiet periods so service was always good.  Today is my birthday. A friend asked me where she could take me for lunch and I eagerly said 'SNOOZE', please.  She arrived first at 11am and requested a table for two. She was told there would be 15 - 20 minute wait.  I arrived at 11.20am.  By 11.30am we started to get hungry. My friend also noticed others who had come in behind her were being seated. At 11.35am she asked the young hostess who discovered she had removed the table request as the number was no good - she had taken down the wrong number.  Her apology was lacklustre and blase. We were promised a table 'soon'.  We waited another ten minutes until the crowds thinned and everyone behind us had been seated.  A rude young woman approached and said we were 'at the top of the list'. She was anything but apologetic.  Perhaps we were too old for Snooze?  By that time we had had enough, our feet were tired and I was holding a birthday bouquet of flowers.  We went to Grassroots where we should have gone initially. So many fabulous places in Central Phoenix and we chose Snooze.  Never, ever again.  So disappointing.   On the other hand, Grassroots, whilst not a breakfast eatery, provided delicious food and outstanding service.",

My new favorite place to go in the mornings. I'd like to give a shoutout to Angela, our server, she was one of the best and friendliest servers we had. I wish I could give it a higher rating then 5 stars to bring the average up because it deserves more then 4 stars.",

    "text": "We decided to give Snooze a try this past Saturday.  I went prepared for an hour plus wait and was pleasantly surprised to find out the wait was only 15 to 20 minutes. We put our name in and they texted us about 15 minutes later.  On time...great!  We immediately go to the hostess stand and were told our table was being bused and to wait off to the side.  Um...ok...  Ten more minutes go by so I went back up to the hostess stand to see what was going on.  She said that I was going to be seated any minute.  I look at my phone and they had texted me again despite me standing in the exact same place the entire time.  Weird.  Anyway, we are finally seated.    I order a diet coke and the waitress brings me a coke.  No big deal.  I tell her and she brings me a new drink and takes our order.  In the meantime, apparently Snooze VIPs are seated next to us as the manager spent several minutes talking to them and they were even given a free pancake.  Nice.  Good for them.  Not so nice is when they get their food before us even though we were seated ten minutes earlier.  A half hour goes by....still no food. Our waitress says it will be out \"any minute\".  More people that were seated after us are getting food and some of them are even done eating by the time ours finally comes out.  I ordered the French toast, which was good but not great.  It was two slices of wonder bread with a strawberry or two on top.  My fiance got a bowl of hash browns with some cheese on top.  I can't remember what they called it on the menu.  I guess the food was good enough that I would go back if the experience was better.  At this point it's not worth it for me.  We live less than a mile from Snooze and love to go out to breakfast.  Despite the convenient location, I don't think we will be back.",

    "text": "This new breakfast restaurant from Colorado is awe...some... I was super impressed, and the husband was too. I almost don't want to tell anyone because I don't want to have to wait for hours to eat here (ha.). So, to start, the restaurant is decorated cutely, definitely not reminiscent of the souper salad or whatever that was there before. We sat down and read the story of their coffee...I guess the owner went to Guatemala and personally picked out the coffee they use....pretty cool stuff, also was tasty. Then our waitress came by to see if we were ready, I told her I was between two things, and she said, oh well that's great because we order half and half anything for the same price....I was flabbergasted. What?!?! Yup. You can get half pancakes half tacos or two different types of benedict or half french toast half benedict or whatever.....that is the coolest thing ever!!!! I love variety, so this kinda rocked my socks. I ended up ordering half harvest bene and half chilaquiles bene. The husband got the pineapple upside down pancakes (PS you can get flights of pancakes...3 different types....ahhhh!). The harvest bene was good, had a goat cheese polenta cake, leeks, other fresh veg...with a perfectly poached egg and hollandaise. As good as that was, the chilaquiles was Ah mazing! Delicious roasted beef barbacoa, spicy tomato pico, another perfectly poached egg and a cheddar hollandaise....it was heaven on a plate. Even the potatoes were good (and I'm not a huge breakfast potato fan). The husband loved his pineapple pancakes....he said they were the best pancakes he's had in town...to quote him 'these pancakes were better than any I had on any Hawaiian island.' I will definitely be back and if it's consistently this good, it will be a five star for sure.",

    "text": "So, Snooze, huh? First of all, as much as I love my mornings, I have an equal and dedicated love with the \"snooze\" button. So, immediately, all I can think is \"I can relate...\"!  The atmosphere is absolutely perfect. Adorable and authentic. Diverse and yet coordinated and well put together. The energy is consistent. As in, the host was as personable and upbeat as the server without overdoing it... Because let's be honest here, there's a line between authentic \"radness\" and \"I'm full of shit and trying way too hard to be perky for a good tip\" radness. And let's talk about how great it is, that although there's a wait, you can walk right in to a complimentary cup of their fresh brewed Guatemalan coffee!! Now, I like my coffee untainted by sugars and creamers and the verdict is clear... They clearly drink this stuff in heaven.  Our wait wasn't too painful. A little longer than I necessarily expected, given the size of the crowd. However, it being a new restaurant and such a pleasure to be inside of, the table turnover wasn't as quick as some other places in Phoenix, i.e. \"Matts Big Breakfast\", that keeps you coming back because the food is phenomenal, but is so small that once you're done eating, it's time to dash before you get a rash on your arm from rubbing elbows with the folks at the table next to yours.   Anyway, THE FOOD! Because it's all about the food, right?  Oh. My. God.  I am a True junkie when it comes to French Toast and it's the first thing I try everywhere I go for breakfast, if of course they offer it. Not only does \"Snooze\" offer it, but they offer TWO variations of it, which I'm not sure I have ever seen anywhere else before, aside from your chains like IHOP etc.  The \"OMG French Toast\", stuffed with marscapone and topped with cinnamon, strawberries, vanilla, and... Wait for it... Coconut!.. Which almost threw me off from ordering it, because I'm generally not a fan, but I went for it. And I'm so glad that I did!!!This stuff is appropriately named, because there are TRULY no other words. Absolutely fantastic.!! Now, unfortunately, my 5th star was lost because the food did take a little longer than I think it should ever take for food to come out and it was a little soggy as if it may have been sitting on the line a tad bit longer than it should've been. I'm not going to say it was cold, because it wasn't. However, it wasn't as warm as I would've liked for it to be. Again, all of this is still MINIMAL for a brand new place just getting it's feet on the ground.  Yes, I've applied for a serving position at this spot. But, to be fair, this review isn't ONLY because I'm hoping like hell that they will hire me, but because this is a WONDERFUL addition to Central Phoenix for breakfast and brunch. I will have to check out their lunch menu as well in order to post a review about that aspect, but overall, aside from Matt's which has been in my own humble opinion, the best breakfast ONLY joint in Phoenix for years and Windsor's breakfast/brunch on weekends, Snooze is quickly behind and I have a feeling, is going to DOMINATE the morning scene sooner than later.  Now it's time to head home and snooze... Saturday \"after breakfast naptime\".",

What an incredible idea to get your staff trained and get people talking about your place!  We were greeted and seated within the first 3 minutes of entering the restaurant. Our waitresses (one was in training, and one was here from San Diego to help) were at our table very quickly and ready to tell us all about the place. Very friendly and helpful service! We were happy to listen as they told us that Snooze likes to use local ingredients, which was a huge plus!  They have a great variety of food items to choose from...I went with the Spuds Deluxe, which was a huge pile of hashbrowns cooked perfectly and topped with cheeses, scallions and two \"mixings\" of your choice. I chose wild mushrooms and bacon. Delicious! My coworkers enjoyed the pancake of the day (strawberry shortcake) and the breakfast burrito. I tasted both and they were amazing. ESPECIALLY the burrito. It was HUGE and tasty. The prices are also reasonable.   I'll save giving it a 5 star review until the hype wears off and they are open for awhile, but I have a feeling it's going to go nowhere but up. Very impressed. We will definitely go here again. Probably quite often!",

They might give you complimentary coffee but then they charge you on your bill $5!!! The server said I had the coffee at my table?! Yeah, I just poured a cup!!!! While I waited, why wouldn't I bring it to my table? Who charges 2.50 a cup anyway? Coffee is free refills at Overeasy ( best bkfst) .  Dried up chicken sausage and blueberry Danish pancakes was very underwhelming. Will not be returning.",

Of course was super excited when I realized they were building one in AZ.    I have only been to this location once since it is not in my neck of the woods. Went on a Monday morning on a holiday weekend so the restaurant was still busy. We were told the wait would be 30 minutes and given a pager. The wait ended up being much longer. At least over 45 minutes.  However, the restaurant did try to make up for it by bringing some blueberry pancakes to our table right after we got seated.  I am fan of their Eggs Benedict options. I love that they let you mix and match.  I like the Chilaquillas Benedict and the Caprese Benedict. Their OMG! French Toast is delicious and decadent. We always get one order to share with the table.  On the lighter side, their Quinoa Porridge is good too.  My kids love this place and their hot chocolate. They also have a great menu for Morning Cocktails.  Their prices are a bit high but you do get a great dining experience. The decor is very cool and retro. Expect to wait especially on the weekends. Can't wait for their new location to open up in Kierland because that is in my neck of the woods!",

I do keep going anyway though because I live nearby, the food is alright and interesting/different, and the staff and building are nice enough, but those first two things make me really me ask \"how bad do I want it?\"",

The wait is a little long on the weekends but it's well worth it, as the menu selections are out of this world. They use free-range eggs, there are lots of vegetarian options, and they have amazing breakfast cocktails. I highly recommend the breakfast scramble, which you kind of create yourself, as you get to select the fillings. The tortilla option is tasty (I think they're made in-house). On top of that, the pancakes are honestly the best I've ever had! I've only tried the cinnamon roll ones so far but they are so unbelievably delicious - I've never had any pancakes that come close to the ones at Snooze. Great customer service on top of it all - a fabulous place!",

Even though it's over 35 minutes away it's worth the drive for the food, the vibe and the service at this location. We got there around brunch and it was busy, but we were greeted with a smile and seated right away. Our server was wonderful and gave us some time to decide while he got our drinks. I ordered a mocha while waiting. It was pretty good, but I'm more into white chocolate so not my favorite, but it was presented well and just the right size. I wanted to try something new so I went for the OMG French toast and a side of scrambled eggs, and it was just that OMG! So good! Bread wasn't soggy, fresh fruit, didnt need anything added to it, and plated beautifully. My daughter had her favorite ham, eggs over medium, hash browns and toast. Everything was perfect. We chatted with our waiter a bit and he was friendly and attentive. Bright colored chairs, light fixtures and plenty of seating makes it so fun. There is also outdoor seating if interested. When we received our check our waiter also brought us a coupon for a free pancake on our next visit. My daughter loves the cinnamon pancake so she's excited lol. Very very good! Build one in Surprise please!",

You will give them your phone and they will text you when your table is ready.  I still love their menu. They have great variety of breakfast foods - brunchy things -nice amount of a.m. cocktails. Like a brewmosa-beer with splash of OJ. Who knew?:)  Waiters are great. Food is fresh and hot. Love the all natural sourcing for ingredients. Such as using a local dairy for dairy products or using real maple syrup from Vermont. :-)  Even when they are slammed, you don't have a too long of a wait to get your food. Added benefit- they make tasty gluten free pancakes, for those who need items to be gf. Now if they could just add misters to the patio seating, that would surely earn an extra two stars.",

The booths feel like they're from an old skating rink in the 50s- the entire vibe of the place makes you feel like you may have somehow entered a diner straight out of Pleasantville.   We sat down and decided to start with some beverages - the bloody, the bacon cocktail and some iced mochas. Everything was awesome, but the bloody was next level. There were so many things on the menu that looked awesome, but we decided to pick from the extensive list of Benedict options. We really enjoyed that this place allows you to mix and match - getting one of a certain kind and another different.   I had the quinoa patty one, which was awesome without feeling too healthy and the barbacoa one which seamlessly combined eggs bene and a huevos ranchero vibe. My colleague got one with prosciutto which he said was just ok, and the standard ham one which was good.   The service was good as well. If I lived here this would be my standard brunch spot.",

The decor is super cute and has a hip, colorful Jetsons diner feel. I wish I had a bigger appetite so I could try more, but I had:  Breakfast Pot Pie: I expected this to be more like a chicken pot pie in presentation, but it's basically the top of a chicken pot pie with the gravy and an egg on top. The pastry is super flakey and delicious, as is the gravy. It's not a lot of substance, but it's still filling!  Pineapple Upside-Down Pancake: So glad I tried this too - probably the best pancake I've ever had. The actual pancake texture was perfect and the pineapple chunks and brown butter were an incredible complement to it. I'm ready to go back for more of this...  The boozy breakfast cocktails looked amazing too. If I weren't driving, I'd have tried a few. I wish there were more places like this in NorCal (and open super late). It's the perfect blend of traditional late-night diner and experimental hipster cafe. Yes please.",

This time I got the pineapple upside down pancakes and they were delicious! Little bits of pineapple made it so yummy! I gave it 4 stars only because the bottom part of one of the pancakes were on the verge of being burnt and I tasted it everytime I took a bite. Not really a fan of burnt taste. I didn't eat all of it, and next time I will probably not get pancakes.",

    "text": "* Context: We came to snooze for brunch the last day of our three day extravaganza in Phoenix, celebrating my 30th birthday.   We rolled into snooze basically dead from a weekend of booze and irresponsible choices. (All parties were of legal age) Dre was taking care of us and right from the first moment she CRUSHED it. We essentially put our lives in her hands as she proceeded to select our orders for us, per our request. She took genuinely great care in asking us questions to help us select the right dish for our current mentality, even bringing us something that was not on the menu which made us feel spectacular! The food here was obviously amazing, but Dre was the highlight of the day for our weary crew of misfit toys. Employee of the year in my book. She went above and beyond to make sure we capped off the weekend in style and we are all eternally grateful.Someone give her a foodnetwork deal!  Thanks Dre!!!!!",

    "text": "It was an early practice day for me. I was preparing for an upcoming tournament, and by 5:30 AM; I was famished and wanted some breakfast to top off the morning.  So, I went all the way back home and dragged my Beloved wife out of bed and took her to this establishment.  By then, it was 7AM; and I wasn't really expecting a long wait - or so I told my wife. After all it was Saturday morning. Well, I was wrong! The place was packed, and there was at least a 20 minute wait.   There was a Dad and his teenage son playing ping pong, and the Dad asked if I wanted to play his son seems he had trouble beating him. Before I could even say yes, and run to the car to grab my custom made Table Tennis paddle; my wife gave me this look that basically said \"Stephen, do you really want to humiliate this teen in front of his dad?\"   I was in a quandary, but just in time; the hostess tracked us down and let us know that our table was ready. Situation averted!  We were sat down in a small table, in between two very friendly older couples that just wanted to chat up a storm. My wife was half awake, but I am my normal self and engaged both of them in small talk - nothing serious.   Our server was promptly took our orders, and throughout this experienced; proved to be extremely cheerful, competent and attentive. In spite of the competing demands of various tables that he had to wait upon, he didn't miss a beat.  And then came our meals. My wife had the Drunken Monkey French Toast. She joked that this dish reminded her of the times that I used to compete in Kung Fu competitions in the Southwest. And some of my form styles were the Drunken Monkey and the Monkey staff.  I thought it was cute that she tried to make a joke being only half awake, but she definitely woke up when she tasted her French Toast; because it was simply amazing!   The toast was light, as well prepared. Sweet, but not too sweet. It tasted way better than it looked. This was a home run as far as her selection was concerned.  I had the Snooze Classic, which came with Bacon, Eggs, Toast, and Hash Browns. And for good measure, I add a side of Plain Pancake as well.  The Bacon stood out for me because it not only was of a thick cut, but it was well prepared and not overdone. And that Pancake was so nice and fluffy. I considered ordering on more, but restraint prevailed.  Between the bustling atmosphere, great service, and the friendly patrons; it truly made for a great opening to a wonderful Saturday!",

The location is in the ASU college area, so their was a lot of college students. We started out with mimosas. I ordered the Om French toast and  my fiance had the breakfast burrito. The mimosa were great. The atmosphere was marvelous being outside amongst the chirping birds. Although it was 50 degrees it was still comfortable because of the numerous heaters. The service was excellent, staff very pleasant and welcoming. Checked on us numerous times . The food was delicious, wanted to order a second plate because it was so good. Definitely, a five star!!!!",

The bacon want over cooked or undercooked. It was a thicker cut and so much flavor! Sunny side egg was perfectly cooked as well. Perfect combo to the OMG French toast   Great breakfast!

Much better experience. My server (who also had someone training with her) did an EXCELLENT job. She was prompt with refills of coffee and water. I had the B.E.A.T. Sandwich with avocado and my husband had 3 scrambled eggs with churizo and onions. Service wise, I'd give this a 5-star rating.   Overall, the food was fine, nothing to rave about, which is why I gave this a 3-star rating. It's a very busy place and so expect a little bit of a wait. I'd say give this place a try to see for yourself if you like it or not.",

Heard of it? It's a stacked dish with tortillas, melted cheese and seasoned beef. The taste immediately woke up my taste buds! The circular hash browns were perfectly crispy and the poached egg was cooked with the yolk oozing out.  If you want to sample the sweet potato pancake ($3.50), order a short stack (one flapjack) because there is probably no way you can finish a full order. Dusted with powdered sugar, it was slightly over dressed by caramel syrup and could have survived with it's own flavor.   I arrived at 10AM and it was still jumping. Be prepared to wait and drool over everyone's order. Our service was pleasant and prompt.  Afterwards, I was ready to snooze!",

Now that the newness has died down, I met my cousin here for breakfast at 8 am. No wait! :).   I was torn because I was told their pancakes were delicious, but I didn't want to just eat pancakes. I love eggs Benedict, but I didn't want to give up my hash browns for a pancake...... The waitress let me know there were options! So I ended up w 1/2 order of the Bella! Bella! Benny and hash browns and added a blueberry Danish pancake.  My cousin let me try her Benny Goodman also! Everything was tasty.    Service was good. But it was a little loud in there.   I'll be back to try more goodness :)",

They give you the full on leaves and everything (you know it is pretty good tea).  I got the Breakfast Pot Pie, it was ok.  It was a little bland, needed to add a tab of salt.  I had to get the chocolate chip pancake as a side.  YUM!  The service was great too!  Hash browns could have been a bit crispier.",

    "text": "Update:  Cooperate contacted me with a VERY thoughtful and meaningful response.  I specifically appreciated commentary that everyone agreed this could have been handled better and that my review was used as a training opportunity.  Their response to my review was kind and professional... exactly what one would hope for from an establishment known to have a much better reputation then I experienced.  Thank you Snooze for reaching back out to me.   I will start off by saying that the seasonal eggs Benedict were absolutely delightful... but that is the only positive thing I can say about the whole experience.  I would have been happy to have this conversation with the manager instead of posting a negative review to yelp, but the interaction I had with the manager was already unpleasant and unapologetic so I didn't think complaining to her was going to do any good.  I ordered a water upon sitting down and 15 minutes later when I still had not gotten one I had to flag down my waitress to let her know to which there was no apology just an \"oh, I'll get you one.\"  It had been just over 20 minutes since we had ordered our food and we still had not gotten our food and so I asked our waitress to check on it... again I had to flag her down since she had not once on her own stopped by to check on us.  I saw our waitress go into the kitchen, come out without our food, print up a ticket, bring it to the manager who then came over to speak with us.   I was fully expecting an apology about our ticket getting lost in the kitchen or something to that extent, but instead she informed us that the reason our food was taking so long was because poached eggs take a long time and they have a special way of poaching there and a fresh batch was coming out and so we should have our food shortly.    It took almost another 10 minutes at this point for us to get our food and the plates were incredibly hot.  I've never had poached eggs take over 1/2 an hour and typically a super hot plate means the dish was sitting under a food warmer for quite sometime.    I understand that mistakes happen, but I would have much rather preferred an honest explanation and a simple apology.  Not once did either the manager or the waitress apologize for the wait or issues with service.   It's possible that maybe the really do have a special way of poaching that requires a 30+ minute wait on your food, but I would highly recommend letting your customers know that upfront.  That exact dish, from snooze, has been ordered before and delivered in a normal time frame.   To be fair, my friend has previously had the same waitress as today and said normally she is great.  Today, was not that.",

The wait is a little long once you hit 8 am., however I am \"lucky\" the twins wake up at 5:30am everyday.  After getting ready and gathering everything we needed we headed out.  We made it just after 7:30 am.  The only sad thing I realized this time is that the balloon twister person does not arrive until 9:00am.  Oh, well.  I am here for the food really.  I almost had a repeat of the first visit, but I decided to try a different pancake this time.  You can make any kind of combos.  So I decided for the Chilaquiles benny and the sweet potato pancakes.  I am torn, I think I almost liked the sweet potato pancake better that the pineapple upside down cake one.  I guess I have to go again to make sure.  The chilaquiles benny were so perfect.  Instead of an english muffin is a tortilla base round, so yummy, with a layer of pulled beef barbacoa, topped with a perfectly poached egg then draped with this creamy spicy sauce.  Sooooo good.  The kids had pancakes and my hubby had a breakfast taco plus the chilaquiles benny.  This time I also enjoyed the blackberry mimosa and the hubby had the am margarita, which was so strong he couldn't finish it.",

We waited about 20 minutes for the food and quite honestly it was just ok if that.  I have had so much better. The Corned Beef Hash was the best out of all of the dishes we had.  Bella! Bella! Benny was flavorless; don't  bother with the house hash browns they lack flavor as well. I wanted to try a pancake but was undecided so I let the bartender  surprise me. She picked the Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes which was...meh.  I almost felt it was a bit underdone.

Server was very nice but seemed over whelmed. I ordered a 3 egg scramble with cheese,  chiles, & spinach & hash browns well done   After waiting another 20 minutes food came and there was more cheese than egg & hash browns were raw. It seems like they use liquid or powdered eggs. Had to flag down someone for hot sauce. Another 15-20 minutes later the very nice server came back to check on me. I asked for another mimosa & mentioned about hash browns and was very apologetic and brought me some well done but I was already done. I will give them another try but I hope management reads the reviews and works out the kinks otherwise they will lose my business.",

Got the text to our table was ready and to see the hostess within 5 minutes. There was a woman ahead of me asking the hostess tons of questions so by the time I checked in with her it had been SIX minutes after the text and our table was already given to someone else, the hostess kept repeating that it was because we hadn't gotten back to them, I showed her my phone stating it had only been 6 minutes and she clearly saw me waiting to speak with her prior to that. Now we're seated, ordered pineapple juice and got apple juice. Our waitress probably couldn't hear us because of the ridiculously loud music playing  (not like the Snooze in San Diego where the background music is just that, in the background).  Food came out, lukewarm at best and the toast was NOT toasted. Hmm, cold breakfast meat. Will probably never return unless we're in San Diego. Get it together Phoenix Snooze.",

We were told that and had a table in 25 minutes. It gave us time to kick back on the sunny patio to enjoy some wonderfully inventive breakfast cocktails like the brewmosa, michelada, as well as five different versions of Bloody Mary and mimosas.   Our group had chilaquiles Benedict, ham Benedict and breakfast tacos. And you bet we added a blueberry pancake and peanut butter cup pancake. Everything was fresh and fantastic. I also recommend a side of smokey thick cut bacon.   Service was great. 80s music and clean diner decor gave Snooze a great hip vibe. The place is our new fave in Phoenix and we just may be back tomorrow.",

I've been in the food service industry for 20 years and trust me, folks will not think you're incompetent if you write their order down on a little notepad. They will, however, view you as a moron if you do not write it down and their food comes out incorrectly. She did not checkin with us to see if everything tasted great and the person who dropped the food off bolted away so quickly that we had not a chance of letting her know it was, in fact, not what we ordered. When the waitress finally dropped the check off, she again ran away, even though the debit card was sitting out on the table prior to her dropping the bill. We sat for 10 minutes waiting for her to return. She didn't. So, my boyfriend got up and interrupted her conversation with her fellow coworkers to have her run our card. Totally lame. Waiting tables is not rocket science. With so many other delicious options from establishments nearby that offer both quality service and food, we will not be returning. Bummer, snooze.",

We found a couple who was willing to play doubles to help pass the time. Fun times.  Alex had lots of suggestions, all of which were delicious.  He brought us some samples of the options we were trying to decide between.  I have tried all the Benedict options, I like them all. The stuffed french toast is really good if you are looking for something sweet. The oatmeal is good, but seems to be better during winter months. They change the recipe up a couple times a year pending what is in season at the time. I highly recommend waiting for a table during busy times,  it is well worth it.",

I'm not sure if they are always this crowded (sounds like they are) but we were quoted at least a 75 minute wait time for a party of 4 at about 11 am... so be prepared to wait, because this place is POPULAR (and doesn't take reservations)!   I'm not going to talk too much about the food, because it was all absolutely fantastic. I don't think there is anything that you could order here that wouldn't be delicious- my personal favorite, however, was the pineapple upside down pancake that we ordered as \"dessert\"- I was disappointed that I was too full to eat the whole thing myself right then! The service was great, as well. Despite being packed to capacity, our food seemed to come out very quickly and was definitely still fresh!  We ate inside because of the weather, but there were quite a few people outside on the patio. I walked through the patio to get out to the parking lot though, and it was pretty miserably hot. It didn't look like they have misters, or if they do they weren't on. Any other time of the year I would suggest the lovely patio, but I recommend skipping it for the summer, unless you're into that sort of thing.  A special thanks to our server, Meghan. She truly helped to make Father's Day special for my dad!",

    "text": "The food was good, service was terrible. I came an hour early to reserve a table for 10 with expectations that it was going to be at least an hour wait. We ended up waiting an hour and a half which was fine. But didn't get our drinks until 30-45 min after we ordered. We waited an extra hour to get our food. There were people next to us that came in after us who got their food before us. We were a big party so initially they gave us 2 booths, which I had told the hostess prior that as long as the tables were close \"like these\" and pointed to the open round tables then it's ok, they misunderstood so we asked if we could use one of the round tables and get extra chairs and we squeezed in. There were 3 tables next to us that opened up shortly after but when we asked if we could use one those tables, they told us it's reserved for party of 13, they seated a small family in one of the big tables and another party in the other. Since we had arrived early, waited nearly 2 hours for our table and an extra hour for our food, I would think we could reserve a bigger table for a big party, seeing that they put a party of 4 (2 of them being children) on one of the large tables next to us, when there was a table and booth near the back of the restaurant that they could've seated that family at. They had put a small 2 person table to add on the round table after we had asked to use the other tables and was denied. The small table helped even though it was awkwardly placed. After we got our food, we had received all our checks shortly after. I'm sure they were rushing to get us out. One of the dishes were cold and mojito was watered down. It was very unorganized like it was their first time with a large party. I would only recommend coming here for the food and no larger than party of 5.",

I got the Ham Benedict III (English muffin topped with shaved Tender Belly ham, poached cage free eggs, and smoked cheddar hollandaise), which was absolutely delicious. My friend and I split a Pancake Flight (choice of any three pancake flavors), which I really appreciated because I wanted to try the chocolate chip and the peanut butter cup pancakes (both delicious). The restaurant had a fun retro vibe and the service was great. This particular location is in the Town and Country Shopping Center, so there was plenty of parking.",

While the food options served are tasteful and great ideas, the service never seems to be that great. Often times the hosts are rude, and the servers make it obvious that it's just a job, and could care less if you're there.   When I had visited before, I was charged for an option on my meal without any clarification that it would be extra until the bill arrived.   This visit our food took almost an hour to be served, while the people who sat next to us after we arrived were served well before us.   The cup I received had particles sitting at the bottom, and lipstick smears on the rim. After requesting a new glass, I received another dirty one.   I understand that this place is often busy, but they had plenty of servers to accommodate. I've worked in the food industry for almost a decade, and I know that when fully staffed on busy days, it's easy to take care of your customers.   I think after so many bad visits we won't be trying this place again.",

    "text": "You guys, I am a foodie let's start there. I have someone at home who cooks freaking AMAZING so......when I do go out I'd like to eat something A) different or B) better than I could get at home, otherwise why bother? So.....it'd been awhile since I was \"amazed + excited\" about the food at some other restaurants but this was an AWESOME experience. It'd been on my yelp must visit soon list for quite some time and finally made it. Went on a weekday around 2, not too busy (yay! as I hate waiting for a table). We ordered the pancake flight with pineapple upside down cake (good but not as amazing as the others), blueberry danish (holy moly!) and sweet potato (wow! blew me away). We also got the breakfast pot pie with hash browns and personally I ordered the Ancient Grain Benny. Where do I begin? First off, I LOVE benedicts! I am often disappointed or just ok'd by most places but here they offered me something different. Check it out, it's a must for vegetarians. You've got roasted vegetable farro cakes that on their own would've been amazing (that's the base) a house made tomato ragout that I wondered if I'd like (loved it) and a cream cheese hollandaise. It's also got quinoa and black rice (can we get any more nutritious than this?). Guys and dolls, seriously this was amazing! It was filling, tasty as heck and I must've said wow at least 5x. Everything we tried was crazy good. Even the hash browns, not greasy or tasteless like most restaurants where you need salt and ketchup to go along with it. These hash browns just had some good as heck flavor. I was truly excited about my entire meal, I wanted to start it over again. Cannot wait to go back to Snooze. I did not realize it was a chain but man they're doing some awesome things. I've now moved Snooze into my yelp collection of \"fave places to eat\". Thanks snooze, everything was amazeballs and I cannot wait to take all visiting friends and family to your establishments!",

I thought that was nice, especially since they were very busy!  I ordered the omelet that had chorizo in it and my niece ordered their scramble with sausage and turkey along with fresh veggies. We both had fresh orange juice to drink. I enjoyed the fact that they were not overpriced for their food and it was great size servings and yummy!  I know I have seen quite a few of these restaurants around town, so you have no excuse to try this spot! Great for breakfast, brunch or lunch!

The best splurge is going to be the Bella Bella Benny with hash browns... smashed down, of course, so they are crispy. Since I try to limit consuming 2937292728 calories before noon to special occasions only, I've tried many other options on the menu that are equally as delicious, and not as likely to put me in a food coma. My current favorite is the grain bowl, which was surprisingly satisfying and just plain yum. I used to adore their smoked salmon plate, but it seems to have disappeared from the menu. Cocktails are great for brunch. With the feedback of all the out-of-town guests I have taken to Snooze, the consensus is that EVERYTHING on the menu is superb.",

This time Angela was our server and she was friendly, really helpful with my friend's gluten-free needs and forthcoming with what she liked on the menu and recommendations. This seems to be the norm for Snooze.   We were seated promptly and decided on drinks. A Bankok Bloody Mary for me, consisting of MEll Vodka, Sriracha, Lime, Cilantro, Basil, Fish Sauce & House Bloody Mix. I added a nice slice of bacon which was just delicious. T. had something called a Cherry Pie cocktail which was tasty.   Breakfast for me this time was the \"Sandwich I Am\", a soft pretzel roll filled with scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese and a sausage patty, served with a side of smoked cheddar hollandaise & house hash browns. Arriving at the table it frankly didn't look like a lot of food on the plate, but let me tell ya: it was more than enough. The hash browns are served as a round patty (from a mold, I suppose) and are moist with just the right amount of crispy. The sandwich is really tasty, especially on the pretzel bun.   Snooze offers a pretty extensive list of breakfast selections, not the least of which are the pancakes. There's usually a \"pancake of the day\", one time being an apple-filled pancake which was, to this day I think, the best damned pancake I've tasted.   I'm not often in the area of Camelback for breakfast (though there are a number of locations in the Phoenix area) but Snooze is high on my list of stops. The service is exemplary and the food is always above par.",

Pancake flights: highly recommend so you can try all their pancakes! I got the lemon poppy, unsidedown pineapple, and chocolate peanut butter. My personal FAV is the lemon poppy that came with a mascarpone lemon butter. It was the right amount of sweetness and the lemon add a little zest to the pancakes! It's the only one I actually finished! The pineapple was okay, nothing spectacular. The chocolate peanut butter was so rich I wish I'd orders a glass of milk! Though I couldn't finished I Togo it! Can't let good food go to waste!   Benny Benedict: which lets you mix and match the egg Benedict's (extra charge if you wanna get the steak Benedict) I got the pulled pork and salmon. Both were amazing! I really like the pulled pork (forgot the name) but it came with salsa on the side and it was sooooo good! Also their hash browns is amazing!

First of all it was super busy but we were able to sit outside right away it was nice and sunny!  Our waitress was sooo nice!  The hot cocoa she said would be the best I've had and yes it was I was craving some now that I'm back home!  The eggs Benedict was the best we ever had it was perfect and the hash browns on the side amazing as well!  Since we were there from out of town our waitress brought over a pancake for us to try had blueberry and cream cheese it was good! My boyfriend also loved his mocha!  We can't wait to come back to visit again we will definitely be coming here!  And bring one to Oregon please!",

I figured a simple breakfast burro was be a good choice to not get burned by and instead, was wowed by its complexity and flavor! Great green chili sauce and crunchy onion atop black beans n scrambled egg. A bit too much hash for my liking which is very common with this style of breakfast meal. I added avocado and was glad I did. This thing is a beast (huge) yet I was almost able to finish it! Jack and Nichole were an awesome part of the service team! They took time to explain why Snooze isn't like all the rest. Their \"we believe in our product\" vibe and the fact that they asked me to \"please come back again\" made me feel even better about supporting this Denver based establishment. I'll be back for sure!!",

It was pretty packed too so the food took awhile to come out. I found the blueberry pancake to be borderline disgusting, it didn't even have blueberries in it. It was just not very good blueberry sauce and watery frosting. I would have given this place 1 star but the server was pretty good considering how busy she was. I definitely won't be coming back and don't understand the hype. I would prefer IHOB over this place.",

The french toast served with strawberries, mascarpone and maple syrup was so Yum. My omelette had caramelized onions,cherry peppers,mushrooms & cheese.(you can choose your fillings).  The only disappointment was the Hash brown it wasn't crispy at all.I'm not sure if that's the way they serve it. They also have bunch of morning cocktails i had the Mmm mm Mimosa(Snooze Sparkling, Orange Juice & Pomegranate Liqueur) that tasted more like a plain orange Mimosa.  I'm definitely going back for those pancakes.But the wait time has to be endured (they are on a first come first serve basis).  Cheers!",

    "text": "Dropped in to this place on a recommendation from a friend. Considering that it was 11am on a Sunday morning, the wait was only about 25 minutes and they texted me when our table was ready. I like that idea because it means we can browse around the shopping center while we wait. It also shows me that they support their neighbors by not restricting customers to a 10 foot area around the entrance.  I really like the open layout. We had a nice table on the patio, which was quieter than inside. I started with a Gaspacho Bloody Mary.....it's my day off and it's the first time in months I haven't had obligations, don' t judge ;-)..... The Bloody Mary sounded great on paper, but didn't live up to my expectations. I would say that it was the only thing disappointing about Snooze. I'm willing to be forgiving though because it really is just a brunch place and the focus isn't on cocktails.  I ordered the corned beef hash breakfast. The corned beef was amazing!!! Almost as good as McMullen's in Vegas. My eggs were perfectly over-medium and the portions were just right. Enough to fill me up without being so much that I feel like I'm wasting it if I don't eat it all.   My daughter ordered the continental. She said that the grapefruit brulee was the best ever. I tried it and it was pretty damn amazing. They fire raw sugar over it to give it just the right infusion of sweet and tart. She liked the Greek yogurt, but found the agave syrup a little too sweet.  To finish the meal, I ordered a Kentucky Coffee.....again, hey, it's my day off and my kid was driving.......although a little heavy on the bourbon, it was really yummy and completed our brunch beautifully. It also was responsible for the amazing nap I had when I got home.  Overall, the Snooze brunch experience was excellent and will probably become a regular place for me. I can't wait to try some other menu items.",

We started at the bar which was easy to get into because there was a break between chairs in the middle so that people on the wait can get to it easier.  We waited 30mins for a table but this place was well worth the wait. And the drinks are big so they lasted. Friend got a bacon Bloody Mary and was pleased with the flavors The Chilaquiles Benedict was amazing. Hash browns cooked just right! Asked for an expresso martini and they said \"sure! What's in it?\"  I told them.... And it wAs made perfect but not in a martini glass but a glass. And who cares. It was cold and yummy!  Our server Alex (I believe his name was) provided amazing and friendly service",

We got there at 8 and we waited for 10 mins which was bearable.   The best breakfast I've ever had. Stepdaughter said it was the best pancake she's ever had. We had the pancake flight (chocolate chip, pineapple upside down, cinnamon roll), chile verde Benny, breakfast tacos, ham Benedict and a sausage and egg sandwich. All the pancakes were to die for!!!!  I never finish my food but I devoured my chile verde Benny.   It couldn't have been a more perfect meal. It was seriously worth the drive. Will definitely be coming back.",

The music playing reminded me of the late 1990s early 2000s when I was still in middle school/high school.  The servers were fantastic.  I ate chocolate chip pancakes with homemade chicken sausage.  This place is so good I plan to return on Sunday.  Date of Return Visit 8/9 12pm approx.  Note: If you want to come here, avoid Sunday midday.  Come earlier in the day, or come during a weekday.  I went & they said 45-60 minutes waiting for a table.  Since I was in a chess tournament & could not afford to wait that long for food, I opted to order takeout instead.  The takeout option was worth it - I loved the breakfast I had - their sausage was good, the upside down pineapple pancakes were good, & I enjoyed their hot chocolate.  I recommend coming here during non-peak visiting hours, & ordering food to go during peak visiting hours.",

I give this place 4 stars not 5 because although the food was delish, the service was slacking and the music was on the extremely loud side which could be good if you have loud kids or are in a tired mood and need to be jolted out of your sleepiness.  They were closing at 2:30 so that could be the reason we had gotten the slacking service. Everyone seemed to be more focused on doing their side work and getting ready to leave.   I suggest ordering the pancake flight. It comes with 3 pancakes of your choice. I enjoyed the sweet potato and blueberry Danish. There's nothing else like these pancakes. Really flavorful and unique. You can get them gluten free as well.",

    "text": "So I braved coming back to Snooze (on a Friday to avoid the weekend brunch crowd) and I have to admit, I actually LOVE the food here.  What comes out of that kitchen is freaking amazing.  I haven't had anything but benedicts, pancakes, and hashbrowns and they are, no exaggeration, the best benedicts, pancakes, and hashbrowns I've ever had anywhere.  Not sure if it was the fact that I was there during the work day on Friday or if my last visit was a complete fluke but my mom and I ordered at 10:44 and got our food (two benedicts) in about 10 minutes, which was a huge improvement from the last time I went (on a Sunday), so I feel I need to upgrade my review based on that experience which was definitely 5 Stars.  Yes there is a wait for a table, because the food is really, really good.  But they are SUPER accurate with their wait times so you should know what you are getting into before putting your name on the list. Plus there's an amazing Nordstrom Rack next door so in my opinion the wait is more like a welcome invitation to shop.  They text you when your table is almost ready, and there is plenty of stuff to do in Town & Country so it goes by pretty quickly, and as long as the food comes out as quickly as it did last time, the food is totally worth it.",

I recently ordered a very large catering order for a business meeting, and I was so impressed how well they put the food together.

The incredibly scrumptious breakfast delights and the excellent customer service from the wonderful management and staff have put Snooze on our \"favorites\" list.  Please ask for Claire who made our first time so very special.  She took such great care of us and provided a wonderful surprise.  The Benny Duo allowed us to taste the Chile Verde Benny and the Chilaquiles Benedict.  We savored the perfectly poached eggs, the very flavorful barbacoa and pulled pork meats all placed on ranchero and green chile sauced layers of tortilla.  We also recommend the Pancake Flight--your choice of three different pancakes.  We were delighted with the Pineapple Upside Down, Sweet Potato and Blueberry Danish pancakes!  These are the best pancakes we have ever eaten!  The pancake is perfectly cooked--truly a \"pan cake\"--delicious, light and very hard to stop eating!  Be sure to ask about the \"cinnamon roll\" pancake--it's not on the menu.  Worth TEN stars and more!!!!!",

    "text": "I have seen this place many times and was always curious to try it because it always seems to have a line-up on the weekends during brunch time. Now I know why. This place is strictly breakfast and lunch and they do them both well and it is BUSY. The menu is interesting and the vibe is fun. Servers wear hipster plaid and trucker hats. the menu is fun to read as it is a tad cheeky which I love, but the main reason to try Snooze is the food. Bar none, for the money, this is some of the finest brunch food in Phoenix. Their Benny's are creative, their breakfast meats have that down-home feel: real sausages, thick cut ham steak, thick bacon strips. There are plenty of veggie options as well for those not inclined to partake of salty flesh. The service has always been very good and they seem to manage their line-ups well offering toys and sidewalk chalk to keep the kids busy and free coffee for the adults waiting of tables. This is the rub and why I'm not giving this place 5 stars: the waiting. Unless you arrive super early or unless it's the middle of summer you will likely have to wait for a table. I'm not the type of person who is willing to wait very long for a table, especially for breakfast. I'm ok to lounge in the bar while waiting for a dinner table, but if all I have on board is some hot water with lemon and an espresso from home, I need to eat NOW! otherwise I end up unreasonable and Hangry. All 3 times I visited between 10am-noon I have had to wait at least 20min for a table, and once it was more like 40 and that was on a weekday. They will take your name and cel number and send you a text when your table is ready which is a nice technology-forward feature to managing wait times. Feel free to go next door and browse the racks at Nordstrom's while you wait. Also, once you do get seated, because the food is so well made and nicely presented, it takes longer to hit the table than your usual slop n' drop diner breakfast. The bottom line is is you are 3 or more in your group and it's between 10am and noon on a weekend and you guys are STARVING, I would go elsewhere. However, if you had a snack at home and are willing to put in the time, their food and service are worth the wait. The servers have the option to \"give them the pickle\" ( Anyone in the biz knows what this means. Google it.) and drop free food items on the table which can be the pancake of the day or some other delectable item to share which can stem the tide of famished glances towards the kitchen and is a nice touch. This is likely a great place to take the person you hooked up with last night for a first breakfast together, just be sure you have had a piece of fruit or something before you leave the house otherwise you may end up in a hunger-fueled tif on your first venture out together in the light of day. I usually try to take my out of town gets there for a meal when we have visitors because it is a bit of a Phoenix institution and I always enjoy the nosh! Don't hit snooze too often, get your butt outta bed and get to Snooze!!",

The wait for 2 adults and a 2yr old was about 25mins, it was packed! But I think the wait was worth it. If you have little kids coming with inform them because they do have high top seating. The lady seating us was a little worried about our kid sitting up so high, which was nice because nowadays people tend not to care at all. But we told her it was okay and so that's where we sat and it worked out fine but just a small tip for parents because we didn't realize this and it helps them find appropriate seating for you. Our waiter was a young man who was really nice and answered any questions we had. When we asked for some time to look at the menu he didn't just pop in every 2-3 mins bugging us which was nice. He was very busy with several other tables but he made sure to be attentive to us as well. The food is supposed to be on the healthier side, they use cage free eggs and natural ingredients. Definitely would go back and bring the family when they come visit.",

Luckily they text you when your table is ready so we did a bit of shopping while we waited. Our waitress was really nice and attentive despite the morning rush. I ordered the Ham Benedict III which was absolutely delicious, and my roommate had the Sandwich I Am which was also very tasty. Both came with hash browns that were amazing! It was a tiny bit loud, but otherwise a very pleasant atmosphere!  Overall a great experience, I will definitely be back.",

When the hostess finally got back to me she realized what happened, never apologized and said there would be 1-2 tables ahead of us. After waiting another 25 minutes checked back with the hostess and said they were told we were sitting at the bar. We've been standing there for 45 minutes and they kept looking at us. After telling them we were leaving they said they'd put us back on the list and there's only be 1-2 tables ahead of us. Why wouldn't you get us seated next? We left and probably won't be back. You need a better system for people waiting!",

Clearly looked like our actual waiter was late to work and the rest of the staff tried to pick up the slack.   Nearly $10 for Corned Beef Hash and the portion is rather small.  Definitely not enough potato to meat ratio.   Hello ... Ever heard of a plate warmer?  Pancakes do not stay warm on a room temp plate.  The chocolate cherry daily special was delicious. But, half way through the meal even the best pancake is disappointing cold.  Same with the Pineapple Upside Down pancakes. Really good, but not cold.   Finally, loud grudge crap music has never been \"cool\" - \"hip\" - or whatever term you want to use in a breakfast joint. Who wants to have their hearing assaulted in the morning?",

Snooze is an excellent place for an amazing breakfast. I always get a half order of the eggs benedict and then share a flight of pancakes because o.m.g. they're amazing! The pineapple upside down pancake...wow....could there a better pancake? NO! But the chocolate chip comes in right behind it. Also what I love are their hash browns because unlike other restaurants Snooze actually seasons their hash browns wonderfully. I generally hate hash browns and avoid getting them but at Snooze I have to have them! You can order anything and won't be disappointed. Service is always great and the place is really comfortable and clean. This place is a winner for sure! Oh! And if you're going for someone's birthday breakfast, quietly tell your server and he'll bring out a birthday festive pancake with a candle! Very cool.",

When we saw that there was one in Phoenix this morning the only question was how fast can we get there?  This location was just as good as the one in Denver. The staff was friendly and attentive. We were sat at the bar and then asked to move over 1 spot each so another couple could sit next to us. For our trouble (none) the waitress sent us a free pineapple upside down pancake. We ordered the Benny Goodman (eggs Benedict/lox creation) and the Pot Pie (spin on biscuits and gravy). Everything was great. Always busy so be prepared to wait. I would have no problem waiting for an hour, maybe more.",

For 9:30 am on a Tuesday they were very busy, and we were told there would be a 15 minute wait, or we could sit at the bar right then. We chose to sit at the bar. Our coffee was brought right away and our cup was never less than half full! Our food came very quickly and was delicious! I ordered the quinoa porridge and it was AMAZING. My boyfriend got the OMG french toast and he absolutely loved it too. The service was amazing as well, very friendly and attention! Thank you snooze!",

Really bright colors, orange, yellow! Sunny and happy! We sat at the bar only had about 45 minutes before our flight home.  Melinda ( I think) was really great, friendly and took great care of us and was fun to chat with. I had a great chili infused tequilla iced cinnamon coffee and a grapefruit, pama, elderflower MIMOSA! So fun! Also, their Champage was on draft!!! Food was great too! I had the winter harvest eggs benedict and really great bacon! Wish we lived closer! I would totally be a regular! Thanks for a fun time!",

Seriously both of those are amazeballs and will send your taste buds into ecstasy!!    Only complaint is that they lack seating and during their busy times they rush you out once you are done eating... a bit more than any other restaurant.  So I wouldn't suggest going on weekend mornings during busy times if you want a nice relaxed breakfast.  You will feel quite rushed and won't get to enjoy the place.  Kinda sucks but I guess they have to get as many people seated as possible.  Still worth it for a good breakfast.",

I hate sweet things for breakfast but thy managed to make it not gnawingly sweet - instead it had notes of creaminess and butteriness , salt and fresh strawberries . For the meal I had the Bella eggs Benedict with crispy hash browns . If you ask for them crispy they actually deliver and flatten the pile to brown them all over . The Bella was delicious , the prochutto (can't spell that (: ) was a salty and they give you enough to really taste it in the dish . The cream cheese hollandaise was decadent , the arugula fresh and peppery , and the balsamic sweet . A perfect combo of flavors , I wouldn't add anything . My friend had one chilaquiles Benedict  and she has gotten it multiple times because she loves it so much . The wait was not bad for us because we were there at noon and the outdoor seating was shady but no misters or fans to keep you cool . For the good food sitting outside in the summer was worth it , just plan for a wait of some kind . The waitress was great and all the staff was very nice . I almost forgot , the drinks are amazing ! They have a large menu for a breakfast spot (lots of options just like the food menu) . I got the grapefruit elderflower mimosa and I had two it was so yummy . My friend had a chai drink with coffee liquor , fantastic . Try it all !",

You sit so close to the table next to you so there is no privacy.  The first time we tried this place was not impressed at all.  Dirty tables, loud music from the kitchen competing with the loud music in the dining areas and food was cold and not at all good. This is expensive food for breakfast.  This time the food was better, not awesome but at least tasted good.  Still music from both dining room and kitchen trying to compete.  And still loud atmosphere.

They make it from a make line and they can't make regular Hollandaise at any point because it \"throws off their line.\"   I'm over it, the food is tasty but the staff are always flustered or over worked, and asking for something besides directly what's in the menu is always a fiasco.  The hipster crowd looks just as good as the food but for the price I would choose a different Benedict place for sure. But if you want to be seen at a cool place this is it, but not my type.",

We were clearly upset by this as we had planned for the long wait that is expected here accordingly, but were upset as we were left standing in the lobby.

I imagined they would taste more like True pineapple upside cake with that wonderful brown sugar caramelized pineapple taste but that didn't happen. They were ok but I think they could do a better job on them. Now back to the sweet potato ones. Absolutely mouth watering. I can't wait to go back in and make them my main event.

There was no cheese in the grits. No green pepper or jalapeno. The egg yolk was overcooked and broken. The cocktails were pretty good. The only saving grace is that I can help people not order the shrimp and grits. Yuck.",

    "text": "I'd love an opportunity to shake the hands of the Schlegel brothers during my next trip to Denver to thank them for doing something that not even IHOP has managed to incorporate into their menu.  The ability to mix and match your pancakes.  You've heard of craft beer flights, but here they've got pancake flights.  Seriously, why didn't anyone else think of this?    At any rate, my first venture to Snooze was at their Town & Country location around 7am on a Saturday morning.  Even at 7am, the place was quite busy, though I was able to get one of the few vacant spots at the bar area.  As a side note, the last vacant seat at was taken up right next to me about 5 minutes later by none other than Phoenix Suns great and Grand Canyon University basketball coach Dan Majerle.  I guess this place must be popular, huh?  Thunder Dan sighting aside, I came here for one thing.  Well, actually three things.  A blueberry danish pancake with a lemon cream cheese filling, a sweet potato pancake with caramel and pecans, and a pineapple upside down pancake with cinnamon butter.  Oh and I decided to get a chicken sausage patty on the side because, well, yes.  Total cost for all this plus water, tax, and tip came to about $17.  Of the three, the blueberry danish was my favorite.  The lemon cream cheese filing is what makes this one and the sweet cream on top helps mellow out the acidity very nicely.  The pineapple upside down cake was my second favorite thanks largely to the cinnamon butter which I basically could put on just about anything.  The sweet potato pancake was my least favorite though it certainly wasn't bad.  Just a little bland in comparison to the other two.  If you're doing the pancake flight here, my recommended plan of attack is to stack a bite of all three at once.  That's pretty much the moment you know you've arrived in pancake utopia as I did.  The chicken sausage was fairly light and had a little spicy kick to it that I didn't expect.  Great breakfast (or more accurately, morning dessert) to start a Saturday.  Based on the morning traffic it seems like they get busy pretty much from the word go here.  Not Matt's Big Breakfast busy, but still pretty busy.  So get here early.  Snooze may have been born in Denver, but they've made Phoenician breakfast lovers (my friends and family included) swoon for awhile.  And seriously, find any excuse you can to put cinnamon butter on your breakfast from now on.  I know I will.",

    "text": "Look, I get it, sometimes places are just so busy it's hard to be on top of your game. We were told our wait for a table would be five minutes but after waiting patiently for forty-five minutes I finally went to the hostess and she said we had been sat already. Well, I'm here to say we haven't so either someone took our table when our name was called or what I think is our name was never called and we got skipped. We waited right by the door and never heard our name. The hostess didn't take our phone number because it was supposed to be a very short wait to begin with. The hostess did immediately get a table for us because of the mishap. Our experience would have been redeemed had the food been better. My husband did really enjoy his Sandwich I Am. I got the French Toast Neat, it came with a marzipan cream rather than butter and the bread used was a bit too dense. The hash browns are highly onion flavored. But worst of all--there was a long curly hair on the French toast, what? Ew. I am disappointed because Snooze came so highly recommended by local friends. Honestly, the best part of our experience was how wonderful our waiter was. Sadly, I am not sure I will give this place a \"next time.\"",

The extensive menu selection should not be the only thing that makes you want to come here; service was great, they messed up part of our order and fixed it quickly and didn't charge us. Sweet and sour combinations for breakfast are incredible. My only gripe with my meal which was eggs with pesto or something of that sort... There was so much pesto it was really hard to taste anything else. But this for sure is an amazing breakfast place. The sweet potato pancakes are delightful.",

Both occasions it was over an hour. But is it worth it?? Yes! Breakfast food is my favorite & they know what they're doing. Nice portions, great flavors & if you have a sweet tooth, this is the place to be! They're kind of known for their amazing french toast & pancakes, at least among my friends. The atmosphere is causal & bright! It can get really loud which works well if you're in a group or have kids with you. & even though they're extremely busy, service seems to keep up! Once seated we didn't have to wait very long to get drinks or have our orders taken.",

As I debated between sweet dishes (my go-to at every breakfast restaurant) I noticed the option to try three different ones. I got the pineapple upside down pancake, blueberry danish pancake, and the OMG French toast. I was stoked to find out that you can choose 2 pancakes and 1 French toast for your options! All three were absolutely decadent. The pineapple upside down cake was probably my favorite as I am bias toward pineapple anything, but the OMG French toast was something special too. My bacon came out crispy as I asked, and my iced caramel latte was good but nothing unique. My grandpa ate every bite of his corned beef hash, and my grandma enjoyed her breakfast pot pie however wasn't a huge fan of the gravy. Regardless, my meal was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. Our waiter was a joy as well. I wish we had one of these where I live!!",

The rosemary sausage gravy...it has bits of carrot in it.  Not the first thing I would think to put in gravy.  Not a good choice in my opinion.

If you decide to visit Snooze you better be hungry, or plan on sharing your dish with someone else, because the portions are large and the food is delicious. This place was crowded and ee had to wait to be seated but it was worth the wait.  I highly recommend the \"pancake flight\", three pancakes of your chosing. I went with the peanut butter pancake, pineapple upside down, and sweet potato pancakes. All the pancakes were delicious but the peanut butter will knock you out. My lunch companion decided to go with the ham and eggs benedict and he said it was the best he's ever had.  Service was friendly. With no complaints from either of us, definitely looking forward to my next visit.",

I didn't care for them. The pancakes themselves lacked flavor and the toppings weren't sweet. I would've rather had the addition of maple syrup and butter. I did love the lemon cream, however. It was tasty. I also ordered scrambled eggs that were cooked as ordered and pork belly bacon. The bacon was super good. My almond milk cappuccino was creamy and strong with a cinnamon sprinkle on top. My breakfast was right around $21.  There seemed to be a diverse crowd of happy diners. The staff were having fun with each other and the customers. The decor was cute.  I would definitely go back. I saw a yummy sounding chai drink on the menu that I'd love to try.",

We had to track down the waitress for our bill after waiting 30 minutes for her to come near the table again. The restaurant was super loud and almost impossible to visit in.

It is hard to mess up two over-easy eggs and they did not.  The coffee was on the weak side, then I lived in Seattle for a long time.  It is hard to meet this bar.  Interesting the next seat neighbor was very particular to his order and spent 30 seconds correcting errors he experienced last time.  On the other side, the customer had a conversation with the server on her ethnic origin (she had three very distinct origins from both Asia and Europe).  Guess this is a very friendly eatery.",

    "text": "So, the last time I tried to got to Snooze, right after they opened, was a disaster.  They were mobbed, and the noise level was approaching the danger zone.  Today, the wife and I just finished a hike at Squaw Peak and she suggested we try it again.  0730, and we were seated immediately.  Prompt and friendly service got us coffee in minutes as we read the menu.  Wow, what an extensive menu, so many choices that sound so good.  Well, I am a green-chile lover, so I homed in on the Chile Verde Benedict.  The wife had an Avocado Benedict with Green Chile Hollandaise.  A moist stack of corn tortillas, soaked in Green Chile sauce was topped with a savory mound of pulled pork (you can also get it with shredded beef) and two perfectly poached eggs bathed in a Green Chile Hollandaise sauce.  A perfect circle of hash browned potatoes accompanied this most delicious dish.  Our breakfast was as exception as the service.  My only complaint is the background noise level.  Around 15% of Americans over the age of 18 are hearing impaired.  I'm one of them.  Around 0800, the noise level elevated substantially as somebody turned on the music with some driving rhythmic beat that was anything but relaxing.  It was too loud and too busy.  The crowd of people in the dining room responded by talking louder.  When I cannot have a normal conversation with my partner, it is too loud.  Yes, I know, we could have, and should have taken a table on the much quieter patio, it was just a bit cool this early in the AM and I hate eating hot food that is cold.  Anyway, perhaps background music with a softer side?  For example classical, jazz or easy listening?  Anyway, all noise bitching aside, it was a delicious breakfast and you can bet I will be back for more.",

Used my ALWAYS reliable yelp app and found snooze. Showed up and it was PACKED...I mean, so packed!!! That was really the only downfall....which is no fault of theirs (other than being too amazing I guess). I'm telling you...Snooze is SO GOOD!!! I can honestly say they had the best eggs Benedict I have ever had!! So...on to that....I had the pick two Benedict (one original...amazing & one Bella...also great), the husband had corn beef hash...which he is super picky about, but he really liked it; our friends had the avocado toast and the breakfast tacos....they both LOVED their meals! Now...if you go on a Saturday and can get seated with Olivia...you are in fantastic hands!!! Almost everything we got, were recommendations of hers!!! She was so amazing and attentive....and....because we had to wait a little longer than normal, she brought out a sample of the \"coco-banana\" pancake (not sure the exact name)....AND IT WAS LIKE A LITTLE TASTE OF HEAVEN!!!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",

Our waiter brought my date her pancake first, then came back 3 mins later and I quote \"they didn't bring you the right pancake did they\" Well no they didn't, but what do you mean they, YOU brought it..  No manager insight for a table touch, the server came out and \"swear I didn't forget about y'all\" as the table across from us who ordered 15 mins after us got their food before us. I'm not one to make a scene being that I am in the industry, but I figured a yelp review would be sufficient.  So, about 2 hours worth of a wait for small portions and an expensive bill from a server who didn't seem to care enough to advise a manager to come by and see how we where doing.  I will not be back, ever again. There are better options for the same price and bigger portions who actually care about their guests.",

We then shared the pancake trio (blueberry lemon, pumpkin and the flavor of the day which was sweet potato), all were sooooo good! I got the Benny duo which is your choice of 2 halves of eggs Benedict, I got the avocado Benny and steak and eggs. The steak and eggs benedict was my favorite out of the two, it was so tasty! I also love a place that cares about the environment (no straws!), kudos to you snooze!",

Literally my favorite restaurant. We knew it would be crowded but risked it anyways. Wait time was 20-30 min and there were plenty of stores to browse in the meantime. They notified us via text that our table was ready. The menu itself is overwhelming. So many choices that you want to try all of them. I ordered the Shrimp and Grits & the Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes. Best decision of my life. I've only had shrimp and grits in New Orleans and this blew my socks off. I thought the sausage was a weird touch when I was debating my decision but omg it completed the dish. To say it was amazing is an understatement. So filled with flavor. It was perfect. The pineapple upside down pancakes were great but make sure you order syrup also. A little dry but didn't deter me. There was plenty of seating. Ambience and decor were so cute. Our server could have checked on us a bit more but I can overlook that. We sat outside but there were heaters. My friend ordered the AM Manhattan and it was so good. I am definitely going back. Honestly hands down one of the best restaurants I have been to.",

    "text": "I would have to say that this restaurant is a hard pass.  I was okay with the 45-60 minute wait, which was completely in line with the actual wait of about 50 minutes.  The service and ticket times left much to desire.  Our food took about another 50 minutes from order to table.  During the wait our server came by once with drinks, once with water refills, and then once to ask how everything was going about 45 minutes after placing the order.  When we mentioned the ticket time her response was the order was placed and it's in line in the kitchen.  The host then came by and apologized for the delay.  Once we finally got the food three of the four entrees were cold so it turns out the delay was the kitchen didn't make one the four entrees.  For the two entrees with eggs, they were both cold and dried out on the top.  Simply asking a server about a 45 minute wait should not result in a response filled with attitude.  During our entire breakfast which turned into lunch the server came by five times.  The two additional times were to deliver the food and then the bill.  After asking about the long ticket time she ignored us for the rest of the meal.  That being said, the one entree that was still warm was good.",

On a Friday morning, it was pretty crowded, we had to wait 30 mins to get seated for a party of 8. Server seemed bit lost, he served the coffee without sugar. We requested sugar and he did not return for 10 mins while the coffee was getting cold. They were out of OJ so the kids had to settle with lemonade. Food came out after 20-25 mins, overall it was good but one of omelette had multiple hair in it.. so gross... we had to leave the dish as is.. we did not have time to re-order, so we shared from other plates... We were not charged for the omelette but still it was a very bad experience.    On the good side, The french toast was one of the best that I ever ate.. Will I go back? Yes ... hoping the management will take my review in a positive way and fix the hair problem as it is not acceptable.",

I don't care if the wait is always 45 minutes.  I'll wait.  It's worth it.  I talked about their chorizo breakfast tacos to anyone that would listen for weeks.  The porridge is amazing, sweet potato pancakes delicious.... I have yet to find something not unbelievable on the menu.    If you're looking for breakfast, go here.  Do some shopping while you wait, then come enjoy the deliciousness while you are sitting out on their patio area enjoying the sunshine.",

(Their rent must cost a thousand lifetimes of savings per month)   Let's address the kicker. It's not what I would call the most timely experience, but I get it ... breakfast is supposed to be a relaxing 2 hour journey through roasted coffee beans and hash browns .... but ... The reason it's called snooze is because you'll be able to get in a solid snooze in before anyone comes and takes your order.   The food itself along with the menu is diverse and tasty. So no complaints there really other than being over priced. The staff is friendly and upbeat and Im sure part of the wait has to do with the line out the door so I guess that says something positive.  Fry me up some eggs n turkey bacon! Were not going ham on this one (Cause I hate pork) but Snooze is well needed in this location so I bumped you guys up a star ... I can see the quality in ingredients is truly there and the attempt to create a clean green contemporary breakfast selection is fantastic.",

The decor is adorable; the manager calls it \"a cross between 'Happy Days' and 'The Jetsons.'\" The service is wonderful and the food is outstanding. We especially appreciated the generous, unexpected portion-size sample of the \"pancake of the day,\" the particular variety of which changes every day, we were told.   Our orders came out quickly and at the right temperature, although we purposely got there early (about 7:45 a.m.), so I don't know if the same applies when they get super-busy, as apparently they always do by 9 a.m. on a weekend day.  I mentioned to the manager, who with genuine interest and friendliness came up to the table to ask how everything was, that the portion size of the pineapple pancakes was enormous. She informed us that almost anything on the menu can be customized at least to some degree. So we could have ordered one pancake instead of two and one that was somewhat smaller in diameter. We will definitely keep that in mind for next time.   I recommend the quinoa porridge. It has currants, cranberries and raisins and is delicious (and is appropriately portioned).   Just a great overall experience. We will definitely return.",

Servers friendly but a bit aloof",

The niece and I look at each other but our hunger takes over and we agree to go for it. We're approached by Joe, who cracks a joke about her ordering a cappuccino but she hasn't had her coffee yet so she does not care that it's gonna be a scorcher today. He helps us navigate the menu and we ordered the pancake flight which we had about 6 choices (you get 3) and we chose pineapple upside down cake with a creme anglaise, sweet potato with brown butter butter and the daily special which was like a smoothie kind of flavor on a white chocolate pancake. Yum!! We also shared the hash browns with cheese and 2 choices of meats, sauces or veggies. We got onions, bacon and spinach (.75). Plenty to share. 2 drinks later and 31 bucks. Totally reasonable and absolutely delicious. Top all that off with Joe's amazing service and you have a recipe for \"Im going back\"!",

Need more healthy options, though, as well as a more complete coffee menu. (Their coffee drinks are not good.)  The biggest challenge with Snooze is the incredibly long wait to be seated --as much as 2 hours on weekends. Also, the foods on the menu should be a rare treat, not regular fare.",

    "text": "I came here for the latest get together of the Breakfast Club. We usually get together on Saturday and not quite so early but this time we had to go Sunday because of other events and went early to beat the crowds. I didn't know it was a chain. Of course I had never even heard of it before but I'm glad I did. We sat outside I think because there were so many of us but it was great weather for it. I poked my head inside and it was very nice. Even though there were 14 or 16 of us, I lost count, our server did a great job. She was always checking on us and refilling drinks. Sure it took a little while but we were a large group. I like how they let you mix and match things to create just what you want. I got the blueberry pancakes and the French toast. I got the toned down French toast because I'm not a fan of coconut and something else that was on it. But it was still really good and so where the pancakes. I saw some good looking Benedicts around the table. I will have to try one of those next time because this time I was in the mood for pancakes then the French toast sounded really good too. I had a great time. Saw some Yelp friends that I feel like I haven't seen in a long time plus I got to sit next to one of my favorite Yelpers the beautiful Cheryl. I will definitely be back. I want to try some of the other things on the menu but the pancakes and French toast were great. I could not even finish the pancakes. They were huge but so good. I had to stop myself from eating more. Shout out to some Yelp friends: Meagan B, it was nice to met your stunt double lol your Mom, and Jennifer O and her husband and the staples of any great Yelp event Jon H. and Amy H. See you guys later.",

No kidding... the service, the ambiance, the food, the coffee - everything was top notch at this place. I ordered the Breakfast Pot Pie with a chocolate chip pancake on the side. My husband got the Bella! Bella! Benny dish. Their menu is healthy and organic/free range where possible, which is very important to us. Soooo much better than IHOP, Denny's, Perkins or any other chain. We left feeling satisfied and light (not heavy & sleepy with indigestion). I'm just salivating remembering how delicious it was. It's a great place to have a reasonably priced breakfast if you are staying at the Royal Palms Resort & Spa like we were, or any place nearby. I would go to Phoenix just to eat here again, that's how much we liked it!",

It was busy so it took a very long time for it to come out, but totally worth it. I really appreciate that they let you do a duo for the Benedict. I couldn't decide between two different varieties and got one of each for the same price. We ordered French toast for dessert - now I've had my fair share of French toast, but this was by far the best. We usually order a half portion for dessert but decided on a full and boy, I'm glad we did because I downed pretty much the whole thing and my BF got like a bite or two...maybe. Usually not a food hog, but It was just that good.   Our bartender was super cool - she realized she made a regular mimosa instead of a pineapple one for someone and offered me the incorrect one instead of just spilling it.   Snooze was on our list of things to try when we visited Denver, but we didn't get the chance. I'm SO glad we were able to in Phoenix!",

There was no wait time to be seated but unfortunately waited for nearly 15 minutes for anyone to take a our drink and food order. Then never got refills on drinks until she brought the bill. The music was so loud you couldn't even hear the person next to you. Only giving 3 stars because the food was decent. Will not be recommending this place to anyone and will NOT be visiting again.",

Snooze does not shy away from custom creations or substitutions. This is refreshing because their policy ensures that you will get exactly what you want for breakfast/brunch.  If you are a breakfast traditionalist, try the Snooze Classic.  You will get a sampler of eggs, choice of meat, toast, and hash browns.  If you are more into pancakes, they feature a pancake of the day, such as coffee cake.  I highly recommend the sweet potato pancakes and the pineapple upside down pancakes.  Of course they do have delicious plain pancakes as well.  This place is always a win and will not disappoint.",

    "text": "I went to Snooze yesterday for breakfast at 10:30 a.m. off the recommendation of a friend who said \"the Benedict and Corned Beef Hash are to die for\". The location, right next to Postino,  same decor, same beautiful outdoor patio seating. We were greeted and seated right away. Our drink order was taken. We waited a bit for the waitress to take our order, she seemed very interested in socializing with the other tables.  Our order was finally taken, we ordered Iced Tea, Iced Vanilla Latte, Corned Beef Hash (Snooze's signature shredded hash mixed with artisan corned beef, caramelized poblanos and onions. Topped with two eggs your style & toast or tortillas), and Ham Benedict III (The classic evolved with our signature English muffin topped with shaved hickory smoked ham, perfectly poached cage free eggs and smoked cheddar hollandaise).  The food came, couldn't ask for anything better, the Benedict was perfectly done, my Corned Beef Hash was fantastic, refills of my Iced Tea was flowing. Excellent breakfast foods, ordering service could of been a little faster, but all in all I would definitely come back.",

We order 2 to 3 times per week from this Snooze, breakfast to go orders.  When ordering we ask for a couple of tweaks or add on's nothing complicated or unusual yet two out of three times the order is wrong.  They even read it back to you on the phone and manage to still get it wrong?  We have called and pointed it out, we have called and complained, makes no difference.  I am not sure if it is the kitchen messing it up or the hostess, also not sure why the orders are not checked for accuracy when they come out.  I know we are not the only ones as on several occasions we have ended up with other peoples entire order, or some thing in our bag we did not order or pay for meaning someone else's order is no doubt missing that.  I am about to call the manager as the order we just picked up.//// is wrong.  We are talking about 3 breakfasts, that's it, and they can't get It right?",

    "text": "Deliciousness - 4/5 Happiness - 5/5  I don't know how anybody could argue that this place is not the best. My out-of-town relatives demand to be brought here when they come. There is always a line, even in well-over-100 degree heat. The biggest flaw? The place simply needs to be bigger.  The eggs are always perfectly cooked and there are far more options than the typical bacon and sausage for your meats. As a non-pork eater, I almost weep with joy that I can get some high-quality soyrizo in my huevos rancheros and easily the best chicken breakfast sausage I have ever had in my omelets. The pancakes are very delicious and they have new ones weekly. The one we just tried? Dark chocolate, banana chip with a walnut crumble topping. My personal favorites are the sweet potato, blueberry and chocolate chip. I'm not a pancake guy, but the options are so plentiful and diverse, even I have to occasionally order them.   I will admit that the hash browns and bloody marys are a bit lacking. The hash brown stack they give you are always a bit wet and while they look good, lack any crunch or flavor. It is total empty calories in my mind - I'd rather have the fruit or another pancake. The bloody marys are always on the more watery side and I feel like they never get the balance right. Their other alcoholic drinks are far better, particularly the mayan mocha, which is spiked with some vodka.   Finally, kids love this place. There are often people making balloon animals for the little ones, and a ping pong table for the older kids.",

Mostly the food is good,  but it depends on the chef /cook of the day, and who you get for service...how can you mess up pancakes? Really?

Checked in for two letting them know we have a dog so we need the patio. After waiting for an hour we are sat at a two top right in the middle of the patio. No room for our dog as the pathway was maybe two feet wide so the whole time we would be eating she would be in the way of servers and patrons. Asked if we could move to either of the open tables and she was not willing to move us because she had a \"list\" to go by. We were just on that \"list\" and were at the top of it so you should make sure that we were priority. Total disregard for us your customer who has made snooze a frequent stop. Not anymore, you have forever lost our business and i will make sure to spread the word about. After being in the service industry for over 8 years, I know what needs to be done to satisfy your customers and you did everything but that. Don't be a dog friendly patio if you are not willing to do anything and accommodate your guest.",

I usually do one of two things. The burrito, so similar to a chimichanga. The Chilaqiles Benedict are pretty darn good.  This week was national pancake day, so I decided to go to snooze. They had a portion of their pancake sales going to a hospital charity so I loaded up and went a bit out of my comfort zone. I ordered the Spud Deluxe and THREE different pancakes ( a portion of each pancake went to a hospital charity) For my pancakes I chose the Velvet(I'm not a chocolate fan but just sounded good) second I chose a banana glaze, walnut, and sweet creme cheese type of pancake( just the sound of the name creme cheese makes me eek cause I am big on cream but it was still good.) to finish it off as a dessert I made my last pancake are the PINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN CAKE. I love those pancakes. For my spud deluxe I added Avocado, an egg, and slow roasted pork. It was both delicious and large in portion. Being from Colorado I LOVE everything about this place. An even though there is always a wait, even though they're not as busy as their Colorado locations I still love everything about this place!",

Loved the ability to pick two Hollandaise dishes from the menu and chose the meat/Mexican one and the Benny Goodman (lox). Both were excellent, as was the toast, sausage and coffee - no mean feat. A new favorite in Phoenix - in the top few with Farmhouse in Gilbert and Matt's in Phoenix. Wait staff was very friendly - lots of people came over and so it was fun, but wondering if it's really efficient? One point off because the free coffee only comes with plastic cups that were recently washed and frankly looked unappetizing. Paper would be much more sanitary. Nonetheless we'll be back.",

I am surprised that with so much business and such a selection of breakfast items, there's literally nothing on the menu. Scramble has quite a lot of vegan options (8 to be exact) and is consistently good, though I like the atmosphere at Snooze better. Please include some plant based options so I can visit you again!",

We walked in and there was a wait but they have this cool feature in which they just text you when your table is almost ready so you can go anywhere in the shopping center. Great idea! We sat outside because it was a beautiful day and we were greeted right away by a waitress and a lady that was training with her. They were both very outgoing and friendly. We were so hungry we could not choose so she told us what we should each get and we ordered it. When we got our food it all looked amazing and we decided that we would split everything so we passed the food between all four of us and it was perfect. We had the: -Breakfast Pot Pie: absolutely delicious. Very tasty with all the flavors you need in each bite. -Snooze Breakfast Burrito: HUGE! This thing was so big that we could not even finish it! All flavors combined into a burrito... I couldn't tell you what was inside but it was all mixed beautifully -Ham Benedict III: wow I could not believe all the flavors in each bite and how perfect it was! -Pancake Flight (Pineapple Upside Down, the Carmel Apple Pie and the almond joy): now this changed my life because I love pancakes but when you make them different flavors of other desserts its just too much for me to handle but I enjoyed every bite and it was a perfect finish to the amazing feast!  We rolled out of this place very full, happy and with a lot less dollars because its not cheap but it is worth it!",

The food made the wait...worth wild. I appreciate the servers and manager for making things right for us.",

We've had to wait just under an hour on a busy Saturday morning, but it's worth the wait!",

But 22$ for one person is a little pricey anyways so probably won't be going back, because of the servers lack of caring about the customer",

It's kind of expensive compared to the portions you get, so if you're very hungry it's not the best place. Overall, it's alright, nothing super special, but it's still good.",

A lady sitting next to us raised her eyebrows and nodded her face, lol! I tasted their Danish pancakes and link sausages.  Pancake (2) dish is super dense, while it  tastes great l found it to be dry despite the load of sweet cream and blueberry sauce.  Sausages are excellent, it comes as a set of three links.  I wish they made their pancake a bit fluffier!  Ron chose the buttermilk pancake and felt the same way as l did about the pancake texture.",

I had an order of buttermilk pancakes with a side of sausage links and my wife had an order of Danish pancakes and also a side of sausage links. The sausage tasted great and the pancakes also had a good taste to them but they were a bit on the dry side. They are extremely dense caused them to be on the dry side. They need to be \"fluffier \". They are very busy on Saturday mornings so if you're looking for a quick get in and get out this is not the place for you. Don't give them a negative rating because you felt it took long to get your food. If you need to eat quick bite to eat go to McDonald's not a good place like Snooze.",

Arrived around 1 pm on a Saturday and found them still to be quite full. 20+ min wait for best available if you needed a table. Since it was just my wife and I, we were able to sit immediately at the counter. Attended to in a timely manner; they'll have coffee mugs upside down on a bevnap; if you want to automatically get coffee without having to say anything, just flip it upright and they'll fill it (a little rusty on my diner protocol.)  My wife had the Sweet Potato Hash and I the Smashed Avocado Benny. We both liked our selections, but we both opted to add some Cholula as a little extra heat is preferred. Service was attentive and upon our future visits to see our son performing with Ballet Arizona, we'll likely return.",

Overall- Excellent presentation, great service and unique decor/clean restaurant.  Flight w/ sweet potato, pancake of the day (board was not changed) and cinnamon I think. Food came quickly but I realized POTD was not what the board said at the front of the store. No worries tho because my server said I could swap for any other pancake on the menu. (Or the OMG F. Toast)   Couldn't decide between the Nana's seasonal and the blueberry danish, so guess what? My server gave me both at no additional charge!! Score   Turns out those were my favorites anyway! Amazing flavors. My least favorite was the recommended sweet potato but will be back to try them all!!  Pancake addicts and aficionados must come and eat! Enjoy",

The mimosa was good and very tart and gave me a nice buzz. the Bangkok bloody mary was very interesting but had a lingering fish sauce taste that I think most people might not like. We ordered the OMG french toast and the Reuben and the dishes were pretty amazing! the french toast was fluffy and soft and very flavorful. the corned beef was tender and delicious and I loved the soft pretzel bun!

    "text": "Do. Not. Come. For. The. Coffee.  Even though there is a special stand-up card on every table speaking sooooo highly about the quality of the restaurant's coffee and it's super special artisanal-ness, it was burnt swill. I drink coffee rarely anymore so when I decide to have a cup I'm very selective. After reading said little stand up card I thought, surely for all this marketing, there must be something to the coffee here. Not so much. It was worse than the burnt roasts at Starbucks. And to be fair - in case the particular pot that poured my cup had sat too long - I requested a new cup from a fresh pot. Same thing. Even the manager that I spoke with after the meal rolled his eyes when I talked about the coffee and basically said it had the quality of gasoline.  But I get ahead of myself. Let's return to the beginning because the coffee is not alone in the mediocrity that was Snooze that day.  When you come during a busy time, expect a wait. That doesn't bother me at all - the bustle of an exciting and popular restaurant and a little wait tells me that many folks are happy to be eating there - and it's usually an indication of great quality food and service. Once a table became available, we did get stuck in a back corner next to a pile of high chairs, the swinging back patio door, and under an air conditioning fan. The only thing that saved me from freezing was the regular opening of the door letting in the warm summer air as servers went in and out. So not the best table and not the best climate control, but all in all that wasn't going to get us down.  The restaurant was slammed. I might also say that during busy hours, Do. Not. Come. For. The. Service. It's so disappointing that we as patrons should need to avoid certain hours of the day because waitstaff whose job it is to know how to wait tables properly during their ENTIRE SHIFT simply cannot manage to hold it together when it's time to MOVE QUICKLY AND SMARTLY.  Our server couldn't manage that. We waited for someone to take our first drink order (that lovely coffee) an unreasonable amount of time. Once she showed up, she was distracted and never once looked us in the eye. Every interaction with her during the visit found her constantly looking ahead to her next task, her next stop - so much so that she seemed to already be gone from the table by the time she got there. And to top it off, she put on the fake sugary patronizing voice that makes it SOUND like she cared about what was being asked for, but her mind was elsewhere. And when we did ask for something - cream, natural sugar - it took an unreasonable amount of time to receive it.  It's unfortunate that now I can't remember much about the food. I think it was fine - maybe even inventive. I might have had a Benedict (?) with an interesting rendition of asparagus (?). I think my husband enjoyed whatever he ate too. I waited too long to write this review for starters, but my memory of the food is eclipsed by the poor service and the supercilious attitude of our server.  But then there was also this.  Two women were seated at about the same time next to us. They ordered pancakes (JUST PANCAKES) and REQUESTED the pancakes be cooked well in the middle. This order was taken right around the time of our coffee order. Their pancakes arrived right around the time our food order was taken. The pancakes were RUNNY in the middle. They sent them back.  The server that was working with them didn't apologize, didn't assure them that it would be made right, didn't demonstrate care one way or the other that the kitchen messed up or that she put crap food down for two people she's supposed to be caring for. Her attitude was rather that she was terribly inconvenienced by the whole thing and it now threw a wrench into her works.  Our food came. We ate - leisurely and talking. Out of the corner of my eye I watched the table next to us. They sat. And waited. We ate. And talked. They waited some more. No one came to tell them it would \"be just a few more minutes and we're so sorry for the mix up\". At one point someone came and delivered a side of bacon. OF BACON! They had the balls to slap down a side and run away when the main course wasn't even present. Poor, poor, POOR SERVICE.  We finally finished our meal. The pancakes finally showed up. It had to have been 20-30 minutes later. For pancakes, people. Pancakes. A 6-10 minute dish and you couldn't be bothered to get it together and treat these women well.  Pitiful.  We paid. And after stopping to express my apologies to the women for how they were treated at Snooze, I went straight to the manager to tell him just how piss-poor their service was. (And how the coffee was burnt swill.) To his credit, he said he would make it right immediately and he was confident the ladies would be happy by the time they left. I really hope that meant comping their entire bill.  Do better, Snooze. You're not \"all that\".",

We tried 7 kinds of pancakes with a \"Pancake Flight\" for each of us, plus a special house pancake called \"Sinner's Delight\" that blends maple and bacon.   Also gave homage to the Chillaquera Benedict and breakfast tacos, including the house hash browns. Topped it all off with the Socialist Pig and Rocky Mountain Mule cocktails, along with a cup of their delicious coffee.   Literally everything we had was beyond delicious. The atmosphere is great, the service is friendly, and the food is fantastic. Definitely worth the wait!",

Awesome patio and open-air bar seating.  Good selection of mimosas and bloody Mary's ($6-8 each).  Food looked good, even though we didn't order anything.  Good location at the old Town and country mall, but I wish it were closer to central.  Staff was friendly, but definitely still working out the kinks. We had quite a wait for two mimosas and a beer.  Overall, I'm giving Snooze the benefit if the doubt and I will definitely be back to sample the menu.   Ps, I don't know if it will ever make it to five star status since it's part if a CA/CO chain.",

Eggs and bacon with crispy hash browns delicious.  I don't know how they do the bacon, but it was better than any bacon I have ever eaten.  Someone ordered the corned beef has and eggs and from someone who has tasted corned beef has in many many restaurants, this was the best we ever ate.  Guatemalan coffee was rich and robust.

The pineapple upside down one has sooo much things going on, while not overpowering the pineapple flavour from the pancakes. The chocolate ones are sooo chocolaty but yet not overly sweet.  The chorizo side is really tasty; mixed their hashbrown with one of their hot sauces was another good option if you choose to go the savory route. but you can always add a little extra and have the pancakes to come with your savory brunch dish, so you don't have to face the sweet or savory dilemma :D",

No checking in, no refilling of beverages...bum deal.  The food - eh. Ordered the Reuben & Sweet potato pancakes. Ruben was cold, dry, and really lacked in flavor, the pretzel bun was just ....overwhelming. Pancakes were surprisingly flavorless - this was really a drag as we were so looking forward to them.

I got the pineapple upside down pancake. They were really big, enough for two mwals(there were 2 pancakes). The taste was good, but not as good as I was hoping though. My step-dad tried them and really liked them though, so it is really just individuals personal taste. I tried my mom's hash Browns and they were really good. Overall all three of us enjoyed our food and left as satisfied customers. It's a great place to go for breakfast.",

Shared some pancakes with a friend, the peanut butter pancake was delicious, the chocolate chip was good too but a bit sweet with the chocolate.   Ordered the pot pie breakfast and it was a egg over easy (your choice really) gravy with sausage over a flaky crispy flour bed, tasted like biscuits & gravy to me. Hashbrowns were ok, nothing amazing there.  The staff is good, this morning most waitresses were dressed as Disney Characters which was nice.

This location is convenient to my house and apparently also for a lot of other people because there is always a wait! I have had a few things from their menu including the Snooze Continental {house made granola | Greek yogurt | Agave nectar drizzle | Grapefruit brulee | choice of toast} which I think is the perfect light but filling breakfast. I have also had the Benny Goodman {Eggs Benedict with Lox style salmon and cream cheese} which is to die for! Seriously I was skeptical of salmon with Hollandaise sauce but it is fantastic! My most recent visit I shared the Blueberry Danish Pancakes and the Quinoa Breakfast Bowl. Holy smokes guys, the pancakes were perfect! A perfect balance of sweetness from the blueberry coulis, sweet cream and almond streusel with a lemon cream cheese filling. The quinoa bowl was equally as satisfying (and a bit easier on the waist!) with heirloom carrots, baby kale, crispy prosciutto, and a poached egg. You can choose how the egg is cooked but I'm partial to poached. Service here is always good in my experience. It might not be the best place to take the parents as they can play music pretty loud but that doesn't bother me.",

Luckily, when I went by with a colleague on Friday morning, we just missed the rush; there was only a few minute wait to get seated at around 9:30am.  The name \"Snooze,\" may conjure up the image of someone sleeping in, but the staff at this place is high energy and full of smiles.  The hostess, server, and all of the staff we encountered were super friendly.  The atmosphere is bright and cheery -- clean too.  Our coffee and water were constantly being refilled and our food arrived pretty quickly after we ordered as well.  I had an omelette with egg whites, spinach, mushroom and jack cheese with tomatoes and multi-grain toast.  I know, I know... boring but healthy and made just right.  I was a happy camper.  My dining companion had the Upstream Benny.  We also shared a side of the signature \"Sweet Potato Pancake.\"  Mmmmmmmm - I highly recommend it!    I don't know that I'd go wait in line to eat at Snooze on the weekend, but I totally recommend it as a weekday option.  I noticed they have plenty of bar seating - a nice option for anyone that may be dining solo.  Seeing that this is their 9th location (they've got several in Colorado and California), I have a feeling this place will do just fine and I look forward to returning sometime soon!",

We came in waited 5 minutes and were seated.   30 minutes into the meal I notice all these people standing by the door, outside the door, around the door. Whoops we hurried and ate. There was a lot of peer pressure from those people waiting to hurry and eat. Needless to say get here before the 9am rush.   I still dream about their hash browns. They were crispy yet soft and flavor full yummy in my tummy. They're Bloody Mary was spot on too. If you glance to their bar you can see that they infuse their vodka right at home. Delicious and boozy!  I wanted to try their pancakes but pancakes and Bloody Mary yuck. So instead I had their pretzel breakfast sandwich which was quite delicious. My plate was wiped clean in 10 minutes or less. Which is not that healthy to eat that fast.",

    "text": "I frequent Snooze Town and Country once a week since they opened. The service has always been great until today. Food took over 40 minutes and the waitress Shelly disappeared the entire time not even filling our teas. I finally found her and asked why the entire patio received their food except me and I was there first. She checked in the back and told me they were out of poached eggs and it would be another 3-5 minutes. The food came out finally and it was delicious however we never saw Shelly again. I hope she splits tips with Charles because be picked up her slack big time. She finally dropped the bill and we asked for a refill which we never got. I decided to let the manager know so other guests dont have our experience and her response is \"she is trying and Snooze is a beast of a restaurant\". I guess maybe Shelly learned from the manager. I will take my business elsewhere.",

    "text": "I've been 3 times to this location.  The first two visits were fine, nothing to write home about.  It's a bit far from my home so I never made it a point to go here, but I needed to go to Nordstrom rack and I was a 1/2 hour early on their opening time so I went over to snooze to grab something to eat (solo with an infant in tow).  1. Service was fantastic.  Super friendly helpful staff. Got me a big comfortable table even though it was just me an a carseat with my baby.  My waitress was super friendly and chatty and another member of staff even stopped and chatted about my cute little bundle of joy.  In my opinion it's nice to go somewhere where the staff seems to enjoy their jobs and being at work and are engaging with the patrons that come in.  It definitely gives the place a positive vibe.  2.  I found my \"reason to come back over and over again\"!!! The chilaquiles Benedict was outta control delicious.  Apparently they make their barbacoa in house, which is amazing.  The time they take to stack the tortillas with the cheese in between each layer.  The very close to perfectly poached egg on top and the green chili hollandaise was sooo delicious I could have had a whole extra little ramekin of that on the side!  Only complaint was that the potatoes on the side were under seasoned (for me! Everyone is different mind you).  But honestly this Benedict was so good it didn't need a side of hashbrowns!   3.  Coffee is really good!  I've recently become kind of a coffee snob and their house blend is smooth and not bitter at all.  I added cream and stevia and I wish I hadn't added the stevia because it almost seemed like the coffee had so much great natural sweetness that the cream would have been a perfect duo with that simple yellow mug of brew.   All in all I had a very enjoyable breakfast! I will be back for that exact dish over and over again because I'm a creature of habit! ;)   Super yum!",

Let's start with the location itself. Extremely noisy, to the point where you can't hear the person in front of you.  The customer service was very good, as the staff was pretty friendly and courteous.   On to what I oredered. The OMG! French Toast was a big let down. They were supposed to be stuffed and I didn't really see it, unless that was the stuff melted into the syrup. Taste could of been better, nothing OMG about it. But, you could taste the coconut. I was told by the waitress that it was 2 stuffed french toast cut into quarters, but in reality was just 1 french toast cut into quarters. Hardly worth the $9.75 I was charged. Also the large orange juice was in a small glass. Are you guys going off European measurements? The only thing I actually enjoyed was the bacon, cause how can you really mess that up.  Well, this place is over hyped and the wait is just not worth the wait. I'd recommend going to Black Bear instead. They only get 3 out of 5 stars for the customer service and the bacon. But, I might just be feeling generous today.",

The previous time I came here, my niece ordered the hot chocolate and it was one my favorite hot chocolates I've had in a long time.

    "text": "I stumbled upon this place with a friend when we were on this side of town and glad that we did! It was about 110 degrees that day, so luckily we were able to be seated in an outdoor table right away. Otherwise, it would have been about a 45-50 minute wait. Although the heat made it a bit uncomfortable, the patio area is completely shaded so it wasn't too awful. Service was pretty prompt and prices were reasonable.   Judging from what other people were ordering, it seems like they're known for their pancakes. For those who can't decide which pancakes to get, you can pick 2 different ones with the same price and still be charged that same amount! My friend decided upon the sweet potato pancake and the pineapple upside down pancake. They were nice enough to put them on separate plates too so that you can taste each one individually. Both were really good, and the sweetness was not overdone with too much cream or syrup like in some other places. I ordered the Early Harvest Benny, which was delicious - egg was poached perfectly and I never knew pesto could go so well with Hollandaise sauce!  If I HAD to complain about something, the hash browns were just OK. My preference is having them a bit crisper on the outside. Having an outdoor cooling mist would have been nice too on a hot day. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal would would come back for sure. A lot of brunch places put emphasis on quantity over quality and it's nice to see there's one that doesn't make the same sacrifice! I'd give this a 4.5, but since there are no half stars on here, I'll give the benefit of the doubt and round up to a 5.",

Then we were paged to be seated and were required to stand there and wait watching our empty table wait for us for 5 minutes but they kindly informed us we could play with the dirty toys that have NEVER been washed outside....wait we just did that for 45 minutes!    OMG avoid the OMG French toast because the OMG you are expecting is more like OMG they just cut one large piece of bread into 4 pieces and OMG charge $10 and OMG I am going die of starvation.   Don't come thirsty either...waiting for a refill will take an entire meal. Perhaps because the concept of busboys is left to the servers and the hostess that is more than eager to pull your plate with food still on it!  Looking forward to the new locations in Tempe and Gilbert because this location leaves a lot to be desired. Hopefully the new places are arranged to handle the crowds with comfortable seating and staff trained to serve and move food, drinks and people. Otherwise they will be hearing from me there as well",

    "text": "Well, right from the start, the ONLY reason I did not give Snooze a 5 star rating is because or the wait, which was about 30 minutes longer that the hostess guesstimated.  The two of us sat at the bar for brunch yesterday, Sunday.  The attitudes and people skills of this place is off the chain, some of THE BEST that I have experienced.   So after sitting at the bar for maybe 3 minutes already with coffee in my hand, one of the bar tenders, Andy served the people next to us a cocktail and they RAVED about it, so I asked Andy what it was.  His answer while giving us the extra in the shaker to taste was \" a little morning Margarita.\"  My answer was that it could very easily turn into an all day BIGGGGG Margarita...soooooooooooooo good with the blood orange juice in it, yum!  We each ordered one. So for brunch we decided to get 3 plates and graze; Lynne ordered the pancake sampler, (gluten free), I ordered the corn beef hash with sunny side up and also the OMG stuffed french toast, also gluten free as Lynne does not eat gluten.  I had to taste the OMG stuffed french toast first.  I will admit that I was very unsure of what I was going to taste as most of the time when I do taste gluten free bread, it just does NOT appeal to me.  Let me tell you OMG OMG OMG...it was OMG!!!!  My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it.  I then tried mine, the corn beef hash.  I had it cooked crispy.  It was also off the chain, cooked perrrrrrrrfectly!  Next to get the pleasure of my fork was the pineapple pancake on Lynne's pancake sampler.  I have to say that after tasting all three plates, Snooze had a perfect score that day and we will be back very soon.  BTW, the ambiance was great.  The restaurant has great character and it is great for people watching there.  I want another one of those Margaritas!  Simply deeeeeeeeeeelicious!",

I went here for my first time last week and we were amazed.  Now, we did go here during off peak hours (9am on a Wednesday) but the restaurant was fairly full.    Service was ok, a bit on the slow side but she was great.  Remembered everything and provided good suggestions.   We got a 3 egg omelet with hash browns and a side of pancake (yes, I was hungry) and the breakfast tacos.  A pleasant surprise, but they also have a full coffee bar!  So we had to get a latte... better than the chain coffee joint I must say.  Everything was great.  The hash browns were a little soggy on the inside but crispy outside.  Buttermilk pancake.... excellent!  Omelet, light and fluffy... compliments to the cook.  Most breakfast places certainly do not make omelets like this.  The breakfast tacos were also great and you get to pick what you want in them.    All in all, not your normal breakfast place so any comparison to IHOP, Denny's etc do not make any sense.  This place is not like them so do not expect to see the Grand Slam for $5.  If you are looking for a moderately priced breakfast place close to Biltmore, the 51 or that is centrally located, this is it.  Be sure to get there at a reasonable time, it seems like this place would go on a wait quickly.",

The wait was very long (about 60 min), but they text you when your table is ready so we went to Nordstrom Rack for some shopping.  Not the place if you are in a hurry...but a great Sunday Brunch experience.",

There is a picture of the Reuben sandwich on this web page. but that's not what I got at all the meat that is in the picture is about 75% more than what I actually got. As I was walking out I saw there must have been 4 other people that ordered the same sandwich and all felt bad for them. Granted the sandwiches only about 10 bucks but I would have rather pay 15 for a lot more meat and then satisfied for what I paid for. I felt like the meal was really only worth about a $1.50. I really hope that they read the reviews and correct it as this is a popular sandwich. And I would have been a lot better with a lot more meat .",

    "text": "my little review. Upon entering I was pleasantly surprised at the decor, cool retro (not my fav style), but it impressed me. The waiter was wonderful and upbeat. Right there when we needed him. The hostess which was a guy (what's the name for him? A hoster?) was welcoming as well. Anyway, the booths were comfy and even liked the lighting. food was delish, we shared the breakfast pot pie, which was big enough for two. Very flavorful, the orange juice tasted fresh squeezed although a bit pricy at $4. The only complaint I have it the noise level was very high. They were busy but I've been elsewhere in the same situation and it's been much quieter. Maybe they need some buffer in the walls or ceiling to absorbs noise. Oh and one last cool thing. There's a bar across the front for looking out to the parking lot and the windows swing up and completely out of the way. Reminded me of Brophy's on the Harbor in Santa Barbara. I will be going back to explore more of their menu for sure.",

My husband ordered an omelet where he got to choose what he wanted in it. It was cooked to perfection...fluffy with lots of creamy cheese melted inside. The coffee was good as was the cappuccino.

(No, this is not a review for people who like healthier things on the menu.) I will say my girlfriend has gotten a few items from the 'Like A Feather' section and has always been happy.   I do recommend, to either get there before it opens, or call an order and pick it up. I have never come to this place without being packed, but regardless of how busy they get, our orders have never had a mistake.

    "text": "So, for my birthday, all I wanted was brunch and I've had my eye on snooze for quite some time now. There isn't one near me, so I hadn't tried it. We showed up around 8:30am on a Wednesday morning and I was surprised by how busy it was (good sign that it's a popular, tasty place). We got seated on the patio right away! We waited at our table, drooling over our menu for 20mins before my boyfriend grabbed a busser to let her know we hadn't been helped yet. She was so sweet and made sure we got helped. Our waitress didn't apologize for the wait or acknowledge how long we had waited, and took our order right away. We ordered a flight of pancakes and an eggs Benedict to split, as well as some Cafe Booze! The sweet busser came over to let us know that they were bringing us a flight of pancakes on the house. HOW SWEET. I didn't realize we would be getting TWO flights of pancakes! That's my favorite kind of surprise! Both my boyfriend and I agreed that the sweet potato pancake was our favorite, but they were all delicious. And the steak and egg Benny was undeniably the best eggs Benedict I've ever had.Our waitress had great customer service and even put something under our table so it would stop wobbling, even though we hadn't mentioned it! Overall, I was slightly frustrated to begin with, but the amazing service and to-die-for food made up for it all. Thank you Snooze for the most delightful brunch a food loving gal could ask for",

    "text": "Snooze sure doesn't make me snooze (and the bad jokes continue). I'll happily wake up earlier to beat the rush at Snooze for brunch, especially for their sweet potato pancakes and corned beef hash. What I love most about Snooze is their no hassle half-order policy; customers can pretty much request half orders on anything without worrying about ridiculously higher price points or messed up orders.   I love salty and sweet combinations, but I can rarely have the best of both worlds unless I dine out with a friend (and they're willing to share). Not so at Snooze! My favorite combination thus far is a half-order of corned beef hash and a half order of pancakes (one huge pancake). Oh did I mention Snooze's pancakes are the only ones I've ever liked? I'm usually a religious French toast follower, but the pancakes here are the perfect balance between fluffy and cakey. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the syrup, which I find really sweet and on the watery side, but I feel like the pancakes don't even need the syrup so it's not a big deal to me.  Service is always friendly and super laid back. Sometimes it takes a little bit of flagging during peak hours, but it's always greeted with a smile.   I haven't had a bad dish at Snooze, and some of my favorites are:  Pancakes pancakes pancakes: Snooze has a specialty pancake on rotation, and I've tried three different kinds so far and liked them all. Specials will be written at the front on a little blackboard, can be ordered within pancake flights, or can be ordered with a half order. Full orders are two huge pancakes, half order is one, and flights are three smaller-sized pancakes. So far my favorites have been chocolate chip, sweet potato, and a specialty one served with chocolate, almonds, and homemade creme anglaise. I've also enjoyed their plain, blueberry danish, and other specialty pancakes. The texture is really nice on these pancakes -- not too cakey, just be right amount of fluffy.  French toast: There are two kinds of french toast: neat and OMG. I think they're rather similar, with the OMG coming with more mascarpone cheese stuffed in the middle while the neat version has a little dollop on top. I find the neat to be more balanced and less heavy, especially when topped with fresh fruit that have thus far been strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries.   Corned beef hash: Seriously scrumptious corned beef hash with tender and flavorful corned beef, cohesive hash browns, and lovely flavoring. I substitute the toast out for more hash browns and mix it in. You can also ask for the hash browns to be extra crispy, although I like the original soft ones just fine.  Breakfast pie: I was curious as to what this actually was, and it turned out to be a flaky puff pastry doused in gravy with eggs and hash browns. The puff pastry was stellar, especially speaking as an amateur baker who has fumbled many times at making puff pastry. It was light and airy, with a  perfect crunch on the edges and a buttery flakiness in the middle. The gravy didn't mask the texture of the pastry, and it complemented the overall dish well. I was surprised by how much I liked this dish, and I'd order it again on a cheat day.  Benedicts: Snooze offers an interesting quinoa benedict with corn salsa. I thought the taste and textures were well thought out, but it took a little getting used to. The sharpness of the spice and creaminess of the egg and sauce complemented each other well. Regular eggs benedict was good as well, and eggs were poached perfectly each time.  Miscellaneous items: I've had a mocha here a couple of times, and it wasn't bad, but I'd probably opt for the plain coffee.  Hot chocolate comes with cinnamon and a heaping mound of whipped cream. Chicken sausage can be request a la carte, and I appreciate the non-red meat option. Extra crispy hash browns are smooshed down into flattened discs instead of the regular cupped kind and fried until they're crunchy on the outside.  Writing this review makes me hungry for Snooze, and chances are I'll be back this week.",

Our server was either new or just didn't give a rip about anything. Here we go.   I meet my buddy for breakfast and order the classic with poached eggs, ask for crispy bacon, and extra crispy hash-browns with a English muffin.   We get the food after quite a long wait but they were busy which is fine no issue there. This is where to me it fell apart.   The guy who dropped the food off asks \"is there anything else I can get for you?\" And I say, YES we need ketchup and hot sauce. He walks away and literally I'm waiting like an idiot for over 5 minutes when finally I get so annoyed I get up and take it from shelf myself.   I get jelly with my English muffin that is the size smaller than a quarter. Ummm it barely covered half of one slice. So our server doesn't check on us and I have to flag down another person to ask for more jelly. He doesn't fill our water and zero awareness of what's going on with his customers.   He randomly walk by and I still have food in front of me, he proceeds to grab the ketchup and hot sauce that I got myself and I almost half to yell at him to say I'm not done using it. I mean is he for real that he just takes the condiments while I'm still eating and clearly using them?  He comes by and finally asks if we want more water and anything else or the check. Bro learn how to interact with people and not just be an order taker. Service from today sucked. I still love the food but come on don't be that kind to basic things.",

When I came in they asked me how many people but it was just me & my lonely self. So they said I can get a table or booth but it would take about 15 mins. They also offered me a seat at the bar which I took cause there was seats available & you can choose where you want to sit.   I sat down and they gave me a menu and they ask for your drink. I just got water. I ordered the 3 egg omelette & you can choose what you want inside. I chose sausage, bacon, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, red peppers (they don't have green), spinach, onions & avocado. It comes with hash browns & your choice of bread (toast).   It was delicious! But I had no idea how much it would cost. It was about $20 ($19 & some change). It's about the same price I pay at ihop. Still trying to find a breakfast place where I don't have to pay for each ingredient. So far first watch is the winner but they don't have hash browns just potatoes.   They also have a patio outside. They have alcohol.",

The pancakes are really where it's at.  My wife loves the different eggs benedicts, and I think they're good, but it was a little too heavy for me.   My favorite thing are the blueberry lemon curd pancakes, hands down. So perfectly dense, sweet, and satisfying.  We also tried the fall seasonal pancakes with pumpkin and pecans (I think) - and HOLY CRAP, that maple butter was so delicious!   Come here with several people so y'all can share and try everything! It's a good time. And the service is good.   Explore the shopping center while you wait. Most stores are open by 10 or 11am, so you can browse clothes, groceries, stationary, etc while you wait the 30-45 min for your table.",

    "text": "Snooze has been a favorite brunch place of mine since I moved to Phoenix 1.5 years ago. The food is always delicious and I have loved every dish I've tried. My boyfriend loves sweet breakfasts and I love the savory options and there are always enough choices for the both of us. This time, we were seated and mind you a little hangry, and waited around 15 minutes before our server even approached our table for the first time. However, this was my only complaint and I suppose it was just a little mistake from a busy server. This time I ordered the chili verde Benedict with Barbados style beef (which I like better than the slow cooked pulled pork). The eggs were perfectly cooked and runny, the creamy green chili Hollandaise had a little bit of a kick, and instead of an English muffin, the bottom is made of green chili and tortillas!  My boyfriend ordered the pancakes of the day which were themed peppermint and chocolate (not quite sure of the official name). He loved his dish as well. While he wasn't the biggest fan of the peppermint marshmallows, the pancakes were fluffy and the chocolate sauce was delicious. It however would improve the dish just a little if they layered the chocolate sauce in between the pancakes as well as over the top!",

This place has great customer service and will bring you out food to the table just because your order might be taking longer than expected.    Their pancakes here are second to none.  Try the flight and you won't be mad about it in the least.    Their bloody mary's and cocktails are a perfect pairing for a lazy brunch and the delicious food doesn't hurt either.    Few things I'm deducting a star, they get a little fru fru with things they don't need to be, the hashbrowns are stamped out with a circular cutter (i mean honestly who needs this?) and one other thing.  They are on board with the whole paper straws movement.  I'm sorry but when I put a paper straw in a bloody mary and it get soggy and collapses within 15 minutes it completely ruins the experience.  Not to mention it tastes like you're sucking on dry cardboard which is never a fun taste.  Stop with the paper straws already.    Besides paper straws this place is legit and should be experience by anyone who enjoys some good breakfast food",

We're trying to go gluten-free, so besides ordering my favorite Breakfast Taco (tortilla with scrambled eggs, shredded hash browns, jack cheese, green chile hollandaise & pico de gallo), we decided to try a Sunburst Cake made gluten-free (buttermilk lemon poppyseed batter topped with homemade lemon anglaise, macerated blackberries, citrus mascarpone and toasted almonds).

The flavor was pretty good, but they were not fluffy buttermilk, yummy pancakes.  I know they have all the fancy options with a bunch of toppings, but if you can't get the plain ones to be outstanding, then you are not winning me over.  The hash brown cake.  It looked adorable, but I did not care for it.  I like my ratio of fried to not fried a little higher.  Soft in the the middle, not crispy.  Did not care for the flavor/seasoning on them either.  Just not my thing.  They did a nice job with customer service.  It was extremely busy and loud, but I expected that based on other reviews.  It's a cute place, but I think I will try other breakfast options that can make more impressive plain pancakes.",

The two eggs were on 3 inch pieces of bread and the hashbrowns served in this weird puck shape. The hashbrowns are delicious and I love the crispiness of it but the plate just looked so bare. I'm a person who eats with her eyes. I think it would do better if they added like a micro green salad on the side or something.

Neither of us had ever been here before but, it was on our list to try. So glad we did. The location is the old Soupor Salad which was there in Town and Country for many , many years. We were so sad when it closed. But, Snooze is all remodeled and cool and clean inside. The food was wonderful! very unique on a lot of items. I got an Eggs Benedict that I had never tried any where else. It was a Vegetarian version. On a bed of Grits rather than an English Muffin ,eggs,cooked just right. As well as the wonderful Hollandaise  sauce and some really great vegetables as well. The Hash Browns have been made in a form so they are nice and neat! Plus, the Coffee was wonderful. Not too strong and not weak either. The Ladies room was nice and clean with Dyson Hand dryers! Lots of parking in the lot as well.",

    "text": "Waited almost an hour for a table Sunday afternoon.  The restaurant is quite loud, and I found the music somewhat loud and rather grating (it's all top 50 female pop star music - Britney Spears and Company).  I don't see why they don't have seating on their patio, or why they have a ping pong table out there taking up valuable space.  I started with their $3.50 hot chocolate.  It was cinnamony, and the whipped cream definitely helped its richness.  I would have preferred it hotter and less syrupy, as it was slightly Hershey's chocolate milk flavored.  With bolder flavors (darker chocolate, more cinnamon) and a temperature increase it would be much better.  I tried the breakfast pot pie which consisted of a sheet of flakey pastry topped with cream gravy (no large sausage chunks despite what the waitress said) that included many large chunks of undercooked carrots, and an egg sunny side up.  I added on a side of chicken sausage ($3.75) which was not tasty - very bland and a little dry.  I should've gotten the chorizo.  The hashed brown potatoes were undercooked.  Everything was cooling off when it was served, rather than being steaming hot.  The food was fine, but I didn't appreciate the multitude of undercooked carrots at all.  The gravy could've used more sausage and spice/heat.  It was a good idea for a dish, but the components outside the egg and basic puff pastry crust didn't deliver.  Service was okay, though I didn't care for the waitress splitting the ticket down the middle, instead of breaking it into separate checks.  Parking was easy in front of Nordstrom Rack, which you can peruse while you wait for them to text you that your table is ready.  I'm glad I finally got to check this place out, but I don't see myself coming back, especially considering their prices.",

    "text": "I've been to Snore 5 times now, here in Phoenix.  Alright, it's \"Snooze\", not Snore.  But I don't like either names: because if I'm \"snoozing\", why, how would I be at breakfast?  In fact, I think \"BREAK-FAST! Is a better name than Snooze or Snore.  But I digress...my first visit was to a San Diego Snore location. and that visit was fast, friendly and delicious!   And accommodating, everything a great breakfast can and should be.  The last two visits were bad and I think they're moving in the wrong direction.  First of all, the servers are a whole bunch less friendly than the hostesses.  In fact, they're kinda aloof.    Worse is slow: last Sunday, I waited almost 25 minutes from order to delivery and everything on my plate was a different temperature: the toast was hot and delicious, the hash browns and eggs, cold...literally cold.  It was replaced and was delicious.  But I dunno, I think you gotta get that right the first time.    Today, I met a friend, she clearly ordered Corned Beef Hash with scrambled eggs and a pancake.  The eggs and pancake showed up alright and the Corned Beef Hash followed a good 12 minutes later.  Now, I'm not going to pay $15 - each - for breakfast, featuring poorly prepared food with slow, aloof server/service, (who today was not aloof, but was not really in-tune with waiting tables)...and a smiling hostess.  Not worth it.  Last, someone also pointed out something to me that made me take notice: you know how long-time breakfast joints, IHOP, Denny's, Village Inn, they always SMELL like a breakfast joint?  I don't know if it's 15 years of bacon grease, but they DO have that \"breakfasty\" smell, and...well...you don't get any of those aromas at Snooze. Why is that?  No breakfast aroma.",

The ambiance is welcoming and bright with large open windows that nicely blend the outdoors with the indoors. The servers were friendly and the food was great. I've listed some pros and cons below. Overall we were very satisfied.   Pros: *Ambiance - Cool retro Jetsons  -like theme.   *Could get coffee and specialty drinks from the bar while waiting to be seated. *Gluten free pancakes for adults and kids and the kids plates were completely polished off because they loved them so much.  *Excellent fluffy and tasty pancakes.  *3rd Street Chai (aka their Honey Vanilla sweet chai) was really good...so good my wife ordered a second one.  *Orange juice was fresh and delicious.  *Pineapple upside down pancake was great.  *Balloon animals for the kids on this Sunday morning made smiles and gave us something for the kids to take home.  *Friendly servers.   Cons: *Music in restaurant a little too loud for normal conversation and made it hard to hear the server.  *Table Turn Times slow. Many tables were empty for up to 5 minutes waiting to be bussed after a party left. Of course, when you're starving, even a few minutes seems like forever.  *Not enough sauce initially on my Strawberry Rhubarb pancakes.  *The strawberry rhubarb pancake only came with a blended sauce and no real strawberries.   Go and enjoy!",

I got a benedict that had mexican flavors to it. It was really good and the egg was cooked to perfection! The yolk was just cooked enough where the yolk was still gooey (just the way I like it!). However, it is not the best benedict I ever had.   I believe you can 'create your own pancake' too. I would definitely go here again when I'm in town, but I won't drive all the way over here just to eat (I live 40 minutes away). Next time, I will be trying the pancakes.",

It has made all other breakfast places seem dismal. The quality of food is astounding, the atmosphere is upbeat and trendy and the servers are the friendliest, hippest people you will ever meet. You will never wait less tan an hour for a table, but the wait has always been worth it.  Snooze Phoenix is no different. They have captured the essence of the hipster vibe of Denver and brought it to the valley quite nicely.  The food, again will never disappoint. If you've never been, here are my suggestions:  Always ask what the pancake of the day is. Always.  Sweet: Pancake Flight with a Pineapple Upside Down Pancake, the Pancake of the Day and a Cinnamon Roll pancake.  Savory: 3 Egg Scramble with hollandaise, avocado and pico de gallo and corn tortillas.  There is nothing but love in my heart for Snooze. Now, Snooze, please get your booties out to Orange County next!!!",

    "text": "Went to Snooze for the first time the other day.  I really like the decor in the place.  It is cute a place.  When we came in the were just 2 of us and we were greeted right away.  There were quite a few tables open and the hostess sat us a really large center table.  It was way too big for two people.  I guess we should have just asked for a different table.  Our waitress took our order and she was nice but definitely over friendly in any way.  I ordered the breakfast pot pie with a side of sausage.  The meal came in an acceptable time and the pot pie was just as described other than the fact the gravy had barely any sausage in it.  The extra sausage I ordered was one very small patty.  The pot pie was extremely bland.  Just lacking in flavor.  The sausage I ordered was what I thought was going to be 1.75 extra.  When we got the bill we were charged 3.75 extra.  Now on the menu there is a spot on the left that says extras or something to the that effect. It is located right below the area I ordered from. I thought that meant if you wanted a piece of sausage or some bacon it would only be 1.75.   I ended up getting the waitress's attention and asked by I was being charged so much for a tiny piece of sausage.  She explained the extra full pieces of sausage and bacon you order are on an entire other area of the menu.  The 1.75 option is just a few crumbles extra on your meal.  I explained how misleading that was and overpriced it was and she agreed.  She did get the manager to adjust the price.  I just do not feel the food was good enough to justify the price.  If you want breakfast that tastes better and way less money there are about 20 options within 2 miles of this place.  I doubt I will ever go back.",

This is probably the most poorly managed restaurant I have been to in years. Put your name down and go have breakfast somewhere else. By the time your name is called it should be time for lunch. After years in the industry restaurants are all about the experience and less about the food. The food was good here for the most part aside from the hash browns. For a larger sized restaurant serving breakfast food I do not understand how on earth anyone would have to wait any longer than 40 minutes, but this seems standard to Snooze. I guess if you have a half a day to spend and your bored it's a great place for people watching and you will get to eat eventually. I won't be back again.",

OMG French toast was amazing covered with strawberries and toasted coconut with cream and caramel sauce. I live they offer the pancake flight because they have so many yummy sounding pancakes it would be to hard to choose just one to try. The flight let's you choose 3 flavors. Definitely will be back need to try out the rest of the menu. We sat outside on the patio which was nice and they have heaters that you can have them turn on. Inside looks warm and inviting too.",

My group of friends and I had just come in as the rush was dying down, so after waiting about forty minutes to get seated we were starving. I'm a huge coffee drinker, so I got the iced coffee. Very good taste overall. I had been craving potatoes, so I got the dish on the menu that was literally a bowl of hash browns and you could put anything into it. When I got my meal, it was a nice portion, but it was very bland. It wouldn't have been much trouble to salt the potatoes before putting them in the bowl. Really wish I would have gotten the eggs benedict instead.  Overall, it was okay, but I wouldn't drive the thirty minutes it took me to go there again.",

There was a friendly manager that walked throughout the restaurants to make sure each diner were enjoying not only the food but the dining experience.  The retro vibe was super fun!  We ordered the pancake trio (upside-down-pineapple, sweet potato & apple pie) and eggs benedict.  They let us order 1/2 Benny Goodman - smoked salmon & 1/2 Harvest - hearty greens & mushroom.  We felt like we had 5 different dishes.  The food was delicious with great fresh ingredients.  You definitely have to try their pancake of the day.  It's a new flaver every day, and they never repeat it.  Get there early on weekends, but it is worth the wait!",

    "text": "I was back at Snooze this morning. I usually make it here for breakfast every month or so, and the food/service is almost always great. This morning was a different story. I arrived around 8:45 and there was no wait for a table.. Lucky me ! !   I quickly was sat at a little two top table near the back. I had an idea of what I wanted, but always like to hear about the pancake of the day before finalizing my order. I sat and waited, and waited and waited. A busgirl was busy cleaning off tables around me, but no sign of a waitress. Finally, after 5 minutes, a waitress peers over the half wall and sees me sitting there. She comes over and asks if I would like something to drink. No apology for the delay or anything.. No mention of a daily special pancake. Just your very standard order taker..   I decide to try the OMG french toast with a side of ham. I had heard great things about the french toast and have never had it before. The food arrives before too long. The side of ham was actually two small pieces--one about an inch by 2 inches, and the other piece 2 inches square.. WTF? The french toast was promised to have fresh strawberries and coconut. A more appropriate description would be one strawberry cut in about 8 tiny pieces. It was supposed to be stuffed with mascarpone cheese. If there was at one time some mascarpone in between the brioche slices, it must have been spread on with a butter spreader because there was nothing between the bread slices resembling a creamy cheese. The flavor was good, but it definitely reads better on the menu that it was presented to me today. If what I got today was the spec for it and not a shorted version, maybe they should change the name from OMG french toast to Ehhhh French toast..  I will go back based on previous visits, but if this was my one and only trip, it would have been my last.",

I gave it to them and instantly got an email telling me that I would get another text when my table is ready.  A quick 15 minutes later, the four of us sat.  So many good choices!  I had the pancake flight with my choice of any three of their pancake flavors!  All three were great!  I had chocolate batter with strawberries, blueberry pancakes, and pineapple upside down!   the coffee was also good.  the others with me enjoyed theirs also.  One commented how much they like the weight of the silverware!  don't you hate when the fork weighs less then plastic ware--not here!  My wife said the bathroom was clean but a bit small.  Anyway, this is the first location in AZ.  I will be back, and I. Highly recommend it if you are nearby.  We drove from ahwatukee and it was worth the drive!  The general manager came from Paradise bakery, and knows how to please guests!  I would have bought a hat or tshirt as a souvenir, but did not see them displayed anywhere!  Oh well, maybe next time!  Snooze AM Eatery!  Only open until 2:30, so enjoy a hearty breakfast!",

Was very crowded, but didn't have to wait very long. Like some of the other reviewers, we immediately noticed how loud the music was. We were seated next to each other at the counter, still had difficulty carrying on a conversation. Ordered the Gazpacho Bloody Mary and a Melon Mimosa. Both were average. My friend ordered the French toast, side of hash browns, side of bacon. I had the blueberry pancake, side of hash browns, side of bacon.  The food is okay, neither of us were overly impressed. The bacon has a great flavor, but extremely greasy. I can't say that anything stood out as spectacular. I definitely expected an experience that stood out. Just a bit disappointed.",

We all ordered seperate plates of different choices. All were great! To top it off we shared the caramel apple pancakes!!! What a pleasant surprise these were.

When I brought this to the server's attention, she attempted to suggest my food was cold due to the hollandaise sauce on my poached eggs, explaining  the sauce should be cold. Nice try but the entire plate of food was cold. And in terms of flavor and distinction, everything was bland. Though my food was replaced with warmer food, no one bothered to deduct the cost. It seems the restaurant spends a lot of energy on appearance and marketing but more energy needs to be spent on timely delivery of warm food that lives up to the hype--particularly when a breakfast tab runs nearly $50 for two people. And the noise is this place is deafening!! Forget about having a conversation. Horrible acoustics made worse by music that is set on the loudest level, to, apparently, cover up the noise of the crowd. Wouldn't return. Go to Matt's Big Breakfast instead.",

After waiting 10 minutes to be greeted by a server that looked mildly annoyed she had an opportunity to make money while at her job... I ordered a coffee, my husband ordered a pineapple juice. The juice never came. We ordered breakfast.. Maybe the juice was being fresh squeezed? My husband ordered pancakes, I ordered the chilaquiles benedict. The pancakes came out like pancakes... The Benedict looked like everything my breakfast loving heart desired. The first bite was cold... I assessed it to be the mass amount of pico piled on top. A few more bites... Meh. Tried the other half without all the pico... ICE COLD meat. Appetite killed with the fear that Id be yacking up food poisoning later. After our server finally showed up.. Still no pineapple juice.... I informed her of the ice cold meat (Cold as if they took it out of the freezer, forgot to prep it and just piled it on top). She asked if I wanted another one. I declined saying I didn't have time to wait for another meal as my husband was already finished with his breakfast and it was a weekday. She said she would take it off the bill. I handed her my credit card to go ahead and run since everything seemed to take forever there. She brings it back... The manager took $5 off. The Benedict was $13.50. The manager also never even came to the table. I want to hate this place and never return, but I know there is so much potential on that menu. The sad part is the owner was sitting at the table next to usgoing over paperwork.... Oh well.",

The place is new, aesthetically pleasing and staffed by well-trained people who are pleasant, attentive and friendly.  The trendy decor, however, has nothing to absorb the noise so with the music a bit too loud, the voices are elevated as well and the overall noise level is just too much.  If the food wasn't exceptional, I would write this one off my list.  Maybe a weekday would be better if there are fewer diners!",

We asked one of the servers to lower the level which they were most happy to do so.  Now....to the food!  I had the breakfast burrito.  I think one of these would be enough for THREE people.  It was huge!  Enough for breakfast for the next two days.  The wait staff were very attentive, refilling our coffee numerous times.  I was impressed that the food runner came out with our plates and without asking, placed all the orders correctly.  No asking who gets this.  Will definitely go back again!",

The manager on duty was outgoing and friendly.  Unfortunately, today was the total opposite.  The waiter/bartender was nice and friendly.  That's were the good times stopped.  I guess the cook(s) were ready to call it a day.  I had a simple order....french toast, 2 eggs over medium, and bacon.  The french toast was just toast with powder sugar sprinkled on top.  I can't believe the cook tried to pass this off as french toast.  I think the bartender was embarrassed.  She quickly returned it for me.  The bacon was badly under cooked.  I returned that item, too.  It came back over cooked.  I would have been embarrassed to serve this meal at home much less serve it to a paying customer.  It will be awhile before I return to Snooze.  I work in the area and there are too many options to have to settle for this.  Thankfully, the waiter/bartender was very pleasant.",

The menu is great and there are plenty of unique items to choose from in addition to \"regular\" options. The food took a little while to arrive, but looked great when it did. I ordered the pea polenta cakes with hollandaise and my son ordered the french toast off the kids menu. Both of our orders tasted good, but were served luke-warm. The hashbrowns were not crispy and were served as if they had been popped out of muffin cups. Flavor good, temperature of food-not. I would have sent the food back, but it took a while to receive it and our waitress did not check in with us right away.

My daughter had chocolate chip pancakes and ate every bite. I had the chilaquiles benedict. It was so flavorful and the egg was perfect and runny. It sits on top of corn tortillas and is topped with a cotija cheese hollandaise sauce. It was simply magical. A MUST try.   Our sever, Desiree, was very nice and attentive. She also said that's her favorite Benedict on the menu.   Try it, they won't disappoint you.",

It's usually a little harder for me to put food down when I am. But boy, I demolished my food. This place, I know I say it often, but I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it. This place is life changing.   I was stuck between two Benedicts and our server let me know I could just do half and half since it comes with two. Thanks homie. I got the Benny Goodman and the Winter Harvest. Nice! Both eggs were perfectly poached. Nice little bounce to the egg feeing like a custard or jello. The chef probably went through a 50 year course on how to poach eggs. Both had a cream cheese hollandaise which was surprisingly good. Nice little tang with a kiss of the sweetness from the cream cheese. It had a really bright taste. Probably a little bit of lemon juice so you don't get that eggy taste to the hollandaise.  Winter harvest had a nice sweet potato polenta topped with a few more veggie/healthy/earth ingredients. Honestly with that perfectly poached egg and sweet tangy hollandaise. You couldn't tell you were being healthy and enjoying the bountiful harvest from Mother Nature.   Now. My favorite Benny. Yo!!! Homie! I'll tell you this. I love Lox. So I'm biased on this. Having a Lox Benedict! You win me over. Everything was nice. Salmon was smokey not too fishy. Everything had a nice ratio. The best Benedict I've ever eaten. I hate rye bread. I loved having rye on this.   We got a flight of pancakes. Which is you get to choose 3 flavors. For $9? I forgot what we ordered since I don't really like pancakes. But they were all pretty good for pancakes.   What I do remember out of the pancakes was a the cinnamon bacon one. Bacon is good. Bacon makes everything good. If you're into pancakes. Do this one.   Coffee is okay.   Bloody Marys were good. We had the Bangkok one. Fishsauce, lime, cilantro, sriracha.   We were the only Asians in the restaurant at the time. Maybe in all of Arizona. Our server brought us sriracha as our hot sauce when all the other tables had Tabasco. Funny. He was a cool dude though.   If this was down the street from me. I'd wake up every morning feeling like I won the lotto.",

The sweet potato was the best, followed by the pineapple upside down version and then the choc. chip variety. I also added a pretty tasty mocha at $3.50. The pancakes all had an unusual butter variety on each flavor which also upgraded these hotcakes to the next level.    We only waited about 12 minutes on a Saturday AM and they have free coffee to drink during your wait. We snagged a nice table outside before the heat kicked in and there is a reason this place is popular - it's good. This is another chain though, but in the end, as long as the food makes me happy, it doesn't matter chain or not.",

We came by right after church so about 1 o'clock and it was very busy which we already assumed it would be. The wait was about 15 minutes but we are patient people. We were seated outside on the beautiful patio and our waiter, Jeff, was so helpful and courteous to us. He gave us a recommendation on the food and took care of us the whole time (wasn't too hung over us but didn't ignore our presence either). This place is definitely my boyfriend and I's new place to go after church, they close at 2:30 so definitely take advantage of the time. The food is AMAZING! Some of the best eggs ever and I don't even like eggs that much!! My boyfriend had the Gritz and Shrimp, the gritz taste like southern style gritz which we LOVED! Everything was fantastic!!",

They had the windows open all around the restaurant which was perfect the morning we visited.  We arrived and were told we'd have to wait 20minutes. We asked to wait at the bar so we could rehydrate after a late evening exploring the Pheonix night life. The hostesses were kind and said we could hang out on the side without a problem. Our service at the bar was excellent too. Each server came over to us to ensure that we had ordered. I got the sweet and spicy chai teas blended together after a recommendation from our server. It was delicious and helped hold me over until my meal. My husband got some tea and was happy that it was loose leaf.   We were sat 20 minutes later and ordered. I had my go-to, the upper east sider which is spinach, artesian bread, smoked salmon, goat cheese with herbs and capers with sun dried tomatoes. It was delicious. My husband got a build your own omelette with green chillies on top. His was also really tasty and he was very happy with his selection. We did share the peanut butter and chocolate chip pancake which we didn't really care for. The cinnamon bun one is what we usually go with and regretted not getting it this time. Fortunately we had another chance the next morning to make up for it. Great spot and great service are always consistent here!",

But, I guess that just shows how good the food is. Also, a huge disappointment for me is their coffee! How can you have such delicious food and such terrible coffee?

    "text": "So as a first timer im a little disappointed. I got the breakfast pot pie with the egg on top and a side of bacon. The bacon was so rock solid with no flavor. Plus i got just bits and pieces of the bacon not a full slice. 3$ for that?!  I guess i came in to late that they couldnt cook it fresh? Not sure. The hash browns were pretty good and the pot pie was good. I asked for hot sauce and the guy brings me a empty bottle? I let him know and he never came by to give me a new one. I also never got a refill on my drink after asking twice. I guess i just have terrible luck with that, seems every resturant they forget.  The service was alright. I dont think ill be back though. Really was looking forward to this place sucks how it turned out.. i wanted to order pancakes to go because they sounded so good, but i passed and kinda glad i did.. I dont think ill ever be back sadly... Also the music is really a bit much for kids. Maybe it was just the wrong time of day but not a place to bring kids. The music says bitch, motherfucker, hoe, pussy, dick, sex things of that nature. Not something a kid should be hearing. Not that i have an issue but if your looking to bring your kids, beware.",

You get two bennys and hash browns per order. The portions look small when the plates arrive, but they will definitely fill you up.  Granted, my friend and I also got a plate of pancakes to share along with his own entree. And our mimosas. And beermosas (With FRESH OJ, mind you. I loathe minute maid and concentrate junk). But it's ok because their prices aren't outrageous like some other bfast spots so you can go ahead and order whatever the heck you want. The spuds were great although a little carb heavy. The pancakes have a nice crispy exterior and a smooth fluffy interior. This probably will be my go-to breakfast joint!  Food is definitely worth the wait. Just anticipate that when timing your arrival and estimated eat time. Plus there's nordstrom rack, trader joes, and whole foods for you to peruse while waiting for the text saying your table is almost ready.",

I had just an original mimosa w/oj but they offer many other juices to mix.  For my entree, I opted for the Snooze Spuds Deluxe: A heaping portion of our hash browns, covered with melted cheddar & jack cheese, scallions plus two veggies , meats, or combo of your choice. (taken directly from their menu) So good and our service was fantastic.   I would eat here every morning if I could!",

So, my wife was stoked when I surprised her and our girls with a visit to their new location in Phoenix.  She actually hit me and gave me an arm hug.  It's everything I remember... minus the big mural outside.  Snooze is fun, quick (apart from the lines), and high-energy.  The staff is always pleasant while orders hit your table without a lot of waiting, making it easy with kids.  The pancake, waffle, and french toast options are always worth blowing your diet on.  I really enjoy their breakfast tacos with chorizo and a dousing of Tapatio.  Definitely a place to take your spouse and/or family for an enjoyable start to the day.  And the balloon guys was really good with our daughter.  She loves her mermaid.",

Yes, the decor is cute, but the food does not match up--at least not what I got.   Our server was really nice and enthusiastic about the food. Because it was our first time there, he brought us his favorite pancake--on the house. I believe it was a pineapple upside down pancake. Unfortunately, we ordered before I was able to taste the pancake. I do not like the syrup they use here. It has an odd flavor that I'm not used to and that doesn't taste like maple syrup (and yes, I've had real maple syrup before). So, my french toast was not good, in my opinion, because of the syrup. But I got the french toast because it sounded good and it came highly recommended.  My husband got Juan's Breakfast Tacos, and I liked that much better. Perhaps other dishes are better, but I'd venture out to try another place before I tried this place again.",

I subbed my toast for a blueberry Danish omelet for $3.50. Great choice though!! The hash browns were awesome!! The kids meals are great as well and only $6.00.

Pancakes were amazing, and they offer a flight of pancakes so you can taste 3 of the different types so you don't have to choose just one of the delectable pancakes offered.

Read lots of reviews about bad service but they seem to have fixed that issue. Our server promptly greeted us, offering menus and drinks.   After we all arrived, our server offered to answer any questions about the menu. She took our orders, which were: Breakfast Pot Pie, Juan's Breakfast Taco trio, Snooze Spuds Deluxe (2), Breakfast Burrito and Ham Benedict III.   They all looked and smelled wonderful. My Benedict was excellent: toasty English muffin, lots of chopped ham, poached egg and cheesy hollandaise sauce. It also came with hash browns. I asked for them crispy and they were perfect.   The hollandaise was lacking the tang of lemon but was much more savory than normal.   During our meal, a balloon-animal dude was cruising the place, keeping the kids happy.   Give Snooze a try but plan on a wait. There are some shops nearby, which help pass the wait time.",

    "text": "This is my husband and I's favorite breakfast place we have tried in a long time. We arrived on a Sunday morning around 9am. Quoted a 30 minute wait for 2 adults and a highchair. Our wait was exactly what we were told. Nice waitress and discussed that they can help customize your breakfast even if you want half of one of their dishes. The food was SO good. I ended up getting two Juan's tacos and a small side of the pineapple upside down pancakes. I was expecting a little more sauce/pineapple on the pancakes but everything was delicious. My only suggestion would be to make them easier to find on the internet. I always forget the name of this restaurant and it is VERY hard to try to locate in the internet search.  Definitely worth the wait.",

I ordered the Chili Verde Benny and my husband got the Corned Beef Hash. The Corned Beef Hash was a huge disappointment so I ended up giving my husband half my Benny. The Benny was good but NO part of our meal was worth the 1 hr and 15 min wait.",

We chose to wait for a table outs to dine, which usually takes longer than inside. Wouldn't want to sit inside tho, kinda squished and loud. Friendly hostesses, our server was very nice, obviously busy, but not great as a server. Food is definitely not what we expected. I ordered the Pancake Flight,... pancakes were dry & tasteless, needed more of the \"fillings/toppings, just to try to eat them.  My husband ordered an omelet that had jam, sausage, and cheese in it. The sausage had a weird taste, ham was good, and so were the hash browns.  We aren't going back, rather spend $30 somewhere else for a better meal.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I gave Snooze a shot this morning. We decided to eat at the bar, which was a great choice because the bartender was insanely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu items. My boyfriend ordered the Neat French Toast, which he scarfed down happily. I ordered a soy latte and the Late Harvest Benny. WOW. The benedict was nontraditional with polenta as the base rather than an english muffin. It had creamy hollandaise, swiss chard, goat cheese, and pine nut bread crumbs sprinkled on top. When I gave my boyfriend a bite of it, he thought it was so tasty that he ate half of my meal because he couldn't put his fork down!   It's rare to find a breakfast joint with good food and good service, so we were pleasantly surprised to see top-notch service and delicious food at Snooze.  The most wonderful thing about this restaurant is the QUALITY of the food. All of the meats are free-range, the eggs are cage-free, the coffee is through a partnership, the chai (Bhakti) is from Colorado, and the beers are local craft brews. They even have nontraditional quality liquors, and hot sauce from Colorado, too. Again, it's rare to find a restaurant that cares about the source of its food, so I love that Snooze is eco-friendly and environmentally conscious.  We will definitely be back for more!",

Juan's street tacos with poblano hollandaise sauce have great flavor without being spicy. Another good choice is the spuds deluxe, which is is mound of hash browns covered with cheese and a choice of two fillings. The pork belly bacon is really good as well. We sampled a salted caramel white chocolate chip pancake too and it was rich and sweet, but tasty as a dessert. We love breakfast places that have espresso machines and a bar - this one didn't disappoint. Can't wait for the Gilbert location to open!",

Being a vegan, I loved that they had options to make my breakfast without meat/dairy. While my husband loved that he could have whatever his meatlover heart desired. I have had the tofu scramble with the soyrizo which is delicious! My husband loves the sausage. The pancake of the day when we were there the first time was a sticky bun pancake, we ordered one for the table as dessert and I had a couple bites, it was heaven!   There is usually a wait, even during the week. But they will text you when your table is ready and you can go shopping at Nordstrom Rack right next door or take advantage of the games they have on their patio. They also have Bloody Mary's and mimosas, and great coffee. I know I'll be back! I love a good breakfast spot!",

We tried a pancake flight with the sweet potato, blueberry danish, and the swamp monster (Pancake of the Day). Then we did a combo order of the chilaquile and havana benedicts. I haven't eaten this much food in a long time, and it was all fantastic.  Elise was our server, and took just superb care of us, including answering my usual string of stupid questions about a new place and its food. Apparently the little \"sparkles\" that decorate everything there are called a \"compass\" and each letter stands for a different thing.   Even the mugs and flatware are quirky, and we loved it all. We will definitely be back when we finish digesting the breakfast we ate this morning... so maybe three months or so. Ooof!",

We visited on a Monday morning for breakfast and were greeted by an almost full restaurant. Finding a spot at the bar we were quickly welcomed by a friendly staff and provided good coffee and a selection of tea.  The menu has some standards, but we were recommended to try their special focus - Benedict.  I thoroughly enjoyed my blend of two different dishes  - one was a barbacoa and the other was a mushroom and asparagus. Outstanding.  Important to note is that they are willing to accept special requests. Need a half sized portion? No problem. Want to try a split dish? Do it. Have an original idea for a dish? Bring it on.  They are also a brunch place with great options for adult beverages, including Bloody Marys, Beer and Wine on Tap.  So, do yourself a favor, bust in on the locals hiding place and enjoy some great food and a cool dining experience.",

    "text": "I'd heard about this restaurant and it's reputation in the mountains.  So when the family all woke up on new year's day, the youngest brother made us all trek down (from the North Valley) to Town & Country's new Snooze.  We were told 30-45 min wait and offered coffee while we waited.  We drank the coffee.  We got bored.  We wandered into Nordstrom Rack.  We tried on clothes,  We shopped,  We bought clothes.  An hour after our initial arrival... we get the text!  We were told a few minutes, you're next, just clearing a table.  10 minutes later, still waiting.  Several tables not being cleared.  Some tables get cleared!  We don't get seated.  Another 10 minutes later, we are seated.  The hostesses did not inspire confidence.  And it shouldn't take any restaurant 10 minutes to clear a table.  Our waitress is lovely.  She's knowledgeable and capable.  I like her.  She explains our options, gives us suggestions, etc.  I do the half benny as does a sister in law.  Many do pancakes, we have a burrito as well, a few pretzel sandwiches and pancakes on the side.  Coffee is good; I ordered grapefruit juice that was very delicious.  Food takes a while, they're clearly attempting to get the hang of things. Food arrives.  I like the classic benny half but not the mexican version (it's bland).  SIL doesn't like her mexican benny either, but the havana is deemed delicious.  Pancakes are fairly well received though husband and myself think they're too dry and kind of crunchy.  Husband also had Sam I Am sandwich and wasn't a fan.  I would go back to Snooze for the benedicts and the juice.  I think it has potential but it really needs to figure out it's service model and get people moving through faster.  In the meantime, I can have a similar or better brunch faster at other places.  Prices are pretty fair though.  Brunch for 6 split 3 ways as 31 (w/o tip for 2 people).",

This works better than the buzzer system because it give us range to explore Town & Contry Shopping Center.  I settled on the tasty Breakfast Pot Pie with a cup-shape of hash browns.  Yes, a cup   Every other hash brown I had was low and float like a pancake.  Snooze's hash brown was in the shape of a small bowl.  Whatever the shape, it was good!    Snooze is busy, slow (in service)  and loud.    Still, I like this place.   They have a number of menu items I would like to try when I return.  To get to five stars, tighten up the service (which was slow) and find a way to lighten up on the noise and we got something pretty special here.",

We LOVED our food....tacos, pot pie, and blueberry pancakes.   There wasn't a crumb left.   However the disappointing part were the drinks.  I ordered a bloody marry. And he order mm mm mimosa.   And we basically got oj and Tomato juice w a kick.  There was zero alcohol in either.   Somewhere with such great food should do better w their drinks.  Service was ok.  Not great. Not bad.  He was attentive after he finally greeted us.  Very sweet and a nice guy.  But when we told him the drinks were no good.  He made a joke and that was it.      I will def go back Bc food is amazing.  But I won't waste money on cocktails probably",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this place for sooooo long. Just needed someone to get up early on a Sunday and come with! It was after noon when we arrived (Sorry, I hate mornings!) and it was quite busy but there is a lot of seating so the wait time was expected to be only 20-30 minutes. We opted to sit at the bar instead where you can select off their Breakfast Cocktail menu (whaaaaa???) and enjoy dining there instead of having to wait. The morning cocktails are nothing less of fabulous. Traditional mimosas OR, one's with pineapple juice, or with tequila instead of OJ and then each one has a little special twist to it. Ours were very blah and mostly just juice so I asked the bartender to add more alcohol. She did so that was nice. Her service unfortunately was not so hot. She just seemed like she didn't want to be there and that we were just a nusiance to her for the most part. We had to remind her and wait quite a while to get water that we asked for and to place an order. I would have rated it higher based on the food and drinks but the service was just less than mediocre. So then I go right to, well I can just go to TC Eggington's or BLD for great food and at least the service is typically friendlier. I would probably go again if in that area but I can't see going out of my way. The breakfast menu itsef was pretty impressive and I went with the OMG french toast but it didn't blow me away. Not quite as much flavor and sweetness I was expecting but still a very nice dish. He ordered the Benny Goodman which was an open faced breakfast sandwich with poached egg and salmon and asked for sauces/accompaniments on the side. Not something I would ever want to have but he seemed to like it. It's a nice place. Great area. You can browse around the Rack or hop over to Biltmore to shop after. But I am big on being treated like you want me there and want me to come back and they, I can honestly say, did not!",

Even then, we did wait quite a bit for the food, plus some of our orders were messed... but, all was made up when we weren't charged for the mistakes PLUS a  $25 gift card!! All was made right! Pancakes were delish!!  Second time we went during the week for a brunch/lunch, with no wait. And friendly service.  Eggs benedict were ahhmazing!  Check it out, but be prepared for the wait on weekends!",

I'm not giving it 5 stars because I didn't have anything I couldn't live without, but I would definitely recommend it and will go again. Liked the Bella Bella Benedict and the sausage gravy best but everything was good. Subbed a pineapple upside down pancake for toast on one meal and 4 of us shared it as a dessert. Couldn't imagine eating more than that - it's great, but a lot of sugar. Bloody Mary's were ok. Oregano's and Carly's still have the best of those in the valley.   You're going to have at least a 30 min wait and maybe closer to an hour or more depending on when you go, so go shopping at My Sisters Closet and they will text you when it's time to head back over. It's a nice feature since they don't take phone reservations.",

We tried to go one weekend, but the wait was too long. So, we ended up going on a Thursday. We waited a bit, but I think that's really a testament to the food.  I ordered the corned beef hash. And guys, it's real corned beef! Not out of a can, like at most places. It had a crisp to it and it was so delicious.   My boyfriend loves it because just about everything on the menu can be made gluten-free.   The waitress treated us to a pineapple upside down pancake (gluten-free) and wow. It was amazing.  I can't wait to come back here. Yes, there is a wait and I'd stay away from this place on the weekends. But make time one week day morning. You won't regret it.",

So we started with the peach bellinis and we weren't too thrilled with those, due to the heavy presence of basil. I ordered the pineapple upside down pancakes, sausage, and eggs scrambled with cheese. My friend ordered the basic French toast, as well as a breakfast taco. The food was amazing the pancakes were delicious and the sausage patty was the best I've  ever had. My friend devoured everything while my meal could honestly feed two, so of course I couldn't eat it all! I can't wait to visit this place over and over again to try everything on the menu.",

I was so excited to learn that they were coming to Phoenix (and appear to be planning on opening another location in the Valley as well). Finally got to go today and was not disappointed!  As others have mentioned, you can get half orders of meals in order to try a couple different things. I think that's pretty amazing in itself. Their pancakes are creative and incredible. Today's pancake of the day was white chocolate cherry and oh my lord, it was sensational. If you order food that isn't pancakes, you can also order a small pancake of your choice to have on the side so as to sample it without ordering a huge one.  The staff was genuine and appreciative of our business. The waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to answer every question we had. She had informed the manager that we had been to the Denver location and the manager came over to welcome us and chat a bit. We felt like VIP's during our very first trip to this location!  I honestly can't recommend this place enough. I missed it so much after moving back from Denver and I can honestly say that I'll be a regular at Snooze. I'm going to bring as many people as I can too. Everyone should experience this place.",

    "text": "Went an a Sunday at 10:30am We had a large group (10) people, so it took over an hour to seat us.  I expected this, so not a negative, just providing some insight. They seated half our group, then the other half about 10 minutes later.  Complimentary coffee while waiting is nice and the option to order a Bloody Mary or Mimosa, also a plus. I consider most breakfast joints very similar, so I'll go over the highlights  of this new venture:  Host and other staff were friendly.  Manager type person seating a couple at the counter where I was waiting on a couple of Blood Mary cocktails, not so friendly.  They could add a sign at the end of counter that says \"walk up drink orders\" and probably help out everyone. Breakfast cocktail selection was very good as well.  We tried the Gazpacho Bloody with pepper vodka and it was very tasty. Great and varied menu.  Creative offerings and the food itself was very good! We tried a number of things. The highlights included the Pancake flight, allowing you to mix and match three different pancakes.  Breakfast Pot Pie was delicious and filling.  They also had some tasty options for our non carnivore friend as well.  Regarding the comment about no paper towels in the bathroom.  The faucet has a built in Dyson Blade air hand dryer.  The only downside is if you are not familiar with this device you would benefit from reading the \"how-to\" they have posted right next to the sink.  Although I can certainly empathize that the last thing one might want to do on a Sunday morning breakfast is have to read instructions on how to dry one's hands! :)  All and all, good experience, great food.  Would I go back?  Yes.",

The fourth item finally arrived about 10 to 15 minutes after the first plates were delivered.  The up side was that the food was very good and they comped the delayed fourth plate.

So far they never disappointed me. I do want to venture out and try an item from their art of hollandaise menu  but I think I will save that for when I dine in. This place gets pretty busy especially on the weekends and I can see and taste why. A must try for those who haven't.",

I'm not one for the sweet pancakes though they are delicious.  I love the spuds with lots of fillings and a poached egg on top.  The benedict with the lox is killer good.  Go often - try everything!

    "text": "A lot of hoopla from my Denver friends so I had to check it out. High hopes ends in disappointment.   First issue, unorganized front desk. Seating people out of check-in order (same size party) makes for a frustrating experience. Four tables sitting empty for nearly 10 minutes with people waiting  (that never makes sense to me). From what I could tell, the front desk nedeed \"one\" person to take control. In a nutshell, too many employees standing around staring at the iPads.  After a 25 minute wait (we were advised 10-15) we make it to the table and I ordered a glass of cranberry juice. Whatever you do, don't order it! When it arrived in a tall glass it was nearly clear with a hint of pink. I knew at that very moment we had a problem. I took a sip and as I expected it was watered down and barely resembled cranberry. Why would you serve this? I then ordered the Bella Bella which was quite good. I would definetly recommend it.   So would I visit again? No",

You are able to substitute your hash browns or toast for a pancake for I decided to get a pineapple upside down pancake instead of toast.  I almost ate the whole thing.  The pancake was probably one of the best pancakes I have ever had in a really long time.  It wasn't too sweet and it was really fluffy.  I left a happy camper.  I will come back again and my recommendation is to come early to avoid the waits because as we were leaving, there was at least six or seven people waiting.",

I also had a side of scrambled eggs that were among the best I've had.  So I guess it was a mixed bag.  Great people, lousy coffee, not great pancakes but great eggs.

    "text": "My friend who used to live in Denver, where I believe Snooze is based, told me before they opened that the food was wonderful. Well, she was right. I can't believe my good fortune that they moved into the Town & Country in my 'hood. I came after a doctor's appt because I was starving from fasting.   I sat at the bar and was immediately greeted by the friendly bartender. Another lady saw my bandage from having blood drawn and was considerate enough to ask me if I wanted a piece of toast or something. I ended up ordering a \"flight\" of pancakes where you can order 1 of 3 different flavors. Whoever decided to offer that option is, in my opinion, a brilliant person. I also love that they have such distinct and interesting pancake options. I ended up noshing on carrot cake (which ended up being the fave), sweet potato and a \"pancake of the day\" which had chocolate chips and cherries. I got a side of the house-made chicken sausage which was amazing. I'm not sure what herbs they seasoned with but it looks like a pounded, cubed steak. But it was very moist and not too salty.   I've only been back there another time since and I exercised the half and half option for their \"art of hollandaise\" items. Another great option! I got to try two kinds of but the winner was the Havana Benny. Here's the description: Shaved Niman Ranch ham and slow roasted pork served over a savory Swiss cheese bread pudding and topped with poached eggs, Dijon hollandaise and diced house pickles. The ham was really the winning ingredient here but all of it came together nicely.   I noticed this place draws a varying demographic. I saw families with kids and grandmas like one would see at IHOP. But I also saw hipsters on the patio and at the bar. I'm not sure if the place's popularity is at play or because it's new, but weekends, expect an hour wait for brunch. Otherwise, try to go on a week day.",

Katy (tall light black skinned lady) was really unattentive (from getting back to us about what to order) to the food taking a very long time to come out (mind you we've been here 2 other times, busier, and have gotten our food faster than this.)   This time they failed us.  BUT Echo saved the day. She came to our table and sat down, talked to all of us, even took care of our whole bill. I will give this place 4 stars because of that right there. Professionalism. Thanks Echo.  Definitely for those of you reading this review, if you haven't tried this place, come and try it out!",

When you finally are seated, however, it's well worth the wait. The staff are all so friendly and if you joke with them they will joke right back. It's a pretty casual chain with the waiters wearing t-shirts and everything is super chill. Wait time for the food itself isn't too bad. Not as bad as the wait time to be seated. The prices are a little high but what I've found is that most high quality breakfast chains are. Convenience: 5/10 (but worth it!)  The food is out of this world. Everything that I have tried seemed to be cooked to absolute perfection. My favorite thing to get here is the spinach and mushroom omelet. It's so good! Every time I take someone new they are so impressed with the quality of the food and are so happy I introduced them to this place. Taste: 10/10 for sure  Overall I'd rate Snooze 5/5. The place is nice, clean, and tastes good. Everything I want in a breakfast chain and more!",

    "text": "Snooze is close to home, I've eaten there a few times.  It teeters on the edge of 4 stars, but doesn't quite achieve it.  Firstly...  As a proprietor, they need to get in touch with Town & Country management.  There is no reason diners should have to listen to a leaf blower for 10 minutes when we're trying to relax with the treat of Sunday breakfast out.  The building was designed thoughtfully allowing for an \"island\" effect and totally opening up so it is just a roof over head.  This doesn't work if there is a leaf blower 15 feet away.  On to the latte.  The latte mug is not a traditional shape, and does not work well for a foamy beverage.  Additionally I was told that they no longer provide Sweet N Low, which is the only sweetener I can use.  I'll either have to bring my own or go somewhere else in the future.  I buy a box 1500 packets for $10 at Costco - I'm not sure why they can't.  For the meal, I chose eggs benedict with ham.  While they have about 7 varieties of eggs benedict, they do not have traditional eggs benedict.  The hollandaise sauce was unique - not bad at all but not traditional.  I would have preferred a traditional eggs benedict offering.  Overall, it is A-OK, but they could easily move to 4 stars with Sweet N Low and no leaf blower and considering having a traditional eggs benedict since they offer so many varieties.",

The syrup they had was scrumptious and it was the best French toast I have ever had! It was very sweet.  One of my friends had three different types of pancakes and the sweet potato pancakes were to die for. All of the pancakes were good that she had but that was the highlight.  I also got hash browns and eggs on the side. The eggs were okay and the hashbrown was delicious! I was not disappointed with it at all.  So I give snooze 5/5 stars! It's definitely something to try and enjoy!",

Not Snoozes fault but I wanted go fight this couple as I fasted for 22 hours and was STARVING. Well I ended up getting a double FLIGHT of pancakes and my eggs Benny. one of the flights was comped & well I ate it all.

No explanation was given and when I asked they said it was coming. There was no apology, so maybe this is normal for Snooze?   Not sure if this is normal or not, but it does make me hesitate to return simply because I don't see myself wanting to spend another 2 1/2 hours at a restaurant.",

Cute surroundings. So what's not to like?   Noise this day made conversation a bit difficult, but that's me being a nitpicky Yelp reviewer, the kind I try not to be. I suppose the wait often required to get a table can be a more significant issue. There really is no off peak time at Snooze on the weekends. We usually opt for a very early or very late strategy, but this Saturday we showed up forty-five minutes before closing and still had a five minute wait just to put in our name and had another fifteen minute wait to be seated. There's really no easy solution for the unpredictable waits unless you have a flexible weekday schedule. Given the multitude of great breakfast spots in Phoenix, traditional and otherwise, you have to ask yourself if the food and ambiance at Snooze really is distinctive enough to be worth the hassle. For me? Usually not.   But every once in a while the \"Flight\" three pancake assortment calls my name. This day our table shared a total of six different pancakes, a fun dining experience I'd recommend if you're comfortable sharing.",

However, this was our second visit to Snooze and also the second time our food has come out completely cold.  After our first experience, we figured we would give the place another shot, as anyone can mess up, it's just part of being a busy restaurant, I get it. But our food came out completely cold for a second time!  Management and staff  were very polite and friendly, they did their best to make it right, even took care of our food (which was really nice).. But when you're paying $14 a plate for breakfast, it should come out hot and fresh. The food should always be priority #1, if you want repeat business.  I wish this place luck, but unfortunately we won't be back. Scramble has better food...",

They had both been to a Snooze before in CO so had talked up the food greatly before we headed out.  I always worry that I'm being oversold and it won't live up to the hype - I was wrong!  Everything was fabulous.  The decor is super cute here - I love anything with a vintage, retro vibe.  Cool colors and the jacks on the wall and the booths.  I liked the outdoor seating and the windows that are always open.    The food - one of the best breakfasts I've ever had.  We three decided to split a few different plates: flight of pancakes, eggs benedict, and breakfast sandwich.  The flight of pancakes is a great idea and perfect for sharing.  We had three different flavors: pineapple upside down, flavor of the day (lemon & blueberry w/oats), and a chocolate decadent masterpiece.  I loved them all equally.  So now I'm left to dream of more visits to Snooze and what fabulous breakfast to try next.  I think I know what I'm doing on Saturday!",

It only comes with 1 egg on top so I ordered a second egg for $2. The pancake trio(upside down pineapple, blueberry and strawberry)They were all very tasty but also very sweet. We also ordered the Benny Benedict which was delicious. They have a nice size menu with lots of options..I think they had 7 types of eggs benedict? We ordered family style to share between 3 of us. The hash browns were fantastic!!  Cons: -There's no place to sit/wait for your table. We were awkwardly standing in the way of people coming in and out. They have a bar area but it was busy and didn't have many seats. -They ask for your phone # to text you when your table is ready...I really didn't care to have to check my phone every few minutes to see if our table was ready. -Bathroom...very small, 2 stalls and the hand dryer is right in front of the stall so you can see someone drying their hands while you're using the restroom. -Worst part...the service!! Michael was our server and he couldn't have cared less. He was busy but a smile wouldn't have killed him. He was very cold and seemed like he was in a hurry to leave or had something else on his mind. We had to flag him down for refills/water. Someone else brought our food out, the pancakes came first....then we waited and waited for the rest of our food. He never checked on us or asked how our food was. We waited for quite a while for him to pick up our check while watching him do his side work.  Overall the food was delicious but service was all over the place. We went on Saturday around 1:30.",

Time keeps going by and it turns into another 30 minutes. I go up and ask what time are table will be next and they tell me someone took me off the wait list! I was next to the host table the whole time. The host team didn't seem to care. I got the next table after another 10 minutes. The food was ok, but I'm not going back after that horrible experience. What a waste of my Sunday morning!!!",

We arrived today and only had to wait for 35 minutes, which seemed reasonable given the other wait experiences.   We were seated and noticed the decor to be nice and the service to be friendly. The food was good, albeit smaller portion than I expected for $11.50. The Bloody Mary was a little blah, nothing special and the coffee was decent.  It was good. Not great.   I will be back...

    "text": "The Good:   The restaurant itself has a fantastic midcentury vibe with lots of open windows and nifty seating. The menu was packed with so many delicious-sounding choices that I had a difficult time choosing just one. Fortunately they would let you sub a pancake for your breakfast side so I got to choose two! The food itself was magical; everything tasted exactly right and the portions were perfect for a filling meal.  The Bad:  First off, we were told there'd be a ~20 minute wait to get in. I understand and have no big problems waiting at a busy restaurant, I even thought it was pretty whiz-bang that they'd take my number and text me when a table was ready. Half an hour later my phone was still silent so I checked in and it turns out that the girl had noted my phone number incorrectly. To her credit she seated us immediately after discovering the mistake.  Once seated one thing became immediately clear: this is a *noisy* restaurant. There were parties of boisterous, energetic folks whose voices followed suit, and I'm okay dealing with that. The problem is that the restaurant pumped in loud pop music on top of that, so there wasn't just the din of a busy restaurant but a cacophony of conflicting noises. If you are hung over or otherwise want a quiet meal this is not the right place for you.  The Manic Pixie Dream Girl (google it) who served us was nice enough, but seemed eager to leave the table every time she engaged us and ended up missing small details like the coffee my dining partner ordered and later cream for that coffee. Fortunately my dining partner had pre-loaded on complimentary coffee during our too-long wait for the table otherwise violence may have ensued.   The Weird:  While waiting for our table some old guy came walking up with his pot-bellied pig on a leash, the pig wearing a Snooze AM teeshirt. I don't always expect to see my breakfast before eating it.   TL;DR:  I have a full tummy, but dealt with too much noise and neglect to be satisfied with the meal or the experience.",

My party decided to order and share so I was able to try multiple things on the menu. Their flight of pancakes is a great deal- we got the pear, pineapple and blueberry streusel. All of them are great but the pear was my favorite! The brioche French toast is outstanding as well. The benedicts are great too because you can order both the same or 2 different ones. I went with the ham and chilaquiles and I loved the chilaquiles one! Hash browns are also great!   I really don't have a negative thing to say about this place. As a tip, they do get very busy so call ahead or be OK with a wait.  Can't wait to eat here again!",

Of course there was a long wait as others have mentioned, but they take your number and text you when your table is ready so you can mill about and shop at some places nearby is you wish. I love the retro decor, so cute and made you feel like you were some where else. Our server was nice but generally MIA. One of the reasons I gave it 3 stars is that it seems things happen a bit out of order and some tables get served super fast & others seem to be in another time zone slow. Anyhow, I got the snooze spuds deluxe and my guy got the huevos rancheros. I wish the spuds were cooked more, they were soggy & oily and generally not very flavorful. For my 2 fillings I had avocado & pico de gallo, which helped add a little flavor. However, if I went back here I would not order this again. The huevos rancheros was alright, had more flavor than the spud dish. If we ever rolled through one of these places again I'd be willing to go, but would probably opt for one of the pancake or French toast dishes instead. I wasn't all too impressed with the egg dishes. Love the ambiance though!",

Just insanely good. Wifey was a bore and got a pick three items omellete and some hash browns. all in all, fantastic food.

I can have bloody mary's for breakfast, chipotle for lunch (with all of their salsas), and indian food for dinner... without so much as a rumble from my tummy.  That being said, I ate one of their new sammies, the name of which escapes me. But basically, it was a pretzel bun, topped with cheesy eggs, a sausage patty, and cheddar hollondaise sauce... and one of the worst mistakes of my life.   I am still recovering, unable to eat or keep fluids down, but I do seem to be improving slowly.   Before this awful experience, I had eaten at the Snooze in Denver and found it to be a decent breakfast spot with bizarre, overly sweet pancakes. For that experience, I give them three stars... for this last experience, I give them none (but yelp makes me give at least one).  And getting sick once, is one too many times for me. This should NEVER happen at ANY resturant. Will definitely NOT be returning.",

All ingredients were prime, from the coffee to the side of fruit and everything in between. The interior decor is flawlessly hip-retro, and the table service is more than adequate.  Since time immemorial, breakfast restaurants counted on making money on volume and turnover rather than margin. But now at the upper end of the breakfast market, it seems they are pushing more to increase margins, as in $9 for 3-ingredient omelette with a side of hashbrowns. The meats on the side (including very good sausage) are an extra $2.50-$3.50. So count on, like, $15 for an omelette, a side of bacon, and a cup of coffee. Throw in a tip and . . . well . . . did you say you were on an expense account? Was that what I heard?  You don't come here to save money, but it still counts as a good value.",

Still a little too busy for mid week dining, but we were seated in less than 5 minutes. Egg Benedicts and pancakes are their specialty and you can mix different types. If you ask for their pancakes they'll bring you one for free. Overall great experience and highly recommended.",

I love nothing more than a perfectly poached egg and a solid hollandaise, any flavor hollandaise for that matter as long as it is rich, creamy, and made from scratch.  Snooze has got it!! 6 different types of Benedict!! I was in heaven!  My fiance had the corned beef hash which was more corned beef than hash which I greatly appreciated.  The gazpacho Bloody Mary and Bangkok Bloody Mary were awesome, great house Bloody Mary mix and you call it vodka.  Did I mention that I am a Bloody Mary nerd as well!! All around solid place. The atmosphere is retro hip yet still being a very comfortable environment.  I will have many more visits here. I left one star out for the service.  It was not incredibly attentive but not unfriendly.",

First, the use of technology was pretty cool.  They take your phone number and text you when your table is ready.  That was pretty cool.  I had scrambled eggs, hash browns and bacon and I substituted the toast with a Cinnamon Roll Pancake.  Everything I had was amazing.  The pancake was awesome.    The one mistake I almost made was having some of the pancake before I spread the butter that was on top.  Then I realized I didn't spread it and took another bite and wow.  That just really made a big difference.    The only real complaint I would have is that it takes a little bit for the food to come out but as good as it was, it was worth the wait.",

I have had the pineapple upsidedown, the sweet potato, the blueberry danish, and most recently, the blackberry sublime pancakes.   The blackberry sublime is my new front runner- it has key lime pie filling, blackberries, graham crackers, and mascarpone whipped cream. Just as amazing as it sounds.   If you're into something more savory, I would recommend the breakfast pot pie and the sandwich I am (basically eggs Benedict on a pretzel roll).",

My friends ordered the huevo rancheros, avocado egg toast, and burrito. They all seemed pretty content with their choices. However, some of Snooze's menu items are kind of mediocre for the price and could use some improving. For instance, my friends ordered the Bloody Marys with bacon infused bourbon... and while the bourbon was good the Bloody was completely lacking the fixings (bacon, pickle, olives, celery, etc.). I ordered the sweet potato hash and it was pretty flavorless despite the description reading that it was prepared with truffle oil. I wouldn't write off Snooze entirely, but I definitely would order something different next time.",

A great way to have breakfast and dessert at once. I typically sit at the bar when I go in, a New Jersey kid, Jimmy, is who usually helps me. He is awesome with always a good attitude and smile. Very attentive and never lets your coffee get dry.

I've had the Early Harvest Benny (delicious and filling yet feels somewhat healthy - mushrooms are good for you, right?) and the Breakfast Pot Pie (you walk out feeling like you just ate a camel), and both were great in their own way.  Looking at all the other satisfied customers around me, though, I can tell that I haven't even made a dent into all the delicious offerings on the menu.  Prices are very reasonable, and service is friendly.  Even better - a large variety of alcoholic brunch drinks!  Perfect for coming off a night shift.

    "text": "BEST BRUNCH in Phoenix?! Yes x100!  Brunch is my favorite meal ever and I don't take it lightly. The same goes for my husband. We've read tons of Phoenix articles and searched on Yelp, trying to find the best brunch spots. Snooze would occasionally appear on our search. Most Saturdays, we like to take full advantage of sleeping in on the weekends, after busy work weeks. We would hit snooze on our alarms and ironically never make it on time to Snooze the restaurant haha. It's closes at 2:30 pm. You know the best brunch places close early.  So FINALLY we got up early in the morning, got errands and cleaning done, with enough time to check out Snooze an AM Eatery. And let me tell you, this has to be one of the best brunch experiences we've ever had!  I'm from Los Angeles, so I've had my fair share of great brunches. Snooze has made it to my top 3 now.  DRINKS -- There is a great selection of unique drinks! We had the Dirty Drunken Chai and it was so good. We drink dirty chais weekly, so an alcoholic version of a chai latte made our weekend. Also, we had to try the mimosas - pomegranate and cherry. Pomegranate was better, in my opinion. Not a big fan of cherry flavor. But for cherry lovers, I'm sure it'd be tasty.  FOOD -- The food is soooo delicious!  My husband had the corn beef hash and loved it. He had something to say every time he took a bite, like,  \"this is the best corn beef I've ever had...  best tortillas... soooo good.\"  I had the chile verde benedict - with soyrizo for my meat, avocado instead of eggs, and vegan** hash browns!  + side of black beans (big portion for a side too)  **FYI vegans - the hash browns are not vegan, but they'll gladly cook a non-dairy version for customers. I'm so glad our server let us know in advance that they weren't vegan and offered a vegan version. Yay, a vegan friendly restaurant that doesn't make you feel bad for making vegan modifications!!  Also, we had the 3 pancake sampler! Peanut butter, mocha, sweet potato pancakes. Sometimes eating normal size pancakes is too much and makes you feel bloated. But these were the perfect size to share, try different flavors and fulfill a pancake craving.  SERVICE -- P-h-e-n-o-m-e-n-a-l ! And fast! Our drinks and food came out quick. Most of all, our server was Nikki and she was the BEST!! She was so genuine, personable, friendly, and kind. If there's anyone that knows the art of customer service in the restaurant industry, it would definitely be her. This lovely woman deserves a raise or a promotion (and employee of the month - we nominate her!),  because she knows customer service like no other. Nikki made my husband and I feel so comfortable and right at home. Because of her and the superb brunch food, we will be back and want to be usuals!  Thank you SO much to Nikki for the amazing, 5 star customer service!! And to Snooze for the wonderful brunch!",

When I got there the place was packed and without taking reservations we put our name down with a wait of 20-30 minutes. I didn't think that was too bad of a wait given we arrived at 9:30. We decided to look over the menu and it was nothing spectacular however I was excited to try their pancakes. Well the wait got longer and longer and eventually we got seated an hour later which to me is unacceptable. What was worse was that there were places available to sit but no server say guests there. When I ordered my hot chocolate it came in a regular glass with lots of whipped cream to were I needed a straw to even drink it but then being hot the straw bending. My food (veggie omelette and Taffy Apple pancakes where nothing out of this world. I'm glad I tried but will not return which is sad because I love breakfast!",

We were greeted and seated by the host and ignored for at least five minutes; I finally stood up from my seat I thought maybe they can't see us.  After being noticed, we placed our coffee order only to get a bitter tasting coffee.  I pushed it to the edge of the table hoping someone would notice, clearly by now they had to know we were there.  It just sat there for another 3 minutes.  Finally the waitress comes by and I told her something was wrong with my coffee; It had left a bitter taste in my mouth.  In the meantime, the restaurant manager, who resembles grumpy cat walks around greeting everyone else but, us. I have never felt so unwelcome at a restaurant before.  I will never visit this place again.  Word of advise, if someone is going to to spend 40+ and tip 10+ each visit, at least make them feel welcome. Tempe location rocks!  This place not!",

I reluctantly went and was thrilled there was a table open when I arrived. The restaurant gods were smiling on me. Obviously the place is popular and I can see why. The service was great. Our waitress was friendly, always ready to refresh coffee, making sure everything was OK. Not overbearing, just enough to feel taken care of. Now, I already had breakfast so just had coffee, other people ordered and they loved their food. The breakfast burrito was popular. It looked massive and not a single person was able to finish it, not because it was bad, but because of the size of the burrito. People seemed happy. Now, the burrito didn't come with any breakfast fluff on the side. You ordered the burrito and that is all that came, but it was ample. Next time I'll eat, but still won't wait in line.",

We played ping pong while we waited for our table to be ready at the suggestion of the hostess and had so much fun! As soon as we sat down our waiter, Michael, came up to us and asked for our drink order. I got the Spicy Bloody with only a slight eye roll from my mother, which was delicious. As newbies to Snooze, we asked Michael for help in deciding what to order and he had great suggestions for us. We could tell he knew the menu backwards and forwards, and he was happy to help us pick out some deliciousness. I ended up getting the Benny duo (one ham, one Bella! Bella!) for myself and the sweet potato pancakes for the table at Michael's suggestion. I don't remember exactly what my parents ordered because I was too excited for my selections, but they enjoyed sharing the sweet potato pancakes with me and what they ordered as well. Great food and even better service ensures that we will be repeat customers especially when I am in town!",

Its the kind of place people go to just because they went in Cali or CO.  If you have no place to be and want to wait hours for OK breakfast then this is the place for you!

The place was packed (which is a constant) and there were already several people waiting outside.  I took my new girlfriend with me and we were told it would be a 15 minute to1 hour wait. They took my phone number, so they could text me when our table was ready.  We got the text about 50 minutes later and we sat at a shaded table outside.  Our service was incredible and we were fully taken care of and serviced in a timely and friendly manner throughout the whole experience.   I ordered the OMG French Toast and it was wonderful as always (I have had it a couple of times now).  My girlfriend ordered the Chile Verde Benny (A woman after my heart!) which was also spectacular.  Even the house hash-browns were firmly crispy on the outside and delicious.

I recommend getting your eggs over easy/medium so you can break the yokes over the hash browns.  I only wish there was a little more melted cheese.  I also tried the Smashin' Pumpkin Pancake.  A little too sweet for my taste, but worth the try.  Maybe if I had asked for the cream cheese frosting on the side, it would have been better.

Servers are always busy so they don't hover over you, it did take a little amount of time to get her attention after discovering a lipstick stain on a friend's coffee mug (kind of gross but stuff happens) My partner had the steak benny, hanger steak on cheddar grit cakes with asparagus, mushrooms and tomato. He said the vegetables were good the steak was a little salty for some reason. The friend with the lipstick stain had the Huevos Rancheros and really liked it, our other friend just had basic eggs and hash browns. I had the \"breakfast pot pie\" and let's say it looked better than it tasted....it was okay don't get me wrong but as in other visits the rosemary sausage gravy had little taste.

I had the ham Benedict and it was served on GF toast. It was superb. A tried a GF pancake too and was not disappointed at all. The service was prompt and attentive. I will be back!!",

    "text": "This is my friend's favorite breakfast/brunch spot. I came to the other location last time I was in town, but forgot what I ordered. This time around I got the pancake flight with OMG French toast, pineapple upside down pancakes, and blueberry danish pancakes. My bf got the French toast meat. We called ahead to pick up the order. There's plenty of parking in the plaza and this location seems much bigger than the other (at least from what I could tell).  The OMG French toast mascarpone filling was the best partttt. The salted caramel and toasted coconut didn't really stand out though.   The pineapple upside down pancakes were my second favorite but they only had liiittle tiny pineapple bits in it. The cinnamon butter was so delicious though I would eat that on anything!  The blueberry danish pancakes had too much lemon cream cheese on top and inside (which I had feared but anticipated). And I definitely did not get any almond streusel topping which I was most excited about :(  Boyfriend's French toast was basic but again, that mascarpone was bomb dot com.  I'm pretty sure I got something savory last time so I'd want to come back again next time I'm around. Unfortunately, I had a really strong sweet tooth this weekend and the carb load made me feel ugh. Next time!",

I had the loaded spuds with chorizo and green chile sauce (my only complaint was that my dish must have sat waiting for the rest of the table order - it was lukewarm), and the table shared the French toast daily special. Yum. Another person at my table had the steak Benedict, which had the best hollandaise sauce I've ever had.   Service was fast and friendly. The menu is pretty big, with a great variety of choices.  I'm looking forward to my next visit.",

Initially I found Snooze in Austin TX, so I was thrilled to find one in Phoenix.   Be prepared on weekends, there is always a wait. However, they take your number and text you when they have your table - there is a Nordstrom Rack right next door so get some browsing done while you wait. The wait is usually shorter than they quote you, which I appreciate it!   I almost always get the Snooze Spuds Deluxe. The size is huge so you really could share if you wanted to... which I don't. The pancakes are also delicious. I have tried almost every mimosa, today I finally tried the Strawberry Mimosa - very sweet but refreshing, I would maybe combine it with orange or pineapple next time.   I need to venture out and try more items on the menu, so we will certainly continue to come back. The staff is always great!   Also don't be afraid to sit outside, I know it's Phoenix and it is hotter than hades these days but the misters and the umbrellas outside do make it tolerable and you'll get seated faster!",

And I enjoyed the bite I had of the Smashed Avocado.   My wife went with the OMG French Toast and her response was that they were appropriately named. Great flavor and raved about the Strawberries.   I got the Corned Beef Hash at the recommendation of our server and was glad I listened. The Hash had an excellent ratio of Corned Beef and potatoes.  The Corned Beef was nice thick pulls of meat. I also got a side of the thick, Smokey bacon which was great!",

First, the wait was pretty long. In fairness, it was a holiday, but from what I understand, it's sort of the norm here anyway. The look of the place is clean and hip, and the staff were nice, but the food was nowhere close to what we were hoping for.   My breakfast burrito, an item we were told is their most popular dish, was big, but so dry I couldn't finish it. My wife wasn't crazy about her eggs benedict or her Bloody Mary either. My cappuccino was okay, though nothing special. There was a slight mixup with the drinks, that we had to get corrected, the server was apologetic, and maybe the holiday rush added to the confusion. At the end of it all, we looked at eachother and asked, \"Did you think it was as good as you thought it would be?\" The answer was pretty obvious without having to say it.",

    "text": "Best. Pancakes. Ever! First of all, let's take a step back and think about pancakes. Pancakes is a breakfast staple that you don't think too much about, it's as common as eggs or toast, and when you see specialty pancakes on the menu you often see (and come to expect) regular pancakes with some fruit tossed in it. Well, I'm here to report that Snooze changes the pancake makin' game. One, they offer a pancake flight that allows you to taste three of their pancake varieties. Two, they serve you pancakes that focus on the art of cakes, and three, they subsequently ruin all other pancakes you will taste anywhere else. For my selection I chose: Pineapple Upside Down Cake, Sweet Potato, and Coffee and Donut. The Pineapple Upside Down Cake is sweet and delectable with the Sweet Potato also being good, but different. I liked the Coffee and Donut (literally tastes like it sounds), but would recommend the signature Pineapple Upside Down Cake out of the three. In addition, their Bloody Mary's are solid, and it's important to note since the cuisine is so good you almost forget about your beverages. This Snooze location is recognized to serve some of the best Bloody Mary's in the Valley, so if that's your drink of choice you'll be pleasantly content. Can't wait to come back!",

I ordered the bacon/egg/hash brown plate and an order of flight pancakes to share.  My pancakes included pineapple upside down,  cinnamon roll and pain buttermilk.   I wasn't too crazy about the pineapple cake but the cinnamon roll one was absolutely awesome, it was pure perfection on a plate,  the buttermilk even though it's just a plain pancake it was equally good too.   This is a great little spot if you arrive early enough to beat the crowd or don't mind a wait if you arrive later. Whatever you do just get here.",

Modern retro decor and this place is always buzzing. Always a wait to get in on the weekends because everyone knows how great it is, totally worth it. I don't even blink if they say it going to be 45 mins or more, although usually we get in quicker than they estimate. This is THE place we bring our out of town guests for breakfast and it always impresses. I'm currently on a Spuds Deluxe kick but I also enjoy the Sandwich I Am, breakfast burrito is also excellent and my girlfriend is always thinking about the sweet potato pancake.",

But...kinda expensive for value. Heads up, if you like this stuff (and I do), you can get it frozen at Trader Joe's, around the corner of the shopping center, and it's good.

However; even for three eggs, it was pretty dense and for $9 I think access to more than three fillings (including cheese) without extra charges wouldn't be asking too much.   It did come with hash browns and toast, so that certainly does help justify the price being a dollar or two more than I would like to pay for breakfast.  The orange juice is awesome.  It tasted like the oranges were squeezed to order.  The employees are awesome.  I was alone just trying to get a quality bite to eat while my car was being worked on down the street.  I sat at the bar and the server was quick and efficient handling all the people sitting around.  He also offered everyone at least a water \"to-go\" as they paid their checks (anyone who had tea or coffee was offered that in a take out cup).  Snooze is bigger, cleaner, and more modern looking than most of the breakfast spots you're probably used to hitting up.  It's certainly worth at least a try.  But next time, I think I'm going to try the pancakes.  Or maybe the french toast.",

    "text": "Good, but not great.  Perhaps a shortage of breakfast spots in the area are contributing to the hype..?  They were consistently busy from 9am to 10:30 am on a Thursday, which I found impressive... It was spring break though, so maybe that had something to do with it.  On to the food review:  I had a pancake flight and enjoyed em, but was not blown away by them.  The best part of the pancakes were the toppings.  Both the marscapone on the apple, and the caramel sauce and ginger butter on the sweet potato were uber-yummy.  The pineapple upside down and apple pancakes on their own were not impressive.  The sweet potato pancake was good on its own.  The others at my table LoVeD their hashbrowns. The portion was good and the seasonings were perfect.  The table unanimously HaTeD the bacon. To say it was crispy is an understatement.  It was about 8 seconds on the grill from being bacon dust.  By the time our server came by, we were wrapping up eating and didn't want to wait for new sides to be made though. She was nice about it and comp'd the house made chicken sausage I ordered as an apology.  The chicken sausage wasn't anything I would order again.  It was ground chicken, lightly spiced and placed on the griddle under a press ... served up flat as a board!  Not very attractive and only mildly tasty, which improved slightly with salt.  My mom had the breakfast burrito with both red and green sauce.  That was probably the winner at the table and the green sauce was darn good.  Snooze has great coffee and BIG mugs, which was nice cuz as I mentioned, service can be a bit slow w/refills and to check on you.    I'd consider returning if prompted by friends.  Not sure I'd wander that far on my own for breakfast when places like Morning Squeeze are close by and have been unanimously stellar.",

Really glad we found this place and look forward to visiting the one in my home state soon.  We hit Snooze right after hiking Camelback Mountain so we were starving and ready for a hearty breakfast. Snooze did NOT disappoint!.  Tara ordered the Huevos Rancheros. She was convinced that she would need my help to finish it but it was soooo good that she got er done all by herself! I did get a couple of bites and it rocked! I ordered an Omelette with chorizo for some extra kick and protein. Like the Huevos, this dish was amazing as well. Very tasty and appropriately filling.  Our servers were terrific as well. One was from Colorado and was the one who enlightened us to the fact that this place got started there. Not only was she very attentive, she surprised us with the house special pancake as an additional treat! Like the rest of what we had, it was rock solid!  Next time we're in Denver, I'm hunting another one down!",

    "text": "I've been to Snooze a few times and it's always been a fantastic experience. There's usually a pretty long wait but it's absolutely worth it.  I definitely recommend putting your name on the wait list well before the morning hunger pangs kick in!  The upside to the long wait is that they will send a text when your table is almost ready so you don't have to hang around outside in the crazy AZ heat.  Head down the street to a coffee shop or do a little shopping next door while you wait. No more waiting in a designated perimeter with a pager! Freeeeedom!  The menu is perfect for brunch seekers with adult beverages like the Morning Manhattan,   Bangkok Bloody Mary or the Pineapple Mimosa. My favorite food item is Juan's Breakfast Tacos and their selection of Eggs Benedict is pretty wicked. I've brought both friends and family here and everyone has fallen in love with this place as the food is amazing and the retro 60s vibe offers something unique to the typical brunch experience. Snooze offers a refreshing take on some of the traditional brunch items and you truly get a sense that they put great thought and effort into their menu.",

Once we found out it was here in Phoenix we were ready to go!  I went with her suggestion and ordered a pancake flight.  This is a genius idea and gives you your choice of 3 pancakes of your choosing.  I had their pineapple upside down, apricot buttermilk and a BanaNutella.  They were absolutely fabulous!  I know we are all trying to cut back or avoid carbs these days but this is definitely worth the splurge!  If it makes you feel better, go hike a mountain first then get some delicious pancakes!! I will be back for sure!",

No One had a bad thing to say about any of these choices.  We all enjoyed our food, the service was great, and the atmosphere more than cool.    The second day we came (yes....two in a row), we came with different family members.  Choices included the Sandwich I Am, the Breakfast Tacos, the Breakfast Burrito, the OMG! French Toast, the Spring Salmon Cobb salad, and the tomato soup and grilled cheese.  Again, everyone enjoyed their choices and reviews were rave.  When in town, we will be back.

There is plenty to do in the shopping center to keep you busy but plan on waiting on the weekends!  Their various egg Benedict options are delicious especially since there are 3 different hollandaise sauces to choose from - cream cheese, cheddar and Dijon! The pancakes are very yummy so get a flight so you can try three! I recommend the sweet potato, pineapple upside down cake and blueberry Danish.

In addition, after reading the previous reviews, I believe people gave A-Ok reviews based on the wait.  However, if you break it down, this is a BREAKFAST restaurant that specializes in pancakes my taste buds have never tasted in my life.  It is popular and new, therefore, there will be a wait!  I wrote an awesome review about the location in San Diego, and I will say the quality and taste is just the same in Phoenix.  For those that have tasted better pancakes elsewhere, please tell me so I can try them.  On the other hand, their pineapple upside down and caramel apple pancakes are so sweet you think you were eating dessert.  All other pancakes shiver in its presence.  If you want a more thorough review, read up on my San Diego review.  However, they have amazing pancakes with a great selection of your traditional breakfast platters with a twist.  Check in, walk around and shop, enjoy your company, and feast on some great brunch at Snooze!  We will see you again Snooze!",

I went the first time during lunch, and got there at 11:15 so we didn't have to wait. I got the huevos rancheros, and it had no flavor at all. For the price of lunch/breakfast here, I really do expect everything to be top notch.   The next time we came made me officially take my stars to a 3. Actually, it would have been a two but the waitress (Brittany, maybe??) made up for it. Got  there at 11:40, and was told for a group of 3, it'd be 15 minutes. The hostess didn't greet me, and was not polite. Well, that wait turned into a little over thirty. I was about to walk away, when I got the text my table was ready. We go to the hostess, and she just leaves- although she knew who I was and that I had been waiting for a table, and cleans tables for a few minutes- SLOWLY, then sends someone else to take us to our table. I don't know what I did to her, but she was very rude and not helpful at all.   The \"chicken pot pie\" (that's not the name of it, but it's a similar dish) was very good and so was our server.   I will try to avoid this location at lunch, and I can't wait for the Gilbert one to try near my home.",

They added a ton of delicious stuff. I tried the caprese eggs benedict a little worried I made a terrible decision. Alas, the food came out and I did not make a terrible decision. The egg was cooked perfectly. Execution: flawless. Devour time: 4 min.   The only thing I hate is the wait time but I guess that is a good thing..for them. Always packed. They just implemented a new system to let you know your table is ready though; they text you which is great.. You can go walk around the shops while you wait.  Don't forget to try a beermosa.",

    "text": "Solid 3.5 stars. The food is good but not worth the,[hour] wait.   Maybe once the \"new\" wears off the wait will be less.  They also need to reevaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of their seating and dining area.  There is definitely opportunity to maximize and utilize the space better. Severally tables that could accommodate 4 or more were filled with pairs/couples. While these particular table-booth hybrids look cool, they are inefficient in terms of seating management. They do offer coffee for those waiting outside. [As you enter the door turn right. It is against the back wall to the right if the bar/counter.] Unfortunately we discovered this after a trip to Dunkin Donuts for some coffee to tide us over.   Upon checking in they enter your phone number and text you when your table it's ready. Which is 'good' because with an \"45-60 minute wait\" you have time to check out neighboring stored in Town & Country Center.  In hind sight we should have gone across the street to Daily Dose Midtown.   The food:  There were 3 of us. One had the traditional eggs Benedict ( to their credit they have several varieties of benedicts to choose); one had the Potato pile up ( or something like that) and added 2 eggs. I ordered the pancake flight (choice of 3 pancakes from their regular or daily menu) pineapple upside down cake, carrot cake and the daily special peanut butter and jelly, with a side of bacon.  Like I mentioned at the get go I have no complaints over the food. The ingredients are quality and prepared well. As an example, the hollandaise was done well and eggs poached well.  I am not a pancake person but the varieties were too tempting. No syrup necessary with the toppings unique to each choice. The pancakes were not  as sweet as I expected, which was a very pleasant surprise.   I can see myself going back eventually. Although I have put this into the same category that I have Matt's Big Breakfast, good but not worth the wait, and will likely try it again in the summer before 10am.",

Our server was on-point, and the entire atmosphere of the restaurant was super cute and retro. You can tell the owners put a lot of emphasis on the details.  One last note: They have a wall of windows on every side of the restaurant with bar seating, and every window opens completely! So on a nice, sunny 70 degree day it's absolutely beautiful to sit in these areas. Highly recommended!

If you go by the bar, they give you whatever bevy you need so your wait isn't awful. They give you coffee in handle-less mugs and not disposable cups so you know that they care if you stay and not just leave. Also, they send you a text when your table is almost ready so you can roam around while you wait. And let me tell you, it is worth the wait. When you are seated, all the staff great you as they see you and the customer service is great! The menu may not look like a lot of options but when you read them, you want to try them all!! Fortunately, you can do some mix and matching so you can try a few dishes at one. For instance, if you like 2 of their eggs benedicts, you can get one of each! They have the pancake flight where you can have 3 different delicious pancakes on one plate. Speaking of which, we ordered the pancake flight that had pineapple upside down, caramel apple and sweet potato. Listen...I don't even like pancakes like that but these...these were f-ing delicious!!! They were light, not overly sweet and not too many overspend to over power the dish. Also, I'm not a big sweet potato/sweet potato pie fan but I'd those sweet potato pancakes all day; they were that good! We also got (we split the dishes so we can taste everything lol) the 3 egg omelette with chorizo, caramelized onions and jack cheese which came with a little tower of seasoned hash browns. Those eggs were fluffy and delicious; not runny at all or slightly browned, just perfect. We also topped it off nicely with the Mmm Mmm Mimosa; tasty and gets you toasty! Like I said, so glad I went. Our server Bianca was awesome and I'll definitely promote this place!",

    "text": "So far, two brunches here. And I look forward to adding to that number!  Visit one - with a pescatarian girlfriend.   We each had a coffee (tasty blend - good roast - FRESH!) and started by splitting the pancake of the day. I really don't remember what was in/on it...but it was divine. My friend claimed it was the best pancake of her life - and she's a pancake fiend! There were a couple of the benedicts that were jumping out at both of us - so we decided to split two of them. Turns out - Snooze is happy to split up the benedicts for anyone at anytime - so we didn't even have to agree on the two to share. Since there is so much goodness in each - I am just copying the details from the menu on the ones we had:  \"Late Harvest Benny - Wilted Swiss chard, fennel and leeks served atop goat cheese and herb polenta cakes with poached Niman Ranch eggs, cream cheese hollandaise and toasted pine nut crumb.\" and \"Upstream Benny - Honey Smoked Salmon tossed with cucumber and corn salsa and served over jalapeno-cream cheese spoonbread, topped with poached Niman Ranch eggs and cream cheese hollandaise\" They were both absolutely phenomenal!  Visit two - with a male friend notorious for his appetite and food snobbery.  Since it worked so well the first time - I suggested we split the pancake of the day. Again - no memory of the crack they addled it with - but I could not stop - and I want to go back and get the daily pancake every day! I opted for the breakfast pot pie, and he had the sweet potato pancakes. Both were great - the puff pastry on the breakfast pot pie was absolutely perfectly executed. The pancakes weren't overly sweet - and the bits of ginger really made the dish shine!  There was a 20-30 minute wait each time - and both visits were intentionally planned to be around the \"slower\" times. I truly dislike waiting for a table - but Snooze, you make it so worth it!  See you soon!",

    "text": "IN THIS CASE IF YOU SNOOZE YOU DON'T LOSE!  I've been to the Snooze in San Diego a couple times and absolutely loved the place.  In that Yelp review I said I was happy that they didn't have one here in Phoenix.  Cause if they did then I would turn into a fat ass from being there so much. So when I saw they opened up a Snooze out here I had to go.  This Snooze doesn't look as good or as big as the one in San Diego. But I came here for the food and the food did not completely disappoint.  What drew me there to begin with was the pineapple upside down pancakes.  I had a pancake flight, which allows you to pick 3 different pancakes.    I got the pineapple upside down, the carrot, and sweet potato pancakes along with the Green Eggs and Hammich.  The sandwich was good, but it wasn't anything great on the same level of the pancakes.  My girlfriend had the Sandwich I am and it was pretty bland.  I ended up being a good boyfriend and switching sandwiches with her since she liked mine.  Her daughter got chocolate chip pancakes.    The reason i couldn't give this Snooze 5 stars is because of the service and the wait time.  We had to wait for about 45 minutes for a table on a Saturday morning. Now granted it was Saturday and even the Snooze in San Diego you had to wait a while for a table.  But the difference with that one was every seat was packed. And when they told you that your table was ready, your table was ready.  Here they text you to let you know that your table is ready. Then we had to wait another 5 minutes for our table to ready. The Snooze out here looked like it still had quite a bit of room to seat a good portion of people who were waiting to get tables. We sat on the patio cause it was quicker and they still had a whole other corner that could be used for seating.  For some reason they have a ping pong table taking up that whole area instead.  The other reason is the service.  Our waitress was nice but she was very neglectful, at least to our table anyway.  She brought the chocolate chip pancakes with no syrup.  she didn't come back around to ask us if we wanted anymore water, napkins, or anything else. I had to get up and grab some hot sauce from the service cart myself.  She was going around to all the other tables around us asking them if they needed anything, going over menu items with other patrons.  The 2 ladies who sat across from us had a dog with them and the dog got better service than us.  Speaking of dogs, i love dogs. If you want to bring dogs into the restaurant that's all fine and good. But to have the dog sitting at the table with you while you eat (and not a little dog either) that's a bit much.   Like i said she wasn't mean by any means, but she was not a good waitress. Will i be back at Snooze? DUH! Does a frog bump its ass when he hops?  Of course i will be there again.  The pineapple upside down pancakes are what brought me there and the pancakes are what will keep me coming back.",

Service is extremely friendly and great, but its EXTREMELY SLOW. Everytime I've gone we always get bloody mary's and mimosa's and it takes FOREVER. Then the food takes even longer to get, but you know what?? Its worth the wait. Expect to be waiting for a table too, each time I've gone its been about 45 min.",

    "text": "This is an update to my earlier, less-than-complementary review of Snooze.  I was contacted by them and agreed to give them another try.  I met up today, with a pal, for coffee and catchup The place was quite busy at 10 am on a Tuesday.  I mentioned that to the hostess and asked to be seated in a quiet spot so was taken to the back of the restaurant.  She found a tiny table for 2, which was quite close to a big table of diners.  I asked if we could sit at the table for 4 right next to it and then noticed seating outside, so decided to move out there.  Our hostess was visibly annoyed by that.  Once we settled in, the service and food were fantastic.  My friend had a yummy-looking pancake and I had Rye toast with a side of Salmon.  Our server was very nice about letting us hang out for a good long while.  So, the long and short of Snooze?  GOOD: food, wait staff, pricing, ala carte options, location, parking, super-cute decor and menus.  Could be better: noise levels and the hostess ...both of these are easy fixes with some Emotional Intelligence training. and some serious sound-dampening efforts.    Our server DID mention that you were working on the wait times.  Still a deal breaker for me but I wish you the very best as you get it figured out.  Again, summer is almost upon us and your business is bound to suffer if you can't vastly reduce those times..  Thank you again for the opportunity to re-review, Snooze.  Keep working those kinks out!",

When we first walked in we were amazed how busy it was, it was about 89% filled.  In our heads we knew this place was going to be amazing.  The restaurant was clean, and looked super modern, which was cool.  The bathroom was super clean, you can tell they took care of it!!  You could probably eat in there if you wanted.  Service was quick and excellent.  The staff was fast, efficient and attentive.  I ordered the a benedict with ham, and it was absolutely amazing.  Unlike any benedict I had before.  So if you want a benedict come here and get your benedict fix.  I don't remember what my two coworkers ordered but they did get coffee and loved it, and even took some with them in the fancy cup.    Overall a great breakfast food type restaurant, the only draw back to this place is probably the prices.  Fortunately for us one of my coworker's dad is a doctor and we used his black looking credit card.  So be sure to thank a doctor!!",

Not only was she so passionate about the company she works for and was talking about how great it was to work there, but her customer service was amazing. She checked in on us the perfect amount and was so educated about the menu and what there was to offer, I almost bought 5 meals because she was selling me on all the yummy options.   She also made the sweetest gesture and bought us a gluten free cinnamon roll pancake for the table to try. It was such a nice treat and was soo sweet of her! I will definitely recommend this spot for anything visiting Arizona! Thank you Jessica for the positive and happy start to the day!",

I also love that they partner with DoorDash and have had it delivered to my home as well. This place is so good, you can't go wrong with exploring the menu. Usually I always stick to my usuals anywhere I go, but here I know I can't go wrong trying new things! Snooze classic, and spuds deluxe are my favorite! Their hash browns are perfect. This place is perfect for night shifters, with an amazing drink menu. My favorite is the Bangkok Bloody Mary, it's spicy and tasty, and of course you can't go wrong with their mimosas. For two, our bill is usually $$, not the cheapest breakfast joint, but you pay for quality here. If you plan on going to brunch on a Saturday or Sunday morning, get there early! Be prepared for a wait time because this place has a lot of customers. Going super early is probably the best option. Going around 10-11am you will be waiting from 45 minutes to an hour. Also, Charles has been my usual waiter and he is amazing. I'd ask to be seated in his section.",

    "text": "Place was great... with so many breakfast and coffee options in this area I feel like I stepped into Seattle on a freaky warm and sunny day. Staff here was great and the Ham Bennie was on point!   On a side note, lately I've been over-tipping as little experiment. I took my average tip from 18-20% to 35-40% with a minimum of $10. This place wrapped up my 20 restaurant experiment.   Interestingly, I haven't noticed any change in the mannerism of the servers. I don't know if they think I don't know how to tip or 35-40% just isn't enough to get their attention. Also, it's not in cash, so maybe the larger tip loses its' effectiveness when paid by amex.  Respectfully, I'm curious at what point a server gives you the extra smile and 'thank you' as you walk out the door.   Next experiment... I'm still going to pay by card, I do too many business meals and like the points. So I will zero out the credit card tip and tip out in cash. Minimum $10 and average of 40-50%. I will also try to round up to the nearest $10, $20 and $50 bill. I will let you know how it goes.   And remember, food service is usually a pretty thankless job with some crummy hours. I encourage you to over tip and find the line between 'sucker' and making someone's day better. Besides, aren't smiles priceless?",

Almost no place will cook eggs not runny, no matter how much we ask.  However, it was delicious.  The cannelloni pancake was OK, but I prefer fluffy, light pancakes and this one was too bready.  The ricotta was great though.We really appreciate a restaurant that sources humane meats.  The service was very good.  I would eat here again anytime.",

It does get busy, so I do recommend going early. We went around 7 AM and luckily got one of the last few tables before it started getting super busy.   Nicely decorated atmosphere with their own special decorations. Loved that they had cute modern round tables in the middle of the restaurant.   Food wise, I ordered the Reuben sandwich. Yes crazy to have this for breakfast, but it was available; and Reuben sandwiches are my favorite! Definitely a great tasting sandwich, and it does come with a side salad if you prefer. My friend ordered their pancake flight; and she choose the sweet potato, blueberry danish, and bourbon street pumpkin pancakes.   I do recommend if you're in the area and need a breakfast place; try out Snooze!",

It was OMG for two reasons: 1) it taste delicious and 2) the portion was tiny. If there was a kids size OMG French toast I think I had it. I was told that they have a new vendor for gluten free bread and their bread size is small. I understand that, but what I DO NOT understand is not including an additional piece of French toast to offset the size.   When our waiter asked if everything was ok I expressed my dismay over my kid size meal. He brought over more on the house. I appreciated that and tipped generously. I want other gf diners to be aware there is a big size difference between the brioche French toast and the gluten free French toast.",

Ended up sitting outside and enjoying the weather.  The menu is so fun for foodies.  My daughter and I ended up sharing a Benedict flight that included a Mexican style Benedict and an Italian style Benedict with prosciutto.  Both were good, though I enjoyed the Italian style one more.  We also shared a pancake flight with pineapple upside down pancake, white chocolate with hot chocolate drizzle and homemade marshmallow and blueberry streusel.  All were good but not great.  So glad I tried this place but TC Eggingtons is still my favorite for breakfast in the valley.",

The staff was so receptive and kind and seated my friend and I right away. Snooze's menu is extensive, but their main feature is their pancakes. I ended up getting their egg scramble, which comes with three choices of topings (on them) and and toast and hashbrowns. I got my scramble filled with chicken sausage, Spinach and feta; and selected rye toast as my side. Oh wow, the scramble was so delicious! Everything was so fresh, light, and tasty--only thing I added was a little bit of peppet for some spice otherwise everything was great! This includes the rye toast that came with their homemade jam!! The hashbrown cake rounded everything out and was just enough for a great 11am breakfast!!  I love that Snooze uses local ingredients in all of their breakfast and brunch items! Totally check them out when you need to hit the snooze and may miss making your own breakfast!!",

    "text": "I just recently visited Phoenix Arizona, and getting off the plane, this was my first place to stop and eat.  It was around lunch time, so my girlfriend and I looked up local brunch places, and this place looked like a hit from all the positive reviews and awesome photos. It did not disappoint.  There was about a 20 minute wait, but it went by fast.  Upon getting seated,  the service was quick and very nice to us. We ordered 2 different mimosas to begin, and they were excellent.  For our meals, I went with the pancake flight and she went with the benny duo.  Omg, the different types of pancakes were to die for. I ordered the 3 most popular ones, and loved them all. If I had to rank them, the pineapple upside down would probably be my favorite. My girlfriend also enjoyed her meal and thought it was excellent.   This was the perfect brunch spot to begin our trip in Arizona.",

The service wasn't as great as it is at other ones. The pluses were that we got in and out cause there wasn't a wait at 830am. The nitro cold brew was good though and would definitely suggest. The Bella Bella Benny was delicious and they had gluten free French toast which was also good.",

The Soyrizzo and hashbrows are a perfect match when paired with the vegetables and the green chili sauce! This burrito is huge so bring your appetite or a Tupperware from home.

I absolutely love the food! I got \"the snooze classic\" and I recommend it for those who would like to keep it simple. My boyfriend got the \"OMG French Toast\" and it is soooooo good.   About the service, it was really busy today so I know some servers get overwhelmed. I never got my orange juice. Our server could barely remember what we ordered. She seemed incredibly stressed out which made me overwhelmed. Service could have been better but like I said it was busy and food was good.",

Given their popularity, I would definitely recommend coming early if you want to avoid the long wait. What I love most about Snooze is that you can pretty much get a half order of any item on the menu. That way if you like having both savory and sweet for breakfast, you can really have both without over-ordering!   During my visit, I got to try the Bella Bella Benny (eggs benedict with prosciutto and arugula) and the O.M.G. French Toast (comes with strawberries and toasted coconut shavings). Both dishes were so good and flavorful! Highly recommend trying both items, and highly recommend dining at Snooze in general!",

Before catching my flight back home, I popped in for a quick bite - and more importantly, a Bloody Mary.  The service was genuinely friendly and very fast. My Bloody Mary was spicy and TASTY ... and I'm now realizing I've been robbed by living almost 30 years without having a crispy strip of the best protein ever in my drinks. I ordered the Snooze Spuds Deluxe and it was fresh and perfectly flavored. I added bacon and avocado, and chose over easy eggs. The bacon was crispy and delectable, avocado green and fresh, and yolks nice and runny.  10/10 would recommend. If I'm ever back in the Phoenix area, I'll for sure be Snoozin'. And in the meantime, I'm adding bacon to my beverages.",

I grabbed the blueberry danish pancakes and the hashbrowns and it felt like I was in a brand new restaurant. The pancakes were absolutely delicious and the hashbrowns were flavorful and yummy, esp when compared to last time. Frankly, during my last experience the tofu scramble was cold and watery and the hashbrowns were underwhelming. But this time the pancakes were stellar and the hashbrowns were out of this world! A+ for killing it on the second try. Definitely hit up this place for literally anything but the tofu scramble. It has the capacity to hold larger groups though it does tend to be crowded and busy most of the time.  Service was super super good this time and I'm more than happy to return for more yummy food!",

We went on a Wednesday at 10am and there was a 45 minute wait... BUT, being the hottest day of the year so far (114) , the patio had no wait. They turned on the misters and with a cup of water, it wasn't bad at all.   I got the pancake flight, $8, with two Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes and one Flavor of the day. I DREAM about the Pineapple Pancakes. The hash browns are well seasoned, $2, and the kids meal comes with a lot for only $6 (Fruit, eggs, toast, hash browns, juice).

They have several locations in Colorado and their breakfast is truly unparalleled in unique menu items, quality options, and healthy alternatives. Throw in the quirky/laid back atmosphere first trademarked in Denver, and you've got a recipe for a pretty kickin am eatery!!   The food I could write about--and drool over--all day. Their pancake flights are a MUST. Far too many great choices, in addition to their awesome daily specials, to decide on just one type. Among my favorites are the bananutella and the pineapple upsidedown pancakes. Don't be afraid to throw in a plain ol' buttermilk either because simple is still superb!   I have never had a server I didn't like. Apparently being welcoming, accommodating, and perfectly friendly is a hiring requirement. You know how sometimes you can just tell when employees are happy with where they work (just how you can tell when they're definitely not...)?! This is one of those places. Everyone is happy and that happiness is contagious. What an awesome place! Job well done Snooze! Thanks for moving into town!",

The omelette was good but not outstanding, and I tend not to trust any food that is molded into a shape like the hash browns were.  The service added to the meh. When the server came around she used condescending pet names like \"love\" and \"sweetie\", which was annoying.  In addition, I was not given any creamer for my coffee or any jam for my toast and the music is way too loud to have a conversation.",

    "text": "I love this place! Love it. Breakfast at lunch time. Yay! My friends whisked me off without much notice and was so happy with their choice. This is the cutest darn place! Booths galore with round tables down the center aisle. (Best for 4 ppl.)  After ordering a heavenly cappuccino (it really was that good) I studied the menu. With so much to talk about I had a hard time picking a meal. When I spied an entire section with eggs benedict's I focused my energy there. The very kind server helped my indecisiveness by explaining that my order could consist of 1/2 of anything. Phew! I really like eggs so I stayed in the Benny section.   The Bella! Bella! Benny spoke volumes to me with prosciutto, Taleggio cheese, topped with a cream cheese hollandaise on a toasted chiabatta. I had forgotten a balsamic glaze would be sprinkled over the (perfectly gooey egg). Until now I had *no idea* my palate craved a hint of bitterness on an egg. Good stuff!  The Upstream Benny is smoked salmon served on a jalapeno-cream cheese spoonbread. I gotta tell you, I loved the bread! Salmon is something you can't go wrong with. Healthy, and quite delicious, when paired with cucumber and corn salsa.  I meant to fork sample my friend's pineapple pancake. Uh. Well, I ate an ENTIRE half. Sweet bejeebers that was divine.  I've never had anything quite that like that. I can't do justice to explain why. The pancake was super fluffy, the pineapple made it sweet (of course) and the butter made it dance in my mouth. HOH. MY. GAWD.   The service here is impeccable! Mercedes was such a gem. Full of information and oh so patient. (We were talking too much and maybe taking a hair too long to order.) Our coffee and waters were constantly refilled and she was overflowing with genuine happiness.  Hurry in to grab a seat kids! This place is first come first served. Alas, no reservations.",

To our surprise, there was no wait. We were seated immediately in a comfy round booth. Ordered the breakfast burrito with the ranchero sauce no meat. It's been over 24 hours and i am still thinking about my burrito. My mom had the huevos rancheros, she loved her dish as well. My son had the kids blueberry pancake. And we ordered an extra buttermilk pancake plus two coffees- $50 after tip. Which for me is pretty expensive for breakfast. But the food was good. Service could have been better as I had to flag down other servers for more ranchero sauce, napkins, refills, etc. overall had a good experience, but is a bit on the overpriced side for breakfast.",

I had a great first visit, and now I'm counting the days until a 2nd AZ location opens in downtown Gilbert.  Usually I automatically go for savory breakfast options, but the sweet choices looked so tempting. I finally handed my menu to my 9 month old dining companion, and she pointed to the benedict section. The late harvest benny was delicious, and unlike any other benedict I've ever had. Instead of english muffins, the perfectly poached eggs, goat cheese and swiss chard sat on top of polenta cakes. The cakes were on the smaller side which made them a nice portion size for me. Our group loved the hashbrowns on the side because they were very crisp and had plenty of pepper.   One friend got the pancake flight (blueberry, peanut butter and apple), and another got the OMG french toast. I was hoping to try a bit, but there was barely a morsel left when they were done.   I can't wait to go back although I'll still be torn between the sweet and savory choices. I checked with the company, and their ranchero and green chili sauces are all vegetarian.",

My husband ordered the Chilaquiles Benedict. My toes curled in delight. Amazing. I had the breakfast burrito and added bacon to it.

Anytime there is marscapone and caramel on bread - yes, please. I was going to order two meals and just split them but decided to do a sweet and savory (added the sweet potato pancakes) for $4. Just means I'll have to come back and try those blasted French toasts (toasti?).  Decaf coffee was yummy. The cornbeef hash was unlike any I've ever had! Definitely house made, with the surprise addition of green peppers. Usually I'm a GP skeptic (rightfully so, I think), but these were seasoned beautifully and added a depth to the hash that I really enjoyed. A side of Cholula hot sauce, and it never stood a chance. The eggs were perfectly cooked, but a little bland. Just threw some hot sauce on them and kept chewing.   That pancake ... the sweet potato in the pancake was subtle and complimented perfectly by the caramel (which I could eat on everything!) it wasn't too thick either. The meal was a reward for finishing a 5K, and I was not at all disappointed. In myself or Snooze!",

No wait, but not a great experience since people were trying to order drinks all around me. Did I mention I had to stand to eat?   The place plays very, very loud music. That is never a negative for me. I love music. If I think music is loud it is really loud. However, for a breakfast place it seemed strange. Don't go here with a hangover, migraine or if you do not like crowds. People were all over the place waiting to get in.   The coffee was not anything great but I have to admit the food was FAB! I got the sweet potato pancake and sausage links and it was seriously Delish!!!! It makes me sad because there are so many things I have heard are so good here. I want to go back but I probably wont. Well, maybe in the summer, on a beach holiday weekday?    *****Five stars for the food-and I rarely rank Breakfast food as a 5 star meal.   *1 for the wait and crowds  ****4 for the service. The staff members are kind and cheery. Definitely, not a Snooze;",

    "text": "We are big brunch fans and living right off Restaurant Row we wanted to give Snooze a try.  It's always packed, must be a good sign.  First time we tried we waited over an hour then left, second time we came back a bit earlier, still waited over 45 minutes but wanted to try it.  Everything smelled incredible, looked amazing.  We asked for first available seating, we got to sit on the patio and it was a beautiful day.  I always ask the server what their favorite things are when I try a new place. Our server suggested a few things, one of them sounded really good, it had I think pulled pork and like a green chili or jalapeno bearnaise sauce, only problem was it comes with a poached egg on top.  I don't like poached eggs, \"No problem\" says our server, \"You can get the eggs any way you'd like.  I ask for over medium, and some silverware.  My friend also placed a to go order for her mom and asked that it be brought out with our check.  After about 30 minutes - still no silverware, but they brought out the to go order so it could get good and cold while we waited another 30 min for our food.  Mine came out with a poached egg.  Yeah...No.  I asked the server to take it back to the kitchen and just throw it in the microwave, no big deal.  She informed me there were no microwaves on the premises and they would have to start over.  Hmm ok.  My friend didn't want to start eating without me but I did not want her food to get cold so I told her to please go ahead, well except that we STILL HAD NO SILVERWARE after asking THREE TIMES.  I got up, went inside and grabbed 2 settings. It took another 18 minutes and this time when it came out it was even runnier than the poached egg!  The whites were still raw and runny.  Again, I asked the server to take it back and she verbally made a disgusted noise.  EXCUSE ME, WTF??!!  Sorry I don't want to get salmonella from your stupid raw eggs.  After being there for more than 2 hours, I had coffee (Which was decent) service that was completely unacceptable and our to go order was ice cold.  My friend said her pineapple upside down pancakes were pretty good, they looked delicious.  They did end up comping the entire meal and I had to go elsewhere for breakfast.  Never saw the manager - terribly poor form as they could have at MINIMUM come by the table.  I'm going to give them one more try, but this time if the service is equally wretched, well, it won't go down well, or quietly.  I'll keep you posted.",

Massive booths on the outside with entrance from either side of the booth, and half-moon tables with curved benches throughout the center portion of the restaurant.  They could have very easily made this a much more comfortable restaurant, however it appears they were more interested in a specific look versus functionality.  As far as the food goes, it was ok.  I had the Breakfast Burrito with chorizo and green chili sauce.  Very plain in flavor.  Sadly, I would say some of the local fast-food Mexican restaurants have much more flavorful breakfast burritos.  To be fair, I was with a large group and some of the group enjoyed their food more than me.  No one was overly impressed but some of them did feel their food and experience here was better than mine.",

    "text": "I tried to love Snooze Camelback.  We went three times.  The Bloody Mary is good, and it makes the 45 minute wait tolerable, but it's downhill from there.  For me, weekend breakfast out in the Valley usually means the following, for which Snooze Camelback is guilty on all counts:   --- Service is harried, and the check is dropped when you're just far enough from being finished for it to feel rude.  Amplifying the annoyance is that it's invariably offered with a disingenuous \"no rush, guys\". --- Most Valley breakfast restaurants I've been to have an open concept, which makes the cacophony of a packed house unbearable so early in the day. --- No Valley cook who prepares my eggs understands what EGGS OVER MEDIUM means.  We always thought the distinction between eggs OVER EASY (soft, possibly runny white with liquid yolk) and OVER MEDIUM (fully cooked white with yolk having the rich, unctuous viscosity of warm custard) was a given.  In the Valley, your real choices are over easy or over hard.  I have learned that having the cook remake it is an exercise in futility.  They either don't know or don't care to know.  SPECIFIC TO SNOOZE CAMELBACK:  On the last two outings, I had to send my dish back to the kitchen for being cold.  Forget any contrition or nicety regarding as much.  Your server will have too many tables to utter more than six words about fixing it.  The food is good, but not memorable.  Add that to the rest, and Snooze Camelback is wholly forgettable.",

Instead of English muffin, the base is a delicious layer of corn tortillas and it's stuffed with barbocoa and cheese and an amazing green chili hollandaise. Sooooo good! I also love the fact they let you mix and match different types, so you can really customize to your taste bud's delight! Don't forget to do the pancake flight!

Great service!  But definitely a wait.  Loved that they would text you when your table was ready!",

We came here on a Sunday morning and although it was pretty busy, we only waited about 30 minutes or so. The service was fast and professional. Our waiter was great with recommendations and suggestions. I had the pancake sampler and the sweet potato pancakes were AMAZING! My husband had the huevos rancheros and was not disappointed. So many of the menu items looked delicious, I can't wait to come back again soon!",

The tea came with no explanation of what kind it was and it definitely was too strong to be herbal so I didn't drink it. Never got the glass of ice. Ordered scrambled eggs, toast, hashbrowns and chicken \"sausage \". The latter was a misshapen patty that I couldn't eat. I tried two bites and it had an odd flavor so I skipped it. The eggs and toast were okay but only marmalade for the toast was served with it. No other options.   Had to wait quite awhile for the check and the place was NOT busy. My stomach was upset for about three hours afterwards. Not going back. Ever.",

    "text": "Retro meets modern twist on breakfast...where to start.. I arrived at 6.45, not realizing they open at 7am on the weekends, but the hostess was kind enough to open the doors early (which they did not have to do, even tho it was an unusual 35 degrees here in AZ)..I was actually going to have coffee & normally do not but it was an early morning.  Needless to say I did NOT have the coffee because as soon as I saw they offered loose leaf tea - sold...outside if a tea/coffee shop, how many restaurants offer loose leaf tea?...I also had AJ and was pleasantly surprised again that they brought unfiltered apple juice (bonus points in my book)...Withiut going into more detail than I already have, they have a variety of breakfast items but the specialty is pancakes even offering a custom variety order of 3 (thus u can get 3 different flavored pancakes), they didn't have banana pancakes on the menu, a bit bummed as I relayed that to the waitress but plenty of others to choose from...however after settling on a blueberry Danish pancake, the cook came out with a banana pancake drizzled with chocolate, caramel & powdered sugar! - extremely shocked and amazed that they made me A special pancake, which ease note that their \"large\" size pancakes are a meal in themselves-Delicious! You can also place HALF orders on almost any item on the menu, as I had a half order of the \"neat\" fen echo toast which was even better than the pancake....along with two eggs over easy and some rye toast, I always want more than I can eat....along with an extremely friendly, happy and informative wait staff, not overly or underly attentive...my only criticism is that I wish this place was closer to chandler! :)",

The service sometimes lacks, but hey, what small business doesn't lack in service when it is busy. Nothing to get bent outta shape over, usually just a little longer of a wait for your server to come back, which is totally fine considering the food is delicious! I love the o.m.g French toast, super good and light when I don't feel like being too full to run around all day. The pancake options are awesome, and they always have a pancake of the day. My personal favorite here, is the breakfast tacos, only problem I have is they are never consistent in portion. Sometimes there's a hefty amount of filling for the taco, sometimes it lacks a little, but like I said prior, the food here makes up for that either way. I give this place 5 stars. Great food, great atmosphere, good music, can't really complain. If you go on a weekend call before you head down to get on the waiting list. Sometimes it's about an hour and half long wait. Well worth it but prepare for it, and you won't have to be bummed out, you missed out on awesome food!",

    "text": "Pros: Happen'n place. Very nice layout both inside and out and kid friendly. Has an homage to the old diner with a soda fountain feel to it but with modern upscale elements. Tons of staff. Food was fresh. Cons: I informed the hostS at the front that I was walking by and intrigued so was a first timer and wanted to sit at the bar. The staff is all very young and didn't know to have a manager come by and ask how my meal was. No one ever asked. I ordered the Fall Greens which is supposed to be a spinach and arugula salad with roasted pears, goat cheese, crispy prosciutto, shaved fennel, candied walnuts and champagne vinaigrette (add a poached egg (2)). Pros: salad greens were fresh and delicious, goat cheese fine, candied walnuts not overpowering (possibly crushed and delivered in dressing?) perfect level of sweetness. Prosciutto was nice and crispy but tasted like it was half bacon. Cons: Pears were very under-ripe and not roasted at all! Inedible! Grilling might have carmelized them making them edible, but that requires time and forethought under the broiler or on the griddle. Very disappointing! I tasted no fennel (which I love) and I suspect it was not present. I ordered poached egg as extra and realized that it was $2 for one simply poached egg delivered on the side after my salad. I felt gauged. $2 for a simple poached egg on the side of a $10.50 salad is too much! Total assessment: Didn't deliver on roasted pears and fennel, cheated on prosciutto and egg. Salad and one egg with coffee: $16.25 without tip. Won't go back.",

When checking in the third time we were told they texted us six minutes ago. No text, hostess wrote the number down wrong. Hostess never came to find us, even though we'd asked her twice where we were in line. Do better hostess, it's your job to find us-esp when we've checked in. You know who we are. The girl bussing our table was super slow, no sense of urgency whatsoever. I felt badly for our server, who was walking into a hornets nest. But then she didn't bring us water for 10min, so that feeling disappeared quickly. But she was super friendly, so she deserves credit for trying to rescue our experience. The food arrived fairly quickly but in batches and was not hot. Can't explain that one. Egg whites and pineapple upside down pancake were late or forgotten. The manager never stopped by once, but to their credit we never asked for a deal of any kind either.  We're from Denver and the Snoozes there are much better than what we experienced in Phoenix. Note: Our family owns a steakhouse and knows what they're doing. This group failed us. Especially when a family waits so long. No accountability for our experience. Do better.",

Anytime I have company I take them here for delicious food and bloody Mary's or mimosas that are to die for. I would recommend this place to anyone and I can't wait for them to expand because I don't think I'll ever get enough of this place. Some of my favorites are the pot pie and Juan's tacos. I always add barbacoa and avacado to the tacos and ask for a side of the green chilli sauce. Also the OMG French toast is out if this world I always have to get a half order no matter how full I am. You can customize any order just how you want it without the servers being frustrated. It is actually encouraged and believe me anything is possible as long as your not in there when they are slammed. I've had them make me pancakes that have never been on the menu and it was hands down the best pancake of my life. The only reason this place has 4 start is because of the wait time. This place is worth the wait and if it wasn't great quality they wouldn't have 1-2 hour waits on the weekends. If you don't like that then go during the week or later in the day because that is the one thing they cannot control. I would also recommend sitting at the bar. You get great service no matter who is behind the bar and every barista that has taken care if me has been extremely personable which ices the cake for my personal experience.",

Not necessarily the worst thing but it comes off impersonal. Maybe that's just their way. My Eggs Benedict was not correct so they took my plate away then removed the wrong Bennie and brought back my original plate so I could eat what was left. Later, they brought the replacement Benedict on a separate plate after I was pretty much finished with my meal. Again, not the worse thing but they should have just re-fired the whole plate. Sort-of cheesy. The last thing that concerns me about Snooze is the noise level! This place is loud!! Like 98-100db loud (sound App) . That's the same as a jet plane or a chainsaw. If we hadn't already ordered our food we would have left. I looked up what it says about these noise levels and the employees should only have about 2-4 hours exposure max. My ears were ringing after we left. If you want a nice quiet breakfast forget about Snooze. Foods great but there is a slight downside. At least for us.",

Onto breakfast!  The menu is different, very different.  Be prepared to expand your breakfast horizons and I mean that in a most awesome way!

The coffee, while good, is not worthy of the two page slightly pretentious story of how it came to be on our table.  So...I had a sweet potato pancake with pecans and caramel syrup that was like revisiting Thanksgiving only better, and two totally different, totally awesome versions of eggs Benedict.  My wife had two other versions of the Benedict and we literally wiped the plates.  I'd be here all day describing them so you'll just have to go and try it.  We will definitely be back!",

Snooze is ALL the craze and it is in San Diego in both locations there and I am still in awe and curious as to why? Sure it is breakfast and the name is catchy, but what gives to make it worth a 2 hour wait? I do not have a reason, wish I did because I would wait the 2 hours for something spectacular about it but the omelettes are skimpy and the price of 2 pieces of bacon was way too much, it was not a fancy pig or anything. It needs to simply have better food to match it's great service. I recommend sitting at the bar top, always my go-to in crowded places, especially crowded at a place like snooze even at 9am on a Saturday when you think brunch is suppose to have that 2 hour wait at 11am, when many people pull themselves out of bed and lazily approach a good ole saturday.",

I passed on the candied walnuts & coconut that usually come with it & good thing cuz it was really sweet. Also comes with banana. $8 for a small bowl, kinda steep. Getting it already sweetened is like ordering coffee & it arrives with sugar already heaped in. Menu looks great & love they have booze too so I'll come back & try again but will order something different.",

I understand they are getting ready to open a place in Tempe. I can only imagine what the wait time will be like there.  They also carry a few beers but the choices don't make sense. I'm sorry but who wants to drink a big IPA for breakfast, they'd be better off selling San Tan's Mr. Pineapple, Papago's Orange Blossom or Sonoran's Vanilla.",

My 10-year-old is super-picky and even he said his blueberry pancake was \"very, very delicious.\" They served fresh-squeezed apple cider with his kid's meal! My chilaquile Benedict was amazing, but even better was the fact that you can mix and match! So, I had half chilaquile and half Havana Benny- best breakfast ever! We don't eat meat, but they offer substitutes and the waitress suggested avocado with the Havana Benny- great combination! There are just so many wonderful choices on the menu- it is tough to decide! Phoenix, you are so fortunate to have a Snooze!",

This was absolutely the worst experience we've ever had at any Snooze location. Above all the service was terrible. Our waiter didn't bring us water and acted annoyed that we were there. Snooze has always stood out as having the friendliest and best service around. The waiter also knowingly got my order wrong and didn't change it or offer anything. At the Snooze in Denver they always bring you a free pancake for a long wait or messing up your order. The terrible service overshadowed the delicious food.",

On my last visit I got the stuffed French toast. I was disappointed by the thin slices of bread used for the toast. They should use texas toast or challach to make the dish better. The filling was also lacking in flavor. On a previous visit, I tried hash browns that were baked and seemed almost raw in the middle- a very starchy potato grainy taste. I would not order those again. Overall, an ok place. I want to try the pancakes that they are famous for.",

The wait was an hour long on Sunday morning, but it's a popular place so can't ding them for that. The coffee was really good--you can read the long story about how it's from their partner farm in Guatemala or you can just drink and enjoy. Our group got a variety of breakfast items--French Toast, Corned Beef Hash, traditional Eggs Benedict, Chilaquiles Benedict, Scrambled Eggs. Our kind server also brought us out a complimentary speciality pancake, which was tasty. Everything was on point. The table was silent; everyone was enjoying their meal. I had the traditional eggs benedict (Ham Benedict III). The ham was shaved, which I surprisingly liked. The hollandaise was also light and not overpowering and not too thick. It's a long wait, but worth it.",

The wifey is gluten intolerant so they have gluten free toast and pancakes she loves. It's not on the menu, but ask for the cinnamon roll pancake... just do it. We would get it as an appetizer!

They take your cell phone number and send you a text when your table is almost ready, so you can explore the local shops while you're waiting!  The atmosphere is awesome - very cool decor, super friendly staff, and an open-air concept. I loved everything about this place from the moment I saw it!   After our allotted wait time, we were seated at an outside table - which I was happy about because the weather was just beautiful! (And I don't get many outdoor eating opportunities in my part of the land this time of year.)  Our waiter was very friendly and helped us quickly. I started with a hot chocolate - my favorite! It was okay, but tasted kind of like warm chocolate milk. Looks delicious, though! ;)   I ordered the Breakfast Pot Pie with a Candy Apple Pancake instead of hashbrowns - great decision! The crust to the pot pie was lighter than I was expecting, which was a little bit of a bummer. But it was a nice compliment to the heavy gravy, which was delicious. The gravy has big chunks of sausage and is perfectly flavorful. And the sunny side up egg on top is the perfect touch!   It's funny to me they call the Candy Apple Pancake just that, because it's more an \"Apple Pie Pancake.\" Seriously so good, though! There were just the right amount of apples and topping, and the mascarpone was a perfect touch.   The two, plus the hot chocolate, had me more than full! (Which was good, because adding the pancake made it a little pricey.)   Another place I'd be a regular at if I lived around here! Yummmmmm",

I hate breakfast, and I couldn't eat here; went because my girlfriend loves breakfast, so she chose to eat here. Their menu is like every stupidly hip breakfast place; the same dozen dishes with some different shit sprinkled on top. Might have settled on a sandwich, but you can't get a normal sandwich side (i.e. fries), because apparently that capability is beyond that of their kitchen. Nothing even remotely appealing for me.  She ordered some sort of egg benedict dish with tomatoes for a side. Thought that was an odd choice to make, much less be offered, but whatever. After looking at the pics of other people's food, it's a crapshoot as all the sides look pretty disappointing. Overpriced drinks and a crap selection of beers, too.  Her dish was pathetic. Two smallish eggs on two pieces of cocktail-party sized toasted rye, with 4 thin slices of a pithy, white tomato on the side. For $11.50. That's it... For $6 this would have been good value, for near double that, it was by-the-book wallet rape. She commented that everything was fine, but nothing better than what you would find at a breakfast buffet in Vegas.   Service was nothing special, and everything was slow. Slow to get drinks, slow to get food (nearly 20 minutes for 2 eggs!?!), slow to get the check. The place wasn't super slammed, either.   I guess some people are into this sort of experience and overpriced food. I'll just continue not wasting my time ever again.",

Be aware that the menu is limited and doesn't offer all things typical at a breakfast place, such as skillets, but you can customize to your hearts content.  If you are waiting, go hang out in the back of the restaurant. They will text you when your table is almost ready.  You can also go hang out at Whole Foods or Trader Joe's.",

    "text": "Very disappointed. Shared my bacon with my husband. Ordered standard bacon and because it appears to be marinted, it's uniform in color.  One end of two maybe three pieces of the bacon was cooked and one end was mushy and now I realize it was completely not cooked.  Like it had hung over the edge of a griddle and got half cooked and still raw on one end. Didn't sent it back because we had waited so long to be seated and were starving and because it was uniform in color, I didn't realize how uncooked it was. It was also pretty much room temperature on the mushy end.  What a mistake. Within an hour and a half of leaving, we BOTH got stomach cramps and hit with watery diarrhea. I am 100% positive we got sick from eating that bacon and I'm 100% sure because we each ate a piece of it (I gave it to my husband because I didn't want a second pice of mushy bacon and he never turns down my shared bacon) and we both got sick. Snooze for us was more like Ooze. Don't need to go back.",

Very courteous servers, quick kitchen, and tasty food as always.  My favorite is the blueberry Danish pancakes.  They can get sweet after awhile, but it's amazing with the lemon zest filling.",

(I had to take off a star for the crazy wait times, though that is expected at all the locations.) The wait is always long, typically at least an hour or longer. If you plan ahead and go after 10am though, you can wander next door to Nordstrom Rack while you wait. No downside there. Or, go early and beat the rush. It is always worth the wait though.  The Spuds Deluxe is a killer stack of hashbrowns that you can load up with all your favorite things, bacon, green chile, cheese, whatever makes you happy. I could eat their gravy with a spoon, so the Pot Pie is a favorite as well. The different Benedict options are pretty amazing as well. My current favorite is whichever one comes with the killer balsamic reduction.   For sweet options, a pancake flight is a great way to try several things at once. Although, be warned most of them are solid desserts and the pancake of the day is typically the sweetest. The basic French toast (isn't really all that basic) it's my favorite thing in the sweet category.   Basically, you can't go wrong with Snooze, just plan a full morning for your brunch and don't expect to be hungry for lunch later.",

I came here with my brother and he had a combination of two different eggs benedict (awesome that you can combine two different ones into a single dish) and a pineapple pancake. Every single part of the meal was fantastic.  To top it off the coffee was served hot and the service was on point with recommendations and timeliness. Definitely recommend if you can stand to wait at least 10-15 minutes even if it's not a busy weekend morning - this place gets packed quick, and for good reason!",

In my opinion, there are some things here that are not worth waiting for like the omelette which is tiny and uninteresting. The eggs benedict, however, is fantastic. They have a few types of bennies and the veggie one I tried was delicious. If you have a sweet tooth for breakfast, they have massive sweet ooey gooey pancakes which come in flavors like cinnamon roll and chocolate peanut butter too that are bomb. Service here is excellent and the atmosphere is really cute- almost has a -1960s pop vibe. I would say that Snooze is definitely worth a visit depending on your taste in breakfast/brunch.",

All of the Pancakes were amazeballs and the Breakfast Sandwiches were made with such fresh tasty ingredients and they weren't greasy or sloppy like a lot of Breakfast Sandwiches. I also really enjoyed the Hash Browns, crispy and also not greasy so yay.   It's pretty cute in here, the service was great, food came out at a reasonable pace and it was clean. If you're trying to eat healthy, although this place tastes like it uses fresh ingredients, their offerings aren't too healthy; and really you have to come here for the unhealthy tasting goodness anyway.  Oh and P.S Houstonians who see this review, there are plans to open one here soon!",

She said no, had to order separate.  We placed our order and I ordered my 3.50 pancake.  We had great service for the first half of our experience. Our food came out and my pancake was raw inside! The batter was liquidy!! I showed the waitress the issue and she promptly took it back to \"show the cooks\".  30 minutes later...she returns ...my coffee still empty...acting surprised that someone else hadn't brought my pancake back out .  Then 15 min after that...she returns again saying they were just making sure it was fully cooked.  Still no coffee refill offered.  At that point, we had finished our meals! It was clear she had forgotten to follow up on my order to begin with and thought lying to me ...twice ... Would pacify me.  I told her to forget the pancake...and we also had to get up and ask another server for our own to go box.  Truly she was clueless about the entire situation ....very disappointed and i won't be returning.",

Overall, the decoration and vibe if the restaurant were nice. However, the service was very slow. It took about 25 to 30 minutes to get our food, our waitress barely checked on us, and our drinks stayed empty the majority of the time. I agree with other reviewers that it appears that their sweeter items may be better than their savory. We had the Sandwich I Am and the Green Eggs and Hamwich. The green eggs and hamwich was a good size but not too flavorful and overpowered by the spinach. The ham on it was tasty. The other sandwich was average. We had the side of fruit which was extra and pretty small but okay. We had a side if hash browns which were good. They did offer me a beverage to go which was nice. Overall it was okay but nothing I would wait in line for. There are better breakfast options within a few blocks of here.",

We arrived around 11:00am & wait was about 60-75 mins for 2 people...crazy! We put our name down & went on some errands. They'll text you 5 mins before your table is ready. I got the text, checked in & for some reason waited an additional 20 mins. Apparently they forgot about us so we asked to be seated at the bar. To make up for the wait they gave us a free giant caramel apple pie pancake...it was insanely yummy. I'm not a fan of Apple pie but I would order this pancake again. For cocktails we ordered the spicy Bloody Mary (with habanero & jalepeno infused vodka) & spicy gazpacho Bloody Mary (with cucumber, garlic & bell pepper infused vodka). Both were delicious! As for food, we ordered the chilaquiles Benedict & Bella Bella Benny Benedict (with proscuitto, arugula & balsamic glaze). Food & flavors were incredible! Everything on their food & drink menus are unique & there's a good variety of brunch items. The girls at the bars were super nice & attentive and the restaurant has a cool, hip, trendy vibe/atmosphere. Would definitely come back to try other brunch items & would recommend it to our friends...just have to keep in mind of the crazy wait time.",

We ate outside on the patio (although it is a little chilly for some of the locals outside in the morning in February), enjoyed great service. We didn't take advantage of the full bar, but loved that they have it: I had the regular drip decaf coffee, not expecting it to be as robust as I make my own, but was happily surprised: it rocked!  You could even sit at the bar for breakfast, which a number of people were doing.  It is fragrant with breakfast smells and has the hum of a successful enterprise beloved by its patrons.",

We decided to sit on the patio since the music was loud and my friend couldn't hear with that much background sound.  The full bar provided a ginger beer and vodka drink that was delicious.  Heaters for chilly days are available but today it was not needed given the warm day. Our brunch was sweet potato pancakes with caramel sauce and walnuts and an eggs benedict over palenta with hash browns.  They arrived a bit late as did the coffee, but the wait and a good stiff drink made the extra time fly by. Ingredients are fresh and flavors are excellent, this food is exceptional. Snooze has plenty of young people and a very kind and efficient staff that keeps pace with a constant steady business in the middle of the day. The location is perfect with a high-end grocery store and a bulk store around the back of the mall.  After the meal you can walk around the renovated mall and shop to your heart's content.",

The personal service we received as a group of 7 guys who had a very long weekend went above and beyond . If you read this review and don't go your a fool this was by far the best breakfast I've had and ranks near the top for service . The Manager Chris I believe sorry if that's wrong bearded guy working the front came to our table welcomed us told me about his restaurant like it was his own. This guy is a keeper loves what he does and it showed great great great job hope I can get back there again soon maybe the ones in California near me can be visited sooner .",

I mean its breakfast, generally a meal that seldom finds itself living up to your expectation, probably because its a meal that the average person can do well enough at home. With that being said Snooze is worth every penny. The food is excellent and the creative pancake options are to die for. Its easy to find yourself eating a lot here because the portions are a great size and its also hard to pass up trying things like pineapple upside down pancakes. This place is great, the music tends to be a bit much and often way too loud to deal with early in the morning for me, but the food is worth the discomfort.

They have a location in Austin I'd like to try but I fear the parking lot is cramped. Enjoy.",

I love that everything is customizable from selecting two different combinations of eggs Benedict to enjoying a pancake flight with three different flavors.   My dining partners and I had the mmm mimosa, michelada, Chile verde Benedict, and pancake flight with the bourbon street pumpkin pancakes, upside down pineapple pancakes, and chocolate almond (flavor of the day). The upside down pineapple pancakes continue to be my favorite. I also loved the crunchiness of the chocolate almond.   Service was fantastic.",

I came on  Friday morning and it was pretty packed. I had to wait about 15 mins for a table for one , since the bar area was also full. I ordered the Mountain Mule cocktail. It was light and refreshing. You could tell there were fresh ingredients used. I didnt even taste the alcohol!   I ordered the breakfast pot pie. It was really tasty. The sausage gravy has a nice hint of herbs, and just the right consistency. The crust was phyllo dough and it was nice & flaky. I did have to send my entree back due to it being on the cold side, but that was a quick fix and worth the wait. I hope they bring this to Vegas.. it would be perfect for those needing to recoup from partying the night before on the strip!",

Just hard to enjoy to fullest when you are sweating because ya gotta eat outside.  Thank god for misters!  Add a fan and the patio is tolerable and you can focus on the food.",

The place was upbeat, the wait staff was awesome and accommodating. The eatery was tidy and bright.   I ordered the AMAZING pineapple upside down pancake  with hash browns and bacon. I am so glad that I only ordered one pancake because I barely finished my meal. All of it was absolutely delicious. The orange juice even tasted freshly squeezed.   I cannot wait until my next visit to try some other options. I now also understand the name Snooze.....it is exactly what you will want to do after finishing up a meal there. The best breakfast/brunch spot I have encountered in a looooooong time!  I'm certainly a certified fan now!!!! Try it people you won't regret the decision.",

The Benny Duo Benedict, Snooze Classic a d Corn Beef Hash were all winner selections.  I loved the atmosphere!  Great breakfast/brunch selections",

I got the BRAVOcado toast breakfast which, from my recollection, involved avocado and some onion/tomato mixture on top of some tasty bread with eggs on top. It was very good. The atmosphere has a vintage-ish vibe to it and had some nice music playing. I take five stars on yelp very seriously and am only not giving Snooze a full 5 stars because nothing truly blew me away. The service was nice but nothing to remember it by. The food was good, but I don't think it was absolutely the best I've ever had. Overall, this is a good restaurant with good food.",

Then you order it and think..... really? Someone went to culinary school to learn THIS?? I could've made the exact same thing!   Well.... this is NOT what Snooze is about. These people literally said \"how can we make an amazing breakfast that's DIFFERENT that'll make them come back?\" (Trust me, I was there in the meeting)  Anyway the stuff they serve here is NOT something you can whip up on your own! Sure, u can quit your day job and not work and then you can duplicate their memorable breakfast. I can also repair my own engine and paint my house (I can't do either) but do I want to?? Heck no!  So if you wanna eat here, get ready to be blown away and be OPEN MINDED! Their blending of things might not sound so appealing on their paper menu but oh boy are your taste buddies awarded.   Now just please don't be boring and order scrambled eggs with bacon. They do that too but you can get that stuff anywhere!  Be well, Snoozers!!",

Like Allie S. says, if we are going to be Arcadia folks, we better start brunching!   Everything here was amazing, but I am going to start with the best thing:   Chocolate Chip Pancake. I'm kicking myself for not taking a photo, but I guess I just couldn't wait. The pancake was crispy on top.. like how do I even explain it?.. this is a stretch but it was almost like creme brulee. Seriously incredible, best pancake I have ever eaten, and that's saying something.   We also had the ham eggs benedict. the most classic style, I think it was called Ham Benedict III. It was also the best benedict I've ever eaten, but not as unique in yumminess as the pancake. It's not fair to compare a benedict to a pancake, I realize, but still that pancake... anyways,  Finally, we got the Breakfast Pot Pie. I thought it was kinda weird, but I only had a bite. Here's my bfs description: \"Flaky, like a pot pie. But not really. I think I was just way more into the homemade chicken sausage\" - which brings me to my next topic,  Homemade Chicken Sausage. Again, not up my alley AT ALL, but he was in heaven. That and the fresh squeezed OJ. He was like \"I don't even ask if it's fresh squeezed. I just order it and if it's not fresh squeezed I know the food is going to be a joke.\" I guess he was right though, because the juice was delish, and the food was oMAHHHGAHHH good.",

We were VERY excited to try this place.  This is an outstanding breakfast restaurant.  Service is terrific.  The manager even threw in an extra pancake because he had to sit us at a table for 2, instead of at a bigger table.    The food is amazing.  I had the pancake flight and it was sooooo good! I recommend the pineapple upside down pancake hands-down.  Plus, they have a ping pong table.  AWESOME.  The only thing that isn't great is the wait.  On the weekend you have to be very lucky to avoid an hour wait.  They don't do any call-aheads or anything like that, so I would say just wait until you can go during the week to avoid the craziness.  ENJOY!",

The retro decor was a nice surprise and wait staff was attentive and very helpful on this our first visit. I had the OMG French Toast and it was very delicious. So delicious that I forgot to snap a picture  of my plate before I indulged in the sweet goodness of the dish.  The toast was moist, not overdone and full of flavor. I also noticed that it was just the right amount of sweetness for my tastes.  To drink, I enjoyed a latte.  I forgot which one exactly but it was pleasant and just as good. I enjoyed this visit and will definitely visit them again!  I only hope that they open a location in San Antonio soon!",

Food was great. Service was attentive yet unobtrusive. Prices were more than fair for the quality of food served. They have doggie bowls for water if you're there with Fido.

    "text": "When I go to a fancy breakfast place, I look for reasons to even be there instead of Ihop, Denny's, etc because A - its usually more expensive and B - its hard to improve on eggs over easy and bacon and these places are solid.    I was going to get the breakfast pot pie but from the description it seemed less like a pie, more like a biscuit and gravy dish with a pie crust in place of biscuit.  I'm glad I asked because that's exactly what it was.  So I got the BLT instead.  Yea, it had a fancy pesto mayo on it and some kinda soft cheese but other than that, its your basic BLT and regular bacon (described as soft belly bacon).  It was good, but not good enough that I'd ever order this again.  I tried my friend's 3-ingredient omelet (sausage, cheddar and mushroom) and it was kind of dense and flavorless.  The hash browns are better than I thought they'd be, as they were shredded potatoes in the shape of a cylinder with only the top part crispy and I usually like these fried parts the best.  Nothing really special about them besides the shape.  Really, the only thing I've ever heard people rave about this place is the pancake flight deal so I won't fully dismiss the place til I've tried a pancake.  I probably won't be clamoring to be back anytime soon though.",

The wait time for a table on a Saturday was not very long at all, although ultimately we were packed into a single booth. The service was by far the most disappointing aspect of this visit. She was not very friendly or attentive to our dining party. Often our coffee and water glasses would remain empty for extended periods of time. Not once did she come to our table to ask to see if our food orders were correct of if we needed anything else.  For the food itself, each of the savory dishes ordered were okay at best. I ordered the breakfast burrito, which was nothing special, but surprisingly spicy. The group shared a flight of sweet pancakes. These pancakes were the highlight of the dining experience. I would highly recommend ordering from the back of the menu when you come in for a visit.",

I had a vanilla latte. Very well done everything had beautiful presentation and equally delicious sauces to go with it.  We waited about 30 minutes to get seated but absolutely worth the wait.",

The menu is what you might expect for a breakfast place, but what caught my eye was the Ham Benedict, served with two English muffins topped with shaved hickory smoked ham, perfectly poached Niman Ranch Cage Free Eggs and smoked cheddar hollandaise.   As much as I love egg Benedict I almost hate to order it as it mostly gets served with a day old english muffins and gloopy hollandaise.  Not at Snooze, the muffin was perfectly fresh and buttery, poached egg cooked to perfection and the hollandaise was delicious.    I am Not sure what is up with the mixed reviews here, but I am sure if Snooze is not to your liking, you will always be welcomed at Denny's.  Snooze is a welcome addition to the Town and Country Shopping Center.",

Whether you are a pancake breakfast glutton or a hung over savory breakfast bum like me Snooze will have everything to get that morning fix.   Service here is just as good as the food. We had a couple mix ups with drink orders, but that never bothers me.

Be ready to wait but it is not Snooze's fault.  People love to linger here and linger and linger!  Food could have been warmer when served. I'll go back again, more to try.",

    "text": "Bangkok Bloody Mary. Do it. They are delicious.   After trying and failing to get into Snooze on a weekend, we finally made it on a Tuesday morning. There was still a little bit of a wait, but we managed to swing a couple seats at the bar where we stayed to eat. They generally seat the bar as part of the list, but it being a Tuesday and the wait not being very long, the bartender put in a good word and got us some menus. So here is my first bit of advice: if you want to go here on a weekend, make the time for it. Don't arrive starving. The place is regularly packed and on a wait and the food does not come out quickly. Take your time and enjoy.   I read a lot of great things about the pancakes at Snooze, but when it comes down to it, I am more a savory breakfast type of girl. I went with the eggs Benedict. I could not decide between the Chilaquiles Benedict and the Havana Benny, and so it was a very good thing that they do half orders! The Havana Benny ended up being my favorite; I found the chilaquiles a little bit under spiced for my taste. The hash browns were delicious, though I think the best thing about them was the presentation.   Overall, the experience was excellent and the bartender went above and beyond to make sure we got the right drinks and the right food.",

We got there at 9am on a Sunday and still had about a 30 minute wait, however, they send you a text when your table is ready - so you are able to actually leave the premises. The inside is soooooooo freaking adorable, and everyone we encountered was very friendly.  About 10 minutes after we place our order our server arrived with a complimentary Nutella Banana Pancake that was huge and for our table to share.  She just showed up with it! One of our brunchers is 7 months pregnant, and you would have thought she won the lottery.  I'm not a sweet breakfast person, but this was honestly delish.  Everyone enjoyed their meals, the prices are beyond reasonable, and we all decided we need to make this a regular outing on top of our weekly brunches.   OH and I love that they have so many vegetarian options.  Honestly - so happy they opened in PHX and are just around the corner from my home.",

The not-so-good: the bottom line for me is that this place is just not delicious enough to justify the ever-present wait time. There are so many great brunch places in the midtown area that aren't chains and you won't wait this long. I am willing to wait for something extraordinary, but Snooze just isn't it. I have never had anything at Snooze that was worth the wait time. The food is mediocre. Also, the music- if anyone remembers \"Jock Jams\" from the 90's, that type of music was playing on loop at top volume the last time I was in there. Super obnoxious and a lot to take in the morning.",

We tried a few different benedict dishes and they even let you substitute different ones.   I am unlikely to return anytime soon though secondary to the terrible experience actually getting a table which allowed us access to said great food.  Briefly, we were told 30 minutes to wait, 45 minutes later they say 'you are next', then proceed to seat four additional parties (same size of our own).

    "text": "I went to Snooze several months ago, around when it first opened. I totally spaced on writing a review. D'oh! But I remember everything so well, I'll just go ahead and write one anyway. 4 months later. Gonna be super accurate.  I went here with 2 other friends of mine during peak brunch hour. i.e., when yo' ass rolls out of bed on a Saturday around 10:30AM. It was pretty crowded, but we only ended up waiting about 20 minutes or so. I just stood outside and snapped pictures of their awesome sign. Such pretty typography + signage (insert nerdy laugh-snort). Once inside and seated, I became increasingly impressed by their fantastic brand consistency. Everything felt so...cool and retro. What the Hell guys, why didn't you hire me as your graphic designer!? I would've traded my work for food. Anyway, our orders were promptly taken by extremely friendly staff. It DID take an overly long time for our food to arrive, but they hadn't been open very long and it was ridiculously busy, so I wasn't too surprised by that. Once the food came, I snarfed it down and washed food particles away with some delicious mimosas. I don't have a massive appetite usually, but I felt their dishes were perfectly proportionate. Just enough food to fill you up, but not too much to put you into a brunch food coma for the rest of the afternoon. I wish I could recall exactly what I ate, but I'm writing this review 4 months later, so my memory is a bit wonky. Oh, remember a few sentences ago when I said our food took a while to arrive? They felt the need to make up for that by gifting us a free pancake that tasted like A FREAKIN' SAMOA. Yeah, I forgive you. Like immediately. Overall, everything was really tasty and appropriately priced. Staff was genuinely kind and really easy to interact with. It gave me the opportunity to crack a bunch of cheesy jokes with our server.   I haven't been back since, mostly because I just eat a banana for breakfast when I wake up in the morning. But next time I get HONGRAY for some brunch, I'll definitely hit this place up. Plus, I can ride my bicycle there! Wow dude!  bye",

If you sit outside make sure to go around the side where the misters are. Coming from the east coast I consider myself a bit of an eggs Benedict aficionado and these were some of the best I have ever had. In addition the service was excellent, no small compliment coming from me. I never waited for a refill or wanted anything, every time I needed something there was a server already asking me if they could help.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I AM a fan of SNOOZE - (and for all I have to say you may want to take a snooze- or heck, you may even snooze before you're done reading...but) I have been to SNOOZE a myriad of times - and GENERALLY the food/service is outstanding. But today....eh not so much. Today is my daughter's birthday. She wanted to celebrate with a breakfast instead of the traditional dinner...and she wanted SNOOZE. (YES!- I thought to myself...love Snooze). I went online to see if I was able to make a reservation. Unfortunately, no. No reservations are accepted. No worries, my hubby and I will get there when they open and get a table for 12. Well, we got there about 7:20ish and they were already getting busy. Good thing we got there early, right? That really didn't matter, although they(Snooze peeps) were kind enough to let us wait by the window, they really didn't want to hold a table for that many for that long a time. People were to come about 8am - which was about 40 minutes from then. When I asked if they use the tables, would we still be able to get seated when everyone arrived. I was told the turn around is usually about an hour so  there would be a few minute wait. (WAIT? That's why we arrived early - - so we could get a table  large enough to accommodate our family). Okay...I didn't want to be unreasonable or worse a  B-WORD - so I said...well, okay....well, see how this works. If timing were to be on our side, the tables should come free before everyone arrived. EH..not so much. That's okay... I DO realize the world doesn't revolve around our family. SO.....we waited. And waited!  .....and after asking  (twice) if they could give an estimate on how much longer we'd be waiting ----well, they were kind and said it looks as if the people were getting ready to leave. We waited....and waited some more....until  finally, yes!, we are able to be seated. The server, whose name I did not see, already seemed stressed....(trust me, I know stress, so I can spot it!) He was quick to ask if we wanted anything to drink. Coffee, coffee, coffee is our reply... Several minutes later he comes with a dark beverage that should be hot - but isn't and should be coffee - but it is not. When we ask if we could have some hot coffee instead of the tea that was brought to us, he argued a tiny bit and said, \"no, it's coffee, it came from the same section\" - I was a bit perplexed and honestly, I really did not want to be a B-WORD but I didn't understand the \"same section\" comment nor did I grasp the thought that he didn't get that if everyone said it tasted like tea, why he didn't just say, I'm sorry, I'll bring another cup. He repeated the \"Same section\" comment and then said something about maybe we weren't used to their particular coffee bean. You know they grind it themselves (sarcasm noted). While he was trying to figure out the coffee/tea thang, many minutes have past...we still haven't ordered and quite frankly I was wishing we had gone elsewhere. While we did eventually  get real coffee, that wasn't before he told us that he tasted it and \"it IS coffee.\" Implying, I suppose that we don't know the difference between coffee & tea. I assure you, you don't need to be a coffee AND tea connoisseur, to know the difference! Okay, we order, he starts at the other end of the table...no problems here....until, he gets to my dad, who is sitting next to me. My dad is 84 years and, as people might be at that age a bit grumpy & hard of hearing- oh yeah, and set in his ways. He has every right. He doesn't like butter or anything that tastes like butter so after he ordered I said to the server just that - please don't cook in butter...perhaps basted? The server, said to me, rather curtly, he wants to hear it from him(my dad) because too many people ordering will surely make it wrong and he wants to be sure he gets what he wants. He actually reprimanded me for speaking on my dads behalf. He very well dismissed me and only wanted to speak to my dad. I KNOW this as True, because, well the server told me so. HELLO! I was aghast that this server would say this to any customer. I then asked him if he were having a bad day, because it seems as if he was annoyed before he started taking our order. I was trying to break the ice but he wanted no part of this. He quickly - and I mean quickly(!) dismissed me & my comments and said that  (again) the coffee was is the same section. Okay maybe this is some kind of restaurant lingo that I am not privy to - however, he seemed bothered by the coffee tea thang. By this time we were happy with our coffees and just wanted to celebrate the birthday. Fast forward - we get the ordering done, they brought the food out in a more than normal time frame - but given there were 12 of us, that is to be expected.   I have to wrap this up, It's too long. Basically, some of the food was cold (maybe it was in the \"same section\" but they did take it off the bill. Would I go back? Yes, but not with a large group.",

You might think with that in mind you will have to pay with an arm and a leg, but that is not necessarily the case. A full Rueben sandwich is basically $10, and it's fantastic!   Additionally the customer service is outstanding. Angela, our waitress, was amazing and very upbeat. She even gave us a free dish of their secret pancakes!  Definitely a place to try at least once!

    "text": "I came here a few weeks ago with a friend. I loved it, and when I love a food place, I bring other friends. With another friend, I returned today. She was irate with me because, in her words, \"this is the *best* food I've eaten in 4 months\".   I can't believe I'm saying this because I love their food so much, but it's even more delicious than Butters/Butterfields. Who thought that could be possible?   Both times, my friend and I have shared the following: Juan's Tacos, the option to order (2)  1/2 orders of Egg Benedict (the name of it isn't coming to mind), and the Pancake Flight. The Pancake Flight lets you sample any 3 of their fancy schmancy pancakes.   My favorite really is the Juan's Tacos; they're probably the best tacos I've eaten some I moved to Phoenix 10 yrs ago. You get 3 opened faced tacos on soft tortillas(ask them for the Cholula sauce). It comes with a grilled jalapeno pepper, and this hash brown \"muffin\". It's a hash brown that's about 1 in thick, and shaped into a perfect cylinder. The hashbrowns are so good, you'll close your eyes as you're savoring them.  For a place in a posh area like the Biltmore, the prices are incredibly decent; about $9-$12/entree. It's incredibly popular. Today the wait was 45 min. After I put my name down, I heard the hostess tell another person that seating at the bar, and the side of the bar was open...first come first serve. Luckily for us, I was able to snake 2 chairs at the bar. Our wait time was cut in 1/2.",

We were seated on the back patio in the shade and it was actually pretty nice! Our server promptly provided a water bowl for bubba and took our orders. We both made a couple of changes to our order and the server was happy to accommodate us. I had the egg scramble with bacon and sub'd the toast for a sweet potato pancake with blueberries. Food came out quickly and was delicious. Honestly I don't know what else to say. It was a great meal with great service. 5 stars!",

It's fancy food in a casual setting, so you get the best of both worlds!  The food is great and there is a wide variety of inventive eggs benedict and pancakes to choose from, so you're all set whether you like sweet or savory for your morning meal. The coffee is good, and the servers are nice. Sometimes service is slow when they're really busy, but anyone who genuinely complains about that is a terd.  This place is also exceptionally vegetarian friendly, which I find is a tendency among breakfast joints, but it's still worth noting.   I've never had the cocktails here, so I can't speak to them, but I'm sure they're also delicious.  tl;dr You'll drop a pretty penny for breakfast/brunch/lunch at Snooze, but it's familiar food that's done well, and so it's well worth it. If you have friends visiting that appreciate good food but want to stick to something they know and keep it casual, Snooze is one of your best bets in the Valley.",

Bright, cheery, and clean, it's what you'd expect from an upscale brunch chain.   Coffee was great and refills plentiful. Plenty of options, savory and sweet. The omelets were done well, and the hashbrowns were...unique. In a good way. Portions weren't grossly large, which I actually appreciate in a restaurant. Quality, not quantity.  Server was a bit of a space cadet and service was pretty slow, but it may have been a one-off, so I can't knock the place for that.",

I've been wanting to give this place a try, but haven't had a chance. I love how cute and modern it is I really enjoyed the decor to the silverware. Also I noticed the hip hop they played which I found kind of funny because it definitely did not fit their customer base here. However this music earned them an extra star lol. I love old school hip hop/r&b.   We were greeted by the hostess and got seated pretty quickly, that's another thing the employees here are like a bunch of little speedy gonzalezes no joke! We were a group of six. But with 3 6 foot men, yet they chose to sit us down in this little round table in the center of the restaurant. It was pretty tight!   I ordered the huevos rancheros with their pancake of the day it was some bacon with jalapeno concoction. Which by the way was super delicious! They get all of their food from local farms which is a HUGE plus in my book! I only eat bacon of the source is a local farm.   Their menu wAs great pretty to the point! Everyone in my group was happy with their meal, but that pancake and that bacon was the biggest talk on our table! Our server was friendly funny and enthusiastic oh and quick!   Almost forgot to mention their jelly and coffee-yes yes yes!!!! All in all my only downfall was the small table lol but we made it work. I will most definitely come back here!",

    "text": "Items Selected: Coffee Pancake Flight: Pineapple Upside Down - Buttermilk pancakes with caramelized pineapple chunks, housemade vanilla creme anglaise and cinnamon butter Drunken Punk'n - Our homemade pumpkin with a cream cheese filling, topped with bourbon infused maple syrup, sweet cream drizzle and maple spiced pepitas Blueberry Danish - Buttermilk pancakes topped with blueberry coulis, sweet cream and almond streusel surrounding a center of lemony cream cheese filling Sister Fig's French Toast - Fresh Brioche griddled with fig preserves and Tallegio cheese and topped with blood orange syrup, caramel and walnut streusel  One of several Arizona locations spawned by a chain out of Colorado, Snooze \"An AM Eatery\" was visited for early brunch on New Years Day as a result of two things, the first a recommendation from a trusted Chef back in Las Vegas and the second a simple matter of convenience as none of the local mom n' pop shops were open for the holiday.  Small and kitsch, the decor and color scheme harkening a 1970s kitchen while servers bounced around in New Years Eve party hats, it was moments after 7am that I arrived at the sizable Town & Country eatery, no line at such an early hour and seating offered immediately.  Espousing \"Green\" ethics while filling the menu with words like \"Local,\" \"Seasonal,\" and \"Community,\" Snooze offers a menu of \"Fresh Twists on American Classics\" and proudly telling as story of Fair Trade Coffee practices yielding an exclusive roast from Guatemala there is really no questioning the restaurant's ethics, though with such things comes a price higher than the typical restaurant chain while service is so laid back that it almost seems - at times - disinterested.  Eventually flagging down a young lady busy flirting with a fella sporting a man-bun to take my order, two plates and coffee that essentially required begging to be refilled totaling just under $25 before tip, it was no more than fifteen minutes before the kitchen sent plates forth, the portions somewhat smaller than would be anticipated considering the prices and the results 'fine,' though certainly nothing to write home about.  No doubt a bit more interesting than IHOP or Denny's, and additionally offering 'flights' of Bennies and Pancakes that allow diners to dabble without overinvesting on one plate, it was with three style flapjacks that the tasting got underway and with syrups only blending somewhat the \"Pineapple Upside Down\" was still somewhat oddly flavored, the texture actually surprisingly dry while blueberry and Pumpkin were better textured with unique syrups bolstering the taste.  Faring better than the Pancakes and doing an admirable job in sourcing brioche from local artisan Bread & Cie it was next in the Sister Fig's French Toast that taste buds were entrusted, the bread itself as good as remembered though a bit more time soaking would have been a personal preference, while  melted cheese and fig preserves walked a tightrope between sweet and salty, the bright syrup dancing equally well to caramelized nut streusel.",

Oh I was so ready to give it a try!  After everyone was seated we all glanced the menu and after looking at all the great things, I was unsure of what to get, everything sounded soo good.  When it came time to order I went with the Chilaquiles Benedict.  I love eggs benedict and when you can get them styled differently that makes me happy. The Chilaquiles Benedict is barbacoa beef over ranchero sauced tortillas & melted cheese topped with poached eggs & a cream cheesy hollandaise sauce pico de gallo & cotija cheese with a side of hash potatoes.  This dish was visually stunning, and it tasted just as great, very flavourful dish, loved every bite.   Though I didn't get what I originally was wanting, I was not disappointed at all. I loved my dish and look forward to going back to try some more.",

    "text": "We arrived at Snooze for what would be our final meal here AZ before heading back home. My sister claims this is her favorite breakfast spot in Phoenix--which is a huge recommendation considering every breakfast here has been terrific. As I perused the menu I noticed they had a nice selection of fancy pancakes and they all sounded terrific. My Brother-in-law pointed out that they had a thing called the \"Pancake Flight\" where you can choose any three flavors you want.  Pancake Flight:  Pineapple Upside Down Pancake- I had to get this since it was one of the Yelp Review Highlights, and it was pretty good but didn't live up to the hype. I actually would've appreciated more Pineapple in it. While it was good, I doubt I'd order it again. 3*  Molten Chocolate Lava Pancake- This was a little slice of Heaven; it's a chocolate buttermilk pancake with a huge dollop of chocolate custard in the middle and topped with a Tangerine Glaze. Oh, yeah.. it's as good as it sounds. 4.5*  Pancake of the Day- Snooze features a different Pancake everyday, so be sure to ask your server before making any final decisions. On the day I was there it was some kind of Salted Caramel/Cinnamon concoction with a dollop of Ancho-Chocolate Custard in the middle. My jaw dropped as our waitress described it--much as yours did as you read my description. It was superb, and if you're lucky enough to be there when they feature it you *must* get it. 5*  Chocolate-Peanut Butter- My wife ordered this as a side to her eggs, and it was so massive I had to help her finish it--one of the perks when you're married to a light eater! It was pretty good, and tasted a lot like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. I'm not a huge Reese's fan, but if you are then this should be right up your alley! 3.5*  Coffee- Above-standard Diner Coffee, but nothing special. They have a whole placard on your table ballyhooing their coffee, but I just didn't get it. 3.5*  Service & Ambiance- Our server was excellent, and I wish I could remember her name and give her credit, but I misplaced the receipt as well. She was a tall, pretty brunette--you can't miss her. Snooze is a very clean and modern-looking, but I found some of their decorations to be a bit cloying--especially that huge asterisk logo thingy. The place also gets very loud, which I don't particularly want first thing in the morning. Time to invest in some sound dampeners, me thinks. 4.5*-service/2.5*-Ambiance  Value- Standard AZ value of less than $10 for breakfast, but still cheaper than Cali pricing. 4*  Everyone really enjoyed their breakfast here at Snooze; I was tempted to give it a 5th star, but the noise factor was a bit of a turn-off. I'd still probably say it's a solid 4.5-star breakfast joint, and I'd definitely go again and again if I lived in the area; I'll just try to remember to bring some earplugs next time.",

    "text": "Snooze is certainly helping with Town & Country's revival. It took me a while to come here due to the atrocious wait, so after the hype died down I finally tried it. The wait, which is pretty much the only negative, isn't too bad because they take your phone number and will text you when they're ready. It's nice that they have this option, because your not chained inside waiting for your name to be called. They have complimentary coffee while you wait, or you can always go over to Nordstrom Rack next door where I can easily kill 45min - an hour. So while the wait can be long, it's in the most painless way possible.  As for the food, I usually go the healthy route. The Snooze Continental which contains grapefruit brulee is amazing, I'm slightly obsessed with grapefruit brulee and will always order this if I see it on the menu. The pairing of vanilla yogurt with fruit and granola is equally as good. I've also had the Lower East Side which is good if you want to go the savory healthier route. As for the not so healthy, I decided to cheat one day and ordered the Blueberry Danish Pancake with Bacon & Barbacoa breakfast tacos. Oh man, I'm sorry I made this bad calorific decision because it will be so hard not to order either one of those again! The pancake was to die for! It was a fluffy pancake with a lemon ricotta filling, blueberry sauce and to top it off it was sprinkled with Danish crumbles!    If you have a leisurely day and aren't concerned with time constraints, then I highly recommend trying out Snooze.",

All I had was scrambled eggs and potatoes and it felt as if I was eating a plate of grease. I felt sick the rest of the day because all the grease was so unsettling. Over rated and over priced. .75 cents for a slice of toast? No thanks. I'll be spending time and money elsewhere. On a positive note the servers were kind although he admitted to forgetting about my table.",

The food is great and I have been pleased with all of the meals and drinks I have sampled off their menu, but the current trendiness and long wait times make me more likely to choose a different breakfast place in this area.   It's not really justifiable to eat here unless you really have a lot of time on your hands. Today we waited 35 minutes to be sat and another 40 waiting for food. Staff was friendly and pleasant and the patio table we sat at was very nice, but, again, it's just a crazy amount of time to devout to breakfast.  If they could find a way to seat and feed people in a more reasonable amount of time, Snooze would be worth WAY more stars.",

    "text": "Seriously?????? People don't have a clue about food. You put up a cute interior that looks like the \"Jetson's\" cartoon and they will come regardless of food and service. Wife and I arrived on a Thursday around 9:30 and they put us on a wait list and said it would be 15 minutes. They call u by texting your cell. Problem was that after 40 minutes I went in to see what was going on and the host said he texted me 10 minutes ago. Well he wrote down the wrong cell # and said \"oops, will put u back on the list\". I told him \"so for your mistake u want me to wait again?\" He realized that wasn't right so he sat us. After we sat, the waitress greeted us 5 minutes later and we ordered coffee. Which btw, the little cue card on the table says the owner searches all over Costa Rica for the right coffee beans. Hmmm, then he must have went to Folgers plant located there cause it ain't nothin special. Again, 10 minutes pass and we get to order. I had a scramble and the wife had the corned beef hash. Trying to flag down our waitress for a coffee refill was difficult as she was more concerned on how she looked in her LuLu lemon yoga pants rather than on the customers.  Food arrives.  My scramble was slopped together overcooked dry and the potatoes are put in a mold to look fancy, not!  Wife's corned beef....in edible, tasted like it was sitting out for hours & extremely sour. Waitress never bothered to ask how the meal was or thank you, just put check on table. $30 for 2 pathetic excuses for food and 1 \"mystery\" coffee. We got duped!!!!!  Be wise and take a stand, no more eating at places just cause it looks \"cool\".  Yeah.. I guess u could say I was pissed writing this review. In closing Snooze, is the correct name for it..snooze.",

Gave me the daily pancake for my birthday which was super sweet of them, the pancake was amazing, very dense and chocolaty, a few bites in and I was satisfied. They have mix and match options for their eggs Benedict, but I wasn't super impressed by them. The flavors seem fun, but they definitely lack in flavor. The hashbrowns are the worst I've ever had at a restaurant, and I love hashbrowns so that was a big turn off for me. I wouldn't choose to eat here again, but some of my friends are obsessed with this place so I may return with them if they are persistent about it.",

    "text": "Today was my first time visiting with a friend for breakfast. I have to say the eggs Benedict are the bomb!!! They are a must get. As in previous reviews you can mix match and customize your breakfast. Being our first time there we decided to sample a couple of items and share. We started with the eggs Benedict one original and the green chile. The green chile was on a bed of pulled pork that had an amazing flavor. They are a must try. My friend who had the original said it was the best egg Benedict she ever had. Next we did the flight of pancakes. Upside down pineapple, candied Apple, and plain. I tried the pineapple and was not too impressed, but I am not a pineapple person. The candied Apple was phenomenal for me. My friend preferred the pineapple one over Apple. So it's a matter of preference. As for plain I can't give an opinion because I didn't try it. But I assume from all the other food it would have been good.  Now on service I wish I knew the servers name because she was amazing. We asked her what she would recommend since it was our first time. She took the time to explain the menu and showed us how we could customize.  She was friendly warm and conversational. She was on top of the service. At the end of the meal she even asked us if we would come back to see her tomorrow. Which made us feel welcomed. Although I wish I could eat there daily it is out of my area, but I will definitely visit regularly.  To the anonymous server thank you for an awesome experience.  To management you have a great server. Hopefully she will be there the next time we visit. I wish I would have left a manager compliment.",

It was outrageously great and uniformly impressive. As a table full of food bloggers, we ordered as many things as we decently could from the menu: spud stack deluxe, breakfast tacos, Bella! Bella! Benny, chilaquiles benny, a variety of pancakes, a hot chocolate, a hot chai, and other goodies. All were perfectly executed, impressive, and seriously lip-smacking. The price for our meal -huge and impressive as it was- was reasonable.  I highly recommend Snooze!",

This time we came at 730am on a Sunday which was the perfect time since dining room was half full and patio is empty.  The menu is eclectic and different from any other breakfast place.  They have a list of hollandaise concoctions, breakfast tacos that are to die for, many different pancake options and the typical breakfast fare such as omelettes, eggs etc.  the service was fast and super friendly.  We had 3 different servers talk to us and make sure we were taken care of.  We will definitely be coming back and if there is a wait, it is indeed worth waiting.  Until next time.",

Also, people were constantly asking us to pick up wayward ping-pong balls that had rolled underneath our table. Next time, I will make sure we ask for a table somewhere far away. But, that said, can't wait to go back. :-)",

We get called and the hostess tried to sit us at a table for two. We are left standing there waiting while she figures it out.   We get a table make our drink orders. My husband orders a soda and he's brought a coffee. Not a big deal but a big sign of what's ahead. Soda refills came easily but had to pretty much beg for a coffee refill.  Next up we order breakfast and it arrives and my 6 year old son's order was wrong. Something that should be fixed very quickly instead took about 20 minutes for his correct order to come out. But to make it better our waiter comes over 3 times to say it's not his fault and the manager tells us it's delayed because she had people not want to come to work because of the PF Chang marathon. None of this is my problem.  The rest of us had correct orders but none of it was hot. Not a single thing that hit out table was warm.   We won't be back.",

Came in and immediately sat at the bar, our server was over promptly to get our drink orders. The place was overly crowded and half the people in there were standing either right behind where you were sitting and eating basically breathing down your neck and there was no room to move. Once our waitress came back with our drinks she took our order and left. About 15 or so minutes go by and we got our food. Now we had no expectations specially since we were getting breakfast on a Sunday morning but, having all your customers wait to be seated right by people eating is beyond annoying. Now if we would've waited for a booth or a table the wait was right around 30-50 minutes and it would've been fine to wait except we were hungry and the bar had openings eating so we jumped on that. Maybe try having people sit outside after they checked in so that your entrance area isn't so jammed pack? Which is also a fire hazard having so many people stand in front of the only exit way...",

Although the pot pie was cream-based, the pairing with a light flaky pastry makes the whole portion light and airy. The flavoring is just right - not too salty.  The OMG French Toast was a much smaller portion than expected but it was amazing! The level of sweetness for the sauce is similar to those of condense milk.   Overall, I enjoyed the both breakfast picks, maybe more so for the French Toast since I have a thing for sweet breakfast.",

On this trip, we had the Chile Verde Benny (pork green chile Benedict) and the BEAT (bacon, egg, arugula, tomato) breakfast sandwich.  Each dish came with a side of hashbrowns.  For the benedict,all I can say is WOW!!!!!  The pork and chile hollandaise were out of this world good. I was sopping up every inch of sauce from that plate.  I am 100% ordering it again, and I think my bf was a little jealous of my order.  Not that his sandwich wasn't fantastic (it was incredibly tasty), but that benedict dish is an absolute star.  And fun side note: if you enjoy coffee, and specifically their coffee, you can buy a bag of beans to take home :)  I didn't buy a bag on this trip, but am definitely considering it the next time I go.  If you go on a weekend, expect a bit of a wait, but trust me...it's worth it!",

Not totally the canned salty stuff. It was cooked to perfection.  Service: totally awesome. Not one discrepancy from any of the folks working there. Truly a happy crew that pulls as a team. Loved the place. Will definitely return again and again.",

    "text": "Well I finally had a chance to try out Snooze Eatery and really enjoyed the grub.  I say that even though we had to wait an hour for a seat. The family stopped by on Sunday morning and as mentioned, the place was very busy. No big deal, the wife and daughter drained the pocket book at other retail shops while we waited :). The restaurant had a nice vibe to it. Our waiter was very outgoing and helpful. For the food, we tried the trio of pancakes (pineapple, peach, and potato) and a benedict plate (sadly forgot the name). All were super tasty and if sweet is your thing, the pancakes are the way to go. Again though, both dishes were oh so good. I will definitely come by again and just hope its sooner than later.",

    "text": "So I came on a Sunday about an hour before they closed.   My real complaint that almost made me walk out without even trying the food was the hostess. I walked in and there were 3 guys at the hostess stand talking to the hostess. No sign that said wait to be seeted so I did not know if you sat yourself or waited on her. I stood for 3 minutes while she flirted with the 3 guys and never acknowledge me. I finally asked excuse me may I just sit anywhere and she said oh yeah the breakfast bar is open have a seat.   I went and sat down and waited another 4 minutes before a server showed up. This did not bother me because they were busy but could have been helped by a halfway decent hostess. The server then had to backtrack to the hostess stand to get me a menu and silverware. She also had to do this for a couple that came in after me and the hostess pointed towards the breakfast bar while continuing her talk with the 3 guys.   Food: Fantastic 4.5 out of 5 I had a half order of eggs Benedict with 1 blueberry streusal pancake. Their made from scratch blueberry topping was amazing. Also their coffee cups are thick enough they retain heat.   Service 3.5 out of 5. My server did a good job and was nice but seemed overwhelmed or over sat.   I wouls love to give them 4 stars but unless they can change their staffing I am not sure I will even go back.",

But soon figured it out after my first bite. Wow! It is a fun place to go when you have the time.  Both the savory and sweet dishes are amazing.  I preferred mine, the eggs Benedict to the pancakes but those were also crazy good. I recommend ordering a side of bacon as it was delicious.   Negatives: Don't go here if you're in a rush. You will certainly have to wait your turn",

    "text": "Extremely disappointed in their lack of customer service and dishonesty here. Im from Los Angeles and was visiting some friends this weekend in Phoenix. We had a 3pm flight to catch so we got to the restaurant at 1030am. We assumed from the number of yelp reviews that it was popular and would have a wait so we were pleasantly surprised when they told us 15-20 mins. 30 mins later when we asked about our table they said there were 3 tables in front of us and it should be another 15-20 mins. I specifically asked asked are you sure, you don't think it's going to be longer? And they said no, about 15-20 mins. Another 45 mins later we were told there were 6 tables in front of us and it should be 15-30 mins. At that point we didn't want to risk it and just found another spot to eat. An hour and a half from when we put our name down we got a text that our table would be ready soon. An hour and a half!  I completely understand long waits, especially for good food and trendy restaurants. What I don't understand is giving False wait times to your guest. If we were told an hour to an hour and a half wait at the beginning we would have realized we couldnt wait that long and just left, no harm. But to give your guests unrealistic wait times is not good customer service. In addition, I don't understand how it jumped from 3 tables to 6 tables ahead of us. It was suppose to be on a first come first serve basis so I hope we weren't discriminated against for having 2 children with us.  I was very excited to try this place but will never come back here and our friends who live in Phoenix will spread that word too.",

(Although they take your number and since it's in an outdoor shopping center you can pass time by shopping).   I'm on a no caffeine and low salt diet. Unfortunately they do not have an online nutrition menu - really wish they did! However the waitress told me they could cook my hash browns without any salt which was great! Loved how crunchy it was! A little on the greasy side, but it didn't taste like it was drenched in it. I ordered a decaf iced vanilla latte, she said they only had decaf in hot but offered to put that over ice for me and it worked great! I would definitely come back again!",

Unfortunately this will be my last time visiting this establishment as it is out of control with the dogs and animals that are allowed in. I was absolutely shocked when I saw one of the restaurant patrons had their dog sitting up on the (humans)chair and licking the table to pick up scraps of food that had fallen off of one of the plates. I even took pictures I think I'm going to forward to the Phoenix Arizona department of public health and appropriate governing bodies because this is unacceptable. Hate to do that but I think there is no excuse for this kind of behavior. Can we really not leave the animals home while we go out to breakfast with the family? can dogs not go out for a walk at a later time such that we are at a point that they really need to be eating breakfast with us at the restaurant? It's a bit silly and management should be ashamed",

    "text": "This Snooze AM Eatery was especially nice for me as I lived not too far away at Aura Apts (1920 E Indian School Road), so it was nice to take a quick drive and have garage parking readily available at the shopping center that Snooze is at.  The customer obsession with Snooze is real. I've never been to Snooze and not ran into a fully filled room of seated tables.  When I last came here, I ordered the corned beef hash, which is \"Snooze's signature shredded hash mixed with artisan corned beef, caramelized poblanos and onions. Topped with two eggs your style & toast or tortillas\" as advertised on their website. It was delicious! Savory eggs with just-the-right-salty corned beef with those somewhat sweet poblano peppers. Mm mm mm!  I also ordered a Mountain Mule, which at the time of this review is described as \"CapRock Organic Gin, Fever Tree Ginger Beer, Grapefruit juice, Fresh Lime & Agave Nectar\" according to their website.  Since I've moved to Rancho Cucamonga in California, I won't be as likely to come to this Snooze anymore, which makes me a little sad. Furthermore, the nearest Snooze to me is all the way in Costa Mesa, over 50 miles away in LA traffic! Womp womp womp.  BTW they have Wi-Fi here and it is fast even when the house is full.",

Came out shortly later. Two large English muffins with tomato, avocado, Parmesan crisp, with a poached egg and hollandaise sauce.  Damn good egg Benedict.  Good portion and tasted fresh.    Only knock is it needed quite a bit of salt.  I'm not sure if it comes this way on purpose or the chef didn't taste.  Also came with a small stack of hash browns. Which were also lacking salt and on the cold side.   The menu looked pretty good. As well as the drinks.   Water was filtered and free WiFi would make this place a frequent spot if you worked in the area.   Kudos for having Sir Kinsington ketchup and cholula sauce.",

Service was good even for how busy it was, and the food took only 12-15 mins to arrive.  We got the breakfast burrito which was good but felt like needed more acidity.. either from the salsa or pico.  The cornbeef hash was awesome. Chocolate chip pancakes are to die for. The BEAT sandwich which is basically a BLT with eggs. Was so good! And the pancake of the day which was a blueberry mascarpone was so heavenly.  In summary this place is the spot to be for breakfast. They have many different options and twists on classic breakfast plates. You won't be disappointed!",

I had the coupon for a free cinnamon roll pancake from when they were at Best of the Biltmore (or was that the Best of New Times??)  Oh, well, one of those best events.   My daughter had the B.E.A.T. sandwich.  Rachel was our server.  We sat outside cause why not with today's weather.   I had ordered a couple of egga to offset the pancake.   The pancake was light and fluffy and the sauce on top was oh so sweet.   Almost too sweet.   The eggs helped cut down on how sweet I thought it was although I did save the rest for later that day, and it didn't seem so bad.   Still light and fluffy, though.     My daughter's sandwich was an acronym for bacon, egg, avocado and tomato.   I ate half of that later as well as the side of hash browns.  She skipped the avocado.     Lots of thick cut bacon, which I love.  Even though I ate it as a leftover, the bread was not soggy, and the condiments were quite tasty.   Of course, the bacon is what really added to it since it was essentially a bacon sandwich by that time.  I still vote the blueberry danish pancake as the best so far at this place.   Whenever I think of eating at Snooze, that's what I want to order.",

    "text": "This place has potential but the three times I've been here it's been seriously lacking. They don't take reservations so you usually have to wait 40 minutes to an hour or more for a table. Okay, that's fine. The service is what really sucks. They're inattentive for starters and they're always in a hurry and will literally walk away as your talking and inevitably get your order wrong. Today we went for breakfast and I ordered an iced chai.. when they brought it I took a sip and noticed there was lipstick on the rim right where I drank from. Disgusting. We waited for the waiter to finally return from flirting with the girl at the next table. My plan was to tell him about the lipstick and ask for a water instead (the chai was too sweet for me anyway) with a straw. As I start to tell him he's too busy literally walking away from me and making a joke while talking over me about how it's his shade of lipstick that he didn't hear my order. So the bar runner brought a new chai and dropped it off so fast I didn't even have the chance to say anything. Our food arrived by a runner, our server was still flirting, and it was cold. They didn't give us silverware and we waited for 15 more minutes before I decided to just get up and find some. I literally walked up to the server station.   The last time we were here the server spilled a tray of three mimosas all over my fiance's lap and brand new white sneakers. Their apology was a free pancake that none of us wanted. His sneakers are ruined and you know those aren't cheap.   It's a shame cause the food can be good when it's warm but the people who work there really don't give a damn.",

Once we ordered my mother in law ordered a mimosa and about 15 min goes by our food arrives and still no drink. Half way done with our meal our waitress finally checks in and I told her to remove the mimosa because we were basically done with our meal. I'm a waitress myself and the experience we had was awful, I understand there are other things waitresses do while on shift but it wasn't busy or anything. So I'm not really sure what happened.",

You could literally get half/half of so many things because that's how they run. We got one gf blueberry pancake (AHHMAZING). I did a byo bene. I wanted avocado but not the green chili so I just did my own avocado with bacon. It was so great, and the flavor/spices of hash browns just falling apart in my mouth kept making me eat more, more and more. It was so much food I couldn't eat it all and the rest of the bene and hash browns tasted just as great heated up later. My boyfriend got the pick two bene (see you don't have to settle on one) and he devoured his as he always does. Our service was on point. We asked for the oj as the food came and she never missed a beat. Coffee was also filled, plates were always cleared- just a productive environment.   They did have a sign on one of their doors and it says \"the most expensive thing in a restaurant is an empty table\" and I don't think they will ever have a problem with that as how well they all worked together.",

I had a Bangkok Bloody while we waited for our table - it had Sriracha, lime, cilantro, basil, fish sauce, and fixings - very unique & satisfying! When I got to the table, I also ordered an iced dirty drunken chai with espresso, coffee liquor, and cruzan rum - again, very delicious. Our server was hilarious and great - even sitting down and chatting with us for awhile. The perhaps best thing about this place is that you can order a Benny Duo - can't deiced which benedict you want to order? No problem, you can get 1 of each!!! Every girl's dream. They have lots of options (classic, lox style salmon & cream cheese over toasted rye, prosciutto & arugula over ciabatta, and more) but I ended up going with the Chili Verde with pulled pork and Steak + Eggs atop roasted poblano cheddar grit cakes with asparagus, roasted mushrooms, and tomato. They were both probably the best benedicts I've ever had. A+",

    "text": "It bums me out to write this review since Snooze has historically been one of my favorite restaurants, however this most recent visit was inexcusably bad. I want to preface with the fact that the food is always delicious, and all of my problems have been with incompetent service.   Upon arriving we were told the wait time would be 30 minutes, and upon waiting we were called in 5. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing, however I was ready to leave instead of waiting half an hour for a table. My girlfriend talked us into staying. As far as the estimates is concerned the hosts need to give more accurate information or they run the risk of losing potential customers.  When we were seated our server greeted us about 3 minutes in and took our full orders. We asked for 2 waters to start and a couple simple drinks I've ordered at least 4 or 5 times before without issue. This is where the problems arise.  A family of 4 came in about 5 minutes after we did, at which point their drink orders were taken. We proceeded to wait 10 minutes with no drinks while the family received theirs in about a minute or 2. When our two drinks came out, we still had not been served any waters, and the drinks were 100% in accurate. I was served a half cup of foam with nothing else in the cup, when I'd ordered a tea latte with honey. My girlfriend's drink came out without the whipped cream she'd ordered.  We flagged down another server and asked if they could get our server, who had been MIA since taking our order nearly 20 minutes prior. She came to the table and I explained the situation to her. She proceeded to give me an excuse for every issue, to which we were of course sympathetic. She corrected the issues to the best of her ability, and for that I commend her. However, the incident had already left a poor taste in my mouth.  The food was delicious as always, and we of course had not been offered any condiments, so I stood up and found some for us to use, considering I didn't expect to see any of the wait staff any time soon.  The real issue came from the bill. My girlfriend got an entree that consisted of 2 free add-ins and the ability to pay for additional ones. She chose what most people would add, a meat and a sauce, and then asked to have an extra side of spinach and tomatoes, each of which were listed for 75 cents. The meat and sauce were listed as aproximately 3 dollars each. So when we got our bill, we saw that the tomatoes and spinach had been the items added in for free to the meal, and they had charged us for the meat and sauce that she originally ordered to come with the dish.  I don't know if this is common practice for Snooze, but I don't think I'll be returning. For as good as the food is, having to go through the headache of just getting what you wanted to order in the first place is not worth it to me.",

She never brought my daughters apple juice.  My glass had lipstick on it but fortunately, I had my own water bottle to drink water. Our food took a very long time as well and when it finally came out, my order was wrong. It was supposed to be a gluten free pancake but it was not. That could have been really bad. It took a REALLY long time to get the replacement pancake and when it finally arrived, I had about 5 minutes to eat as we needed to get to an appointment soon. I ate some of my gluten free pancake and it was really awful. I've eaten GF pancakes there before and they were really good. This pancake was gritty and just had a really weird taste. Needless to say, I ate about 3 bites. I let the server know it tastes funny and she informed me they changed the GF pancake flour. That is too bad because the prior gluten free pancakes were pretty darn good as GF goes. The new ones are gritty, leave a film in your mouth and have a very funky taste. I'm sad because this was my go to place for GF pancakes. I won't be back now that there is so few items I can eat there with pancakes no longer an option.  I think the server was going to try to get a manager over to see about making it right but it was taking awhile and  since everything took so long, we didn't have time to wait and had to leave.",

When I transferred to ASU my sophomore year, you can imagine how much I missed my favorite breakfast place. So when I heard that they were opening one out here in AZ, I was ecstatic. The menu was almost the same but more expansive and a little more \"southwest\" than the rocky mountain counterpart that I was used to.    I had my all-time favorite, the Bella! Bella! Benny without meat. It was divine. They top it with  a perfect balsamic reduction and creamy cheesy hollandaise sauce. It's on a bed of arugula and small crostini. It's a dream. They recently started allowing 1/2 and 1/2 where you can choose two benedicts for your plate instead of two of the same. I think this is such a cool concept, but I always stick with my go-to.   My boyfriend gets The B.E.A.T Sandwich. The man gives that Guy Fieri look to me every time. You know, the one when something is really, really....REALLY good. Guy, if you're reading this, you HAVE to come visit this place.   Expect a wait for a table on a Saturday or Sunday morning, but it's definitely worth it! They text you on your phone so you are free to roam around the shopping center while you wait. If you're anything like me and you end up here after a night out on the town, there's a Nordstrom Rack right next door to get a change of outfit.",

    "text": "By far my favorite breakfast spot! The food is always spot on and I never get tired of ordering the same thing or mixing it up. I usually order the flight of pancakes with a chocolate chip, blueberry danish, and pineapple upside down pancake or the Chilaquiles Benedict. To be honest I have had all of the Benedicts  and they never disappoint.   The customer service is top notch, my family has always been well taken care of and we have even been gifted free pancakes. (The best is the pineapple upside down pancake)   There is usually a wait but they take your number and then text you when your table is ready. While you wait you can go browse at Nordstrom Rack next door, Paper Source or one of the many surrounding stores. Trust me the wait it worth it!",

Can't decide, get the \"Flight\" and you can try three different pankcakes, or OMG French toast or fig French toast as one of the pancakes.  Eggs Benedict? You have to try the Bella, bella or Chilquilas. Corned beef, Lox... Can't decide, get two different ones on the same plate with a hash brown cake on the side.  Havana daydreaming sammie!!!!

Staff is friendly even when it's very busy. They take your order right away so you don't wait around. Food is extraordinary. Undecided between two? No problem. They have the option of half order of one and half order of the other. And I was really pleased to taste the Bella Bella Benny and the Benny Goodman. The Italian version of the eggs Benedict comes on ciabatta bread and balsamic drizzle. Delicious! The acidity of the balsamic makes an excellent contrast with the sweetness of the hollandaise sauce. The goodman salmon one was also good, but I wouldn't order it again. They also have items a la carte if you don't want the preselected side. I would be back, maybe on earlier hours to skip the line! ;-)",

The atmosphere was up beat, trendy, and loud. Not too loud. Just perfect so that you could have a normal conversation without being overheard.

I felt the service was a little slow, but our server was kind, so it wasn't too big of a deal.  I ordered the breakfast pot pie, having eyed it before. I ended up not liking it at all. There was too much gravy, and the pastry was kind of gross. I couldn't eat even a 1/3 of it. My husband ordered the corned beef hash, and it was delicious, but the portion was TINY. He was still quite hungry after finishing. We both tried our toddler's blueberry pancakes and they were so good. It made me wish we had just stuck with the pancake flight instead of delving into the savory dishes.",

    "text": "I like this place.  It's somewhere between a A-OK, and Yay I'm a fan.  I'd likely go back if in the area again.  Food was decent. and drinks were good and all was reasonably priced.    Nothing particularly stuck out, good or bad.  Our waitress was friendly, but not particularly engaging - fine.  All food was good and as described on menu.  i thought both of our benedicts could have been a little saucier, and my 'green chili holandaise' tasted neither like hollandaise nor green chili's.  It was both bland and scant.  However, the rest of the dish was fine, and tasty without the sauce - which was good, since the sauce, as mentioned, was both bland and scant.   We liked our drinks (Mmm Mmm Mimosas) and they were both reasonably priced and sized.   We were given a 30-45 minute wait for a table upon arrival and were seated in that time.  There's a service bar area where you can get a cocktail while you wait.  I'm assuming they serve coffee as well - but we don't do that, so i'm not sure.    They had the only decent/interesting looking breakfast menu in the central/down-town phoenix area - which is why we went.  While there was nothing wrong with the place, I suspect as more and more places of interest come to the area (as has been happening the last 10 years, and the last 5 especially), that they will have to step up  their game a bit to keep the crowds coming.  Anyway - we look forward to returning to phoenix again next winter to see what they and the area are offering. :)",

Great layout, design etc.  However, The wait on weekends is very long.  The staff, organization and management are very poor. I have gone several times on weekends and watch empty tables for up to five minutes and the table has yet to be cleared. Once cleared and re-set, the table sits empty for several more minutes before they get around to sitting customers.  And I'm not talking about one table but four or five tables just sitting there while customers are outside in the heat waiting.  So frustrating!   You can tell the staff and management are not well trained!",

I ordered the three egg plate with my eggs over-medium because I hate runny whites. Guess what? Eggs came barely over easy. This plate was suppose to come with toast! Didn't get any to wipe up my runny egg whites. To top off the experience, a different server grabbed our salt and pepper shakers to do his side work and touched my straw with his hand as he put them back. Not sure why it's become acceptable for servers to be pulling items off our table when I'm trying to enjoy my meal but I find it rude. Might try the one in Tempe but more than likely sticking with Matt's Big Breakfast!",

I went for the sweet potato pancake, which is usually a semi sweet puffy heavenly plate of happiness. This time, they messed up and put the caramel on and had to take it back... About 10 minutes after everyone has cleaned their plates I got mine. I would've canceled it if we had been checked on more. The worst pancake arrived... A flat, sad regular pancake with chunks of sweet  potato. This was NOTHING like it has been in the past, I had two bites. The soyrizo was also horrible.. A mushy patty? The server knew that the food was bad as well as the service and apologized, but didn't offer to comp any of our uneaten food. Womp. The iced coffee is also not good, tastes like 5% coffee the rest water. It's weird because they even have a brochure about their special coffee. Anyways, I might be back because it used to be so good but definitely with low expectations. Snooze, what happened!?",

Havana daydreaming - whole plate came out cold, hash browns potatoes were under cooked. hollandaise tasted like plastic.  eggs benny duo - verde and the rancheros were both delicious. hash browns again under cooked. they were actually crunchy  michelada - Delicious  gazpacho drink - fantastic  server I forgot his name he was awesome. since it was our first time there he gave us a sweet potato pancake. it was very tasty, too much syrup was definitely an over kill. but it tasted like a creme brule which is fantastic.",

We made a decision to just give our gift card the manager gave us to someone else. We rather go somewhere the employees at least have an appearance that they somewhat enjoy their job and the people they are servicing. I would suggest looking into retraining your staff. Smiles, attentiveness, and being nice are part of a servers job. If you have 1 bad seed, it can spread. I believe this is the case here.

    "text": "Breakfast the most important meal of the day...but also your start of the day. With all that is hectic in life with work and everything going on in this town one would want a good breakfast experience.   Upon arrival for a late breakfast I walked in just before 2 groups who were being sat by the hostess. The hostess being busy did not greet me and the mod came and greeted me and got me sat. I chose to sit at the breakfast bar which had to be cleaned. The manager told me someone would be with me soon... nearly 15 minutes later a server finally came over to take my drink order. By then I already knew what i wanted to eat and drink. I ordered both at the same time since who knows how long it would be if I order the two separate. At this time if the waitress had not come by I was mere seconds from walking out. Being that I also work in the same type of industry I understand and would wait but this was pretty long wait.   After ordering, a few minutes later the server arrived with my coffee and water. I had ordered the breakfast pot pie with scrambled eggs. This is the same thing I order every time I come to Snooze, here and in San Diego. I waited close to 30 min for my order... during this time no visit from the server or anyone to say anything about the order taking so long. Again mere seconds from walking and some guy brings my order. At this point my short quick breakfast was nearing 45 minutes and I was survived by the sugar and caffeine from my coffee. I was so hungry that as I dove face first violently into the hash brown hockey puck I noticed that my egg was not scrambled but was over medium. Not just that it was a mistake over medium but a perfectly cooked to order over medium egg, now that is great if you like it that way but I'm very particular to how I like my eggs and I like them scrambled. Had we been at the point where I didn't wait forever for my food that I would have asked for them made over, but I have the rest of my day to get started. In a hungry starvation induced fit of rage I finished most of the hash brown to notice that there was a great portion of it being al dente. Which would have been great if it was pasta but potatoes...   Life was great, I met some awesome people this year and made some great memories... then I walked into snooze. I know we all have that one bad day, the day where everything goes wrong. This was that day for snooze, we crashed today... and you almost took me down with you. Well let's just say that I will be giving this location a break for a long time. I recommended so many people to this place and now I'm regretting it as I hope that they didn't get the same experience as I have. Well next time I go for breakfast maybe i'll go to Denny's instead.",

They should flatten them out so they are crispy. If I'm going to spend calories on hash browns they need to be good.  Also I'm not sure if you had only an hour for lunch if you could eat there.

    "text": "So my mom and my sister and I are visiting my other sister who now lives here, and our sister loves this spot so she brought us here directly after she picked us from the airport. She's been raving about how this is her favorite breakfast place and said we have to eat here. I have to say, this place definitely didn't disappoint and now i know why she eats here constantly. We had Aily as our server... OMGGGG she is the sweetest!!!!! She catered to us from beginning to end and even brought us a complimentary pineapple upside down pancake because she heard us debating back and forth about whether we should order it, because all the food options looked so good that we couldn't decide. Definitely delicious! We forgot to take pics of our food because we legit devoured it when It touched our table... THE FOOD WAS SOOOOOOOO DELICIOUS! so we're here for a week, and we already decided we want to have breakfast here a few more times before we leave... with Aily as our waitress! The entire staff was incredibly accommodating and we didn't have reservations but they sat us outside as we asked in 4 minutes. Speedy, friendly, service and amazing food. HIGHLY RECOMMEND EVERYONE READING THIS TO EAT HERE!   With love from Philly",

The benny we had was good but not great, and the pancake flight underwhelmed.  Pineapple upside down pancake was watery and the sweet potato pancake didn't have any sweet potato taste at all.  And my lord the ginger butter was way over the top.  Also, their hash browns look pretty but are a pile of mush.  Boo...  Place seemed trendy and most folks were sipping mimosas and bloody Mary's.  Maybe that's our mistake, this one's for hair of the dog not great eats.",

Friends I was with ordered the Huevos Rancheros (I tried some of the beans) and it too, was so flavorful. Although we were inside and it was quite loud, the food was worth it that day.

We patiently waited the hour that we were quoted, but for one reason or the other our name got removed from the list by mistake according to the hostess. When the manager (Echo) came she basically blamed us and lied in saying that she had called for our party several times. We never got the second text message from the hostess and were also waiting right by the front door, our name was never called. Fact of the matter- I get it, you're busy...but you messed up, not me.  Echo, without even briefly looking in to the situation with the hostess, blamed us by default and didn't bother with an apology. This place lost 2 stars in my book for the less than average customer service offered by the manager Echo. Our server Stephanie was awesome, we were very well taken care of after we were finally seated.",

Oh wait, welcome to Snooze AM Eatery and highly popular breakfast/brunch joint that I first heard about out in the SD area.  When I attended I had to wait for 30 mins with my gang.  No worries I expected to wait since it only opens during the day.  When we finally sat we all decided to share the pancake trio - Pancake of the Day (Blueberry syrup with powdered sugar), Strawberry-Rhubarb, and the BanaNutella.  Of course we all each order an entree.  I went with Snooze Spud Deluxe - a plate of hash browns mixed with bacon and chorizo and topped with an overeasy egg!  Overall, this dish was a crunchy, mix of breakfast meat and egg with it's oozy yolk which helped mellow out the bite -- Yummy!   The pancakes were okay I thought.  I'm not much of a dessert pancake guy; the strawberry one was soggy since it was drenched in the strawberry-rhubarb sauce.  My favorite was the BanaNutella pancake - crunch of the hazelnuts and soft at the same time with a savory nutella!  We ordered the OMG French Toast just to top it off -- OMG was it good!    Overall, great service and the ambiance was vibrant and full of life.  A great way to start off the morning with good old fashion yet modern breakfast! - Enjoy!",

    "text": "I ate at Snooze after arriving in PHX to see my parent's. We went here based on the reviews and proximity to the airport.   It was VERY BUSY on a Wednesday, it took 20 to get a seat. It's a cool looking place, kind of modern and retro.   My only complaint is there's no waiting area, so we just stood by the door. We looked at the menu in advance, and in Reno, I like Brad's Huevo's at Peg's, so I thought I would try it here.   We sat and our server was Fanny. Fanny was very nice and personable and we quickly ordered and got some great coffee.   Before the food came out there was a mysterious blueberry pancake and we were all confused because my parents are low carb, and being a Dragon, I would never get full off a pancake, so I didn't order, turns out Fanny was giving us a Special \"On The House Pancake\"!!! Very Cool!!! =)   It was the BEST PANCAKE I have ever eaten, and I am not a big fan of pancakes. It was made a hot grill so it was a great cook with texture on the outside, and inside was delicious and as you get to the center there's like lemon cream cheese. Anyways if you like pancakes you found Pancake Heaven Here!   My Huevo's arrived and I did Reno \"Brad\" style by getting a sausage patty underneath. All the meats here are thoughtful as they tell you the farm everything comes from and you could 100% taste the specialness. My sausage patty was the highlight!   Why only 4 Stars? Mainly because as I often do, my reviews are comparisons, and if Brad's Huevo's at Peg's is 5 Stars, it's hard to live up to that. My favorite part of this meal was the sauce it 100% grows on you and the sausage patty. If you are in PHX, I would definitely check this place out! AND...If you are smart, ask for Fanny, if you want great and personable service! =)",

I completely understand a longer wait for weekends and holidays.   I've been quoted 2 hours and 15 minutes for Snooze. We mostly eat here on weekdays and it's still 30-45 minutes. The longer wait usually attributes to their \"text\" system which I've never received, only to have my table given away because I wasn't aware it was ready.   Today, around 10am on Friday, we were third in line at the hostess stand. The first couple was quoted 30 minutes. While the next person was getting checked in, we waited several minutes before a hostess even spoke with us as she was conversing about class schedules rather than inputting us into a wait list.   Meanwhile during this conversation a two top approached the hostess stand and was sat immediately.   With so many breakfast restaurants in the area, I'll gladly drive farther to be seated in a timely and orderly manner and negate hostess favoritism.",

The pancake was on the same level. The Scramble was good but took a major back seat to the other items.  Service was solid too.  We had a really good sever.  Philip was his name.  He was very efficient, very nice and gave solid recommendations.  For as busy as they were he did an amazing job holding down all of his tables.   The place has a great vibe to it, busy and bustling but stayed clean and under control.    You get a bang for your buck for sure.  You pay for good food but you aren't giving an arm or a leg.",

A friend recommended this place for brunch after we hiked Squaw Peak Trail and it was the perfect fit after a hot day of hiking. The restaurant itself is very trendy and quite popular so I suggest getting there early to avoid the brunch and lunch rush.   I wanted a meal that was not too heavy yet still filled me up so I chose \"3 Eggs Any Style.\" It comes with 3 eggs that are cooked however you want them, a fistful of seasoned hashbrowns and a wide variety of bread to choose from for toast. Although the meal I had was simple, it was absolutely delicious and the hashbrowns are what sold me on this place as a whole. The hashbrowns are already seasoned to perfection (in my opinion at least) and are crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.   Other than some of the items on the menu being a little overpriced, I give this place 2 thumbs up and I definitely see this place becoming my new breakfast/brunch spot!",

I recommend trying it during the week because I hear it's near impossible to get in there on weekends.  The hostess was friendly. The waiter was fantastic. The food was incredible. I had Juan's Breakfast tacos with chicken sausage. When the food was presented, it looked like a 5-star chef's work - visually very pleasing - and it tasted even better. Our service was great - our waters, teas and coffees never seemed to get less than half full before refills were on the way.  I've lived in Phoenix most of my life, and this is by far the best find for a great breakfast experience.",

The food is innovative and delicious.  I love breakfast, but there is usually one thing on the plate that could be prepared a bit better. Not here.  Our food came out hot and perfect.  I had the breakfast pot pie - puff pastry covered with a mild sausage gravy and a perfect over-easy egg.  Puff pastry crunchy and flaky?  Check.  Sausage gravy smooth and just the right thickness?  Check.  Egg cooked just over and hot?  Check.  Then, to top it all off, a round mold of the most delicious, perfectly crisped hash browns ever!    My husband had the breakfast burrito.  Not original, you say?  Think again.  Fluffy, creamy eggs, with onions, chorizo and hash browns in a soft, soft, soft (not mushy, soft) burrito with a salsa verde on top.  I do not like chorizo or onions, but on this burrito, it was a perfect combination.  I wanted to eat slowly so I would never finish this meal.  The menu is so innovative and everything looks and sounds delicious.  We watched people rave to one another about the sweet potato pancakes and the Bella=Bella Benny.  The wait is more than worth it - but if you hate to wait, come early.  You will be happy you did.",

We finally went this last Sunday and it didn't disappoint.   First let me say if you are looking for a quick in and out breakfast this is not your place. Expect to wait. They quoted us a 90 minute wait time. They get your cell phone number and text you when you table is ready. This works out great if you want to go next door and browse around at Nordstrom Rack. They texted us in just over an hour that our table was ready.   Service was great and the server was very knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered the Snooze spuds deluxe which was so delicious! We also ordered the pancake flight with a pineapple upside down pancake, a sweet potato pancake and a candied apple pancake. All were to die for!   This place is definitely worth the wait and I can't wait until the one in North Scottsdale is open in Kierland!",

Or twenty more of standing inside being pushed and shove by the crowd, after being told three times our table was being cleaned, and six or seven tables being sat before us, I watched as the host cleared a table a few rows in and FINALLY sat us, we then waited ten minutes to be greeted by a server who was visually displeased. As the meal progressed getting the smallest things to the table as water and ketchup seemed to not only be the most excruciatingly painful thing for our server but also took plenty of time.. The food was okay, took a bit longer then expected, but the service left a sour taste in our group of sevens mouth that we just couldn't shake..

I got the Smoked Salmon Benedict...cream cheese Hollandaise, GENUIS!!!!! The Sweet Potato Pancakes with Caramel sauce, I mean c'mon this should be against the law. It is so delicious!!!

    "text": "THE BEST BREAKFAST EVER!! I am so impressed with Snooze. We were seated within 15 mins on busy 4th of July. Everything my family and I ordered was delicious and well put together. We had free refills on fresh squeezed juice and delicious coffee. Our waiter Alex was so kind, attentive, funny and efficient. The music was great, the place was super clean, the plates and silverware were retro and cool. The manager came over to talk to us about our experience and she was so nice!! She told us about how the Snooze franchise composts, recycles and repurposes everything right down to the kids crayons and soda straws. They serve cage free eggs and free range meat and all the ingredients were fresh and flavorful. Not a single complaint about Snooze. The absolute best breakfast in Phoenix, a lovely environment and awesome staff.",

Pancake Flight - In order of yumminess: Chocolate chip cookie dough special, Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes, and plain blueberry pancakes. Light, fluffy, sweet but not overly. 2. Breakfast Pot Pie - I did add mushroom and a layer of spinach on top.  Very good.  Not overly indulgent. 3. Snooze Spuds Deluxe - Least favorite.  Just a lot of potatoes and toppings.  Needed a sauce.",

I ordered the breakfast pot pie.  Flaky, light crust with an interesting combination of sausage and gravy and veggies that have you licking your plate, topped with a Sunnyside up egg.  Nice!  My friends ordered the breakfast tacos and the pancake flight.  More things to try the next time.  And the next time.  And the next time.",
