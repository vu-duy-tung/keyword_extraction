I've been here twice for dinner and was not impressed. The first time I tried the mahi sandwich with a side salad. The flavor was good, nice ingredients like avocado and bacon, but the fish was overcooked. I tried to power through because I enjoyed the flavor, but just couldn't get past the rubbery, chewy fish. I ended up just pulling the fish off of the sandwich and finished it as a bacon/veggie sandwich sans fish.  I decided to give this place a second chance, maybe the last time was a one-off situation. I ordered the grilled chicken cobb sandwich with fries, and experienced deja vu. I took a bite into the sandwich and the whole piece of chicken slid off with it. Again, the flavor was there, the pretzel bun was good. I tried another bite and couldn't get past the rubbery chicken. I again, pulled the piece of chicken off of the sandwich and ended up eating a bacon/veggie sandwich.  If I wanted to eat rubber for dinner, I would just stay at home and gnaw on my dog's Kong. It's too bad because if the fish and chicken were cooked properly, this place would actually be good.",

    "text": "Daily Dose has been on my \"to try\" list for quiet a while, and I'm glad to say it did not disappoint.  I came for brunch on Fourth of July. They had some delicious sounding cocktails and great beers on tap. Unfortunately, I had to go home and study after breakfast so I did not partake. But the happy hour menu looked great, and I will definitely be back to try that. Although I did notice beers are $4 during happy hour, which seems a little high for happy hour. On the bright side, wine is $5 or you can get a bottle for $18. And happy hour is everyday from 4pm to 8pm. If only every happy hour was that long!  I ordered the breakfast nachos- chorizo, eggs, and cheese on tortilla chips. The nachos themselves were pretty good, but a little on the cold side. The portion size is also ridiculous--you could definitely share it with another person. It comes with a side of sausage gravy, which I thought would be weird, but not only was it delicious with the nachos, it was just as good by itself. I will definitely order the biscuits and gravy next time, just so I can have more of that gravy!   My boyfriend ordered the cinnamon apple pancakes. He is a bit of a pancake snob, but he loved these. He was generous enough to share a bite with me, and they are definitely praise worthy. It was like eating apple pie in pancake form.  Our server was great even though she was also working behind the bar. All in all, it was a great breakfast, and I look forward to going back!",

Hardly comes with enough cheese sauce and it costs 75 cents to get more cheese....  However, if you order the chips with salsa and guac, you can have unlimited amount of chips.",

    "text": "I'm from out of state and make it a point to come here at least once every time we're in the area. Food here is normally pretty good. I've been here a handful of times. Can't complain about that part. There's 2 things I wish I would've known before for this particular visit. 1, their specialty coffee drinks really aren't that good so save your money on that. 2, their new menu (or maybe it's their breakfast menu layout) is misleading in my opinion. I went to particularly order gluten free food and ordered a breakfast burger. To my dismay, when the burger arrived it didn't have a gluten free bun, to which I ordered. It arrived on 2 pieces of gluten free bread. I asked the manager that happened who just happened to walk by and he informed me that they no longer have gluten free buns just the gluten bread. Well, then remove it from the menu please. That's misleading and causes frustration for me who didn't know that upon ordering. The other issue I have within their menu is on the breakfast burger I ordered it says \"pick a side\" so I tried to pick a side from their side menu. The waitress (not her fault) informs me that the waffle I wanted was $5 extra. BUT it's in the sides menu and it's a side. Shouldn't it be an option without an extra cost?  The menu doesn't say or restrict otherwise (from what I recall) it literally just says pick a side. So naturally, I look for a sides menu. And think I have free choice because it doesn't say otherwise.  I'm sure I'll be back again. But I'll be more cautious to ask those things.",

Second time coming here and the food is amazing! Order the potatoes they are so delicious. Orange juice freshly squeezed. Food and drink wise is awesome. And the restaurant atmosphere in general is very inviting.    The only negative thing I would have to put is the service here. Both times I've been here the two hostesses have been giggly and unprofessional. When we asked if there were fans on the outside before we sat out there (it's 104 degrees)  she said \"oh no those are for decoration\" sarcastically then turned them on and started giggling with the other hostesses   The waitresses and bartenders are great they just seem to get a bit overwhelmed our food and drinks always came out in a good time. Always by a different person though causing confusion.  Go here great place to eat!",

I've also eaten on the patio as well as in the back part of the restaurant.   The menu has breakfast and lunch -- omelets, sandwiches, salads, etc. I love the bacon omelet. That dish is more than enough to fill you up. It comes with a side (I usually get fruit), bread (I usually get an English muffin), and choice of potato-type starch. The omelet itself has peppered bacon, mozzarella cheese and tomatoes, and is topped with about a quarter of an avocado -- YUM!! I usually get cranberry juice and coffee to wash it down.   On Sundays you can catch several football games on the TVs at the bar. The bartenders have always provided great service.",

The meat was skimpy and unevenly spread on the sandwich and they were cheap with the slaw.  It also seemed like they heated the meat up on the grill because it was super dry and there were parts of it that tasted burnt.  It was utterly disappointing and if that was the first time I'd gotten that entree item I probably would never know how great it could be.  Service was also pretty bad for not being very busy.  I don't think they refilled any of our drinks and I had a watery remnants of coke for half the meal.  The Old Town branch is better with the service as well.",

    "text": "I'm not sure how this place is still in business. This place has so much potential, a nice location and great design. But the service is horrible and the food reminds me of Applebee's.  I was sat on the patio in the dark (lights didn't come on for another 15 minutes) and waited for the server to come by and greet me. Then I waited some more. Finally after 10 min I flagged down a busser to look for him. I could understand if the restaurant was packed but there were only about 8 tables in the whole restaurant and a full wait staff. The server had NO knowledge of the wine list or drink menu. And it took me another 5 minutes to get my coctail and a glass of water.  He knew even less about the menu. Put int he wrong order for the table, but the food actually come out at a decent ticket time even if it was only 1/2 of what the table ordered. The food was just ok, presentaition was pretty decent but there was NO FLAVOR. The server didn't even come by to check on us, so I had to flag another food runner to get the rest of what we had ordered. (I don't know why I even bothered.)  I could stand mediocre food for great service. Likewise, I could stand shoddy service for great food. But this place is hopeless. I thought after being open for a few months they might have worked out a lot of their kinks. Obviously they have a very long way to go.",

I had the signature burger with Harissa aioli on a pretzel bun--moist, juicy, and full of flavor. And I snagged a bite of the hangover cure breakfast sandwich, which was also good. The space was upscale contemporary if a bit too corporate Starbucks-ish for my tastes, but what it lacked in character it made up for with good food and friendly service. Definitely recommended as a solid neighborhood haunt.",

    "text": "Perfect little brunch place! We came in around 1 and decided to sit outside because of the amazing weather that day. Our group of 3 came hungry so we decided to order 2 appetizers and an entree for each of us.   We ordered the nachos and hummus with pita and holy moly the portions are huge! The hummus was pretty average, it was a little too grainy for my liking, but the nachos were great! I bet you're thinking \"how good can nachos be?\" and that's usually my thinking as well but along with the traditional nacho toppings it came with a tomatillo salsa and a white cheese sauce that makes it unique.   For my entree I ordered the breakfast burger with fruit on the side. A side of fruit with a burger may seem insane but when you have so many heavy ingredients such as runny egg yolk, pork sausage, bacon and cheese sauce, something light and refreshing is definitely welcome. Overall the burger was good, with great bacon and nicely cooked runny egg! The only minor issue was that the pork patty itself was very heavily seasoned with paprika and cumin which made it taste like mexican chorizo. It's not necessarily a bad thing but it overpowered the rest of the burger.   Overall a great place for breakfast or lunch and would love to come back again!",

There is outdoor seating with heaters (t was cold and raining) and in door seating. The place at first looks small, but I went to the bathroom and it's quite large.   Our server Susan was excellent. They serve double size mugs of coffee and CUCUMBER WATER!   I got the hash, I would give 3.5 stars, just because it was different than I was expecting, but it was 100% unique. It kind of reminded me of soft brisket. The Toast is the kind you get other places, I got Rye, but they served homemade jam. It reminded me of crush blackberry with no added sugar, VERY GOOD.   I tried some Tempeh my Mom got it was good, and then I got some of my Dad's potatoes, which were tasty.   I would 100% eat here again, they have many unique menu items and as Susan said, everything is made in HOUSE, so that's a reason TO GO! =)",

The house potatoes definitely tasted frozen and some were half way cooked, which wasn't very pleasant. The omelette lacked a lot of flavor, it was extremely bland. I ordered  coffee and not bad (since I am the pickiest when it comes to coffee). My partner ordered a bacon burger and his too lacked a lot of seasoning.    They have a small bar once you walk in and also have a patios to sit outdoors. Currently they are remodeling the frys next door so there's a lot of construction in that are (parking can be a hassle)  All in all daily dose is an ok place I would only stick to eggs Benedict from now on if i were to come back here.",

They greeted us with huge smiles and sat us is a very comfortable booth. Two servers tended to us... Kegan and Sass. Wow!!! They are the best.  I had to try the Sweet Roll Pancake..OMG AGAIN!!! I cannot even describe the \"yummyness\"!! It is a melt-in-your-mouth experience. Good God!! Please try it. It is soooooo good.  And everything was good. You will soon have a new favorite restaurant too. We returned back on Saturday with some new friends to show them what a great place Daily Dose is! Equally as excellent. We are taking friends next Sunday too - they will love it.  10 STARS!  \"The Breakfast Yelper's Crew\"",

He is constantly checking in, attending to any need he sees.   The entire staff seems to really care about your experience there and makes sure to give 100% to their customers.  If you haven't been there yet, I would absolutely recommend stopping by!",

They have an amazing selection of different omelets (bacon, meat & cheese, or the roasted turkey are my favorites), they give you the option of cottage cheese, and their DD hash...don't get me started! My taste buds go wild for this place. The DD hash is a must, it isn't even potatoes, it's SQUASH! Squash?? I know what you're thinking...trust me, it's amazing.   Of course, a breakfast would not be complete without coffee, and their coffee is another perk to this place. It's always fresh and they give you the option of getting syrups (almond is the best).   On some days after my workout I'm feeling extra ris-kay...so I opt for their mixed berry protein pancakes. My first reaction to trying these was to dance in my chair for a good 30 seconds, they are that delicious. Do you tummy a favor and try them! They are huge though, so you can definitely share.",

Others at my table got the prime rib benedict, the breakfast nachos and the berry multigrain pancakes, and all were huge portions. We left full & satisfied.

So I settled for the Caprese Grilled Cheese with a side of Sweet Potato Fries and the waitress so kindly made me an iced chai latte though it was listed as a hot drink only.  Everything was TASTY and the menu is huge. There are so many options to choose from - this is definitely one of those places you have to visit multiple times to not only try breakfast, lunch, AND dinner, but all the different dishes they offer for EACH of those courses.

I also ordered a sugar free white chocolate syrup, which was tasty.  For breakfast my husband had the hangover sandwich. He loved it, and the potatoes that accompanied his sandwich. I had the straight shooter with 2 eggs, meat, fruit and 2 pancakes. I had turkey sausage which was delicious. The star was definitely the pancakes. I had protein pancakes with blueberries. I paid the extra buck for real maple syrup (totally worth it) but the pancakes had such great flavor and texture they didn't require syrup. All in all, a wonderful meal that will tide us over until dinner. Our orders were correct and food was delicious! We will be back.",

I just couldn't put my finger on what it was that didn't click with me.  The server recommended two dishes, I picked the chicken and waffles combo she liked. It came out and the spicy chicken was good, but the jalapeno waffles were way too heavy for that dish. I couldn't eat more than a few bites because it was so heavy.  The Caesar salad came with tomatoes, and it really made the salad good. Too much Parmesan, but that's being picky.  Service was fine, someone new was training in so we had two different people working our booth.   The food and menu were average overall, the execution is just off at this place.",

The breakfast is AMAZING! I could have eaten everyone's meals. I go the Hangover Sandwich-perfect.  The service was also great. They offer a 50% discount to military, but only when in uniform. My husband is military and since it is Memorial day they still took half off the ENTIRE bill for 4 people.  Top notch place.",

There was a bit of a wait to sit inside, but I enjoy sitting outside when the temperatures haven't heated up yet. Very friendly service, the server was very prompt, thorough, kept our water replenished and was attentive but not to the point where it was annoying. Really nice. The food isn't life changing but was tasty, good portions and hit the spot. I ordered the chorizo omelet, with potatoes and butternut squash hash. Good. My bf got the turkey omelet and enjoyed it as well.  The parking lot has a bit of construction right now, so it was a little tricky to find parking. This will probably be resolved in the coming months. Another thing I liked about this place was the diverse crowd. (I enjoy people watching.) There is a gym next door so there's a combination of people from the neighborhood, families, young people, and a few post-workout folks. All in all, I would come back :)",

The biscuits and gravy were ok, not the best and a bit odd in taste-needed salt or seasoning.  I have not tried out their happy hour at this location.

The duck dynasty looking dude at the bar who was getting COMPLETELY WASTED and smelled of alcohol when he walked past us was getting better service. PS it was 12:30 when we were there!!! About 5 people who ordered AFTER us were served their food before ours was ready. When we stood there looking at the bartender with the \"where the fuck is our order\" glare she told us it was being \"boxed up now\". 10 minutes later we got our food.

By the time she came back to check how the food was i was already finished and my plate was taken by the bus boy. Well if you came by earlier you would have know the side of turkey sausage patties was terrible (btw the menu says links). The links use to be some of the best i had, the turkey patties are not even edible.

The staff at Daily Dose is super friendly, quick and even when there is a wait, they provide free (delicious) coffee.

Daily Dose has a pretty extensive (and delicious) lunch menu in addition to its breakfast offerings. One of my personal favorite items is their rosemary potatoes with some incredibly delicious creme fraiche (plus, creme fraiche reminds me of that South Park episode - another plus). While nothing overly stands out, you get a high-quality meal in a clean atmosphere (no sticky, syrup-smelling tables here) with a staff that always is friendly.  The only caveat, be ready for a wait. The location is a bit small and during rush hour, there is often a line out the door. They usually have free water and coffee while you wait, which is very considerate.",

Being from out of town and nearby, the reviews of this place was positive enough for us to check it out.   Here's the downlow: -Service was attentive  -The menu is overwhelming. There's a plethora of choices especially if you're debating breakfast or lunch food.  -The pbj waffle was very filling. Basically peanut butter and jelly on a Belgian waffle. Can't get any complicated than that. It was topped with Alice of bananas too.  -Chicken nachos was a hit at our table. I recommend sharing this because the portion is huge. I wish they had more toppings though. There was more nacho chips.  -Liked that they had a health but section.  Turkey sausage whiteout was average. I didn't think the turkey sausage was very flavorful. It reminded me of elementary crumbled sausage served during lunch. The fruit side was plentiful and I was able to sub out the toast for butternut squash which was good.   I recommend as a breakfast, brunch, lunch spot.",

I ordered the poblano and polenta cakes eggs Benedict and I really enjoyed it.  I am a savory breakfast gal and I love anything with a Mexican flare.  I wasn't a huge fan of their potatoes...there was an herb in there I wasn't digging.  But that's just personal preference. I also tried some of my hubby's biscuits and gravy which were very good and very unique.   Good sized portions and good prices.  The kids enjoyed waffles and pancakes so I got to sample both and they were both DELICIOUS!  Obviously this was a splurge kind of day but they have many healthy options and I look forward to returning to try them out.   Service was friendly and fantastic!",

    "text": "I have been to Daily Dose twice in the past week and it has been wonderful both times!  Lindsey was our server at our first visit and she was awesome!  The food was hot and delicious and everything was wonderful! I have worked in the food and beverage business for 30+ years and I love when a restaurant matches up to expectations.  I have recently moved to Arizona and am looking for a position that fits.  I felt that the DD and I would be a good match up.  So, I talked with Lindsey about it and she informed me that there were some possible upcoming positions at the DD.  She gave me an application and told me to try and come in on Saturday and she would give the manager (Allen)  a heads up.  I could not make it on Saturday, but I called Allen and explained who I was.  He asked me to come in on either Sunday or Monday after 2pm.  Yesterday (Monday), I did just that.   I walked in, introduced myself, handed Allen my application and resume and also told him I would be having lunch.  He told me that he had a interview coming in but that he would come over and speak with me when he was done.   That NEVER happened.  I didn't see him interviewing anyone, but he could have been doing that in a different part of the restaurant.  I waited for nearly an hour for him to come over and he never did.  I kept standing up to see where he was and he was standing at the bar each time.  How DISAPPOINTING!   If he didn't think that I would be a fit for DD, all he had to do was say so.  In all my years of management, I have never blown anybody off like that.  What an awful representation for the DD.  Little does he know, that I would have been such an asset to his team.  I am positive, energetic and love making connections with others.  I love the Food and Beverage Business and am passionate about customer service, team work and making the best of each day.   I'm sorry that Allen treats people in this way.  I hope he decides to take the time to get to know what people have to offer and finds the right people for his establishment.",

We got here about 9:15 and decided to sit at the bar since we had a movie to get to.  Pros  ~Food made just the way you order it..I'm very particular about the way my bacon is cooked    and they made it just how I liked it without having to send it back  ~Never an empty cup...whether it was coffee or water my cup was always topped off ~AMAZING bloody Mary's... The blood Mary was so good that I ordered just the mix so I could take it home and enjoy one at home ~Super friendly staff.. The server knew we were going to the movie and was kind enough to put ice in a plastic bag so I could keep the bloody Mary mix on ice... NOW THAT\"S SERVICE!!!  Cons ~Depending on how large your party and what time you get there you may have to wait a little bit. I personally have never had to wait since I'm usually just a plus 1  Overall Daily Dose Midtown gets 4 stars looking forward to coming back soon!",

She would drop off the food without a word. We asked for jam for bread. She looked at us.  Walked away. Returned with jam. No words exchanged. Lol.

After reviewing the extensive menu I decided on the Cobb Sandwich which was a delicious grilled chicken breast with blue cheese, lettuce, tomato and I'm probably leaving a few things off, on a pretzel bun. It came with a side (but I was accidentally offered two) of which I chose the sweet potato hash (cubed sweet potatoes, mushrooms and onions), and a side of fruit.  I thought everything was delicious. Would I go back? Absolutely. I caught a peek at someone's salad and it looked amazing. Huge, but amazing. I can't wait to try one next time.",

    "text": "Everything on this menu looks so darn good. I was debating bt the hangover sandwich and the mixed berry pancakes. Waitress suggested sandwich bc she doesn't like waffles. Apparently I picked the two most popular items.  Sandwich just ok. I thought it would have been more bold in flavor after reading the descrip - bacon, sausage, aioli type sauce, caramelized jalapenos and onions. Nothing really stood out to me.  But that won't stop me from going back to try others.  Saw a pic of the breakfast nachos and they look AMAZING.  Another  waitress said it was the best thing in the menu so will have to see how legit that recommendation is. Will have to try that and my pancakes next time.  They have this ginger snap granola that I got to sample. Pretty yummy considering I am not a fan of granola.  Service was interesting. In the beg and all the way up to when our food was served, we had people constantly checking up on us. But once our food was served, I only saw our waitress once during the entire meal.  Not even the other two people who were so good about helping us. It took forever to find one of them to get our check. And we had sat there for a good 5-10 minutes after we finished eating. Weird inconsistency.  We'll see how it goes the 2nd time.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this place for a long time.  Last week was my chance.  Some friends wanted to grab dinner, so we decided on Daily Dose Midtown.  When we arrived it was pretty quiet. It was a Saturday night so I was a little surprised.  Our waitress was nice but slightly flaky.  Every time we asked her a question and she didn't know the answer, she tried to guess the answer rather than just asking someone. Especially when it came to a friend asking about something she is allergic to. She gave us incorrect information on the portion size of an appetizer and she forgot a few things like my friends beer and then said \"Oh that's my fault\" when he asked if it was coming.  This all went on when it was pretty slow so that to me is either a sign of someone new (which that didn't seem to be the case) or someone just being lazy because it's a slow night.  Her personality was a bit too casual too.  Just enough to be boarder line unprofessional. Not a big deal, it was just noticeable.    The food was ok.  I had a hamburger and I asked for it Medium,  I got what seemed to me to be medium well or even well done. There wasn't any pink at all.  The pretzel bun also seemed kind of dry.  At this point I wasn't going to bother bringing it up to the waitress.    What all seem like bad things, I just had a feeling it was the staff of that night.  The following week some coworkers wanted to go there for lunch so we did.  I figured this would give me an idea of this place.  Right off the service was MUCH better.  Our waitress was attentive and got everything right.  Just her demeanor and professionalism seemed a lot better. The food improved too and it was all in all a better experience.  I think our first time here was a case of the lazy restaurant workers who just didn't want to be there on a Saturday night.   Would I recommend?  Yes, give it a try.  I think I really want to try brunch.",

I was really looking forward to moist soft pretzels with some great cheese... the cheese was watery and was not enough for the very dry pretzel.  It really needed salt and butter to make it taste more than just plain bread, or much more cheese to dip it in.  The chorizo mac and cheese sounded delicious and like it would be somewhat spicy, but it was VERY bland.  When I added salt, it wasn't as bad... but it was still very meh.  Not remotely spicy or flavorful.  For the price (I spent 18 bucks on these two things), I've definitely had better.  Which bums me out, I've been wanting to try this place since they opened as their menu sounded delicious, with many things that I thought I would love.  Happy hour prices were meh.  5 dollar margaritas, 3.75 well, which are comparable or more expensive than any other bar in the area.  Not really worth my time again, and glad I didn't take my boyfriend as he would have likely complained about paying for that.  Did not try the breakfast... which is what everyone seems to be raving about.  If you're going, try it for that but skip the dinner menu for sure.",

I am pretty sure calling a restaurant to let them know I received food poisoning from eating at their establishment does not fall into the feedback category usually associated with service, etc. Needless to say I was very disappointed in their utter disregard to my phone call and their dis concern for their patron's health. I will not be back to DD again and will definitely be telling all my friends and family to avoid the Highland location!",

The chorizo Mac n cheese made me want to lick the bowl after we finished an appetizer portion of it. I kind of did, but in a classy way- with my finger! ;) it's that good! The turkey burger was the best I have had in a long time. The pretzel bun is incredible! I finally had breakfast there and it was to die for! Breakfast nachos and a peanut and jelly waffle with syrup and bananas? Yes please! It was a bit much, but we had to do it! There were so many other things on the breakfast menu that I wanted it was hard to decide. I wouldn't do the nachos again by myself, but would definitely split them with others. I want to try some of the mouthwatering omlette's next time. Too many good choices here, they have me hooked.",

    "text": "Been wanting to try this place for awhile now, so finally did this morning. Must say first impressions are everything for a business including how their employees conduct themselves while providing customer service. Ambiance was great and inviting when we walked through the front entrance. There was not host or hostess attending the front door, but a customer who we saw walked in as we pulled in the parking lot. He was standing there patiently waiting with no acknowledgement from the moment he walked in, as we began to experience the same lack of service. I then walked back to the bar to get some service for seating for this gentlemen and our party as well only to be confronted by the rudest person in the establishment. She was rude all the way to sitting us and made it known to her fellow employees, my wife wanted to walk out and go somewhere else, but I decide to stay and ride it out and give them a chance. She made a lot of excuses and was rude even further when we requested a booth over a high top, this employee has a lack of situational awareness and forgot that this is solely a customer service driven industry. Businesses such as this on relies heavily on reviews and word of mouth such as this. She became a liability and not an asset to this business this morning, who obviously made the investment in her employment.  So part two of this review, our server was friendly and the food was delicious but a little on the cooler side. The food probably sat in the back for awhile before it came out at that temperature, which is usually the case for cooler food. So I am torn about this restaurant, which is too bad because the food tasty. I think that the management here is due for a staff meeting to tighten up the ship. The place was only half way to capacity to not have any of these device issues this morning.  There are plenty of great restaurants in this Central Phoenix area that truly nail it every time. Unfortunately this was not that day for The Daily",

I should have taken that as a sign to leave. The food I ordered was terrible and did not taste good at all. There was absolutely no flavor and our waitress was giving us a lot of attitude like she didn't want to be there. I was very disappointed with this experience as I did not have high expectations but the standard definitely want meet and feel way below what I was paying for. My portion of the meal came to $35 so I wasn't spending chip change, so understand a little on why I was frustrated with the experience. I'd say if you hate waiting and want food quick, this place can fill that void, even though the food may not be good.",

    "text": "Alright kids, let's cut straight to the chase here; Daily Dose (Double D) Midtown is without question our (my wife and I's) favorite, guaranteed great experience eatery in the PHX metro area.  My wife and I do a great deal of international traveling for work and fun, which means our exposure to amazing food is prevalent. And as a former 300lb man, I can assure you that my addiction to food is, surely, only marginalized when compared to a toothbrush armed meth-head focused on a filthy grout line. Food is my black-tar, and Double D is my Syringe.   Now, I'm not going to insult any of the other foodies out there by trying to compare Double D to a 5-Star experience, because it's not - neither in presentation or atmosphere, but what it does have is unrivaled consistency, creativity, and made-in-house goodness. The customer service experience is always exceptional, helping to reinforce our love for Dub-D-Delight!  Let's talk food. Avocado covered Bacon Omelette...Dope. Made-in-House berry preserves...Redic. Taste bud-gasmic made-in-house ketchup....WHAT!? Unicorn Tusk infused Buttermilk pancakes (slightest crunch on the outside, soft and magical on the inside)...Sensational. Egg white omelette with made-in-house turkey sausage...mind=blown! Protein pancakes that don't make you call into question your decision to pretend to be healthy...legit! Pretzel bun'd - Angel tear glazed Daily Dose Burger intoxication...radical.   If you like witty repartee with wait staff, managers, and owners who like to laugh and are not afraid to share their honest opinions about life, their bat shit crazy dogs, travel, and just about any mildly offensive topic of choice  - then this is your mutha friggin holy land. Really great people, with really great attitudes.   If you are are a quiet, pretentious recluse who is used to consuming boxed waffles and drinking syrup from the bottle, then stay away - for you will surely be disappointed by the annoying fact that DD is not located in a graveled trailer park lot.   The best thing I can say about Daily Dose, is that we keep coming back for more. We bring friends, family, and colleagues with us as often as possible, and the results are always the same; complete satisfaction.  Keep doing you DD - and we will continue to publicly glutton ourselves in your house of worship. ;)",

To politely dispute the bill, I kindly reminded the waitress of the earlier exchange and she said that she would remove the cost of the entree from my bill.  Rather than follow thru on her promise, the waitress wrote me a note saying that she had discounted the entree by half rather than 100%!

I ordered the turkey sausage and polenta bowl and my friend ordered the steak and potatoes were both had huge portions. Our drinks and food took a little longer than expected but we were busy talking so it passed time.   We will definitely be back!",

The husband had the biscuits and gravy and didn't care for that either. I think the food here may be very hot and miss, with some items being really great and others falling flat, which is rough when their price point isn't so cheap.

    "text": "I find that I tend to look at breakfast joints with a touch of extra scrutiny in part because the definition of what constitutes breakfast is often set in people's minds.  And sure, breakfast can be different things to different people whether its an omelet, pancakes, toast, cereal, or whatever.  But when you get down to it, there are three types of breakfast spots.  Those that are resolutely old school (i.e. Mike & Ronda's The Place, Mel's Diner, etc.), those that try to innovate (Zookz, Pomegranate Cafe, etc), and those somewhere in between.  Daily Dose seems to fit the somewhere in between category.  Having driven by Daily Dose's central Phoenix location for years, it was time to finally pay a visit at opening on Saturday.  Located just off the 51 freeway on the north side of Highland and 22nd Street, Daily Dose's Phoenix location has a laid back neighborhood feel from the moment you walk in.  The restaurant isn't particularly large, but can pretty comfortably pack in upwards of 100 patrons at a time.  Matt and JenLyn Long are the proprietors of Daily Dose which opened its flagship restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale almost a decade ago and the menu at their central Phoenix hub is identical to the one in Scottsdale.  With every breakfast spot I goto I'm looking for items that really stand out on the menu versus other breakfast spots.  Oftentimes I can pick them out myself, but some restaurants will steer you themselves by highlighting their own specialty items on the menu.  And it just so happens that Daily Dose circled one menu item in particular that they seem to take great pride in.  I've had chicken and waffles at plenty of establishments before including the iconic original Lo-Lo's in Downtown.  Daily Dose' Chicken & Waffles does their own spin on the dish.  The chicken is encrusted with bacon and fried, the waffle is a corn waffle and the toppings include two eggs your way (scrambled for me), corn salsa and harissa aioli.  And of course syrup to pour on top if you want (which I did).  I decided to get a side of DD's house made hash as well as a bowl of fruit.  And of course some fresh squeezed orange juice to wash it all down.  Total cost including tip came to about $25.  It should be said that the portion size of this dish will satisfy pretty much anyone's appetite as the waffle and chicken were both huge, and I certainly didn't leave hungry.  That said, this dish was far from perfect in my opinion.  I'm fine with a waffle that has a nice soft chewy inside, but I like a nice crispy exterior to go with it.  Unfortunately the exterior of this waffle was just as soft, thus giving the waffle more of a texture of pre-toasted bread than a waffle.  No complaints about the chicken or the aioli as both were delicious.  If you love corn, you'll probably love this dish in its entirety.  For me, it might've been a bit of corn overload between the corn waffle and the corn on top.  Even with the syrup, I didn't get much of the sweet savory punch I'd hoped for with this dish.  The other disappointment for me was the hash, which was basically equal parts onions, mushrooms, and potatoes.  If that's your thing, go for it.  Me?  I'm not a mushroom guy and would much prefer just a scant amount of onions and some corn beef or other filler as a substitute for the mushrooms.  The fruit bowl was solid with a variety of different fresh fruits and the orange juice was plenty satisfying.  Overall an okay, but somewhat disappointing first impression.  I'm quite confident in Daily Dose's ability to deliver a good meal on the more traditional fare they offer including the omelets, benedicts, and their assortment of healthy breakfast items.  But in terms of the more innovative stuff, I'll need to see some improvement over the meal I had this go around.  All of which is not to say you should stay away from Daily Dose, but rather just approach the non-traditional fare with caution.  And if you want my two cents, skip the hash.  Hopefully the next time I'm here for breakfast (or lunch) my meal will be up to par with the aesthetics of this neighborhood staple.",

We were 7 of us and I'll highlight the general experience, but I'll focus on my dish more than others'. I ordered the turkey sausage white out off of the health nut section. I substituted the toast with butternut squash. The meal also comes with fruit.   Tasty, delicious, healthy and filling. I enjoyed it Thoroughly and cleaned my plate. It was a busy day, but service was pretty consistent. I also ordered pomegranate green tea and it was refreshed and replenished in a timely manner. One thing that was disappointing is that my meal came with no fruit and server noticed it right away and instead of bringing a bowl of fruit, took my large bowl of butternut squash,  and came back with a smaller bowl of butternut squash and a large bowl of fruit. Didn't make sense to me, but wasn't the end of the world. All in all the food is delicious, and service was consistent.",

It became our spot and the place we always take friends and family! The \"strawberries and creme brulee waffles\" dish is my go to entree on the menu and definitely a favorite! This is probably my favorite restaurant, I recommend everyone here! Our favorite waitress, Jess; the server, and Alan; thee manager are also simply some of the most amazing friendly people as well!

When I want a nice, hearty, extra healthy brunch or breakfast I opt for First Watch.  Any who .... I've been to Daily Dose more times than I can count.  Doesn't matter if I'm dining with 1 other person or 4, there's always a small wait.  No longer than 10 - 15 minutes.  If you're alone, you can definitely find a seat at the bar. The omelets looks delicious.  I've honestly never tried them only because they're made with 3 eggs and 3 egg omelets are way too much for me.  I've tried the Steak & Potato Bowl and the Turkey Sausage & Polenta Bowl.  Those two are my favorites.  Along with the biscuits and gravy, banana bread French toast and the Southwest Wrap.  I've ordered those things over and over again ... never get tired.    I branched out recently and ordered Steak & Eggs, fried eggs with herb potatoes and a biscuit.  I ordered my steak medium.  I received a very well steak.  I sent it back.  The server was very apologetic.  Because my friend and I had plenty of Mimosas and plenty of other food to eat I didn't mind waiting for the steak.  The manager (I believe) was kind enough to bring the steak out to me himself once it was ready. It was juicy, cooked perfectly and sooooo tasty.  I enjoyed it and I'm adding it to my list of favorite Daily Dose dishes",

To top this sinful splurge off what do they bring you to dip your nachos in?? Gravy !

Last time I went for a meeting and our server was fine but she did not seem like a happy person.  Usually business will strive if they have employees who enjoy being around people.  Also one of my colleagues asked for a diet coke mid meal... And then she asked 2 other random people after a while and then those people sent our server back over to ask if she can get us anything.  Why did they not just tell her to bring a damn diet coke????  So my friend is like A DIET COKE please.  If the servers could work as a team and help each other out for the good of the customer it would benefit the customer and business for sure.  I felt bad for our server because she has no help!",

And their Happy Hour has a pretty vast selection for both food and drink. And the pretzel rolls...oh the pretzel rolls. Almost all burgers and sandwiches come on them, thankfully!  Service has always been great, and the food is awesome! Especially breakfast. Lots and lots of options!  We've been to both locations and they are both equally good. But for some reason, other than breakfast this location doesn't ever seem to be as busy; I don't understand why. If you are looking for a new place to try - DO IT! You won't be disappointed.",

I love turkey burgers, so I was SUPER excited. She promised that it was like omg SO good. It wasn't. It was horrible.  I am convinced that they were trying to get rid of soon to be expiring turkey or that she gets some kind of turkey burger bonus.   The ugly: we ordered nachos for the table.  They brought the nachos out and we started eating. They came back a few minutes later and said that our plate was actually a special order for another table.  THEY TOOK OUR PARTIALLY EATEN PLATE OF NACOS AND GAVE THEM TO THE RIGHT TABLE.  I wish I was kidding but thIs actually happened. You could tell that our plate had been picked at as well.    That has to be the craziest thing that's ever happened to me at a restaurant.  None of us could believe that happened.  So gross.",

We were pretty much the only ones in there. But they let us know right away that we were just in time for happy hour (woohoo!). So we each ordered a drink (he had a beer and then a specialty coffee, I had 3 spiked arnold palmers). The drinks were fantastic! Our waitress was also the bartender, which was cool. We also ordered a couple soft pretzels to start us off. OMG they were good! Super soft with 2 different delicious dipping sauces. Soooo good. Then, we ordered a veggie burger on a pretzel bun and split it. It was big, the waitress put it on two plates for us, we didn't even ask! Super sweet of her. It comes with ketchup and two other sauces. I think one was a cucumber sauce, and the other was just delicious. I have no idea what it is.  We hung out and people watched for a few hours. There was some good people watching to be had. The place was pretty mellow, and right down the street from our house. I'm hesitant to put more great details because I really like this place and don't want it to blow up. lol But I will say, we will definitely be going again.",

In fact, I found the happy hour prices to be pretty comparable to other bar's normal prices for beers, snacks, etc.  We ordered a few beers.  They were good.  Beer = good.  We ordered chicken skewers and pretzels as snacks.  I thought the pretzels were sub par (though I do always compare pretzels to the mall pretzels... mmm... butter = good) Chicken skewers were a bit on the rubbery side.

We were at a table and I was surprised by how busy it was in here.  Food: I had the Rueben sandwich with apple sauerkraut. I asked the server before ordering it if it was grilled; she said it was. It was definitely not grilled, but rather between two pieces of marble rye toast. The overall flavor was nice: corned beef was well seasoned, the sauerkraut was sweet and tangy, and the sauce was nice, but I wanted more. The cheese, if there was any (I couldn't tell), was paltry. Those that know this sandwich know that it is like a grilled cheese with corned beef, sauerkraut, and thousand island dressing. But this one at least had a nice twist with some green chiles. The fries were pretty good, too.  Service: our server was very sweet and efficient.   I may come back and give it another shot because it is close by.  That will determine whether   I keep this rating or change it. I usually either really like or hate a place and this place was neither good or bad.",

I guess it helps that I came here in super starvation mode, so the generous portion here earns an automatic 2 stars. I got the Roasted Turkey omelette, which comes with 3 eggs (I got egg whites...ugh, healthy), your choice of toast, potato, and (thats right, \"and\" not \"or\") fruits. The potato is where Daily Dose earns its other 2 stars. It was a much appreciated surprise to see deliciously chopped and baked (fried? cooked? i dont know..) potatoes that compliment my omelette so well. Their multigrain toast also tasted a lot better than it sounds. I love it when my stupid decision to go for the \"healthy\" option does not taste healthy at all!!! For the price, I'm pretty sure I won this round.  They have outside seating, which is awesome in this Phoenix weather. Inside looks nice too. Not to mention, they have a Frys grocery store right next door, and a gas station in the same parking lot..SO I got all my errands done in one spot...pretty darn effective if you ask me.",

When we first walked in we did not see a hostess or a sign that stated please wait to be seated, so we took it upon ourselves to sit where ever.  We were then met by someone that asked if we were being helped and we said no.  She said we normally have a hostess, but she was no where to be found.  We both thought that the person that greeted us had a bit of an attitude?    Our waitress, she had a great attitude and made our stay very entertaining.",

    "text": "I had very low expectations just going in: this looks revolting from the outside. I was quite surprised by the indoors, however. Very swanky and clean! Modern! Nice lighting.   The good: The dining room. Already went over that. Honorable mention: The service. Our server was quick, attentive and kind.   The bad: The food. I had the green chili chicken enchiladas. Horrifically over seasoned! Every bite was like trying to swallow a forkful of pepper. The enchiladas sat in my stomach like a pair of squeamish bricks that are too afraid to touch each other. Very unsettling.   On way out, I had the chance to get a good look at the kitchen area. Not the cleanest kitchen in the world, people. And one of the prep cooks was chewing gum. Unacceptable.    I should have followed my gut instinct and stayed away from this oh-too-familiar bar food cuisine. That's what I get for trying something I was leery about to begin with! I ate over six hours ago and my stomach is still hating me.   The two stars are for the cleanliness (of the dining room ONLY) and for the servers.",

    "text": "How did I not know they put this in?!? The husband and I really enjoy the location in Old Town, but we try to avoid that area as much as possible. So we were thrilled to see they put in a new restaurant closer to our hood.   First of all, let me start by saying that we had some of the best service we've ever received during our lunch here. Our server was casual and friendly, without being overwhelming. He was always strolling by to check on us...we didn't even have to wait for refills. The atmosphere of the place is definitely what I picture when I think of a breakfast joint (even though we were here for lunch). It's cozy, comfortable, and clean. The patio looks awesome, but it was way too hot to try that out this time around. The other thing that will keep me coming back is the menu. They have so many options that look so good! This time around I had the caprese grilled cheese and my husband tried an omelet. Both were super tasty and very filling. We also started with their chips, salsa, and guac,,,also very good.   All in all, we really like this place and we're so happy they're close by now. I'll definitely be back again...for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I love the variety of items they serve in a relaxed environment. Thanks for the great meal and awesome service!",

The place was really cute, contemporary and nice vibe, played a good variety of music.  They have seating in the bar area and a dining area with tables and booths.  I ordered the fried polenta (was OK), roasted veggie grilled cheese w/ sweet potato fries (IT WAS THE BOMB) and I had a pomegranate green tea (THE BEST TEA).  My friend had the panko crust chicken fingers - I had one and it was delish!  For all that, my bill was $15, which is not bad!  Next time we go, we're going to try something else - the menu is great, and they serve breakfast too!  I recommend this place to anyone.  Great food and great service! :)",

All of the food is made in house, they have a nice variety on the healthy side, truly savory options for the not so healthy side ;) I highly recommend the banana bread French toast, it's incredible & not too sweet at all! I love the unique DD hash as a side dish; butternut squash, onion, potato and light seasoning = heavenly. Also recommend the Eggs Benedict & NEW BBQ sandwich melt, even their side salads are a generous portion & very fresh! I've met friends for brunch (mimosas & bloody Mary's are great) & even brought my dog on the side patio for a quick bite. You have to check this place out!",

The Bloody Mary I ordered was horrible. Very watered down and tasted like they put a shot of olive juice in it. I asked if she could spice it up which she tried to do. It didn't help. I ordered the southwestern wrap, it was ok. The avocado's were not ripe and had seed peal left on them. My husband had a burger..it was ok, nothing great.  Overall, service wasn't up to par nor was the food...to many other good choices around. Don't think I'll be back.",

    "text": "Review for brunch only...  I woke up on a Sunday morning craving food. I woke up my roommate and used bribery and peer pressure to get him to agree to come out  for brunch. I told him pancakes fix hangovers. I even offered to buy his meal. He said he'd go, and all I had to buy was his first Bloody Mary! DEAL! It happened to be Easter Sunday. I called another restaurant and confirmed they were open, and called Daily Dose - was told they'd be open until 2. Since we can walk to Daily Dose, we opted to check it out. I also called and invited one of my favorite coworkers, who decided to meet us there.  The roomie and I started with Bloody Marys, waters and a coffee for me. The server then came back and asked the roommate for his ID. I asked if she wanted mine, too. She did not. BAD FORM! Unless I looked old enough to be his mother (I do not!), we should have both been carded. Servers should know this...it's the kind of thing that is reflected in the tip!  All the food was fresh and tasty - portions were ginormous. Crab cake Benedict is one of my new favorite things. Roomie had a burger that he was happy with, and a pancake on the side (gotta love hangover decisions!) I don't remember what the coworker had - I believe it was one of the omelets. We were all quite happy with the flavors, quality and quantity of our selections.  The server managed to make a boo-boo on the check. After my roommate and I had our cards run and my coworker had received her change, she came back to the table to inform me that she forgot to put my coffee on the bill - and what should she do? I was totally thrown off by this and answered (probably with more snark than needed in my tone) \"wow! looks like you just bought my coffee! thank you!.\" Seriously? AFTER the bill is paid, you're coming back to tell me you forgot the single cheapest item ordered - the one that cost the restaurant less than a dime, and you think *I* should do something about that?   I am sure I'll give DD another shot. The location and menu is too convenient and appealing to pass up entirely. But no matter how great the crab cake Bene was, I left with a bad taste in my mouth and felt regret I hadn't pushed for the other restaurant instead.",

The first two times my husband and I attempted to order omelettes.  There was no combination on the menu that we liked so we attempted to order an omelette \"our way\" but both times we were served an omelette off the menu and we told that they could not vary the ingredients.  I am very surprised that there are not negative comments about this restaurant's bacon.  You have no choice but to order \"peppered bacon\" even if you prefer it without pepper........and there is loads of pepper on this bacon!  It would be in the best interest of their customers if they offered their bacon with or without pepper!!  Since we consider bacon a basic breakfast staple, we will not be back to Daily Dose.  This appears to be a better plan for breakfast for those who prefer pancakes or waffles.  The pancakes are huge and our group members that order pancakes regularly , loved them.",

The DD hash was unique and I enjoyed the flavor.   The service was quick, there are seats indoors, by the bar, and out in the patio. There's also plenty of parking.

Our waiter was very attentive and more than willing to accommodate us even going so far as to offer a sample of their not-Pepsi or Coke brand soda.   All in all, the omelette I had was packed with meat but dry and somewhat bland. The home fries were unspectacular, the bread even a little tough.   Perhaps I should have tried the benedict instead.",

    "text": "Well.... being we are regulars here and we love it I'm very sad to update my review. But today we had a pretty negative experience here with the service. We eat here I'd say 3 times a week. Every Saturday for sure. We have grown to know many of the people working there including the manager. Today we came in about 915am it wasn't super busy but there wasn't many tables. The girl that works the door is just not friendly and every time we go in a I get a rather rude vibe from her. Well she tells us \"i need a min\" not hello or anything just that. So they sat another table and came back to seat us. Now the host didn't set us the manager did. Aaron. So he offers us a table in the middle of the restaurant, my boyfriend and I wanting to enjoy our breakfast and having some business we were looking to go over we asked if we could wait for a booth. Aaron seemed to be annoyed by our request. So we went back to the front to wait. We got seated at a new booth. We sat for about 5 to 10 mins and  Aaron finally brought over some water for us not saying a thing just dropping it on the table in a rude manner and walking off. So at this point being we come here all the time we didn't need to look at the menu we were ready to order but the waitress who we both saw the waitress get drinks as take everyone else's table. I let it go the first time. But the 2nd time she came to our section she attended every table and yet again walked right by us not saying a thing. At this point I'm annoyed and say to my boyfriend I feel like i want to leave we have been here 20 mins at this table with a server walking past us 3 times not acknowledging us one time I just want to leave. Well Aaron either overhearing me say this or just seeing our body language came over to say \"has anyone taken your drink order?\" Me saying \"no no one has said a thing to us since we sat here\" my boyfriend asks me at that point if I want to leave. I say \"yes\" Aaron did say at that time. \"Ill get something going for you guys\" I told him no thank you. You see us 2 or more times a week and this is the service you give. He said sorry and seemed to not be happy about us leaving but at this point we were hungry had been here for 40 mins and no sign of being able to eat or even order. The demeanor of the host and the manager seemed off and rude. We are very nice people and were just blown away. I'm sad to do this update but today our view changed on the service here and there are other daily doses we will go to from here on out.",

    "text": "This was my first time visiting Daily Dose and I think I got really lucky!  I went for brunch on a Sunday and only had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table on the patio.  The main reason for the 5 stars is because I had one of the best veggie burgers of my life!  If you follow my other reviews, you will see that I'm a big supporter of quality veggie burgers and I try them everywhere I go.  This one was definitely memorable and moves into my top 3 in Phoenix.  The patty is homemade with tasty grains and herbs - not frozen or too hard.  The bun is a fatty delicious pretzel bun which is fantastic but probably not the healthiest option.  It comes with a great yogurt dill sauce that gives it a little Mediterranean flare.  Or it with waffle fries if you're feeling crazy!    If you don't like veggie burgers.... you can't go wrong with any of their pancakes, omelets or breakfast nachos!",

When I asked the waitress what was going on, she said she forgot to tell us about the price differences. The restaurant changed prices.  It was not one item but several items.   Needless to say 10 people will no longer frequent this place.Different prices from menus to bills is shady business.",

Our waitress was on top of her game, providing prompt and friendly service, with other staff jumping in periodically to clean and refill drinks!  The ambiance of the establishment is very casual, with an old school diner vibe accented with modern elements. The brunch menu here is extensive! So many tasty options to choose from. I ended up getting the chicken and waffles. It did not disappoint! The way they designed the dish was very unique and different - providing a south west chipotle style with corn. Definitely try it out, for a new twist on a traditional dish! The drink menu is pretty standard for brunch, offering a lot of tasty options. All of their items are generously portioned at a good price point.  All in all, the unique dishes, incredible service, short wait times, and generous portions of this establishment have contributed to a wonderful brunch experience. I will be coming back.",

My boyfriend loves sweet breakfast dishes, so he had many to choose from. He went with the s'mores cakes. The dish included three big chocolate chip pancakes topped with marshmallow and chocolate icing - so delicious. It was so decadent and tasted like a dessert!! I, on the other hand, love savory breakfasts, so I chose the green chili pork omelette. It comes with potatoes, toast (I chose sourdough), and I chose the DD hash as my third side (butternut squash and mushrooms). The omelette was so flavorful. The menu here is so big that we will have to be back to try something new!",

I had the breakfast nachos which were delicious. Has egg and chorizo, pico de gallo salsa, cheese, and I added a side of guacamole. The chorizo and salsa is what made the dish.  They've got a large selection of breakfast and lunch items, so I definitely need to come back to try more.   The customer service here is awesome. My mom has to adhere to a gluten free diet, and they're extremely accommodating and knowledgeable about what people with diet restrictions should/shouldn't eat.   On top of all that, our waitress-Stephanie-went above and beyond for us. She recommended a dish for my mom, and when it came out, the pancakes were too salty. So Stephanie took the food back to the kitchen without question, and recooked her order. But before she brought out the new food, the chef made a new batch of batter and had her try it to make sure it tasted right before now bringing it the order to my mom. Now if that's not customer service at its finest, idk what is.   Highly impressed, glad we came here for brunch.",

I had to put alot of green hot sauce on everything. Hot sauce makes everything better!  The house hash was really good.  That was my favorite.  My spouse had the vegan breakfast burrito, and said everything was mush and you couldn't taste what was what. Maybe we came on a off day.  But overall we were underwhelmed.",

I think the only thing I was \"eh\" about was their avocado toast, the bread wasn't toasted too much making the bread a little bit soggy. The omelets I've tried here all tastes good, I don't think you can go wrong with any of them. I especially enjot the caprese and turkey sausage.  For lunch, I would order the smoked cheddar chicken which is filling! It's a pretty big sandwich. And my favorite, the chorizo mac 'n cheese as a side. I sometimes crave the mac n' cheese out of nowhere, especially in the evenings :( (when they're closed). That is the only bummer about this place is that they're only opened until 3pm. Also, their chicken nachos is very good! The two cheese that comes with it are so goood!!! I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT.",

I'm happy to say that my next visit was the complete opposite!  We were seated quickly and the servers and I'm assuming this person was a manager was super nice!    I have only tried the appetizers and have been pleased with those. I had the pretzels and the jalapeno chorizo mac n cheese.  The pretzels were pretty good.  It comes with two tasty dips, but the mac n cheese is to die for!  I could eat that dis everyday!  I even took a second order home for my husband to try.  I ended up eating that one too!    Their happy hour prices are pretty good.  I love having so many options!  I will be back!",

I was changing Baby C's diaper in the bathroom and well, let's just say that his whole outfit needed to be changed.  Oh and the ladies bathroom had a diaper changing station!  So helpful for patrons with little ones still in diapers!  Anyway....By the time I finished cleaning him up and got back to our table.  Our food had already been dropped off.  BUT, my food was no where in sight.  The waitress asked J if she could put my order back up on the pass so it would stay hot.  So when I got back to our table, a minute later, my breakfast arrives.    My breakfast - Peanut Butter and Jelly Pancakes!  Super tasty!    As we were getting ready to leave, I asked our waitress if we could have to go cups for our drinks (my water and J's soda).  She not only brought cups, but they were filled with our beverages.    Seriously awesome grub and service!!",

Most of our go-tos stop serving breakfast around 1-2pm and we didn't really want to be, \"those customers.\" So we Yelped some options.   Daily Dose was one of the first to come up in the area and wow, served breakfast until 4pm on weekends! So we went.   I was so surprised when we walked in. There are indoor and outdoor seating sections, really friendly staff, and wow (again) so many options on the menu! We started by each ordering a bloody mary and then proceeded to take forever to choose from the many options. Again, I am soooo glad they serve breakfast later, as there never felt as if there was a rush for us to order. I finally decided on a Belgian waffle which turned out amazing. Upon receiving our check, prices were great too. Really awesome place.   I will definitely be back here! So many, \"wows!\"",

I understand that breakfast places are super popular, but who actually wants to wait over an hour to eat?  So we decided to try our luck elsewhere. This brought us to the Daily Dose. We were promptly seated and our server was over in a timely manner. We order the quesadilla, portabella mushroom (breakfast menu), and the turkey omelet. The food was delicious! We had so much left over, we were able to have breakfast the next day.   It seems like the Daily Dose has a lot of different drink specials.. we didn't try them since we were craving coffees, but I would like to go back to check them out.   Overall I highly recommend Daily Dose.. I'm not sure I will try to go back to Snooze since I know that there is a great breakfast place down the street that doesn't make you wait over an hour.",

    "text": "I came in here for the first time with a friend on Memorial Day sine we were both off work and thought'd we'd grab brunch.  The restaurant was crowded, inside and out.  I usually dont like staying at places to eat when it is terribly busy but decided to just stay and try it out.    The server approached our table and asked for our drink order.  I asked about how they make their bellini's (type of alcohol used and if it was served frozen or on the rocks, pretty basic questions) and she did not know.  She told us she was \"kind of  new\" and didnt really know too much about the details of ingredients and such (?).  After more awkward conversations not getting anywhere, the bartender approached our table and informed me how the bellini's were made.  It is irritating when the server is not familiar with pretty basic preparation of menu items and is unable to answer the customer intelligently.  We ordered an app, the cilantro/jalapeno/edamame hummus with cucumber, pita bread, and carrots for dipping.  The hummus was completely bland and tasteless (surprisingly, because we thought it would be spicy) and the veggies for dipping were warm and soggy.  Dont order this app.  For our entrees, we ordered a steak salad and the Double D Turkey Burger.  Both were large portions.  Ended up taking half the steak salad home.  The Turkey Burger had a nice flavor.  It was still pink in the middle, but not bad enough to where I wouldve wanted to send it back and wait longer, so I just dealt with it.  The service was slow, but we didnt seem to mind too much because we were chatting away.  After our entrees, the waitress simply dropped the bill off at our table without even asking if we wanted a dessert.  After waiting for her to come back (again) we told her we wanted to order a dessert.  She returns a short while after and tells us the \"kitchen is closed and we couldnt order dessert.\"  WOW, REALLY?  NO?  It's dessert people.  It is not like the cooks are sitting back there \"cooking\" the dessert.  It was clear the waitress just didnt want to try anymore.  We asked to speak to someone else, (manager probably) who, promptly approached our table and asked us what dessert we wanted and of course we could order a dessert.  Again, it is just very irritating to be told \"no\" at a restaurant when you are the paying customer, just because the waitress was too lazy to inquire further about it or simply just to try a little harder to please the customer.  I understand it was a holiday and the restaurant was closing early and everyone working probably wanted to get out of there.  But trust me, there are plenty of other restaurants out there to chose from.  You will likely get treated better, have a wait staff that is actually familiar with menu items, and wont tell you \"no.\"",

Had the chicken nachos--which certainly was loaded with diced chicken--and felt positively stuffed afterwards.  Granted, I could have boxed up half of it and brought it home but what fun is that?  I can't say it was the best nacho dish I ever had (let's face it, it's all the sloppy sour cream and cheese that makes it sooo fattening but good)...but it WAS filling.  Very.  You get ALOT for your money here of nutritious chicken anyway...good deal!  And not all that fattening since they don't heap on sour cream and cheese but alot of healthy chicken.  Good dish for dieters. Good happy hour menu which lasts from 4-8pm with $2.75 domestic beers on the menu. Good service here, by the way.  Nice people serving a tremendous crowd with a smile no less.

However, this morning one of several dogs on the patio, this one sitting next to me, became easily agitated and began to bark aggressively at other dogs. Though the other dogs would respond in kind, their owners intervened to calm them while the owner of the instigator dog did not. This same dog was raising on hind legs to reach another customer's high bar table. When the dog placed his snout on the edge of my table, I had to ask the owner to keep him away. My complaint with Daily Dose is they did nothing to address the situation for the benefit of myself and my fellow diners. Please next time do something. I would like to come back.",

I like that the manager can always be seen going around asking tables how their meal was.  I had to send something back once and he brought it back and apologized which I appreciated.  Mimosas are good.  Coffee is great.  I go so much that I try to have something different every time, but a girl is always going to have her favorites.  I had the Hangover sandwich last Saturday.  It was delicious.  I don't know what they do to their bacon, maybe they made love to it, but whatever they do it works.   Their Veggie omelette is really good.  Their bagel & lox is something that I'd have no problems not ordering ever again, you're better off having Einstein bros.  Traditional burger is a solid good burger.  I tried their Southwest Flannel Hash recently and it's different.  I haven't quite made up my mind on it yet.  Our server said they make it from scratch, which I love, but maybe if they grilled it to be well done it'd be better. Comes out looking like a pot roast.  I might give it another try before I write it off completely, but I can always stick to their DD hash.",

She walked past tables for two and seated us next to the kitchen.  We were tired so we kept the table.  Servers walking toward the kitchen yelled orders 10 feet  before they got to the kitchen.  When was asked for water rather than coffee, our server looked crest fallen.  It took forever to get our order, 20 minutes.  We ordered basic breakfasts, nothing special.  A table was seated after we placed our order.  She got her breakfast within minutes.  We still waited.  We asked several times where our order was.  The same apology came and we were told it was on the way.  While we were waiting, we saw a server drop a napkin roll of utensils on the floor under a table.  He picked it up and put it right on the table.  Who ever uses it will be wiping their mouth with a napkin that rolled under a table where people put their dirty feet. The food was just OK, nothing special. Granted we were a little creeped out by the  dirty napkin put on the table.  The check came in the usual black holder which was covered in greasy fingerprints.",

The food comes out pretty quickly so if you're in a time crunch you don't have to worry here.  I have never had to wait for seating, and I love how they have a nice patio to also eat on when the weather is nice.   Service is hit or miss...it is usually either really great, or just the opposite (although I think I have had much more great service than bad service).  I love the gourmet coffee drinks on the menu and they even carry coconut oil to add a splash of flavor and nutrition to your coffee.   I usually order the portobello mushroom with egg whites and fruit on the side...it sounds boring but they do a great job spicing it up and it is more then enough food without the guilt of going overboard on brunch!  *Side note - they do carry gluten free bread here which is a major plus in my book! And it doesn't fall apart when you pick it up! ;)  I recommend Daily Dose for breakfast, brunch, lunch, business meetings, etc!",

    "text": "TL;DR: Rude customer service who acts friendly to you and then talks garbage behind your back when they do not know you are standing right behind them. Cannot process simple breakfast orders without correcting it multiple times and has no concern for their customers, most importantly, does not know how to handle food or food temperature correctly which is dangerous! The manager Emily who when I asked to contact the owner and if they had yelp, twitter etc, said have fun on your yelp endeavors. Thanks Emily, hope you enjoy it more than we enjoyed your sub par food and rude service.    ***   So where do I even begin with this one? First of all, we discovered this on Amazon prime now app to order and I was like, sweet, a place that delivers breakfast! Great when you are sick and in pain, a nice simple breakfast delivered helps to start the day out better, at least it should. So I ordered a few times from here for me and the hubby and usually it was ok, nothing spectacular, but it's breakfast, can't mess it up too bad? Well I was wrong there.   First the quality started going down, so I called it in personally instead of going  through the amazon app and had the hubby pick it up, spoke to a gentleman named Keegan I believe, and he assured me the order would be done right this time, awesome!   My hubby brings the order home and well it was the worse one we have had yet and I do not know how that was possible considering the guy said he personally checked   everything. I ordered a salmon bagel, should be cold, RAW salmon, cream cheese and some toppings for the bagel. This was put into a food bag with steaming hot food, so cold raw salmon becomes warm bacteria breeding ground, yum! I do not wish to get sick because they do not know how to properly handle raw fish. This is dangerous for regular people, however, having a weakened immune system to begin with, I would have a bad time. I called him back and explained everything, there was a few other issues, basic things that were overlooked and messed up, but it will be a novel if I go into that. So he said \"oh no we have a new guy back there and I should have checked better, etc\", come back and I will remake it perfectly this time! As it was a 20 minute drive each way, I said my husband will come back tomorrow instead. He said speak to the Manager named Emily and she will make it right for you guys.   I called Emily today, she sounded nice and apologetic over the phone and took the   order and said come in 15 minutes, great. My hubby was close to the area so he end up getting in a bit earlier and hears the manager with her back turned to him screaming to the back \"Make sure to bag everything separately, keep the hot food away from the cold food oh and attach an extra arm\" ( If you missed that, she was basically saying we are asking for the impossible and being so whiny that the chef should literally detach his own arm and include it ) So the chef proceeds to laugh, a few servers and herself. Then she turns around and my husband says \" We dont need the arm, thanks\", to which she changes her tune into oh tee hee, I did not mean it like that! Unsure how else she could have meant that, what I think she meant was, she did not mean for us to overhear her, but then again, she was yelling loud enough so that anyone in that general vicinity could hear. Her managerial skills were on point. When I called her about it, she seemed to not really care about what I had to say, was extremely flippant about the whole situation and just acted like a spoiled brat, rather than a restaurant manager.   I do not mind dealing with shitty customer service as people always have bad days, but being so rude that you do not bother to apologize for your stuck up behavior, and that you cannot get basic orders correct and make sure that food quality is up to par with your price, something needs to be fixed. 12.50$ for a bagel and cream cheese with about 1oz of warm salmon is not going to make up for your attitudes. If that is how they handle dealing with food issues, I do not even want to know what the quality is like in the kitchen and what on earth is being served to people as they do not have any basic understanding of food handling.",

The portions are large and the pancakes are huge so no need to order more than one. I've also tried the mimosas once and I wasn't too much of a fan of them but the coffee is great!!! They also offer complimentary coffee while you wait to be seated that's pretty good stuff.   This place is also great for large groups. There is a nice patio area with misters and a nice size dinning area. I haven't been here for lunch or dinner but there is a nice size bar with a couple of 32in TVs. So not the place to come to watch a game but that's what sports bars are for anyway. This place is know for there breakfast and there is a good reason for that just look at my pic.",

There aren't a ton of great-tasting establishments in this area, so when you find one, it really stands out. This place is one of them.  I ordered a Daily Dose Burger with Chipotle Mac & Cheese. The burger was cooked exactly as I had asked and was very flavorful. Whatever sauce they put on it is hands down the best complement to a burger I've seen or tasted. Now on to the mac & cheese: right amount of kick with a creamy/cheesy consistency that rivaled some of my favorite soul food restaurants. Our server Kylie was super attentive and always made sure our experience was the best it can be. I will definitely be coming back here for lunch again in the future.",

As we placed our order, we even commented on it being exactly the same. When the food came, they brought me the wrong salad. When we pointed out the error, the server trounced back into the kitchen and pronounced loudly enough that I could hear it across the restaurant \"she ordered a Cobb\". Several minutes later, the correct salad appeared, but no dressing on the side. When we asked for dressing, they brought it out and I started to eat the salad. About 3 bites in, I realized that they HAD put plenty of dressing on the salad so I wasn't going to be able to eat it. I ate the chicken breast off the top and that was it. Oh, and I found bacon in the salad, which I can't eat (wasn't supposed to be on the correct salad) which means they just scraped the ingredients off of the original salad and threw new toppings on. Why would I order the Cobb salad, knowing it had bacon on it if I can't eat bacon? The server came to clear the plates and asked if I wanted a box. I said no. Clearly I hadn't eaten any of the salad. She asked if something was wrong and I pointed out that it was drenched in dressing and had bacon on it, which means I couldn't eat it. She said \"oh, the dressing was supposed to be on the side\" and then she SET MY BILL IN FRONT OF ME. Are you kidding me?!? She served me food TWICE that I couldn't eat, she blamed me for one error and admitted to the other error and still thought that billing me $15 for a half a salad was a good idea? So we ask for the manager. When he originally came over, he had attitude about it as well because the server told him that I had misordered and that's why they had to remake the salad. When we explained the whole situation, he totally understood that it was the servers fault and even bagged on her for not manning up to making the mistake in the first place. He went ahead and took care of my bill, which is the only reason for the 2 star review. Bottom line-that server should be terminated. She made the mistake, she tried to blame the customer (loudly enough that every customer in the joint could hear her) and then made another mistake and didn't own up to any of it?!? Ridiculous! In the end, I won't be back. Neither will my coworkers. The manager tried to make it right, but one right doesn't fix three wrongs.",

This trite experience is emblematic of everything wrong with this place -- why over promise and under deliver ?   The chorizo Mac n cheese was reminiscent of hamburger helper and ass (donkey meat); I wanted so badly for the chicken nachos to live up to their picture and description but Managed to fall short.  The salmon eggs Benedict was uninspiring And came with two orders of mediocre potatoes.    Our waiter was adequate but acted put upon when we asked to move out of the sun and was completely unapologetic after mistakingly bringing us a large orange juice.    This place makes promises o plenty but is a Denny's in disguise.  I hope our experience is not repeated.",

    "text": "I first experienced the Daily Dose in Scottsdale so when I saw they opened a location in the Biltmore area I was super excited!  One evening my husband I were desperately looking around for a place that either delivered or we could pick up take out.  So I mentioned to my hubby about the new Daily Dose around the corner.  They closed at 9 and we literally called at 8:45 to place 2 full meals, and appetizers.  We ordered a full rack of ribs, salmon, and crab cakes as the appetizer.  The entrees came with julienned veggies and a full salad (house or caesar.)  We are not fans of julienned veggies so those were a waste.    However, the salmon was excellent.  I asked for no BBQ and just had it blackened and well-done (which I love!)  I was given a nice amount of salmon, not a small piece.  For it being the end of the night, the fish was cooked nicely and was still fresh.    My husband got a full rack of ribs and those were amazing.  The only possible complaint I might have about those is that they were a bit salty but I don't cook with salt so that might have been it.  The rib meat literally fell off the bone....so incredible!  I am so happy there is a place by us that has delectable ribs.  If you go to Daily Dose for dinner please try the ribs! They are truly delicious!   The crab cakes were quite good; there were three of them atop a bed of a corn salsa.  There were a few sauces including a creme aioli type sauce and green chile salsa.  The cakes were very yummy.   When we stopped in to get our food I asked if it was too late to order a sangria which they said it was- bummer.  But, the kind cute little bartender let me have a generous sample of the frozen sangria from their machine-deeeeeelicious!    I can't wait to go back to try more sangria and also more items from the menu.  This restaurant was a little pricey so bring some money honey! $65 was our total.",

We were in phoenix recently and we decided to try this location and oh man did we regret it. The food was still good but I can say we had the worst service we have ever had here.   We brought my nephew with us and as we were waing for our waitress go get our drink order he was sitting on my lap almost asleep. When the waitress walked up the first thing she said was \"oh look there is a baby at Myyyy table \" totally deadpan with a mean look in her eyes. What?! We just kind of laughed it off because we thought she may have been trying be funny. He was asleep the rest do the meal. She had an intense scowl on her face the entire time we interacted with her.  The waitress also never refilled our drinks or asked if we needed anything after getting our order. We had to ask other servers walking by even for our bill.  And finally, as were eating we could hear her by the bathrooms (we were in one of the booths) LOUDLY complaining that she just \"wanted to go home\" and that \"we were taking to long\" and that she \"just hoped that we would leave soon\". We only had our food for like 5 minutes at the time! We were really surprised and upset. I could understand it maybe we were being rude or something but we weren't and the place only had two other tables seated so........ I don't even know. We even still left her a tip which looking back I regret now too.   Overall, the food was good but the sevices was just so mean that we would never go back probably not even to the Scottsdale location. We were really uncomfortable and hated the entire experience. No food Is worth it.",

First time since my allergy diagnosis that I've had onion rings and the only gf bun I've not yanked off rather than eat (and boy did I eat). The service is OUTSTANDING - every time we go. The burger was really fantastic (the quality and preparation was aces). I couldn't have been more pleased. The onion rings were great, but remember I've not been able to eat onion rings in over a year, so your experience may vary. Their green iced tea is great. Our servers always go above and beyond and are more than friendly. Although the line can be long for weekend breakfast and brunch, dinner was easier to be seated, and maybe even more delicious.",

The sesame chicken skewer appetizers were tasty - just short of being a little dry when I ordered them last week. Servers have always been friendly. On 2 occasions no hostess was present and when she did appear offered no apology for making us wait. I'm sure that will be corrected so I'll be back and will refer friends.

Turkey sausage was very forgettable, the waffle was good, and the eggs were not cooked correctly for over medium. It is in kind of a weird spot a little off the beaten path, but they keep it rocking for Sunday lunch/brunch. I have been to the one in old town and had the breakfast nachos and was excited to try this location. I plan on heading back and taking another shot at something a little more daring on the menu next time. I will say this, their DD left me wishing I had the cottage cheese.",

    "text": "I am very lucky to live in the same neighborhood as this place! Without a doubt the food and service are fantastic. After reading some of the reviews I have to say that I'm sure some of the occasional staff may have off days but I highly doubt they have these issues on a regular basis or it would have happened to me. Management staff is also top notch. So are those servers from Minnesota!  Overall my favorite food items to order are the chicken nachos and any of the tacos. I also LOVE their breakfast. If you are unsure about trying out this place then definitely come for breakfast because they really do it right. The turkey sausage omelette is also my favorite but the simple bacon, eggs, and potatoes are also done extremely well for a simple breakfast dish. I am also impressed by the large selection for breakfast. Many places just have a few items and it's nice to mix it up sometimes. Other items that are great include the burgers, salmon, and ribs. One of these days I'm going to get back into the kitchen and figure out how to make that white cilantro jalapeno sauce they put on the nachos. Totally addicting! Now if I could just get one of those TV channels to be changed to Foodnetwork or HGTV I'd probably never leave.   My only request for this location is a big bike rack! We love to ride our cruisers and now is the time of year for folks to be out riding so I don't want to have to turn back if I can't lock up my cruiser.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed the BBQ chicken flatbread pizza and the accompanying salad during happy hour.  It was a perfectly portioned, tasty and healthy meal for around only $11.00.  We went to Daily Dose again tonight, and I was greatly looking forward to this favorite meal of mine.  Unfortunately, we learned tonight that this item had recently been removed from the menu!  I enjoy the service and the ambiance at this restaurant, as well as the moderate prices.  But, much as I stopped eating at California Pizza Kitchen after they eliminated my beloved roasted garlic chicken pizza there, I am not likely to eat at Daily Dose much in the future, as my most favorite dish there has been eliminated as well.  (Kudos, though, to the Sunday evening manager, whose name I didn't catch, as she graciously offered to attempt to specially prepare this item for me if I came back in on a Sunday.  I may just take her up on her offer...!)",

    "text": "I'm sorry to say that I do not agree with the other two reviews.  We stopped at this place to grab a drink and appetizer because we had some time to kill before meeting some friends, and the place looked cute as we were driving by. Service was extremely slow.  Despite all the empty tables on the patio when we came in, we were told 10-15 minutes for a table outside.  We did only wait about 5, but then we waited almost 10 minutes for our server to greet us and take our drink order.  We ordered a beer, a margarita, and chips, salsa and guacamole, and 2 waters with lemon.  5 minutes later the water comes out....without lemon.  Server says she's going to go get our drinks and I ask for lemons also.  She's off, and I take a sip of my water.  Yuck!  Worst water I've ever had at a restaurant, so five minutes later when she brings our drinks and the lemon, I don't even use it because no amount of lemon is going to get rid of the dirt taste in the water.  So now we finally have our drinks and she says our chips and salsa should be up soon.  5 minutes later we get our chips and salsa and guacamole.  What can I say....it tasted like chips, salsa and guacamole.  The whole place just felt kind of lame and depressing.  Staff didn't have much personality.  Overall we were just unimpressed.",

The waitresses regularly checks on you but not so often that you feel constantly interrupted.  This review is solely on breakfast/brunch.  There are so many dishes to choose from.  I would recommend the prime rib omelet, the crabby omelet, the egg white choices, hangover breakfast sandwich and the biscuits and gravy.  I'm a huge fan of corned beef hash but I wouldn't recommend it here.  Maybe it just doesn't suit my savory taste buds but I don't like my meat sweet.  It might be the southwestern style but I'm not a fan.",
