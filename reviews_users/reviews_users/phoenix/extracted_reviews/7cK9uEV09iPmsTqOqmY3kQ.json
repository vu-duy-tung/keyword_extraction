    "text": "First off,  we ordered our pizza in the Phoenix airport between flights. As for airport pizza this is a 7 star. I really was not existing such delicious pizza. Palatable, yes I had hoped for that thanks to use of a brick oven.   We ordered a margherita with fresh mozzarella cheese, fresh basil and tomatoes. I'm usually iffy on sliced tomatoes on pizza. But these were good.   But that's just toppings. Toppings can be good or bad. But they really don't make a pizza. The sauce and the crust are what defines a truly great pizza.   First the sauce was good. Not too sweet. Not laid on too heavy. Just the right balance to add a touch of moistness.   Now the crust. Beautifully thin. With some crispness near the edges and softer breadiness in the middle. Most importantly no part of the crust was doughy or uncooked. Which is a common problem of many pizzas -even if the average Joe isn't realizing that is a major factor of influence.   The crust even had some beautiful bubbles. Two of which were lightly charred. And that is a measure of perfection in my book. A good pizza has two lightly charred bubbles of crust. They should NOT be burnt to the point of being inedible. Just charred.   The price was $12-$13 for a small pizza. Which is a touch pricey. However, this was afterall inside the airport where a can of Coke is $3. So I'm not really going to knock them on price. And wager their normal stores fall into the average $$ range.   I'd say my biggest disappointment is that our flight started boarding or I'd have ordered a second pie. Probably try one of their meat pies.   I'd probably put La Grande Orange in the top 10 pizza pies. So now that I've said that, let me give you some background and street cred. I come from New Haven, CT arguably the pizza capitol of the world. We have three pizzarias that consistently rank in the top. Pepe's is probably ranked #1 more consistently than any other pizzaria in America. In fact in a recent scoring New Haven pizzarias placed #1, #7 and #11. NYC being the only city to have more top rated. But mind you NYC has 10x the population of little ol' New Haven.   So when I review a pizza I'm highly critical. And very few earn a 5 star rank. So good job La Grande Orange for surprising me with good pizza in Phoenix of all places (and an airport to boot). And yes I'd put this pie in my top 10 list. That is saying a lot....  Did I mention they had what looked to be fresh squeezed orange juice as well? Also, I saw a number  of reviews comment about the pizza being gluten free. If True even more kudos, and then I could proclaim La Grande Orange to be the #1 gluten free pizza pie.",

    "text": "I'll start off with the reasons why I didn't give it 4 stars.  Parking is quite limited.  You can't park on the side streets so valet is often an alternative.  Also, with the place being pretty busy, there can be a little bit of a wait for a table and you might be pretty near the adjoining table.  The pizza itself is really good.  You get to see them make it in the open kitchen so all the ingredients are fresh.  It can get hectic in the kitchen but it's cooked properly and with the right balance of meats, veggies, and sauce.  We had a margherita and it was very good due to its simplicity.  The rocket man added a few more distinct vegetables so that every bit didn't end up tasting the same when you put too many ingredients together.  Service was good and able to get drinks from next door as well.  Overall, another great pizza place in the Phoenix area!",

I went here with my best friend for a girl's dinner night, and was totally overblown with how ornate and beautiful the inside of LGO is, how delicious the food is, and how adorable the connected grocery is.  We went on a Wednesday evening and didn't even have to wait. The menu, though not very large, caters very well to every niche. My friend is gluten intolerant, and they offer a variety of gluten free salads and a gluten free pizza crust (which was completely delicious.)  Together, we split a salad and a pizza, and each had a slice or two leftover. The total came to about $12 each, which is perfect for two broke college girls who need a night out to dress up, go out, eat food and discuss life.  Bonus: After browsing all the chic items the market attached to LGO offers, try the gelato. It is so authentic, it brings back memories of my trip to Europe.",

The vibe is fantastic, lots of low key band posters around, a mini store, and a full scale pizza oven right in the dining area. If you are into pizza, then this is the holy grail, these pizzas are fanfreakingtastic. The Gladiator is easily one of my favorite pizzas ever, and the Margherita pizza is insane as well. The staff is always friendly and the restaurant is always clean. The only qualm is the mandatory valet parking in the back lot, but other than that, this place is fantastic",

I also would like to mention we came about 7pm on a Friday night and were seated immediately which I was surprised about since the place looked pretty busy. The parking lot is also a little small but we got lucky and found a good parking spot in front. Overall I would give it a 2 thumbs up!",

    "text": "I find LGO to be a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde type of place, so I will give a review with equal parts duality. In the end though, I'm going to go against the overwhelming positive grain and give it two stars for reasons below.   The Food  Mr. Hyde Says - This place seems to be two different types of restaurants. There's the breakfast/brunch servings and then there's the alternate menu, which consists of salads and their eponymous pizzas. For what it's worth, I've been here many times, more than I cared to, but my girlfriend used to live within walking distance, so it was too convenient to counter with any convincing argument against going. Of the many visits for breakfast, I've just felt underwhelmed by the food. The egg dishes, crepes, etc always leave me feeling unsatisfied and find they lack a bit of punch in the flavor department. For what it's worth, they're going for a French flare to the cuisine, but it still always seems to under deliver.   Dr. Jekyll Says - On the contrary, the non-breakfast foods are quite good. The salads and the pizzas are really good, freshly made and what you would expect from an \"artisanal\" pizza place. Additionally, they have a solid beer and wine list.   The Brick And Mortar  Mr. Hyde Says - This place, specifically during the breakfast hours, is a disaster and would make any Retail Operations manager cringe at the lack of flow before them. You line up at one station to order food and pay. You line up at another station to order coffee and pay. There's no table service. You have to order your food, all the while, scout for the random table opening, while also keeping a watchful eye out for your food to make sure you claim it before it goes cold. And, to top it off, this entire place also operates as what most people think is a really cute market, full of curios that other people call junk. Mr. Hyde believes that this market only adds to the utter chaos and lack of flow for the restaurant. It would be different if it was off to the side, but smack in the middle of everything yields chaos.   Dr. Jekyll Says - Avoid breakfast and go for dinner, where you can have great salads, pizzas and actually be seated at a table by a hostess and served by a waiter. What a revelation. The dinner area is actually in a different room and you can avoid the really cute market.  The Getting There  Mr. Hyde Says - The parking, or rather lack there of, is a huge negative. There is minimal parking on premises, minimal parking across the street, with most of the neighboring businesses posting signs, threatening to tow you.   Dr. Jekyll Says - Let's call this place what it is - a nice neighborhood restaurant that can prove \"convenient\" if you live nearby and can walk, avoiding the hassle and frustration that awaits you when you have to drive there.   Summary In the end, it's really four stars for the pizza, two for the breakfast foods, but they get dinged an extra star for the headache that is parking.   Many Phoenicians love this place. I (we) think you can do better elsewhere.   Author's Note: My girlfriend has now moved from this neighborhood, so any argument in her favor for a visit based on proximity is now moot. Mr. Hyde has cracked a menacing smile.",

I arrived here for a small lunch with some co-workers around 12:00 on a weekday - this is where I made my first mistake. The line extended out the door and there was zero parking. There was a mess of people everywhere. The line was a mess, no one knew how to order or where.   When we finally get to the front of the line there is a huge display case of tammy coe cakes, it was tempting to check them out, but we couldn't because some guy behind the counter was screaming at us to order. Seriously, and when I didn't answer immediatly I got a dirty look! Sad for them though, I probably would have ordered more had I not been rushed.   I ordered my turkey sandwich and started to search for a place to sit. We eventually found a seat in the pizza area. Then had to go back out to wait for our names to be screamed out to get our food. So classy.  My sandwich was good: the bread was good, the turkey was good, but not worth the wait and the grumpy staff.",

    "text": "Well I've always heard this place was so insanely busy, so i just never went. If it really is usually as busy as I've heard, then I recommend coming on a Saturday before the dinner rush. I came at 4:30 and was seated immediately.  It was nice to see that they had established a full bar, since I understand it was previously beer and wine only. Cocktails are pricey at $8, but they made them pretty strong, so I'm not too upset.  The Pizza was stunningly good. I ordered the gladiator and my date ordered the mushroom pizza.  The gladiator was basically a meat lovers pizza and they loaded on the toppings.  The mushroom pizza tasted so fresh, i don't think I've ever tasted mushrooms so good!  this may be the best pizza I've tasted in town, but I think I'll have to give it one more try to confirm my original thoughts.  Definite recommendation./Art",

My 1st visit, I had some of the WORST service to date. We were taken to our table, and we waited, probably a good 20 minutes until somebody came to take our drink order. Should of ordered our food at that time, because we didn't get our drinks, nor anybody to take our food order, for ANOTHER 15 minutes or so. In addition, if you get soda, you get a can, so NO FREE REFILLS.   The Caesar salad was pretty good, but came with a bit too much dressing and Parmesan cheese for my taste. The little shops next to the pizzeria was pretty cool. The ambiance of the restaurant was cool, and the pizza was good, but with horrible service, its hard to support this place.  I'll go back one more time to see if my experience improves.",

    "text": "Let's get this out of the way: La Grande Orange Pizzeria has delicious food. Their grilled wings are savory and their pizzas are incredible. They have a lot of vegan options as well.   LGO also has an adjourning gelato shop on one side and a small store on the other. The gelato is amazing, as are their selections of cakes to go with the gelato. The store has some amazing desserts for take-away as well as wines, colas, and a number of kitschy little items. People-watching there is also grade-A.   Now for the caveats. Parking is hellish, so watch out for peak restaurant hours. LGO is NOT a well-kept secret. Also, LGO is not for the enochlophobic; until seated, you will have to deal with a crowd. I have been there many times and have never seen it below nearly full capacity. The restaurant is not very big, so seating is crowded.    The service is very good considering how terribly busy it is. If you haven't been to LGO, you must go. Brave the parking, brave the crowds... you WILL be rewarded!  OR (considering how much I love to eat there) stay away at all costs! Do NOT go there!",

We ordered the Avocado Pizza, Caprese Salad and Tortilla Soup. Everything was delicious, especially the pizza crust. The lemon zest on the crust was surprisingly yummy.   The service was very friendly and accommodating. The restaurant is attached to a gelato shop and an Italian market, which you can order to go food from or select from already prepared sandwiches and other items. I didn't have a chance to check out the market, but hope to make it back very soon.",

    "text": "What is with this wait that people complain about here?  I pretty much only go on Friday and Saturday nights around 7 or 8 pm and we usually get a table within 15 minutes or sit right down at the chef's table.  The parking is a nightmare, but I since given up on trying to find a regular parking spot after they expanded to like a dozen 15 minute spots. After one of their parking dudes they pay to stand around and make wild motions at BMWs told me just to park in one after I got screwed out of two spots that opened up for me I haven't looked back.  The pizza is absolutely perfect thin crust pizza. It is amazingly consistent in particular with its crust in comparison to places like Cibo where the pizza is hit-and-miss and the center of the pizza is often soggy.  They have some fancy combinations of pizzas available, but its really just the quality of the ingredients and the consistency of cooking that make it great. My stand-by is the avocado pizza with prosciutto. You top that with their awesome Parmesan cheese, some descent wine, maybe an orange fennel salad, and a David Bowie marathon for a meal that competes well against orgasms in the battle for human stimulation.  And then there is that amazing authentic Italian gelato shop next door to top it off. Damn. I'm surprised that in a red state, Republicans don't pass a law to shut down this type of place. Or maybe just prohibit them from selling alcohol in combination with such a stimulating environment like they do at strip clubs that do the full monty.",

It's called the Padre. it's got Prosciutto, Arugula, Ricotta and fig. She ixnays the fig and subs the ricotta for bleu cheese (yes, I am shamed at being Italian and my wife not wanting ricotta on her pizza) I had a few Stella's, the by-the-glass wine menu is 2 whites and 2 reds, which blows. overall, we always love this place. We even snuck into the little grocery before we left and score some jumbo Tammie Coe cookies!!!!",

Located on a corner with more than one restaurant to choose from made parking difficult but we finally found a spot.  Pretty crowded for 5:00 on Sunday, but we only had to wait about 20 min. and went next door to check out the grocery store.  We were going to get a bottle of wine and open it with dinner but there was a $9 charge to do so, so we opted out.   Tried the ceviche as an app...being a big time ceviche fan I was not really impressed...was that an olive I tasted?  hmmm.... now to pizza.  Between 5 of us we decided to try the avacado pizza, the fallen angel and the padre (each pizza serves 2).  Although I Iove avacado's the lemon on that pizza was just a little too much for me, the fallen angel was good, with tasty fennel sausage, but the padre took the cake!  This was the only pizza that had no leftovers, the prosciuto, arugula, fig and ricotta was a combination I had never tried, but was absolutely delicious.     Too bad we were too stuffed for dessert, I would have loved to try the gelato spot next door...maybe next time.",

I come here for the pizza but their menu is amazing for flavor.  My go to pizza is a cheese with extra cheese and a fried egg on top.  Seriously, if you order pizza, any of the pizzas, ask for the fried egg on top.  There is something about the way the yolk mixes with the cheese and the perfectly savory yet sweet tomato sauce.  Some small caveats about LGO, first being table service.  On the weekends they have servers in the dining area and serve only off the dining menu.  Any other time, or if you want to order off the grocery menu, you need to order at the counter on the Grocery side.  The Grocery Side will call your name when your food is ready but all tables on the dining side are reserved for sit down eating on the weekends.  Also, parking is a pain because the main lot is meant for 25 min parking.  Complimentary valet service is available, but I hate being forced to valet when there are perfectly good spaces to park in.   A nice option for us winos, you can buy any bottle of wine on the Grocery side and enjoy it on the Dining side!  No corking fee, no $30+ for a bottle of wine (unless you want to order at $30 bottle of wine), and you can cork and take home whatever you do not finish.  Don't even get me started on the bakery case, just buy it all!",

She knew every little detail about the menu and the wine and she answered every question that we had which was quite a few. On top of that, she also seemed super genuine and actually cared about providing quality service. This definitely made our experience even better. I believe that her name is Kristin or Christine. She was awesome. Now to the wine. They have some incredible wine bottle specials. Our party of four split a $14 bottle of wine which gave each of us a pretty generous glass and it made it super cheap for us to enjoy a great glass of wine with dinner. Probably some of the best bottled wine deals you will find in Phoenix. For dinner I ordered the mushroom pizza and added an egg to that. Super delicious. Plenty of mushrooms, good amount of cheese, and the egg on top made it. My wife and the couple that we were with got their specialty pizza with the figs and prosciutto and my wife thought it was just okay. Overall, great service and delicious pizza with cheap yet good quality wine. Gotta check this place out.",

The beer at $6 pint is is not cheap but bring a growler and for $12 you can get 4 beers as long as you don't mind just one type. For wine they have an attached market with okish prices again they sell the wine with the pizza for the same price (score).  The Pizza it self, thin crust cooked in a open  fire oven. The mushroom party was the best party in my mouth or elsewhere. Sweet caramelized onions  along with a mix of mushrooms and cheese made for a real hit. The avocado pizza was unique but I found the rich avocado to be a bit overpowering for the crust.   The salads were all good that may be due to the large amount of dressing on them.

Both pizzas had a NY style thin crust but were missing the foldable greasy nature that I associate with pizza. My avocado pizza came with prosciutto which I'm not really a fan of. We also ordered a bottle of moscato wine which they were out of but the waitress recommended another French moscato which tasted more like a reisling.  Lastly for dessert I had the key lime pie. There was a thick layer of whipped cream which wasn't very sweet. The crust was some sort of nut crust which wasn't the classic graham cracker crust that I love.  Overall the meal was good but not special, seemed to be missing something. The service was friendly and attentive. Would probably not return.",

    "text": "This is my all time favorite pizza place.  Ate here years ago on a short trip through Phoenix.  I was blown away by the pizza.  SOurdough crust was amazing and the particular pizza I ate, had a balsamic vinegar reduction glaze which was incredible mixed with the pizza.  At the time, it was a sit down restaurant where you waited to be seated and now when I went back recently it was a completely different style where you order, take a number and then seat yourself.    The major problem with this place, which almost had me giving it a 4 star review, is that the parking is TERRIBLE! But: then I remembered the sea salt and caramel cookie...yep 5 stars.  Definitely a pizza place worth going out of the way for.  We were back recently in the Phoenix area and drove for miles just to get back here.  So happy we did.",

I've enjoyed it on over 5 separate occasions, and each time is just as mouth/water/ingly delicious as than the last. Seriously, it means everything to me.   The vibe at LGO adds to the taste as well, though getting takeout goes swimmingly every time. Last time I was there, my favorite song by one of my favorite bands played in the relaxing, warm environment.   My only concern is that it is a little loud what with small children chattering and what not. I don't mind however. Just as long as I get my Fallen Angel Pizza forever. Always.   Tl; dr: The Fallen Angel pizza makes me question my faith in the most beautiful and tasty way.",

While I waited, I ordered a Dark 'n Stormy, which was made with Gosling's rum and ginger beer and was very satisfying. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-pizzeria-phoenix?select=3I1MDsYqvtcSvZ1mEAdm3A#3I1MDsYqvtcSvZ1mEAdm3A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/la-g...</a>  I recall having to nurse it, when what I really wanted to do was order another one.  We eventually ordered a pizza to share, the Fallen Angel, which consisted of local Schreiner's sausage, roasted yellow peppers, shaved fennel, and \"premium cheese and red sauce.\" <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-pizzeria-phoenix?select=mnnAJU87MV0Skbk9d5xPVA#mnnAJU87MV0Skbk9d5xPVA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/la-g...</a>  Very, very good!

    "text": "Summary: food okay, service appalling.   Went for a quick bite at 8:30 on a Saturday evening. Place was at half capacity. Waited, according to sign, for the Maitre D' to seat the party; after a couple of minutes and no Maitre D' anywhere to be seen and under the careless looks of the waitresses passing by, seated ourselves at the long table across from the kitchen.   Server approached and took the drinks order and the food order simultaneously, as we stated that we were really hungry, then came back with the drinks and disappeared. We waited patiently for the pizzas to bake. In the meantime, the, what we learned later, Maitre D entered the scene. It had been 10 minutes since we had set foot at the restaurant. No eye contact nor any acknowledgement of our presence. Didn't seem to care at all, as she would have probably noticed that there were four people sitting at the table with four napkins and no silverware. There was a bunch of knives at her station, along with what looked like a giant slab of Parmesan, just left there unattended on top of some napkins, well within my reach. I could have taken it and rubbed it all over my head, if I wanted to. Nobody would have noticed.   So after a short while finally the Maitre D' appeared, not with the silverware, but with the ready pizzas. We asked for silverware, as we were very hungry and wanted to eat. Right. Away. She asked if we wanted some Parmesan on the pizza. We said yes on the one and no on the other, but, above all, could we get some silverware, as we are, after all, civilized people. She grabbed the slab of Parmesan from above my head and started grating it over the pizza, obviously not being able to process the concept of silverware. I did not want to intimidate her, because I remembered the knives at her station, and she looked angry that someone was interfering with her critical act of grating cheese.   Finally our waitress appeared again and we begged for some silverware. She went somewhere and came back with two forks and one knife on a plate and threw them on the table. Two forks and one knife  For four people. We started losing hope. I was only glad we ordered pizzas and not a salad. Salad is really difficult to eat with hands only. Finally at the fourth attempt, all was corrected, there were forks and knives for everyone, and joy and peace and pizza. Pizza was totally okay, but, again, it's pizza. My friends, who have been going to this place for 10+ years love it, though, and drove 30 miles to go there.   At some point a young man by the name of Henry Hanson, Manager, approached the table and asked if everything was okay. All of us said yes, we had just needed some forks and knives but now all was peachy. He left, only to come back in 10 minutes. Obviously he was bored or sad or lonely and needed to talk to someone. I actually wanted to eat pizza and was not really ready to make new friends. He again asked what happened and stated that his staff was feeling insulted by our demand to have knives and forks, suggested we would apologize. Well I refuse to apologize for not wanting to eat, what is being marketed as gourmet pizza, with my fingers and explained the basic concept of service business - when you satisfy your reasonable customer's needs properly, nobody would feel insulted. In fact, I felt insulted by Mr. Hanson, Manager, that I would have to accept to eat like a wild man, only to protect his staff's feelings.   We finished, paid, tipped 18% and left the restaurant. We were followed in the parking lot by Mr. Hanson, Manager, and asked not to come back to this restaurant, because of our interaction with the staff. Or else he'd put up a big beautiful wall around it. Ok, he didn't really say the last part.   Actually we would have never even thought of going back there, at least as long as this place employs inadequately trained service staff, who obviously have serious deficits in common sense and no clue of fundamental customer service principles.   So my advise to any future patrons:  One: bring your own silverware  Two: don't demand anything from the staff. In fact, just reach out for that Parmesan, it's been sitting there in the open for hours. Just nibble on it, you'll be fine.  Three: don't talk, laugh, breathe, move, or do anything that might insult the staff. They are very emotional human beings and are not there to cater to any of your needs, quite the contrary, you are there to cater to their emotional needs and pay them for that.  Four: actually try not to go there at all. Everyone will be happy!",

It was very good:  thin crust, crust was tasty, cheese was so flavorful, the sausage was full of flavors too, and there was pepperoni hiding between the crust and the cheese.  The cheese pizza was great too.  My mouth and tummy was a happy camper.    Why 4 stars?  The service.  It was slow, had to ask for refills, and just painfully to get your server's attention.

    "text": "The buzz on the street is their pizza will blow your stinky socks off your feet! Well, not exactly in those words, but in that promising context!  If you know me like the back of your hand, you would already know what I look for! The crust! For one, I am a carboholic!  Whether that be bread, donuts, or rice, I cherish that food group immensely.  I firmly believe the most critical bite in a pizza is going to be your first one! It will make or break your love for it! Why? Because its the closest you will get to freshness since the time it popped out of the oven!   Bam! Love at first bite! Just the sight and smell caused some drool-age!  It had the right amount of crispness and thinness.  The bottom crust had a slight charcoal, the way one should always like it! And the middle layer still soft enough for some bending and flexibility!  Crust Test: Pass.   During my most recent visit, the amigos and I decided on the \"Gladiator.\" Yup! I guess it was indeed the most manly pizza you could get here. Glorious meat! The schreiner's sausage and pepperoni were cooked very nicely!  The cheese and sauce were no match for the meat! They played more of a subtle role but still contributed to a wonderful pizza experience.  Sauce and Toppings Test: Pass.  With all that said, I want to clearly say, this is not what I call a True Italian pizza.  As great as it was its hard for me to put it on the same level as some well-known places like Pizzeria Bianco, which will always be my numero uno.  The major difference is in the sourdough crust.  To me, this is what defined their pizza. The one trait that separates them from the Italian style is how it is NOT bubbly with that brick-oven charcoal quality.  Instead, its more simple yet quite tasty.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ?select=Q0kUcPJhdZlueuitX154VQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/7cK9...</a>  Besides everything said thus far, I want to give credit to their excellent service.  The host did a good job in booking our table and notifying my group when our time was near. Our server maintained a playful, enthusiastic attitude from the moment we sat to the time we finished our last dessert bite!   Speaking of dessert, I happily decided that their Red Velvet Cake be my new go-to! The frosting and cake was not too sweet, just to my liking!   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7cK9uEV09iPmsTqOqmY3kQ?select=bCRxfhgIbOSC-eRUgD3M_g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/7cK9...</a>  The moral of the story, do not come here if you are seeking a True Italian experience.  Do come here, if you desire a wonderfully tasting pizza in a friendly, cool, upbeat atmosphere!",

The grocery shop next door is very pleasant as well... Lots of cute items and yummy desserts. Aside from Phoenix, AZ apparently there are other LGO locations in Santa Monica and Pasadena... Wish there was one in NorCal. In summary, this place is fantastic!  The only con: this place is always busy... However, the wait is so worth it!",

The pizza is still good, I like the thin crust and the inventive toppings. They just haven't been quite as good as they used to be. The caprese salad isn't that special one that I had the first time either....sigh. You know what still is delicious? That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good. I don't love the forced valet parking....why can't we just park? aaanyway, I would not say that LGO is the best pizza in Phoenix, but it is still a solid choice.",

After always seeing great reviews on my Yelp home page I decided that i had to go and give it a shot!  None of us in our group had been there before so we had no idea what to expect. We all had a fantastic time at LGO! When we showed up we had to wait 20 minutes so we went next door to the grocery store, the time flew by while we where over there. With all the things to look at, it was the fastest 20 minutes of my life.  Our food was beyond delicious and our service was great! I cannot say anything bad! If you haven't been before you gotta go! I will defiantly be back",

My bf and I shared the avocado prosciutto pizza which was amazing!  I love thin crust pizzas like that.  The rest of the menu looked really good too, like the roasted corn pizza and the mushroom pizza.  Will have to come back to try those ones!  We also had the shrimp ceviche, which was more like salsa.  Not anything like a ceviche you would get in South America, but still good!",

Salads are fabulous too and the sangria is delicious and fresh.  The grocery next door has amazing baked goods, salads and cheeses to go.  A great place to put a picnic together, or eat at the patio tables in front.  Wonderful wine selection and unusual cards and gifts if you're in need of a hostess present or just enjoy shopping.  Overall, a wonderful place to be from breakfast to dinner, centrally located between Scottsdale and Phoenix.",

Customers place orders at a counter on one side of the house (a store-like setting jamb-packed with various pricey food and gift items). Pizza-man then shouts your name over the crowd when your order is ready. It's open seating in the dining hall, and it appears one needs to ask for the tables to be bussed if they aren't clean when you sit down. There was one busser that was being kept far too busy this Sunday afternoon.  For what they're charging you can get about equal quality at a place like NYPD Pizza and experience actual table service. What you won't get is the opportunity to spend $38 on a ultra-special insulated sports bottle with the LGO logo on it. It's the perfect way to tell everyone in Arcadia that you have $38 to spend on a sports bottle.  Thirty-Eight dollars.  . .",

My husband and son shared a gluten free one with sausage and pepperoni.  They loved it.  The gluten free crust was more of a cracker than a crust- super thin and crunchy.  The sausage looked delicious.  Big chunks.  My girls and I shared a cheese pizza with goat cheese and roasted garlic.  It was really good but I kept thinking it was missing something.  Would have loved roasted pine nuts on it.  That is not an option on the menu.  I was not a fan of the gelato place connected.  I thought the portion sizes were really small for a gelato place and it was pricey for what you got.",

Among my favorites: both tuna sandwiches, french pancakes, tuna Nicoise salad, cottage cheese, fresh juices, and roasted corn pizza. Oh and sometimes their music taste is so good you'll discover a new song you want to add to your playlist.

You know that it is going to be a bit of a challenge to get together with him/her, and they might give you a hard time? But once you do get settled in, all is well and your friend is awesome?   So that's where I am with LGO. I have been coming here for 4 years or so, and the parking always sucks (as previously mentioned) and the lines are always long (also previously mentioned). I suppose its impressive that this place is so packed all the time....but based on the food, it's not surprising.  The food is awesome- particularly the pizzas and the commuter sandwich. Also they have some of the best prepackaged salads I have ever had....I'm not even a salad girl! Overall, LGO is a place with character, entertainment, and great food.   One more thing is the size- during the lunch/dinner rush it is particularly difficult for those in wheelchairs to manuever the room. Last year I scheduled a meeting with several colleagues, and one who was in a wheelchair had a very hard time- we had to ask another group to switch with us so she could get up to the table. I'm quite certain it was pretty embarassing for her.",

It is a spin on the standard margherita adding a splash of a freshly squeezed lemon and then topped off with a fresh sliced avocado. For the record, LGO buys the best avocados I've tasted.   Another tip buy your bottle of wine in the attached grocery side of LGO for no cork fee and prices aren't bad for bottled wine.   Great casual upscale dining atmosphere. Jeans, t-shirt, and great food.",

The wait was 40 minutes so we decided to go have a drink at LGO while we waited.  We sat at the Chefs table and were greeted by our server Emma, I must say Emma was the nicest server. We asked her a ton of questions about what her favorite dishes were for when we come back. She was so helpful.  We ordered a bottle of wine, its a much better deal than a glass. They sell wine in their shop next door. You buy the bottle at retail price and there is no corking fee. We got a bottle for $13!! You cannot beat that.  After chatting with Emma for a while and seeing the food around us we ended up taking our name off the list at Postino. (we still love you Postino the wait was just too long).  Emma recommended the Padres pizza which is not on the menu. It was delicious. No sauce, four cheese blend, prosciutto, and fig! The salty/ sweet combo is great!!  We started with the Shrimp Ceviche and it was the best I have had!! The shrimp was plump and not sparse in the dish.  LGO had a warm, cozy environment that is inviting. Emma was fantastic! The food was yuuummyy!! We cant wait to go back and try a different kind of pie!",

I wish this place was a little closer because I would be here all the time.  It was neat too, because I also saw Ryan Sandburg (chicago cubbies legend) eating here.

It has a mini, super fancy grocery store where you can get great wine deals and adorable trinkets and gifts. They serve breakfast all day, so I definitely recommend the Croque Madame. It's hands down my favorite breakfast. If you're feeling lunch-y, you can head over to the LGO pizzaria and try the Gladiator, which has delicious sausage from Schreiner's Sausage (the best in Phoenix). It has a great patio, which is perfect this time of year. It draws a regular crowd, so you usually end up making friends with the other customers. I highly recommend this restaurant (especially for some hearty food after a hike on Camelback mountain).",

Craig is a great waiter and remembers all of our ordering quirks including the need for extra Splenda to go with our iced tea.  It's always a hoot to check out his new 'do for the week.  For appetizers, the BF loves to order a half dozen of their Chicken Wings ($7).  The wings are moist with a nice bit of char on them and a zesty wing sauce.  The housemade Point Reyes blue cheese dressing is a nice counterpoint to the slightly spicy wings.  I frequently order the Chopped Turkey salad ($8.25) with fresh greens, tomatoes, egg, avocado, bacon, Point Reyes blue cheese and cheddar tossed with both ranch and house vinaigrette.  This salad is technically only available at the LGO Grocery next door, but they will serve you one at the pizzeria if they have one on hand.  I have them dress the salad as usual with a combo of ranch and house vinaigrette, but then I get a side of the Point Reye blue cheese dressing as it's a tasty dip for the turkey and tomatoes.  Sometimes we go for the Shrimp Ceviche ($13) with avocado, tomatoes, jicama and lime juice with house-made tortilla chips.  If we're in the mood for pizza, we order the Gladiator ($14) with Schreiner's sausage and pepperoni, cheese blend and house-made red sauce.  We kick it up a notch and add black olives, broccolini, bacon and lemon zest.  Once in a while we go for broke and have them add a cracked egg to the mix.  I prefer a crisp crust, so I order the pizza \"well done\" to the point where the crust is almost burnt.  It's delicious and a decent stand-in for the ethereal pies at Pizzeria Bianco given that it does not require a wait of three or four hours.  Sometimes we mix it up and order the Fish Sandwich ($14) with house-made slaw.  It's best with fresh halibut.  I order a side of the Russian dressing to oomph up the sandwich.  And the fries they serve along with the sandwich are excellent.  We never order dessert here because we always grab it from the utterly superb Arlecchino Gelateria next door and bring it back to the table to enjoy.  The decor is pleasant with a huge vase in the center of the room that acts as an economic barometer.  The fresh flowers in the vase reach all the way to the ceiling when times are good and the arrangement gets shorter and shorter the worse the economy gets.  All in all, LGO Pizzeria is a great neighborhood yuppie pizza joint.",

Made me pucker but I couldn't stop drinking them! So pulpy and totally awesome. The white pizza was superb, maybe even better than Cibo (downtown Phoenix)... Yeah, this pizza was the best. The ambiance was relaxed but intimate with dim lighting, candle lit tables, and good service. I'll definitely be going back for this perfect combo :)",

    "text": "I must say I have drove by this place numerous times but have always been a little deterred to go in.  I wasn't quite sure what to expect since the parking was so small, the signs of where the actual restaurant was, wasn't that clear to me but after talking with a friend I was convinced I had to try this place. The parking was a bit confusing the lot in front is only for the market so if you are planning on dining in you can't park there. They share the valet services with Postino's which is directly behind their building (They will validate the ticket so valet is free). Walking up to the building I entered through what I am pretty sure was the La Grande Orange Market then through a skinny walkway entered the actual Pizzeria which was much bigger than I had expected. Our waiter was very friendly, he made sure we were aware of the specials and answered any questions we had. I ordered the Classic Margherita Pizza which was made with their signature sourdough crust that was so tasty, the fresh mozzarella and tomatoes gave it such great flavor. My friend ordered the Mother Earth Pizza that was full of fresh vegetables and just the right amount of cheese. For dessert we had the LGO old timer it looked like a giant homemade ding dong and while it was very rich, it was oh so yummy.... Overall I will definitely be back I loved the people, the food and the charm!!!",

The different pizzas have such fresh and flavorful ingredients and they top it off with freshly grated Parmesan! For our dinner we started with the guacamole & pimento cheese and chips platter. It was absolutely shocking of freakin' good it was. I don't even like pimento Cheese (not in the least) and there I was scarfing it down like no other. The guacamole was mad fresh too! We ordered the rocket man pizza and the Mother Earth--both phenomenal choices. All in all it was an beautifully delicious meal and would totally come back!",

    "text": "I have always been a huge fan of LGO. I was lucky enough years ago to live just down the street and spent many Saturdays biking up for coffee and breakfast. I have missed being in my \"hood\" since the day we left (and all the great places that came with it!) so when we did a staycation at the Phoenician Resort this past weekend, there was no doubt my meals would be from LGO! Saturday morning I visited the store to check out all their awesome trinkets, wine, cheeses, beer selection and ordered my fav breakfast sandwich, The Commuter. I also picked up salads for lunch, some treats for my son, and a few cans of Riesling Radler (yum!). I got there about 8:30 and there was plenty of parking still and it was not too busy. As people as mentioned, it can get really, really busy, with parking being a bit tough if you just want to run in and grab something, but they do offer valet parking in the rear, and I always encourage those that are going to be there awhile, to use the valet parking and save the front spots for patrons who just want to be in and out. Breakfast and lunch did not disappoint, and for dinner we called in a curbside pickup for a few pizzas. My favorite pizza was always the roasted corn and goat cheese, which they took off the menu (why?!!) but you can still order it (yay!). We had a small miscommunication about wanting some blue cheese dressing on the side (they put it on the pizza) but they made it right in no time, were super apologetic (mistakes happen, no biggie!) and it was SO GOOD! We were back again Sunday morning for two more commuters and a couple of coffees. I rarely eat at the same spot two days in a row, let alone 5 meals in a row, but it was so worth it and so good! I love their ready made section and need to remember to pop down now and then and pick up some salads for the week. Great service, great food and as I was discussing with friends this weekend, I love that they have not gone mainstream like so many other great spots in the Valley and they remain with just their sole location (well, I think they opened they small shop in the airport, but that doesn't count IMO). However, if you would consider maybe a shop in the 7th Street/Bell corridor, I would be forever grateful!   My only gripe is again to patrons, STOP parking in the curbside spots!! I know people are rude and ignorant, but those spots are designated for curbside for a reason, don't be that person who takes them just because you think you are going to be in and out and it doesn't really matter - it does matter.",

That is crazy talk... I've only been frequenting this pizzeria at least once a month for the last ten or so years ;)  Whether you dine in or take out, this place is great.  I'm going with five fabulous stars for this one, and here are my top five reasons why:  1 - consistency... I've never had a bad meal at LGO Pizzeria 2 - service... friendly and attentive when you dine in and who doesn't love the option for curbside pick-up when taking out?! 3 - kid-friendly.  even for two picky toddlers that don't usually sit still.  My kids love LGO pizza! 4 - vibe.  there is always an awesome energy at this place and great music too! 5 - comfortable and casual - no need to dress to impress here... come in your sweats or workout clothes or dress up if you please.  you'll be comfortable no matter what; especially if you score a booth seat!  So there you have it.  If you're in the mood for pizza, salad, or even wings, a burger, a glass (or bottle) of wine, or some amazing baked goods or gelato,  you can't go wrong with this place!  Make sure to visit the grocery / retail shop nextdoor when you go as well :)",

There have simply been too many misfires from them for me to keep trying.   Here is our conversation:  Hello Esteban, thanks for reaching out. We appreciate when our loyal fans point out something they think is below our standard. Be assured, we are very concerned about undercooked chicken. We bake the wings for two hours and always use thermometers to verify the temperature is correct before we grill them to order. Often with the high-quality chicken we use, the meat is quite pink near the bone. However, we've clearly proven we're human and have made our share of mistakes. Our culinary team is looking into the inconsistencies you described. We'd like to invite you back in to let us know how we're doing, can you send me your email so we can send you an Ecomp for a future visit? Thanks again and hope to hear from you soon.  Regards,  Hillary Owen Compliance Manager LGO Hospitality //  Hi Hillary.  I'm done.  I just ate the most god-awful Rueben sandwich ever in my life.  My daughter brought it home for me for lunch.  The pastrami is black.  No, not just the rind, all of it.  Tastes like it's been around for a while.  Same for the cole slaw.  The pineapple slice garnish that came with it doesn't even taste like pineapple.  It's hugely disappointing to me that your quality has dropped so substantially.  Thanks for the offer of a freebie, but I'm not interested, I just want the quality food you once provided.  I'm guessing that is not going to happen.",

    "text": "La Grande Orange serves the best pizza in Phoenix.  Driving by La Grande Orange (LGO), the only distinguishing feature on the facade of the building is its orange color. If you were tempted to stop inside you would probably stick to the self-described \"funky retail grocery\" half of the store that sells quirky cards, artisan wines, and sumptuous baked goods like cheesecakes, dark chocolate brownies, and generously sized cookies displayed in spotless glass cases. The real treat however, is located in the adjoining pizzeria, where executive chef Shay Gau has mastered the art of simple, yet extraordinarily flavorful pizzas, salads, and grilled entrees.  The golden-hued, twelve inch, sizzling pizzas are a feast for the eyes, and a banquet for the taste buds. Airy, yet chewy, the sourdough crust is tender, but with a crunch at the ends. Perfect pairings at LGO include The Gladiator, topped generously with Schreiner's Italian sausage and crispy pepperoni and The Classic Margherita, suiting vegetarians with mozzarella, roasted tomato and fresh, fragrant basil topping its premium red sauce. Another fan favorite is the Fallen Angel pizza, which features crunchy, slightly-sweet and refreshing shaved fennel, roasted peppers, and succulent sun dried tomatoes over Schreiner's Italian sausage.   LGO may offer a simple menu of appetizers, pizza, salads, and burgers, but that doesn't make decision making easy. The star of the appetizers is the LGO Chips and Dips Plate. House-made guacamole, salsa, and pimento dip lined up on a rectangular platter accompany crispy tortilla chips sturdy enough for sampling all the tasty dipping options.  And for dessert?  Chef Shay Gau excels there, too. Along with the already-mentioned glorious baked goods, LGO offers rich gelato and beautifully hand made cakes from their bake shop, boasting all natural ingredients with no preservatives or chemical additives.   The atmosphere is casual and if you go on a busy night, very lively. The packed parking lot on Friday night is a positive reminder of why patrons flock to this favorite neighborhood pizzeria. The warm wood tones of the high tables and booths help cultivate a snug, comfortable dining atmosphere.    Pulling the focus to the center of the room, a towering, grandiose flower arrangement stands with a flurry of yellow, green and red color.  With an open floor design, patrons see the busy chefs at work, adding to the inclusive atmosphere, where the staff is efficient, friendly, and polite.",

We ordered at the counter and ate in the dining room; a very sweet waitress took care of our drinks and expedited the food.

    "text": "La Grande Orange is incredibly popular amongst the locals - and deservedly so. I rank their food right up there with some of the best we have.  Unlike most places these days that use the ever-so-popular brick/wood-fired approach, LGO opts to bake their pies in the more traditional pizza oven. Their ingredients are high quality and their sourdough crust is a lovely touch.  Oddly enough, my favorite creation isn't even on the menu anymore, but can still be ordered on request. The roasted corn and traditional margherita are also some of my favorites. They seem to cater more towards the vegetarian/garden pizza style here, which can be somewhat subjective based on your personal tastes.  It's not all about pizza at LGO. Although I would never expect it, their cheeseburger is easily one of the best that I've found in my search, exceeding even the LGO Ingo offerings that can be found next door. Request to have it served on one of their English muffins and you won't regret it. Lots of ingredients, including some shredded cheese, which works much better than you would assume. Their chips and dip also ended up being a big surprise and has now become an essential \"starter\" every time we visit. The pimento and guacamole are top notch stuff.  Desserts are kind of hit and miss. I'm not a big fan of their red velvet or the old timer, which seems much too hard-textured to match the classic Hostess cupcake it's obviously attempting to improve upon. It's their sea salt cookie, topped with a scoop of gelato that has become the default request whenever we visit. Note that their bakery also serves a variety of other items as well, including various knick-knacks that seem to mostly be gift-related items.  Service can be iffy. We always seem to get stuck with one of those tiny tables up front, which is rarely able to accommodate the amount of food that we order. Servers vary. We've had some that are decent, while others rarely check up on us to see if we need anything else.  The place can get loud at times, although it seems they've improved upon this issue as of late. Overall, it's a great dining experience. A nice atmosphere with a mixture of customers that isn't overkill on the hipster vibe.  After numerous repeat visits and hit or miss service, I can't quite give it a full five stars, but it's still one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  Highly recommended!",

    "text": "As far a pizza goes I have to say that LGO's pizza is just okay. I love, love, and I mean love pizza. I would eat it every day. Cold for breakfast even.   But the pies I have had here definitely left something to be desired. I love the toppings and the interesting flavours but I am sill waiting for that wow factor that makes me want to have this pizza again and again. (** I do love that they will halve the specialty pizzas for you with no qualm. You can try two pies in one visit.)  There are a few pies on my \"need to try that\" list. So I will be back. Plus I really want to try the burgers and the wings. I'd say at the least two more trips in the near future, of my own will. Maybe more if someone else chooses to invite.   I love the chandelier in the dining area and the TV over the long bar. This place has a nice rustic feel in with the concrete bar top and the rich dark wood tables. A few larger tables for a bigger party but most of the tables seat four. Or two if you're by the window.   If you do not like crowds or tight spots this is not the place for you. You order your pizza on the grocery side and there are always a ton of people in this itty bitty space. The menus are near the register when they should be near the doors. But there is usually a kind staff member to ask if you need one.   All in all... It is something I say you should try once. Especially if you love toying new places and love you some pizzas.",

LGO has a variety of colorful pizzas that have your traditional cheese to more exotic things like avocado. I have never though about putting avocado on a pizza...I bet it's really good. What also makes LGO really cool is that they offer vegan and gluten free pizza crusts. Just be careful though, because their vegan crust is not gluten free and their gluten free crust is not vegan. They also offer an array of delicious salads.   I have the pizzeria chopped salad without cheese and I added avocado to it. The salad has lettuce, pistachios, raisins, artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes, and olives. It's tossed in a champagne vinaigrette. It was pretty tasty and was the perfect portion for one person.   My date ordered a pepperoni and cheese pizza on a gluten free crust. It looked and smelled delicious. Because I'm a vegetarian, I did not taste it. He said it was really good, however. I have had their pizzas before and they are indeed delicious.   The only problem with my experience is that my salad came out a good 15 minutes before his pizza. I did the polite Italian thing and waited for his pizza to come out before I ate my salad. It's a good thing because I would have finished my salad way before he finished his pizza. I should have eaten my salad, paid my bill and ditched the douche...but politeness prevailed in this case. Oh well.",

It's one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix too, but I have to say, the pizza is more like 3 stars. It is good, but not great. Just not a big fan of their crust. Now, the burgers, decor, service and people watching are all awesome. Plus it is attached to the LGO grocery store which is great.  Last night I had their green chili burger for the first time and thought it was great. The beef was delicious and cooked to order, the roasted green chili tasted great, and even though it is borderline sacrilege, when at LGO, you gotta go with one of their massive English Muffins instead of a bun. I think it could be even better with melted American cheese, but the shredded cheddar is a nice alternative to the slice. The side of fries were awesome and they give you more than enough.  After dinner I suggest you go over to the grocery store area and try one of the delectable desserts. I'm a fan of the Tammie Coe Ooey Gooey cupcakes myself. Parking's a bitch, but you can understand why. It's a great place. Check 'em out. You'll probably like it a lot.",

That being said, last night was extra awesome for us.   We sat in the lounge area because the dining room looked pretty busy and we're not picky. The bartender seemed a little new, but that never bothers us. We've both been in the service industry and are understanding. We ordered our usual, the margherita pizza with prosciutto and goat cheese (along with the tom, basil and motzz that's already on it). SO GOOD.   Our pizza was delivered with NO cheese! Which is pretty funny. The server thought I said no cheese instead of goat cheese. COMPLETELY understandable! We both laughed and we're totally fine waiting for them to remake it.   The manager, Chris, came over and offered the most sincere apology and also shared a laugh about the misunderstanding. He also took the pizza off of our bill. We didn't think this was necessary, but it was greatly appreciated. The service and hospitality were above exceptional and this is why a restaurant like LGO not only becomes popular but endures the timeframe in which most bright restaurants fizzle.   Again, we've both worked in the service industry and understand mistakes. We are loyal to a few restaurants in Phoenix because of the way those mistakes are handled. The manager Chris, our server (I didn't catch his name) and La Grande Orange in general are the epitome of great service and management.    See ya'll again soon!   ps. we finally tried the peanut butter pie and my boyfriends words were \"I've literally never had a better dessert in my entire life.\"",

We went at lunchtime during the week and it was horribly crowded, they play their music SUPER loud on both the dining area and the shop area where you order your food. It's confusing to then get your order, and you have no place to stand  or wait.  If you order a salad it's in a pre-made to-go box, but made fresh. There is almost no parking so you have to drive your car around to the back to use the (free) valet. I think it's more of a pretentious place to go to say you've been there because it's in an up and coming neighborhood, but nothing about it would make me go back there over any other similar  restaurant.",

Our server couldn't get it together, not once did she come back to fill the water glasses, bring replacement silverware or for that matter even take the order. We caught her outside chatting with her chronies and washing windows behind the teapot while we were her only table. She wasfast with the check lol. 5 star food 1 star service",

However, they say the pizza feeds 1-2 people. It doesn't. It is a single person pizza. Don't get fooled. If you are 2 people, get 2 pizzas. You might have a very small amount to take home, but it's better Han going hungry. I tried for the first time the hamburger tonight - good, but their sister restaurant across the street is better for burgers. Stick with the pizza, it's what makes LGO famous.",

Service was warm and friendly - but not intrusive..atmosphere was lively, perhaps even a bit loud..but I wasn't there for a romantic dinner - just for great food. I did a half and half on the pizza with the waiters suggestion....the avocado pizza with prosciutto was to die for! Nice glass of white sangria and a an oh so yummy piece of red velvet cake for desert. I could not help but wander around and have a scoop of gelato next door and then browse through the grocery/bakery in this complex while I was there. A wonderful spot for a casual evening out. The only drawback is the parking, but they do have a $3 valet that will handle that discomfort for you.",

Their pizza was among the best I've ever had - anywhere.  That includes NY or Chicago.  The bread tastes fresh and they use real mozzarella.  It's light, crispy, just juicy enough, and a litle bit oily.  And the rest of the brunch options I sampled - like the english muffin sandwich and cappuccino were good too.   But stay away from the salads.  I had a thai chicken salad and it wasn't fresh but came out of a refrigerator.  The sauce had a funky funky sesame smell,  I smelled it, took two bites, and trashed it.   Overall, the place had a positive cheerful vibe which seemed more california or colorado than arizona.  And while there were a lot of posers there for sure - it wasn't too bad.  I'll add it to in and out burger as a go to place when stuck in PHX.",

I have honestly had better sangria at Olive Garden. However the second time I stayed away from the sangria and had wine which is always great!  The food was delicious and the staff was wonderful. They were very nice the first time I went as well. Perhaps I was not  in the right frame the first time but I will go back again based on my second experience. I orderd the cheese pizza and had the peanut butter pie from the grocery next door. The peanut butter pie is enough to give this place 5 stars! However the pizza was delicious and I hated to share it with my friends! Just goes to prove that you should always give a place a second chance!",

My friend always talked about this place, but we would always vie for Oreganos, Sauce, Grimaldi's, Nello's or somewhere else! I'm giving it three stars for a few reasons.  We just ordered a pepperoni pizza. Pretty simple. I didn't like how you got a Solo cup with ice, and you got to pick a can of soda. Personally, I don't drink coke out of a can and I only like it by fountain, so I thought the whole grab a can and pour it in a cup thing was weird. Plus, no refills, which is lame considering the cup is a kids size small. The pizza was good, but way too expensive for just one pizza. Also, the parking lot is way, way too small for a popular place like this. What I did like was the atmosphere, the pizza was fine, and setup is nice. I like the TVs as well.",

It was between LGO and Mama Mia's Brick oven pizza. Glad I chose LGO. Service was quick and the decor was very clean and a smidge upscale from casual. I got the Mushroom Party and my co-worker got the classic cheese so we could split pizzas. The sourdough crust is phenomenal and the pizza's were not greasy (save for the cheese, but not bad). I'm no pizza connoisseur but I've eaten out a lot and hands down, this is the best, freshest tasting pizza I've ever eaten. We had the chips and salsa that also came with a avocado and pimento type of dip. Portions are just the right size and with my Stella Artois on tap, my meal was very enjoyable and satisfying. I found out from the waiter that there are two LGO's in SoCal. One in Pasadena and another in Santa Monica. Both are within driving distance from me and I now plan on soon visiting.",

    "text": "Cluster***** Here's the scoop - I really like LGO's food, but the concept can be incredibly frustrating for a few reasons listed below.   - Parking is insane. Yes, they added valet, but it's usually five cars deep to pull off. Also, even if you want to temporarily park in one of their To Go parking spots, it's congested to the point where I've driven away out of annoyance. Not a good sign, when your customers who actually really want to eat there will drive away out of frustration.   - The line to order. Seriously guys, can't you just have table service!? To be fair, they DO have full service in the restaurant during dinner, but for lunch and breakfast (when they are generally most busy) you have to wait in line between tables and shelves overflowing with expensive knickknacks just to order your meal.   - Now after your order, you have to wait around AGAIN to pick up your food at a separate area, shoved in the corner where there are constant staff members leaving and entering the kitchen, the coffee bar, and more shelves filled with trinkets all smashed together with hungry customers waiting for their food. Ugh. Hate to sound like I'm just complaining here, but TRUST ME, it's obnoxious.   If you do visit, go for dinner service only, where you can enjoy your meal as a server will wait on you.   Now on the bright side, their chocolate walnut cookie and chocolate pudding is to die for. Also, I love the avocado pizza - Be sure to add prosciutto.",

    "text": "It looks like they've made some changes!  The parking lot has a sign at the side saying exit only to encourage one way traffic through the tight lot.  They have some spots blocked off out front for basically a \"drive-in\" type of scenario where you sit there until someone comes to take your order, etc.  The line is a lot faster now since everyone at any of the counter spots are ready and willing to take your order.  Couple things though, the sign also says exit only do not enter facing the other way (into the lot) which may cause some people to take it the wrong way.  The spots out front - at least half should be pick up and go spots where you can just park for a few minutes to get your food to go.  It's awkward to sit there for \"full service\"...  They offered me a bag this time which is great!  But that again helped me to forget about silverware and napkins...  It should be part of the process to offer silverware/napkins for obviously to-go orders.  They're slowly but surely making some changes in the right direction!  As I've said, I'm a huge fan of the salads and desserts so this really helps in my ability to incorporate this spot into my life!",

    "text": "NOT SERVICE ANIMAL FRIENDLY :(   My friends and I were enjoying our meal when the executive chef came out to the dining area and asked if our animal was a service animal. Which was fine. He did not ask what service or task the animal is trained to do-which is what he is only allowed to ask. He instead just asked what the dog is for and stated that if he really was a service animal then he wouldn't be riding in a stroller and that we needed to leave. I'm sorry it's over 100 degrees outside and it's unacceptable for a dog to walk on hot pavement?  We're regulars here and have never had an issue before, and unfortunately I do not think we will be back.  Anyways, the red velvet gelato was good. Not something I'd probably go back to get again though.",

    "text": "I may be missing the point of this place, so I do plan on giving it another shot.  I came here with mom and sis recently on a beautiful Sat afternoon... I ordered mom a sandwich and I had their burger on their house english muffin... would have been a tasty combination if the patty meat hadn't been almost raw.  Mom's sandwich was good according to her, she ate it but certainly didn't talk about it like she's talked about other places I've taken her to eat.  I also ordered a latte in a for-here cup.  So the reason this wasn't a 4 stars for me: 1) I personally ordered 3 things and had to WAIT at 3 different stations for each thing.. very frustrating when your latte is ready and it's starting to get cold and your sandwich (mom's) comes out way earlier than your burger.. so now you're mom is eating because her sandwich will get cold, your coffee is getting cold at your table because you have to be standing up by the burger place to finally get your hot, yet kinda raw, burger.  Super frustrating and I think this was the key reason why I didn't enjoy my visit here...   The food was decent, but really was not that special enough to warrant the frustration of waiting at three different places for food (that arrive at totally different times) and then ultimately not enjoying the experience because of that.  I'll give it one more shot because my friends swear it's awesome... but I wish they operated more seamlessly.",

    "text": "Campbell and 40th is my favorite food intersection in Phoenix so far.   The food itself is probably worth 4 stars but I'm going to bump it up for Courtney, our server who was great. Prompt, efficient, friendly.  This place is actually very reasonably priced if you order the right things.  Each pizza is enough to share (as stated on the menu) but we were ambitious and ordered more than enough. Thus, it allowed for us to sample different kinds and take some home which I'm def not complaining about.  The tap beer prices are also a great deal if you order the growler and split among friends. I'll probably buy the jug next time, which you can bring back and get even more discounts on a refill.  Pizzas had a great crust, like a thin crunchy asiago flatbread. Don't forget to add the freebies like onion, garlic, egg, chiles, and extra love. Very good. Friends had gelato and a red velvet cupcake that they said were enjoyable.  Atmosphere is spot on for a joint in Arcadia. Server correctly split our bill without hassle.   Pizza, beer, fun. I'm going to find a fat, lazy day where I just go back and forth between Postino and LGO.",

Three other employees asked me if I needed assistance, all seeming very confused.  At 2:15, my salad finally appeared, and was basically thrown at me by the server - without apology!  I ordered the Thai  chicken salad.  It was a meager serving, for $10.00.  It also was very bland tasting.   Very unimpressed with the food, service and overall attitude of LGO.

    "text": "I cannot say enough great things about this outstanding restaurant (or grocery store?).  The ambiance is top notch, we felt connected yet were able to carry out our own conversation.  The dim lighting was perfect against the wood table backdrop, with plenty of light.  The waitress we had was super friendly, paid for our deserts because it was our first time (wow!), and really went out of her way to make perfect suggestions.  Honestly, our waitress was one of the reasons we had such a great time.  Amazing.  But, let's make no mistake about it - it's the food that really counts - and this was no disappointment.  Starting out we got the recommended draft beer and settled right in, ready for an appetizer.  My wife convinced me to order just ONE, and so we got the baked Chicken Wings (small - 6).  As a twist I ordered them EXTRA CRISPY.  Wow!  Please order this if you go and enjoy every drop of the delicious blue cheese dressing with those wings.  The chicken was tender/moist, the skin was crisp, it was a perfect compliment to the beer... but now we were ready for pizza.    For the main course we ordered TWO pizzas - Gladiator and Mushroom Party.  Wow.  I mean the Gladiator is a classic sausage and pepperoni pizza that fell from heaven and into our mouths.  We devoured it.  The Mushroom Party was exotic and risky (for us), with about 3 different mushrooms, some sweet onion and even fennel.  It was amazing and blew us away - very different from the Gladiator.  There were no leftovers from the two pizzas.  Our small 2.5 year old daughter helped us with the Mushroom Party pizza and had nothing but smiles on her face.  For desert we enjoyed gelato.  Two in fact!  I don't know how we found room, but they were great.  We did a Butter Pecan and Carmel.    This restaurant is one of the highlights of our Phoenix trip and we'll be back as soon as we can get out there again.  If you're in the Phoenix area - make the effort, enjoy the wait with friends/family, you won't be disappointed.",

We have been coming here since 2007, but I'm just now getting around to reviewing it as I'm eating a leftover slice of roasted corn pizza at my desk right now.  Everything is delicious, but the roasted corn & rocket man are my Truest loves.  The roasted corn is perfectly balanced & would be the pizza I would choose as my last meal if it had to be pizza.  The sweetness of the corn, the creamy-yet-tangy zing of the goat cheese, the acidic & juicy splash of the tomatoes, the herbaceous freshness from the basil....simply perfection.    And the rocket man kicks a$$, too!  Who knew broccoli was so good on pizza?  And the sun-dried tomatoes on that pizza are like tiny red flavor bombs.  The sourdough crust serves as the perfect vessel for all their pies, with a perfect chewiness & flavor profile of its own.  Also, as others have mentioned, do not skip the pimento cheese (just get the chip/dip platter).  It is incredible.  Also also, their wings.  So damn good.  Not at all buffalo style, but made with a slightly sweet yet spicy flavor.  They are grilled (or baked in the blistering pizza oven) so that there is a slight char to them that is out of this world.",

I wish I lived closer to buy them to just make at home!  The pizza is great, airy crust and great sauce. I know it sounds stupid, but the pepperoni are so big that they pull everything off with them. First world problems and personal preference I suppose.  Their gelato is just pure heaven... I would buy it by the gallon if I could!! I had the peanut butter chocolate and it was fantastic. I can't wait to try other flavors!  Their location is always busy, I can't seem to find a time to go there and not be in a crowd. Great for them!! However, with the crowded store it makes it uncomfortable while waiting in line, there's no where to really wait for your food. The store knick-knacks are cool but there's just so many that it's just overwhelming. The seating area is the same, very crowded and hard to move between tables. It's a great problem to have, but definitely need to figure out how to handle their large numbers of fans!",

First off, I am usually avoiding airport food except for La Grande Orange at Phoenix Sky Harbor, where the pizzas are absolutely cheesy, tasty and delicious.  We thought we would try the neighborhood version that all the cool kids refer to as \"LGO.\"  Knowing how absolutely delicious the airport version of their cheese pizza was, we ordered two.  They both were essentially crispy overcooked Matzoh with a little cheese on them; definitely no where near the quality of (and I can't believe I am saying this) The Airport Food version!  The barbecue wings were even gross, undercooked, chewy, veiny chicken drums and wings that I would not even feed to my dogs.  It was as-though they painted un-marinated wings with BBQ sauce with a smoky flavor.  Gross.  These meals are not cheap, topping out over $40, for a poor meal.  I gave the wings one star; the pizza three stars; rounded out it is two stars.  Cmon, LGO - yes we love thin crust, crispy pizza, but not when there's a transparent layer of cheese and sauce.",

I went during lunch, and it was busy (as usual), but services was fast and effective.  I order the hot Sammy Boy turkey sandwich without mayo, and it was quite tasty.  In the past, I've only been for dinner; so, it was a nice change (and efficient) to order from the Garage side.  There are a lot of sandwiches and salads to order, and they call your name when your food is ready.  The sandwiches have a side of watermelon, which I wasn't aware of before ordering. I'm actually allergic to watermelon; so, I didn't eat mine.  It's a different choice for a side vs chips or fries; so, I think it makes sense.  I just wish I had known that before ordering in case there had been a substitute.",

The pizzeria bar is awesome!  It's a small space, but it's very cozy and inviting.   We went during happy hour (3pm-6pm, even on weekends!!) and was happily greeted with $5 specialty cocktails with beer and wine specials.  We went for the specialty drinks (Negroni for me, and a Your Money or Your Life for him) and were incredibly pleased with how refreshing and delicious they were!  We also split the Shrimp Ceviche, and the Green Chile Burger.  I would 100% order either of these items again; the shrimp was fresh and had nice acidity, and the burger was lick-your-fingers good.  You can taste the freshness of the ingredients in their food :)  Next time you are craving some LGO, consider popping into the bar area and enjoying your meal among the people!!  It's definitely worth checking out and we can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "LGO Hospitality deserves a great deal of credit for making the Arcadia neighborhood a foodie destination.  Upward Projects and Fox Restaurants get some props for that too, but LGO thus far has kept its AZ operations restricted to just the Arcadia neighborhood, giving the area a number of popular restaurants they can call their own (LGO Grocery, Ingo's, Buck & Rider, and Chelsea's Kitchen).  My experiences with LGO's restaurants haven't been perfect, but I really don't have many negative things to say about their food.  LGO Grocery in particular has a tremendous assortment of goodies for breakfast and lunch as well as a great variety of baked goods on hand.  Parking is atrocious and the snaking lines inside can be quite a nuisance, but the end result makes it worth the trouble as I can attest to from numerous breakfast outings here.  Having not yet tried the pizza menu before, I figured a mid-afternoon trip on Sunday would help avoid the long lines in the parking lot and inside (and it did).  So let's review.  I mistakenly thought that the pizzeria was its own separate operation such that I could grab a seat and I'd be helped by wait staff.  After a few minutes of seeing no wait staff, it became clear that ordering pizza here is just like ordering other items.  Wait in those snaking lines in the grocery area.  Fortunately the mid-afternoon lines weren't too bad (less than a 5 minute wait in line).   By the time I'd reached the register, I knew what to do.  A half and half pizza (because if you don't have to, why choose just one option?).  On one half of my pie, the Avocado pizza.  On the other half, the Fallen Angel pizza.  Total cost including tax came to $17.  Just as with LGO Grocery, go grab a seat in the main dining room and wait for someone to yell out your order at the prep area.  With about 7 minutes, the pizza chef yelled my name up front.  The Avocado pizza is a relatively simple recipe consisting of avocado, tomatoes, lemon zest, basil and cheese.  The Fallen Angel is a little more complex with housemade sausage, fennel, roasted peppers, cheese and tomato sauce.  The pizza is 12\" just as most similar neapolitan style pizzerias do it (Pomo, Cibo, etc.), but here its made in a conventional oven rather than a wood fired one.  Despite that fact, the crust on LGO's pizza is dynamite.  Much crispier than most thin crust pies I've had, but still soft enough on the inside to give it the perfect texture.  Both sides of my pizza were pretty solid.  The Fallen Angel half was my favorite of the two thanks largely to the more complex flavor profile (I was particularly impressed with the peppers), but the Avocado was still a good clean pizza that any vegetarian would enjoy.  Thanks to the mid-afternoon timing, I was in and out within 30 minutes no problem.  During prime time though, you'll wanna reserve some extra time for the lines inside and out.  I was quite pleased overall with the pizza I had and can understand the draw of this place for dinner.  I still wish parking was more ample and that they could reorganize the grocery store to make the lines more manageable (or better yet, hire a wait staff), but the food pretty much speaks to why people endure these inconveniences.  Arcadia foodie pride is understandably high thanks to this busy corner of 40th Street & Campbell.  With all the success this place has had, I'm pretty sure we'll be seeing many more new concepts from LGO Hospitality before long.",

It's hard to pull off both in the same location, but La Grande Orange does it amazingly well!  The food is delicious, although a little on the spendy side in my opinion (Think $7.50 - $10 for an egg sandwich, a la carte)They also have tons of little knick knacks, tshirts, and plants for sale, and a little wine shop in the corner!  The only downside is the parking (almost impossible) and the lack of space when it's busy (which is almost always).  But if you don't mind eating your sandwich in a cramped corner next to the door, you're gonna be hard pressed to find anything else you DON'T like about this place.  Highly recommended!",

We arrived after discovering Pizzeria Bianco had a 4-5 hour wait. We called LGO ahead and asked if they were very busy and they said they weren't. Once we arrived we were seated immediately and decided what we wanted and waited. And waited... It was 20 minutes late, and a couple that had just been seated had a waiter immediately. That's when we knew they forgot us, I'm sure the pizza would have been good, but I think customer service is a huge deal so we got outta there! On they way home we decided to order Hungry Howie's instead. Oh well, we were ready to spend $40 on pizza but $20 tasted better anyway.  So, zero stars for being ignored!",

I've been back many times and will continue frequenting. The grocery is like a place of little treasures you can't find anywhere else. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is seeking, flavors, fun, adventure, and just that \"wow I found a new great place\" kind of experience. :)",

Im not even from phoenix, but shortly stayed there years ago and i still remember this pizza like it was yesterday. I also saw a really odd bird with a crazy beak. he was a funny lil thing.   ok so the pizza, i think the cheese made it spectacular. It also had corn and goat cheese, yeah im pretty much in love with it. It aint your moms pizza. It was just sooo good, melted in your mouth, new flavors, new ideas, great lil spot with outdoor seating, boos and good food. It def made a huge impression and i will prob always think of it as the best place i ever had pizza in the USA. two enthusiastic thumbs up.",

    "text": "I have only been this once (so far) but I really had a great meal tonight.  Our pizza was a great sourdough and the cheese was a marvelous blend that I just haven't found anywhere in Phoenix.  The waitress took the time to really help us tailor our meal to our particular tastes and her wine suggestion was spot on.  We ordered the gladiator pizza (adding mushrooms and ham).  The wings we got were a bit fatty so they suggested I let them throw them back on the grill a bit longer to crisp them up a bit more.  That did the trick and they were a great BBQ chicken wing flavor.  After they did all this and I'd been made happy, the manager came over and asked how they were and said he'd taken it off the bill.  Wow, not expected.  Specially since they were great and I'd get them again in fact, thank you.  The one thing about the meal that really stuck out was the deserts.  The chocolate, peanut butter, ganache, and gram cracker pie was so good.  The walnut brownie we rich, chewy, and everything was so fresh tasting.  The strawberry gelato was obviously fresh berries and I could have just eaten a bowl of that by itself.  I know it sounds like I'm gushing here, but it's just so great to me when I find places like this.  Thanks for the great night.",

The sourdough crust is what makes the pizza, as do the high quality topics. My fave are avocado pizza with prosciutto, the mushroom one, and the gladiator (with sausage). Their breakfast, sandwich, and salad menus are excellent as well! It's fun to hang out in the \"grocery\" store next door where you can get good cheese, wine, bread, and little kitschy things. Their white sangria is the BOMB! And you can't beat the $6 bloodys and mimosas on the weekends. With the family-friendly laid back atmosphere and fun for all, this is a True Phoenix gem.",

Ours was the olive combo (green and black) with broccoleta. We've had wonderful black olives bursting with flavor, not on this pizza. Green olives can be flavorless and these were in this category. Olives out of a can, not gourmet by any stretch. This is a pretty pretentious place, but pizza is lackluster.",

This night I had the goat cheese pizza, my party ordered the Gladiator Pizza and the veggie pizza on thin crust.  All of the pies were excellent.

I ordered a kids pizza and it came with marinara topped with cheese on a split English muffin.  I wasn't sure if my little cutie pie would like it...it was a winner!  He asked me to make one just like it at home.    We shared a pumpkin pie and oatmeal cookie. The pie could have been a tad deeper.  It was very good and creamy, but looked like they ran out of filling it was spread pretty thin.  We liked the casual ambiance...we're planning to come back for breakfast!!!",

Pick a table in the center of the dining room and vegetatively sit and stare out of the large plate glass windows wondering why, between Mastro's the previous night, El Santo all day Saturday, and the Candy Store, you somehow managed to blow just over 700 bucks this weekend.  LGO is a charm with its high energy young crowd adorned in yoga pants, and, its older hipsters, also wearing yoga pants.It would appear this place is some kind of Mecca for yoga pant aficionados.  The music is cool too. A friend recently spent the day here working, Shazaming their playlists. She found most of the songs on Pandora's 'Lumineers' station.  Anyway, I ate a chopped turkey salad, or at least a part of it while pensively gazing out the window, as If I was working on a cure for dick cancer or something.  The salad and a soda was ten bucks.  This is a great move, staring out of windows. Others will think you're an eccentric genius or something as you mindlessly stare directly through them while revisiting your bonehead moves from the weekend. A chuckle to yourself every now and again as you think about how Mastro's gets away with charging 11 bucks for a baked potato, and how a certain stripper at the Candy Store will pull out her False teeth for only a buck.   [another wave of nausea, hang on a sec]  As I said, this is a great place to feel good about yourself when you get a load of how other people are more screwed-up than yourself. Granny hipsters in unfulfilled (pancake butt) yoga pants that oddly enough, manage to somehow telegraph the outline of an equally loose fitting thong.  Now there's a nice 'eewww' moment.  I yakked up the salad afterwards, but it had nothing to do with the food or the ill-fitted thongs. I think it was the hard-boiled egg and my hellacious hangover. The thong visual was pretty messed up though. Anyway, a strong recommend.",

My cousin drives up from Tucson to get an LGO fix way more often than she would probably care to admit.  =)    I've tried probably every pizza on the menu.  My absolute favorite is the roasted corn pizza with sausage added.  I have some leftovers in my fridge as I write this, in fact.  Mmmm!   That pizza just blows my mind every single time I order it!   The classic margherita pizza is always a hit too, it's just so fresh and made to perfection.  Order the roasted corn - add sausage if you're a meat eater and enjoy this little slice of heaven!   If you're thinking about an appetizer, you can't go wrong with the chip plate - the pimento dip is amazing - it just tastes like a cheese dip with a little kick/heat to it.  The guacamole is always so fresh and delicious too.  A favorite spot for guac.  I don't personally care for the salsa though, but I'm happy to leave that to others and go for the guacamole and pimento dip!    Stop by at the market for some delicious dessert on your way out.  Vegan apple cinnamon cookie is surprisingly great. The sea salt chocolate chip cookie can't be beaten.  Or get yourself some gelato or a cupcake, you can't go wrong.    Everyone will enjoy your meal here.  It's one of my favorite treats and how I love to show off Phoenix to visiting friends!   Great job LGO!!",

    "text": "Just stopped in doe a quick treat and was helped by the rudest employee I've ever encountered at LGO. She didn't smile once, seemed annoyed to serve me and then waded up my receipt and when I asked for it she was like oh here and handed me the waded up receipt. This was after the other employees while asking other customers around me didn't even ask if I needed help or was waiting for food, just walked away ignoring me. Their customer service has definitely gone way down in recent months as has many of their bakery treats Such a disappointment. They use to be such a wonderful, friendly customer service orientated establishment with fabulous food and a fun gift shop. Hope things improve at some point.  RESPONSE TO BUSINESS'S RESPONSE: The personal attack in response to my negative review is inappropriate and goes against everything that Yelp does stand for. Yelp is a forum for the good and the bad and companies should never attack reviewers. My complaints over the volume of LGO's music have no baring on my recent Yelp reviews for your business as my last contact with LGO Corporate was back in March. My reviews come from experiences of poor food and my one experience of an employee who did not fit with the normal happy, go-lucky employees I have grown very accustom to at LGO. Despite any issues I have had with LGO, I continued to frequent the establishment and have had a couple poor experiences that I chose to Yelp about because I miss the amazing morning bun and other wonderful pastries and hoped management would address the concerns. I find it crazy that initially I was offered an e-comp and then instead of receiving that, i was attacked because I chose to Yelp about my experiences inside the store after filing a complaint months ago with corporate about something completely different and unattached to my Yelp reviews. In my first Yelp review although i gave a low score due to the lack of consistency with food I also wrote, \"...this place is truly wonderful and has great employees\" And in both reviews I stated I hoped that it would improve at some point. Either way personal attacks are unwarranted.",

    "text": "Coming here on a Friday night will be a for sure wait of 30-45 minutes- with no reservations taken. Luckily their grocery next door is stocked with trinkets of all sorts (i.e. La grande orange t-shirts, phoenix t-shirts, 7 year pen, candles, soap, books and all kinds of goodies). If you're looking to pick up food, the grocery store has pre-made salads, gelato, desserts and to-go menu items available. There are cheeses and wines to purchase to go and at the table. If you're not into the browsing of items then there is an open bar area to grab a drink.   Within 30 minutes the hostess found me and said the table will be ready in a minute! Purchased a Pinot noir for the table of 5. Henry the waiter grabbed waters and lemon for us at the start. We did the family style and ordered 12 piece wings (which we were jipped by one lonely wing) and they were darn good with a bit of char; shrimp ceviche with chips; chopped salad with pepperoni; and roasted corn pizza.   Wings came out first with celery sticks and radish halves. Full of meat on those bones. Then the roasted corn pizza was next with sprinkled roasted corn and sliced tomatoes all over the pizza that was married to the cheese with floating leaves of basil. Ceviche was served in a goblet drink ware filled with chunks of shrimp, chopped onions and tomatoes topped with avocado pieces. Add a squeeze of lime to enhance the flavors.  Salad looked like for a serving for one. We were not quite full and went with another half order of wings and another roasted corn pizza. Done.   Not quite yet. Made room for dessert: mint choc chip scoop and salted caramel scoop of gelato. Yum!   Only part to not getting the full 5 stars was our waters were never filled. I drank my water to the last drop with not even an ice cube to melt. Overall, dining experience and food choices were a 4 star. I'll be back very soon.",

The wine/ beer and drink list is also great, and I love that they have a locally grown vegetable side dish/ appetizer.  It's kind of loud in the restaurant, so be prepared for that, but it works. Service is friendly and quick, but if you have to wait for a table, make sure you explore the adjoining market!",

    "text": "i have been here multiple times for their pizza. their crust is to die for! it is made with sourdough and just so fucking good! some of the pizzas could use a little more toppings tho, but for the most part i am satisfied eating here. their pizzas are good for two people to share, or at times when i came really hungry and ordered a pizza with not as many ingredients, i could finish one. im sure an average guy could come here and consume a whole one to himself. service here is hit or miss. most of the servers dont come back around very often once your pizza is delivered. ive had to flag servers down here a few times. but it is nice sometimes because when i dont want to be bothered like when i am on my laptop, i get the solitude i want with the pizza that i crave. oh yea! that is another great thing here, they have wifi! a pizza place with wifi!! i know! exciting! also their kale salad is pretty decent here. it is on the sweeter side if you like that. It's a fruity kale salad.",

There was a bit of a wait, but i think it was worth it, and chilling in the grocery was a perfect way to kill the time!  We shared a delicious salad, the orange fennel, and some ceviche, then had 2 pizzas so we'd be sure to have leftovers to take home. The salad was by far my favorite part of the meal. Absolutely perfect with mandarin oranges, fennel, goat cheese and champagne vinaigrette. To die for. The ceviche was refreshing and tasty and i really enjoyed the wild mushroom party pizza. Several different varieties of fungi, and again, more fennel. The Fallen Angel pizza was good, but i was not expecting the flavor of the sausage.   Overall, we were very impressed with the food and we'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "I have to laugh at the suggestion that this restaurant is a pizzeria. It is much, much more than that. It is a fabulous gathering place of European design for locals dining with friends, or as in our case out of town visitors dining with local friends. It is bustling, if not somewhat crowded, but no one seems to mind. People are quite friendly as they stand in line to order, wait for their food to be placed on the pass to take to their own table, or pour their own coffee.   We entered through the backdoor, which actually leads you right through the kitchen. It's a bit of a fun adventure for someone who enjoys cooking, and restaurant ways, as I do. Once inside the restaurant is divided into two main rooms. One where you order most entrees, desserts, and coffee drinks, and the other containing the pizzeria.   I was disappointed to get to the front of the line to learn that they were out of my first choice, chilaquiles, but quite happy after tasting my croque madame. The ham was very tasty. And to think that I was actually considering giving up pork at one time. My lady's French crepes were delicious. She must have thought so also because I believe that she only offered me one bite. Shame, shame!   Although I didn't try it, the pizza looked fabulous. They looked a lot like the homemade pizzas that I have been making, but better of course. Next time I will definitely go for a pizza.   The peanut butter chocolate pie that we shared was just alright, but many of the other desserts looked tasty. However, if you only have limited capacity, I would suggest that you pass on dessert and get one of their homemade English muffins instead. The best I have ever had.",

    "text": "Woah talk about confusing, starting with the entrance - we walked in through the back door, right through the kitchen.. still not sure if that was actually an acceptable thing to do. Nobody said anything if it wasn't. Then what? Looked around for a hostess, didn't see one - were we supposed to seat ourselves or get in line? Which line? The big one going out the door? The coffee station? The pastry station? Did we have to go to each one for something different? Would have asked somebody if there had been anyone to ask. Like I said, confusing. Won't be that way for you, of course, because I'm going to lay it all out for you...  Ok, so there ain't really all that much to lay out.. It's pretty simple, actually. Split up, that's my advice - one of yous grab a table - there aren't many when they're busy - and somebody else get in line - doesn't matter which one. We ordered everything we needed from the coffee station. Apparently that's a secret, because the other one was going out the door, like I said.  The food - we shared the french pancakes, these super thin little slices of Heaven, and the tofu \"chorizo\" burrito. Rockin' good breakfast. Very tasty, and a nice change of pace. Beware: the orange juice is freshly squeezed and jam packed with pulp. Cool if that's your thing, not so much if it ain't.  And in retrospect, all that confusion - was all kind of part of the charm of the place. Weird, huh?",

    "text": "I guess it was bound to happen, people grow apart, love doesn't always last.  It's hard enough to park at your place, but I'd always finagle a way. Just to be near you. Then the neighbors started blocking the side road options, but I was willing to walk to be with you.  I had noticed your growing libido and sophistication, you got into wine. Sometimes you drank too much, but I wasn't concerned, you were witty, you were upscale, you won awards. So you got a bit arrogant and cocky, who wouldn't with all the sudden acclaim?   I thought with time you'd chill out and we'd be cool again.  When you started sharing your fantasies about some Italian chick from Milano, I was somewhat jealous, but you said there was plenty of you to go around. Maybe that would have been the case if you didn't move her into the same block where we hung together. Did you really have to crowd me out that way?  I should have seen the signs back then, but I didn't want to. I'd come by and you were always so busy. I don't want to cramp your style, but I missed your flavor baby. I didn't want to be too clingy, so I didn't come by as often.   Every now and then I'd think back to our first date. The flickering candle and the juicy large grilled wings. Your wings were so good and tempted again I'd head out. On the way I remembered a more recent visit when your wings, like your feelings had started to change. Sometimes burnt, sometimes cold. Your mind wasn't on us, baby. Your mood swings were getting out of control. I suspected that your attention was all on that lovely Milano Chick, but she's a fling and I'm the real deal, so I let you be.  Weeks would go by before I'd talk myself into spending some time with you. I started to be more creative when we made love, customizing the toppings despite the surcharges piling up. Taking our traditional 13 dollar item straight into the stratosphere. Oh you tasted great this way, but the price of these visits were starting to hurt.   I soothed my hurt feelings with the richness of Arlecchino next door. Yeah, if you can love an Italian, so could I baby. He was always willing to lend an ear, to let me cry on his shoulder when you were too busy to give a damn.   I told him about the time when I came over and sat on the couch for 20 minutes before you even realized you had company.  You had one of your hipster friends serve me some drinks, telling me you were in the back and would be right out, but you never came. I walked out in tears, but not before a quickie with Arlecchino.   And how another time you made me pay for your bad wings and I didn't catch it on the bill until later, that was underhanded and cold. Arlecchino just nodded and gave me two free samples. He's a considerate partner.  After I walked out that night, you hardly ever called me, but my cravings for the memories of the past would sometimes return. I think of the night we shared that roasted corn and goat cheese, that pitcher of Stella Artois and you introduced me to all your new hipster friends.   So when I came by on Sunday afternoon I was puzzled.  You didn't even greet me at the door with a smile. I let myself in. Where did all your hipster friends go, LGO? I was determined not to just sit on the couch being ignored again.  I'll be patient, I'm sure you'll be right over.  So hungry for you, I glimpsed a blond over in the kitchen. I had to know, did she know where you were? Oh, she said, looking at me like I was your mother not lover she said  \"Those hipster friends don't hang here, just get in line over there and help yourself.\"   So shocked, you're just a whore now to everyone.   I'm supposed to go over to the meat market, stand in line with the rest of your bitches, tell you what I want without even a welcoming kiss of attention and then get it myself when it's ready? Or I can call ahead and you'll leave some love note on a counter for me to pick up and take home to read alone?  This is how you roll? I'm not even worth a goodbye hug?  So I'm leaving my own little love note to you with my BFF Yelp.  \"Baby, when I come over to your place, I want to sit down, be with you one on one, maybe chat with some of your friends. Have them bring me the warm lemon towel when you get my fingers all sticky.  I don't want to wait in line like a Mcdonald's, for your attentions, then go serve it to myself. If I wanted to self pleasure I wouldn't be on a date. I finally get it. You're just not that into me anymore. You know what, the feeling is mutual. Consider your poser ass dumped.\"",

    "text": "I have been hearing about LGO from friends for years so I finally decided to give it a try. My sister and I went on a Friday after work, we used the complimentary valet and went inside and were immediately seated. I'm really not a very picky person when it comes to food or drinks. However, when I had a sip of the lemonade I felt like a baby tasting a lemon for the first time it was incredibly sour. To be sure it wasn't just me I had my sister taste it and she immediately made a sour face. I added two packets of Splenda and more water and it was still incredibly sour. I ended up just asking the server to switch my drink to an iced tea because the lemonade was too sour which she quickly did. Now let's move on to the food; my sister and I shared. We ordered a plate of fries as our appetizer which were crispy and came with a sauce that was really good. For our main course we ordered a pizza half Fallen Angel and half Gladiator. Our food came out fairly quickly and looked good. The pizza was okay and I liked the fallen Angel  better than the Gladiator. Was it the best pizza I've ever had? No. My biggest complaint about the pizza was that every time I went to pick up a slice everything fell right off the slice and onto my plate so I had to keep putting he toppings back on my crust. Overall, our server was great she was polite and attentive without being overbearing. The atmosphere was nice, the music not too loud, and the tables were not crowded together. I was actually shocked at how reasonable the price ended up being about $25 for two drinks, fries and a pizza. While I wasn't blown away by the food I will likely return at some point in the future to re-evaluate the food as my expectations may have been set far to high due to my friend's raving.   P.S-I did take a peek at market and felt as if the little knick knacks were fairly overpriced. They were charging $14 for an identical set of coasters I had seen earlier that day at Michaels on sale for $2.50 originally $5.",

One complaint would be some inconsistency with the salads - don't get me wrong, they always taste great but the size varies quite often. The burgers are usually pretty good but the meat always seems under seasoned.   Minor complaints that won't keep me from eating that stuff again.",

Either quite good or nearly non-existent, depending on when you go.   Went this morning, and sat for 20 minutes and even made eye contact with a server, but they ignored me, and kept walking by my table like I didn't exist. I finally got the attention of one of them and was told \"Oh, uh...sorry dude, you gotta go to the counter and order. We don't have full service until 5. Sorry man.\"  I used to really love this place, but the last couple of times I've gone, I just ended up walking out because even when they are full service, it's still quite slow. Sadly, this place is too popular for its own good.   That said, the pizza and the gelato are really good, and if you have a lot more patience than me, it's worth a shot.",

Sorry but when you go out to dinner you shouldn't have to deal with attitude having wait staff and managers.  The pizza was very very average, maybe they had an off night?  The desserts were all fantastic. Although we couldn't order them with our meal the way we were told we could in the bakery area. So we had to finish up, pay and then go back to the bakery area to buy desserts.  The good: Salt on the tables is a very good salt and as a chef myself I appreciate that. The desserts are top shelf. Artichoke heart dish was interestingly yummy.  The bad: Service was horrible. Manager was rude. Pizza was decent at best.   Will probably stop in for desserts if ever in the area but would'nt step foot in the restaurant side again unless it was free.",

For being in such a cool neighborhood, and for having such great food, the prices are really reasonable as well!  My favorite example being the fact that you can get a 60 oz re-usable jug of beer for just 10 bucks...and if you bring it back, they refill it for you for only 10 bucks as well.    The staff is super friendly and personable and can remember faces even if you've only been here a few times.  Once, we were there on a Friday night when it was particularly busy.  We had to wait for about 35 minutes for food- which is longer than average (but still not bad)...so the waiter gave us our appetizers and dessert on the house!  We hadn't even complained!",

They tend to be busy around dinner time, but trust me the wait is worth it, plus you can wonder around the shop next door and buy some cool nic-nacks, wine or coffee. They also have a counter to order food from if you don't want to sit down and you can take your food to go.   We have eaten here several times and love it! I love trying different types of hot wings, and theirs are awesome! They are a flavor you are sure to enjoy and cannot get anywhere else. Perfectly spicy with that kick in the back of your throat and tons of flavor.   You must check out their win list, tons to choose from and all price point anyone can afford to buy a bottle. We got a yummy Malbec that was only $13.99. Winning! After we enjoyed some wings we shared a couple pizzas.... The Gladiator (sausage, pepperoni and basically meat lovers) and a Margarita. Both amazing! The crust is perfection. I wanted to finish the whole thing, but couldn't.... I had to leave room for some dessert. We shared the Sea Salt Cookie with vanilla gelato, wow so good, I had to ask someone to remove it from the table so I didn't turn into a complete glutton.   Moral of the story, LGO is awesome... and I hear there is one in the air port now, sweet!",

It was packed.   The food is pretty good here. Not bad, but nothing outstanding. My main complaint is with the service. Very slow, inattentive.... for a place that comes so highly recommended ...I think the staff feels they don't have to try very hard and it shows. We ordered a pitcher of the \"Shakin' Lemondade\" and we ASKED our waitress ahead of time how many glasses we could get out of it. I think she said 5 or 6. NO WAY. It came, she put the glasses down and started pouring...MAYBE 4 of us got enough lemonade. When one of us said, \"Oh I thought you said this would be enough...?\" She rudely said, \"Oh you'll need another pitcher for all of you\". That's why we asked first, honey. It was a very good drink but NOT worth the price tag.   I am just over these douche-y, pretentious Phoenix restaurants that have crappy service but get away with it just because of the name of the place. We're in Phoenix, not New York City. Get over yourselves.",

If you want to enjoy some nice wine, you can select a bottle from the grocery store connected to the restaurant and enjoy it with your meal.  Instead of crayons and paper, they have wikki sticks for the kids.  Although parking is limited, they offer comp valet, and the valet guys are always fast and nice.

I have had about half of the pizza styles from here, and I have liked all of them (even goat cheese, which I used to think I would HATE!!)

The thin crust pizza is excellent and rivals other thin crust producers in the Valley, namely Grimaldi's.  I thoroughly love the types of cheese that they put on their pizzas, including the goat cheese on the Roasted Corn Pizza.    As part of my last meal on this earth, I would request their delectable baked chicken wings.  I didn't know baking was such a critical component to making tasty wings, but after comparing these to all the deep friend wings I've had at bars and such, I now know better.  These wings are consistently meaty, juicy and flavorful.  You'll have to try for yourself to taste the difference, but I know you won't be disappointed.  And to top things off the Blue Cheese  dipping sauce may make you want to take a keg of it home with you.  It's that good.    My wife also brings me a chocolate chip (with salt) cookie from the adjacent grocery store-a wonderful way to end a great dinner.  I'll reserve that last star when I finally visit the restaurant.  **Tip**  Sign up for their e-club to get a birthday certificate",

They bought hand cream, candles, and I bought a cute card... Next came the dinner part: First of all my boyfriend and I can share a pizza together and be content, so my stepdad says, \"well, we'll need at least 3 then between the four of us!\" Holy chubby's! ;) We got the Gladiator, the men shared the mushroom and pepperoni, and the ladies shared the avocado. I don't think even a crumb was left by the time we were done!  Mom and I did decide that next time we'll get the avocado but we want spinach instead of the basil! Oh and be careful of the lemonade- delicious but sour! It's fresh they make it there!   I recommend any item on the menu- we have never had a poor experience with the food or staff! Thanks LGO! Oh, and my stepdad says he's still having dreams over how great the sour dough pizzas were!",

We were greeted by a friendly, happy waitress that was on top of everything all night!  We had to try their special Caprese salad, which was served with roasted tomatoes and slightly warmed mozzarella.  The roasted tomatoes were a different taste, but it was flavorful.  We also shared the chips and quac appetizer, which came with a pimento dip and salsa.  We knew what a pimento was - but this dip didn't taste like what you would expect.  When we asked our waitress, she was able to tell us that it didn't contain any pimento but was able to list off other ingredients.  Impressive!    Getting stuffed, somehow we managed to move on to 3 pizzas - the Margarita, the Gladiator, and the vegan Mother Earth.  Yes, they are big enough for two but we just couldn't decide on what to share!  All were delicious, and my vegan sister was impressed with the Mother Earth in all it's veggie goodness.    The food was delicious, service was spot on, environment was cozy - one of my favorite restaurants!",

We decided to share a salad and a pizza and were told to take a pre-made salad from the fridge near the front of the store . I felt like a sardine squishing threw all the people in line trying to get into the fridge and then I almost wasn't able to reach my Sonoma Salad because it was against the back and hard for me to reach .  Next we needed to wait in the pizza area for the pie and all the seats were filled . I noticed a nice mixed crowd of people but there were many Hipsters just hanging out reading or playing on their computers taking up space . I spotted  couple leaving from the community table so we jumped into that spot . The people leaving cleared the plates and I brushed the crumbs off our area .   I was given the wrong Ice tea and got a fruity one instead of a plain one I just drank it . ( no big deal) The Sonoma Salad was very large and had really good cheese in it so it was good but not \"Slap your Momma Good\" because it had very little taste other than the cheese .  So now we get our pizza we ordered the one that has Rocket in the name that was suppose to be spicy . THIS PIZZA WAS NOT SPICY . It was edible , it was OK  and pretty looking but not that tasty and lacking seasoning especially SALT and the cheese wasn't ooey or gooey but I did LIKE that the crust was super thin . I have tried food from here from the free food event on Camelback Rd and also from the Art Museum and it seemed a level higher than what I tried here so possibly it depends on what you order too .  While we were dining the Woman who sat across from us opened up a used germed up paper to read and since the table is so thin the newspaper was touching our plates and THAT BOTHERED US and than she kept yapping at us while we were trying to eat .   You won't feel lonely eating here .  This place has a novelty gift ware section to browse and the sell imported cheeses and house made English Muffins (6@ $9.95) You can purchase a bottle of Good Wine here at the market price and drink it here with no additional charge .",

    "text": "Ate dinner here last night after a long hiatus. I remember loving their burger and that was the main reason for my visit. My choices were b/n here or The Grind. I now wish we chose the Grind It's IMHO I prefer the sweet and spicy over at The grind for the same price (12). La Grande does a good job, the burger is huge and was cooked perfectly med-rare. It comes with a \"special sauce\", pickle, tomato, red onion. Very good. reminds me of a diner style burger. The fries were good as well.   We also had a gladiator pizza: topped with sausage and pepperoni. Not a fan of pepp so stuck with the burger. Place was packed like usual and service was decent. Ended my meal next door at their market with a mini coconut cupcake ($2). Solid meal.",

I am familiar with it 'cuz I grew up in the area and remember when it was a U-Totem convenience market. (OK, did I just date myself?)   I had actually avoided it because i heard that the parking was difficult and that it was inordinately crowded at all times.    Went there about 2 weeks ago.  My sibs scheduled a dinner visit there, and I went over around 7pm, mid-week, after work.      Parking was a bear- then i found the Valet.  I recommend- USE THE VALET.  You can get \"validated\" and then parking is free (except remember to tip the Dude, OK?)  My fam had ordered, which was fine with me.  Within minutes, a delicious fruit sangria was poured, and I delighted in the most yummy salad!  Pizzeria Chopped Salad, with its eclectic mix of raisins, sundried tomatoes, vinaigrette, and more.  I'm not a big fan of raisins, but don't let that throw you off of this salad- it's a perfect blend of ingredients.  I coulda hogged the salad, but played nice and shared.  They also ordered CLASSIC MARGHERITA Pizzas, which were sublime.  Brick oven flavor, awesome cheese, perfect balance of ingredients.    OK, OK, I'm going back!  I'll get over my impatient self, if this is what I have to look forward to.  Prices were in line with the quality and freshness of food.  Good professional wait staff.",

I got an avocado pizza which is amazing, though there was way too much basil on it. I took it off though! Avocado on a pizza is definitely a good choice, the lemon zest made it all even more delicious. I love the crust too. Atmosphere is nice too! It was a little crowded but not bad! It was clean too. Overall a great experience, I look forward to coming back!",

    "text": "Stopped by on a Sunday, but should warn you, it's not the typical LGO experience I'm used to. No table service in the restaurant seating area and nobody tells you that when you walk in. We sat at a table for a good 5 minutes, unknowing, while one of their employees misted us with window cleaner while cleaning the door behind us. We eventually asked, learned, and moved to the bar where they do have full service.   The full menu is not available, but they still serve pizzas and salads. The salads, however, will come in a t-go box (ugh). Unfortunately, we didn't consider how uncomfortable it would be to eat two salads and a pizza on a table that is really meant for holding cocktails. Note to self- do not sit in the bar if you are ordering food here.   So how was the food? I love the kale and quinoa salad- I get it every time I travel through terminal 4 (just don't want a to-go box when I'm in a restaurant). B liked the date and beet salad. We tried the vegan pizza- it had a good amount of toppings and I liked the cashew cheese, but the crust wasn't as good as I remember from this place.  Overall- fine, but don't know that we'll be back anytime soon.",

We can in through the back and it was very interesting walking through the kitchen, but as a former restaurant employee I thought it was pretty fun! The store was adorable! So many cute things to look at, fun and unique trinkets. We were seated in the dining room right away, which was impressive for a Friday evening. Our waiter Blair was very nice, fun, and efficient. Our glasses were never empty.  We decided to order three things and share them. We got the guacamole and pimento cheese dip, shredded kale and quinoa salad, and the Gladiator pizza. The salad was fantastic! I am not usually a kale fan but this was super tasty I loved the sweetness of the grapes playing with the flavor of the kale. Yum! The guacamole and cheese dips were good! There was so much dip! We were 3 hungry girls and we couldn't finish it all. The pizza was good, not great. The crust was tasty, but I didn't love the flavor of the toppings. It was very dry and I think the sauce was probably good, but there was so little sauce on it that it was difficult to taste it. It seemed more like super thin crust flat bread than pizza. It was good, but not amazing. I decided to buy some desserts and breads to try at home. I got a slice of key lime pie, peanut butter pie, and a fruit bar of some sort. The key lime pie didn't have that sharp tart feeling that I've come to know and love in key lime pie. The fruit bar was good, but I couldn't tell what kind of fruit it was. I gave the peanut butter pie to my husband, not sure if he's eaten it yet. I also got a pack of their English muffins. They are good, the flavor is nice but they are very oily on the outside.  Overall it was a good experience, I will for sure go there again and try other menu items!",

Not only is valet parking a turn off, but it is still not convenient here and the attendants are rather rude considering you are their customer. I have tried to visit at off times and the parking is always the gripe.   There's just something that goes against my grain to pay to go out to dinner only to be forced into paying for parking. I'm used to most places that if you spend say $25 or so, they offer free parking. Yes there is a small pick up free parking area, but it is always full and trust me I've tried for 20 minutes before to get parking there - not going to happen.   The pizza is delicious and probably my second favorite in the valley to Pizzeria Bianco. The appetizers are delicious and the little grocery and gift shop next door is fun.   I would come here a LOT more if they came up with a better parking solution, but every time I think of that parking lot.. my thoughts are.. I'll try somewhere new.   The pizza crust has a perfect texture, and is nearly a sourdough base. We tried The Fallen Angel which is out of this world - the housemade sausage makes it along with the shaved fennel.   We tried their Pizzeria Chop Salad which was out of this world, another dish I would order again. They also do an amazing grilled artichoke which is delightfully executed.   For dessert we headed on next door!",

A pepperoni pizza and a Cesar salad. However, if I would have known that the salads are made then put in plastic trays for anyone to grab I would have never ordered it. To make matters worse the salad had a strange taste to it. I don't know if it was the cheese or the dressing, but it was not good at all. Plus there were no croutons and that salad was $9! I would suggest you stay away from ordering the Cesar salad. As for the pizza is was truly nothing special. The cheese was slightly burned and truth be told Peter Piper Pizza has better tasting pizza. The only reason I am even giving two stars is because I love the ambience of LGO and the service is really nice. Plus it seemed that the sandwiches and desserts are the things to order so I would totally still give LGO another chance!",

    "text": "Stellar pizza. The good folk at La Grande Orange clearly know their stuff. The pizzas have well-thought out and executed topping combos. They use delightfully fresh toppings. And most of all, they've absolutely nailed the texture of their pizza: the crust stays perfectly crunchy (yet slightly soft inside) everywhere on the pizza, regardless of how many toppings you load on. Which, speaking of toppings, they allow you to add on extra garlic, onion, and even a fried egg with runny yolk for free--any pizza place that appreciates the magic of runny egg yolk and provides it for free is something special.   When I saw that they only offered a single variety of wing, I was somewhat nervous that it was an after thought--but I was dead wrong. Easily on par with their great pizza. Pleasantly spicy and ever so slightly sweet, their grilled wings are an excellent example of what hot wings are supposed to be.   Parking sucks, but oh well.",

    "text": "After a few pickup orders from here, this has become my go to spot for pizza in Phoenix area.  The establishment is part of a larger group of restaurants based out of Santa Monica, spearheaded by Bob Lynn, who is well known as the gentlemen who made Houston's chain the success that they are. The establishment is clearly ran like a business and that's not necessarily a bad thing, particularly given that the value for the buck that one gets here is quite impressive. A solid size pizza to feed two people for under $15 with some premium ingredients like avocados, basil, etc? That's quite impressive and Bob deserves a pat on the back just for pulling that off.  The style of pizza itself in my view is very California. The crust is much thicker and sturdier than that of a Neapolitan pizza, yet the ingredients and flavors are much lighter than most American style pizzas. Many many healthy options. I also liked the crunch on the edges, with some cheese baked in. Having tried numerous pizzas here, from Avocado, to mushroom and onion and even the meat pizza, I enjoyed all of them. They really are very good pizzas, loaded with toppings very generously.   The shop itself is cool, yet overpriced to a degree I can't even describe. I mean, really really overpriced. Some of the small juice bottles here sell for $10 that would sell for half of that at grocery stores. The honey comb is a whopping $24. Mexican chocolates for $5 a pop for a small piece. Hot sauces somewhere around $10. It's a cool concept and just as any business, it has to profitable, so the shop is clearly making some serious margins. I'd suggest sticking to the pizza here.",

But the grocery section should not be overlooked. The assortment of scarves and housewares and hipster sketchbooks and girly jewelry holders should not distract you....... From the WINE and the CHEESE! Oh my gosh. Grab some Edam and a bottle of Cannonball and call it a night. They really have some good vino and eats here for dinner making. Oh! And get some red velvet from the bakery case to go. Salivating now.   Thank goodness they finally setup an overflow parking lot.  Now you have no excuse not to come here.",

The house gelato was amazing!  Food: We loved the fermented sourdough crusts - they were something a little bit different, and added a kick to our pizzas. I especially liked the way the sourdough paired with the Mother Earth. We got the Mother Earth (as mentioned) with cheese (not vegan), the Mushroom Party, and the Fallen Angel. All three were really good - the Mother Earth was my favorite, while my husband liked the Fallen Angel. The Mother Earth was full of vegetables that are usually hard to find on pizza, such as broccolini, and the Fallen Angel was amazing, if you like fennel. The Mushroom Party was really good, too - it just seemed more like something you could find on a regular pizza menu. For dessert, we had gelato, which was SO good. They let us go next door to the little attached grocery so we could sample all the different flavors. All were good, and we ended up going with prickly pear, Meyer lemon, cherry amaretto, and pistachio (in different cups!).  Service: Our server was friendly and saved our seats while we ventured to the grocery store. We had to wait fifteen to twenty minutes for our friends to arrive, and she didn't seem annoyed that we were taking up one of her tables (we didn't know that they'd be that long). She was very good about answering our questions, and pizzas didn't take too long to come out. It was a little squishy at the table, and it didn't really seem like there was enough room for all the food and for us.",

Wile not right at our side the whole time I thought the service was pretty good, and pleasant.  I got a sample of my first choice of beer and glad I didn't go that route but the waitress listened to my comments and made a suggestion which was very good. I had a really good tasting cheeseburger with a side salad. Two of our party shared a pizza and I didn't hear any complaints.",

    "text": "Let's make this clear up front. I wanted to LOVE it. I really, really did. We live close by and have always heard LGO is the best neighborhood spot in Arcadia.. so tonight we decided this was the night to try it. Maybe it was an off night? Let's start by saying parking to pick up is a beast. The hubby didn't want to wait in the 8 car deep parking lot line so he parked nearby and hoofed it. Hey, being that busy is a GREAT sign! When he tried to pick up there was confusion about which computer our order was on.. which seemed odd.. but it was found, paid, and he was on his way. We ordered an Avacado Pizza with prosciutto and a Ceaser salad. When I saw the Ceaser I was instantly disappointed in the quality of the romaine and the size of my 8$ salad. There was a thin layer of romaine, most of which had gotten wilted and the orange tint from having been cut and put in the box a while ago. The croutons were soft- not sure if that was intentional but I love crisp croutons and that further disappointed. The pizza was good, nice crust, nice toppings and met expectation- but wasn't so unbelievably good (or such a good value) that I can't wait to go back.   Edited to add: Just a few minutes after posting my review we received a phone call from a manager at LGO.  The manager, Kathy, was on the phone apologizing for the less than stellar experience. She explained that she checked the remaining Ceaser salads and trashed them and offered us a replacement. That made a huge impression on my husband and myself- I appreciate they took the time to immediately correct the problem and reach out to us. She went above and beyond to correct the situation which in my book gets them another star. It says a lot about who you are and what you stand for when there is a problem and it is handled in this way. You've earned our future visit!",

To drink, I would get the sangria, its one of my to go drinks when I visit LGO. Also if you are planning to come here for lunch, they have tons of pick up and go options. If you are planning to do dinner here, make sure you show up early as it gets packed.",

The appetizers were really good as well, I had the chips and dip tray (oh my god the pimento cheese dip) and their take on insulata caprese.  The tomatoes were roasted and amazing, one of the best capreses I've ever had.    They are a little on the pricey side, but totally worth it for what you get.  I probably wouldn't take younger kids here but it's a great place for a date night.    Complimentary valet parking was pretty sweet, too, just make sure you have a couple bucks cash to toss the valet.",

Specifically the roasted corn and goat cheese pizza at La Grande Orange Pizzeria which has to be near the top of the list for all the great pizzas the two us who contributed to this review have consumed.  And that is a lot of pizza.  We were visiting Scottsdale as tourists when the concierge at the resort recommended this place to us.  Bless her.  Very convenient too to be able to shop for wine at La Grande Orange grocery, adjoining, and other goodies while we waited on our take out pizza order.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix#hrid:4cXbhzxxtmExF9kRjmFViQ/src:self\">yelp.com/biz/la-grande-o...</a>  The only hitch here is parking is terrible during peak hours. So it goes.  The pizza is worth the parking hassle.  We're on our way back to Scottsdale in a few days for another visit and La Grande Orange Pizzeria is on our \"go\" list again. The Rocket Man pizza is calling our name this time.",

She got me excited over absolutely every bit of the menu, my date was lucky I didn't order one of everything. We got a bottle of wine, the gluten free chips and dip (with pimento, guacamole and salsa) and since my dinner partner is now gluten and dairy free, he refused to split a pizza. I was told the sourdough crust is a must, so I got the margherita pizza with artichokes added while he got the Rocket Man with their gluten free crust and goat cheese (because that's still allowed!)           At the end, I couldn't find any more room to eat--I didn't even make it through three pieces of my amazing pizza, but when she started her passionate schpeel on dessert-- I couldn't say no. So he tried the strawberry sorbet and I got the salted caramel gelato. She even brought us a scoop of raspberry sorbet to try on the house.   I'm obsessed. Please just make me all of my meals.",

I was immediately tempted by the \"buy the bottle retail and we don't charge you a corkage fee\" and opted for the MollyDooker Boxer, which I don't see that often, but is quite tasty.  Also helps that they can recork and let you take it with you so that you can optimize your cost and your wine experience by choosing the best by the bottle.  For the meal, we split the apple manchego salad and the avocado pizza with prosciutto.  The salad was fresh and tasty and had the right ratio of spinach to toppings, though was a little heavy on the dressing.  The pizza crust was very crisp (in a good way) which was the perfect offset to the smooth texture of the avocado.  Kate said that she was worried that the whole thing would be mushy in the mouth with the avocado but that she was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked with the crispy crust.  For dessert, we of course opted for the gelato.  The feature flavor was lavender-pomegranate-rosewater, and was a heavenly aromatic concoction.  We only got singles, and I don't think I could have handled more than that because it was quite flavorful.    Sure, the parking is limited, but the valet next door is free as long as you validate.  Hope that I get some more trips to Phoenix in the future so that we can go back and try some of the stuff from the cute grocery!",

I've had many-a-good-pizza in my day, and been to some places that I thought were my favorites, until I had this little joint 7 years ago when they first opened.  His first year, the owner did $1M in food cost, because he really cares about the ingredients and the items they use.  It's all extremely high quality products.  They buy and import huge $500 wheels of Reggiano Parmesan cheese that the servers will put on some of your pizza if you so wish.  Everything about this really modern place screams quality.  The Gladiator is my favorite, which is Pepperoni and Sausage, and consists of this locally made Sausage called \"Schreiners Sausage.\"  Some of the best Ive ever had.  Fennel gives it a great little kick, and is extremely cravable.    The Shrimp Ceviche is absolutely amazing.  Flavorful, and tasty and I don't even like avocado, but for some reason this I can eat.  Then, when finished you've GOT to go next door to the Market, and get a few \"Ooey Gooey\" Cupcakes made by a talented woman named Tammie Coe who does excellent cakes and other droolable sweet baked goods.  This is in my opinion, the best Pizza you will find in the valley.  Look at all the 4 and 5 star reviews.  I'm not the only one that thinks so ;)",

Don't think you will find a parking spot. There is valet available in the evening but not for lunch. Plus, then you have to pay for parking (ie. tip the valet).

The parking is cramped and the ordering process for breakfast or lunch can be totally chaotic but it is solid every time I go.  They chilaquiles are to die for!    The pizza is solid and the menu has a lot of unique toppings but it is waaaay overpriced.  The pizzas are very small but yet cost close to $20 if you add a few toppings.  You can go to any place in town (Bianco, Cibo, Grimaldis) and get more food for equal or less money.  There are too many options for pizza in the Phoenix area to settle on LGO.",

Its versatility gives you the leeway to combine interesting new ingredients, change the flavor and thickness of the crust, dress it up, or just keep it simple. I could eat pizza for every meal of the day - and have!  The pizza at LGO is really just what I needed this week.   LGO is fantastic. Their pizzas are very nicely done. They have really tasty combinations, like the fallen angel with local Schreiner's sausage, peppers, and fennel (fave!) or the rocket man with chiles and broccolini. The crust has a good flavor, and is thin and crisp. The servers are great, and the decor is fun and comfy- love the flowers. I've always wanted to try the wings, but am a sucker for the pizza.   When I come to LGO, my favorite thing to do is order my pizza at the LGO Grocery, shop around the fun selection of wines, pastas, cheeses, plants, novelties, and pastries, and then eat on the patio, or even in the back of the store. A very friendly ambiance, and otherwise a really great menu. Best yet, you can pick out a tasty treat for dessert, grab a bottle of wine and make yourself a nice little meal. The pizza at LGO is good, so go try it!",

    "text": "I have been to this restaurant 4 times & I have enjoyed every experience. I have been a patron when I was vegetarian and while currently vegan. I look for vegetarian/vegan options and ability for the restaurant to be accommodating if it isn't immediately obvious on their menu, but, it is obvious that this restaurant is accommodating in being veg-friendly, so it was not an issue.  I've had pizzas and salad during my visits. Both were delicious. I was really happy to see they are also providing gluten-free options too. It was hard not to eat the meal in its entirety, even though I was probably full half-way through, every time. Menu items, particularly the pizzas are easy to customize, if desired. The mozzarella is delicious, the red sauce is not too sweet or tangy. Overall, just a good balance of flavors going on with all their pizzas.   The service was great too. Every time, the servers were nice, friendly, and helpful, especially when I voiced my dietary requirements.   The little grocery and espresso bar are great too! The coffee is actually good and the artisan goods in the grocery are fun and tasty, with some good food novelties as well.  Overall ,this place is charming, not too pricey, casual, but nice atmosphere. I would recommend it to anyone, meat-eaters alike.",

    "text": "Well finally! Just over a year ago Gabi invited me to lunch at LGO, then we switched and went somewhere else and that is the last time I have been on the verge of going there. Not that EVERYONE didn't recommend it. When people hear where I live they assume I'm making daily trips to LGO, which I now know, I should have been!   Dottsy and I hit up LGO on Wednesday night, meeting at 7:30. Of course the place was packed, not to mention the absurd parking lot (thank god I rode my bike!), but the LGO gods smiled on me and I found two seats at the chef's table almost immediately. I took in the menu as I waited for Dottsy (late as always, but I forgive you), though honestly there's not a lot to take in as the options are few and very straightforward. Then I stared at other people's food and got really excited. So excited that it took me forever to figure out what I wanted to eat (Shrimp Ceviche, Pizzeria Chop Salad, Mushroom Party Pizza or Veg-o-rama pizza were the final four).   Dottsy bought us some time by telling the server he was both 'GORGEOUS!' and had 'BEAUTIFUL EYES.' Way to take one for the team Dottsy. I went for the Pizzeria Chop Salad and the Butternut Squash Soup to start.  My soup was decent, but really, I need to stop ordering things I make really well at home because I'm never wowed. Anyway, the salad was yummy and I'd asked for no raisins and our server even came by to make sure it was raisin-free (it was, and btw he really was beautiful).  Dottsy's pizza looked great and I got to sample a slice and immediately wanted a whole pie to myself.   I guess it's all the more reason to head back to LGO and work through the rest of the menu!",

Being that this is my first review I just want to let you know that I do not intend to score easy on restaurants, this just happens to be a favorite of mine. So here it goes....  Ever have a day that just seems gloomy, depressing, boring, unfulfilled. Well, the common cure I have found isn't at the pharmacist or the doctor. No, the cure I found happened to be just around the corner at a little pizzeria called, well, pizzeria. This magnificent little joint is attached to the hip of what is known as La Grande Orange grocer. I have to say nothing brings a smile to my face faster than fresh shrimp ceviche followed by sweet corn pizza with sourdough crust and a pitcher of house made white sangria. My wife and I frequent this establishment and have never once left with bad taste. Service has always been exceptional even when the place is slammed with customers. I warn you though, eat all you want but do save room for a slice of peanut butter pie.  I believe the only thing that I've ever had problems with is some of the rude customers, but it's typical behavior of the residents of the area.",

You are the perfect place to go on a date, with a friend, with my family, with a group, by myself, with work associates, etc.   There is a bit of a wait if you go during peak times; however it is worth it.   The caprice salad, when they have it, is INCREDIBLE. Do not pass that up if your server mentions it. On a budget? Pick up a bottle in the store (prices do start around $9.99) and they'll open it for you to enjoy at dinner (or before dinner if you are waiting.)  The pizzas may sound kind of funky if you are new to the joint, but don't fear. They know what they are doing.",

I've always enjoyed their variety of menu options, and find it a good place to take people for a quick and easy breakfast/lunch option.  The food is reasonably priced, with the exception of their beautiful and creative Tammie Coe cakes with are crazy expensive.  The market aspect of LGO gives you something to do while you wait for your food to arrive at the counter.  My favorites are any of their lunch sandwiches.  And my friend loves their egg sandwiches so much he texts me to remind me how good they are.  This LGO is too adorable for words, and is hands down the better than their Pasadena location.",

    "text": "My favorite pizza in the Valley. Hands down. (Sourdough crust, YUM.)  But... there are a few precautions to consider.   1. Price is a bit high especially considering the portions and atmosphere, but I believe the quality is worth it.   2. When busy, it gets a bit chaotic which causes discomfort for newbies. They are setup as a market/restaurant and serve pizza on the weekends and after 4pm during the week. I recommend a later dinner during the week with the understanding that you may need to wait. The dining is cozy and unique, but it can get a bit loud.   3. The service is pretty laid back and generally very kind, but their casual nature can be taken as lack of attention.   All of these things in consideration, they are great at what they do and cater to the locals that can appreciate it. If expect a structured, chain-restaurant, cookie-cutter style experience, this is not the place.  They are unique, quaint and make delicious pizza. (Wings are fabulous as well). I have been going here for years, and can't get enough.  My Recommended Dinner for Two:  Appetizer: 6 wings ( Warning: They are spicy)  Pizza: Margherita add Red Sauce and Pepperoni  Dessert: Slice of Red Velvet Cake",

When in town my sister recommended popping in with my mom for a quick bite. I was very impressed! We waited for about 10 minutes for a table, which went by fairly quickly since we browsed in the shop next store.  We debated on buying a bottle of wine to share for our meal (which is such a great deal since they don't charge a corking fee). We decided on margaritas instead. We ordered the pitcher, which is $25, but if you divide by the amount of drinks you get, it's a steal! We had the shrimp ceviche, which was amazing! We decided on a custom made pizza with all the fixing! The pizza had the best crust I've ever had in my life! Overall, the experience was awesome. I will for sure be coming back to LGO my next trip to P-town!!",

Then they stick it back in the oven and let it cook for a few minutes. This time they cooked it in a skillet and put it on top of the pizza. It wasn't the same as baking it right onto the pizza.

My favorite is the Avocado Pizza ($14) and I like to add prosciutto ($3) to it for a little extra flavor. It's thin crust, no sauce and made with asiago cheese(yummm) It's a good size to eat by yourself if you want to take some home, or it's perfect to share for two people. They also have great specials on pitchers of sangria and some sort of vodka lemonade from what I remember.   Be sure to check out their grocery area and the gelato shop next door as well. I'd suggest to call ahead and make reservations since it's usually pretty crowded after 5 or 6pm.",

Parking still sucked though.  I got my usual.  The green chili burger without the bun but instead of fries I got the Caesar.  The salad was just eh and I should have ordered the corn instead.

Our waiter wasn't very attentive and 2 out of the 5 orders were screwed up.  The manager came by to say sorry and said the 2 meals were comped.  That was nice.  The waiter also gave us a piece of the red velvet cake which was also very nice because the red velvet cake is excellent and some of the best around.  ** Update 5/16/10 **  I received a \"compliment\" about my review above.  It said, \"F*ck you douche bag\".  Not sure who it was but I politely said I don't swing that way and thanks for the offer.

The vibe is loud music, colorful decor and lots of people waiting in line. Sometimes the service is slow or a bit 'french' because of the volume of people, but the food makes up for it. You can't go wrong with about anything there, but if you want to try something different try their cerviche.  Now what is it ? Ceviche is traditionally a South American dish made by marinating pieces of fish or shellfish in citrus juice. Their version is the best I have ever had, it very fresh, bursting with lime, shrimp and healthy vegtables. It's a great way to start a dinner and don't forget to have a sangria along with it.",

I've had LGO Pizzeria on my radar for a couple of years. Everyone would rave about how delicious the food is but I never checked it out because of the crazy parking situation. I was hungry after seeing a movie at the Esplanade and for some reason my intuition told me to go to LGO! I got there an hour before they closed and it wasn't busy at all.  I ordered the baked chicken wings for my boyfriend and a gladiator pizza for me. The waiter described the wings as smokey with a slight barbeque flavor. I'm not a fan of chicken wings but I could eat these wings all day. On to the pizza.....Probably the best pizza I've ever had. The crust, the sauce, and all the ingredients were top notch. I was in heaven.   I am so happy I finally made it to LGO Pizzeria. I understand what all the hype is about. There is something so special about this place I can't describe it. I want to move down the street so I can stop by everyday!",

LGO's also taught me a valuable lesson. Sometimes, the best pizzas aren't the meat-lovers ones but the VEGETARIAN options. What?! I know, I had to swallow a lot of pride to accept that but it is truth!  My Fallen Angel pizza with its yummy sausage just paled in comparison to my companions' vegetarian orders. The Mother Earth pizza is rife with just awesome vegetable ingredients and flavors. It was like a beautiful medley of music when I bit into a slice of that!

    "text": "There's just something about La Grande Orange Pizzeria.  No matter the valet, which is almost as annoying as a parking meter or garage. Now we have to pay a cover charge (as in, the tip to the valet), just to eat at your restaurant.  No matter the cramped quarters in the Grocery area, which is a major cluster during lunch time and horrible for claustrophobic people. The concept of a conjoined restaurant and market is so neat (see Olive + Ivy), but if it's disorganized, could fail miserably.  And no matter the single stall bathroom in a huge restaurant, or the fact you might have to wait over an hour for a table on a Friday night. The place's popularity was as strong as ever when I went there for dinner.  I've always enjoyed La Grande Orange's pizza, which, along with its extensive wine list, is one of its specialties.  This time around, my olive and avocado pizza ($17) was crispier than I prefer, but it was still really tasty-I ate a whole one myself, even though it serves two people! Still, I could name three spots quickly whose pizza I prefer over La Grande Orange.  I do also appreciate La Grande Orange for its open kitchen, though, which is always neat to see in a restaurant.  There were a couple things about the eatery that irk me, though, and make me feel like the spot is way overrated.  First, our party of 10 waited more than an hour to be sat, which was understandable because the place doesn't take reservations, but they really should for large parties since in other ways it's family-friendly-there were lots of screaming kids running around before we sat down. The restaurant was nice enough to serve us a pizza while we were waiting, though, which was unexpected and made the wait bearable-despite the fact there was no waiting area.  Yes, that's right-if you're waiting for a table (and you usually will), there is no designated waiting spot-you just sort of hover over other tables, which would be really awkward and annoying if I was sitting there.  When we were seated, though, the set-up was bizarre. Instead of putting us up in a big booth or pushing tables together, we were in a spot where separate tables were bolted to the ground, so our party wasn't even technically sitting together-we were at different spots.  For a place that isn't even that pretty or romantic or modern or stylish, I'm puzzled by its popularity, because I've had better pizza at countless places and have dined at spots with more attractive ambiance-all for far better deals. It must be the Arcadia neighborhood vortex that just draws people in, but I wish La Grande Orange was run more efficiently. Especially because it seems none of my friends have realized yet how not phenomenal it is, and I will accompany them again some time.",

    "text": "See the blog for photos and the review of La Grande Orange Grocery for my thoughts on myriad other items from La Grande Orange group.  This one is specific to the menu items within the Pizzeria and will be updated as I try more.  All things being equal, I love this place.  Baked Chicken Wings with Point Reyes Blue Cheese:  From the \"LGO Pizzeria\" menu that begins service at 4pm on weekdays and 11am on weekends it'd be hard for me to imagine a better way to watch football in a public space than at La Grande Orange.  Not a fan of bars, beers, or greasy bites LGO offers up a tasteful menu of traditional American gameday fare highlighted by these $1/ea. seared, seasoned, baked to order wings.  Featuring organic chicken, plenty of heat, and just a bit of char what really sets these wings apart is how plump and juicy they remain even without frying and also the dressing - a sort of \"ranch\" with subtle sourness, lots of chives, and big chunks of bleu cheese throughout.  LGO Pizzeria Pizza - Half Classic Margherita and Half Roasted Corn with Laura Chenel Goat Cheese, Corn, roasted tomatoes, and basil:  An interesting pie to say the least, what strikes me most about LGO's pizza is the crust - a sort of sourdough starter that the team is making when the place opens at 6:30am and allowing to rise on the counter as lunch/dinner approaches.  Topped with the superior ingredients that LGO is well known for and slathered with a lot of quality olive oil plus a bit of butter the crust gets a great crunch without getting much char and although the oven isn't hot enough to generate the same blister as Bianco or Pomo (particularly as the bakers are opening/closing it frequently to put new pizzas in and take finished ones out) the structure remains supple with a great chew.  Much more willing to go half/half than the vast majority of high end pizzerias these days I found the Margherita as good as the ingredients, though they went a bit light on the tomatoes for my tastes while the Roasted corn was excellent, the smoky sweetness of the corn proving a perfect foil to the punchy chevre.",

It's bustling and everyone is happy, and everyone is drooling over the food and baked goods coming out of the kitchen.  I can't believe it's taken me this long to get in here, I'll definitely be a regular from now on.  I ordered the Venice Beach burrito and it was sooooo tasty, we also decided to crack a bottle of champagne to celebrate the momentous occasion of experiencing this place.  The main room where you order at the counter has a staggering array of candy, gifts, baked goods, prepared meals, magazines, etc. etc. etc.  It'll take you a day just to look at it all.  Maybe next time I go back I can get my christmas shopping done while waiting in line.  The only things I would change about this place would be: I'd add table service and increase portions.  I'd also make the dining room feel a little more like the room where you order...it's just a little more inviting and comfortable.  Other than that, it was yummy and fun to eat here.

Those damned cupcakes that look just like classic Hostess cupcakes. All the cute merchandise in front that makes me want to spend ridiculous amounts of money on overpriced crap I don't need. Don't love: The $6 teeny tiny cappuccino. The parking situation. Otherwise, keep it up.",

Well a year and a half later - it is still my go to. The pizzas are made with a sour dough crust, and the freshest ingredients.. The corn is fresh, goat cheese, basil, mozzarella and I add avocado to the top.   I usually order from the grocery side and snag a bottle of wine too. I recently moved into Arcadia and have gotten to try their breakfast (love the oatmeal), salads and some of the fresh baked bread to take home.   Plus- you can pick up just about any little treasure Your heart desires. They have tons of books, candies, candles, home goods...the list goes on. This place is s gem and perfect for absolutely any type of mood you are in.",

    "text": "*Realized this got posted to their Bake Shop Yelp page instead, so posted here now.  LGO is what I believe to be one of Phoenix's coolest CONCEPTS. The execution of their plan, however is subpar. I understand it's supposed to be quaint and they've been in the same spot years and why they wouldn't expand so the rest of the people complaining about space should remember the kind of environment they're going for. However, given the fact that there is lack of space inside the restaurant and for parking, the \"servers\" should be a little more aware of their surroundings and to be be blunt, they should be a little more customer-service oriented. They are, for lack of a better term, rude. YOU WORK IN A RESTAURANT AND A BUSY ONE, PEOPLE ARE PAYING YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. So take a minute and slow down. The last time I was in there, two separate employees actually ran into me, when they could have avoided it by slowing down and looking where they were going. Not to mention, NEITHER of them said excuse me or apologized. They also don't make way for customers, instead, they just keep walking and allow the customers to make way for them.   These employees are so disorganized and frantic. So much so that even when I call in an order and come early and let them know I'm there, they still let my pizza sit and I still take home cold pizza.   Also last time I was in, I first went to the coffee bar to look at that menu and I'm aware that is not where you typically order or pick up. While I was at that station, I asked a girl who was organizing her book if they had matcha. She looked at me like I was inconveniencing her for asking that and confused, then said I don't think so and walked away. Then another employee walked up and said, and I quote, \"actually you don't order here, you can go over to where the line is,\" in a very rude manner.   I think the concept is great, it is overall very quaint and delicious when the employees don't let my food sit and get cold. Great environment, great music, valet & self-parking available, I have no problems with those things I have seen other complaints about. I do, however, have a problem with their employees being so rushed (I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE BUSY) and so rude. I hope that management sees this and really considers hiring some people that can handle themselves under stress, are more aware of their surroundings and are more friendly.",

The peanut butter chocolate chip had huge depth of flavor and the largest chips I have witnessed ever lurking throughout the dessert. The mango flavor also was intense as gelato allows a more pure taste experience. The BBQ chicken sandwich at $8.75 was packed with chicken breast (with skin) and cole slaw, but the flimsy hamburger bun was not a worthy piece of bread for this sandwich (perhaps a hero?). It must have been the holiday because I got a parking spot right away. See you next New Year's day.",

Having eaten at the nearby Ingo's Tasty Food I had high hopes for the pizza here and my takeout Mushroom Party didn't disappoint. Loaded with mushrooms, garlic, and sweet onions it was a white pizza that had an abundance of veggies and flavor without being too heavy. One minor thing to nitpick was the crust of the pizza which was a tad too chewy.  My friend, who ordered the Gladiator, wasn't a big of fan of his pizza as the meat pizza with sausages and pepperoni looked a bit undertopped. The sausage while good was the only noticeable topping on the pizza.  I definitely want to come back and check out the other offerings that La Grande Orange serves up. They also have an airport location so I'm looking to try out the sandwiches and breakfast items there as well.   As for the pizza it satisfied my cravings but I probably won't rush back due to the fact that its a bit pricey and wasn't blown away. ($32 for 2 pies) It's a solid product but can't compete to the artisan pizza that places like Pizetta 211 turns out in the outer boroughs of SF.",

The heard what I had to say and acknowledged the important of reviews and making sure their customers are happy. I am taking them from 2 stars to 5 for multiple reasons.  1.They contacted me within 45 mins. 2.They treated my review as important as it was their first.  3.They described what course of action was going to be taken. 4.They asked if I would please come back in and not let 1 bad experience ruin a long relationship.  They did everything they could do to correct a an issue and shouldn't be penalized.   Thank you LGO for taking care of business.  First Review (Below)  I have been here multiple times before but this time really bothered me. The music was loud which wasn't a huge deal but the fact that the pizza guy kept throwing the empty pizza trays on to the floor in an extremely loud, startling manner made dinner unbearable.  Every minute you would hear a crashing of empty tray on empty tray.  Very disappointed.  I used to eat here almost daily. I will come back again and hope it's a one off but it was by far one of the worst experiences I have had at a restaurant.",

The pizza is incredible.  Most great pizza comes from a brick oven but not here.  They cook in pretty standard equipment but their ingredients and quailty are outstanding.

If you are from out of town and searching Yelp for the best pizza from the plethora of pizza places (what is up with all the pizza here?) in the area, search no more.  Trust me.  My wife and I went to all the places including the coveted Pizzeria Bianco; Base Pizza (awesome view); and Federal Pizza.  We tried chains like Grimaldi's Pizza (surprisingly good!), too.  In addition, we tried the pizza at the hot and new Mora Italian (not worth it and the pizza was subpar) and other local places like Wink 24 (pizza was paper thin, get lasagna).  None of them compare to La Grande Orange Pizzeria.  Their cheese, which they make, is extremely favorable.  It reminds me of the cheese on pizza when I was kid.  Whatever they do, it is perfect.  The sauce is perfect, too.  My wife ordered her standard; cheese and basil (but not a Margherita) and was delighted when it came out covered in basil.  Her pizza was green!  The basil was fresh and strong.  We are still talking about how much basil they gave.  I had a Gladiator pizza and added spicy Fresno chilis to one half and onions to the other.  It was out of this world.  If you are wondering, I liked the onion side better.  The homemade sausage on the pie was a culinary treat.  Other items we tried included the Shredded Kale Salad & Quinoa and the Chips and Dips Plate.  Like the pizza, the salad was excellent.  The chips and dips were good, too.  I was very curios, but was not able to find out about their salsa.  It was probably the best salsa I've had.  Their guacamole was a bit plain for me, but the house-made pimento cheddar dip was a treat.  Our server was a bit spacey, but overall the service was great.  We appreciated that you could walk next door to their market and buy a bottle of wine.  They waive the corkage fee.  It is the way to go if your table plans to have more than a couple glasses of wine.  When in Phoenix, this is the place!",

The food is always fantastic, my dad loves hanging out while waiting for it (I'm not sure how much they like it, but it seems like he makes buddies), and I literally cannot think of one time in years that they have ever disappointed me. Every time my mom gets bored and switches us to a new place, we always come back. No substitution for LGO.  Get what sounds good to you, and you will enjoy it. It's as simple as that. I've had everything on the menu and no complaints with anything. They don't have my favorite pizza anymore (RIP), I think it was called the Padre, but they've actually been nice enough to make it for me a few times. Our go to pizza is the Gladiator. The avocado with prosciutto is always great too. Their sausage is fantastic.  This review is short on specific details, I know. But if there was ever a review for you to listen to, it would be this one. La Grande Orange Pizzeria has been a part of my life since I was a teenager, and I hope they stick around forever.  (OK if I had to say ONE negative thing about LGO- they are very busy and parking is limited. I've only eaten inside a handful of times because we are more inclined to eat at home. The inside is beautiful but of course crowded and noisy when they are busy.)  I don't think Megan (sp?) still works there, but she was the best! My dad is a chatty old man and she handled him every Friday for years like a champ.   If anyone knows us... hi from Harry's daughter! We love LGO!",

Buttery, crisp on the outside, soft chewy on the inside, flaky, perfect fermented bubbles inside with a hint of sourness.  I tried their veggie \"Mother Earth\" pizza. As hearty as it sounds, the pizza was loaded with fresh veggie toppings tendered beautifully in the magical oven. The pizza sauce harmoniously balances the fresh mozzarella cheese and the toppings, and its flavor is not over-powering. I wished the pizza had more creaminess from the cheese/had more cheese.  Also, their bakery menu is mouthwatering. What's specifically impressive is that they mention the time each bakery item was last baked to indicate freshness of the product.  Highly recommend this place and can't wait to dash there soon!  Ideally, I suggest you to hike up Camelback mountain and head to LGO for brunch. You'll definitely feel rewarded !",

The ambiance is great (we were seated right away during a busy weeknight happy hour), and though it's packed and loud, you can comfortably converse with your party. The only reason it's not a 5 for me is because of our server - she barely checked in on us and we had to wave her down to order, and again for the check.   But on to the food...amazing!!! One of the best pizzas I've ever had - they use a distinct sour dough (not sure if that's actually what it is, but that's what it tastes like) crust that's right in-between crunchy flat crust and fluffy regular pizza. The toppings are fresh, and LGO offers an outrageous selection of really great specialties with amazing topping pairings!   They also have alcoholic kombucha at the bar, which is super cool - I had a Kombucha mule and it was great. Will definitely be back here!",

My husband and I split two pizzas and it was a disappointment. I probably should've known better to not get pizza here. I'm a big Neapolitan gal and this is just regular ole pizza. The sourdough crust had a good flavor if you're into that, but I prefer a softer crust, fresh mozzarella, etc. if you're looking for good pizza specifically (which I was) I'd head to Cibo downtown.   I'd like to return and check out the gift shop and ice cream next door!

Known for their pizza of course I got a veggie pizza, made vegan.  They have a huge selection of vegetarian pizzas including vegan pizzas with vegan cheese!!!!!!!!!! Yes you read that right vegan cheese, and it is super tasty vegan cheese.   The have a happy hour cocktail menu that is a super great deal, 5 bucks a drink, from 4-6 PM I believe it is.   For  starters we had the chips with guacamole and pimento cheese, I didn't have the cheese dip because it wasn't vegan. But it did try the salsas that came with the appetizer and they all were loaded with flavor! The chips were super crunchy which was a plus.   I ordered the Mother Earth with no cheese (making it vegan) and it was wonderful! It was packed with a huge amount of veggies! I would have wished it would have been recommended to put vegan cheese on it because that would have made it even better.   The service was great and as always it was really busy. We got there just in time to avoid waiting long but weren't able to park in the front because all the spots were taken. However they have plenty of parking spots in the rear of the store with valet parking.   I highly recommend you walk through the LGO Grocery store connected to the restaurant. There are a lot of unique gifts, home goods, a to go deli to order from, and dessert!!! See some of the snaps I took below.   And guess what?! There are vegan desserts. They had a vegan apple cookie, which I had to try, and I was mind blown by how moist the cookie was. It also wasn't too sweet which made me happy.",

My sister and I split the chop salad. It was delicious. The ingredients worked so well together - I especially loved the sun dried tomatoes (they were seasoned perfectly. I could eat the tomatoes itself all day). The italian vinaigrette was light but tasty. For the pizza, we ordered half avocado pizza and half The Fallen Angel. The avocado pizza was good and has a strong lemon zest taste to it. It would have been way better with prosciutto (plus $3). My sister and I preferred the other half. The homemade sausage was delicious, along with the roasted peppers. The pizza dough itself is phenomenal, especially when it gets crispy in the ends.   There is definitely multiple reasons why LGO is so popular and high rated. It lives up to the hype. I will definitely be back!",

The only reason this was not 5 stars was because we went on a Saturday at 6pm and the place was packed.  We had to wait 25 minutes before getting a table for 6.  Also, the parking was full, which added to the wait time.  There is a valet attendant, who was a bit helpful.  Now, onto the food!  We stared with the baked chicken wings and it tasted hot and fresh.  It came with a fair amount veggies (celery sticks and blueberries) as well.  We ordered the Mushroom Party w/ chicken sausage, Classic Margherita, and Mother Earth.  Mushroom Party was just okay.  I love mushrooms, but the flavors didn't grab my taste buds as the other two did.  Classic Margherita was my favorite.  The tomatoes and their sauce was a great fusion of flavors despite not having any meat.  Hint: use the parmesan to enhance the cheese flavor even more.  The Mother Earth was also tasteful if you are a fan of broccoli and olives.  One of us had a cheese allergy, so we had this one without cheese and it still tasted great.  We shared the the Duvel Golden Ale growler which was much cheaper than each of us ordering an individual pint.  It was enough for about 5 and a half glasses.  So, 16 bucks vs 6 bucks a pint.  Which would you prefer?  Overall, great atmosphere and would recommend you give it a try.  Service was attentive with drinks and boxes despite the large crowd and customers were not to rowdy or out of control.  This place works for both social or family outings.",

Their pizzas are phenomenal, the appetizers are great, the wait staff is very helpful, and the ambiance is great.  After looking at my budget, I noticed that my only expense for the last two months in my restaurants category is LGO.  Seriously, go there, order the artichoke appetizer, iced tea, a margarita pizza, and gelato to finish it off. Amazing!",

I am quite curious if she is still working there. The food and service are typically great so hoping they just start hiring more professional hosts. After writing a negative review here originally, just know you might get privately messaged by an angry staff member. After the situation I have gone in to LGO and this time avoiding their host staff by sitting at a high top on the bar area. The servers were really nice and the food was tasty.",

Not when you ordered, not when you picked up your food, or your coffee. It felt like a tense environment up until I sat down to eat in the other room.  I love all the books, candles, and random stuff they have for sale, in addition to the delicious baked goods from Tammie Coe next-door.   Free valet, too!",

We went on a Sunday morning around 11 and it was craaazy busy as we expected. It took about 30 minutes to go through the line and then find a table for 2. I love that you can buy bottles of alcohol here! I found one of my favorite drinks in the fridge, Framboise sparkling lambic beer. I always get The Commuter w/ Avocado. Their rustic breads are great, the English muffins are buttery and delicious. They sell Tammy Coe baked goods and if you know anything about her, you know that her baking is the bomb. I have never had a more flavorful and moist blueberry muffin in my life. I love the curbside service for to-go orders. The iced honey latte is yummy.",

Ordered a pair of what are essentially $9 Egg McMuffins, and after waiting 10 minutes, they came out tepid to cold. The English muffin wasn't toasted, the eggs were cool, cheese was downright cold, and the bacon was barely warm. I returned my pair of sandwiches, specifically stating that they were cold and I would like them heated. They brought out two freshly prepared sandwiches, no questions asked (hence the 2 stars for good customer service) but they were just as bad as the first time. McDonald's manages a warm sandwich at a third of the cost, so I don't think it's much too expect. Anyways, won't be coming back.",

Beyond the entire LGO experience, the Pizzeria's pies are astounding. They may not be Bianco level, but the sourdough crust is enough to set them apart and wait is rarely more than 10 minutes, even with pickup. We particularly love the roasted corn and goat cheese pizza (add Italian sausage for richer flavor). The burgers are amazing, too. Some of the best in the city.  Oh, and the white sangria. Get that. Beer-wise, the selection is limited.  Service is typically excellent, though sometimes there's a wait for a table. I recommend getting there sooner rather than later so you can find a seat and the buzz from the sangria can last the rest of the evening.",

We decided to share the \"Gladiator\" (we added prosciutto, spicy Fresno peppers and garlic) our jaws dropped when our food arrived. It was seriously the best pizza we've ever had in our entire lives! The flavors were incredible and you could tell how fresh all of the ingredients were. We were so tempted to order a second pizza after we finished the first.

It's a bit overwhelming on your first visit, trying to figure out where to go for what, and it gets a bit crowded and hectic. I sort of just picked a line and lucked upon the right one.  I got the Spicy Chickpea Lettuce Wraps, which you can order from the menu or pick up from their grab-and-go cold case, which is what I did. (Cuts down on wait time.) Comes with 2 large iceberg lettuce cuffs, topped with their spicy chickpeas and avocado slices. These lettuce wraps are SO yummy and perfectly spicy. Mine came with a fresh pineapple wedge; perfect for cleansing the palate. A nice, light, healthy, and filling option.  There was a large dessert case, but there was only 1 vegan option: an apple pie cookie. I started to pass (I had my heart set on a cupcake), but an employee convinced me to try one. Great suggestion! It was one of the most delicious cookies that I have ever tasted. It was perfectly soft and chewy. An amazing treat! (I returned the very next day for more apple pie cookies!)  The items in the grab-n-go section are labeled with the ingredients, so you can see if the item is vegan or allergen-free without having to search for it on the overhead board.  The parking situation is pretty insane. They do offer complimentary valet parking (which I did not want to do), and there is another spill-over lot about a block north of the building for those who don't mind a short walk.",

They are baked and not deep fried which made the taste that much better. The sauce they use isn't your average buffalo sauce. It has a little bit of a sweetness to it which was really good.

It was our first time here and we had to valet our car because there was no room in the parking lot. We didn't mind because it was free, just had to tip of course.   Very cool gift shop and coffeeshop attached the main dining room with tons of eclectic gifts and food items not to mention fresh cheeses and wine. They even had a takeout counter with fresh sandwiches and pizza if you didnt have time to sit down and eat.   We sat down after a short wait and ordered some beers and water. There was a table that sat after us nearby that got their waters before we did, not a good start. Our beers arrived and still no water, we flagged down a random waiter and finally got some waters and our waitress came back a few minutes later to take our order.  Pizza arrived and looked good for the most part, but when we picked up a slice it was drenched in oil but we  decided to give it  a try regardless.Ughh, no seasoning, barely any tomato sauce and soggy crust.  It was just not edible for our taste. We complained and they were very polite about taking it back and taking it off the bill for us. They even sent the chef out and he explained to us that its very oily because they put oil in the dough and more oil on the sheet pan. He also explained that their style of pizza does not have much tomato sauce and they don't season their toppings. He said that their pizza is not for everyone but thats what makes it unique.   I can respect that and I appreciate them not charging us and coming out to see if there was anything they could do to make it better. We paid for our drinks and proceeded to go eat at my favorite pizza joint \"pomo pizzeria napoleatana\". Thats my kinda pizza.  Not hating on this place, I just prefer a seasoned, non greasy pizza from a brick oven with a crispy crust. Won't be coming back for their pizza, but their coffee with housemade nut milk I would get again and again, delicious!",

Each is handmade here on site.  Their Cinnamon morning bun is nothing like you have every had and melts in your mouth.  From the commuter breakfast sandwich to coffee, this place is the go to for food made fresh that never disappoints. The staff is friendly and always greets with a smile. The owner has a winner. Next time your in town or whether you live here.  Check this place out. Hats off the head pastry Chef named Cole. He's the best !",

The wings were ready quicker then the time we were told but we were stuck waiting on the chips for 10 minutes, what was frustrating was the fact that we could see it all sitting in the window. Once we got home we opened it all up to see a more than chunky guacamole. Which included the sticker of the avacado as well as the eye. Bland and unseasoned to say the least. Service and quality were poor.",

My visit started with my girlfriend and I not even being greeted/served water until 10 minutes had passed. After we finally had the opportunity to order our appetizer(chips and guac), we waited almost half an hour with out anyone assisting us or bringing us the extremely simple appetizer. Even after all the absurd waiting, my girlfriend and I decided to stick it out and order a pizza(fallen angel). I think you can guess what happened next. Our pizza took more than half an hour to come out and by that time it was pretty much cold. I am thoroughly disappointed with my experience here and would not recommend it to anyone as I would not want to put them through such a miserable time.",

    "text": "So, my only question for La Grande Orange Pizzeria is...can I please live here?  Seriously, this place is GREAT!  There really is no formal division between the pizzeria and grocery parts of the store, so I'm going to talk about both.  Grocery-wise, the place carries a broad mix of classic candies, wines, cookbooks, tchotchkes that rotate seasonally (I've picked up some great holiday items here in years past), and grocery staples; they also have a cafe that serves up oatmeal, eggs (friends rave about the Commuter Sandwich), salads, sandwiches, and sushi rolls.  Word to the wise - bring some extra napkins because their bakery will make you drool!  Order up front at the counter, pick a seat, and then keep your ears perked for when they call your name.  Friendly staff, cool ambience - I always find myself Shazam-ing the music here!  ;)           As far as the pizza is concerned, the crust is insane!  It almost reminds me of really good sourdough bread, toasted and crispy, not too thin and not too thick.  All the ingredients are fresh and the pizza permutations creative.  They serve up your pie on a slab of wood - nice presentation!  Sadly, I am a creature of habit - once I find something that's to my liking, I latch on and order it every time I return for the rest of my life :/ At this particular establishment, these personal faves would be the Rocket Man Pizza (spicy red fresno chilies, broccolini, roasted red peppers, roasted garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes) and the Classic Chocolate Pudding - wow, just wow!  I make my poor husband drive all the way across town to come here - he always grumbles but in the end, admits that the place IS pretty delicious.    The only negative - and it definitely a BIG negative - is the parking situation.  La Grande Orange has the tinsiest micro parking lot known to man.  On a good day if the parking lot gods are smiling down on you, you just might find an open 20 minute parking spot (I haven't been impressed that they actually enforce the time restrictions).  But, if you go on their website under the 'Secret Parking' link (shhhh!), you will find a diagram depicting other parking options that are slightly farther away.  So yeah, come check out La Grande Orange for some great pizza, brunch, baked goods, groceries...the list goes on.  One of my favorite places in Phoenix!",

You were really able to get the flavor of every topping. I especially loved loved all of the fresh basil on top and the tanginess of the sour dough crust. We also went to the bar and got the Saint Archer Hazy IPA, we even ended up getting a perfume from the fun and funky little retail store inside. Honestly what doesn't this place have!?

I dropped by La Grande Orange pretty early on a Saturday morning in my attempt to beat the crowds and still struggled a bit for parking. I was able to park behind the building because some kind soul was getting out just as I was frantically looking for parking. A lot of the spots at the front have time limits associated with them so not the place to park if you plan to stay and eat and wander.   There was a healthy line even on an early Saturday morning but we were able to order pretty quickly. We got the mushroom party pizza, grabbed a number, and were thankfully able to find a table to rest our butts while we waited. *The wait was a bit longer than we expected for food.* However, the taste more than made up for it! The pizza was delicious and I definitely devoured it at the speed of light. This is a great great place for a slice of pizza, but the crowds can be overwhelming -- which of course leads into trouble finding parking and the long waits for food.   Try to drop by during the lulls rather than during peak hours and you're sure to find a delicious slice of pizza followed by some stellar gelato.",

They are slightly spicy, a little tangy, sweet and crispy all in one! The pizza reminds me of a cross between Italian home cooking and NYC! Haha imagine!!! I have no idea what they do to their crust- but it is magical. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, hint of sweet and salty! I could go on forever! Fantastic wine!

Good food does NOT justify bad customer service or shotty consistency. The pros: LGO is clean, in a nice part of Phoenix, and has delicious pizzas. The cons: The pizza is often a giant cardboard box full of grease and cheese that has slidden off the pizza (still tasty, just sad. I even order extra crispy and still nothing) I've sat outside at curbside pickup for 20 minutes (not an exaggeration) before I had to cancel my order, and I've been spoken to rudely by a majority (not all) of the staff. I've been coming here for years and my friends are tired of hearing my complaining about LGO. Not a great way to treat a loyal customer. *The extra star was because when the pizza was good, it was really good.*",

Around 6 p.m. on a Friday night however, I got a spot with my friend right at the high-top. We had to sit next to each other since the table was so wide and long, but that is what everyone else was doing and it worked.  I got the \"fallen angel\" pizza which was billed as having sausage, shaved fennel, and roasted red peppers. The peppers were yellow peppers and not roasted and the sausage wasn't my favorite. Unfortunately I picked the wrong pizza, but there was no doubt it was *good* just not in the taste I was looking for. Super high quality, fresh, and in a great portion. The olive oil was singing on the crust and I loved the bite of pepperoni pizza my friend had. The pizza is definitely big enough to share if you supplement it with a side salad or something. (or take home for lunch tomorrow!)  The service was night and you pay right on a little machine they bring to your table.",

Small parking lot on a busy street kinda frustrating but decent pizza with nice ambiance inside. We got the sausage pepperoni brick oven pizza. It was good but definitely need to eat with your hands kind of tough to use with a knife/fork. I got the house red blend wine which was good for $8 value. Nice place to try but if you're looking for AMAZING brick oven my all time fav is still Il Basco off shea and Scottsdale rd!!",

Points off there! Then the counter person left and never came back, many of the 500 employees did not acknowledge  us at all. We waited a few minutes and said ciao! Went to dough bird instead and had great service and pizza! I have had now 3 bad and snotty experiences here, I thought I learned my lesson not to come to this joint but I have a hard head! Don't have a hard head like I did! Choose elsewhere!!",

So much delicious desserts...but might stay away for my own sake lol. The pizzeria side serves a lot of great food too. Their salad that I have tried are delicious and the wings are sooo yummy! Also tried their green chile burger last time I was there! So good. Ordered with the butternut squash they had on special! Yum! Glad I had extra for lunch the next day. For the desserts.. I have tried their famous red velvet which was divine and I also love their salted chocolate chip cookie! The market sells so many cute random stuff like t-shirts, candles, coffee table books, and unicorns! But they could be pricey. And I saw the most beautiful bouquet of flowers last time I was there...$25 though. They do have wine, gelato, and a coffee/juice bar. Oh they're orange juice is so good too!",

Sandwiches are divine. Great salads. Decent amount of seating indoors and some seating outside. They have cute girls delivering pick up orders to people in their cars.  The downside? Parking is extremely small. So be prepared for fights with the Postinos (right behind) crowd for any open street spot.  Can't wait to go back.",

Nothing wrong with ok, but I don't know that I would make an effort to done here again.  I ordered the avocado pizza and added prosciutto to it.  A good amount of prosciutto, but a sad amount of avocado.  One thin slice of avocado on each slice of pizza seems strange for a pizza with avocado in the title.  A little too much basil for my liking.  The service is a little slower, but maybe the night I was there they were understaffed.  Nice ambiance where you can go casual or a little dressy if you like.  If you go here, check out the market next door!  They make homemade English muffins that are delicious and fluffy!  I also recommend a slice of their red velvet cake.",

Tara was super helpful to us a with few of her top picks. The Gluten free Fallen Angel was amazing very tasty especially for gluten free can be pretty tricky. The salads were quite good and it was nice to be able to order delicious breakfast items from Next-door. The food was excellent.  We had such a great experience that we decided to host my husbands birthday brunch for 14 people in the bar which was a hit! Thankfully Tara was working and she was fabulous very attentive,kind and really took care of everyone's needs. Hands down we will be regulars and hanging out with Tara (in the bar)! Thanks for a helping us great time. Ps make sure to get the Brooklyn blackout from the bakery it is one of the best chocolate cakes in Phoenix.",

And don't assume the person taking your order knows what \"vegan\" is even if that is an option for a food item - specify what needs to be removed (and they will happily accommodate) - then double-check the order.  Also, pretty sure I got regular milk in my soy latte - they confirmed it was soy, but it didn't look or taste like soy and I was unconvinced so I dumped it after we left (and after I did a taste test with a new soy latte from somewhere else).  The salads and pizzas are great and the staff is super friendly.  Docking a star for the milk mystery, but I will try their lattes again.",

The downside to LGO is the crowds, confusion where to order during in-between meal hours, and and limited parking. They've accommodated special parking spots for \"to go\", \"20 minutes only\" etc that make it better but valet often is the way to go. Valet is available in back. Very friendly staff. If it's not officially dinner hour there's no table service and you order & pick-up at market. If you're new you might not realize and become frustrated. As often as I've been there I still get confused. Wish they'd revise. Otherwise it's a must see in Arcadia! Kid & Dog friendly too :)",

    "text": "\"LGO\" is great. There is the grocery and the pizzeria - if you go there for breakfast or lunch, you will have to order at the grocery and then there is self-serve seating in the pizzeria. They do not serve pizza until the evening (and then they no longer serve certain sandwiches and other breakfast/lunch items in the evening). In the evening, the pizzeria becomes more of the traditional go to the hostess to be guided to your seat sort of thing. That sort of explains the chaos/mayhem some of the other posts have alluded to that can happen in the mornings. However, I believe this particular entry is for the pizzeria, which is more dinner oriented.  Some tasty dishes that I have had that I would recommend:  Evil Princess Thai Chicken Salad Gladiator Pizza Mushroom Party Pizza (add proscuitto) Avocado Pizza (add proscuitto) Fish Sandwich Cheeseburger on english muffin  The guacamole and cheese dip thingy (it's not called that, but I'm blanking) are good too - I believe it's a three dip appetizer platter of some sort.    The food here is really tasty. They also have some nice bottles of wine on their list (and in the grocery). Great place for a non-stuffy date or for a decent sized group of people (although probably not more than like 8) to share a bunch of pizza/apps.   One last thing: parking can be a real pain. I usually just suck it up and valet - it's free if you get it validated in the restaurant. Throw the valet person a few bucks - why not?",

    "text": "(6/26/2010-lazy posting skills) I've heard about LGO for years but never made an effort to find it or try it until recently.  First time at LGO after a brisk morning walk with my group. After staring at the menu for 10 minutes and getting jostled around by the morning crowd, our party of four came down to these choices: two jersey girl omelets, a daybreaker omelet, and pancakes.  Delicious!  I had a jersey omelet and was enlightened by the huge hunks of pastrami, potatoes, onions and chives embedded my omelet. This morning it was also served with a side berries and two pieces of toasted pumpernickel that made a lovely complement to the pastrami. I didn't get to try the daybreaker, but my friend's plate of turkey, cut cherry tomatoes (lots of spillage, which I love) and smushy, yummy chunks of avocado is making me count down the days until I can schedule another visit!  The crepes looked amazing as well.  I've never had a Havana coffee before, so I gave it a whirl once they told me it had condensed milk.  Growing up with my dad's coffee concoction of milk, coffee, and condensed milk, I didn't think anyone would ever get it.  And then came LGO's Havana coffee.  Now, I'm hooked for life!  I love their Havana Coffee and plan on stopping in again to check out their other breakfast dishes (the Daybreaker!),  Their pizza also looks yummy - will have to check that out as well.   It was also fun to wander around the gourmet/eclectic grocery while we waited for our orders, although we learned quickly that we had to have someone secure a table in the pizzeria or else it would be standing room with your plate.  I saw a lot of neat things stationary and knick knacks for sale, but it was at eclectic prices, so I had to pass.  I did find it cool that they had a few local artists' goods for sale as well.    I can't wait to come back!  Parking is a premium, as many before me have mentioned, so a few recommendations: park across Campbell at the small lot or at the Arcadia Room (also owned by LGO), go for valet parking in the back of LGO, or hope for the best and try to wait for a parking space in the front.  Just don't be \"that person\" and block traffic!",

My friends and I always get this one when we come here and enjoy it with a refreshing pitcher of their rosemary lemonade (with vodka, of course!). Other notable pizzas I've had are the Mother Earth, Rocket Man, and Roasted Corn (love goat cheese on pizza!).   Also, great atmosphere, nice servers, and it's connected to a gelato place to boot!",

    "text": "I have been a 'regular' at LGO for several years now and so I feel pretty comfortable given my extensive experience dining and loitering at LGO to share my thoughts and opinions with the greater community.  Firstly, LGO has a great vibe--it's a haven for 20-something hipsters, posh young families, artsy middle-agers and seniors, hyper five year-olds, and all other walks of life.  You can't enter LGO without feeling instantly happy and energized--Sedona should consider adopting LGO as an additional vortex.  Anyhow, here's my recommendations:  - Breakfast: For a savory meal, try the oh-so fresh Daybreaker Omlette with toast (egg whites with turkey, the freshest and sweetest tomatoes, and avacado; the toast comes with the most delicious jam).  Got a sweet tooth?  Opt for Mia's French Pancakes--this staple somehow masters both tenuous lightness and bodacious decadence at the same time.  Look up magic in Webster's and you'll find a picture of Mia's French Pancakes.   - Lunch: Sonoma Garden Salad is fresh and sweet.  I'm not much of a salad gal, but the Sonoma Garden Salad turns me into a health-nut brontosaurus (fun fact: brontosauri were suckers for leaves).  If you want a light meal with a kick, opt for the Summer Salad Roll--it's a bit spicy, but extremely fresh and hits the spot.   - Dinner: Eats-a-pizza!!  My personal favorite is the Margherita, but you can't go wrong with any selection.  Mushroom Party is pretty fantastic as well.  If you're dining with children, I definitely recommend the PB&J sushi rolls--a sweet treat with sophistication perfect for any tyke.   - Dessert: You can't go wrong with any Tammy Coe confection.  I'm a fan of the mini-cupcakes--a sweet price for just as sweet a baked good that won't spur a post-meal guilt and gym trip.   If you need a sweet wake-up, try the Iced Honey Latte... so yummy!  Of course, the freshly squeezed OJ and made-in-house Arnold Palmers are pretty fantastic picks as well.   You can't go wrong with anything at LGO!  I try to stay as kosher as I can, but my Jewish-turned-agnostic/not-so-Jewish father is an avid fan of the Green Chili Burger and the Rueben sandwich.  (Of course, I've never had either of these so I can't speak much about them as any other selection).  So try them for yourselves and let me know what you think!   Oh and just FYI, the scrumpdiliumptiousness of the food is commensurate with the terror of parking at LGO.  There is complimentary valet in the back by Postino's--just make sure you don't make my mistake of not putting your car into park before getting out of the car and letting your vehicle drive into the luxury car in front of you...  Anyhoo, happy dining and hope you have a sunny time at La Grande Orange!",

I am not sure if LGO is part of the slow-food movement, but when I am here my expectations are not to get in and get out fast.  I like to slow down, enjoy my beverage, relax.  When the food is ready it never dissappoints.    I like to the see Lambroginis parked next to beat up Hundais in the parkling lot too.  The place is good enough for the Arcadian elite, and just fine for me and the rest of us peasants too!  The prices are very reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food.  If you hype the place up too much to your friends, they may be disappointed.  Think of it as a nice place to go, go there, and enjoy yourselves.",

    "text": "I love this place - definitely one of my favs in Phoenix area. Pizza is great, sandwiches wonderful, burger - I would skip. Today I had the green chile cheese burger on a recommendation of someone I met at Postino's. I don't think he is from New Mexico.   I got the burger and it was huge, with a pile a shredded cheese on top. Not melted shredded cheese just shredded cheese on the burger and chile. On the other side was nice looking pickles, purple raw onion and slices of tomato. I hurriedly smashed the burger sides together in hopes of melting some of the cheese(didn't work). Sliced the burger in half and took a bite. Unfortunately I bit right into the strongest onion I've eaten in years. After that I couldn't taste anything. Especially the green chile, it looked beautiful but I couldn't get any flavor out of it. When I added the sea salt provided on the table it tasted better. The fries were great though. I had a Mirror Pond on tap! That was delicious.   The other thing that I found highly annoying was I needed utensils, napkins and plates so I went to a table in the corner where there was wrapped utensils in white cloth napkins and small plates. I asked the service person if I could get these to take to the table. She said no get them from the other side of the restaurant. Where I found cheap utensils, paper napkins and no plates. I took a large amount of napkins (I have two boys eating pizza) and utensils. My boys didn't enjoy eating off of the wooden board the pizza comes on so my husband got up and just took two plates.   Not FIVE minutes later the woman I spoke to started placing the same wrapped utensils and plates onto the empty tables where the next guests sat. HUH? I understand they were transitioning to dinner but really? You couldn't just hand them to me?   Other than that it's a wonderful place we will be back again and again.",

My husband turns on our oven to 450 degrees and puts the whole pizza on a pizza stone for about 3 minutes.  The pizza is perfect and delicious.  We devour it and always wish there was one more piece.  As we are reaching for the last pieces I always notice the look on his face (and I know I have the same look) of longing....wishing there was more.  I'm drooling now just thinking about it.",

Have I been to LGO 20+ times, no. Is my house close enough so I can just check in during the morning and evening if I feel like it, yes. Do I just do this to annoy my friends who are all about \"Check-Ins,\" yes. Is it dishonest, yes. Is it distasteful, yes. Do I care, no. Is this review going to have bad grammar and punctuation, yes.  Now lets get back to LGO. When you first walk into LGO, you might get a little overwhelmed. Boy you will definitely get overwhelmed. They have options galore. So many options. It's almost too much of a variety. I mean they have mothers and daughters and highschoolers and college girls and Divorced women and desperate women and the list goes on and on.   The mothers stop in for some lunch after their Village workout on a Tuesday afternoon because honestly, don't you go to LGO after your Village workout on a Tuesdsay afternoon? What kind of jobs do these women do to allow them such a luxurious lifestyle? I'm just kidding, we all know what kind of jobs they do, the jobs that begin with an \"H\" or a \"B\" thats for sure.  But fellows, if you come here on the weekend be ready to get into a pissing contest with the elites around you. Two weekends ago I saw a Fararri parked next to a Lamborghini (I have no idea if those are spelled right, sue me for not being of the people who feel spaghetti and meatballs should be served three meals a day). But all is good at LGO.  These are the exact reasons why everyone should come here. I've been told they serve food. But between the fancy cars and the sexually determined women, who has time to eat?",

    "text": "Been to this place a few times and I have never been disappointed. The crust texture is what pizza is meant to taste like. If you don't know now, then you'll learn when you get to LGO.  The LGP Chips and Dips plate is a great way to start your meal here. My favorite pizzas are the Roasted Corn, Avocado Pizza (add proscuitto), and the Gladiator. The guys in my group couldn't get enough of the Gladiator. It's a meaty guy-type pizza and guys will forget about that \"I-can't-get-a-good,-satisfying-meal-at-a-trendy-restaurant\" feeling. Overall, I love the unique pizza toppings at this restaurant and the quality ingredients they use. If you're looking to take a Phoenix visitor to a decent pizza meal in Phoenix then this is the place for you.   THe little grocery shop next door has all sorts of fun knickknacks to look at. The gelato shop also next door has tasty gelatos, that is, if you have enough room once you're done at LGO.",

I've been frequenting LGO since day-1 some ten years ago and always enjoy myself.  BREAKFAST SUGGESTION:  The perfect amount of nutrition and food for breakfast as I see it is 1/2 order of Granloa, Friut and Yogurt . . . granola roasted fresh each and every day.  PIZZA SUGGESTION: Try the gluten-free roasted pizza-crust 1/2 corn & goat cheese and add avocado and the other 1/2 classic margherita pizza and you'll not be disappointed.  If you're in the mood for a glass of wine, the Moobuzz Pinot Noir slightly chilled is a great complement.  PARKING: The Desert Parking valet guys are always gentlemen and will treat you special each and every time.  They will recognize you by name and if I ran as fast as they do to bring the car around, I'd loose a chin or two :-)  Keep up the good work LGO . . .   MURF",

The Rocket Man claims to be \"SPICY\" but was not spicy at all when I ordered it. Mushroom Party is superb as well, the fennel really makes this one memorable.The crust is really good. The pizzas are on the small side, you could probably scarf one all by yourself, but I recommend going with a group and ordering a variety so you can try all the funky combinations.   Service is good, parking is hell on earth for dinner and all day on the weekends.  But like another reviewer said, if you know this going in, you'll be okay.",

We ordered a pizza and continued to play boggle and hang out..a memory I'll never forget.   So here are some of my favs;  pizza's always delicious but when you can breakfast all day, the commuter is my number one pick. Mixing the tea's is definitely a good move to make & they've e also got amazing pre-made salads for the ones who need something quick and on the go. Most recently i had  a delicious turkey sandwich & a burger with my roommate to share. Although they forgot the burger, the free cookies they let us eat after made it all worth the while.  Too bad I was too full to hit the gelato spot attached to the dining area but then again, there's always next time!!   Though parking is often a b***h you'll lose any sense of anger after walking inside their doors. The workers are friendly and the music sets tone for great times.   GO GO GO TO LGO even if your getting your food to go, they'll bring it straight to your car, uber convenient eh?",

They say 25 minutes, I show up in 25 minutes, and the pizza has obviously been sitting there and is cold. They say 30 minutes, I show up at 20, I am chastised for showing up \"early\", then I sit for another 30 waiting for the goddam pizza. This is late nite too and totally ridiculous.  We walked over there the other day for coffee and the crowd was a nightmare. At this point, I'm just sick of it. It is actually a negative that I live around the corner and can go whenever. It would be better if it were further away and therefore an \"event\" for us to check it out.   Anyway, it's a cool place sure. I like the \"co-op\" feel and they sell some really cool beers.

    "text": "I've been a fan of LGO for quite some time.  Whenever my husband and I go here we always leave with smiles on our faces.  We have been here countless times and never had one bad experience.    When my husband saw the picture of the green chili burger on the LGO FaceBook page yesterday, he decided two things: #1-he wanted to go here for lunch and #2-he wanted that delicious looking burger.  So we went and yes, parking isn't easy and there is always a line but we don't care about that because we always find a spot and the line goes really quickly (plus there is fun stuff to peruse while waiting in line).  It also helps that our mouths were watering for their food!    The staff is always friendly and helpful and yesterday was no exception.  I also appreciate how the managers here are part of the team-expediting food orders and cleaning tables-while still smiling and being friendly to customers.  That is awesome.  So back to the food.  I got the pizzeria chop salad with no raisins and no olives and it was fantastic.  Luckily for me, my husband likes to share his food and my two bites of his green chili burger were OUTSTANDING.  Messy, but delicious.  The fries were great too.  We both tried something we hadn't tried from the menu before and again, we left with smiles on our faces talking about how yummy our lunch was.  That is a definite win-win situation-thank you LGO for being consistently delicious and for having a staff that rocks!!",

We were looking through places to go to within a 10 mile radius, when we ran into LGO on yelp. I have been inside to check it out, but never had I had dinner there. What a fantastic decision! The place is so nice, they play good music and the wine we loved was on the list... For 10 dollars a bottle! I couldn't believe it! I thought it was $10 a glass! We had arrived later than we thought we would've, but no one ever made us feel uncomfortable or unwelcome. I was so pleased with Ryan, our server. Super nice, very accommodating and knowledgeable. Right before leaving, I asked to speak to a manager to give Ryan a commendation, and was even more pleased when talking to Chris. I have worked in restaurants before, and rarely have I met a manager (owner?) so personable, warm and genuinely kind. This SUPER nice guy, who treats his employees very well, was helping the place close down. His philosophies of being in the business were spot on and pragmatic. I was so pleased with the service overall, that even if the food was bad, I would go back. Good thing it was lovely. Please go here, you will love it.",

From the little coffee bar, to the delicious gourmet sandwiches, from the sweet gifts you can look over while waiting in line, to the sweet deserts behind the counter.    My personal favorite, (being someone who doesn't cook nor eat fast food) is the curb side take out.  After a long day at the office, I call in my favorite Kale Salad, drive into the parking lot and pay as if I just went through a drive-through, but am rewarded with a gourmet salad.  Perfect fast-healthy dinner.",

    "text": "Lemon zest?  On a pizza?    Yeah, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it.  I decided to put my faith in LGO to create a wonderful pizza experience.  And that they did!  My final verdict; the Avocado Pizza is heavenly!  The creamy avocado, sweet tomatoes, summery basil, bright lemon zest, and add in the salty prosciutto and you have yourself a pretty tasty pizza.  The best part is that you don't see that kind of pizza on the menu everywhere you go.   The even better part is the sourdough crust!!  So delicious!  All of their pizza creations sound amazing.  I can't wait to try them all!  A few more tries and I easily see a fifth star in their future.  It did take us a few minutes to figure out the lunch flow of the place.   - Order your food on the grocery side,  - find your own table on the pizzeria side,  - wait for your sandwich on the grocery side, - listen for your pizza on the pizzeria side, - ask for more ice at the coffee stand, - fill your ice tea at the table at the doorway between the two - go back to the grocery side to pick your dessert from the case (trust me, you do not want to skip this step!)  In addition to the wonderful pizza and the lunch with great friends, LGO also provided a bright spot in my day by putting one of my favorite (hard-to-find) red wines right by the cashier for $10 less than I usually get it at AJ's.  Score!!",

I highly recommend the Mother Earth ...(if you're feeling daring, add goat cheese!) Another favorite is the Roasted Corn Pizza, add some of their housemade sausage!! Ohh and did I mention their insanely perfect pimento dip?!? It rocks my world every time! (Uhg, I'm even guilty of ordering just an order of the dip to go! I blame it on the fact that we're neighbors and it's too easily accessible.) This place is on the top of our 'favorites' list and I can guarantee that you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "This was one of the last bookmarked pizza places in Phoenix left on my list.  My buddies had left back to Vegas, and I had an afternoon to myself.  I figured that it would be a perfect time to drive down here and try it out.  I had studied their menu previously, and there was one pizza that stood out above all the rest......The Rocket Man.  I am pretty much allergic to vegetables, but if you throw them on some dough, and bake it, I am down to eat my veggies!  The Rocket Man sounded delicious.  I knew for sure that I was going to get that.  I called in my order and arrived just a few minutes before it was ready.  I found a 25 minute parking spot out front and walked inside.  I paid for my pizza and also ordered a Sea Salted Chocolate Chip Cookie.  I took a seat and a few minutes later, my pizza was ready.  Here is how it was......................  Rocket Man Pizza ($14.00) -  I had done my research before, and I knew this was going to be a winner.  This pizza comes topped with spicy red Fresno chiles, broccolini, roasted orange peppers, roasted garlic and sun dried tomatoes.  These toppings are laid upon a super thin sourdough crust.  Side rant.....  Sourdough is my favorite bread.  You could give me some sourdough bread and butter as my last meal, and I would be content and die a happy man.  LGO's sourdough pizza crust is beyond amazing!  The thinness of the crust and the excellent chew and flavor make this one of the best crusts I have ever had.  It was like eating flat sourdough rolls topped with pizza goodies.  Here is why I know it is was so good...... I was still full from lunch when I picked up my pizza.  I sampled 2 small slices right when I got in my car and could have probably polished off the pizza.  This pizza was on point.  One of the best in Phoenix.  Instantly catapulted into my top 3 in the Valley.  The toppings were plentiful, colorful and delicious. All those veggies made the pizza sing!  The \"spicy\" Fresno chiles weren't really spicy at all..still very tasty though.  The peppers, tomatoes, broccolini and garlic were a flavor explosion and added great texture to the pizza, too.  I'm usually not the \"veggie pizza\" type person, but this thing breaks down all stereotypes and preconceived notions on what a veggie pizza should taste like.  I'm still thinking about it.  I took the rest of the pizza home and had 2 slices cold later in the evening.  Still just as good.  That sourdough crust is something else!  A few hours later, I reheated the pizza in the oven for a little bit so that the cheese would melt again and the crust would warm up.  Once again, amazing flavors and still just as good as freshly made.  You know its good when you eat it A. Fresh, B. Cold and C. Reheated.  Each and every occurrence was delicious!  I can preach how good the sourdough crust is until the cows come home.  You just have to go and try it yourself.  As long as you like sourdough bread, I guarantee you will be impressed and instantly fall in love with it!  Sea Salted Chocolate Chip Cookie ($3.00) -  I had read about these cookies in all of the Yelp reviews.  I saw them sitting there in the case and knew I had to get one.  $3.00 a cookie seems a bit steep, but these cookies are HUGE and totally worth the  money.  The cookies had a little crunch on the outside and were pretty soft on the inside.  The chocolate wasn't totally melted, but the chocolate chips were soft and easy to chew on.  The salt on top really put this over the top.  You got salty, sweet and savory all in one bite.  These things could become very addictive!  I wish I had ordered a few more of them.  Service was friendly enough.  The store is pretty \"hip\" too.  I was lucky to find parking in the lot (It was about 4pm in the afternoon) and didn't have to wait long for my food to be ready.  I really cannot wait until I come back to eat some more of that sourdough crust.  You could throw some dog shit on top of that crust, and it would still taste good!  Yup...I said it.  Possibly the best pizza crust I have ever had...anywhere....and I have eaten lots and lots of pizza around the country.  Come and try it for yourself!",

I don't know why, its not like there was anyone behind me.  whatever.   I wanted to order an ice tea, but found that I had to order from a different line. what? huh ummm okay.  whatever.   I sat thinking \"hmm this better be some bomb ass pizza\" finally it comes out and it was disappointing.  It wasn't terrible, but it just wasn't good.

It was delicious, but there is no mention on the menu about an upcharge for making a pizza vegan and that's just shady business. Unfortunately, that's not the thing that's changed. What used to be a date night / adult spot has turned into a playground. Until we left around 9:30, there were children at every table, babies crying and kids screaming and running around. \"Where are all of their parents?\", was the question of the night. I can put up with untrained servers and questionable business practice for good vegan pizza, but I'm not going back if the majority of the crowd is under 12 and caffeinated. No thank you.",

Anyway, our server was uber attentive and downright cheerful- very welcoming. I appreciated this a lot and it really changed my outlook on this place.  In addition to my usual (reliably delicious) pizza, I ordered the smoked salmon salad and it was awesome. It had dried cranberries, cous cous, corn, and sunflower seeds. I should have asked for cheese though because I'm one of \"those people\"  who doesn't love a salad unless it has cheese. I'm pretty juvenile that way.   For dessert, I had the A to Z cookie and oh em geee was it scrumptious! It had peanuts, pretzel pieces, and a plethora of other tasty add ins that made it MY NEW FAVE!  Very very pleased with LGO and looking forward to my next visit.",

We stood in a line that winds itself through a hip version of a Cracker Barrel lobby. The menu is written on chalkboards high above the register/bakery counter area. Because there is so much on the menu the words are difficult to read. When we got to the register we then came upon menu sheets. With a line of people waiting behind us I felt rushed to order.  The cheesecake we ordered to share was immediately handed to us so of course we ate as soon as we sat down. It was delicious! This is the only reason I am giving the restaurant two stars.  After a few minutes hubby's name was yelled. To get to the food was a journey through tables, around a long pub table (8 chairs long) down to the end of the bar.  We both ordered basic food. I had a cheeseburger with a pile of grated cheese that melted into a lump, a thin slice of pickle, and 2 of the worse excuses for tomato slices (honestly I would have been embarrassed to serve them). Hubby had the green chili cheeseburger which he proclaimed to be okay.   Our sides were Caesar salad (him) which was fresh and fries (me) which were cold and salty. The fries were so salty that they could have walked across the table and shook hands with the napkins I was using to wipe off my fingers. I gave up on my lunch after eating 1/3 of the burger and 5 of the fries.  We spent $38 for two sub par burgers, bottled drinks and a dessert to share. Should have gone to Freddy's - they call your number instead of yelling your name, have better food and cost a hell of a lot less.",

I know it sounds weird, but if you love avocados as much as I do, you'll love the pizza! I added on chicken because it doesn't come with any meat. I'm sure you can add on whatever kind of meat you want. The crust is out of this world!  If any of you gentlemen out there need someone to come and accompany you to La Grande Orange, I'm your gal!

I ordered the Gladiator (sausage and pep) and I added black olives and mushrooms. Upon my first bite, I looked at the rest of the pizza and said, \"I'm finishing this...by myself\".  The cheese, tomato sauce have a bold enough flavor but not rich enough to make you only want to eat a slice or two. The Shrooms are sauteed give it an earthy flavor and the black olives give a bit of salt which I love.   But the crust...oh my. It is thin, a bit chewy and crunchy on the outside. It has a bit of an Asiago flavor as well which I have never had before. Kind of reminded me of an Asiago bagel.   I will definitely be back for more and I suggest you stop by for some great pizza!!",

    "text": "Mediocre at best.... went here for breakfast at the recommendation of a few people and after reading reviews on several sites. Ordered the guacamole BLT and was disappointed. The bread was stale and falling apart while trying to eat the sandwich. There was a very generous portion of bacon which was great but the guacamole was almost nonexistent. It was the thinnest layer of guacamole. Since it is called the guacamole BLT I expected there to be a good amount of it on the sandwich. To make things worse, I took the sandwich back and told them the bread was stale and they were taken back. They looked at me like I had 3 eyes and no ears. They said \" the bread can not be stale, we bake it here. We have NEVER had anyone complain about the bread\". Really? I am the very first person to say the bread was stale and it was crumbling in my hands while I am eating the sandwich? Wow, I am completely shocked. They made a new sandwich on a different bread and again there was barely any guacamole. At that point I was just going to eat it and go. I was worried that if I went up again they would look at me sideways. Since they have never had anyone complain before I am positive they have never had anyone complain twice! Anyways, I tried it, crossed it off the list and don't have to worry about writing it on my list of favorites.",

I would say one thing they could improve on is making the grocery store part a like less cluttered. Don't bring your stroller in there! It's too hard to navigate around without knocking into stuff!",

So now it's time to throw in my five stars for one of my favorite places in P-town.  La Grande Orange is know for their pizza and for good reason - it's delicious. The boyfriend and I went there for dinner on Monday night, which is a great night to go if you don't want to wait. We ordered our usual - a caesar salad and the gladiator pizza - sausage and pepperoni.  Our waitress was nice enough to split the salad on two plates for us. We both love this salad. It has a rich and tangy dressing, huge croutons and lots of shaved slices of fresh parmesan cheese. The cheese really makes this salad IMO. And the portion is perfect for two people. Kinda like the pizza. It's just the right size to share. If you have 3 or 4 people in your group definitely get more than one. The crust is thin and crispy, they use just the right amount of sauce and it's not overly greasy.   The atmosphere is cool but comfy and the service is always great. Parking can be a challenge but they do offer valet if you can't find a spot. And of course be sure to stop by the grocery afterwards - good stuff!",

I'm not sure what I can say that hasn't already been said, but LGO is a classic gem in Phoenix. It's nestled among quaint houses full of character and as you walk in, you'll most likely see several beach cruisers parked along the building, waiting for their owners who take a morning bike ride to grab a bite to eat.   I visit LGO when I want to pretend that I'm in California or on the ocean, or in Europe or even if I want to forget that it's 100+ degrees outside. I visit LGO when I need to do work but want to get out of my normal routine. I can grab some food and set up shop at one of the several tables or booths, or even outside. Plus, I don't need to worry about my battery dying here, for they have several power outlets so I can keep my computer's juices flowing for hours.   The scene here is crazy, cool, relaxing and fun all at the same time. I'll see every type of Phoenician here and they all blend and vibe with each other like it's no big deal. The music is going, the kitchen is hustling with orders, people are chatting with old and new friends and the smell of freshly baked goods and coffee fill the air.   The food here is delicious. Where to even start? Well for starters, I'll touch upon the breakfast. If I'm feeling fatty and in a hurry, I'll opt for one of their delicious muffins. If I'm feeling healthy and in a hurry, I'll go for the yogurt, granola and fruit. And...if I'm feeling fatty and lazy, I'll order one of their delicious hot meals and sit there and enjoy it. Lunchtime is my favorite and it most likely has something to do with their food. I adore the tuna melt but I only order it on calorie-counting free days. I also like the tuna salad, and turkey stack sandwich. Anything on their menu is amazing. Now moving on to dinner. Yes friends, they serve the famous Chelsea's hamburger here, so I can fulfill my cravings without having to fight the Chelsea's crowds. Their pizza is for champions and delectable. The pizza kitchen doesn't open until four and goes until late hours in the night. It's a perfect spot for a casual yet tasty meal.   I will leave with a couple additional tidbits of fun facts. They sell the reusable plastic glasses that are trending up the city these days. While it's pricey on the front end ($12+), you can then fill it with coffee (even iced) or tea for I want to say just a dollar or two which isn't bad!   Craving LGO but can't find a space or better yet, too lazy to get out and walk in like I am half the time? Luckily the lazy fairies are watching over us for LGO offers some excellent curbside pick-up. I will call on my way there, drive in, park, they come right out, I give them my card, they grab the food, I pay, and I'm on my way. It's seamless and I love it... just like I love LGO as a whole. I wish they opened one walking distance to me.",

The only good thing about this place is they get the food out quick. We went there last night for dinner and enjoyed our meal. My brother in law realized he left his phone at the restaurant so went back to hunt it down. Upon talking with the manager he explained that the phone was absolutely not there. He claimed to have gotten down with a flashlight and looked under and around the table. My brother in law asked him if they could turn the music down just a little to try and hear the phone just to have the ponce manager claim it would \"ruin the esthetics of the restaurant\"... There was a max of 12 people in the restaurant!! After searching around the table for a few minutes they found the phone under the table in the corner that the manager claimed he had already checked.. This kind of \"customer service\" is disgusting and the manager would do good at focusing more on keeping customers happy than HIS esthetics. Shame on you.",

Sundays after a climb on camelback make for a great brunch/lunch dealio. Every time I get a take-out salad from LGO - people always ask me where I got it from.

    "text": "i really wanted to like this place - a lot, since so many people I know seem to love it.  But much like many other trendy wanna-be higher end joints, I think the average upper-middle class customer base wants to like it so much they don't care how they are treated.  I however, am not blinded by overpriced food and nifty decor.  This place is chaotic, overpriced and unfortunately has pretty decent food regardless. Super snobby hipster or sorority girl staff - not just one or two, but MOST OF THEM. I failed to meet one friendly person working there any time I have been in.  I registered on Yelp simply to leave this review.  Going in at 3pm-ish is kinda a bad idea since they are in the middle of shifting from lunch to dinner set-up and no-one wants to help you.  You still have to order at the counter...my go-to is the pretty darned decent (but messy) veggie burger.  But that is all you get - no chips or anything.  Its enough but don't expect fancy.  So yesterday we go in for my honey's birthday.  We both order the veggie burger.  We were the only ones eating in the place, but other patrons were hanging out finishing up or studying with desert.    First, they are already clearing the tables and setting for dinner.  No biggy right.  Problem is they take all the napkin dispensers off the tables and replace with place settings.  Great.  But people still come in to eat during this time.  So, no tables had napkins. I ask the guy doing the settings if we could get a napkin.  He ignores me.  I chock it up to not hearing me.  A few minutes go by, still no food, still no napkins.  So I get up and go ask the guy (same guy that ignored me) who is standing in front of a huge basket of cloth dinner napkins if we could get a couple. His response - NO! and that I needed to go find a napkin dispenser....!! say what?! last time I checked I wasn't on the payroll. And Seriously dude!  I am not good enough for a cloth napkin 2 inches from your face after you removed all the paper napkins available?  Needless to say I myself had to go hunt down the last table that had a dispenser on it - outside.  After a very long wait, and much needed napkins in hand,  we finally get our burgers.  Great.  We take them to the table and my honey decides its a little bland and want mustard. She goes back up front and was told point-blank that if she had wanted mustard she should have ordered it and the only one that could give her mustard was the person calling out the food order - who was no longer around. Soooo, in an effort to be the better person we chose not to make a scene over mustard. Are you kidding me?  You can't turn around to the guy in the kitchen standing a foot away from you and say hey dude, can you hand me the mustard for a customer....NOPE!  We were freaking refused MUSTARD!   And again, this was on my honeys birthday.  We chose to spend part of our special day here and not, one, not two, but every single staffer was rude on some level.  We decided not to get coffee and dessert and chose to spend our money elsewhere.    I am a customer service freak and the times I had been here before were so busy I couldn't tell if it was me being stressed by the environment, or if the customer service sucked! I chose to give them the benefit of the doubt, but now that I have been here without it being busy at all, I know it is just the ATTITUDE of this place. We will NEVER be back.",

    "text": "I really enjoying coming to LGO with my girlfriend about 1 hour before closing.  We found that when we go too early there is very little parking and there is always a wait.  So we opted to go later and have found this to be the best time.  The wait staff is very nice and helpful around this time too, since it close to closing the staff is more relaxed and fun.  With less people in the place it also makes for a more romantic setting.  I really enjoy getting half Lime Avocado and half roasted corn pizza.  I feel you get the best of both worlds with this half and half.  Nice cool and smooth texture when you bite into the Lime Avocado slice and then the roasted corn slice gives you a pop of flavor and.  I have found that the wine selection has a few good choices to complete the pizza or if you are a pizza and beer person the beer selection is average.  You will be able to find a beer that you like on the list.  If you feel like getting a little desert when you are done with your meal then you go can walk next door and get some delicious gelato; that is if you get done with your dinner before they close.",

I wasn't disappointed, and am definitely adding this to my list of absolute favorite pizza places. The crust, cheese, mmmm it was all amazing. LGO is also a really great atmosphere. Only downside is that parking is very difficult and if you don't know those streets very well, it is confusing to know where to park.",

She helped me figure out if I should order the nachos for my 4 year old (which I did and she enjoyed them immensely.  She also had french fries - these are magically delicious! I could come here just to eat french fries all night. The food was delicious. I had the green chile burger on the english muffin. It really is the best burger in town! My friend has the gladiator pizza. He seemed to enjoy it as well. The only thing I didnt like is the iced tea. I do not like the new iced (and that was my fault because I didnt ask which iced tea it was), next time I will make sure I order a soda or something.",

But, it's order at the counter style, so no matter how busy it is, you can get your order in. Then the only problem is finding a table. We finally got one, but it was RIGHT by the main entrance, so not the best feng shui.   PROS: The patio is dog-friendly, it's a happening spot, they have a unique menu, and you can get your order in right away.  CONS: Parking is a nightmare. It's really packed. They call your name when your order is ready and it's IMPOSSIBLE to hear them call you when it's busy, so if you're not waiting right by the kitchen, your food will get cold! Mine did. Also, strangely, the tables do not have salt and pepper on them...so...um...bring your own??? idk. I like to put salt and pepper on my eggs, but there wasn't any on the table! Also, NO HOT SAUCE! I asked the woman at the counter for hot sauce, and she seemed surprised! She said to ask the people at the coffee counter....weird. Um...no...they did not have any hot sauce at the coffee counter. I'd still go back again, but I would just bring salt, pepper, and hot sauce!",

The lemony flavors played well with the rest of the pizza, but the cheese was a little too hard for me - it seemed like there was a lot of parm in the mix.    Docking stars for the nightmare that is LGO parking, and the extreme darkness - there's a fine line between \"romantic\" lighting, and \"dark\" - my companion and I had genuine trouble making out what was on the table.  Also, I regularly stuff my face with delicious pizzas, and giving LGO the same rating as Motorino feels wrong.",

It had a big \"Come In\" sign. When you open the door you walk through the kitchen, kinda awkward, but whatevs. We look at the menu.. I decide to order a salad and my husband picks a sandwich, Great! Go to order and find out that sandwiches are only served untill 5. Ok, no big deal, but why doesn't the menu say that? OK, he will have a salad too , except he wants to modify it a bit. Hmm the salads are pre-made so that's not happening. I order my salad and he will look over the menu while we sit down. We head over the the main seating area, only to be told we can not sit there because we ordered our food on the grocery side. It would have been great for somebody to tell us that! So we head to the grocery side to find seating. Well, the seating on the grocery side is minimal and it was not kid friendly. We decided to go ask for a refund for my untouched salad so that we could have dinner where we could sit comfortably. They redeemed themselves when we were told of picnic benches available to sit and offered to bring us a high chair. It kinda of bothered me that we were only offered a highchair AFTER asking for a refund. It's standard practice to offer a high chair for people with children. I orderd the Sanoma Garden Salad. It was ok, but nothing amazing and the portion was rather small.  My husband decided to get food elsewhere",

I love the croque madame, it is an open faced sammy with ham, tomato, spicy mustard, and an egg topped with gruyere and broiled to perfection. The lemon ricotta hotcakes are also really good as are the chilaquiles. The coffee is some of the best in arcadia, and I always buy a bag of beans (Mr. Espresso) to take home. I also purchase a cold coffee press here and I use it almost every day.   Lunch and dinner usually lack the frenzy of people and can be a bit more relaxed. The pizza is great and the wait is never very long.   The food is fresh, the employees are nice and it is great for people watching. Sit outside and soak in the gorgeous weather we are sure to have for at least 2 more months!",

I had ordered and asked a question, so she asked a coworker who told her she'd made a mistake, and there was no deal. I asked for it to be honored and got a no. A manager was brought over, she honored what I was told. Still no apology, I thanked the woman who made the mistake when paying. She told me not to expect this discount ever again. I was floored.

A bit odd to forget to write a review on a pizza place when I'm driving around town trying all the pizza places, no?  Perhaps it's because their pizza was completely forgettable.  We showed up later in the evening, and I was having a very hard time finding a pie that I could get really excited about.  So I went with a straight-up meat pizza.  My friend went with a similar one, but a little more toned down.  I don't know what it was, but I just did not care for the pizza at all.  I didn't care for the crust - I thought it needed to be a little less tough.  They way overdid it on the pepperoni, completely overpowering everything else.  It was like Peter Piper without skeeball.  My friend made a better choice with his pie, but it would have still been below average at any of the wood fired pizza places we've visited lately.  The place was nice and quaint, though, and the attached grocery was kind of nice.  But LGO's pizza simply does not stack up.",

I wasn't aware that the pizzeria doesn't open until 4PM so you have to kind of get up and do everything yourself -- go to the grocery to order your food and to the bar separately to get a drink. So, pretty casual during the day. I started with a white sangria and it was delicious, not very strong but fruity and refreshing. Had 3 orange slices in it & an apple slice & grape halve. Then because I wasn't too hungry I got the side cucumber salad & it was good -- cucumbers, avocado, tomatoes, olives, goat cheese I think?, and a side dressing & for only $3.50! Everyone else that I was with got the pizza & it looked amazing, next time I'm coming on an empty stomach to try it. I did have a quarter of the kids pizza & even that was good. Next time I come, it will be after 4PM so I can experience more of the restaurant part of it. Oh and its Arcadia so parking sucks, you pretty have to valet.",

Now if you can please lower that horrible new loud music so we can enjoy conversations at the table without shouting and without headaches.

Once upon a time you may have been worth it but with so many solid offerings in Phoenix these days your entitled attitude is not warranted.  No it's cool, I'll clear off the table that you just walked by four times with nothing in your hands.  What's that?  Oh I shouldn't do that?  I should just stand here and look at the table full of dishes until you walk by a 6th time?  Ok.  Hey, one more thing. Kiss my ass.",

    "text": "Came here last night with the family and despite zero parking in the front, the restaurant wasn't too packed. Finding parking in the front is like trying to spot the Loch Ness monster...it ain't gonna happen. But, there is complimentary valet in tne back for LGO patrons, so that is nice. Anyways, it has been a couple of years since we have been back which is surprising because this is always a fave. The pizzas range around $13-$14 and you can easily make two meals out of it or feed two people. We ordered the half dozen chicken wings as an app, a white sangria for me and a beer for my husband. My daughter had a $3 PB&J that consisted of 4-5 tiny PB&J \"sushi\" rolls and a rather large pile of french fries for a kids meal. I would have liked more of the sandwich than fries but it was only $3 so I'll deal with it. I had the Padre (no longer on the menu) and had it modified to be with blue cheese, prosciutto, and arugula. It is a white pizza, so no tomato sauce. The crust is a little crusty and chewy...just the way I like it. My husband ordered his favorite, the Fallen Angel. Our server was really attentive and very patient with our daughter. After dinner, we walked into the grocer next door to satisfy our sweet tooth. Ooey gooey cookies were to be had (at $2.50 a pop...yikes!) and they melted in my mouth, so yummy.  Pizza, wine, and chocolate chip cookies???? Now that is what I call the perfect meal.",

Ordered the \"fallen angel\" and this time it wasn't duplicated, lacked flavor, minuscule amount of sausage and the crust was really chewy.   We ordered a fish sandwich for take-away.  It had a very fishy smell that permeated through the packaging on our way to our lodging.  Our hostess who we had ordered it for declared it overcooked, but than I should know better than to order fish for take-away and from a facility that really doesn't do fish, unless you count the tuna.",

LGO kills it.  first of all they made me a vegan burger that was extra-terestrial.  i was with a friend that is not vegan and he decieded to order one too. he was like ...ah what the heck?  (he loved and said \"with choices like this eating vegan must be very easy\")  we got them on english muffins, as that is the only True vegan bread they have and it was  a good choice.  the gal who took my order took it very seriously and suggested the EM as an alterative to the bun. HOW NICE!!!!  all the food here is great, if you love pizza, the margahita or whatever is a great way to go.  i got mine with double sauce and half cheese, but man, i have been to naples, and i have eaten in naples, and this is just like it.  the crust is perfect,   it lies somewhere in this mysterious land between candy and just down the road from wedding cake.  i dont know how bob does it but he wont put out a dish unless its perfect.  i have chatted with him over the years and when i used to work at AJ's.  he was researching the pork chop for houston's.  he asked me all kind of questions, and was really taking me seriously about my answers, imagine that.  back then i had no idea who he was.  anyway it was like 7 years later when i finally noticed the pork chop on the menu.  i noticed that some of the things i had suggested, were actually in the prep of the PC,   i dont know if my input had anything to do with it, (actually prob not) but it did make me feel good.  bob has that way about him, if he is not there to make youf feel good personally, his food will do the heavy lifting in his absencse.  the word is out on this place, everyone knows its good, and supprisingly cheep.  i mean its totally awesome chow, and around $25 bucks???   you cant go to burger king for 25bucks   my only regret is that he does not have any chow-houses in northern cal.  so going to his resturants in southern cal or PHX is a rare, cherished treat.  until then i will be dreaming of his pizzas , veggie burgers, and iced tea",

Of course good food, jeez, let me get to that, but as far as elemental funtastic vibes are concerned, this place hits the mark on many points.      Ok, so the food. Yum. I really like the Daybreaker that is an egg white omelet with turkey and their own tomato avocado salsa but the other day I ventured into \"normalcy\" and just had 2 eggs cooked \"my way\" and bacon which maybe I stand alone on this, but love it crispy and it was perfect. You can also get a bottle of wine and they'll open it for you, but overall, the place is kind of self serve which is fine because I can serve myself. Get your own napkins, water, coffee fixings, etc. Think I can handle that for a change.      LGO is the ideal complement to the next door Postino, especially if you're out for the day. LGO grocery for breakie/brunch then off to Postino for some $5 wines daydrinking extravaganza...they're like the Bert and Ernie of Campbell & 40th street. Or maybe a better reference would be Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel seeing the one is better during the day and one is better during the night.       Ah, references shmereferences.

The place is small, with very limited parking, but I think they offer free valet from what I heard.  I'm kind of between 3 and 4 stars for this place, but decided to round up since it really is one of a kind and quite enjoyable.  When I go to places like this, I tend to hold the bar high, and expect a little bit more then the usual, so please bear with me while I do some  venting AND complimenting.  After going inside the place was really cute and well decorated.  Plenty of seating with lots of stuff to shop for!  I did find the ordering to be a bit confusing, and somewhat irritating.  You go to the register and place your order, and their supposed to call your name, but we sat there for a while and never heard anything.  I finally went to the counter and I guess our food had sat out there for a while and no one ever told us! No one called our name, nothing!  Plus, they just left the food on this table to get picked up, and anyone could have taken it without us realizing it.  Also, we were extremely thirsty and were looking for water and asked when we went to place our order.  They said that there's water glasses by a complimentary water station in the dining area.  The glasses were tiny, and there wasn't any ice!  ggggrrrr. It's hot here and we're THIRSTY.  Plus, that area is really tight, so we had to make like 3 trips to get water since we were dying.  Ok, now for the compliments.  The food was awesome! My mom and I really both loved our experience here, and the english muffins were delicious! My mom even bought a pack to take home with her, as she really enjoyed the food as much as i did.  I went with the eggs rancheros, and it was so tasty! I had never had it before and boy, did I clean my plate on this dish!  Fresh fruit came with it to, and the english muffin was tasty with what appeared to be home made jelly.  My mom went with some pancakes, I think and she loved them as well.  Overall, a tasty place and I would gladly return in the future!",

But our dining couple friends had heard good things about LGO and wanted to try it and I figured, okay, there will be something other than pizza...  Well, there really wasn't anything else that tickled my fancy, so I ended up ordering a pie.  All I can say is: wow!  Well, actually, first of all, we started off with salads.  One couple split a Caesar and the other a Caprese.  Fresh, delicious, yum!  THEN came the pies.  One set of us ordered a Margherita, the other a Margherita and a Gladiator, and the third couple a Gladiator and a Mother Earth.  Can I just say all pies were devoured?    I got the Mother Earth, which was loaded with green & black olives, artichokes, roasted peppers, broccolini, mushrooms, tomatoes, fennel, and onion.  The crust was very crispy and very thin---practically non-existent, just as I requested. Uctuous cheese was high quality.  Veggies just right.  But seriously, I traded off a slice for one of the Margherita, and that's what I would order next time.  Just cheese, tomatoes and fresh basil.  Pure, simple goodness.  I had a bite of DH's Gladiator---it was okay---I think I am maybe not a meat-lover-pizza person.  I was DD, so I had ice tea.  It wa a bit odd tasting.  On reflection, maybe it has a hint of orange-y flavor (La Grande ORANGE, after all)?  It was okay after I got used to the taste.  But I would like to have been warned.  First taste, I was like: Eeeew...Phoenix city water flavor?  Then I realized it was kind of a fruit-taste.  Except for never offering me a re-fill on my ice tea, our server, Madison was very good---attentive, personable, informative, and she's the one who made sure I got my practically crustless pizza!  Cute hair-cut too!  All our food came out fast and hot, except for the salads, which were cold and crisp!  Anyhow, I can see why LGO has 4.5 stars.  Very good.  If I were to trek south for pizza again---and I think that may happen, because everyone was so happy with their meals---I would probably do it for LGO.",

Take note that valet parking is likely what you will have to do if you come during busy lunch rush or weekend dinner hours because self parking is limited but it's not the end of the world.

    "text": "**La Grande Orange Pizzeria is attached to La Grande Orange Grocery**  As a first timer, the way in which to do things here was slightly confusing but here's the gist: 1) Place and pay your food order at the LGO Grocery. Their menu offers pizza,       salads, burgers, and drinks. Gelato and pastries are also available for dessert.          In addition to made-to-order food, there are pre-packaged salads and        sandwiches available for purchase at the LGO Grocery.  2) If eating there, find your own table outside or in the adjoining LGO Pizzeria      which has the pizza oven visible to anyone seated in the room so you can watch      the cooks make your pizza if you so desire.  3) Once you find a table wait for one of the cooks to yel and I mean literally yell out            your name.  4) Pick up your pizza, return to the table, and enjoy!  So after a full morning of visiting the Desert Botanical Garden, lunching at Chelsea's Kitchen, and shopping at Biltmore Fashion Plaza me and my friend worked up a small appetite and agreed to share a pizza at LGO Pizzeria.   We shared the mushroom pizza which may sound like a regular pizza you can get at any Pizza Hut or Dominos.  HOWEVER the \"Mushroom Party\" pizza at LGO is anything but a regular mushroom pizza. Just the playful name alone: \"Mushroom Party\" suggests that you'll have a great time eating it. If you're not a fan of mushrooms don't get this pizza; but f you're like me and absou-freaking-lutely love mushrooms get this pizza!  The \"Mushroom Party\" includes a combination of crimini, oyster, and button mushrooms with onion and fennel.   The different types of mushrooms used, added to the taste and texture of the pizza. The onion and fennel gave the pizza a bit of tartness and sweetness and a bit of crunch. The sourdough crust also added another layer of flavor to the pizza.  The combination of all these factors definitely elevated the pizza from just being another basic mushroom pizza. We easily finished the pizza and each had 4 small, but filling, slices. At $15 it was a fair price for a quality, made-to-order pizza.",

    "text": "La Grande Orange - LGO - The Big O  LGO is one of the best places for breakfast in Phoenix.  Recently, I visited LGO for brunch and I am so glad I did. I have found a new favorite restaurant when I want to grab a pizza, sandwich, or delicious sweet treat.    You can't help from noticing the long line of patrons gathering for their morning fix at La Grande Orange, but don't let the crowd discourage you, LGO is worth the wait . Parking at LGO can be a challenge.  However, valet service is available.  LGO has a hip vibe with a cafe/local maket feel. The staff at LGO are very accommodating in helping you find exactly what your looking for.  Give yourself some extra time to browse while at LGO, there are various trinkets and goodies.  You'll find so many interesting gifts and items for yourself or a friend.    On this visit we started off with salads.  A Caesar and  a Caprese.  The salads were fresh, crispy,  and delicious. After our salads came the pie. We  ordered a cheese and sausage, all I can say is the pie was  devoured.  The crust was very crispy and very thin. Just cheese, tomatoes, sausage, and fresh basil.  Pure, simple deliciousness. All our food came out fast and hot, except for the salads, which were cold and crisp.  I also purchased a chocolate croissant, chocolate scone, and a bag of LGO's famous English muffins to go. LGO's English muffins are amazing, and are  everything an English muffin should be. LGO's English muffins are soft and toast up perfectly for buttering. I don't recall ever having had an equal.  If your ever in the area, you should stop by and give LGO a try, you won't be disappointed.",

When I did eat the food though, even though the portions are smaller than what I would've liked, the margherita pizza was good. Not too oily. Slice was thin. Toppings tasted fresh. Would eat again.  Panini sandwiches were also good. Well toasted but not burnt. None of that sloppy dressing like chain sandwich shops. Everything was tidily kept in between the buns making it much more appetizing.  4/5 stars because the food was good, but it's too busy for the staff to explain to a newcomer what's going on in the store/restaurant. I wished they had informed me that I have to pick up the pizza myself on the other side of the restaurant instead of waiting over half an hour by the register where I picked up my sandwich.",

At all.   Also, the most un-friendly employee award goes to the cashiers at LGO. You either have to be a jerk to them for them to tone it down or get nothing but a \"too cool\" attitude. It's quite interesting.",

    "text": "I had the chance to try this place this past Saturday for lunch.  A friend and I shared a tuna nicoise salad, mushroom pizza, and a salted chocolate chip cookie.  All were very tasty. However, I brought some macarons home for my husband and I and I was a bit disappointed with these.  They didn't taste bad, but the texture just wasn't quite right.  It was also pretty busy when we were there.  Although our food was ready quickly, the set up of where you order and where you pick up the food could be arranged a little better.  I found it to be somewhat disjointed and it was a bit confusing.  Because this place is also a little shop, there are a few small aisles of body care, jewelry, t-shirts, gourmet cheeses, etc.  There is a little bit of everything.  They also have a counter dedicated to only serving coffee type drinks and a room that features a bar.  It's a unique place, as there is a hodge podge of things going on, but it works.  I recommend checking it out if you are in the area.",

I moved to Vietnam for over a year and thought about eating this pizza again at least once a week. And yes, I've had Pizzeria Bianco (both locations ok!), Federal, Forno... The thing about LGO pizza is that the sourdough crust is untouchable. It cannot be surpassed! I always order the margherita because it is pure and delicious and perfect, and I don't share. I've had Rocketman as well, which is super tasty, and everyone I know loves Mushroom Party but I don't like mushrooms :-( They also happen to have delicious cocktails, gelato, an amazing sea salt cookie (with gelato!!!), great grilled artichokes, and the awesome grocery right next door!   Servers are nice, service is fast, and I like all the music posters. It can be loud sometimes but that's because people are having fun! The only tiny thing I would change is to just have it be a bit brighter inside so I can see my beautiful pizza more clearly. I love you, please never close or change your recipe.",

We went with the Gladiator pizza to share.. wasn't too cheesy, not too sauce-y. The sausage had a nice bite to it and pepperoni was yummy. Crispy crust and loved the subtle notes of parmesan that came through with every bite. In addition, I also ordered the kale & quinoa salad with rotisserie chicken. WOW! Awesome salad and a solid portion. Loved how all the ingredients jived with one another and the cervil vinagrette dressing was like the cherry on top.   Great set up. I've been in the daytime for their grab-n-go section, and the ambience from day to night is almost a 180 degree difference. Romantic dim lighting (especially in the \"tasting room\" section in back) made for a wonderful setting for dinner. We grabbed a bottle of Malbec to pair with our dinner. For you wine-o's out there: they have a lovely selection of nicely-priced bottles available in the grocery section that they will uncork for you for no additional fee. Holla!  Before leaving, we checked out the grocery/store section..tons of fun, unique and quirky gifts. We also made a stop at the gelato counter. I really liked that they offered miniature portions - it was the perfect sweet cap to a fantastic dinner and experience.  Will return (again and again!)",

    "text": "First off, make sure your entire party is on time! They won't seat you until everyone arrives (not a bad thing, just an FYI).  So I get why this place is rated so highly. It's super cute with a mostly great staff (our waitress wasn't particularly warm, but I'll cut her a little slack because she was kinda busy and we were a big group). They have an adorable market next door and it has a great cute but casual ambiance. And they have free wine tasting while you wait for a table! Awesome :) However, I had a couple complaints.  1) I ordered a glass of red wine to start, the Pinot Noir. We had a large party (11) for a friends birthday and so I thought it would be simpler to order a glass than finding various people to split a bottle. After perusing the wine selection in the market, I expected it to be at least decent. It was not. Very much not decent, actually. And it was served almost luke-warm. I'm not sure if anyone has had poor quality wine served luke-warm, but it's disgusting. Next time I'm either getting a bottle from the market or sticking to the sangria.  2) I ordered the roast corn pizza (HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED) which was great. One of my friends ordered a Margharita Pizza and added proscuitto. Her pizza came out sans proscuitto. The waitress was apologetic and she took it back but when it came out, it was as if the kitchen grabbed a handful of proscuitto, through it on, and called it good. It wasn't cooked with the pizza and seemed incredibly half-assed.  Overall it was fine - I'd be willing to give it another shot, but my experience has a few flaws.",

The service is usually pretty good but last evening, our service was subpar. It took the bartender more than 5 minutes to greet us. Upon first greeting us she apologized and said she would grab us some water and be back to grab our drink order. The bartender returned about 10 minutes later, having not brought any water, and took our drink order. The service the rest of our meal was slow overall. The quickest service we got all night was the bartender grabbing my card when we were ready to pay. Once I swiped my card, the bartender grabbed the credit card machine hastily and walked away where she went back to cleaning glasses and complaining about how she was tired and wanted to go home. Overall, it was a lacking experience. Not sure we will be back again.",

I tried the Dali lama vegan pizza with House made vegan cashew cheese and it was the shizz! I'm going back to try everything else sub cashew cheese because it was that good! Can't wait to come back!",

I drove across the valley to eat here and my wife loves it but I'll stick to other places.  After speaking with the owner we took another shot at le grand orange.  There is nothing you can say about the parking except it sucks when it's busy but the food and service was great.  We will put it in our rotation when we can go outside of rush hour.  Thanks to the owner for his prompt address of my concerns.",

First of all, this area in the Arcadia district is loaded with some of the best eats in the Valley. Postinos had a long wait, so we hopped over and hit the bar area at LGO. I've actually never been in this part of the restaurant. It's small and intimate and wasn't overcrowded. My buddy and I had a great time hanging out here. We didn't order any food this time, but did order a few drinks. Our bartender Nicole really made our night. She was inviting, gave us some drink suggestions and was just a joy to have conversation with. I felt I found a new late evening option next time I'm in the area. This shows that great customer service goes a long way! My only gripe is parking is always a pain. Happy Hour is 4-6pm on weekdays and 12-6pm on weekends.",

Let me tell you, the place was packed.  The line to order moved quickly and I sat at the bar and watched football until my order was ready.  The green chile burger was amazing. The meat was cooked perfectly and the green chiles had just the right amount of heat.  I usually just eat half of a big burger and take the rest home when I go out but I wolfed this burger down in one sitting.  The ordering process and waiting for them to call your name when the food is ready is a little cumbersome.  Parking can also be a challenge.",

Then when we get home to eat the pizza it's been cold, we only live 5-10 min away from LGO.  I don't think you should have to reheat pizza after ordering carry out.  We called last time and they said it had just come out of the oven, but hard to believe.  Hopefully they get their act together but we'll be staying away for awhile!",

If you're vegan, they have vegan cheese you can get on their pizzas that I hear is the best around. Their normal pizzas, wings, burger, commuter sandwich...seriously, everything is delicious.",

I love eating here because with a gluten allergy they have the BEST gluten free crust and pizza I have had the honor experienced!  The crust is a crisp thin delight that highlights the flavors of your chosen toppings. I highly suggest trying everything they offer, it is all delicious. I do, however, consistently add sausage as an add on to the topping because I have a weakness for it. Enjoy!",

The smoked salmon salad is perfect to grab on your way out for a quick to-go lunch full of protein-rich sustenance and a perfect dressing. And for dinner? Oh man, the pizza. I love the avocado pizza, and adding the prosciutto is an absolute must. The creamy avocado with the salty prosciutto and little hint of lemon with the cheese and crispy crust is just to die for. I love it. The appetizers are perfect too - especially the dip trio (the cheese dip!) and the wings.   Skip over to the bar for a happy hour cocktail, grab a gift for a friend in the shop, make a cheese plate and grab some wine in the grocery, grab some dessert to enjoy at home (don't skip the gelato - or the pudding, or the red velvet cake...) - this place is wonderful.

I know that LGO gets good reviews, but WHY?????  The parking lot is a cluster and the \"complimentary\" valet is a hassle. I wait on both ends.....dropping off the car, and getting the one person valet to retrieve my car. There goes 15 minutes out of my lunch hour. I wish they'd just let us self park.   Placing an order for food is equally frustrating as people are bumping into you and squeezing by you to get around a bunch of tables with overpriced gift items on them.  What the heck?  Get that junk out of there and make it a more pleasant experience for the customer!  There is even less elbow room where you go stand to pick up your order. Even the employees can't get through and do their jobs. They are carrying hot food and trying to jockey around the customers.  Such a no brainer!  Now to the food.......lunch portions are SKIMPY to say the least. A $9 pulled pork sandwich looks like a slider, and there are no sides with the sandwich. My $10 Hot Sammy sandwich was about an inch thick with barely any meat on it. Again, no sides come with the order.   Such a disappointing experience on all levels. SO many better places to go in that area!  SKIP THIS ONE!",

Sorry, I'm super nerdy about this stuff.  Anyways, the sourdough crust is my favorite pizza crust in all the land. I love the flavor and how it's always glistening with oil when it comes to the table. The toppings are really special here. If you even remotely like avocado, get their avocado pizza. The lemon zest puts it over the top. The corn with goat cheese is my next favorite. The only one that I haven't liked is the the rocket man. It tasted fine, but the heavy toppings were too much for the thin crust.  We also had the fortune of trying their grilled artichoke appetizer one evening. I couldn't get enough of it! It's not on the menu (seasonal item I'm sure), but we asked about it when we saw plates of it go by.  Extra bonus points for the large selection of cheap pizza wines. Any time I can get a decent bottle at a restaurant for under $20, I'm a happy camper.",

    "text": "Was looking for a nice place to try some local pizza place, and found this on yelp.  Its a nice little setup where theres a small store next door.  We were just wanting to try some options, so we opted for the mushroom party and the gladiator as options for our one pizza.  What can we say but yummerific.  Very nice and light dough.  It was airy and the flavors were spot on.  They did not bury the pizza with pounds of tops, but allowed one to enjoy the entire flavor of the pizza itself.    Definitely would recommend this local spot to try.  It has an ambiance about it that makes it feel very causal, and you can hang out and lounge.  The only downside is their alcohol selection in that not much to choose from.    If your in the area, surely stop by and try their pizza, its not huge in portion, but good in flavor and that sometimes is just as good.",

Their pizza was incredible! Crispy, perfect crust, brushed with butter or olive oil and a hint of garlic, topped with fresh ingredients. The burgers we got were ok...I had the veggie burger (made with quinoa) and felt that the burger itself needed a bit more spice or flavor. The fries, however, were some of the best I have ever had. A mountain of crispy, fresh fries that were cooked in peanut oil and lightly dusted with a combination or seaonings and salt. And then...there was dessert. I got the red velvet cake and it was the BEST I have ever tasted. The cream cheese icing was decadent and light at the same time and the cake is self was unbelievably moist. I am from out of town but I will be hitting this place up the next time I am in Phoenix.",

My only problem with LGO's pizzeria is parking (or rather, lack thereof). This is especially True if you visit at peak-dinnertime hours.

It's great, but we could use a little menu change once in a while.

    "text": "I have been a great fan of the LGO since the very beginning-living just down the street. In fact, The whole LGO Phenomenon has made living in our hood a whole lot more interesting. I would say we are pretty much regulars both at the grocery and pizzeria.  I think I have probably tried everything on the pizzeria menu at one time or another with my favorites being the chicken wings, the orange fennel and spinach salad and of course the pizza. (Still prefer the fish sandwich the old way...) In the past year (or so) we had noticed a slight decline in the usually great vibe in the pizzeria. The food was lacking a bit of soul and the place just seemed to be getting tired. We went back last week and I noticed a difference right away. The place was mobbed-no big surprise-it was Saturday night-so we put our name in and proceeded to stand in our usual corner to wait it out. No more then 10 minutes went by and the manager apologized for the wait and offered us Sangria. Okay! What's not to like about that? 5 minutes later a server was offering us a slice of cheese pizza. Now, was that necessary? No. We would have waited patiently and people watched.  But was it classy, friendly, and neighborly? Yes! Do they need to do that every time-No. We consider this our neighborhood place and to feel welcomed like that was so nice. The service is usually great at LGO-casual but efficient-the way we like it. Personally, at a place like LGO, I don't care what servers are wearing-I really don't even notice-What I do care about is genuine hospitality. Cara, our server, brings that in spades. The food has its soul back and I love the new gelato look and the expanded dessert menu. I am so thankful LGO has stepped it up, (I suspect with a new manager) and a little reinvention. Maybe we'll see a new salad popping up in the near future?",

It was delicious and the novelty and combination of taste - AMAZING! Between the 3 of us, we ordered:  Mushroom pizza: Pretty good, lots of 'shrums for those who like mushrooms Corn and Avocado: Now that was delicious covered with chunks of goat cheese! I love goat cheese, tastes almost like cream cheese :) The Gladiator pizza: Pretty much an all meat pizza The Tomato and Basil: Yum  They even have vegetarian options for those who don't eat meat. It's a great late night snack. I don't usually eat the crust but they made it so well that I wasn't picky about it.   Oh, and we also ordered chicken wings - it was alright but I would say stick to the pizzas.",

The way the restaurant was laid out was quite confusing and I kept having to ask the employees there how to order, where to get drinks, and where they would call my name. The confusion lies in the fact that they let the grocery image of the business run front. I think that is silly since I heard about that via there pizza that should be there flagship business IMO. Anyway, back to the food it was good, but not better then pizza bianco, but I agree it is a nice place to take a date if its casual.

I actually drove past it the first time but was able to find it after a quick U-turn (legally of course!). The market is lovely with all kinds of things to look at, the bakery was stocked full of yummy goodies and breads galore! We were seated in the dining room and our waitress was very sweet and attentive.   After looking at the menu's, we noticed there wasn't much of a HH (only 2 wines for $5, $1 off cocktails and $2 beers). My friend and I ordered Sangria (OK I had 2) and thought it was quite tasty and full of fruit to nibble on afterwards. We split the smoked salmon salad, which was amazing! Perfect amount to split with someone because we also ordered the roasted corn pizza. Wow, the pizza was so good! I didn't think corn in a pizza would taste this good but it really does, as it was layered underneath the cheese and sourdough pie! Since we saw all the amazing bakery items beforehand, we had to order the Smore's cupcake (to split!). It was also incredible and rich, glad we split it!   I had a really great time and will be back! Delish!",

For lunch or dinner you can't go wrong with a sandwich or pizza. The drinks are great too. Can't go wrong with the latte with nut milk or the passion fruit iced tea. I just wish the candles they sell in the little market place were cheaper. 38$ a pop is a little rough",

My favorite pizza is the Mushroom Party - crimini, button, and oyster mushrooms. I'd like to try the Mother Earth because that sounds delicious (tons of vegetables) but that'll have to be next time. Their crust is both crispy and soft - a good combination. I haven't had any appetizers but they definitely have a large variety of items to choose from. If you are in the mood for pizza and want to try something different, this is going to be your new spot. Don't forget to valet!",

If you can get past the crazy long lines and sometimes blaring loud music at night, this place is the perfect pizza joint.

For dessert I got the chocolate chip gelato... SO good. probably the best Gelato I have ever had in the USA.  Second trip we made it past 4pm so we could try the pizza. duh. We ordered the baked wings to start and those were fantastic. They had a lot of meat on them and the sauce was great. Then we ordered a pizza to share. When they say it's for 2 people, they aren't kidding. We ordered the Cheese pizza (boring, I know, but it's my favorite) and the sourdough crust is what really sells this pizza. It has such a great flavor and texture. The blend of cheeses were also fantastic.  For dessert at dinner we got more gelato! chocolate chip and chocolate! The choco chip was just as good as the first time and the chocolate was also very good.  PS. Order your gelato in a waffle cone! Oh man, best waffle cone I have ever had. They throw in some cinnamon into the batter and it makes such a difference!",

The parking is usually impossible and often dangerously full of gargantuan SUVs and expensive sports cars.   There is valet parking available at times that is also overpriced, pretentious, and unnecessary. The parking lot is tiny and I need a valet to park my car? What a racket. Overflow parking is available on street in the bicycle lane (thanks a lot folks!)  I used to have coffee here in the mornings week-ends in the outdoor cafe', but the place has become a neighborhood nusiance. The orange caters to a clientele that largely appears to regard itself as quite UMC. Probably they should be located in Paradise Valley instead of eastern Phoenix.  I give it three stars because the food is good. That can't be disputed. The facilities and the company leave much to be desired though. If your idea of an enjoyable experience includes good food surrounded by SUV-driving soccer moms with ears adhered to cell phones, this place might just be for you.",

    "text": "As a break from studying for one of those standardized tests with a three or four letter abbreviation for a name, I decided to order a pizza for take away from La Grande Orange. After perusing the restaurant's simple and easy to navigate Web site, I decided on a margherita pizza with sausage. Upon ordering, I declined the what I will describe as \"carhop service.\" Why should I perpetuate the social alienation that automobiles and the urban design of Phoenix promote by taking advantage of such a service (and likely having to tip for it)?  Thirty minutes later, I arrived at the miniature stripmall. I'm sure many a yuppie have become enraged upon having their oversized SUV dented in the restaurant/grocer's small parking lot. I felt out of place in my 1999 Toyota Corolla (even with it being the \"luxury edition\"). I pondered if only individuals with a carbon footprint the size of Godzilla eat at La Grande Orange. I also wondered how pleasant it was for those \"dining in\" to sit with a view of SUVs and suburban sprawl in a building of little architectural merit.  First entering through the \"restaurant\" portion of the grocery, I stood for nearly five minutes with a look of confusion on my face as I watched high school-aged girls construct pizza boxes. I was assuming one of them would welcome me and ask me why I was here and how they could help me. That did not happen and I had to ask where I should pick up my pizza of my own initiative. I was directed to the nearby \"grocery,\" which was full of equal parts delicious looking breads and Halloween crap. In the \"grocery,\" I stood for another five minutes in one of three lines before I was finally directed to the right place to request my pizza. The girl I paid with was definitely unfriendly and borderline rude. Upon discovering she had no pen for me to sign my credit card slip, she went to retrieve one and then thrust it towards me with a \"Here!\" At this point, my frustration with the unfriendly staff combined with the realization that I had just paid more for my pizza at La Grande Orange (over $17) than I would have paid for a similar pie at Pizzeria Bianco to generate intense displeasure with the whole operation.  While I enjoyed my pizza and its unique sourdough crust upon consuming it at home (the ingredients were very fresh and I think I would like to try their avocado or roasted corn pies in the future), my general distaste for everything else about La Grande Orange (from price to staff to fellow patrons) will probably keep me from returning anytime soon.",

It's a little on the pricey side but that's expected for where/what it is.  One drawback...it seems to be valet parking for $3.  Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't.

I am embarrassed to say that last night was the first time I have been to the Pizzeria. Between lunch and dinner, I frequent the LGO market at least two or three times a week; and I know most of the crew at Postino - yet, I've never ventured into their world of pizza. That is, until last night.  We arrived around 5:45 and ordered a glass of the Rosso and Sangiovese and mulled over the menu. Because we weren't too terribly hungry we debated between the Gladiator and the Roasted Corn Pizza. When our server, Chris, overheard us, he told us they would gladly do half and half so that we can taste both. I was thrilled. When the pizzas came out they were great. The Gladiator is your more traditional style pizza and the Roasted Corn had such an refreshing unique merriment of flavors.   We finished by sharing a piece of the Red Velvet Cake. Seriously? I could have had another piece all by myself. Its six or seven thin layers of cake, moist and delicious, separated by an addicting cream cheese frosting that I kept looking for more of.   As we were getting ready to leave; I was admiring the pies that were on the table next to us. I was offered a piece of the Avocado Pizza. I never would have ordered it, and at first I declined, but she insisted, I was curious and I caved. Again, it was pretty good. Not sure I would eat a whole Avocado Pizza - but I loved the taster.  Rumor has it that the wings are pretty good...I have no reason to doubt that its True. Don't wait as long as I did to try LGO after dark.",

Go there aware of this, and you can still have a great time.  LGO is a pretty cool place that I suspect came out of nowhere and has since flooded the little corner it sits on.  It wholly deserves the attention, mind you, as that whole tiny plaza is awesome (this does consist of a gelato shop, LGO Pizza, and LGO Grocery).  The first stop on the trip was to LGO Pizzeria.  The place was packed even late into the dinner hour.  It was a Saturday, so this wasn't really shocking.  Luckily, we were able to sit at the long communal immediately.  This also meant we go to look right at all the delicious looking pizzas coming out of the oven.  Needless to say, we felt real hungry, real fast.  Wine was chosen from the enormous tome of options (they sell wine at retail from the LGO grocery next door) and a few wings ordered.  The wings that arrived were very, very, very good.  I'm not even a huge fan of wings and these were just spectacular.  Baked and quite probably marinated for hours, they just fell right off the bone.  The pizzas, when they arrived, looked as good as everything else that had passed up by.  The Avocado pizza was an interesting blend of light cheese, avocado, and lemon zest.  While the lemon balanced the avocado out well, it wasn't quite to my taste.  The Rocket Man, on the other hand, was good and spicy.  Actually, the two pizzas were both very complementary to one another and the experience of the meal definitely benefited from it.",

    "text": "My first experience @ LGO was w/much in trepidation.  I was a little intimidated.  My husband and I just drove from the Renaissance Faire and we're a little \"dusty\"  we didn't have one problem parking.  We walked up and put our name in and 10 minutes later we were sitting @ one of those cute tables in the very front of the restaurant for two people only.  Right by the window.  Our waitress was so uber.  She was so attentive and put all of my intimidation to rest.    We got the small order of chicken wings.  I read the description but this doesn't do it justice.  My husband hates onions and doesn't mind the chive ridden dipping sauce @ all.  We ordered the Gladiator.  Pepperoni and Sausage.  Delish.  It was so good.  Next time we will add mushrooms.  Everything was A+.  Even the Diet coke in a can delivered to our table was fantastically cold.",

Wish I lived closer because I'd probably head over once a week just for that amazing salad. Also ordered the green chili burger on the GIGANTIC English Muffin, which was tasty with a little kick. Ended the meal with a decadent salty n' sweet chocolate chip cookie from the adjacent bakery...and by then I was in a delightful food coma.",

    "text": "I am from Chicago and this is definitely my favorite place to go for pizza here in Arizona!  I'm also a huge fan of sourdough, so it is pretty perfect for me!!!  My favorite is the thin sausage pizza.  So yummy!!!  Parking is a pain and the wait staff isn't the friendliest.  I came in yesterday with my two daughters pretty early in the evening.  Our waitress picked up my daughters plate before she was even finished, cleaned up the entire table while we were still sitting there, and even took all the napkins.  I needed the napkins to wipe their hands after eating pizza...why would you take brand new, clean napkins away when I have two small kids with me?",

Just be patient, go early or late and pray for a good spot. Valet parking is a decent option. We have brought our 3 year old daughter there for dinner and she does okay for a toddler. We just promise her a gelato from next door. Actually, we end up buying the gelato and she eats that while we eat dinner and box up her meal for later.",

    "text": "After waiting for a parking spot with no results, I found a remote spot in the nearby neighborhoods.  Boo.  The wait was waaaaaaay too long, but I had an enjoyable time checking out the grocery store next door.  Ok, so pizza, wine, etc.  - not too bad.   But here's where it went wrong.  My ditsy waitress charged my credit card three times for my entire table's bill.  Then the ditsy manager couldn't fix it.  So I was then charged for my meal.  Hoping things went well.  Instead, my debit card was charged four times.  So I called back a few days later and the other ditsy manager gave me the run around, and refused to refund my credit card for the mistakes she and the other sorority girl made.  I was told to wait it out. I called back later on that week for a second opinion and received the same hurried answer from another manager.  Three weeks later, it disappeared from my bank statement.  I believe that a restaurant should be service that compliments their food. The food was ok. but not worth the hassle.",

    "text": "Given its location and surroundings (Postino's, fancy little grocery, etc), LGO is surprisingly casual inside, which I actually enjoyed.  There seemed to be a decent selection of wine (sorry, I didn't pay attention to the beer list) and if they don't have what you want, you can grab a bottle at the grocery and drink that.  I had the sangria, but didn't really love it.  The pizza though, oi, so yummy.  We had just cheese and sausage, and it was delicious.  I was a little iffy ordering sausage as I'm pretty picky about it, but it was great.  Had I not been trying to be a little ladylike, I could see myself scarfing down most of a whole pizza.   I also have bumped LGO to the top of my list of good places to take out of town guests, especially pickier eaters.  Who doesn't love pizza?  Update:  The roasted corn pizza is FANTASTIC.",
