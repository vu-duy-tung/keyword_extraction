    "text": "Alright,  back again.    Haven't visited since 2013.   This delightful English cafe sticks out amongst the breakfast choices across the entire northwest valley like the positive version of a sore thumb.    Around these parts there are 5 or so breakfast spots offering dissapointingly similar fare amidst a backdrop of barely consistent quasi-good table service. To prove that more culture and better food is desperately needed here, people stand around waiting an hour sometimes for a table at these tired,  dried up, cliche diners only to be served yesterday's specials,  at tomorrow's prices. During there wait the guests can be overheard discussing the good old days of breakfast buffets and church specials mostly unaware that downtown and in the east valley breakfast has been taken hostage by a growing amount of young, hip eateries offering delicious food. Those in the know from the west valley wake up early, strap their kids into their car seats with their sunglasses on to drive East. East into the sunrise and away from this grey, oppressive landscape up to 20 miles just to no longer be the victim of the West side breakfast blues  Alas,  Rayners to the rescue!   With their inventive menu, mom and pop service,  and delicious drink offerings this place is like the creative,  artistic sibling to the surrounding resteraunts that everyone in the family knows will move to New York and be really famous someday.    My sandwich had egg,  bacon and almonds.  It was slap your momma good.  My girl ate a bagel with a kaleidoscope of jalapeno lime jelly sausage goodness while we both shared a black raspberry lavender iced tea.   Seriously considering deleting this post because I don't want the word to get out and have to deal with the lines as the rest of you cardboard eaters finally get hip to the idea that you deserve better.",

I think if I were blindfolded, I could just pick a chocolate and I would be delightfully in heaven. This place is a gem.",

Completly hidden on 51st between Greenway and TBird is a gem of a coffee/chocolate/sandwich/breakfast place.  Run by the owners and serving up incredible food and genuine service.  Had the Unforgettable Bacon Hot Dog with  secial sauce (red onion, jalepeno, swee icle, green olives, , etc.)  Wrapped in bacon on a perfect stadium bun and it was awesome.  The Princess had the grilled chicken with feta and tasiki (?) sauce- she can't wait to go back.  We've already made plans with friends to check out the breakfasts.  They also have homemade pastries and handmade chocolates which are the real deal!  (They generously give first-timers a free piece of chocolate). Judging by the steady stream of customers at 2:30 on a Saturday, I'd say the word is getting out on this wonderful place.  They also have a great selection of British grocery items for sale.  Check it out, you won't be dissappointed.",

They have a full menu of breakfast and lunch items but I ordered one of the Scotch egg pasties out of the display cooler along with a lemon bar and Highland shortbread. That, with a large latte, was just over $12.   The pasty was pre-made and warmed in the oven so it came out fast and was so good. Very soft, perfectly baked pastry crust with a sprinkling of pepper and salt on top. The Scotch egg inside (hard-boiled egg wrapped in sausage) was delicious. The sausage was perfect and not at all greasy and the egg was cooked just right. The lemon bar was more of a type of lemon curd oat cake instead of just being the typical lemon-y gel stuff over graham cracker crust and was really good. I like that it was more hearty than your average lemon tart. The shortbread was a little harder than I like but has nutmeg and cinnamon in it and was great when I dipped it in a hot coffee I made myself later. The latte was great too. It wasn't anything special but wasn't too milky and the coffee wasn't bitter which is all too common in less-commercial coffee places. Just right.  You can see right into the chocolate-making area and there were a bunch of different types including these huge high heels made of chocolate. Really cool! I, unfortunately, didn't actually sample any of their chocolate but I'll be back for that sometime hopefully soon.  As I was in and eating, two different people came in and were obviously regular how they chatted with the owners. It was nice to have that real mom-and-pop-shop feeling there.  I definitely hope this place sticks around! I don't frequent this area of town but if I lived over there, I'd certainly be a regular.",

I have had the toffee mocha three times. It is chocolatey without being cloyingly sweet (in comparison to Starbucks). The owners are so nice and friendly. You feel like you are in their kitchen. We have had some food we liked and some we didn't. The Irish stew is good along with the Caesar salad and the pasties. All of the pastries are perfect. I did not really enjoy the porkys panini. Too salty and not enough balance of flavors. It also gave me heartburn for a week. The bacon nut was just a little too strange for me. Not gross, but would not get again. Bacon and slivered almonds on an egg sandwich?! We were not a fan of the breakfast sandwiches in general (most served on hamburger buns with mayo). On food alone, I would have rated 3 stars but the customer service and friendly people earn another star from me!",

Eric was very hospitable and connected with us right away.    The sausage gravy was the best I have had, and I'm very particular.  However, the biscuits a bit dry like a scone.  No big deal.  The turkey sandy was great too and the bacon is awesome.  They use low sodium bacon and start it in the oven then press it on a panini press and it is perfectly crispy/crunchy and not over done.    The coffee is decent but coming from a snob it isn't high on my list.  The many different flavors were a nice touch and gave me some options but being a purist at heart I want the coffee to take precedence not the added flavors.  I know how hard it is to pull a proper shot and flavors just cover it up.    Very friendly for children.  We brought our 15 month old daughter with us and everyone made us feel welcome.  They also have a bin full of stuff for kids to play with.  Don't worry, they said that they clean them every day.    Bottom line:  We will come back here to try more food.

My family and co-workers are slowly working our way through their offerings and absolutely everything is outstanding. I hope you get a chance to try Rayner's soon - you won't be sorry! BTW ASU students - they offer a Student Discount - sweet!",

I came in with my sister merely for the coffee and heard about this place on Yelp. It's amazing. Coffee selection is incredible. Fun neat drink selections. I had the Arizona delight not too sweet just enough coffee taste. It's wonderful. Also my sister had turtle mocha and she really liked it. I had an Italian puff pastry that was really good. I'm happy I came!  5 stars!",

    "text": "I almost don't want to write a review about this place because I want to keep it our neighborhood's best kept secret. They were recommended to me by my cousin who had been a couple times. They have obvious Scottish and Irish influence and this is a big draw for my family. I decided to try them out for lunch, ordered an iced chai latte and the ham and brie croissant sandwich special. Holy. Balls. The best chai I've ever had (and they'll make it dirty if you like), and I was honestly sad when the sandwich was gone. The owner and chocolatier was so friendly and offered me a free chocolate since it was my first time. She brought me the cinnamon rum milk chocolate. I don't typically like cinnamon chocolate but this was exceptional. I'll probably pick up a few of these specifically next time I go back. The other woman who came in had a lavender dark chocolate, which sounds delicious.   I also like that you can tell how fresh and homemade everything is, and they're not skimpy with the sandwich fillings. My sandwich was loaded with thick cut black forest ham and big hunks of brie. I also lime that they mayo both sides of the sandwich, it's the little things that count. I don't typically like ham either but this was well worth the gamble! I'm sooo soo sooo looking forward to going back!",

Cute and thoughtful decorated with a glass window to watch chocolates being made this is a special place.   Yahoo and Hurray ! I am thrilled to have a bakery that is tasty , homey and has great lunch tarts, salads,sandwiches and coffee!  Located near ASU west just north of Thunderbird , this quaint mom and pop bakery has the elements of a being a local haunt. Owners Pat and Tony Rayner have loads of chocolateriering and  baking experience and their display case shows it. Filled with tasty cookie bars, filled chocolates ( chocolate with goat cheese ? Yes please! ), pain au chocolate, big cookies and tarts .This is like a great back east bakery , And  the goodies are fresh and taste like the way you'd make it if you could . Did I mention they also have one of my downfalls  chocolate covered macaroons? It's so yummy! Prices are reasonable ,and the macarons are only a buck!   Now if that weren't enough they also have sandwiches and tarts that seemed European , maybe because Tony is was formerly a British baker? Lunch time treat ? Try the one of the salads with goat cheese and walnuts....mmmm.  Food can be take out or stop and eat at their sweet little tables.   Looks like they are well equipped for coffees, smoothies and other breakfast nicieties too.  Close to my work it  may become my new favorite.",

It is ground chorizo in a flavorful sauce with peppers and sour cream.   One of the best, if not the best, clam chowders I've ever had. You get bites of flavorful clams in every bite.   The lunch item I tried was the Greek chicken pita sandwich. I ordered when I came too late for breakfast and it's so much more than I expected. Tender chicken with spinach and a generous layer of yummy spread in a thick pita. Normally I don't like red onion but it works great. I should have saved half for later because after eating it, I fell in a food coma.   A while back I had another sandwich that I didn't like only because the cream cheese was thick and cold.I think I prefer the hot/warm sandwiches so it's up to preferences.  I wish I got some pictures but I ate it too quickly.",

I always try to frequent these little Mom & Pop kinda shops & this didn't necessarily disappoint but it wasn't the best I've ever been to. I ordered a raspberry danish & an iced coffee with salted caramel syrup.  It was just weak hot coffee poured over ice with maybe a tiny bit of the syrup. The pastry was great but as far as coming back because I need my coffee fix, I'll probably keep looking. I do look forward to trying more of the pastries because there were quite a few & they all looked scrumptious!",

We tried some of their chocolate which is absolutely fabulous. We have also been for breakfast, their biscuits and gravy are great, as is the \"I wonder\" egg dish they make with spinach. The place has wifi and is a very chill little place to sip on (very delicious and satisfying) coffee. They also sell what appears to be imported teas, jams, cookies and various perishable goods from the United Kingdom.   I would highly recommend this place for breakfast, brunch, lunch or just a good cup of joe!",

I insisted and told her that I also wanted to purchase some chocolate and buy coffee. She looked angry and barely spoke to me. She was so miserable just ringing my order up but she was all smiles towards my friend. I should have just walked out and never bought anything.",

I decided to stop by with my fiance, and I am so glad I did!  This gem of a bakery is tucked away just off of 51st Avenue and Thunderbird. They recently added more seating and it is surprisingly spacious. The owners are very kind, and I always receive great customer service when I'm there (which is a lot!).  Now, here are some of the things that I absolutely recommend:  Pain au chocolat Jujube anything - their tea is a little on the sweet side, but delicious All the handmade chocolates!!! (You get a free piece on your first visit!) Strawberry muffin Meringue Fresh fruit danishes Snickerdoodles - best I've ever had Brownies - very rich and chocolaty  Just try all that you can because everything is great!  The lunches are also a great value; it beats going to any fast food restaurant around town. I love the Greek chicken pita! Generous portions and fresh ingredients. My fiance likes the Shepherd's pie, and I like to steal bites, too!  This is definitely a place worth visiting. I just moved to Los Angeles and am missing it dearly.  Charming, quaint places like Rayner's remind me how important it is to support small, local businesses.",

If you're looking for a selection of both traditional and out of the ordinary fine chocolates and pastries, this is your place. If you're looking for popular British candies crackers and jams, this is your place. If you're looking for traditional British and American breakfast and lunch items, this is your place. I have been to numerous restaurants that were recommended by various restaurant finder phone apps. A good majority of them turned out to be a disappointment.

I'm not familiar with the roll that the bacon & egg sandwich comes on, but I'm pretty sure it literally melted in my mouth. U.K. flare with worldly goodies for purchase AND...AND!!!

    "text": "Well, where do I begin? We had visited before and received a free piece of chocolate for first timers. The chocolate was smooth and delightful. We promised to return for lunch one day. Well, Saturday was that day. We arrived and found the restaurant to be half full and rather quiet. We were asked by the clerk if we wanted to take out or dine in. We decided to eat there and sat at a table near the window.  Let me say this before anything else. The smells from this place are fantastic. Fresh baked sweets, rolls, pies, soups.....wow. Utopia for your nose. We ordered a few coffee iced drinks and our main dishes. I had the Cornish patsie (beef pie) and the wife had a turkey sandwich with bacon and no mayo. Here's where it went south a bit. The turkey sandwich, while perfectly prepared, was rather flavorless. The lack of mayo made it necessary to find other condiments to liven up the sandwich. While the sandwich was OK...my patsie was delicious. The beef was flavorful and the salad had fresh, crisp veggies. The iced coffee drinks were probably the biggest disappointments. The syrups added presented a \"fake\" taste that ruined the beverage quality overall. My wife ordered a second beverage in exchange for the first and after a quick apology by the clerk we had a new drink on the way with no hassle. Great customer service! The desserts were our second conquest. Let's just say that after ordering the bread pudding I took some to go after I checked out. Lol. It was a spiced cake style of bread pudding. Very tasty. Overall, 2 drinks, 2 main dishes, 3 desserts and great service was about 35 bucks. I will be frequenting this place in the future.  As for the hiccups, don't forget that you don't need to bat 1,000 to make the All Star Game.",

This friendly but very small place also sells some hard to find British dry goods. Some of the breakfast and lunch specialties are, English Style breakfast,  Cornish Pasty and Cotswold Pie.   We shared two of the lunches. The pasty had a very tender crust and was filled with tasty ground beef and vegetables. This meal came with a very large fresh regular salad.   The sandwich named, \"Best Grilled Cheese Ever\" Turned out to be the best tasting Vegetable with cheese sandwich I ever had! This sandwich was more vegetables than cheese but was on  tasty, nicely toasted white rye bread. This sandwich also was made with tasty sauces that just made it delicious.  Had to share a dessert so I picked the double baked almond croissant because I never seen a dessert like that before. It was made of many light layers of pastry, stuffed with an almond cream and topped with more decadence,  It was a very rich dessert but was masterfully made.  As we were leaving the server INSISTED we try a chocolate since we never were here before. I picked the milk chocolate with macadamia nuts. The chocolate was very creamy and delicious and so smooth. I won't be able to eat store bought chocolates now after Rayner's Chocolate.  What a Treat!  You should Check Rayner's out if you can!",

I went initially looking for something chocolate for my SO, so I got a triple chocolate mousse  (i didn't pay attention to the names) and a chocolate pyramid too. And noticed that they also had some fabulous sounding lattes and sandwiches,  so I ordered some for me,  both fantastic (i forget which iced  latte,  but I had ham sandwich with a raspberry spread ) .  While eating I felt bad not taking some pastries for my kids and dad,  so,  a couple of bear claws and chocolate croissants later, I finally left. Everyone at home loved everything I got,  and since my lunch was great too, I'm looking forward to another trip.  Maybe I can get there early enough to try breakfast,  which looked just as amazing",

There is a unique flavor every month or so decided by the owner of Rayner's. The chocolates are very delicious and I would definitely recommend giving it a try.

Then, for our meals my wife had the Emily (eggs, capers and spinach on a telera roll), and I went the opposite (aka meaty) direction and ordered Porky's panini (pork patties and bacon smothered in the \"biscuits and gravy\" gravy  put between delicious bread and then placed in a panini press). We enjoyed both items.   We were both full and happy after that. But, you can't leave Rayner's without a truffle or pastry. We each sampled the goat cheese and dates dark chocolate truffle and the fresh plum puff. The truffle was creamy chocolate, decadent, deliciousness and the puff was light, flaky, and fruity.   This is a gem in the fabric of the west valley. Don't pass it by.",

We were greeted by Eric who was our server and he gave us the back round of this great little place.  It has been here almost 5 years, the chef is from England and puts a European spin on a lot of the dishes.  They have quite the menu and they also have a separate menu with daily specials on it, if something catches your eye order off that, you may not get to again for some time!  That is exactly what I did I had the pork loin sandwich with pineapple salsa and it was Goooood!  My wife had what Eric called the \"Thanksgiving\" sandwich she enjoyed it but had to take some cranberries off it cause there were so many on there.  The prices are good and portions that you won't leave hungry, and the deserts are extraordinary as well are their lattes!  OH, forgot to tell you, they make homemade chocolate on site! MMMMMM!!!  Heading back for Sunday brunch to try the Monte Cristo sandwich!",

We have since moved, but Rayner's has not been replaced.   What is great about Rayner's? Everything. I am not stretching the truth. Their breakfast and lunch food are unique and outstanding. My wife loves their flavored coffee. I always get the China Mist Iced Tea.  Their pastries are too good, so it is hard to decide what to get. Do you like chocolate? If you do, this is also your place.  Finally, we love it because of the atmosphere.  Everyone that works there truly cares about the customers. You can tell this is more than a job for all of them.  If we were allowed to eat at one place in the world, this would be it.  Selfishly, I hated writing this review.  I love having OUR place, but such a place should be EVERYONE'S place.

The Coffee Jolt cookie was incredible with spicy dark tones.  The short bread full of buttery goodness like it should be. Now  the surprise...The coffee - WONDERFUL! It even impressed me; the greatest coffee snob of all.  I cant wait to try their lunches.  Hurry in before everyone else finds out and you can't get a seat in this perfectly decorated cozy little shop. Look for the yellow sign north of T-bird on 51st Ave.",

    "text": "I understand that I am in the minority here with my strongly negative review of Reynor's,  but I will persist. I patronize this place when it first opened; for a while, it seemed that I was her only customer. It has since become extremely successful and popular. However their food offerings, while very good, are markedly overpriced. The products that they sell that are British imports are even more overpriced. They are also extremely haughty. Example:  their walls are adorned with original artwork by local painters. Pat, the front manager and her husband chef Tony, take 25% of each of the prices marked on those paintings for the privilege of showing them to patrons. This ought to be an affront to the sincere artists who create these artworks. In other words, the place has become a money pit. I urge you not to patronize this place simply in order to make yourself feel important. It's a disgrace. By the way, I am retired ASU faculty. I hold three Masters degrees and a doctorate. I'm not a fool. My assessment above his reasoned.  there are plenty of other striving, family - owned establishments in our community who will treat you graciously and satisfy your taste buds and you deserve your patronage. This one does not.",

    "text": "Finally! An exceptional bakery and coffee shop in the West Valley! The place is fairly hidden, in a non-descript  strip mall on the east side of  51st Ave just north of Thunderbird but worth the effort. Their coffee is exceptional but my current fav is an iced Jujube fruit and black tea. I'm addicted. We're eating our way through their pastries; the croissants remind me of the ones I enjoyed in France. And their homemade chocolate-dipped biscotti  and Meringues (both Pistachio and Strawberry) are heavenly. There is a very particular German woman at work who gave very high marks to their Pear Financier Tarts (us too). And don't ignore their sandwiches and salads. They have a build-your-own sandwich for $5.25 that puts to shame the same sandwich with much lower quality ingredient at Sprouts for$ 2.99. And where else can you get handmade chocolate stilettos (for real)! We are delighted to finally have this level of quality in the bakery coffee and chocolate department on our side of town.",

I had the inaptly-named \"Breakfast of champions\" which comprised of scrambled egg of multiple colours (the white and yolk were not mixed properly), a few pieces of bacon that were glued together and two pieces of half toasted white bread.  The worst thing was that this came on a plastic plate with plastic knife and fork!! How can a place call itself a restaurant if you serve meals on plastic?  Will not be back.",

I walked in ready to order and the new owner says \" Did you really just walk in here with a Starbucks coffee?\" I thought she was kidding around because I know it's also a coffee shop but I didn't bring my Starbucks in to offend them simply for it not to melt in the 107degree car outside. I mean how long would it take to get breakfast to go? She then tells me that there is a law that you cannot bring outside drinks into any Establishment in AZ. I don't know if that's True but the waitress looks at me and asks if I would like breakfast and I say yes and the new owner was not having it. Very rudly she and another employee tell me that I should try their coffee. I just bought a $5 cup of coffee I'm not going to throw it away. She told me I could only get food to go. That was the plan but I've never been treated so rudely in my Life by an Establishment so I left. I won't promote a business that treats people that way. I was also the only one there. Don't waste your time going here. The old owners were amazing people and so kind. Sad that their legacy is ruined.",

Their chicken is probably a 7/10, but their beef cornish pasty is a solid 10/10 and probably what they're best known for. Their buscuits and gravy is loaded with hearty pieces of chunky meat that makes it so worth it.   They also have a very delectable selection of pastries and in-house made chocolate with a variety of additions such as orange, almonds, blueberries and caramel. Their chocolate is very good.   The staff here is very welcoming and happy to help in any way.

I'm eager to see how the new owner brings her own touches all while continuing to run the Rayner's we know & love.

My niece and I visited Rayner's and almost right away decided that we would return the next day to try more of their pastries. Pat Rayner was kind enough to let us sample a couple of their chocolates - a Valentine chocolate lollipop for my niece and a dark chocolate bar sprinkled with candied ginger for me - and also gave my toddler son a delicious Italian shortbread cookie! Such a lovely idea to let your patrons sample an array of your products. We purchased a sandwich (the turkey avocado with bacon was delicious and made with quality ingredients), a custard pastry, and the to-die-for double baked almond croissants.   Rayner's also has a fun selection of flavored lattes, some named after customers who came up with the flavor combos. I tried an iced Elvis Latte (chocolate, PB, and banana) during my first visit and a Benjamin (dark mocha with orange) the next day.   Will definitely be back!",

    "text": "It's with heavy heart I am giving them three stars. I really wanted this to be a regular stop for me, but sadly, I can drive past and not think twice.   The cafe is tucked away in a small strip center. The street signage is small and easily missed. The store front signage  is also lost; a \"coffee shop\" and \"bakery\" sign are affixed the roof line of the building and a white decal  of a crest and name adorn a window.  With a name containing the word \"chocolate\", one would expect to be walking into a room full of \"eye candy\". That's not the case here. Upon walking in , there's  a glass front case that contains about a dozen pasties and small tray of truffles and two small trays of batch nut coated chocolates. They also have a menu with breakfast and lunch items. In an adjoining room the have a small assortment of European grocery items for sale. ...So immediately, there's an identity crisis.   We were kindly greeted at the door by an older gentleman with a colorful sock. He asked if we would be dining in. We explained that we had a limited amount of time and if he thought we could be served promptly. The gentleman assured us we would be able to be served and eat with the time we had left.   We decided to get a latte and lunch. My lunch buddy and I ordered one of the latte that had mocha and marshmallow (forgot the name) it was ok, a bit too sweet for me.  For lunch we were going to each order an item and split; I ordered the Cornish pasty and she ordered the Cottswold Pie. Both came with a side salad. The pie and the pasty were insipid. The peas in the pasty were they only flavor. The Cottswold pie only had slight flavor of Cottswold cheese. We both ate our lunch pies, but as we sat there we quickly realized that we were going to be feeling our lunch for a while. It sat like a brick.   The gentleman was so sweet and concerned if we were going to be back on time. He also gave us a chocolate before we left.   The cafe is decorated in a granny fashion , classical music overhead and appears to be popular with many senior citizens. The average age while we were there must have been about 65. The establishment is clean and the service is exceptional. Unfortunately for me, the food was too bland to make me want to visit again.",

Then I picked up a menu and she took it out of my hand and told me to take a different menu because that was the menu of the day and she only had a certain amount. It seemed like there were plenty. It seemed as if she was afraid that if she smiled the plaster may brake. So rude!",

When I called around and finally reached Rayner's the woman that answered the phone immediately answered all my questions and was very knowledgable about all the ingrediants used in each chocolate. The hotel will be picking up my order, but on product knowledge, quality ingrediants, and customer service alone I give them top marks. I hope when I see my friend she will share a chocolate or two so I can actually try these mouth watering creations!",

The lady behind the counter was very gracious and let me sample a piece of dark chocolate with an espresso cream filling. It was exquisite. I then bought a cappuccino wet and a muffin which I believe was cinnamon streusel. Hands the best cappuccino I've ever had and the muffin was so moist and the streusel added the perfect amount of richness and flavor. Excited to try they're large variety of coffees and teas as well as they're breakfast dishes and pastries.",

The owners work the register and the other is the chef, and are super friendly and clearly take pride in their establishment. I would have given them five stars in a heart beat (and I wish I could have given them four and a half stars) but they didn't offer skim milk as an option for the coffee drinks. Not a huge deal at all but it's what I like. Oh well, black coffee was just fine with me. A nice change up from the chain coffee shops.",

The feeling was just happy and homey. The pastries rival what I tasted in Europe, and my savory biscuit breakfast sandwich tempted me to order a second (which would have triply killed my diet). I was delighted to see they sell truly Briton fares, and I not only have some PT's tips, I also have a new box of Builder's tea to cut my teeth on Monday through Friday to save myself from sad corporate coffee. Builder's is not a pansy tea, no way, this is the stuff of the makings of that enviable strong, upper lip of the quintessential Brit that we Americans somehow lost in our independence.

I went with grapes (a whopping 9 of them, I counted). The sandwich was honestly pretty mediocre and I didn't finish it. I tasted their version of a croque monsieur and it was basically a panini pressed ham sandwich with ham so tough you couldn't chew through it. Our server was nice, but painfully new at her job, but that was ok. Honestly, I don't know what all the hype is about. Maybe we just caught them on an off day but the cost versus the food makes this a no go for me.",

My mom grew up in Malaysia and a lot of British baking, so when I brought home a batch of the raisin scones from here, she was sold. She said it reminded her of when she was a kid. As far as coffee, it's always just perfect for me! It's never too sweet when I get a fancier drink and the plain coffee is always nice and strong. I definitely recommend the lavender, blackberry, white chocolate latte or the Amazonian latte. It's the perfect pick-me-up!  I've had a couple of breakfasts and lunches here and I think it's just right. There are good flavors and portions. It's never too heavy and a good one to get you through the afternoon. I enjoy being here for studying too. It's a good between of not being too loud and packed or too quiet and stale.   In terms of service, I have yet to have a single bad experience. The people are always so kind and helpful. It's the type of place where they try to remember your name, especially if you come in often. They also have some good recommendations.",

The only thing really saving this review is the great service and the bomb Snickerdoodle cookie we got. We were greeted by a really nice lively young woman who got to us right away, crafted us some decent coffee's, and took our orders, what we got after that was what I feel a day's old meal from Jail might be like. Please see my pictures. Egg's were old, had zero taste, and were sponge like. The bacon was... well I don't even know if it was bacon. There was no fat, no juices, no sign of life to whatever piece of 5 day old jerky I was given. I will say the biscuits and gravy were pretty good. I believe that might be the only thing they made fresh that day. I don't know if they lady with the buzzed hair cut is usually the cook but she was the cook that day. I would like to come back and give this place another shot on the case that they were just having an off day.",

The place is just a mismatched nightmare service was not good, the food was horrible, and served on a plastic plate with plastic utensils! On top of that our simple breakfast cost us $21! The scrambled eggs were gray and yellow as if they had been cooked on a dirty grill or dirty skillet the bacon was so cold and hard it was unedible and the toast was so cold the butter wouldn't even melt. Other than the tea there was nothing UK about this place. I would highly recommend you not go there! Overpriced, cold food, horrible experience!",

It is obvious that she cares for her customers and I hope to be able to visit more often and eventually become a regular.  Hubby ordered the same thing he had last time - the English sandwich and Peanut butter latte.  I wanted to try something new this time and ordered the Irish sandwich and Cinnamon bun latte.  The cinnamon bun latte does have an obvious cinnamon flavor to it and it was just sweet enough.  The menu describes the Irish sandwich as having caramelized onions as part of the composition but it was missing completely from mine.  Caramelized onions are one of my favorite food things but although it was missing, this was still an incredibly tasty and filling sandwich that I would order again.  Until next time!",

The quantity was about a grande at Starbucks. I had an iced hazelnut mocha, which was not the best I've ever had yet fairly decent as a whole. We tried their Rayner's Bacon Dog on the lunch special menu. It was delicious. The bun was not your typical hotdog bun, more like a toasted baguette; the bacon was crispy. They had just the right amount of sauerkraut.   The best part was getting free handmade chocolate since it was our first time. We got dark chocolate with hazelnut and macadamia nut. The chocolate had this bitter salty taste that goes very well with the nuts we chose.",

The owners are extremely friendly and interesting people who are more than willing to have a great conversation. I can't think of a better place for lunch anywhere -- let alone Phoenix. This place is truly a treasure.",

Since we didn't eat there we stood and waited for out food and coffee. We decided to buy some of the chocolates. Since I am currently full I will have to update after chocolate consumption.  It is a quaint little shop with some amazing greeting cards and a lot of eye candy on the walls. If you are in the neighborhood stop by and try it.",

The little market was a little piece of nostalgia for me and brought up many great memories from childhood. Definitely a splurge breakfast that was completely worth it. Now, on to my breakfast review:  1) Cinnamon bun latte, cappuccino style: the first words out of my mouth were \"this is the best cappuccino I've ever had\"  2) Creme brule bread pudding: not typically a fan of bread pudding, this was the best. Eat the middle for that typical \"gooey bread pudding\" consistency. It's fantastic 3) Porky's Panini: NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART! If you're not scared to get a little messy and a lot of gravy everywhere, this sandwich is for you! I asked Pat if next time I could just have a loaf of sourdough and a bowl of gravy because that would just make my world complete.  4) Monte Cristo: your typical delicious Monte on sourdough. Really classic, really delicious.   Overall, wonderful place to sit and enjoy a quiet and quite fantastic meal in a place that feels like home. Plus the free truffle for first-timers will convince you that you should try them all.",

The store kinda wants to have this little European flair I guess...it wins in the pastry area, but not necessarily in the overall atmosphere.  Once inside, you will find a tasty display of some remarkable pastries including croissants, dry cookies, tarts etc..... In addition,  Rayner's also offers snacks and sandwiches. And if this is your first time visiting the store, they will offer you a complimentary chocolate.  Very nice staff - and there are also some shelves stocked with European goodies, even some candy bars I grew up with including Smarties Yeah!  The coffee is delightful. Thanks to Yelp - I found this place just looking for Espresso and  was pointed in Rayner's direction.",

Handmade pastries and chocolates!! We ended up buying way more than we expected because everything looked and WAS so delicious. The owner helped us by explaining each different chocolate and even gave us a free taste (TIP: if its your first time they give you a free sample:) it was a little slow but that was only because they spent so much time and attention on us, which is a huge plus in comparison to all those big busy coffee shops that rush you through. Needless to say it was difficult to leave but alas California was calling us...but we at least had some delicious treats for our trip home!",

Traditional British/French pastries, chocolates to die for and a complete selection of British/Scottish grocery items! And the really great coffee/espresso beverage selection is so comprehensive! They have special recipie drinks or just get your usual late. We got so much to take home (chocolate croissants anyone?) and will be back soon for my iced Mocha Late and my husband's sugar free iced vanilla late.",

It's little mom and pop kind of place, not much decor, and no restroom, but the food was completely worth it. Also our server was very friendly and made sure our drinks were always filled.   Highly recommend giving this place a try, we are excited to go back and try some other items.",

They are oh so good. For first timer, they offer free sample of chocolate so make sure to ask for one. Pastries are baked fresh everyday. My hubby had a sausage breakfast sandwich with customized bread and it was a winner! Service was first class-- no question, 5 stars! Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "What can I say but WoW! My wife recently read about this place in the paper.  If you did not know it was there you would probably never find this place. It is situated off 51 ave. just north of Thunderbird.There is a strip of stores that run east and west and they are situated about half way down this strip of stores.  When I walked through the door I knew immediately I would like this place.  My wife and I shared a pastry and a couple of short bread cookies. Don't ask the names we just picked what we thought would be a good selection for a first visit. OH! You get a piece of chocolate free on your first visit.  I did not look at a menu but saw some of the specials posted on the walls. Now I am planning a trip soon to have breakfast.  Decoration is for me hard to describe. Comfortable, friendly, clean, a place to meet a friend for breakfast or lunch, not just once but many times. There are two separate rooms where you can sit and eat plus outside. In the room we were in there was a wall with many different foods from England.  Even though they were very busy the owner and one of the helpers took time to talk to us.  Everything we had was very good. Or what I should say much better than good.  Give them a try. I know you will be as impressed as I was.",

We were asked if we were given free chocolates the first time we were there but we didn't. Apparently you get a free chocolate the first time you visit! My husband and I love the dark chocolates! Thank you!!!  A few months ago, around Halloween-ish, we went here after my son's basketball game and got a bunch of goodies and latte! We ordered a few chocolate eye balls and some pastries!  This place has amazing pastries (I forgot the names) chocolates and lattes! We haven't had the chance to try their breakfast and lunch menu but we will surely be back!  To top it all off, service is incomparable to anything! Everyone is so nice - even the other customers (seriously, we were greeted by a customer!)! We highly recommend!",
