I was expecting a sit-down-and-order experience, but was wrong and I've talked to others who've thought the same thing (there are places to sit it's just more like a deli than a restaurant). Still, that shouldn't put you off...they make great sandwiches and on Mondays they have GREAT lunch specials!  Sometimes there is live music, which is real nice (especially if the performer is attractive and sometimes they are).  When I go I usually order the Avacado Sandwich or the Briesciutto.",

They will make sandwiches however you want them, and the ingredients are always super fresh.  They have lots of cozy, private places to sit inside and outside.  For me, it is an Arizona landmark.  I drive here 45 minutes each way about once a month just to enjoy the good eats and atmosphere with my friends.",

Couldn't possibly look at everything they have to offer in the short wait for our food, but will definately make another trip here soon!  Many many many products from all over the world along with over 60 International cheeses to choose from!  Great choices in salads and sandwiches along with anything you want to drink or take it with you!  This place is exceptional and can be very overwhelming on your first visit, but you can easily change around anything you want from the bread to the condiments and add any kind of cheese you could possibly think of!    Yes it is a little odd to get to the first time and yes there is a parking lot next to this place, but it has been there for over 35 years - so I'm betting GNC, Sports Authority or Einsteins (ugh - the worst!) was even a thought when this place was built, besides after you enter their lovely patio you completely forget about all of that!  It's better than I ever imagined and we are both ready to go back and try more!  We can't believe it's taken us this long to visit this place and now we are sorry we waited, what a great find!  If you live in the valley you owe it to yourself to try The Duck!  As for the people who say expensive - I don't know where they are eating but this is very reasonable, especially for this quality of food!  Cheese lovers delight!!!",

    "text": "I've never seen a real duck at this Decanter, but I'm pretty sure that if they knew what a great little treat this local business is, they'd be lining up and quaking to be let in.   Duck and Decanter is an adorable little local deli, wine bar and gift shop in Phoenix. With a perfect patio to enjoy lunch on a nice day and a gift shop with unique finds to browse through while you wait for your sandwich, it's an enjoyable experience all around.   The food here is freshly made and up to gourmet par. They have a selection of cheeses to satisfy any dairy like and the wine is equivalently nice. I like to visit the Duck when I want a quality lunch and need it in a short period of time. My go-to sandwich is the ham and brie with honey mustard. It's a big sandwich too so I always have a left-over afternoon snack. They have a huge selection of drinks and chips -- including baked lays and for the times when my sweet tooth takes over, they have a variety of brownies, cookies and candy as well.   I always enjoy browsing through the gift shop and it's a perfect stop if looking for a unique gift that's off the beaten path. Duck also supports local AZ so they have several events throughout the year with local businesses and promote other local happenings around town.   The wine bar is intimate and full of spectacular vinos. I always forget about the wine bar and need to remember to visit more often.   All in all, Duck and Decanter is a True treat for my taste buds every time I visit. If you're in a hurry, call ahead and place an order to pick up because it can get pretty busy during lunch time. They also deliver!",

The atmosphere has some type of a small-town feel to it, where the place not only has sandwiches, but sells spices and wine, among other stuff. I really felt comfortable and actually wanted to spend a little more time in there, but I was on a tight schedule.  I had a turkey sandwich.  The turkey was fantastic, and the ingredients were fresh.  I was really impressed with the wheat bread.  It really made the sandwich.  As I was waiting for my sandwich, I couldn't help but notice, the many different salads they had on display.  All of them looked good, so I decided to go with a little macaroni salad.  WOW, it was so good!  I bought a half-pint, thinking I'd save some for later, when instead, I just ate  the whole thing.  Whoops!  I cant wait to go back!",

The seating area outside was lovely, and with the misters, even a mid day lunch in June was comfortable. We also shared the potato bacon soup, which was delicious and satisfying. We liked the shop inside and had fun looking at everything and smelling the different teas and coffees sold there. I also really liked how they were pet friendly with biscuits and water bowls outside. We cannot wait to go back!",

It is overpriced, and they are just sandwiches.  You are also in the Camelback corridor and right on the brink of the biltmore area, so one should not be surprised about the prices.  That having been said, I typically do not go here specifically for the food.  As to why I am a fan, the wine selection and folks who work the wine room are fantastic.  In the spring and fall months this is a great place to go with a group and just enjoy some drinks on their patio.",

    "text": "Our weekly Empowerment meeting creates around lunch. It seems we are forever looking for a place that has good prices and a quiet place for us to brainstorm and raise our energy. We have stumbled upon Duck and Decanter.  Finding this restaurant is only half the battle, the other is where the heck the front door is. I felt I was intruding on the outside patrons, only to realize I had to meander through, taking a glimpse at what they were devouring to get to the front door, an added bonus I suppose.   Opening the front door to a happily buzzing place seemed like quite a treat. To your right is small wine area, to the left were barrels and stuff. A bit confusing, but basically it is like walking into a deli shop of olden days. I had no idea what I was doing. I stood in line and squinted at the barely visible menu of an array of deli meats, smoked meats, salads and more. Of course being gluten intolerant one can hope she has hit the conscious jackpot..but not today...I will just have the insides..no bun! But wait! I see smoked duck and wait..I can order the sandwich of my choice and have it made into a salad. Well that is a great compromise!   Of course to know me is to know I am gunna ask a lot of questions, my main concern, does the smoked duck use nitrites, nitrates or any of those other nasty carcinogens. Rather shocked by the question, the gentleman serving me has no idea and had no intentions of looking. Damn! I was really hoping for the duck!   I quickly go with plan B as I weigh nitrites or high fructose corn syrup and soybean oil..with that it was the tuna salad.   You can not pay for your meal in advance as the idea is to meander the store..so I did. there were barrels of tea and coffee ready to be ground at your request. I was not impressed with the coffee grinder on the floor-ewwww. There was also an espresso area but it was not operational.   There are gadgets to buy for your kitchen, and packaged condiments and foods that I presume they make fresh there. There are fountain drinks , bottled drinks, good assortment of water and non alcoholic beer, and loads of sugary add ons within tempting reach right at the cash register-brilliant! And there is not tempting this fort Knox (well the rice cripsy treats looked..nooo must...resist...  I get my food, pay and go up stairs. There are different levels and two places to sit outside, which makes this place even more interesting.   I open my package and there right on top are two pieces of bread stuck to my tuna. I read the entry for the Entree salad and it said nothing about adding in the bread. I ordered the salad due to the fact I can not tolerate gluten.   Too hungry to care, I peel off the bread and I dive into my food and I am shocked at how awful it is. What is that mushy stuff? I think it was water chestnuts in my tuna salad. Who puts water chestnuts, (if that was what it was) in their tuna salad?   I was unimpressed with the fact that the tuna salad was put on a bed of spring lettuce (which is a thumbs up for this nutritionist), some sliced celery and string cheese. Cheese?!? Who eats cheese with their tuna?   The tuna itself was extremely dry and too salty for my liking, and I had a tough time getting it down, and eventually I got so turned off I did not finish it. There was no dressing and no taste.  I ended up not eating the salad either. What a waste of  $10.00 including guilt tip! At least the company I was with was fantastic!   Some restaurants ask you if you have been to their establishment before so that they can have the opportunity to give you the best experience possible. I truly believe this is something Duck and Decanter could adopt. Maybe I was supposed to order dressing, I have no idea. Since I had never been there before and did not know what I was doing.   I did ask someone else about the ingredients and she took the time to look and confirmed my suspicions-sigh.   I can't wait until there is a conscious shift to what we are putting in our bodies and those who are Celiac or gluten intolerant can eat without anxiety!   Is this a place for those who are Celiac or gluten intolerant?  NO there is not enough awareness of ingredients, and handling of food.   Bathrooms? yes weird..outside of the building, but clean.   Would I return?  No but for the sake of my friends, which is way more important, I will and eat some where else first.",

We then asked the worker if there was a restroom nearby that we could use. He kindly volunteered the restroom in the back. Unfortunately, it was quite dirty. And, when one of the workers walked by they got upset with us for using the restroom that the other worker gave us permission to use.  After that, the food did not seem quite so appetizing. However, we payed for and picked up our order, but even though we ordered the sandwiches hot they were not. Additionally, do beware that their cheeses are incredibly sharp.

It neighbors a furniture store and a couple of other places who very  explicitly do NOT want you parking in their store spots if you are visiting Duck & Decanter.  It's huge on the inside.  There is a little cheese section, a wine section, espresso bar with a large selection of loose teas, foodstuffs area, indoor & outdoor seating, an upstairs seating gallery, the deli...like whoah.  It's kind of like an old mercantile of days yore.  You order your sandwich and then have time to peruse the store.  They have lots of Haribo gummi snacks, including my favorite twin cherries.  There are many options for sandwiches.  I got a spicy pulled pork bbq sandwich with cole slaw inside, served in a onion-y kaiser roll.  At least I think it was supposed to be spicy.  It was good, the BBQ sauce was a little sweet for me.  The cole slaw didn't really have a \"bite\" to it, but did keep the bbq and sammie moist and stuff.  I got some seriously overpriced for the size macaroni salad, and it was some of the most mayonaissey mac salad I've had outside of Hawaiian mac salad.  You can take as many pickle spears as your heart desires.  They have a dessert case that looks delicious.  Can't really say that their customer service was stellar.  I initially walked around the store trying to figure out if I wanted to stay for a drink or whatever.  There were a lot of people working. Somebody followed me from section to section, but never bothered to ask if I needed help.  Just tailed me like a store security guard.  Maybe I looked particularly suspicious on this day...without even wearing my escaped convict prison jump suit.  Then when I opted to just get a sandwich, the staff just totally disappeared except for the sandwich maker, who had to finish up what she was doing to help me.  Kind of a weird vibe.   So, would I go back?  Sure, one visit does not make a complete story.  Heat does crazy things to people and it was a CRAZY hot day.  Overall, the sandwich was good and prices were okay.  The shop is cool.  And I bet it's cool to actually hang out there.",

You cant go wrong with their huge selection of gourmet deli meats and cheeses.  Their basic \"nooner\" sandwich has been around forever and we always get great service.    Of course, the wine bar/pub area is kind of a locals secret getaway with a huge wine cellar and some tasty beers on tap--especially during fall patio time.  If you're ready for a sandwich that is a cut above your standard deli chain, I would recommend trying the Duck.",

    "text": "I dig the Duck.  I don't even really know what to call it.  Part store, part bar, part deli, part someone's living room who doesn't make you feel guilty about not helping with the dishes, only catch being you actually have to pay for your wine and cheese (which I'm totally fine with if it means I don't feel guilty for not helping with the dishes).  Basically the duck has everything you could possibly need dispersed at different locations around what appears to be a large cabin with a lush green park in front.  You get your items (wine, coffee, sandwiches, whatever) and you mosey around, find a place to sit and enjoy them, just like you would in your own backyard, except your own backyard probably doesn't have as extensive of a wine collection or an award winning cheese department (and if it does, I officially hate you).  I like to come here for happy hour (M-F, til 7:00, $2 off house wine and draft beer) or on Sunday afternoons to do a little daydrinking and people watching.  I don't have kids or a dog, but people that do seem to love this place.  Normally I don't prefer my wine with children (probably why I don't have kids), but the Duck's overall mellow environment somehow soothes me to the point that I find myself actually enjoying the presence of the mini-humans. And if I enjoy anywhere enough to actually consider motherhood, it's probably worth at least a dozen or so stars, but Yelp only goes up to five so five it is.",

    "text": "Recently went to a happy hour with some former co-workers at D&D.  I was the first to arrive and waited at the tables outside for my party to arrive.  After a couple were there, we went inside to get some beverages and went upstairs for a table.  The beverage selection was good, I was drinking beer, and while they didn't have anything on tap that I was interested in that night, there were several in their selection of bottles.  Some more of our group arrived, and a cheese tray was ordered, and it was decided that we were going to go sit outside, b/c they were starting up the heaters.  We got a table right under a heater, not too far from three dudes playing music.  I probably would have rather stayed inside, if only because of the music...I'm not against music per se, but I have trouble listening/focusing on conversation when music is being played.  Anywho, the funny part about this was that at one point, the band brought up some girl from the crowd who sang two songs with them.  For whatever reason, the conversation stopped on the patio.  Not sure if everybody knew her or what, but another guy and I just started talking...I mean, if we were talking during the band, why not talk during this girl's singing?  Hopefully we weren't too loud and didn't offend her.  Anywho, the cheese tray was good, but wish it had been labeled, because whoever brought out the tray did not do a good job at telling us what was what (I can't even remember if one of our group brought it out or an employee).  One other minor problem was that our heater went out (ran out of gas) but no one ever came over to restart it, and it got cold...    Overall four stars.  Pretty good happy hour specials and a nice setting.  Bet this would be a pretty great place to go in the evenings when it's a tad warmer.",

    "text": "It must be me or I just never order the right thing, not sure. Everyone I know that has ever mentioned the Duck tells me they like it. Yes I have been several times over the years. But a few days ago I was at our office which is on 7th ave just south of Thomas. I was really hungry and wanted something to eat, this in it self is kind of unusual as I can more than likely wait until the end of the day before I have to eat. Plus the fact I have enough fat on me to last a few months I would not be starving to death any time soon if I missed a meal or three. So I asked Bruce, you remember Bruce he is the guy I am always asking things when down at the office. I wanted something delivered as I wanted to stay in the office to get a contract ready for signing. The only place he could think of was the Duck, but he said he could go and get it much faster. So I said ok and gave him my card and told him to get what he wants and order me I think it is called the Ducky or something like that.  Man he was back much more quickly than I had expected him to be, so they must have been on the ball in making the food. But the food as I always find; just nondescript. NO discernable flavour just a mish mash of textures and blandness. So I can say I like the building, the quickness they have gotten my food out and the patio. I guess the folks are also nice, but do not remember them so they were not not nice. I just do not get the praise this place gets, I find much better food for less elsewhere. But hey it might just be me since I am of the minority on this subject.",

    "text": "It has been many years since I had lunch at the Duck and Decanter on Camelback.  I hardly have any memories of previous experiences there, except that my impression was that it was overpriced.  Today, I was able to confirm that opinion.  Although a rather cool Biltmore area kind of vibe, it was awkward and a bit uncomfortable inside.  There is no flow.  The dry goods were exceptionally overpriced ($5.39 for a box of Carr's crackers?!).  I decided to order a little lunch and explore.  There is no love lost between customers and employees here.  I ordered a sandwich and the order taker assumed I was done.  I then asked for a side and he offered if I would like a drink.  He provided me with a large styrofoam cup.  If I hadn't already explored the interior before ordering, I would have had to ask at that point where to fill my cup.  But, I had seen the dispensers in the back corner.  I went to see what I'd like to drink.  I decided on a variety of fresh tea.  It was empty.  The woman behind this counter was quite snarky with me.  She withdrew the empty dispenser, exposing another identical dispenser behind it.  Then she got snarky.  I pulled the full dispenser toward me so I could use it.  Apparently, she was unable to provide the effort to move it herself.  After a very few minutes my name was called and I collected my order.  I was delighted to be offered a complimentary pickle spear (I love pickles) or a taffy.  There was no trouble finding an empty table outside.  I opened the bag and spread my meal.  The sandwich I had ordered on light rye was served on french roll.  The meat was meager in portion.  The swiss cheese was apparently not a slice, but rather a few sprinkles of shredded white matter.  This was not an eight dollar sandwich.  Since the menu had suggested the french roll, I decided to just eat it.  It was tasty, but not great.  I don't know what was the sweet ingredient included, but it was a little weird.  The southwest pasta salad side was ok, but a little too wet.  Overall, the $12.49 total bill was about five dollars more than the meal was worth.  I probably won't go back anytime soon.  We have too many great options today, in central Phoenix.",

With copious amounts of places to sit (inside and out) it's perfect for a leisurely bite. My adventure was during a Friday happy hour. (M-F, 5-7pm. $3 drafts! $3 house wine!) Arriving early to secure an outdoor patio spot we meandered thru the space. There's live music on Fridays with a start time of ~ 6pm.   THE BASICS Cooking accessories, teas, coffees, spices, a wide array of imported specialty foods line the shelves. Need some meat? They've got it. Want a sweet? Yep. In the mood for a sandwich? Si. Want some cheese? Be adventurous! They have adorable tiny wedges for a buck and change. \"Try something new without fear of commitment.\" Ha!  The wine / bar area, though petite in size, is lined floor to ceiling with wine bottles. Bob, the bartender on Fridays, is the friendliest gentlemen you could ever meet. The beer fridge is filled with a respectable number of bottles.   SEATING There's plenty of it. Two floors. My visit we were focused on nabbing seating outside near the live music. Turns out the music is fairly loud and you don't need to sit that close! You order your food inside and service your own tables here.  For noshing we nibbled on a patio cheese tray. I'm not entirely sure what cheese was served. Our platter included a small palmful of soft cheese, a jam spread, sliced bread and sliced apple. For the price point I'd actually have preferred a sandwich. But still tasty!  WINE TASTINGS At Duck & Decanter you can arrange a private wine & beer tasting for groups of 14-24 ppl. Lasting two hours in duration the sessions include the booze (duh!), cheese, printed info and a host. Sometimes they can include additional food. It depends on headcount and budget. ($20-$35 /person + gratuity + tax). This seems like a really neat thing to set up.  Tasting menu examples...The Beer Tasting has you traveling thru six different countries. The Business Mixer offers three red and three white wines. The Blind Tasting sounds awesome! Wine is served from a brown bag and it's up to guests to pick the grape.   So anyway, Duck & Decanter is a pretty neat experience! On the Friday I went, the outdoor space was very family friendly and multi-generational. If you're in the neighborhood check it out!",

    "text": "I remember my Dad taking me to Duck and Decanter all the way back to grade school.  In fact my Dad has known Randy and his family all the way back to when Randy and my Dad were friends at NAU.  Their 16th Street location is as recognizable to me today as it was back then.  Today I get my fix sometimes at their original location, but also sometimes make the journey to their Downtown Phoenix location on 1st Street and Jefferson.  But for a True D&D experience, the original location is where its at (even if it might be a little hard to find).  Duck & Decanter is a sandwich place first and foremost, but beyond that its a tough place to define.  In a way I sort of liken it to La Grande Orange Grocery in that its a restaurant that also has a number of grocery items you can grab on the go.  There's deli meats, cheeses, wines, coffees, and even a respectable selection of local craft brews.  There's a number of other miscellaneous items available for sale too (not all of them food or drink).  Theres seating in both the lower and upper levels of the place as well as a nice patio outside that will often have live music.  The staff has always been friendly and the mood is always casual and relaxed.  They serve breakfast and lunch items, but a True experience here is all about the Nooner sandwiches.  You can customize your own or get one of their signatures.  The Duckling is one you have to try once.  Duck, turkey, cranberry walnut relish, cream cheese and greens on walnut bread.  To me its almost like Turducken in a sandwich.  For custom sandwiches, I recommend the smoked turkey or roast beef.  There's a plethora of breads to choose from (I'm a sourdough guy) as well as a bunch of toppings to choose from.  Be sure to study the menu before ordering as the sandwich combinations are endless.  They also have some hot sandwiches to choose from if you wanna go that route.  Oh, and they always throw in the pickle and taffy are free.  So if you're around 16th Street and Camelback and looking for a freshly made sandwich or just a casual hangout spot, drive into the Sports Authority shopping complex until you reach the southeast corner of the complex and you see Duck & Decanter's original location.  Beware this place does get busy during the work week, but you can order ahead for pickup.  Its great to see this valley gem thrive and still stay True to its roots as long as it has.  Hopefully Randy's family will continue the business long enough for me to take my own kids here one day.",

They were very accommodating in letting us try several samples to insure my children would be happy with their choices.  They support local food and companies. This includes Smile Biscotti, a company created by a man with autism.

    "text": "During my recent trip to Phoenix, without a doubt my favorite find was Duck and Decanter. I discovered them while searching for a breakfast option one morning.   I actually had a hard time finding them at first. They're located by the parking garage in the SE corner of a plaza that is on the SE corner of E Camelback Rd and N 16th St. Overwhelming amount of directional abbreviations aside, if you manage to find this gem, you will not be disappointed.  I stopped here twice during my Phoenix visit. I had the breakfast burrito with egg, cheddar chz and black forest bacon for breakfast one morning. It was pretty good. Adding their salsa is really what increased the flavor and brought it up a notch.   On another day, we stopped in for lunch and had the marinated roasted chicken sandwich on sourdough bread. This was a game changer. The fresh, delicious roasted chicken was so good. It tasted like something your mom would make for you if she really loved you. Yeah, that's right mom, I'm calling you out. This is the sandwich I needed growing up. Not bologna and processed cheese. We can still salvage this relationship. Balls in your court lady.   The food here was great but they're also a specialty store. They have an assortment of greatness throughout. Barrels of coffee beans, containers of different teas, wine, cheeses, beer, different kinds of oils, all kinds of stuff.   There's seating all over, including outside, but I chose the upstairs loft both times. It was relaxing and there are giant photos of AZ wildlife all around upstairs too... I like animals... and free WiFi. Yup, they have free Wifi. I love you D&D!!!  *In a hushed voice* -- Psst, Mom, I love you too. I was just trying to be a big man in front of my friends. Your sandwiches are great.",

You order and pick up at the counter, and while you're waiting you can look around in their little shop.  They have a snack section too where you can pick something up to go with your sandwich.  I tried a bag of the popped sour cream and onion chips, which were awesome.  These are not unique to D&D though.  As for the main course, I got the D.A.M. Sandwich.  This bad boy is pork roast rubbed with southwestern spices, slow-cooked, pulled, and marinated in a jalapeno and onion barbeque sauce, topped off with their special coleslaw, and served on a onion roll.  Holy amazing.  One of the messier sandwiches I've had, but I was too busy nomming it to care.  The portion size was generous, but that doesn't mean I wasn't left wanting more!  The restaurant itself is fun, with several indoor and outdoor seating areas.  I sat in a little nook in the back wine cellar area with just a few tables.  They have a separate wine bar back there where you can choose from any of their wines, if you're into that kind of thing.  They have a good selection of non-alcoholic beverages as well.  I'm not normally into sandwich places, but I really can't wait to go back and try it again.  Once I've had the option to try other things and get a better feel for the place, I may revise this review and bump them to 5 stars.",

I told this to someone who worked there and he told me people often make that mistake, coming here dressed to the nines.  So glad to be wrong.  Went here with a friend to check out the \"Study loft\" in the pictures.  It's a pretty huge area, but I only found one plug so I'm not sure how long a study group could stay there with laptops.  Had a cheese platter with fruit, olives, crackers, and bread, but the preparer forgot my pickles.  Oh well.  Maybe next time.  We'll be back to try more cheeses, that's for sure.  So far, it's the only place I've run into that has Derby Sage.  Mmmm.  Also: Patio is dog friendly.",

I usually go for a turkey, bacon, and avocado sandwich on wheat bread. Can you say yum?! The bacon especially, since it is huge and thick - I'm pretty sure it's prosciutto, 'cause this ain't no regular bacon. I always order this sandwich and my husband always wants a bite or half the sandwich. (He usually orders the Genova sandwich.) It's definitely a sandwich you could share, but only grudgingly.   The store itself is really nice to browse and find specialty chocolates or treats while you wait for your sandwich. I'm always tempted to buy the fancy chocolate bars - there's too many to choose from! It's nice that they carry local product and other items.  There's plenty of room to sit, whether it's upstairs or outside on the patio. The patio is fantastic, especially when there's live music. We love coming here on the weekend to sit back and relax.   If you love sandwiches, you should definitely stop by Duck & Decanter. This is one of the best sandwich places in Phoenix!",

The sandwich was pretty small and all you get is a sandwich for $8.25.  Well, you can also grab a piece of chewy taffy while you pay.  They have outdoor seating which is pretty nice where you can hang out, read a book, and even bring your dog.  I saw a sign that said they welcome dogs on the patio which is pretty cool.",

On that note, there is one person in particular who has gone above and beyond for me. His name is Jason and many who have seen us interact think that we have been friends for a long time. The truth is that we met at the duck. Not only do i trust him as barista but now he is my confidant. When my day gets overwhelming from work, i go visit him and he does not hesitate me whip me up an herbal tea blend or a special coffee to always put a smile on my face.

After showing them around town on Sunday, Dec. 29th we were all hungry around 1pm. With the numerous dining options in Central Phoenix we decided to go to the Duck and Decanter on E. Camelback.  Friends in town have been raving about that place for years and now this was our opportunity to try it and show our friends a good time.  We arrived last Sunday a little after 1pm.  Outside was very busy but managed to find a an empty table for the four of us.  I decided to wait at the table to save it as it was the last one available. The others went inside to place our orders. My first impression was. Not good. There was no landscaping, vegetation or flowers. Felt like we were sitting on a concrete slab in the shopping center parking lot.  Also looked a bit trashy with several dirty tables left unattended. Ambiance a big Zero.  After about 25 mins of waiting outside at the table the rest of my party came out with brown paper bags and drink cups.  In that amount of time we could of had a fabulous sit down and served lunch at one of the many great cafes in the neighborhood. They said it was busy ordering the food and only two persons working behind the line taking orders.  On a busy Sunday afternoon this is unacceptable. I ordered a BLT on sourdough bread with a side of coleslaw.  For almost $8.00 per sandwich they could afford to be a little less chinsy with them. The sourdough bread was just cheap white bread that you can buy at the grocery for 99 cents per loaf.  There were exactly 2 slices of over cooked bacon with a piece of brown wilted lettuce on mayo.  The only ingredient they were generous with was the whole tomato that was sliced and piled on the sandwich to make it appear that it was a heartier sandwich.  I didn't order a big fat tomato and mayo sandwich. Shame on you Duck and Decenter.  My side of coleslaw was practically inedible.  Coleslaw swimming in watered down slaw sauce (more like mayonnaise and warm milk) was not at all tasty.  Another person in my party ordered an over priced spinach salad with barely any spinach.  She never told them when ordering yo hold the spinach. Really people!!!! Also she had to wait another 25 mins to get her ice tea because she was told that they had run out. Couldn't they have told her when she ordered it and let her make a different drink choice.  While eating our less than acceptable meal a man was playing the guitar and singing.  He sounded okay but his volume was way way to loud. We literally could not even coo in ate with each other being at least 50 feet away from him.  This total experience at the Duck and Decanter left a bitter taste in my mouth and not just from the awful food. We will never be back.  They can keep their lousy service, inedible over priced food and \"cluck it\".",

I initially ordered their duckling sandwich, but they had run out of the cranberry relish, so I went with the honey glazed ham sandwich. It was average or below average. Not much to it...just ham, mayonnaise, tomato, lettuce and cheese. The cheese and bread were quite good and everything else was average. The amount of ham/meat compared to the amount of every other ingredients was sub-par.  All in all, an average place to eat.",

    "text": "10 Reasons why I love thee:   1. Specifically, the Where's the Beef? Vegetarian sandwich. Fresh veggies like avocado, sprouts, lettuce, swiss and more. Good bread, not dry, not stale, just plain good bread. Plus full of flavor! And I'm not even a vegetarian.  2.   Alcohol with my sandwich, what a great thing to pair up and a huge variety at their wine bar  3. Side options, so many to choose from and not just the normal potato salad or pasta salad. They have those too, but sides like cottage cheese with herbs, southwestern salad, egg salad and more  4. Bread, meat, spreads and cheese selections too - I haven't tried all of them, but they all look delicious  5. The gift store... I'm always looking for a place to bring out of town visitors and this will be one of them. Its an airy building with cute items and some would be useful around the house too  6. All of the seating options, upstairs, downstairs, in the wine bar area, outside with live music, even midway on the stairs  7. Friendly service from the people taking our food order to the bartender taking our drinks  8. Live music in the courtyard area, such peaceful music that is not blaring loud. I can hear myself talk and enjoy the music too  9. That its next to Copenhagen Furniture. Yeah... most wouldn't care, but give me a break, I'm looking for furniture.  10. Half size options. I still take half of my meal home, but at least I'm not eating multiple meals of it.    I haven't tried the coffee or their breakfast, but I'm sure its good too. I know this place has been around for a long time and I have no idea what it tasted like before, but I like what it is now. I love this place just the way it is.",

They have a giftshop which is cute.  I have not gone there for their wine bar, but I hear its good!  I would try it!  All the ingredients are fresh and the staff there are always so upbeat and friendly!  It is always busy so just be prepared for that...you can always order ahead!    They also have a location downtown...its nice, but this one is better.  That one caters more to those that need something to go quickly!",

Plus, I love sitting on the patio drinking wine when the weather is nice with my best gal.   Anyhow, my other best gal, my mom had never tried this spot. I  thought Duck would be great for a quick casual lunch. She's a vegetarian so we ordered the Where's the Beef sandwich to share. It took about 20 minutes to make the sandwich, which feels like an eternity when your hungry.  When I glanced at the sandwich I thought perhaps they had added some portobello mushrooms to it. Turns out, the dark brown layer was actually rotten avocado. REALLY!!!!??? I mean come on! Avocado is like prime rib to vegetarians. How can you F this up? It was truly nasty. It got me to thinking, if someone actually put this into the sandwich, what else would their low standards allow them to place into an unsuspecting victims sammie. It's not like they make them with blindfolds on. I was really grossed out.  When I brought it to the manager's attention, she didn't seem that bothered by it. They remade half a sandwich for me, and that was that.  It was annoying b/c I left feeling that Duck & Decanter takes for granted the fact that loyal customers will stick with them no matter what. Well, not this one.  Plus, that place needs a serious dusting. Yuck.",

    "text": "Anyone who knows me will tell you that this is my favorite place on earth. I know that it sounds like an exaggeration. It is not. EVERYTHING is phenomenal here.   \"The Duck\" is my measuring stick for every other sandwich shop and deli.   Your first time here may be a little confusing, because your order will be taken on a paper bag and there are a lot of options. You should feel safe in the knowledge that no matter what you get you will be happy.   My favorites are:  Traditional sandwich.... Roast Beef or Smoked Turkey on any of the breads, with mayo, lettuce, tomato, swiss cheese, add sprouts.   Feeling like tuna? Alabcore tuna on toasted ciabatta, with no celery, add sprouts, with lettuce, tomato, and swiss cheese. The Albacore as a salad is a great option if you are not eating breads at the time (which would be tragic because all of their bread is fresh and perfect).  Uncommon... Italian Dry Salami on sourdough with mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, and swiss cheese. Just do it.   Get the tea of the day. Browse the wine and beer room, consider getting a coffee drink at some juncture, and peruse all of the knick knacks and food stuffs. They'll call your name when it is ready.  I have had just about everything on the menu. No, I HAVE had everything on the menu.   I am partial to the swiss cheese because I have not been able to find cheese like that anywhere else, but if you like cheddar (some of  you do) then try the Longhorn- it is the same price as the swiss, any other cheese will cost you extra. If you like cheese in general, then do yourself a favor and get a cheese tray, call some friends, get some wine, and relax. Get a sandwich to share with your pals, you don't want to make them jealous.",

It might run you a couple of dollars more than a Subway sandwich but it's worth it.  Service is great, but as others have mentioned its not really a sit-down restaurant, you go up and order your sandwich, pick it up, and you can sit either outside or upstairs if you want to 'dine-in'.",

It was awful, long wait, skimpy sandwich, loud music on patio, so loud and somewhat abrasive when the singer talked to the audience. I couldn't hear or talk to the person sitting right next to me.   This was the 29th and a Sunday brunch.  Disappointed, will not go back, especially since there are so many new and fantastic eateries in Phoenix!  You can't rely on a name, Duck and Decanter, your poor service, etc will catch up and you will not survive.  My advice to all who ask,  where is a good place to eat, I will say not Duck and Decanter!",

I'm a fan of the \"Where's the Beef?,\" a vegetarian sandwich, aptly named because when you bite into it, you don't give a damn where the beef is because your mouth is full of avocado, tomato, pine nuts, and other tasty things.  Their ladies' room has one of those weird towel machines in it.  You know, where you roll out a clean section of towel to wipe your hands?  Not paper towels, real towel.  I've never seen one anywhere else.  The area near the kitchen is filled with all sorts of weird luxury kitchen stuff; spices and dishes and expensive decorations, and other crappy junk that no one needs.  I can't decide whether it annoys me or keeps me entertained while I'm waiting for my sandwich.  At any rate, you'll get a tasty sandwich and the upstairs area is a nice quiet place to talk with your friends during a meal.  If you're looking for a bargain, Cheese & Stuff on Central and Camelback is a better value for a great sandwich.  But The Duck has a heck of a lot more options.",

If you're looking for quality ingredients and sandwiches made with love, this is the place for you. As soon as I walked in, I was overwhelmed by the amount of fresh ingredients and specialty sandwiches. Their vibe is old school, like think a nice cozy pub during the Middle Ages with brighter lighting, and it's definitely different from other restaurants in Phoenix. I ordered their best seller, the Vermont Treat, famous for their cheddar cheese spread. As soon as I bit into it, I was in heaven! That spread is so delectable, I wish I could put it on every single sandwich I make. I've spent a few summers in Vermont, and its namesake lives up to the reminiscent fresh flavors that Vermont evokes.  Some other pluses of D&D is their grocery selection, which has everything from jams and old fashioned sodas, to funny nut bags called \"Nut Sacks\". There's more than enough ample seating indoors and outdoors, and their happy hour specialties include $3 drafts and select sandwiches, too! The staff was friendly and chill, and I had a nice afternoon reading outdoors and eating my sandwich. I'll definitely be back to try more on their menu, especially the Nooner, which I heard was delicious!",

Brisket cooked in cinnamon, ginger, and spices was interesting with an Asian flair but had little else in the sandwich. It arrived with the bottom half of the bread soggy from juice and covered in a pile of melted cheese that didn't really complement the meat. Wish some veggies could have been paired with it to balance out the heavy cheese and meat.   Potato salad was great but couldn't save the disappoint from a small $10 sandwich.  For a higher priced sandwich it was quite 1 dimensional and disappointing. Overall, a very meh Uber Eats experience that left much to be desired and for the price not worth it.",

But I can attest to how delish their coconut macaroons are, they are soft, moist and sweet, perfectly cooked on the outside and soft and tender on the inside. Also they carry Fairytale Brownies, and I know those are bomb!   My 2 favorite sandwiches right now are the Vermont Treat & Sonoran Chicken.  The Sonoran Chicken has a spicy oil & vinegar sauce like and has jicama, bell peppers, cilantro, corn and green onions with chicken all mixed together and I always pick to have it on ciabatta bread with Swiss cheese, tomatoes and some lettuce, omg this is such a great sandwich! So good I crave it at times! The Vermont is a maple glazed ham sandwich with pine nuts, spinach, sliced apples and cheddar cheese, omg this is heaven on bread!  The blend of the ham cheese and apples are amazing, beautiful flavors happening their!  This location is pretty sweet too, there is seating upstairs as well as downstairs, and on the weekends there is live music out in the patio area. And there is a even a beer & wine garden and a cozy fireplace too!  Yep this Duck & Decanter is becoming a favorite of mine. I'm sure I'll be back in no time.",

Still cute and lovely, but the roast beef sandwich had scarce roast beef and for $13.00, a sandwich, bag of chips and a fountain drink left me feeling a little taken advantage of.  It would still be a great sandwich if there was any roast beef on it...but without the little side of potato salad and a pickle I think it used to come with, and without any roast beef, it's way short of expectations and previous reputation.",

We went for lunch and they were setting up for a live band (we didn't stay long enough to see them play but they sounded good when they were testing).   I ordered the Duckling since it was one of their signature sandwiches and it sounded good. I was looking forward to the smoked duck, but I was disappointed. The cranberry sauce completely overpowered the meat so that's all I could taste. I don't mind cranberries, but it felt more like I was eating a jelly sandwich because it was too sweet. I could only finish half my sandwich and tossed the rest. I loved the outdoor patio and the fact that they're dog friendly, but the food didn't cut it for me.",

I'm always exploring the on going new trends of resturaunts in central phoenix but I didn't expect to be blown away buy this place. I was craving something more scrumptious and light for lunch and nothing to fancy. I noticed this interesting name tucked behind a shopping complex and the first impressions were a little creepy.  Tons of patio space and two separate entrances and only two people outside. I walked in and was greeted right away. When you walk in you will notice a coffee bar and a little quick grocery pick up for some of the finest cheeses, and home made goods.  I ordered the chicken salad sandwich that comes and it was super delicious and huge. I crave that sandwich often now. Craving a home made sandwich for lunch, then this is the place you want to give your attention too!",

We decided to check this place out for lunch wanting something light and this is one of the best spots we've been to for sandwiches! You get to pick what kind of bread you want along with meat.

But she's so cute.  Ok to the food. Its been about about two years since I have been to the The Duck and I have to say I really need to come back sooner next time. My usual fare is a roast beef or corned beef sandwich, but this time I wen for the duck sandwich. I can't believe that I waited this long to try out the signature meal.   You get to choose what you want, a variety of cheese is accompanied by different mustards, mayo and of course the tomatoes, lettuce, onions, and of course almost every type of bread. What is probably the most fascinating is the assembly process. There are always at least five people assembling the orders, three taking orders or getting the orders to the customer.   You order at one end, wait around a but and pick up on the other end. On between there are cookies, sauces, coffee pots and almost anything one could want to have a yummy meal. Then there is the stuff for the home kitchen or counter.   So to the review the duck sandwich was amazing, going to have it again. Got mine on a croissant with a bit of mayo and mustard. Only got a half, with a beer. There is a small pub style corner with a smaller choice of beers. This didn't damper the meal at all.   The place is always hopigng seems like. Seating upstairs overlooks the lower area, and the outside always seems to have a couple of four legged companions that are sometimes as humorous as the owners. The little fellas seem to know exactly how much they can annoy their larger counterparts.   This is one nice deli, sandwich shop and gathering of just plain great folks. Oh yeah and Beverly Kidd was great fun to be with and eat with.. she also seemed to like the Chocolate Surprise cake I got for her.... opppss was that suppose to be kept quite?",

If your idea of a good sandwich involves shaved truffles and roquefort cheese, this is not your restaurant. The sandwiches are generally straightforward, using common ingredients.  However, the reason I keep returning over and over is because I very much like standard deli sandwiches, and I've never had better ones than at D&D. (A simple ham-turkey-salami-cheddar on ciabatta is my usual.) The bread is fresh and soft, the meat is flavorful and shaved very thin, and the portion sizes are just right for me.",

Forgot the they hate that cheese.  So out it comes.  I don't like Swiss either, so I can't even eat what they put aside.  My husband had the Briescutto.  Now that just melts in your mouth good!  Great place to add calories after you try burning it!",

Adorable space with knick knacks, culinary odds and ends, loose leaf teas, and mmmm cheese. They also have a wine shop for those gearing up for a romantic picnic at Papago Park. Quality ingredients, helpful staff, and decent prices. Why would anyone ever go to Subway or Quizno's when you could go to Duck and Decanter instead?? They also have dessert...mmmmm mmmm definitely one of the places I miss about living in Phoenix.",

I guess I'll go inside next time I'm here; it's about to get so hot! Edit: they tell me they have misters too, and not just the masculine variety. ;)",

I got one of their specialty sandwiches called the Genoa.  It had Genoa salami, spinach and marinated tomatoes with herbed cream cheese on french bread.  This was amazing!

In the wine room, you will find an excellent selection wines and beers, and an always helpful and knowledgeable staff member should you, like myself, need help making a choice. The patio is a wonderful place to spend an afternoon, especially when there is live music and fabulous weather. (Plus dogs are welcome on the patio.)

On the weekdays the place is bustling with corporate America, moms meeting up and exchanging baby stories, a few networkers collaborating on a project and one or two snooty folks. It make up a wonderful array of folks having lunch.   On the weekends there are families, dogs, children, babies, old folks, young folks sharing stories and sitting outside listening to the great performer chosen for that weekend. There are misters around the patio area.  I love the nooks and crannies where you can sit inside or outside. The sandwiches are good. I love the turkey on dark rye with avocado. They are generous on all fronts. Yes the place is pricey! Drinks, sandwiches and chips can run almost $30 for two people! However you get a free small concert on the weekends. The kids run loose, the dogs bark and it is fun! The wait staff is incredibly friendly and several folks have been working there for years.   This is not a place for those individuals looking for a fancy dancy sandwich. This is a place to have fun, relax and enjoy some good food and a great atmosphere!",

The bar is usually staffed by older employees while the sandwich counter has younger but still very nice employees crafting tasty eats.  The jalapeno havarti cheese is absolutely wonderful on a sonoran chicken salad sandwich. I believe the best reviews of this restaurant probably have taken full advantage of the customizable menu options. It does boost the price of the average sandwich up though. I almost always get pine nuts and pepperoncinis in addition to the standard options and the sandwich ends up being 9 dollars or so. A bit pricey but completely worth it.  As mentioned in numerous other reviews there are multiple seating options. An outdoor patio, tables next to the wines and bar area, tables at the east end of the lower floor and upstairs which are accessed via staircase at the east side of the sandwich/grocery area.  There is a great selection of deli meats and cheeses at the west end of the sandwich counter. A very respectable selection of tea, coffee and other local goods. Including hot sauces, coffee cups and various small gifts.  Great place to hang out on a Friday after work and listen to some live music while drinking a craft beer and enjoying their patio with a fire place.  A note to those parking here. The spots for customers is between the office building and the parking structure just south of the building.",

One complaint though is that they got rid of the maple glazed ham. That was the best, lean ham, and the replacement is just not satisfying. The staff is always helpful and friendly, especially with newbies that aren't familiar with the Nooner. I agree with the others that it is pricey. $7 for a sammich and $2 for a bag of Kettle chips?

This place would be perfect for me!\"  As it turns out, I wasn't quite wrong, but it was not at all what I expected.  The Duck and Decanter is a strange blend of deli, gourmet food and kitchen wares store, as well as wine shop.  It all comes together in a fun and eclectic building set far back from the street and the rest of the shops in the area.  You definitely feel, as you enter the candlelit courtyard beneath an enormous old tree, that the world outside does get a little more muffled than it really should be.  Wandering bemusedly through the tiny shop behind the courtyard, I was really struck by how unique this place felt in Phoenix.  Care is obviously put into not only the choice of wares being sold here, but the quality of food presented to the customer.  When I finally got around to the deli counter, I was about to order their specialty duck sandwich when I saw they had a reuben.  As I find it hard to turn down a reuben anywhere, I asked the woman behind the counter what she advised.  Without hesitation she said, \"The reuben.\"  Just as I had hoped and I'm glad I listened.  The sandwich was excellent.  Perfectly proportioned and fresh as possible without going backwards in time.  Making a good sandwich really is an art and the workers here are masterful as their craft.  Sitting outside at night with a wonderful sandwich in this strangely out of place shop is an opportunity not to be missed.  But take care to go there when you have some time to really savor the place.  Like the wine, there's much to enjoy here and it'd be a shame to miss any of it.",

They have a wonderful selection of deli sandwiches and will also make them to order. The beer and wine room is also a great attraction as well as the coffee bar. The meat and cheese counter is a great place to order a tray for the patio while listening to live music. I have to say that my favor go to is the Albacore tuna on multi grain and other favorite is smoked turkey on pita add avocado with all the other fixings. Review the menu prior to coming so you are prepared to order. We often phone in and pick up then head to a park or event.   Great sun teas and desserts to choose from as well!!!!!",

You could wonder around for quite awhile and find something you would want to buy that you could not find anywhere else. Their sandwich selection is vast. I paid nearly $12 for The Duckling Smoked breast of duck, smoked turkey, cream cheese, cranberry walnut relish & spicy spring mix on walnut raisin country bread.      The meat was sparse.  (2 thin slices).    The sandwich was large. The bread was fresh and had that home made flavor you look for. The flavor of the sandwich was fabulous.   They had about 5 ice tea selections. All very good. The place is pretty cool and their are many options.",

This place is a fabulous, family owned one stop shop for good food and local goodies! The store is filled with everything local from wine, coffee, tea, spices, jellies, salsas and my favorite fun find of the day nut sacks...yes you read that correctly(see my pic) They come in a variety of sizes and flavors and who doesn't love a sense of humor... I am getting them for gifts, sure beats lumps of coal! We shared a platter of cheese, fruit and meat served up with some honey mustard and bites of bruschetta bread, it was a great balance and flavor filled lunch. We chose some of our own items and had them throw in a few of their favorites. I loved the spice and flavor of the habanero cheese, the blueberry goat cheese with the prosciutto was a perfect combination and the Pichuberries from Columbia were a sweet surprise. The blueberry tea was so good and I don't even like tea! They had live music outside on a spacious patio and game tables upstairs. I can't wait to come back for a Nooner....I hear they're amazing with so many combinations of sandwiches to try you could have one every day of the week! I mean who doesn't want a Hot One or a Banger for lunch!  This is the perfect place to stop, shop and eat local, I can't wait to come back for more!",

D&D is hard to describe because although their bread and butter are the deli items, they offer so much more. As you can see they have a full gift shop filled with artisinal cheeses, kitchen knick knacks, and more. Some from local vendors, which is a big plus. They also offer a full coffee bar, with one of the biggest take home tea selections I've seen, and a beer and wine bar with lots of bottles to peruse.   They are ideal if you want to grab a quick lunch, study in the quiet upstairs deck, host a meeting (I see this a lot), or just grab a glass of wine and watch some live music outside. Basically you can spend your whole day there.  Now on to the food. The salads are always great. The macaroni salad and the egg salad are a few of my faves. Today I had the Vermont Treat with Broccoli Cheddar Soup. The soup was dense and packed with Broccoli florets, but the sandwich left something to be desired. It was a little dry, I think it had too much spinach and not enough spread. I'm still giving this place four stars, despite the sandwich I had today as their food is consistently impressive.",

    "text": "As another reviewer wrote this place definitely feels LGO in ways. But not exactly, it feels like a not-as-hip twin LGO grocery/wine store in Omaha, circa 1983.  Not that that's bad or anything.  There's always some nostalgic value for places that concentrate on food and comfortable homey environ so that they aren't so hip it hurts.  My first visit to Duck and Decanter was on a recent Thursday for lunch and was filled with the normal Camelback Corridor office drones and car salesmen. Delicious mix of people I tell you, but even more delicious was the maple glazed ham and muenster sandwich on whole wheat topped with avocado.  My lunch buddy opted for the tuna and it was pretty tasty but not the best I have ever had.  The pricing was average and with chips and a soda came out to about $10. Bonus points for the cheese selection feature bite-sized samples for a dollar or so.   The wine store was small and charming and the layout of the place is so unconventional (with most seating upstairs) that it makes for some fascinating exploring once you get over the overwhelming collection of tacky bric a brac everywhere.   I'm disappointed that it's kind of hidden, but that's probably best since I would be here all the time for a sammie and some wine come happy hour. Is it 4 pm yet?",

Made to order sandwiches on fresh breads with a crunchy pickle slice and small candy; nice wine selection with helpful wine staff. The Duck has sold gourmet coffee and teas, along with espresso, before it became hip. Great selection of local and gourmet mustards, salsas , sauces, and spice mixes, along with some nice cookware at reasonable prices.  The location is a bit hidden and the patios somewhat awkward. Parking is disappointing. But this is compared to the pre-freeway, Starbucks, etc. Duck & D that had a grassy lawn and large shade trees.",

    "text": "I just don't get it.  Why would you pay such a high price for such a mundane and uninspired sandwich?  I had the garlic chicken (which wasn't very garlicky and just seemed like glorified chicken salad) sandwich and really wasn't impressed.  I also opted for a ridiculously priced Greek salad- coming out to over five bucks for eight ounces.  It just wasn't amazing in any stretch of imagination, and nowhere near the money it cost.  The actual building is of some interest.  I enjoy that you can eat upstairs and they'll clip your sandwich to a sack and send it up to you.  The front patio was inviting.  However, the layout doesn't really lend itself to an efficient order.  The nonalcoholic drinks are set in the back, while the alcohol is set in another room entirely.  The bathrooms are pretty much like a public park restroom- and just as dirty.    I understand that it is locally owned and has somehow been voted best sandwich for something like thirty years, but eh, unless you're craving an overpriced, and ordinary sandwich... I'd skip it.",

Now that I am an adult (almost), I love coming here and just enjoying a leisurely meal on the patio. Of course, it is better when the weather is cooler. I can enjoy a nice lunch with my mom here after we have been out on one of our shopping excursions.   I also came here a few months ago with a childhood friend who was in town with her 16 month old daughter. The patio was great because we could eat and talk, and her daughter was amused by everything going on there. She could walk around a little, and try to eat leaves off the ground, which kept her happy and amused while we caught up. Of course we didn't let her actually eat the leaves. ;)  I have never had a bad sandwich here, and they have a wine bar. What else could you ask for? Well, I do wish it was closer to home so I could go more often, but other than that, I love it!",

    "text": "Duck and Decanter is one of those places where while eating your meal, you suddenly think, \"Wait. Am I still in Phoenix?\"   This place is SO unlike anything else in midtown Phoenix that going there for the atmosphere is half the pleasure. It's part sandwich shop, part eclectic boutique, part wine cellar, part loft. And some other things thrown in too.   Tucked away in a corner of a generic strip mall the place looks like someone's house from the 70's. Hard to describe. Once you enter there is a counter where you place your order with a little salad case, a cheese case, and a dessert case. Once you get your sandwich (or salad), you can either sit outside on the patio or take the stairs up to the upper dining area. Or sit on the upper deck outside patio.   And yeah, the sandwiches can get a bit pricey but like I said, half the fun of the place is the atmosphere. I've always enjoyed my sandwich. It's not like I'm paying for something I don't like. The breads and the 'fixin's' have always been fresh and full of flavor.   Go get a sandwich, do a little browsing, relax, and take in some people watching.   And if you can figure out what city the place reminds you of, please let me know. Cause it's not Phoenix, for sure.",

I had just flown in from Seattle to meet him (we met online) and we were staying at Squaw Peak so this was a quick jaunt away from the resort. As mezmerized as I was by the uniqueness of AZ and the ecleticness of the area, \"The Duck\" was like something I had never experienced before. (So you can imagine my surprise when this Seattlelite saw MISTERS for the first time!)   The food is fabulous...gourmet sandwiches, salads, chips...I'm hungry just thinking about it! I feel the Duck lends itself to the quick lunch, the relaxing lunch spent listening to the live music or to GIRL TIME with delicious cheese/salads and WINE! And their little gift shop has SO many wonderful things in it...most especially the TEA! I feel safe in saying that \"The Duck\" very possibly has the BEST iced tea I've ever enjoyed. (Well, it is RIGHT up there with PF Chang's and The GreenHouse at the very least!)  Please do youself and flavor...visit D & D and see for yourself what all the buzz is about...you won't be sorry!",

There is something wonderfully lazy about spending an hour or so at D&D...the beer and wine bar may add to this...as well as the decent patio seating.

    "text": "One of the best Sunday afternoons I've had in a while....  My first judgement was wrong about this place. Being tucked away in newer buildings behind a starbucks, with kind of a goofy name for a lunch market, I was pretty sure this place was going to be a big disappointment.  WRONG (yay)  Though a confusing layout/way of doing things, the small but impressive market of cheeses, meats, pastas, beverages, teas, coffees, sauces and little do-dads is cute cozy and inviting.  The wine room is small but good and fairly well stocked with a good variety of wines, though a measly wine by the glass selection for a fairly impressive cellar.    Workers were a little awkward at times but really helpful in making selections.  We opted for a sandwich and a cheese platter for two, accompanied by a bottle of Reisling.  The sandwich was really good and fresh, the sun dried tomatoes were awesome - though as a sandwich in whole i've had better.  The make your own cheese platter was AWESOME-you get to choose as many cheeses as you'd like, getting the chance to look through them and read descriptions and touch, great for someone like me who loves a good cheese but knows nilch about names and pairings.  It was fresh, BIG, and simple-A in my book.   The owners son was friendly and knowledgeable, helping us select the right bottle of wine to go with our cheeses, a not easy task being I like sweeter whites while he likes dry crisp ones.  Though not the best wine i've had, we got a very good bottle for 15 bucks that was enjoyable.   As far as seating goes they have multiple areas inside and out, we very much enjoyed the front outdoor patio with sun covers, live music, grass, and the dog and children friendly atmosphere.   Only downsides I'd have to say would be the confusing layout with lack of direction, and the sometimes \"airy\" staff behind the counters.  But all in all though we had a great time and will definitely be going again soon.",

I am not giving 5 stars b/c I sometimes feel ripped off but I continue to go to Duck & Decanter.    2 words: PATIO PLATTER  The Patio Platter is like heaven in front of your face, you get to pick a meat and cheese assortment with crackers and bread.  I swear if I am the only person in there, it takes 30 minutes to get the platter and if there are 50 people in there, it takes 30 minutes to get the platter--- I suppose consistency is good.  It's worth the wait (and weight) -- it so delicious!  The little shop inside is fun to pick up a few interesting gifts, it's overpriced but sometimes they have 20% off sales on everything in the shop that isn't edible....   The Duck will forever be a place I like to enjoy sitting outside with either an iced tea or a glass of wine with friends n  family and nosh on some yummy food.",

To find it just turn into the shopping center where Target is at then head towards the office building/parking garage that's near the 51.   Very welcoming place. We tried to enter through the wrong door and the bartender was incredibly friendly and quickly opened it for us.   You order at the counter and then can wait or head to the bar area and they will bring you your food. It has a deli feel, reminded me of DelFalco's with the store being part of the restaurant. They sell a ton of loose leaf tea, fun snacks and other items that are fun to browse while you wait for your food.   We ordered two sandwiches. What stood out to me most was how fresh and fluffy the bread was! It was hands down the star ingredient for me. The duckling was very good, I typically don't like cream cheese on my sandwiches but it added a nice creaminess that compliments the bread and duck. The Vermont treat was also very good, a little bit on the sweeter side. I loved the addition of the apple but my husband felt like it was just too sweet.   They do offer a few beers on tap, some select wines by the glass and a lot of bottled beer, ciders and wines that you can buy.   I will definitely be back, I really enjoyed the laid back atmosphere and the friendliness of all the people who helped us. Definitely did not feel like we were in Phoenix.",

    "text": "Wine, beer, indoor and outdoor seating, and a little shop!  This was my second time at Duck & Decanter, this place is great if you want to pick up a delicious bowl of soup & sandwich.  Duck and Decanter has more of a market feel vibe with a lunch board where they serve up some unique sandwiches you won't find at a normal deli or sandwich shop.    You order at the counter, wait for your name to be called, take a seat, and enjoy your meal. Today, we decided to dine outdoors. The outdoor dining area was perfect. Just the right combination of shade and sun, it was ideal. I can't think of a better way to spend  a lunch hour - eating, talking, relaxing.  My lunch companions had the beef brisket chili & 1/2 Ruben sandwich. Both said the Ruben was the best they ever had. I had the Smokey with ham. One of the best sandwiches I have ever had! The cheese was perfectly melted and seemed to cover ever piece of the ham.  After, you dine take a look around the store.  The market area has a good mix of items from all over the globe and the bar area has a good selection of beer and wine.   If you ever find yourself in the area or your  just looking for good soup and sandwiches stop by you won't be disappointed.",

To your right there are shelves filled with products you could purchase. We ended up grabbing some Lady Earl Grey tea since I've never tried it before (heads up, it kinda tastes like fruit loops). They have a bar here as well, but we were mainly interested in the sandwiches. I ended up getting the m-fiery and was glad that it came on a baguette as opposed to sliced bread. The sand which was pretty small so I imagine the full size would have been enough for one person. The bread was pretty tough to eat and cut up the roof of my mouth pretty bad, but I just assumed that maybe fancy bread is supposed to do that. They also have their pickles individually wrapped, but I don't live the zero waste lifestyle so it didn't bother me as much as it may bother other people. The reason for the four stars is that the sandwich tastes pretty good and the staff are so friendly! Also there are plenty of spots to sit...at the bottom level in the back of the store, upstairs, in front of the shop, or behind the shop",

It gives you the chance to grab a meal and a snack or souvenir.  The guy that took our order was super helpful about answering our questions about the menu, and gave us a tip on the hike we were heading to after lunch.  2. There is outdoor dining. Two separate outside areas. I noticed there were stairs inside, but I did not check out where they went. I'm not sure if it was more market, or more dining room.  3. The food was really good. I had my \"go to\" a ham and cheese croissant, and my hubs had the rueben and a cup of soup. You have your choice of all sorts of sides. You can get something they have pre prepared or grab a bag of chips or a cookie or whatever in the market area that strikes your fancy!  4. They sell wine and beer!   It's tucked back behind Copenhagen furniture and DXL Clothing, so that's why we missed it. I could not see it from the road, and google maps failed me a bit. So look for those two signs and you will be able to park right outside.",

This is also the term used by Duck & Decanter to describe their sandwiches (says so right on the bag).  Is this an implication that their food is as good as sex?  I have been here twice so far, and while I wouldn't equate their sandwiches with any kind of amorous activity, this is still and amazing place to order lunch.  It's one of the few places in the Phoenix Valley that's comparable to the hof braus that I used to go to as a kid in San Francisco.  This place is one where if it's lunchtime and I'm in the vicinity, eating there is a no-brainer.  I will literally look for reasons to come here.  If I see you with a bag saying \"A Nooner\" on it, it either means that you are about to have a delicious meal, or you've just had one.  Take your significant other here, and maybe you can have two Nooners together that day.",

Tucked away in the parking lot Duck and Decanter is a great spot for lunch, coffee, drinks, and even live music. At first the menu and market area is a little overwhelming with so much food around, hams, cheeses, deli, sandwiches, it was a little hard to find the menu or pin point what to order. The lady was kind and gave us samples of some of their pasta salads etc.  I ended up ordering the Reuben with a side of curry chicken salad.  I HIGHLY recommend the curry chicken salad, delish!! I am a huge fan of reuben and order them about 99% of them time if they are offered on the menu. This time however I was a little disappointed on how thin the portion was of meat and how thin the bread was. Also, they added some type of red sweet pepper which threw off the original taste. I would have liked less pepper and more meat.  The atmosphere is very crowded inside, however they offer a ton of patio seating which I would totally go back for during the evening to enjoy some of their wine.",

The staff making the sandwiches are kids with not a ton of experience, judging by the inconsistency of sammy filler (the expensive sliced duck sandwich often contains tiny slivers of the star of the show). Not line people/pros, just kids workin a PT job like at the dang Pizza Hut. Hardly artisan sammies like the prices infer. They do however have an excellent selection of sugarless iced teas and the environment is one of the best in Phoenix. Like a big ole house with cool seating upstairs and on the patio and they often have fun music acts outside.  As a venue to chill this place rules. But for the actual food, for lunch, which is primarily sandwiches, it is not good. Maybe in 1996 this could have passed for a good food place, but Boars Head is no longer a selling point. Hey cigarettes used to be good for you and 4 out 5 doctors recommended 'em. But things done change partner. Have been going here for many years and as of the last few it's gone way downhill.

    "text": "What a fantastic and unique sandwich shop/deli!   Duck and Decanter is a treat for all who enter. I hadn't been here in years, but the minute I entered I knew it was as good as ever. Once you enter you are immediately greeted with the smell of cheeses, fr ah breads, baked goods, and various coffee/treats that are for sale around the store. The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable about everything that they sell. You can choose a sandwich they have on the menu or create your own with just about any meat, cheese, bread, salad you can think of. We ordered the egg salad sandwich on an onion roll and a chicken salad sandwich with sprouts on dark rye...both were exceptional and as good as we remembered. Our order took about 7 minutes which flew by since there is so much to see and buy in the store, so we happily roamed around and explored all the goodies.   One of my favorite things at Duck and Decanter is their huge selection of fancy meats and cheeses you can try and purchase. There were so many that I never even knew existed and t made me want to try them all! Next time I make a meat and cheese platter I will be purchasing it all here; the staff were so helpful and told me all of their favorites and recommendations.   The atmosphere is rickety and warm; it's completely unique and makes you want to find the perfect spot to enjoy your meal and have some \"you\" time or meet a friend. It's a really cool environment that you can't find anywhere else. The prices are reasonable and actually probably cheaper than most other sandwich shops around. The quality of food is top notch and just about everything they make is delicious.   Duck and Decanter is a fantastic place to grab a bite to eat in a one of a kind environment. If you like a great sandwich, friendly people, and cool nick knacks then check this place out!",

Parking is plentiful as well. Walking through the door, you notice this to be a clean well kept shop. Right away, you see a nice selection of cheese that I want to eventually try! Their shop was fun to look around in and I took notice of several things that will eventually make it to my own house!

    "text": "Today was a whirlwind of a day. Before my husband and I set out on our groupon redeeming adventure all over Phoenix, we decided to stop in here for lunch. This is the first time I have been in here to eat since becoming vegetarian almost a year and a half ago, and before then we used to come in all of the time. At least once a month to get some sandwiches while we were out shopping in this part of town. Today I decided would be a good day to check this place back out, as I was craving sandwiches anyways. We must have come in at an off time because it wasn't very crowded. But then again, most people don't eat lunch at 3pm. There was a musician playing out on the patio for a few guests.  We walked in and my husband and I both decided on the Where's the beef? sandwich, which was lettuce, tomato, avocado, jicama, celery, sprouts, cucumber, swiss cheese, mayo and mustard. I got mine on an onion roll and my husband decided on whole wheat. We paroozed the store while we were waiting for our sandwiches and we also purchased a large bottle of water and chips. There is also a little section inside where you can purchase teas, coffees, jams, spices, oils, kitchen tools, among other items. I can't say that I have ever bought any of these items but some of them are pretty interesting. Today I saw boxed potatoes. I don't know why but I thought it was the strangest thing ever.   Anyways. So our sandwiches are ready and we pay and we sat upstairs overlooking the rest of the store. I dig into my sandwich and I really love it. I'm a sandwich slut anyways so its easy to make me happy, but there were a ton of veggies. I didn't feel like I was gipped at all. Most sandwich places will give you the flattest sandwich possible. But this one was large and in charge. I got full half way through and still ate the whole thing because of how good it tasted. I think the value for a sandwich like this is just about the same as every other sandwich shop I have had that has a vegetarian option. It was $7, which is about average. So I don't feel like I was robbed or anything. We will definitely be back soon!",

Pork roast rubbed with southwestern spices, pulled and marinated in a jalapeno and onion barbeque sauce. Topped with the Duck's famous coleslaw. Served on onion roll. Is your mouth watering yet?  There's a lil something for everyone on this menu; from your True carnivores to your dedicated vegetarians.   Aside from the amazing food the ambiance is just awesome. You can either take a seat out on the patio (which you pass by on your way in) or you can sit anywhere theres a table and chair inside. My fave spot, is back by the wine cellar and beers. Yes! that's right if you'd like you can purchase a bottle of your liking to go or have the bartender there open it for you to enjoy with your lunch.   They also have a great lil store area to pick from herbal teas, to handmade cards and organic rices. Great place overall and I just can't wait to introduce someone to it so they can enjoy it as much as I have.",

That's the only reason I didn't turn around and walk out upon entering.  The decor in this place is cluttered, old, and feels dirty.  They sell most of their \"decorations\" and if you are looking for a basket from 1984 you will surely find one. The floors, the tables, the walls - everything just looks old and worn.  I don't find that particularly appetizing.    So I figured, this place must make one hell of a sandwich to keep such a high reputation, and placed my order.  While very nice, the staff is s...l...o...w...    I ordered the briesciutto.  I figured brie, prosciutto, sun dried tomatoes - can't mess that up, right?  Wrong.  The French bread was hard as a rock and was way too much bread.  The sun dried tomatoes were huge, but overpowered everything else.  I couldn't taste the brie or the prosciutto.     For what I paid and what I've heard, I had expected much better.  I was very disappointed in the entire experience.  My overall recommendation: just go across the parking lot to Einstein's.",

There are a lot of side items to choose from as well like potato salad, pasta, etc. I am a huge fan of their iced coffee! It also doubles as a store so you can find cute little trinkets and unique grocery items. Hey, if you want chips or candy with your sandwich, you can pick it off the shelf and enjoy it then. They even have a little doggie station with treats and a water bowl.",

    "text": "Duck and Decanter is more than just a sandwich shop for me.  As a young girl, I would frequently come to D&D with my dad. We would always get sandwiches, and I would be allowed to get a prize from the toy chest (not sure if they have it anymore). It was a place where we got to spend time together and bond, which was rare because as an  OB/GYN, my dad was frequently on call and at work.   I was pleased to recently find out that after all of these years, Duck and Decanter has not lost its honey feel, warm ambiance, and quality of their food.   This June, I took my dad there for Father's Day lunch. The sandwiches were as good as I remember. Nothing extravagant or peculiar, just classic sandwiches. Fresh breads, crispy lettuce, vine ripened tomatoes (among other things) and yummy mayonnaise. Not to mention their meat is very high quality and fresh-- all still at the amazing quality I remember as a young girl- fantastic.   The staff is nice, helpful and super friendly. They give the place a warm feel to it.   While you're there, make sure to shop around a bit, as they do have quite a few little trinkets and specialty food items like hot sauces, chocolates, and jams. All of their items are fairly moderately priced as well.   To eat, you can either go upstairs to their loft area, sit on their tucked away yet lively patio, or in the lobby area of the restaurant. All places are nice, clean, and family friendly!   Duck and Decanter is truly a great place to get a great quality sandwich and spend some quality time with the family.",

    "text": "This place is unlike any other. First of all, the name is unusual. The restaurant is tucked away and has trees surrounding the building. It almost feels like you're away from Arizona. The place is set up like a deli but also like a small store and a coffee bar and an art gallery and a patio space...super unique. I love the selection of foods and beverages. Ordering is simple (that is when you know what you want) and you have a chance to browse through the aisles as you wait for your order. They also have a loft space upstairs to enjoy your food but there's seating downstairs and outside on multiple patios. Perfect place for a weekday lunch or a brunch with your friends.",

    "text": "I have never been here before so I didn't know what to expect.  Every time I heard the name \"Duck & Decanter\"  I would picture a nice sit-down joint with waiters and pictures of hunting stuff on hunter green walls.  This is certainly not the case I realized upon entering.  It is just a sandwich place that also sells a bunch of random bric-a-brac.  It is all basically picnic stuff I think.  I dunno...it was real difficult to get a feel for the place.  It was all pretty random to me.  But anyway, about the food....  I ordered \"The Duckling\" sandwich was is one of their \"signature sandwiches\".  It seemed like a good selection because the name of the sandwich and the sandwich itself had duck in it and so does the name of the restaurant.  However, the sandwich was just ok.  Nothing special.  Not worth 9 bucks.  just a few slices of meat in between 2 pieces of bread.  All the sandwiches on the menu did however look interesting.  They are definitely not your typical \"sandwich place\" type sandwiches.  Well some of them are but they all have that special Duck & Decanter twist.  The have some deli type sandwich selections as well but I would prefer to just go to a deli for those.  My wife ordered the chicken salad and it was very very good.  I would order it if I ever visit the place again.  She ordered the Sonoran with spicy oil & vinegar.  It was very tasty and no mayo or any of the bad stuff.  The service was very friendly but I took a long while to get our sandwiches.  There must have been a large order ahead of us or something because there weren't many people in the place.  I couldn't imagine going here on a weekday during the  lunch rush because the line would likely be out the door and would take forever to get your food.  Luckily for me I went on a hot Sunday afternoon.",

If you're going because you're hungry and you want value, this isn't your place.  If you're going to hang with friends to relax and enjoy the day, I think you'll enjoy the place.",

    "text": "I met a friend the other day at Duck and Decanter. I had always wondered about this place because, an East Coast transplant, I assumed that it was some kind of a pub/restaurant typical of big Northeast cities. It was the name that threw me. I was completely taken by surprise when I entered. It is a deli/market/bakery combo. Think Cracker Barrel merged with Le Grand Orange sprinkled with Which Wich. Fascinating concept!  The sandwich that I ordered was delicious and I took a heap of pickles that come with. I managed to avoid buying anything else like chips or baked goods, but did so with a sad heart. Everything looked wonderful. My friend and I had a great lunch and leisurely talked for hours. No wait staff came to give us dirty looks or cleared our plates as we took our last bites. It was a good experience and I will definitely come again. Next time I will eat some sweets, browse the store, sit on the patio with my dog, and listen to the music outside - of course, not all at once.",

    "text": "I must say I can't believe I have not yet written a review on The Duck yet. As literally one of my favorite places in town one would think it would be at the top of my to do list. Maybe it is my secret desire to keep it a secret, as best as I can, so that it does not turn into a zoo everyday and I can't get my yummy sammies.   It is also extremely surprising to me that some have gone to lengths of posting a negative review of The Duck. It seems that in those cases they are wanting The Duck to be something it's clearly not; a mainstream-mass production-delivary running-squeeky clean-just-like-every-there kinda place. If that's what you are looking for then I would suggest going to AJ's, they might be a better fit for you.  Duck and Decanter has been around for longer than I have been around. They have won award after award for the best sandwich in town. I am surprised Kanye hasn't busted in on a subway commercial and told Jared that he would let him finish, but Duck and Decanter has the best stuff EVER! It has a homey feel, that makes you almost say (as Jeff L. put it) \"Am I still in Phoenix?\"   They have daily soups and special sandwiches. Their cheese is out of this world, the best provolone I have ever had for sure. They slice all their meat in house and very thin, perfect! I would tell you what sammy is my favorite, but that list would go on way too long. Turkey on a croissant, bree with roasted red peppers and prosciutto, garlic chicken salad, BLT....   The Duck is the perfect spot to have lunch out on the patio on a sunny Saturday or Sunday. They have a musician playing music most of the time and sometimes even have cute little farmers markets and art fests. It is perfectly tucked back in the shopping center with Sports Authority shielding you from the hustle and bustle. There is a fun grass area for pets and children to run around on. They also have some great knickknack shopping available to pa-ruse while you wait for your food. They have all kinds of coffee, tea, dishware, cookware, marinades, candy, drinks, wind chimes, magnets, jewelry, specialty gifts, and so on and so on. You can also call ahead and reorder to avoid the sometimes very long line.   Have fun!",

(Made with Maple Glazed Ham, Pinenuts, Spinach, Sliced Apples, Duck and Decanter's Famous Cheddar Cheese Spread on Multigrain.)  I like this place because I always know what I want (see above), and anyone I bring with me can always find something that fits their tastes, too. For the indecisive bunch, Duck & Decanter offers a list of signature sandwiches with the ingredients already listed. And for the pickier, er, more decided folks, D&D can make custom sandwiches, too -- you can choose your bread, meat, and toppings.  The ready-made pastas and other sides here are delicious, too, but I rarely get them, because their sandwiches are already so filling!  **Helpful Hint: You must, must, must either beat the lunch crowd or postpone your visit until after the lunch hour, otherwise you'll be at the end of a very long line.**",

I started out a bit crabby because several employees walked by me without acknowleding that I was standing in front of the \"order here\" sign.  But any annoyance immediately disappeared upon my first bite of my sandwich.  They were out of their normal bread so they offered me ciabatta.  I would never order it different, the bread, cream cheese and meat was a perfect combination.  It just might be on my top 10 sandwiches of all time list.  Their patio was pretty crowded since apparently they have live music quite often, so I ended up eating upstairs.  It was actually much cooler upstairs than downstairs so I highly recommend it on hot days.",

I got the D.A.M sandwich and macaroni salad. The sandwich was delicious. Pullpork in a not super sticky, more savory, bbq sauce, cole slaw on top on an onion roll. This place can definitely do pulled pork correctly, it was a tiny bit dry, but still great flavor and piled high. The macaroni salad was whatever. A lil too mayonaisey and not much flavor. I should have tried the pasta salad or one of the other variety of sides in the refridgerated section. You can also get kettle chips. They have fountain soda or bottled or glass/bottle wine available. Pricing seemed fair. Mine was 8 or 9 bucks for a 4oz side and a sandwich.   My cousin got the ham w/ spinach and some kind of mayo. She said it was good. And her friend got the sandwich with the genoa salami, she also said it wast tasty.  Theres plently of seating outside, a little cubby to the side of the stairs, and apparently seating upstairs as well.  When I am in town again I want to return to try another yumfest sandwich.

Most of the older, more established places really resonate with all of us, since we've frequented them so much throughout the years....or at least that is me. For those whom aren't from here, or do not know of Duck and Decanter, all you need to know is that this is THE ONLY BROWN BAG PLACE YOU NEED TO KNOW OF. Period.  **The Layout** As soon as you walk in, you see a number of things First you will notice the fun food items and nick-knacks on shelves, all usable and able to be purchased for use in your kitchen. Off to your left you will also see a coffee bar which is directly in front of the wine room. Each offer excellent products as well as experienced servers who can help you decide further. You also will see on the left wall a large selection of extremely high quality coffees from around the globe. Finally, to the right a large deli section with fridges filled with the same meats, cheeses, and sides you enjoyed in your sandwich  **Fud** The food is excellent, of course. Everything used is waaaaay above the quality of normal sandwich shops. You have a wide selection of fresh made pasta options as well as soups and other various sides. Its truly up to you to make your own brown bag special. My favorite is the Sonoran Chicken, with a wheat bread blend and swiss or provolone.... You can't go wrong with anything here guys. The staff work hard and care about your experience.  **What else?!?!** They have awesome music events planned out each week utilizing the patio out front. It is a two story building, so you can go upstairs and go up their for a group event if wanted.  ENJOY EVERYONE!!!!!!!",

It's a genuine hide away that gave me flashbacks of having lunch on my front lawn in the house I grew up in in western Oregon. Lush grass, big and plenty deciduous trees to provide plenty of shade and make that cool sound when a breeze comes through. It is very simple and tranquil to dine at. It also reminds me a lot of A.J.'s minus the grocery store and just offering quality coffee, wine, beer, sandwiches and sweets/desserts in a pleasant and classy atmosphere.  I got their special. So for Wednesday it was the \"Healthy Humpday\" which is half of a generously portioned ham sandwich, as well as a generous helping of salad also with a dill pickle on the side and a taffy in a brown paper bag. Totaling a little over $4.50. Then I made my way over to the bar area and got a 12oz craft beer for their happy hour special of $3.00. So I basically got a generous quality lunch that left me stuffed and satisfied for $8.41 total. I was very impressed with everything and very much look forward to going back and eating there again.",

    "text": "I love D&D and have been coming here for years.  It's always my go-to place for a nice deli sandwich in the Camelback Corridor.  I frequently get the creamy herb chicken salad on croissant and it's delicious everytime.  My husband craves the D.A.M. Sandwich: Pork roast rubbed with southwestern spices, pulled and marinated in a jalapeno and onion barbeque sauce. Topped with the Duck's famous coleslaw. Served on onion roll.  Yep, it sounds delish right?  My daughter usually gets the fruit salad or the pb & j but last time she tried the Trail Blazer Sandwich: Cream cheese, apple slices, grated carrot and trail mix on cranberry walnut bread.  Sure, it's healthy but she only ate one bite!  Maybe a bit too healthy for my 8 year old, oh well.  I tried it and it was a bit too \"granola\" for me too.  Oh, and you can order with ease online and skip a bit of the wait - even during a busy lunch.  We also like the choice of beverages, chips and snacks but they are a bit pricey (some specialty bottled sodas or waters are almost $3!).  For the occassional picnic though it's a delightful treat!  Also, if you have a child, don't forget to sign up on their website for the kids club - the kids get to pick an item out of the Treasure Chest on each visit.  Just another cheap little trinket to step on late at night or get lost in the couch, but the kids love it!  Don't we all love a freebie?!?  Thanks D&D!!",

    "text": "One of my all time favorite places.The duck offers more than just delicious sandwiches; they offer excellent coffee, a more extensive tea selection than you'll see from other coffee-type shops, and PRIME space for *~you~* time.   If you are looking for a place to nestle into, whether it be for a meeting, some hardcore studying, or even a board game, THIS IS YOUR PLACE. I've literally seen people playing board games in one of the nooks. This place has expansive space which allows customers to branch out across the two stories.  You'll see that it's almost treehouse-esque. There's wood everywhere and you walk up and down rickety stairs to get to the upstairs loft/patio. They have a lovely outdoor seating area and again, the space for focus and meetings is unparalleled. I typically spend about 5+ hours here when I come and I see the morning flow (pretty slow and tranquil) then I see the lunch rush. Sure, it gets busy, but I bring my headphones which gets me through that period of crowdedness. The staff doesn't hover around you or make you feel unwelcome when you spend a lot of time there, which I certainly appreciate. They are actually very friendly and helpful.  The place is quite old and could possibly use some updates (computer outlets, tables and chairs, etc). However, I kinda like the shabbiness of it.   Prices are typical for lunch/coffee. The first time I tried this spot, my dirty chai was eh. It was luke-warm and just not very good. I'm glad I gave it another try because in my most recent 6 visits, I haven't had a bad experience!   Highly recommend",

Upstairs is a nice variety of seating where it is quiet enough to hold a small meeting or read or just enjoy conversation with a friend. The large windows let in plenty of day light and the nature photos on the walls are just spectacular. If you have a need for a kitchen gadget or a small gift, it's also worth perusing their market. Yesterday a local musician performed while a number of people sat outside with their lunch or wine glass. If you've ever heard of biophilic design, this place has it and I believe it is why people feel so comfortable here. By the way, their soups, sandwiches and salads are very good. The counter help is friendly and if you're in the area, it should be your go to sandwich spot.",

While you're waiting for your order, grab a table out on the patio or browse the shop for local foods, jams, honeys, or spices as well as cookbooks and other tchotchkes.

However, what it lacked in sized, it made up in taste! This tightly rolled burrito was bursting with flavor and the crispy delicious bacon was a constant exclamation point throughout the burrito.

I was worried they wouldn't have anything for me, but after asking some questions I realized my options were quite large. Almost all of their breads are vegan, with the exception of the onion/ Kaiser roll(double check me on that) and they offer hummus as a spread if you want to opt out of the mayo. They also have oil and vinegar to spice up your sandwich if you want something different. You can customize your own sandwich and sub avocado as a meat, or simply go with one of my new favs which is called Where's the Beef. It is packed with avocado, Sprouts, lettuce, tomatoes, celery, cucumbers, and pine nuts. It's absolutely amazing!! If you're vegetarian, you can pretty much have any of the sandwiches and just get it without the meat. If you're vegan, you still have a ton of options it just requires you to be more creative. Honestly, all of the staff is more than willing to help you find your perfect sandwich. This place is awesome! Their beverage selection is amazing as well! They offer a nice selection of beer, wine, tea, soda, and coffee. You name it, they probably have it! There is plenty of seating if you plan on hanging with friends, and a nice section upstairs if you want to just study. There outdoor seating is just lovely on the perfect day. If sandwiches are your thing they offer cheese plates, salads, and delicious desserts!",

Not only do they have a great menu, but the environment and vibe is also awesome. This hidden gem reminds me of a log cabin that just happens to be a restaurant. They have a little gift shop in the restaurant and they always have the coolest kitchen gadgets and nic-nac gifts.    My favorite sandwich is the Genoa. This masterpiece.... Genoa salami, herb and garlic cream cheese, marinated tomatoes, spinach on a French roll.  I've a had almost all the sandwiches.... Some other note worthy options are....  - \"the duckling\" - smoked turkey and duck breast with a cranberry relish,  watercress on a raisin bread.  -\"briesciutto\" - sun dried tomato spread, prosciutto, Brie cheese, and your choice of bread. I also like to add spinach.  -albacore tuna is also awesome!   There are several more options that are fantastic but too many to name. Come check this place out and sit upstairs to see some local art or come on in when they have live music (Fridays I think). This is a great place to take out of towners.",

    "text": "It honestly hurts me to have to leave a one star review for this place, considering I know the family who started and owns the business rather well and they are very good people. I've been eating here since I was 12 years old, and when I grew older and lived in the neighborhood I ate there almost once a week, many times even daily. Clearly, I'm not even exaggerating a little when I say that I love this place and think the food is amazing. Lately, however I have been experiencing a lot of issues with my orders being made improperly and a lack of support from the staff in compensation for the issue.  I haven't eaten there for a long time, it might be my actual favorite place to eat and for the most part if I could eat anything at all this is what I would choose, so I recently decided to place an order. I got home with my food and realized that everything was made improperly. I called them before they closed to make sure they knew what happened and they gave me credits for free food.  After remembering how good their food is, despite the mistakes made to my order, I was left craving more and decided to try again so I could use the free credits they gave me. When I got home the food was made incorrectly again, but I live far and really didn't feel like driving back, so I picked everything off that wasn't supposed to be there and moved on with my day.  Soon after I took a friend of mine there because she had never been and despite these two past experiences I still considered it my favorite place to eat. We ordered, waited, got our food, and sat down. I opened my sandwich to find it made incorrectly, yet again. After becoming quite sad, my friend encouraged me to go back inside and tell them. They remade the sandwich for me and everything was fine.  Because of my recent issues, when I placed my latest order, I made sure to ask the person taking my order to have the person making the sandwich double-check the bag to insure my food was made exactly as I ordered it. He assured me that he would, and when I picked up my food he confirmed with me that he did indeed check. Unfortunately when I got home I found that my food was made wrong, surprise! AGAIN.  I reached my breaking point and called asking to speak with a manager. I gave her an in-depth explanation of the situation just as mentioned above and asked if it'd be possible to be refunded for today's food and was told that she'd need to look more seriously into the matter and call me back the next day to let me know what she'd be able to do for me. I'm still waiting to hear from her, hopefully I'll be able to change this review when I do.",

    "text": "I have been coming here for 20+ years and it used to be so much better.     I placed a to go order last Saturday and the place that used to have a line out the door was dead.   The  selection of sides/salads is much smaller than it used to be and every side had a 'crust' over them like they had been made and sitting out since the day before.   It was so unappealing that I really regretted ordering the macaroni salad (which indeed was average tasting at best.)  The sandwich I had, 'The Whole Thing' was very good.   My husband thought the 'Fiery Italian' was pretty nondescript and ended up throwing out half of it.  The outdoor seating area is nice, as are the servers.   I just wish the quality of the food hadn't slipped so much.",
