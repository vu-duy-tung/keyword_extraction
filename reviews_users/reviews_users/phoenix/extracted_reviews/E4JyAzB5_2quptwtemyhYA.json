A little north of downtown (11 miles or so) but well worth the trip, plus it's not like there's any traffic to really keep you from not going here. We started with the Brioche Cinnamon Rolls, let me tell you...heaven. We then got the Country Apple Sausage Scramble and the French Toast Combo. The coffee was good and the fresh squeezed orange juice was such a thirst quencher. The food was AMAZING!!!!!  Definitely a must when in the Phoenix area.",

Super friendly staff and some very delicious selections.  I guess they're know for their French toast and it is amazing - maybe better than Juniors in NYC - certainly just as good!!!

When we did get our table it was probably one of the worst ones in the restaurant right in the flow of traffic. I asked the waitress if we could please have a booth which they did find us one. That was nice. It was very busy and quite loud in there. I'm not complaining about it I would just be warned if you're someone who prefers a more quiet restaurant. Also it was Veterans Day so it was like I said, really busy.  My mom and I both ordered a cup of coffee. It was pretty good I still prefer Crepe Bar's coffee. My mom also ordered the fresh orange juice. That was excellent!  They even give you a free refill. It is a bit pricey however.   My mom ordered the French toast with scrambled egg and sausage. She like the French toast, but I didn't care for it.  it was deep-fried I found it to be way too heavy and very greasy just wasn't my style. My mom said the sausage was good I didn't try it.  We both agreed that the scrambled egg was delicious!  I really like how they prepared the egg. I could've gotten some more eggs but I was already getting full.   I ordered the blueberry pancakes. They were very good.  I do like the little hint of lemon in them. I thought they could've had a little bit more blueberries though. We both payed the extra dollar to have the real maple syrup.   Overall this is a good breakfast place. It's hard to come here and not over order. I left feeling way too full. I think I am just not a fan of big heavy breakfasts, but I do appreciate this place and their quality. I would go back for the scrambled eggs, and those cinnamon rolls looked really good!",

The food was amazing BUT to get my daughter two scrambled eggs and two pieces of sausage it ended up costing more then my omelet! Then I had to change her diaper, I asked if they had a changing table in their bathroom? They said No. seriously?! So we went out to the car I changed my daughters diaper, then I went inside their restaurant went to the bathroom and left her poopy diaper at the bottom of the trash! So seriously if u want to be a great restaurant be more \"baby\" friendly & install some diaper changing tables, babies gotta use the restroom too :) I will say again though, the food was DELICIOUS!!",

I love this place because the pricing is very reasonable...not to mention the portions are are on the larger side.   I got the Chicken Fried Chicken with two eggs. Except I subbed the eggs with hash browns. The meal also came with a deep fried french toast...yummmmmmmmmmy, The hash browns are just perfect... not too oily and crispy. Looks like that is how they cook it, so if you prefer your hash browns on the mushy side, better let them know before placing your order! The entree came with TWO crispy fried chicken. The chicken is breaded and covered in a thick gravy sauce. I could barely finish the first chicken slab....holy cow. It was perfectly breaded and crispy and moist. The french toast with butter and syrup (came as a side) was also delicious. It was the perfect texture of crispy and soft.   I definitely recommend the freshly squeezed OJ for $3.75. It also comes with one FREE refill. The OJ is pulpy, sweet and just a perfect balance to that heavy breakfast meal.   You grab your ticket receipt and pay at the front.   Service was also great. Thank you!",

Portions are generous, prices are of great value. Service was great as well. Can't wait to go back and try other items on their menu.   Their lineups is a testament to their ethos, and a sure sign they are doing something special. Enjoy it as these kind of restaurants are not easy to find. You are so lucky to have one in Phoenix!!",

    "text": "One of my favorite breakfasts of ALL TIME!!!  I'm not even exaggerating.  I loved everything about my first experience here.  The food was of phenomenal quality.  The staff was impossibly friendly and smiling at all times.  The atmosphere as a whole was incredibly welcoming and comfortable.  In many ways Original Breakfast House (OBH) is amazing because of how simple and old fashioned their approach is.  They put their own twists on some of their breakfast fare, but a lot of what you're getting here is just what you'd normally expect, only better.  Allow me to elaborate.  The Arizona Restaurant Association (known as the creators of the wildly popular Arizona Restaurant Week) decided to give the breakfast crowd some love by rolling out their first annual Arizona Breakfast Weekend in late summer.  Similar to Restaurant Week, a number of valley restaurants roll out breakfast specials at discount prices to entice the masses.  Among the entrants this year was OBH.  I'd tried dining at OBH two years ago on a Saturday, but the line was so long it would've make Matt's Big Breakfast blush.  So I took a pass.  This time, I took no chances.  When I drove to 32nd Street & Thunderbird this time, I made sure to arrive right at their 6:30am opening on Saturday morning.  Fortunately I was able to get a seat quite easily this time around.  A quick note that they have a breakfast bar area up front if you're like me and coming here by yourself (though this time they gave me my own booth in the corner).    Most of OBH's breakfast fare is your traditional stuff.  Omelettes, pancakes, biscuits, potatoes, etc.  Today for Arizona Breakfast Weekend however they had a special dish that immediately had my name all over it.  A three egg omelette stuffed with crab and jack cheese and topped with a hollandaise sauce.  Yes please.  The dish also came with potatoes any style (I went hash browns), plus a bread of choice (I went with their house made buttermilk biscuit).  Since I'm a sucker for brioche bread and cinnamon rolls, I also got (appropriately enough) one of their house made brioche cinnamon rolls.  I also got two servings of their fresh squeezed orange juice to boot.  Total cost for all the food, tax, and tip came to about $25.  For starters, yes the OJ is great.  I'm not a fan of orange pulp, but the juice was so good I didn't even care this time around.  Let's talk about this omelette.  They did not mess around with the portion of crab.  Holy moly the crab meat must've been close to an inch diameter inside that omelette.  No complaints here as both the crab and hollandaise sauce were both incredibly rich and decadent.  Amazing dish.  Most people probably would be full after they had this, but I pressed on because, well, I had more delicious food right in front of me.  The hash browns were good as well, but pretty much like most hash browns you've had elsewhere.  The biscuit came with a side of butter and strawberry preserves.  The biscuit was incredibly flaky and buttery by itself so there was almost no point to adding even more butter.  But with a dollop of their house strawberry preserve on top?  Just fantastic.  Lastly, there's the brioche cinnamon roll.  I probably would've eaten a whole batch of these if they put it in front of me.  They didn't skimp on the icing on this thing, but the star of this dish was the bread itself.  There's just something about the light, puffy, buttery texture of brioche that always ropes me in.  Combined with cinnamon and warm icing and I'm basically in fat kid heaven.    As mentioned earlier the staff here was incredibly friendly, smiling, and energetic (almost alarmingly so) despite being so early on a Saturday.  By the time I left around 7am, the place was starting to fill up.  In talking to the staff, it sounds like getting here before 8am is the optimal time to avoid a wait.  The place can seat a lot of people, but I can see why even a breakfast spot this big still commands a line.  Huge props to John Stidham who came out of retirement to bring this little corner of an otherwise nondescript shopping center to life and gave the Phoenix area an incredible breakfast gem.  What a meal.  What an experience.",

    "text": "Breakfast House is one of my favorite breakfast restaurants. The customer service is great always greeted with a smile and a warm welcome hello. There is plenty of room so it doesn't feel so crowded, but keep in mind this place is pretty popular so sometimes there is waiting lines. However I've never waited any longer than 30 minutes. To be honest it's so worth the wait. The food always comes out at the perfect temperature. There is just about a little bit of everything from your typical breakfast plates of eggs, sausage or ham with pancakes on the side to El Paso omelettes  with sour cream and guacamole. Also I'm so happy they finally added new coffee options for all the coffee addicts like myself. There is the cold brew and the frapp coffee. I have to admit I wasn't a fan of the cold brew it tasted a little water down. It was like making coffee and putting ice and then when I added cream and sugar wasn't as strong as I would like my coffee. Also I tried the frapp and I usually like the taste of this one more, but this time I didn't like that the mixed used wasn't blended well. I could feel the grittiness in my mouth. They do need to step it up in regards to there iced coffees, but I can see there heading towards the right direction. (-1 star) Overall I really recommend this place for breakfast or brunch. Also a heads up the restaurant will no longer take credit or debit cards ONLY cash starting September 1st. I know that might be an inconvenience, but the good thing is that there will be an ATM. Don't let that discourage you. Stop by and see what everyone is talking about!",

I think we waited about 30 minutes for our table which wasn't too bad all things considered. Our server was extremely friendly and fast on getting us refills and explaining the menu, specials and answering any questions we had.   I ordered the chicken fried chicken with eggs and french toast along with a cinnamon roll. The cinnamon roll was outstanding. It's a good size too, not small and not \"Oh shit, I guess I'm passing pieces out to the other tables\" big. The french toast was very dense and tasty. One piece is plenty and stupid me ordered 2, which I couldn't finish. The eggs were also very good (some places DO have bad eggs) as was the chicken and sausage gravy. Everything seemed homemade and I would be very interested in going back to try their lunch items, but they're spot on for breakfast, so go just for that.",

My girlfriend ordered the same. We were both sick the entire day. Either the bacon was cooked poorly or they were using bad oil on the bacon but something wasn't right.",

Delicious with either the regular or special syrup, this is a must if you haven't had deep fried french toast in the past - tasted like something out of a State Fair from long ago. Portion was huge and I didn't finish it, nor did I need the side of eggs and bacon I ordered with it. Hot chocolate was a fun, whip creamed treat and the biscuits & gravy earned raved reviews from a very particular eater. Come and support this lovely gem!",

Decided to treat ourselves and yelped best breakfast and after scrolling  and scrolling we came across this gem! So glad we did and didn't keep scrolling because everyone says it's crowded with a wait. We knew we would have to wait and it actually wasn't that bad at all! The 20-25 minutes flew by and we were seated and excited to order! I indulged in the pictured Blackberry French Toast with a side of eggs and bacon and a coffee.....all were simply AMAZING!!!! That French Toast was huge and sooooo so very delicious...of course I couldn't finish it. The coffee was so mellow and great as well...great flavor! My husband ordered the Banana Pecan Pancakes with a side of eggs, sausage and home fries....he was so very impressed! Absolutely delicious! The home fries could have been a little more crispy to his liking but they had great flavor and were still yummy! He had the fresh squeezed OJ and although not a fan of pulp he still loved it over some ice and it was awesome that it comes with one free refill which was perfect. My 4yr old killed her kids pancakes and bacon...I never seen her eat so much for breakfast and washed it down with organic apple juice. I took props for my stellar breakfast find and we will definitely be back our next time in AZ!!! OBH is bomb!!!!! Oh and absolutely excellent and friendly service! Well ran establishment!!",

She gave outstanding service. She did not kick me out either when I got to the part of my book that I just could not put down. I am sure I overstayed my welcome. First world reader problems. lol. In fact everyone who stopped by my table was delightful.  If I lived nearby I honestly would be here every day.   I know this is random but it touched a nice memory. I laughed out loud and smiled so big when I saw that they have fried Bologna sandwiches on the menu. What a flash from my past, growing up in NY,  grandpa-litte girl spending time together memory there. Not sure I would order it as an adult nowadays though despite the waitress saying it is great and popular. Maybe one day when I am feeling especially nostalgia i will come by and try one.   Thanks for a nice meal and great service OBH!",

Fortunately for us and our hungry stomachs, we were sat after 30 minutes of waiting. Our server Divina was the sweetest. She was super attentive and helpful when we were deciding what to eat. I ended up going with the two slices of French toast with strawberries and whipped cream, and my BF went with the El Paso omelette. Both portions are massive and can be easily shared. Their french toast is so decadent. They deep fried them and they are made with sourdough. Super filling and sweet! The El Paso omelette comes with two sides as an option and we opted for the hash browns and toast. The toast comes with a homemade jam. They also have a freshly squeezed orange juice that is a must when you go. This place is awesome, but seems to always have a wait so plan ahead.",

They have a hint of lemon in them, and I am bound and determined to recreate these since we live in Chandler and can't come here EVERY weekend.  I can promise you though that we will be back.   I also don't remember out servers name, but she was the genuinely nicest person that I have ever dealt with.  My boyfriend and I typically have something to say about our servers that we don't like, but we couldn't find ANYTHING wrong with her, she was so sweet, I wish I knew her name to give her a shout out.  And shout out the the owners for having a super clean restaurant and from what I could see kitchen too!  All in all... make the drive, go eat here, it is awesome, and inexpensive.  Definitely get their pancakes  :)",

    "text": "I drove forever and a day to get here with the promise that it was an excellent place for brunch. It was! The food and service were fantastic and the experience was well worth the drive. The surprisingly young group of management running the restaurant are so hospitable and caring; it's definitely a diamond in the rough.  My friend ordered a hearty looking breakfast sandwich special with fried potatoes and pico de gallo. She inhaled it happily. I chose the breakfast special: Short stack - (2) fluffy, lightly lemon-tasting pancakes, 2 pork sausages and 2 poached eggs. Everything was excellent, especially the pancakes and sausages. The staff was very attentive down to the detail on exactly how I liked my eggs prepared.   By the time I realized I should take a photo for Yelp, I looked down at a completely empty plate. Oops :)  The location is very close to the 51 freeway on the SE corner of 32nd Street and Thunderbird in an unassuming strip mall.  The venue is powerchair/wheelchair accessible, including spacious restrooms.  Two thumbs up!",

I had no problem with it because as I said, they have two free ATMs in the restaurant. The french toast is phenomenal. All of our other food was very good, but this surfer vibe breakfast place is rightly famous for its French Toast. Don't miss it. Don't worry about waiting. They're always busy but they have a small indoor waiting area and a large outdoor waiting area that is shaded and they provide cold bottles of water while you wait. When in Phoenix, go here for breakfast.",

They said it'd be a 15-20m wait but actually we got in after about 7 minutes!    We went because I was in the mood for a big ole cinnamon bun and I'd read good reviews about theirs so we ordered that, the breakfast tacos and the biscuits and gravy.   The waitress was very attentive and efficient. Super friendly without being \"much\". The food was out pretty quickly. Our favorite was the biscuits and sausage gravy. Biscuits were moist and the gravy had a perfect flavor. The breakfast tacos were also pretty good. Super large and filling. Only thing I'd want is a better (thicker) flour tortilla. The most disappointing part of the meal was the cinnamon bun we came for. It was just average and the outer layers were dry.   Overall a solid place that I'd go back to!",

It's really hard to mess up breakfast but a lot harder to make breakfast really good. My meal was the bomb and my buddy got the French toast which was huge and luckily more than enough for him which meant more for me. The service was great and the food was delicious.",

Between the two of us, we split the chorizo burrito and french toast with strawberries. GREAT decision. Both dishes were excellent! Service was also excellent. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "My husband and I had breakfast here on a Saturday morning. It was predictably busy, but since we were ok with sitting at the counter, we didn't have to wait long at all. A few highlights:  - the cinnamon roll. warm, gooey, and crazy delicious. helps that I was hungry - a free refill on the fresh squeezed oj?! yes, please!! I got the refill to go (and pro tip - she gave me a little more to fill the cup all the way)  So the neighborhood perhaps isn't the greatest and the views aren't anything special, but there's plenty of convenient parking and I appreciate being able to get an awesome breakfast without having to drive all the way to Scottsdale. So why only 4 stars? Hubby wasn't wowed. Maybe he didn't love the banana pancakes as much as he should have. I thought my popeye omlet was very tasty! Fast, friendly service and a decent sized menu that has all the things you'd want and more.",

First day was traditional eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and toast. Second day the el paso. Both the food and service was awesome. What was particularly interesting was that I sat at a booth and eavesdropped on a conversation between two men talking business. It turns out it was the owner! I have owned a business for over 15 years and I can attest the owner is very wise, compassionate, and truly believes in quality service. I am not only sold on the food and service, but on the vision of someone who has passion for what he does.",

The omelets have kinda weird ingredients and are very, very rich. Before going, I'd definitely give it a once over to make sure it has something you'll like.

The highlight of the meal was the hot sauce sitting on the table. I have used this sauce before (made in Gilroy, CA the garlic capital of the world, but a pepper base) and have not seen it for about 3 or 4 years, it was excellent.",

    "text": "I was hoping this place would be 5 stars, but I can only give 3. The service was good, although I felt the waitress spoke too quietly and too fast when describing the specials. She also had way too much cleavage showing for a family restaurant. I opted to just get short-stack pancakes and hashbrowns since I wasn't super hungry. I judge pancakes on one simple thing... are they delicious when eaten with just butter? Yes, the certainly are! There is a hint of lemon in these and it's wonderfully unique. I asked for them to be a little overcooked (which they did, yay!) and they were still nice and fluffy. I also like that they use Mrs. Butterworth's syrup. It's my favorite! The hashbrowns on the other hand... unique, but not in a good way. It almost seemed like mashed potatoes were flattened in a pan and fried until brown on top and bottom. They were $3 for a small serving. I hardly ever send food back, but after two bites, I really did not want to pay for them! Cold, odd texture... just not good. My boyfriend ordered the french toast combo plate with scrambled eggs and bacon. The french toast looked amazing, but honestly, kind of reminded me of funnel cake (which I don't care for) because it's deep fried. Prices were reasonable for the most part, but I have a feeling they've gone up since some of the pics were posted on yelp. My pancakes were over $6 for just two (nothing else included). All in all, I will definitely give this place another try, but I'm still searching for breakfast perfection.",

We found this place through Groupon and we were happy to find something close to our house and close to the kids swim lessons place. How convenient for a sat morning post swim! We gave it a shot and thought it was just ok. The food was mediocre at best and the service was below average. We knew they had just opened so we wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt.   We went again today and had an even worse experience. First off, my four year old ordered a waffle and the server told us they don't have waffles there! WHAT?!? Isn't that a pretty basic breakfast staple? Then we noticed three dead flies in the window sill. Gross. Not to mention all of the flies flying around the restaurant (this is because they leave the back door to the restaurant open- my guess is because the bathrooms have this horrible smell). The food came and again, it was lackluster. My husband's omelette was burned. Two hot plates were placed right in front of my one year old- common sense people! Once the food was dropped the server never came by our table again. The only thing that was good was the orange juice and that they offer a free refill- that's if you can get one. Our server walked right by and watched me take my last sip of oj. I assumed she would bring another but I ended up asking a busser.   Once a fly landed in my daughters syrup and couldn't get out we decided we were done with this place. We then had to ask another server to find our server to bring our check.   Needless to say we will not be back. We will be going back to our favorite place that has waffles and great service! Might have a long wait to get in but now we know why.   It's too bad because this place has potential.",

Eggs, bacon, mushrooms, onions, and potatoes all scrambled up with a side of toast.  Her serving was HUGE! I took a few bites and really liked it.  She couldn't finish the meal.  The good news is that will be my breakfast the next day :) . My one son had the pancakes breakfast.  2 big pancakes with 2 eggs.  I tried his pancakes and they were really good.  The pancakes had lemon zest added which I have never had before but they were very tasty.  My son could barely finish the meal since it was a lot of food.  My other son had the kids chicken nuggets.  The nuggets were very good.  They were homemade chicken nuggets.  I tried those also and they were definitely yummy.  The staff was very friendly.  Return factor is 100%  Only negative would be that it was a bit hot inside.  Either the air conditioning wasn't working properly or they had the temperature set too high.",

You can tell that they use fresh ingredients. They get pretty busy, especially weekends, but they do a very good job making your food quick so that the wait is as short as possible. They might be my favorite breakfast spot in Phoenix. There are places whose pancakes I Iike more(not a shot at their pancakes, they are very good) and there's probably places whose hash browns I like more, but as a whole this is my favorite breakfast spot. I have enjoyed everything on their menu that I've tried and I hope to be back soon!",

My only small complaint is sometimes when I get my food to go, by the time I get home the to go box is almost breaking because it absorbs the food. There are times it is lined with foil and that seems to really help, but when it's not it seeps through. I don't live to far but I imagine if I did it may possibly break through. Again this is a minimal complaint, the food is awesome!",

There are basic American dishes to suite those with a simple palate and plenty of sophisticated dishes for the foodies out there.

If you decide to check this place out there will probably be a wait. To me people waiting outside = probably a good place.  2. Bring your appitite as not only are there many choices for breakfast or lunch the portions are ample.  3. Last but not least, Service with a smile.  I have been here 3 times in the last month. No signs of slowing down in the future. Maybe you will see me happily enjoying the que waiting to order the French Toast or Chicken Fried Chicken.",

Because I didn't want to feel like a fatty, although I am one.  The El Paso has a generous amount of of chorizo which I was happy to see because most restaurants can be stingy with it. It also comes with cheddar cheese, black beans, and green chilies.  Surprisingly it's not as spicy as you would expect.    The service was very friendly. We were greeted within second of walking into the place and were sat quickly.  Keep in mind we came at 9am so the traffic is very low.  Our server was helpful and helped me identify a spice that I loved in the chorizo.  Overall I will be returning to this place for breakfast.  It's a bit of a drive for me, but I like it here.",

The Juan Tacos are robust in flavor, needing little to perfect them. I did sprinkle in a bit of the guac and salsa to try. Excellent stuff.  I fork sampled the El Paso (an omelette with chorizo and green chilis) and one of the specials, Triple Berry French toast. I'm happy to report that the chorizo was spicy and not overcooked. The french toast was deep fried. Perhaps a heart attack in the making but I'd definitely try that solo.  Portions here are large. Definitely shareable. But why would you do that?

The coffee is organic free trade. My partner had an omelet she really enjoyed, and I tasted some of her whole wheat toast and jelly which was wonderful. We will be putting this one in the rotation.",

They were chorizo and egg and they were delicious! I plan to go back and order her dish. Loved the fresh squeezed, pulpy OJ as well.  The only drawback was the service. Our waitress was terrible. Took our order and never came back. In fact someone else brought our food. I had to call out to get her to look at our table to get straws, napkins and refills after being ignored for twenty minutes. Granted it was Sunday morning and she was busy but she never glanced at the other tables when she came to her section. Passed my table 3 times and I wasn't able to waive her down that's how focused she was at ignoring her tables. I noticed her other tables having the same problem as well. Maybe as they are opened longer she'll get a better grasp on multi-tasking.  I'd give my experience 3.5 stars and round up because I think food is more important than service.",

Also, my daughter can be a bit of a handful when she is tired (we had just came from the playground and she had been riding in the bike trailer for a good portion of the morning), but the staff were very friendly and understanding and even played with her a bit.  Admittedly, it was a MOnday morning, so it was a bit slow, so not many people for my kid to annoy (if there had been I would have gotten her out of there so as not to ruin other peoples breakfasts).    I will definitely be back!  Probably with my wife this time too!",

There were at least six parties in front of us but we were seated in under 10 minutes. The atmosphere of the place is busy, bustling, and loud. I ordered the Cajun Andouille Sausage and Chedder Scramble and the wife ordered the Chicken Apple Sausage Scramble. Our order was on the table in under 5 minutes. We both opted for the home fries upon the recomendation of our server and they were very good. Perfectly seasoned with a firm crust on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside. We also both opted for a biscuit and paid extra for the gravy. Soooo worth it. Thier gravy was made from real sausage, slighty sweet with a hint of warm spices, fantastic. The scrambles were mostly large chunks of delicious and succulent sausage, with just the right amount of cage-free eggs and cheese. The coffee was good, standard higher end restaurant fare and the service was amazing. The servers and staff were fast, polite, and accomadating. We will be coming back!",

    "text": "I drive by this place every Sunday on my way to church, and for quite a while have been saying, \"Some day I need to stop and have breakfast there!\"  Well, this morning was the day, and all I can say is, \"Jackpot!!\"  I will definitely be back!  My breakfast, though \"simple\" (basic 2 scram, x-crispy bac, wheat toast & fresh fruit), was as satisfying in every aspect.  There's not much I can add to all the food complements from other reviewers here; I can only endorse and reiterate them.  You won't be disappointed!  What I would like to add is an extra complement from the restaurant management angle - something you don't always see on Yelp.  I took a counter seat right next to the kitchen.  Normally, because of noise and staff coming in and out right by you, that's a bad place to be.  Not in this case, because it gave me a bird's eye view of what an incredibly efficient, well-run place this is!  1. Everything organized in back.  All supplies, containers, dishware, what-have-you, neatly arranged on easy-access shelving, not a thing out of place.  With the level of activity at breakfast on Sunday morning, this area could easily get out of hand, with things in disarray.  Not here.  My own kitchen should look so well-organized!  2.  Clean as a whistle.  Again, with the hubbub and frantic pace, it would be understandable to have spills on the floors, shelves, counters, etc.  Spotless.  Looks like they just opened for their first day ten minutes ago.  To repeat, oh, that I should keep my own kitchen, for one person, looking so clean and tidy.  3.  Wait and bus staff HUSTLES!  No one is standing around not paying attention - these gals and guys are in perpetual motion!  I got tired just watching them.    4. Owner right there and involved.  Not lording it over his staff, but right there at their side, doing whatever needs to be done, whether it's bringing out an order, showing a party to their table, you name it - he's in the thick of it!  5. Fast and friendly!  I always allow extra time when trying a new place, because you just never know, but I was served within 3 or 4 minutes of placing my order, and on my way with lots of time to spare.  All staff were friendly and attentive.  The crew here deserves high accolades.  I look forward to many more visits.",

    "text": "If you're looking to open up a successful local restaurant, I suggest coming in here and taking detailed notes. But be sure that, while doing so, you're eating some of their deep fried French toast.  I remember dining at Original Breakfast House with my girlfriend during their earlier days. It was popular then and, over time, has become increasingly more popular to the point where wait times can sometimes be not what you'd expect for a place operating out of this area.  The thing is, the success is very well deserved.  Okay. So I'll openly admit, there are a few better breakfast places in Phoenix if we're going to talk about specific items. But the reason why I think OBH has continued to work so well is that, rather than putting so much emphasis one or two single items to sell the place, they manage to make consistently good food that has never disappointed either myself or my girlfriend.   Look at the wall photographs or read up on the restaurant's owner. The man has quite a history in the restaurant business and clearly knows exactly what he's doing. Plus, he always seems to be there, which doesn't seem to be the case for most places once they become so successful.  Do I like their adoption of a \"Cash Only\" policy? Honestly, I understand the logic, but still see it as a bit of an inconvenience considering I stopped carrying cash around 14 years ago. Personally, I'd be more content with just paying a \"convenience charge\" on my card, but oh well. If you look at the crowds, I'm pretty sure their loyal customers don't mind, even though I'd admittedly come a bit more often if it didn't require me to detour to my bank's ATM every time.  Note: There are ATM(s) on-site that are free to use - although most likely are not free from your own personal bank fees.  Anyway, I enjoy their little twists on traditional foods. My girlfriend typically orders their banana and pecan pancakes, while I always request a side of their deep fried French toast, regardless of what else I end up getting.   Servers are always prompt and pleasant. We've never ran into an any real issues. A request for hot coffee after the original pot was barely lukewarm was resolved without any fuss.  It's always nice to see local places like this grow to amass such a huge following. And I also think it serves as a very good example that you don't need a fully stocked bar with trendy mixologists, techno music, and over-the-top menu items in order to be successful.  Just serve good breakfast and do so consistently. I wish more places would mirror this approach.  Highly recommended!",

The gf got the chilaquiles.   I really liked my meal - it hit my breakfast spot that morning. Sausage, eggs, cheese, hash browns, and finished it with pancakes that had a little extra something.  The gf didn't really care for her meal though. It was a huge serving and a huge waste of food unfortunately. I didn't try much because I had my hands full with my breakfast so I can't comment, I can only report what she said. She said it was basically corn tortillas chips with green salsa and an egg on top. She said it was \"disjointed\" and not cooked together like she is used to.   Still I'd come back to try different food and I think she would too. It's cash only as other have stated - a little weird but luckily we had cash anyway and they have an ATM in the place.",

Although there is a large waiting area outside there really was nothing inside but one chair and maybe a two person seat. I stood holding my son in a very small crowded entry way for about 20 mins before a seat inside was available to sit. And then it was probably another 15 minutes before we were seated at our table. Luckily I saw the sign that said cash only while I was waiting and there was an ATM so I was able to get cash before we sat down. I can't remember the last time I've been to a cash only place. Our server was really sweet and the food was okay. I enjoyed the fresh squeezed orange juice with a free refill. If I come back it probably won't be until the weather is cooler so that I can wait outside if there is a wait.",

    "text": "I have come here every week 2-3 times a week for five years for business meetings and breakfast with my family every Sunday morning religiously.  Today, my meeting ran long and we were chatting for an hour after we were done eating.  The owner came over to us and asked us to leave.  He said, I am thankful for your business but hungry people are waiting.  I honestly couldn't believe it. I was SO incredibly embarrassed!  With as much business as I give them for them to boot us out?  It blew my mind.  I had just spent $50 on my tab.  I WILL NEVER RETURN.  This was my favorite breakfast place in the valley and I was a very loyal customer.  My guess is he did not care what the consequence of his actions were because he so confidently escorted us out the door.  Such a terrible display of customer appreciation and accommodation.  Obviously, I am not your clientele.  You are looking for high turning tables.  Good thing there are high numbers of quality restaurants serving breakfast in the valley.  So sad to see a small business owner turning his business into a money train instead of a welcoming restaurant for all likes.  CRAZY!  Note to the owner after his response.  My meeting wasn't until 8 am.  I was there a few minutes before that and got sat by your staff when I walked in.  I left my house at 7:20 - good try!  This review was written at 10:03 (after chatting with my colleague for 10 minutes in your parking lot).  So you do not only kick out your customers but you are dishonestly arguing and accosting them after YOU made a bad call.  I accept your apology that you didn't offer.  Please take my advise and acknowledge that customer service is NOT your strong suit.  If your staff wanted us out after we finished eating at 9:15, it would have been far more tactful as a business owner to ask her to approach us and suggest there was a need for our table and request when we would be finished.  We would have IMMEDIATELY apologized and left.  Your braizen and aggressive approach was not only rude, but tactless.    Ultimately, THANK YOU so much.  I am so happy to know that this is your character now than to continue to patron your business.  You did me a favor!  Good luck!",

For a second I thought I may be beachfront in San Diego instead of the Phoenix valley.  Can't wait for my next visit.",

Chef John is a fun loving guy and has recently remodeled the place with a surfer look. It may seem that eggs bacon and hash browns are just eggs bacon and hash browns but not here! The food is cooked perfectly, the wait staff are friendly and prompt, the place is always packed but don't let that stop you. Chef John has added crepes to the menu and I couldn't resist. And while a savory crepe would be my normal choice the Vanilla Creme with Chocolate Drizzle is what I got. It was luscious, I think whole wheat flour in the crepes, rich and filling, not overly sweet, just the correct flavors of vanilla and chocolate",

But then again, their eggs are delicious, too. I'm especially fond of the linguica scramble.  Bakery items are top notch. Scones are delicious, and although I don't personally care for cinnamon rolls, every time someone I go with gets one I regret my decision to not join in.  4 stars instead of 5 for two reason:   (1) cash only. I understand that the owner may have a philosophical objection, but it is 2019 - come on.  (2) it has gotten so insanely busy that the only way to get in is to come at 6 AM.",

Ironically, we ordered a different omelette but the one someone (not our waitress) brought out was so good we ate it and didn't notice that it was different until we were finished. That doesn't happen every day!  Our waitress noticed and agreed we had ordered something with green chile. We insisted that they not make something out of the incident.   I ordered the chicken fried chicken and gravy with two eggs and French toast. Very good!  They say it is their best selling breakfast. I believe it.    Overall, I liked everything about it.

The HR came slopped on a plate that was way too small and was just a huge sloppy mess that lacked flavor and presentation. The French toast is deep fried evidently, and tasted like funnel cakes from the end of the day at the fair. Not sure if it's always like this, but I won't be going back to find out.

The only downside is that this place is cash only which is pretty challenging to remember before entering. They do have an ATM so I guess that helps if you carry around a debit card everywhere, we do not. There are pancakes are not my favorite. It seems like they put maybe lemon in their pancakes which is just not what I like in mine. I'm not sure if there's a way to ask for them to not come with lemon but last time I checked and that's all they had. I would definitely recommend them serving just regular ole pancakes. It has a pretty surfer vibe in their which is fun.",

I've had meals that were excellent, such as the spam and eggs, and I've had some that were not so good, such as the fried bologna sandwich (my father-in-law also did not like it) and the spinach salad.  To clarify, there was nothing technically wrong with those entree's preparations, they just didn't taste good to me.     The coffee is always thin on flavor, but it is hot, fresh, readily offered, and kept coming.  The orange juice is fresh, but never cold enough to be refreshing.  Overall, there's nothing keeping me from Original Breakfast House, but there's also nothing compelling about it.  I've gone enough times to avoid the pitfalls (my better half loves this place), but there are pitfalls nevertheless. OBH is good enough to encourage you to go and make up your own mind.  There's a decent chance you'll love it.",

The chicken fried steak batter was really good and non-greasy.  The food descriptions aren't new and you've probably seen the exact same offerings at other places but it is done BETTER here.

    "text": "This breakfast/brunch joint is the hidden gem you hope to find when you want to escape from the generic boring IHOP'S and Dennys' of the world. I love restaurants that get creative with their menus! This place gives you plenty of options and offers a unique variety that will leave you so indecisive, you have to come back again to try something else! They also have daily specials that aren't on the regular menu and they are just as tempting when you aren't sure what you're in the mood for.  I tried the fried bologna sandwich because it is something I've never had in my life. It was good, the sandwich was big, the grilled onions give it extra flavor and there's plenty of meat.  I don't know if I'd order it again, only because I'm not used to eating bologna when it's hot and it's not something I'd eat often, but there were plenty of other things I want to try in the future.  I chose potato salad to go with my sandwich,  the tricky thing about potato salad is if you're making it while the potatoes are still hot,  you're going to get a funky taste once you add the dressing to it. It was okay,  but it was even better when I added California 3 pepper hot sauce to it. That hot sauce is magical! I'm going to buy a bottle or 2 when I go back. I wish I could buy a case, I have a feeling they will make an excellent sauce for hot wings!  They sell the bottles up in the front and there are 3 different kinds to choose from. They also have baked goods, I didn't try them yet,  but they looked good- nice and big in size. Prices are fair and comparable to other breakfast places, but I can tell you the flavor and quality rises waaay above the generic \"blah\" of soggy undercooked hash browns from the likes of Denny's. The waitress and manager were friendly and welcoming.  ***Try this place if you aren't boring, enjoy adventures and aren't one to settle for mediocrity!",

God bless America and I'm sure glad I did !  Like any good brunch spot worth it's weight in sodium, there was a wait but a very pleasant one at that.  They have lawn chairs out front where you can post up and soak up some rays before entering this breakfast wonderland.    Entering this palace of culinary cunnilingus I immediately felt like royalty as a pleasant servant set a king size jug of coffee in front of me before delivering some fresh squeezed OJ to my lady friend and I.  Great start to an epic feast...  With our servers advice I settled on the French toast special--a regal orgy of flash fried bread, cinnamon, strawberries and fresh whipped cream fit fit for the gods themselves.  Add a couple strips of perfectly fried pig primed bacon and this meal will leave any mortal breathless, blurry of vision and ready for a cigarette.

We had to wait about 7 or 8 minutes before anyone came over to the table to take our drink order, so by that time, we had decided what we wanted to eat, and just ordered all at once.   I got the Farmer's Market omelet, which came with hash browns and toast. I also got the freshly squeezed orange juice, which came with one free refill - this was probably the best part.   The food came pretty quickly, and it wasn't that good, the cheese wasn't melted enough, all of the veggies kept falling out of the omelet. Also the glasses and silverware looked like they still had food on them. A lot of the servers looked like they have not taken a shower in days and the overall vibe of the place was more like a diner that you go to at 3 am than a family restaurant.   I will not be returning, I think this place was really overrated.",

Don't come here for a gourmet breakfast, but it is good. We waited for 40 minutes for a seat, so I assumed the food was going to be amazing. I got the chicken fried steak and it was pretty good, but required hot sauce for some needed flavor. It seemed like it was freshly made not a pre made frozen brick. I think I will try it again and get something new, maybe I'll like it even more.",

We ended up paying mostly in change which was inconvenient and slightly embarrassing.  Luckily we had enough cash to tip the waitress in bills rather than a bunch of change, but I do not want to have to deal with that again.",

I'm generally an eggs gal but my server, Divina (who is by the way one of the very best at her job) recommended the corn beef hash describing it as the \"best\". Having taken such recomendations in the past with many home runs and a few strikes and knowing that each persons 'best' can vary I decided to go ahead with Divina's suggestion and I'm glad that I did.  And the best it was... out came a plate piled with potatos, green peppers and of course, the star....Real Corned Beef .. lots. ..sliced into chunks.. and yes.. the best.... yummy!! Now I'm hooked... but folks be patient and diligent as this is not on there regular menu.. only served as a special because it takes so much time to prepare the best from scratch!!",

Wow what a meal. The omelet and hash browns were great. I had to have half of it. Mine was also good but the omelet won the contest.  Very friendly and speed service.  Will be back soon. Will be trying the Friday fish fry soon.  Glad to have this diamond in my backyard.",

I'm currently doing whole30 so was excited about the farm fresh commitment advertised on their website.   The omelettes we had were good and the green chili was exceptional.  The portions were large,  and you could get egg whites.   However, it looked like the deep fried French toast and pancakes were the better option.   Our very friendly, energetic waitress made sure to flaunt our neighbor's order past us.   It is a little crowded and loud,  but otherwise a good atmosphere. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt, and will definitely be back on my cheat day.",

The gravy is the good kind with big chunks or sausage in it. The home fries are a must have. Only two knocks on this place is that I'm not a huge fan of their pancakes as they have a lemon flavor to them that some people like but it's not for me. Also, their prices are a bit high for breakfast food. After tax and tip I paid $17 for my food. If you haven't been to this spot yet I highly suggest checking it out. I haven't been there yet for lunch but will soon!",

    "text": "In my continuing pursuit of amazing breakfasts, I came across Original Breakfast House with it's amazing Yelp reviews.  There was no way I could skip this place.  When I pulled up I was curious as the area did not seem very new or nice, however, there was a line out the door.  Approximately 20 people were standing outside waiting for a table.  We were told the wait would be about 20 minutes so we decided to stick with it and see what would happen.    When we were seated there was already a carafe of water at the table.  Awesome!   Original Breakfast House makes their own fresh squeezed orange juice which seemed like a must try.  It tasted like I was literally licking an orange.  I've never had orange juice that fresh before.  Interestingly, it came with a refill as well.  Bonus!  I have been eating healthy lately so I opted for the egg white scramble (egg whites with mushrooms, onions, avocado, pico).  I didn't expect much...I mean it's egg whites and veggies.  This is the best egg white scramble I've ever had.  I don't think egg whites are supposed to be this good.  I was literally blown away.    Our service was excellent too.  I asked for hot sauce and the server brought 5 kinds for me to choose from.  She was so friendly and even brought another carafe when our water ran empty.    This was a wonderful breakfast spot and I would say it is definitely worth a visit if you are in the area or close by.",

Today we were pleased to find that at the bar counter-top there were 2 open seats (which is first come first serve), the seats were not next to one an other but we were able to arrange them together. Nick, the owners son, caused a scene and moved us remotely to a corner. As we tried to apologize and help him move us--he got in my husband face and and tried to pick a fight. This was humiliating and shocking.   We stayed...giving Nick and John (the owners) the benefit of the doubt that it was some kind of misunderstanding. As we left, we asked to speak to the the father (John) to let him know that the way Nick spoke to us was not right and disrespectful. In turn Nick came out and started a scene all over again, this time disrespectfully speaking to both my husband & I, even saying he did not need our business. We were baffled and left absolutely disappointed.   We have always supported & raved about OBH...Their food, their kind staff, and unique dinning experience has always been fantastic. This kind of humiliation and disrespect has driven us to not only ever want to go back... But let other people know... To not move chairs because apparently it's a big NO NO at this place and you might leave in shock!! Unfortunately if Nick ends up running this place, he will run it to the ground. Professionalism, customer service, and plain human kindness are key to running a successful business my fiend! None of which you possess.",

    "text": "We were excited to try this place out after seeing all the 5 star reviews. I will give them tons of credit for creativity when putting together their menu. Customer service is good. We like the fact that they use organic and local products.   On to our experience. The other person in my party was taking a while to decide what he was going to have, so I ordered a lemon scone (which happens to be one of my favorite things). The server brought it to me and had heated it up pretty hot. I had never had a hot scone before. I didn't like it, she offered to bring me another (not heated), I accepted. But I still didn't like it. It seemed a bit stale and the taste wasn't great. I gave it away. Next, I ordered the chicken fried chicken. Comes with a piece of french toast and 2 eggs. The chicken was good and had a wonderful gravy, but they don't give you very much of it. I know the french toast gets lots of rave reviews, but we didn't particularly care for it. The deep frying process must make it that strange texture, kind of like chewing on a dish sponge. The other party ordered a Monte Cristo sandwich which comes with fruit, and then he added an order of homefries. We would not order the homefries again for the very small portion that is given. Neither of us liked his sandwich, so they brought him The Bomber burger (comes with fries) instead, it was very tasty. Fries aren't anything special - typical diner fries. We may go again in the future to give the omelettes a try. Total bill for 2 people (2 entrees, side of homefries, scone, 1 coffee) $35 plus tip.",

    "text": "One word: Phenomenal!  When a place is voted number 1 breakfast in Phoenix by AZCentral, and have amazing reviews on Yelp, you have to check it out.  When you first get to the Original Breakfast House usually there is always a wait which is good because you know the restaurant is popping out some amazing dishes.  The staff is super friendly and treat you like family.  The one thing I noticed is that the Owner John who is one of the nicest people you will meet will greet, walk around talk to the customers, and he will help the waitresses with serving food, and bus tables.  You do not see that very often from owners of restaurants that put that much care into a restaurant.  When I see that you know the food will be amazing because they put the \"Love into it\".  Also, this restaurant does not take credit cards which could be discouraging, but on the Original Breakfast House website they give an explanation on why they do not so they can pay the staff a better wage.  Also they have ATM's inside the restaurant with no fees.  The waitress was super attentive, helpful, sweet, and treated you like family.    This amazing experience happened all before the food even came out!  Now, being a bodybuilder foodie I had to try everything that I could on the menu and believe me when I say this you can pick anything off the menu and you cannot go wrong.  Everything was delicious.  Here is what we tried and what I recommend:  Shrimp and Grits - Topped with a poached egg and served with a biscuit.  The shrimp and grits was out of bounds good.  You get the freshness of the shrimp with the hint of the peppers and onions, then you get hit with the hot sauce that they put on the dish which compliments well with the cheddar creamy grits and the warm pouched egg yolk.  The hot sauce was just the right amount of kick.  This is a very savory entree.  Lemon Curd and Blueberry Pancakes - When you get anything lemon sometimes you do not get enough lemon flavor with dishes, that is not the case here.  The pancakes were light, airy, and fluffy.  The lemon curd syrup has a big lemon flavor (does not overpower the pancake) which soaks into the pancake nicely, and then you get hit with the blueberry sweetness on the back end.  No need for syrup here!  Asparagus, Bacon, Goat Cheese Scramble - First off the hash browns that come with this entree is hearty.  The hash browns are cooked to perfection where you get the nice crunchy crust on the top.  The omelet itself was amazing.  With every bite you are getting the saltiness of the bacon (Meat Candy) and the taste of asparagus.  What makes the omelet though is the goat cheese.  You have chunks of goat cheese in the omelet which adds the creaminess taste and texture to every bite.    Green Pork Chili Benedict -  I was very surprised with this dish.  The texture and flavor was insane crazy!  It is two tamale cakes topped with pork green chili, poached eggs, hollandaise sauce, served on a corn husk.  There is so many layers of flavor with this it was like a party in your mouth.  First you get the taste of the fat warm egg yolk that is mixed with the hollandaise sauce, the tender, juicy pork, then you get a little kick from the green chili, and the finish of the tamale cakes.    Garden Hash and Eggs - If you are a vegetarian this is the entree for you.  You have \"Hash Potatoes\" with green and red peppers, zucchini, asparagus, spinach, mushrooms, onions, cheddar cheese, topped with two eggs and toast.  This meal is very hearty and you will not leave hungry after eating this entree.  The potatoes are cooked to perfection where you get the crunchy outside and the light fluffy potato in the middle.  What makes this entree is the runny egg and cheddar cheese which mixes and complements well with all the cooked/sauteed veggies.    Brioche Cinnamon Roll - Nothing really much to say beside this was \"Damn Good!\".  These are freshly made everyday with brioche bread and covered with frosting.  Every inch of this cinnamon roll is covered with frosting.  Oh and by the way, they heat up the roll before they serve it to you.    Pop Tart - Nothing beats a homemade made fresh everyday Pop Tart!  this pop tart had all natural fruit filling.  Everything you would want a Pop Tart to be.  No need to go to the store and get a box just get one at Original Breakfast House.  Banana Pecan French Toast - One of the best french toasts I have ever had!  You get two massive sourdough slices that are fried to perfection.  They call this San Francisco style because of the Sourdough bread they use.  This french toast is a mouth feel explosion.    Favorite Dish Chicken Fried Chicken - Holy Crap this is the best entree they have!  You get the tender, juiciness of the white meat with the crunch of the fried to perfection outside, then they cover the fried chicken with this nice thick country gravy.  The Entree to get when you come in!  BrandonFitFoodie",

We finally dined there today (Tuesday late morning) and boy, are we glad we did!   The place was busy, but there were two open tables so we were seated right away. Our server was genuine, friendly, and efficient. We had the fresh squeezed OJ (best I have ever had) and split the brioche cinnamon bun. It was warm, gooey, & sensational...no denying that they make these from scratch every day! We had the chicken fried chicken and WOW! Juicy, tender, flavorful...my husband was in love! Our over easy eggs were cooked perfectly and the crispy hash was awesome. AMAZING food and excellent service.   The cash only policy didn't bother us. I rather a small business pay their staff well and provide a positive environment than ya guests having the \"convenience\" of paying with a credit card. Plus, there is an ATM inside the entrance.   No doubt we will be back and next month will be bringing our family from out of town with us!",

    "text": "The Original Breakfast House has two very important things going for it: #1- The Service. #2-The Food. First, the service. Everyone who works there seems to genuinely care. My server was Kelsie(?)and she was such a great server! Caring, attentive , and conscientious. She even offered to make me a coffee to go after my breakfast, and invited me to take my time and stay as long as I liked after I had finished eating.  Second, the food. I have really been trying hard not to eat carbs, going so far as to maintain a perfect Keto diet for 3 months until I crashed and burned, but I digress. Lately I have been craving some good pancakes, and the Original Breakfast House has great pancakes! I was reading through the menu having a difficult time deciding. The description of the pancakes made with a hint of lemon zest got me hook, line, and sinker. Better yet, they offer a signature fresh blueberry and lemon curd pancake dish. I was in like Flynn! I made a great choice too! They were fluffy and light with the perfect combination of sweet (the blueberries) and tart (the lemon curd). They didn't need the syrup that comes on the side. The savory dishes looked great too...I will definitely return to try other dishes.  A couple of things that may deter you (although they shouldn't ). The restaurant is cash only, although they do have a free ATM on premise. The location is a tiny bit sketchy located just south  of Greenway on 32nd St in Phoenix in the parking lot of a very run down strip mall of sorts. The restaurant itself is older with a bit of kitsch. Lots of surfboards covering the walls. All in all, homey and comfortable. The kind of place my mom and stepdad would have loved. The kind of place you will probably love too.",

A family member at our table had the Big Gooey Scramble Mess plate and it was so much!  The California Benedict was very good! Only downside was they get you on their beverage pricing... 3.85 for an approx 12 oz. (?) cup of orange juice And I don't think my niece even had a refill .  We would come back again since they had great food, and good portions.  Didn't get to try the cinnamon roll or any other pastries that looked so good in the glass display up front!",

    "text": "Original Breakfast House didn't disappoint. We were there on Friday around lunch time and the place was packed. We were able to get a table quickly and the service was excellent. The food came out quickly and our waitress checked on us often.   The eggs Benedict special was delicious. It was slightly on the salty side but the sauce, runny yolk and English muffin were at perfect harmony.  The small stack pancakes were huuge! Enough to share and have leftovers.   Their freshly squeezed OJ was also delicious. It was slightly sour from the oranges, just how it should be. It came with one free refill so we took the second serving home. Enjoy!   Btw, they only accept cash but they have cash machine inside the restaurant.",

    "text": "This place is soooooooooo overrated.   Let's start with the french toast which is soaked in dirty grease used to fry chicken so it taste like bad, old grease with a chicken smell to it. I wanted to throw up, but my wife was a trooper and managed to hold it down.  My son got the pop tart which was better than expected but he gave up on it about half way through.   I played it safe and made a last minute change to the blueberry short stack and was so glad that I did. It was good and got the job done.  The bacon was good as you'd expect from a place like this.  I was annoyed by the menu making excuses about their cash only policy and pointing out how they pay $50k in fees. Since credit cards charge 3%, that suggests they are raking in over $1.6 million a year serving breakfast so they don't have any excuse for paying the 3% to accept credit cards like the rest of the modern world. It's 100% greed on their part, so spare me the sob story.   It wasn't worth the wait and definitely not worth of its great Yelp rating so this was one where Yelp was totally wrong.   Oh, and did I mention it is in a bad part of town?  I definitely won't be back to plunk down $50 cash for breakfast for a modest two kids and two adults with terrible coffee and a long wait to get in.",

The place is nothing special on the exterior but it is what is on the inside that matters!  Fun atmosphere (Hawaii style) with great staff and a retired ex-California charismatic owner who stops by the tables to check on you.  The pancakes....oh the pancakes.  This place found a way to make them fluffy without cake flour.  Using some citric acid from lemons to breakdown the gluten!  This also gave them an incredible flavor that worked well with syrup and cinnamon.  My son got the cinnamon roll pancakes and I got the chocolate chip raspberry pancakes.  These 'cakes did not last long.  Owen and I devoured them as if they were a last meal and it was worth it.  Sorry to Wildberry Cafe but you will have to settle for #2.

Don't expect a Bloody Mary or a mimosa for a Sunday brunch. Teetotalers rejoice.   No patio dining, can't take advantage of our amazing weather if you're dining here.  As others have said, they are cash only. Their sign states that this is to help pay the staff, but based on how slow our service was, I doubt the savings from that are actually going to the staff, they just didn't seem to care. There are plenty of services out there that can help small businesses accept cards for very low fees, but the owner seems unwilling to get with the times, and posts a snarky sign instead.",

    "text": "We came here on a Friday morning really expecting a spectacular breakfast based on the reviews. We were somewhat disappointed. This is a diner type place which we were aware of but too unhealthy for our liking. My friend got an omelette with hash browns and English muffin. I got the egg white spinach with potatoes and multi grain bread. My husbands breakfast was fine but over buttered which was similar to my dish. All the right ingredients were there but the dish was just too buttery to Bare. My favorite part was the multi grain bread which had no butter and was toasted perfectly. There was strawberry jam to go with it but that was just ok. The service was good though and very friendly. Just remember to bring cash  Bottom line...if you are looking for a diner meets Paula deen breakfast then this is the place. If you are looking for a good but somewhat healthy breakfast then try somewhere else.   Pros Friendly service  Wide range of breakfast options  Good quality food   Cons  Too buttery  Strawberry jam is too sugary  You must pay cash here  This restaurant isn't in the great part of town",

We had raspberry pancakes, a basic bacon and eggs dish, a sausage, potato and egg scrambler, and their special, the San Francisco Scrambler.  All were very tasty and big portions.  Their toast was great and comes with a delicious strawberry jam.  I would definitely  recommend the San Fran scrambler, but sub the ground beef for chorizo...really great dish!",

The place was very busy when we got there. We waited almost 20 minutes and was told that it was a 30 minute wait.  As we waited, we were informed by the other customers that they tend to be busy all the time but we won't be disappointed. And WOW! The wait was worth it. They were right! I love a good breakfast place. I love the customer service - they were fantastic. Very friendly and attentive.  The food was beyond what I expected! I ordered their \"fresh squeezed\" orange juice which was good. I love that you get 1 FREE refill for the Fresh OJ. And it was not to pulpy...just the right amount! My girls ordered chocolate and vanilla milkshake and both shakes were creamy & yummy. My girls definitely enjoyed it. Both of my girls ordered the kids pancake w/ bacon. It came w/ 4 dollar size pancakes and a bacon. My oldest ate 3 of the 4 of the pancakes. She loved that they were fluffy and delicious. My bf ordered their eggs and pancakes w/ home-style fried potatoes - he said it was delicious and ate every thing on the plate! I had a taste of the home-style fried potatoes, it was seasoned well and loved that it was cut smaller. The twins had cinnamon rolls with their large chocolate milk- the cinnamon roll looked gooey and yummy! I shared the famous chicken fried chicken w/ my bf's sister. She warned me that it was big so I prepared myself for it. It was delicious - the chicken was seasoned & cooked right and I love the French toast that came with it! We ordered cinnamon rolls to go because they looked so yummy and I was too stuffed to keep eating. I definitely over indulge myself! I love this place! Chandler/Tempe definitely needs a Breakfast house like this!",

Mushrooms were also included but we requested them to be removed (order was correct).  Fix the raw onions and I'll change to five stars!  :)  Fresh squeezed oj was yummy but take note that is pulpy.   Super friendly service. speedy order delivery, fair prices.

Anyway the food is always good here and I'm always happy to get the fresh squeezed orange juice but the glass for the juice had a chip in it and the water glass on the table had stuff in it. I understand it was a busy day but when the hostess sat me she didn't bring me any water she just ordered the busser to do it. My server was nice but I hardly saw her someone else came to give me my food and then my server came back asked how it was and gave me my check and that was the last time I saw her. I'm just really disappointed about the service here, it's not hard to simply ask someone to do something instead of raising your voice or to be demanding. It's just really unprofessional. These stars are basically for the food definitely not the service",

I stayed away because they have these childish life size square boxes with letters on them-- like the staking blocks that children play with. First impression gave me that this was not a place I wanted to eat at- and I have kids. I finally went because a friend told me about it. the food is amazing!!! the breakfast is amazing. I have yet to try anything else- banana French toast special is the best in the city. Nothing childish about this place- staff is amazing- homemade treats Cinnabon rolls and frosting - warm people- smiles all around.The food also speaks for itself. No childish blocks or decor on the inside. not clear why they have these displayed on the front lawn gives an impression you are attending a child play location. So in other words don't do what I did and judge it by the kiddo display boxes. my only advice would be to get rid of these boxes. No use- no relation to the theme of the restaurant - I don't understand why they are there to represent your wonderful restaurant.",

Every bite seemed to taste better, and the dish came with three biscuits instead of the standard two. I also ordered two eggs over-easy and they were cooked exactly right, which doesn't happen often even in restaurants that focus on breakfast items. The orange juice is fresh-squeezed and while expensive at $4, you can get as many refills as you want for free. The regular menu is pretty typical for a local breakfast joint, with a slight emphasis on Tex-Mex themed choices.   The service was super fast (I ate at about 10:30 a.m. on a Friday) but I did not feel rushed. The waitress left a coffee carafe without asking, which is really a nice touch.  I definitely plan to make the Original Breakfast House a regular habit from now on.",

We never made it here, and have never seen the need to find it since discovering OBH.  The food is so delicious. It's made with care and the best of the best in terms of ingredients. You can taste the difference! I love breakfast food and whether I am ordering eggs, bacon and toast or going for pancakes, this is simply the best food I've found anywhere. The bread is sliced thick and from a bakery. The jam is like homemade. The bacon is thick cut and peppered. The pancakes are delicately flavored with lemon and ever so light and fluffy. The banana pecan pancakes are just delicious. I like to top my meal off with the fresh brewed iced tea.  It just doesn't get better than this and the prices are reasonable to boot! Once you're done here, you can head down the street to \"A Second Look\" for some fantastic consignment shopping.",

The staff is very friendly and although this place can get crowded, the wait time has never been too long and they do a great job getting people served quickly.

The tables already have a carafe of water with glasses and coffee cups waiting.  Our waitresses came over quickly and took our order.  Food was delivered surprisingly quickly considering the restaurant was packed.  My Popeye omelet was perfect and the accompanying pancakes had a wonderful lemony flavor to them. The entire staff of waitresses/waiters, busy boys functioned as a well oiled machine.  Even the owner was visiting customers tables.  They do get busy so be prepared to wait during prime times.",

    "text": "We came on a Monday about 11am. The parking lot was full as was the restaurant. It was pretty noisy inside but we didnt mind. We were immediately greeted and given a carafe of water. I had the China Mist tea. I ordered sausage and eggs for about $10. The eggs were great, sausage had a piece of fuzz or hair on it , home fries were very flavorful but could have been cooked a bit longer. I ordered sourdough toast and it was AMAZING. It comes with a butter pat, which they left out long enough to allow it to be spreadable. I dislike it when restaurants let their butter sit in the fridge so it chips and doesn't spread. My husband had biscuits and gravy. I always compare gravy to the gravy we make at the restaurant I work at. It was ok. It wasn't as good as Chef Michael's from AJ's Fine Foods in Glendale (best gravy ever!!!). All in all we will return and bring our kids because I think they will enjoy all the sweets they offer. Our serve Seta was an awesome server!!! Very friendly, she deserves five stars!",

That's when i found out about him owning the whole plaza and thrift store (i'm a freak about thrift stores). I was interested in the gf banana pancakes and that is what i had, it was  delicious, all the flavor was there but they were more like a crepe because how thin they were, no complaint regarding that, just mentioning it. Great service, really good coffee with non-dairy flavored creamer (a bonus). Freshly squeezed orange juice.  Definitely will be back!",

My huevos rancheros were delicious and the green sauce that came on them was very tasty and slightly spicy. I loved it and would definitely order it again. Sorry no pics, it didn't last long on the plate.  We also had the Cajun andouille scramble that they had for the daily special and my boyfriend absolutely loved it. He's actually Cajun, so I think that gives it some validation that it was legitimate Cajun goodness.  Never heard of this place before, but close enough to home that we will come again.   The service was the best I've had in a long time. They had great attention to detail on the orders! Everyone was very helpful and such a positive friendly environment.",

    "text": "Went Monday morning at 6:30am for Breakfast after looking for someplace other than IHOP on Yelp; was absolutely thrilled with everything we got.  OBH has the comfortable feel of a \"classic american diner\" (very clean and bright, not dingy and old) but when you start eating the food, you realize the owner and chef are going above and beyond the \"typical american diner\" food.  Just for starters; the orange juice is fresh squeezed... as in, \"Oh look over there, you can see them squeezing the juice I am about to drink from a crate of oranges\". For citrus snobs (like myself) you're next question is probably: \"Yea but how ripe were the oranges?\" because you know just because you juice an orange by hand doesn't guarantee good juice. Don't worry, the juice was fantastic. Rich, a little tiny bit pulpy and with a deep orange flavor not  washed out/unripened or sour taste.   Did I mention you get 1 free refill on the juice to boot? Didn't expect that at all... we go to Old Town a lot for breakfast where a thin glass of juice will set you back $5; not only is OBH fresh-squeezing this stuff but also giving you an awesome amount of it.  (If you've never squeezed your own oranges you might not appreciate how much work it is to get a large volume of juice out of oranges; it can take a bag full just to get a small pitcher's worth).  Next was the coffee.  Kelly (our peach of a waitress) brought the pot over to leave on our table and said \"Oh our coffee is really good\" -- I didn't think much of it as I've roasted my own beans, been through a few cappuccino machines (Jura and Rancilio) and am generally a coffee snob.   Given that, I was totally surprised when sure enough, the coffee WAS excellent... it is a very smooth blend, almost no acidity or bite and just had a very easy rich flavor. I threw some cream and sugar in it and it was absolutely wonderful.  So now we get to the food, my wife and I ordered:  * (Me) 5 egg-white scramble w/ home fries and white toast * (Wife) French toast special w/ sausage  The serving sizes are generous; I would put it on par with something like Cracker Barrel where your meal shows up and you go \"Oh crap, that is a lot of food\"; you absolutely feel like you are being taken care of.  The food was FANTASTIC.  The owner and the chef are doing what I would describe as \"Classic American Breakfast++\" -- meaning all the classics and originals you would recognize, but done with extra TLC that makes the restaurant that much more memorable and delicious.  For example, the bread you get with your meal isn't crap bread from the super market; it is artisan bread from a local bakery that they chop into thick, soft, toasted slices that melt butter perfectly.  The jam that comes with your toast isn't Smuckers in little packets; it is a custom jam from a small company out of Tucson, AZ (like a fruit compote)  The french toast is DEEP FRIED... do you realize how tasty this is? It's like a funnel cake, cinnamon role and big piece of artisan bread all had a baby and then it was deep fried with an egg wash and covered in butter and syrup... it's amazing.  These little touches of excellence that are all over the menu and make all the difference.  For a brand new place that just opened up (~3 months ago) OBH seems to be doing everything right and I doubt it will be much longer until this is that breakfast place you swing by on a Sat or Sun morning and there is a 30min wait. We already saw a handful of regulars that were known by name come strolling in.  We'll likely go back soon to give lunch a try, but as far as breakfast is concerned we were thrilled.",

The fact that California Pepper Sauce is on the table instead of the usual suspects is icing on the cake for me. Eggs taste great and I assume are organic.  I've enjoyed (from several visits): Poached eggs and omelets: eggs respectfully cooked and to my liking. Pancakes: great batter recipe and NOT over beaten.  Light and fluffy. French Toast:  they deep fry - and I have to say that they are good. Toast:  Sourdough toast was thick and excellent.  Not from grocery or Costco. Service was great and staff was friendly. A Few things maybe they could consider for rock star status: 1. Plating and presentation can be better.   2. offer a natural and/or organic syrup.  Having the High Fructose Corn Syrup alone NOT a great thing. 3.  offer a ketchup that isn't full of High Fructose Corn Syrup and/or Corn oil.  Lots of brands out there that are a better choice. 4.  need more fruits and veggies.",

The El Paso Omelette, Juan's Tacos, The Green Chili Cheeseburger, The Home Fries, The Mediterranean Rice Bowl are all absolutely spectacular!:)",

Nothing fancy from the outside or inside but had people waiting to be seated so I thought this must be real good. First of all, this was the most courteous and prompt service I've gotten in a long time! Had the chicken fried chicken platter with eggs and french toast. FRESHLY squeezed orange juice plus 1 free refill. Everything tasted superb and super fresh. The yolk in my eggs were orange as opposed to yellow as they use eggs from free range chickens and other organic ingredients in their meals. The chicken was juicy and nicely seasoned. In fact, the breading was out of this world tasty and unique. Everything tasted home made and I rarely give 5 Star reviews on restaurants but this place really deserves it for everything I just mentioned plus the very low prices they offer. What a rare gem and I will go out of my way to eat here again!",

The food sat good throughout the day with me and i didnt have that yucky breakfast food coma that i mostly get from other places. The food here was so rich and different, i almost crave it again and i just had it a few hours ago. ALSO SIDE NOTE: THEY HAVE GLUTEN FREE PANCAKES. So for you gluten free people, they do cater to you as well! Please give it a try!!",

We both had omelettes the first time (the El Paso for me and spinach mushroom for her). The chorizo in the El Paso wasn't too greasy and the guac (makes everything better) and sour cream balanced the spicy chorizo. This time we both had French toast (she had the banana pecan and I had the regular). What can I say about the French toast except WOW! The batter has orange zest, cinnamon, and vanilla then they deep fry it too add just a little decadence. Don't forget to have the fresh squeezed O.J. with free refills. I have found my favorite French toast spot and possibly my favorite breakfast spot.",

This place is amazing!!  The decor is a retro modern, I loved it.  It is a cute place with great people and servers.  Very reasonably priced with big portions. Now let me tell you about the food:  First of all the cinnamon roll is to die for.  One of the best I have ever had!!  We also shared a cranberry orange scone, also very good.  Their sweets are all made in house and you can tell 100%.  They are a must when here!!  Now the food, also very very good!!  I had the pancake breakfast...it was 2 pancakes, eggs, and sausage or bacon for about $8.  This was very good.  The pancakes for fluffy and delicious.  My BFF had the french toast breakfast.  This was the same as the pancake but with 2 slices of french toast.  Their french toast is  awesome!!  It was like something you would find at a state fair.  It was like funnel cake french toast.  I would recommend this 100%.  My husband had the Hog Heaven omelet.  Oh my this was also delicious!!  There was so much meat and cheese in this thing it was unreal.  Also the potatoes were good!    Okay, one more thing....the OJ!!  Fresh squeezed (you can see them do it).  You get a glass for $2.75 - with a refill!!!  It was a glass of fresh, pulpy deliciousness!!  Overall I would recommend this place to anyone, we will come back for sure!!",

He got the pork chop and eggs special. Pork chops were not seasoned at all and over cooked.  The toast seemed as if it was toasted early and left out sitting, which is understandable during busy times as they get used quickly, but it was slow. I ordered chicken fried chicken. The chicken was forgettable, the gravy was not cooked out so you could taste the starch, french toast tasted like a bland funnel cake.   Service was awful as well. I asked her for the cinnamon roll to be served while we wait for our meals. She asked if we wanted it heated and we said yes. It NEVER arrived. She realized she forgot a steak knife and I asked for ketchup. She never came back with it until I had to ask for the ketchup to help me finish the meal. She dropped off the check without even asking if we needed anything else.  The only good thing was the coffee. No return business from us.",

I found this lovely gem while doing a search for breakfast on yelp. The pictures of the food is what brought us here. Wow. What a great find.  We came early for breakfast (before 8:30) on the Memorial weekend and good thing too because the seats outside were completely full of people waiting to get in when we left. It was our first time so we went balls out. I was quickly lured in by the french toast combo, but then the Chicken Fried Chicken caught my eye. My husband ordered the same thing. And to my luck, my daughter ordered the french toast combo so I got to taste her yummy thick cut bacon. My two boys had the pancakes with bacon. I also ordered a side of biscuits and gravy. Heck, why not!?  I don't think we talked much during the meal. It was mostly, \"Ummmm.... This is so good!\" Or, \"Here, try this, it's really good!\" My daughter's hot cocoa was a thing of beauty. It had whipped cream, chocolate syrup, and sprinkles! Too cute.   We had great service from beginning to end. We asked the manager for syrup to go since we were staying in a hotel. He went a step further and offered us utensils. Yeah, kinda forgot about that part, but he had us covered. The prices were reasonable for our meals averaging about $12 a plate for a big breakfast.   This place is bookmarked and will be on our to do list every year we go back to AZ. Thanks a bunch! You were awesome!",

Our waiter was awesome and very knowledgeable about the menu and made some great recommendations.  Everything is scratch made and fresh.  There is so much to choose from, it is hard to decide - but you can't go wrong.  They are very flexible with substitutions and add ons - so you can get exactly what you want.  My only complaint was with the biscuits in my biscuits and gravy.  They are dry and crumbly, the gravy was fantastic though, I would order it as a side next time.   All the egg dishes were delicious and the bacon is cooked perfectly and full of smoky flavor.  The hash browns are perfectly browned.  The pancakes have a hint of lemon flavor added to the batter, very light & fluffy.  The big winner was the French Toast !!!!!  BEST WE EVER HAD!!!! It is amazing.  They dip it in the pancake batter and deep fry it, paired with whipped creamy butter and incredible maple syrup- it was one of the best tasting things we had ever had.",

With superior food and great service, the OBH, as it is called, has a great reputation extending far from my neighborhood around 32 St and Thunderbird Rd. I like the linguica and egg scramble. Linguica is a Portuguese sausage.  If you go on the weekend, you better get there early or you'll have a lengthy wait. A way to get around the wait is to accept seating at the counter.  Oh! Remember to bring cash; they don't accept credit or debit cards.",

I was feeling something light but filling & this made the cut!   OATMEAL: My friend got this cos she was also craving something light & the portion size of the oatmeal was more than enough! It came with a side of almonds, brown sugar, and milk.   CUSTOMER SERVICE: They were friendly, quick, & accommodating! Even though this wasn't a big deal, my friends were sharing a burger for breakfast and the workers were thoughtful enough to cut the burger in half, split the hash browns, and put their shared breakfast onto two separate plates. Not a huge gesture but really thoughtful, nonetheless.   P.S: Their OJ comes in a little cup but there's one free refill.",

Fast and extremely friendly and informative service, low prices, fresh local ingredients.  If this place was in Arcadia there would be hour long waits. Fresh squeezed navel orange juice. Awesome Coffee. Fresh local Bread. Local jam. Spot on Green chili. Perfectly crispy Hash.   I like the El Paso. A very yummy omelet with chorizo and black beans and veggies. Get an order of green chili on the side and you will be a happy person. My wife is nuts over the french toast.  Its just a small, unassuming, little breakfast place that happens to do things VERY well. You won't find ultra hip music playing, or waitresses with super cute outfits.  Just go here wanting a good breakfast and you will leave getting exactly that. I think it is funny when people set their hopes too high for a breakfast place. I mean really, how good can an egg or hash browns be? In my opinion, this place tops the charts for the things that matter...  Do it right. Do it local. Do it cheap. Do it fast. Do it without an attitude.  If this sounds good to you, Go to OBH and enjoy.",

Our server, Andrea, was very attentive and kept checking on us to make sure we had everything we needed. My mom and I both ordered the chicken apple sausage scramble and it was amazing. It was so much food that I couldn't even finish it. They have a little display window with pastries that you can order (to eat there or to-go). The only slight downfall is that the tables are pretty close together, I could easily heard what the table next to us was talking about, and I'm sure they could hear us. Aside from that, service and price was perfect.",

I was mistaken!  It's cute inside, almost modern decor with enough 'diner' feel to know you should order breakfast.  On a Saturday morning, my boyf and I strolled in for some eggs and bacon.  It was busy, but we only waited about five minutes.  I ordered an omelette with spinach, bacon and mushroom- it was HUGE and stuffed with ingredients, not just all eggs and a few bits of spinach- I was impressed.  I could only eat half and took the rest home for yummies later.  It came with whole wheat toast (ya! for another option besides 'white') and they have local jam that was super delish!  My boyf ordered the French toast, which gets a lot of attention.  It's lightly fried, and he could not have been happier, as it also came with bacon and two eggs!  I tried the French toast, quite different from your usual soggy bread French toast with great flavor.  Price was reasonable.  Service was attentive and fast.

Wowie zowie!!! The pancakes have lemon in them and they are the fluffiest cakes I have ever eaten! The french toast is deep-fried, has orange & cinnamon in them and they are amazing! We both chose the real Vermont syrup for $1 extra, totally worth it. Oh, and this won the BF over, they have whole milk. Yep. Yummy, syrupy french toast and pancakes and WHOLE MILK.  The bacon is thick and cooked perfectly!! I didn't try the sausage but the BF said they were smokin' good! Last but not least, our server Emily is a complete sweetheart and gave us the lowdown when we first got in. Thank you for making this a great experience!!! We can't wait to come back next weekend for breakfast!!!",

We all decided to visit for a fathers day brunch. Once you enter the doors you have a west coast beach feel with all the decorative designs of surfboards and VW bus wagons.  I went ahead and ordered scrambled eggs, three strips of bacon, hash browns and two pancakes. Figured this was an appropriate meal since I LOVE breakfast! Have to say the strips of bacon were thicker than most other breakfast locations, so that was a plus! The hash browns were nice and crispy and the pancakes had a deliciously fluffy  combined with the creamy butter and syrup. I also tasted some of the french toast with strawberry, and the bread is thicker than most toast, but the liquids it was mixed with kept it nice and moist! Cannot forget about how strong flavored the black coffee complimented the meals! Overall my whole family thoroughly enjoyed there meals and appreciated the service that our server provided for our big party!",

We got seated, ordered, and the food came out in a timely manner. Their orange juice is amazing - freshly squeezed, very pulpy, and you get 1 refill on the house. I had their El Paso omelet which was really good and their pancakes have a slight lemon flavor so they were really refreshing. The family enjoyed their food too and we didnt go home hungry. The only problem I had was that the food was on the pricey side for a diner and they only accept cash. They do have a printed explanation as to why they only accept cash which I can understand but you would think that if they are trying to keep cost down, they wouldnt charge their customers so much for the food. BUT! I appreciate the delicious food and wouldn't be hesitant coming back.",

Enjoyed the local vibe. The machaca was prepared differently than I am accustomed to, but it was ok. Nothing blew me away taste wise but the service was great.",

It is a popular destination so there could be a wait, but once seated and your order placed, your meal arrives promptly.  Check out their specials on the board behind the counter.  We think you will like this family run establishment. Give it a try. What do you have to lose?  We are sure you will come back time and again like us.",

At 10 am on a Sunday they quoted a 20 minute wait,  and it was just that (that is very resonable). I do love coffee and for $2.50 you get a never ending carafe...no vanilla or hazelnut creamers, just  half and half, but the coffee is worth it. I rarely drink more than 1 cup, but had 3.  Excellent diner drip coffee!    Yes, the OJ is fresh and you get a free refill, but it IS massive orange pulp, my husband spit out 2 seeds.  Still,  the FLAVOR  is wonderful!   On to the food!   I had the El Paso Omelette,  omitted the chorizo and asked for bacon!  My husband had the San Francisco French toast, triple berry special.   Mine was 3 fluffy eggs in an omelette with God knows how many pieces of crispy, smoky crumbled bacon, that substituted the chorizo... succulent onions,  medium spicy green chiles, tender tomatoes, wonderful savory black beans and melted cheddar cheese! Along  with the home fries that were so savory and flavorful.   They reminded me of what was served from my grandmother's cast iron skillet! Plus instead of toast, got 2 fluffy, light pancakes, scented with lemon zest.  It's a very unassuming flavor, but citrus is designed to clean the palate so you can eat more without feeling so full!   Not a bad thing!    My husband's San Francisco French toast,  on sourdough and then deep fried to give that final crunch, was incredible.  And with the 3 berries (strawberry, blueberry,  blackberry) and hot  maple syrup made it a special, but not TOO sweet combo. Plus 2 over medium perfect eggs and 2 slices of exceptional crispy bacon!   We don't often get to Phoenix, but always have Sunday breakfast.  It was $33.00 plus tip, a little more for breakfast, but for what we got,  it was well worth it!",

The pancakes have a hint of lemon and are heavenly.  The home fries do not come out of a bag and I ate all of them, which is something I don't ordinarily do when eating at chain restaurants like IHOP.  However, the star of the meal was the chicken tinga omelet with boneless shredded chicken  breast cooked in adobo and topped with queso fresco - it was totally out of this world delicious!  I left full but not stuffed and will happily be adventuresome with menu selections in the future. The breakfast restaurants in Scottsdale are all overrated and believe me, I have tried them all.

Not sure if I like the lemon flavor added to the pancakes or not but the pancakes themselves were light and fluffy. The raspberries were really fresh and delicious.  He had the corned beef hash special and that came with two eggs cooked any way - he picked scrambled. Oddly enough the corned beef really tasted like salted ham, which isn't bad but not what we expected.   Overall: B+ I think we will order other options next go around but it was tasty!",

No doubt growing up a lot in intervening three years, a handful of Artisan Bakeries and Hip Brunch joints cropping up throughout the Metropolitan area, Original Breakfast House is located on N. 32nd Street and, although only born in 2011, the feel is much older - a Californian transplant achieving his goals in ownership by drawing a diverse crowd interested in the restaurant's comfort food classics.  Built on the ideals of good ingredients, smiling service and a 70's roadside decor, it was just past eight in the morning that a party of three was seated at a comfy booth near the entry point, more than half the tables already full with everything from elderly men to school-age children, the Bakery case and a Specials board each within eyeshot and offering no shortage of temptation.  Opting to dine in two-rounds, a total of four baked goods and two plates from the kitchen decided to be more desirable than the rest, items from the counter were presented re-warmed and partially melting, the Brioche Cinnamon Roll not as springy as some and more like Cinnabon while the Morning Glory Muffin was moist, dense and pleasant with a whole lot of Carrots and natural sweetness in the base.  Pleased by the creamy Lemon Scone, though less-so by a Poptart whose shell was unfortunately thicker and even more mealy than the Kellogg original, a stack of Triple Berry Pancakes with $1-supplement Pure Maple Syrup was par for the course with bursting berries both inside and on top of them while the Chicken-fried Chicken with Country Gravy and a slice of fried French Toast was worthy of highlighted-status as the Bird was crisp and juicy while the Bread was golden on the outside with its center Custard-soft.",

So that was cool   The location is great and the parking was easy. I had an artichoke bacon goat cheese omelette it was fabulous, fruit and a BIG fluffy biscuit with butter and jam YUMMY it was the \"BOMB\". So we were two ladies who wanted to chat and have a \"catch up\" and we were Seated next to the loudest family with two toddlers crying. That was a bummer but it's ok, we could have said something but we didn't. This is a CASH only establishment and that was quite a suprise but it IS posted when you walk in and hey have an ATM . I had cash so that was ok as well, but if I hadn't I tend to be a little persnickety about such things. Now I know and all is good.

The staff was friendly and the owners were very nice. They have large portions of food for a really reasonable price. If you are going to eat here make sure you bring cash because credit cards are NOT accepted here. They do have an ATM that has no fees because they cover the cost and they do take checks. They even have an honor system if you forget to bring cash they will take down your name and wait for you to return with the money.  I always thought people from California were rude and arrogant people, but this family that runs this place are a different type of  Californian. I promise you will not be disappointed.",

I've tried a few of the breakfast options: San Francisco style french toast; banana-pecan pancakes; biscuits and gravy; Spam and eggs; the Big Gooey Scramble Mess (share that one); - all good.    Last time, the daily special was an \"Indiana Style Pork Tenderloin Sandwich\" - had to order that, since those are few and far between outside of the Hoosier home-state.  It was pretty darned good (I like it plain, with mustard and lots of pickles - give it a try!).  The coffee is good, and the servers keep you topped off (or leave a carafe for you).  Service is great, and everyone we've encountered on the staff has been great.  This is a great local place to hang out, grab a bite, and support the community (the restaurant, and their suppliers).  Come check them out!",

The wait staff was very attentive and quick to respond to anything that we had requested. Just for the courtesy of the staff and the promptness I'll give it 5 stars.  The food was unfortunately not to my expectations. Perhaps I was over expecting based on all the previous reviews which I looked over as I was waiting to be seated. I had an omelet and the French toast and while the omelette wasn't bad it was nothing spectacular. I found the French toast to be exceedingly oily and that alone left with me not wanting to come back. The coffee we had was not bad, the orange juice was freshly squeezed and definitely delectable. Like everyone else is already mentioned the portions are generously sized and the prices are reasonable.   For the food alone I would give it 3 stars but the overall experience and the exceptional service pushes it up to 4.",

Service: we had a party of 5 and they were swift and attentive. They came by with the waters and coffee. We told them we had some place to be after and they listened and helped us out. The venue is clean and cute. I loved watching the home made orange juice being made.   Food: I got the eggs bacon hash browns and pancakes. I loved the crispy hash browns and cool that they give you three slices of thick bacon! What I really liked was the pancakes. They were so yummy and sweet. That home made jam was the best. I would ask for it if I went again and put that on the pancakes and toast! My sister got the gooey eggs with potatoes sausage mush egg and it was huge and super yummy.   Fresh and delish and yummy! I would come back. And I will try some other pancake variety.",

It's a dollar or two higher than it should be, but because this place is busy, I understand the higher price, especially since they say they pay their staff well.  What I do not understand, or agree with, is the new cash only policy. Absolutely absurd!  After several years in business, they now say it's because it's too time consuming for them to accept credit cards, and that the cost is too high. I've owned several businesses, and I've never paid more than 2.9% to accept a credit card. If it's a real financial problem, raise your prices 2- 3% which is pennies and a non-issue, and don't play games with the customers who made this place popular in tje first place.  You say there's a free ATM out front, except it's not free. Since it's a private ATM, all major banks charge a several dollar fee to use that ATM.   Funny how virtually 100% of sit down restaurants take credit cards, yet you guys think it's too complicated, and doesn't work for you. You pass the buck, literally, and the nconvenience onto your previously loyal customers.   Your new, silly, cash-only policy t's basically a money grab, where you're banking on your past strong reputation, and taking advantage of people, so you can pocket more cash.  That's shady. It's not right, and I suspect that in the longrun customers will not tolerate it and your greed will not pay off.",

    "text": "Looking for a great breakfast and relied on YELP. A little out of our way, going home to Vegas but it was a learning experience. The place was still crowded at 10 am on a Sunday, good sign, got seated within a half hour.  The staff was friendly and attentive, so a 4 star there; the food was something else. After all the hype we read from the pictures and the previous reviews, we expected better. I had the crab omelet special; it was bland, the hollandaise sauce had no taste and it was just crab meat with minimal amount of cheese added to it. The home fries were burnt or over cooked (I looked and seen other plates and this was the norm); very disappointing. My spouse had the French Toast with strawberries. It looked good upon presentation, but the crust was unedible, like it was deep fried or something. We also ordered a side  rib eye steak and that was over cooked. All and all, IHOP would have been a better place to have breakfast. So over all, a 3 star and that's being nice.",

They also use locally grown and some organic items. The pancakes are delicious, with a pleasant, light taste of lemon in the batter. My omelet was $10.95 BUT came with 2 sides (I chose home fries and pancakes), so there is plenty of yummy food for the price. It's a must try!",

All of the bad reviews of this place had to do with them only accepting CASH as payment.  There were no complaints about the food so I figured I would try it.  We arrived, cash in hand at about 9:30 on a Sunday morning.  As I approached the door I noticed the \"SORRY, CASH ONLY\" sign.  We waited about 30-40 minutes to be seated (always a sign of a good place) and were immediately acknowledged by a smiling server who took our drink order.  On the way to our table, I couldn't help but notice several more signs explaining the CASH ONLY policy.  We had pancakes, french toast, chicken-fried steak and biscuits and gravy.  All of it was good and reasonably priced.  Our check came and I handed the server a credit card.  She took it like a champ and was as pleasant as can be.  I highly recommend you try this place.  And oh...they only accept CASH!",

    "text": "Love this place.  Went there Saturday morning with one of my college age nieces while her car was getting worked on.  One word, AMAZING. I'm not an adventurous eater at all so I stuck with the basics.  Scrambled eggs with melted cheese on top, bacon, hashbrowns and whole wheat toast and of course black coffee.  I have to say, the bacon was about as perfect as bacon can be.  I mean, bacon, it makes everything better right?  But this stuff was amazing.  Crisp, but not burnt, not at all soggy or undercooked, not all shriveled up like some of the cheaper cuts of bacon.  This stuff was PERFECT and oh so tasty.  Needless to say, the bacon was gone before I even considered the rest of the plate.  The eggs were excellent as were the hashbrowns and the nice thick toast.  Now onto the service. We pulled into the parking lot, the place was packed.  We checked in and they said about 15 minutes.  Well, they were spot on.  Inside of 15 minutes we had a table.  Our waitress, I'm sorry but I can't recall her name, was very friendly and helpful.  She wasn't overbearing by coming back to check on us too often but she was right there when my coffee needed a top off.  We had a nice quick chat about how bacon is the perfect food and how the we like our coffee the same, strong with no junk added.  Food was out quick and like I mentioned, damn good.  My only regret, was not getting the pancakes after seeing the ones my niece had ordered.  Dang, those looked good!  Next time, the pancakes will be mine.  The only \"negative\" point in my view is they recently switched to cash only.  They do post a nice explanation on why they are cash only and as someone who has previously worked in retail business, it makes sense.  They do provide a free ATM inside the restaurant so that does help.  I can't ding them on the cash only part, it's their way of paying the employees more and they sure all seemed to be in good spirits when we were there.  All hustling about and everyone I saw was smiling.  Well worth what some people might consider the hassle of paying in cash.",

I guess you really can't go wrong with great sourdough, custard-like egg dip and the deep frying. Delish!  My husband said the pancakes were \"the best he ever had!\" you can taste the orange zest and it was light and yet filling.  We also had the Juan's tacos -- they were satisfying and quintessentially southwest breakfast.  BUT the best part was the Patty's brioche cinnamon buns. Holy Amazing.",

Hostess (who may have also been family) was full of personality, too. Nice people. Restaurant was clean, modern, nice decor. Good coffee, flavored creamers, they left the coffee pitcher in the table, which is great. Water pitcher on the table, too. Great service. Waitresses actually seemed to enjoy working there, and I assume that a good portion of the reason for that was the leadership and management. Food was excellent too. I had the juevos rancheros and my husband had the chorizo burrito. When I couldn't decide on my side item, and chose beans, the waitress pointed out that there were beans in the juevos, so I switched to potatoes. That really showed she cared and was thinking. I appreciated that. The potatoes were excellent. Husband loved the burrito. I found this place online last night, listed as one of the best breakfast places in Phoenix, and I can see why. I don't think it even took 5 mins to get our food. We drove almost 45 mins from Gilbert to come here, and we'll be back!",

We are SO glad we did.  The staff are all very pleasant and make for a positive experience as soon as you walk in the door. The portion sizes are plenty of food to fill you up at very reasonable prices. Coffee was wonderful, exactly what a nice breakfast brew should be. The eggs have been perfectly cooked on both plates both times we were there. And the fresh squeezed orange juice just CAN'T be beat. VERY pulpy which for me is a huge plus. Also, their cinnamon rolls are outstanding; large and fluffy with just the right amount of sweetness.  The biscuit gravy, unfortunately left a lot to be desired. It had a sweet quality that I've never had in breakfast gravy and didn't work for me at all. The hashbrowns, while good, not too oily/butter and reasonably salted, are pretty inconsistent. The first time we went, we had one order that was very overdone and another order that was very underdone while the second time we went, the one order we had was just right.  I can't speak to the french toast, though I know it's something they're known for and it's definitely something I plan to try. Not the best breakfast joint in the world but a more than satisfactory experience that is well worth the money.",

The omelette is good but the toast was thick and burn/hard. The hash browns are crispy on top but in the middle it's very soft, I wish they were crispy everywhere. The food definitely tasted homemade.   My brother got the linguica and cheese which is scramble eggs with Portuguese sausage and cheese.

    "text": "Original Breakfast House   Wow! This place is so good. It's a local spot in North Phoenix that has a very laid back vibe. More than a dozen various surf boards, skateboards and an autographed Alice Cooper Guiter adorn the walls's and posts with a very beach centric theme. There is a written message / mural near the front door notifying customers of the OBH efforts to use local and organic food.   One thing to be aware of. This place is cash only. If you only have a card, no worries. There is a no-fee ATM in the lobby.   Here's our thoughts on what we had:  Cinnamon Roll: These are strategically placed near the front door in a bakery style case and it definitely worked on us. We started with the Cinnamon Roll which was perfectly warm and gooey. The bread is perfect and the icing was delicious. Grade: A+  El Paso Omelette: We got this without the black beans and it was O-MAZING. The flavor of the chorizo, the cheese melted inside the omelette, green chili's, salsa, guac and sour cream were a home run. This is one of those places where by this one dish, you know all of the other food is going to be dynamite. My wife and I split this dish and it was a perfect size for us. Grade: A+  Hash Browns: Very well done. A lot of crunch on top with side potatoes on the inside. Perfect. Grade: A  Biscuits: These were a little above average. They are definitely fluffy and have a tang of buttermilk. We made them better by adding butter and some of the local organic honey they provided. The biscuit is a perfect base for their home made jelly as well. Grade: B-  Bacon: Perfectly cooked. Not over done but not soggy at all. A good level of crunch and packed with flavor. Grade: A  Pancakes: These hit me with a surprise. The good part is they are very good as well as gluten free. The part I wasn't expecting was the lemon zest. It wasn't bad, just unexpected. I don't care for fruit or fruit flavors to be mixed into my breakfast foods but I'm sure many people will like them. The butter and syrup were on point as well. Grade B+  Service: As much as we loved the food we were especially thrilled with our server, Seta. Always on time, friendly, appropriately talkative and kind. Everyone seemed to love their jobs and that is a reflection on the ownership. The waitress also told us the owner allows the chef free reign to try new things and that great pairing shows in the food. Grade: A++   Summary: We will definitely be back and with friends and family. Wherever you are in the valley, make the trip to OBH and you won't leave disappointed.",

    "text": "Came in around 7:40am on a Saturday and didn't have to wait for a table of two, but there were still already a good amount of people inside. Like all of the other reviews and tips, yes this place is cash only but they do have an ATM. Reading why they made the decision sits well with me so be sure to grab some cash and come check this place out!  The inside is cute, it's very diner meets a beachy/surf board theme. We were greeted as soon as we walked in by friendly faces and taken to a table. Our waitress stopped by shortly after and was super nice, grabbing our drink orders. We stuck with iced tea and water to start.   The menu is a good size and had a lot of appetizing items. I was torn on several of them but finally settled on the pancake special: I chose raspberry chocolate pancakes, bacon and scrambled eggs.   The pancakes were awesome.. the raspberry added a great tart flavor to balance the chocolate. They don't skimp on filling either, lots of chocolate chips and raspberry in the batter as well as on top. They also brought a side of syrup and butter depending on your pancake preferences. The bacon is thicker cut but isn't too crispy and isn't too soft. Great flavor. The eggs were good as well.   My girlfriend got the chicken and waffles which comes with a side of sausage gravy, as well as butter and syrup too. You get two large fried pieces of chicken breast and a full waffle. The chicken is awesome and pairs nicely with the waffle. The waffle isn't soggy and has a nice outer \"crunch\" to it. The sausage gravy was delicious and would go well over some biscuits. Portion sizes were huge for both meals.   She also ordered a glass of milk to come out with our food. She orders this with breakfast a lot and most places forget it.. which is understandable since drinks normally come out first but our waitress remembered and brought it out with our food! She was on top of everything, brought refills and was honestly just genuinely so nice.   I saw some people walking up to the register to pay but our waitress actually took our check from us and brought us back change. I'm not sure which way is the \"usual\" way but hey, we paid!  Overall I'd definitely recommend coming here for breakfast and will absolutely return. Awesome!",

I posted some photos I took of their policy as to why they only take cash.***  One of my buddies from work constantly raved about this place. We finally had the time to check it out on 26 JUL 2018 AD. The vibe of the place is a little, \"California\", there are some surf boards posted on the walls and the dining area is laid-back.  The food, service and menu offerings were off-the-charts!!! Everything was terrific! The price was decent and the portion size sufficient. The establishment was clean and organized.  I shall return if in the area again, and whole-heartily recommend this restaurant to family and friends! A solid 5 stars!!!",

My family and I ate here once before and we said we'd never go back because our food was room temperature when it was served and nothing we ordered was all that great. Last weekend we tried it again. Same thing as before, but this time we got horrible service. It was an hour before they closed, but still packed. Our waiter never refilled coffee and didn't ask how everything was- the usual thing that good waiters do. She just seemed like she had enough of that shift. This place is average at best, I'm sorry to say.",

My husband and I came here frequently, we looove this place, we love the owner and his son, and we love the staff! Knowing my love for this place my family agreed to meet me here at 9 am, after not seeing each other for 3 years. I called ahead of time, not to make a reservation because they dont take them, but to make them aware a large party of 6 and 1 high chare would be coming in at 9. I got a voicemail and no answer. Oh well, I tried.  My sister checked us in at 9Am. After seating after seating after seating of newly arrived folks we became a bit impatient and my sister asked how much longer, we had been waiting 30 minutes at this point. I checked in 10 minutes later and was 10 minutes more! I was told there was a table they are holding and they were just waiting on another table to leave.   They ended up sitting a single lady at our saved table then filled the table of 4 right after which was supposed to be the table we were waiting on... seriously.   I love that your staff is so personable and tried, but the hostess seating people was not good at her job. After witnessing her seat people at the 4 seater table we were waiting on we decided to leave. I am so bummed. I know this place is super popular and for good reason. The food is always exceptional, always!   If you are in a party of 4 or larger, just don't bother to come here.",

    "text": "Came here with my mom for a school project. When we got inside it was very Hawaiian and the outside doesn't look Hawaiian at all. It is cash only so you have to come here with the bills. The inside is very airy and spacious and quiet. You may need a jacket if you have thin blood because it's pretty cold. When we sat down the waitress was very polite and calm, my mom got ice tea and she said it was average but she would drink it again. I got orange juice that was freshly squeezed, it had pulp in it and I don't like pulp but it is so good and fresh. When we ordered I got the spam and eggs and my mom got the John Wayne western omelet. The food took about 10-15 minutes to get from the kitchen which was quick. I got the spam and eggs because my man Steven and lady Pua are from Hawaii and that inspired me. When we got our food the spam and eggs was really good, the eggs were really fluffy and airy. When you order something it comes with one or two pancakes and the flavor depends on what you order. Under the spam and eggs was cilantro and lime rice, and when I tried it, it immediately hit my gag reflect as hard as a rock, but I don't like cilantro so that's probably why. My mom said her omelet was very fluffy and full of great tastes. She got two plain pancakes and she said that they were kind of fruity in a good way. Her dish also came with hash browns and she said they were not greasy at all and had a nice crispy outside and had a nice soft tasty inside. Like I said you can only pay with cash but they have an atm with no tax inside. This restaurant from the outside looks like a diner but it's not. This place is like a hidden gem and I definitely recommend coming here for a nice breakfast with the family, and by the way it's closes at 2 pm. This place was extraordinary.",

Already theres a pitcher of water, cups, and the server asks if youd like some coffee. The restuarant has a very friendly and home-y feel.   I ordered the pancake special which comes with a choice of sausage and/or bacon, 2 eggs, and 2 pancakes. Delicious!  My boyfriend ordered the green chilli omelette with carnitas. He said the spice sneaks up on you (in a good way) and was overall delicious. Though it might be a bit too much for your stomach in the morning!   Would definitely come back. LOve this place!!",

They offered chorizo and such along with basic pancakes and eggs Benedict. Overall, they had a good variety of food items on the menu. My boyfriend and I shared a scramble (I don't recall the name) that included egg whites, mushrooms, spinach, and pico de gallo. I wasn't completely thrilled about it, hence the 3 stars. It was OK. We had to send the hash browns back because they were too mushy and didn't have that crisp factor to it; They came out perfect after and the server was completely understanding. This place is a cool, casual spot. Again, not great, but not bad. I MIGHT go back if I'm around that area again.",

Very cute place too with fun decorations. This will be our go to place for breakfast down in the valley. You will not be disappointed.",

I ordered lunch. I decided on the Monte Cristo sandwich with incredibly delicious melt in my mouth ham and Swiss with a Dijon mix, and fresh fruit with homemade fresh ham for dipping. It was the best Monte Cristo I have ever had! Our waitress was enthusiastic and helpful. She was attentive and checked back with us frequently. The rest of the employees were also friendly and helpful--clearing away our dishes and inquiring if everything was to our satisfaction. This restaurant is a gem.

The staff was great. They were super busy but the food arrived very fast.  For the past 40 years I've kind of disliked veteran's day because it was a day when other people got off work and businesses used it to sell stuff. I got a little choked up today how nice the staff was, the whole meal was free and the waitress even told the fellow vet I was sitting next to that a tip wasn't necessary. She really meant it. It's not that is was free, it's that they did it with such class. This wasn't a marketing scheme, they really wanted to thank veterans, I don't really know what to say. You made me feel so special like I've never felt. It is something I will never forget. And Veteran's Day for the first time for me was about veterans. I can't thank you enough.  You're now My Restaurant.  They won't say it on their menu or on their web site but when you dine at the Original Breakfast House you are saying thanks to veterans too. So I thank all the diners at Original Breakfast House for helping them make this such a special day for us.",

    "text": "Let me say that the owners that had it for decades are gone.  The \"new\" owner has had the restaurant about 3 years. The wait on a Saturday late morning was about 20 minutes for a table for two.  Not too bad. The noise level in the restaurant itself was ABOMINABLE.   The wait staff needed more help (as in bussers, drink order takers, etcetera) A LOT more help.  We needed a minute to look at the menu since it was our first visit, and we thought the server was never coming back.  This is not a slam to the server at all, it was just a busy mad house.  It got to the point that I told my companion that it was so loud I was getting a headache and that if she didn't come back in a little bit, I wanted to leave. SO GLAD WE DIDN'T! The food.  We both ordered the same thing.  The Farmers Market veggie omelet with the home fries. Holy crap. I hope the home fries didn't have MSG in them, but they were so good, it would be a sin that I forgive. The omelet was probably made with butter-I wouldn't change a THING.  I told my companion that next time we come, we are bringing earplugs and a newspaper.  It's worth it.  On a side note, we ordered a cinnamon bun to split-not worth the calories.  The owner came around and was very pleasant.  All in all, I was super satisfied with the food and the service.  On a side note, they had a hostess that was wearing a very skimpy shirt, and for some reason, it made me very uncomfortable that I could see so much skin when she bent down to fix a table leg...",

    "text": "A group of seven of us went on Sunday morning, at the suggestion of a regular customer in our group.  My first impression was that the place was dingy and old looking - needs a significant  face lift!  Because of that, I expected that instead of spending money on remodeling they would give discounts for the lack of atmosphere - NOT SO!!  We eat out regularly and this place is more expensive than the Scottsdale breakfast places that we eat.  Another minus is one piece of toast with a breakfast.  COME ON!!  The least expensive part of the breakfast and they don't even provide two pieces, a standard???    Now to the food.............they used cheap packaged ground bacon in the omelette that we ordered - looks and tastes like dog food!  Then we all made the mistake of ordering toast with breakfast and they just could NOT get their act together and get the toast on the table.  We ended up getting our toast to the table after we had finished our breakfast.  If a place that is a breakfast place can't get toast on the table with breakfast, where do you go from there.  Perhaps investment in a commercial toaster would help; the hostess says that they put their toast on the grill(??).  When we had several conversations with the hostess that we were unhappy about not having toast, it didn't seem to make a difference.  We really expected to see the manager/owner come to our table and at least apologize - NOPE!!  Our friend that is a regular was really embarrassed that things went so badly.  NEVER AGAIN!!  As we were leaving, there were several people outside waiting for a table.  I wanted to advise them that there are MUCH better places for breakfast:  the Breakfast Joint, Butters, Perk Eatery, the Breakfast Club; and they are also cheaper with better quality of food.",

Then food is cooked homestyle, like Mom or grandma used to cook. The orange juice is fresh squeezed & has pulp but, OMG, so worth it, with 1 free refill. The jelly is also made in house so only 1 flavor but, again,  very worth it. On the weekends,  there is always a packed house, with a long wait but the owner's have put up a canopy for people to sit under, out of the sun, & have free bottles of iced water for people to drink during the wait. Don't give up if you have to wait because it's worth it!",

I personally don't care for their fresh squeezed oj- it's just too pulpy for my liking, but I know it's a fan favorite. Beware the pancakes have an orange/lemon zest thing going on and me and my kids don't care for that too much but the French toast is so good! The staff is always extremely friendly and the owners walk around and say hello. There will always be a line on weekend mornings (unless you plan to get there EARLY) but it's worth it.",

I found this place on Yelp and it was the BEST breakfast I've had in a long time. What makes the restaurant is the service. The owner, John, was very friendly and just came up to talk to us. Our server, Divina, was also super sweet and spent some time to talk to us even though she was busy. The food came out quick and the fresh strawberry deep fried french toast was amazing! Prices were reasonable, I'd definitely recommend this place and we will be returning when we're back in Arizona again.",

This is a good place to go if you're HUNGRY at breakfast time and don't mind not talking over the meal.  The food is good.  The eggs were done to perfection, and the hash browns were very crispy--not greasy--just the way we like it.    A huge drawback is the horrific noise levels.  The place was almost full, but not every table was filled, and there wasn't a waiting line, so I can't even imagine how loud it is in there when the place is full and people are waiting!  I couldn't hear anything for a while after leaving--my ears were actually ringing!  And I really felt sorry for my elderly friend who wears a hearing aid--I think it was excruciating for her.  Not to mention that we couldn't catch up over breakfast as we had planned because we couldn't hear each other!  Honestly, I think the staff there should get frequent hearing checks or wear earplugs while being exposed to such noise.    I like the food well enough to order takeout to bring to the office, but when I called, the message said they do not take phone orders.  I don't want to sit outside in the heat--or inside in the horrific noise--while waiting for an order to be cooked for me to take out, so I won't be back.",

The sausage was a thick link with not too much flavor. The Vermont \"real\" maple syrup was pretty tasty. Same for my buddy's hash browns. But we were in a little bit of a hurry, and only ate some of the hash browns and sausage.  I'll give this place another try. And I'm sure our waitress would have corrected our issue if we gave her the chance. Some people tip less if the food isn't right, but we didn't give her a chance to correct it.

We don't live near PV but would definitely drive 40 mins for a great breakfast from here. We bought cinnamon roll & pop tart on the way out. The cinnamon roll was perfect warmed. The pop tart was ok the crust was thick for my liking and it had strawberry jam in the center. We chatted with our server about majority of the food. She was excellent, very knowledgeable of where the food came from (majority local). This is a busy place for a reason, be patient it's well worth it! **it's also now CASH only w/ATM in house. All around well thought and well done place.",

But when we got our food (pancakes with bananas & pecans, pancakes with raspberries & chocolate, French toast, ooey gooey mess, breakfast potatoes, scrambled eggs, sausage, & OJ) it wasn't worth the drool! If you took away the extras that they put in their pancakes, the pancakes are terrible tasting. There was no, or not much flavor to the food. To be completely honest: when you deep fry French toast, you loose the flavor of the French toast. I did like their breakfast potatoes & OJ....that's it! The service was friendly.",

I ordered the country fried steak, (came with hash browns, eggs, AND pancakes which I subbed.) My over hard eggs were not runny at all, cooked to perfection, and the country fried steak breading wasn't falling off like it always does other places. Tender, delicious, and juicy! The gravy, oh my GOD the gravy. Made from scratch, they mean business. And, dont let me forget the FRESHLY squeezed orange juice, that was literally squeezed right before our eyes behind the counter, freshest orange juice I've ever had. It was amazing. My fiance ordered the biscuits n gravy, with fried potatos, and a ham steak. The potatos were perfect and not overly seasoned, just how she likes em. The ham steak we shared was bursting with flavor, I can't pin it, but it was mouthwatering... my pancakes were fluffy and light, not heavy at all..and had a delightful little hint of lemon. I've never heard of that in a pancake, but it was the best pancakes I've ever had. Everything was top notch. The only thing was that the sugar container had accidentally been filled with salt, so when we drank our coffee which we had salted up generously, we quickly had bitter, tart faces of disgust and surprise. Ugh. But.. the owner or manager (Not sure who he was) came over immediately and fixed the problem, replaced our coffee, creamer, and sugar, and took our coffee off the bill. Everyone was very friendly and cheery, the place was busy but spacious, and bright, and we absolutely loved our visit this morning.",

The mixed berry French toast looks very good so I decided to go back a second time to try those. They were very disappointing. They were deep-fried all you could taste was the oil they had been fried in the only plus to them was that the berries were fresh! With all the rave reviews i had expected a much better meal and I gave them two tries, I will not be going back again my money is better spent somewhere else.",

The building use to be an old Denny's so it has that classic dinner feel but the interior definitely is more Caly.  The menu states the importance of how all the food and ingredients are either organic or locally based, coffee included.  My wife was on a gluten-free diet at the time so having the wide variety of menu options made her happy, in fact the pancakes she had were the best (GF) she's ever had.  I stuck with one of their specialties, \"Chxn-fried-Chxn\" which came with a side of French Toast.  I would recommend getting a fresh topping on the French Toast, such as banana pecan, though it tastes good without as well.  The service was excellent even though it was busy. The owner was helping the staff in a variety of ways while keeping a smile, which is always a good thing to see.  The overall quality to portion ratio was excellent and the pricing was reasonable.  The coffee was so good I took some on the go.  The only thing it's lacking is a larger seating area, noticed families had to split booths among each other.",

Didn't really care for the French toast as it is deep fried and is more like something you'd expect to get at a county fair. Just a little too greasy for me. Otherwise the meal was good both times.  They're going to no longer accept credit cards based on fees. While I get that, cash only isn't going to work out. They're going to put a ATM in front but that's just more fees for me even if they don't have it charge a fee my bank will. Based on the inconvenience of having to use cash when I should be able to use my phone, and the good but not great food I probably won't be back.",

We had coffee, cinnamon roll, biscuits and gravy and the egg/bacon/pancake combo. Cinnamon roll could've used more flavor, I did like that the frosting wasn't overly sweet. The biscuits and gravy no complaints. I ordered the gluten free granola and banana pancakes. I was disappointed when they came out because I thought the granola and banana would be in the batter, instead it was sprinkled on top.   Also slightly inconvenient that they only accept cash. There are TONS of signs to let you know. They have a sign saying free ATM but that doesn't mean your bank won't charge you for using it. They have a long explanation on their menu saying that they pay over $50k in merchant fees and they would rather pay their employees more (which is thoughtful). However don't most businesses get to write off merchant fees? Or they could just charge customers a fee for using their card or even work it into their food prices. Anyways. If you try out this place, bring cash.",

Plenty of parking, friendly service, and we were seated in like 10 minutes.  We got the best seat in the house, a booth by the Northwest corner : ) Our server was very nice, friendly and accommodating to our special requests.  They seem to serve organic and local produce, cage free eggs, freshly squeezed juice, and, all this at very affordable (competitive) prices.  I had the special, pork chops and eggs. Hubby had one of the omelettes with a substitution to try the Brazilian sausage (Linguica)  We also tried the hush browns and the house potatoes, both were good but next we will probably order the home ones.  We ordered our regular extra crispy side of bacon, and when it first arrived it was not very crispy, so they took it back and then it was a little too tough (oops)... maybe because it is slightly thicker than the regular you get at some other breakfast places.  The food choices I thought were reasonable priced, bacon I thought it was a little pricey $3.95 for 3 slices, and coffee and soft drinks I believe are $2.50.  Multi-grain toast was good, and it comes with a small container with strawberry jam, feels like home made : ) Hubby got a biscuit and it was kind of tough, but as soon as we brought it to the attention of our server it was promptly replaced.  I do not expect everything to be perfect, but rather we pay attention to how things are handled when something goes wrong. Also, service industry is a lot about attitude and everyone here seemed to be very happy and positive.  : ) We are glad we found them!",

Literally, the morning of, we settled on this place after a few yelp searches and boy am I glad we chose this place!  Even with the recent bad review about the crab omelet, I took a chance and ordered that with the hollandaise sauce - YUMMY! It was filled with lump crab, moist, tender, and delicious!   Kid friendly atmosphere - which is great, I'm very picky about where I dine out with my daughter as to not disturb others but she had fun, lots of other kids around her, and people several booths away were waving hi and keeping her engaged and smiling away.  The reason for 4 stars: they could've used a few more servers and bussers to help with drink refills.   I'm definitely planning on going back and planning on bringing my immediate/extended family with me - we all love a good place to grub and this one is on the list!",

The chicken could have used some salt in the breading or gravy but the potatoes were seasoned well so I just ate them together. The French toast was my fave! It was buttery and a bit crisp on the outside but soft on the inside. The coffee is also good!  It's super busy so it took a while for my server to come to my table (which is understandable) but she was a gem.  I would come back, maybe not during peak hours but I enjoyed it overall.",

The French toast is awesome and if you're looking for something different you have to try the chilaquiles.  One of my favorite parts is they leave the coffee pot on the table!  Service is 5/5 every time. Everyone is always so friendly and not in the fake only doing it for a good tip kinda way. Genuinely nice people all around!  The only down side is there's always a little bit of a wait on the weekends but there's plenty of seats in the waiting area and it's definitely worth it!",

    "text": "Came here Sunday, to do a family breakfast, since my future brother in law was in town with his wife. Breakfast was at 8:30am, we got there around 8:15am, table for 7 adults and 2 kids please! Gentleman told us it would be a 15 to 20 minute wait, about 35 to 40 minutes later I can see and hear the lady up front tell the gentleman that gave us the estimated time she was going to talk to 'Kathy' about the wait; never talked to me. After we finally got seated, my BIL came inside from being outside in the cold, and  surprised everyone.  I ordered the big ooey gooey mess or whatever it was called and it was alright, I expected more sausage, but maybe it was covered by the large amount of home fries. I loved the amount of cheese in it though! But that's about it, my pancakes were fluffy as well, so that's a plus. Boyfriend got the San Francisco style pecan and banana French toast I believe, and he hated it. The texture was way too chewy for him, and everyone else at the table who tried it. I boxed up my left overs and gave it to my dog, I didn't want to waste my food, my boyfriend left his. Our server was nice and decently attentive though, wasn't too bad of an experience but also wasn't memorable.  As for the other 5 entrees the rest of the table ordered, only one of them decided to take the other half of their sandwich home and the rest didn't finish their breakfast either. BIL said his hash browns were really soggy and not crisp and seemed like they've been sitting there for a while, and commented as to how this place had 4.5 stars and such great reviews.   Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be driving from Gilbert to here again.",

The OBH is okay, they have very friendly staff and good service.  Everything that is normal in a breakfast place.  Now when it comes to the menu I had the Popeye omelette which had spinach, mushrooms, bacon and onions.  Not bad, it was good, but it was also $10.75 for something that was basically \"okay\".  My significant other had the Big Gooey Scrambled Mess.  Eggs with potatoes, sausage, mushrooms and onions with a boat load of cheddar cheese all scrambled together.  Eggs slightly overcooked and overall it was good, but again not $10.00 good.      Now one item we had really stood out- their scones.  Yes, the cranberry lemon scones which was phenomenally delicious and whatever secret recipe they have, it works!  So don't get me wrong, this a great little breakfast place with some good people that try hard, but for the prices they charge I would expect something to have a bit more flavor and taste to really wow me.",

Many places have frequented this location, but this one by far is the best.  The restaurant is clean and well managed.  The wait staff is friendly and makes the dining experience that much better.....  I had the steak and eggs to celebrate my birthday.  It was quite a treat for $10.00.  In addition, I was able to sample the pancakes and hash browns.  Everything tastes great and is made with the finest ingredients.  In addition, the food arrive warm and in under 20 minutes.  The one thing that I especially enjoyed was the option to include real maple syrup (not the heavily processed stuff in a plastic bottle) for $1.00 more.  That in itself made the breakfast memorable.  The prices are extremely reasonable.   If you are looking for a breakfast destination in Phoenix, look no further.",

However, your staff lacks personality and they seem to be  \"deer in the head lights\". There is a difference between a Server and an Order taker. So, far both times we've had Order takers.  \"Hi, are you ready?\"  Opposed to:  Hello, how are you guys?  Have you been here before?  Let me tell you about our daily specials and let me recommend a few of my favorites. Nope, we got, are you ready? -- both times.  Going to the counter to pay, again no personality, lifeless humans standing there doing a job.    Manager(s), you may want to wander around and do table checks. I can tell you want this place to do well, but, with your LIFELESS staff, it's going to be a stretch to be successful.  I mean --  jeez, even at Denny's we get some personality.    There is no personality here -- zombies, taking orders and doing a \"job.\"  Just because your organic, doesn't mean you need have lifeless attitudes.   Say hi, be fun, enjoy your customers, look people in the eye, check up on tables regularly, and when its time for your NEW Clients to pay their bills --  this is when you should be asking your NEW clientele, \"How was your experience?\"   We will try your restaurant one more time, but if it's the same next time - No more repeat visits for us.  For those who know good service -- it won't take long for  people to spread the word.  So,  Are you amazing or below average?  You choose.   Right now, Your below average.   I hope you'll take this review and \"Step it up!\"  Its very fixable right now.    See you next time......I pray you can \"step it up\" and bring some personality to your service staff. Right now, it's stale.",

I remember the food being okay, if you're in the area check it out but it's not worth making a special trip for. The breakfast meat is expensive for how little you get, and it doesn't taste that great either. They up charge you for maple syrup, just get the regular syrup, you won't be able to tell the difference. The pancakes were alright, I think I had apple cinnamon or something like that. Not the worst breakfast I've had but not the best.",

All of  which was very very tasty & a lot spicy( which I was not made aware of, my waitress didn't specify nor is there a sign to tell you, other than the fact that it was chorizo) also sitting in a little puddle of green chile sauce which made my burrito a little soggy. the French toast is delicious and really one of a kind it's crispy like friend ice cream, I would highly recommend to anybody. The staff was friendly and it was an overall good experience. Only downside was that also our table was small and cluttered. We had a pitcher of water, two cups, sugar basket, hot sauce, salt and pepper plus a jar of sugar.  There has to be a better way to organize that, but that won't stop us from ordering French toast.(:",

Portions are on the \"you may hurt yourself trying to finish it all.\"   I always have leftovers to take home. Well unless I am hungover then the chicken fried steak and french toast special has no chance.  The owner is always checking to make sure everything is great. I have dined with people that have food allergies and when ordering they forgot to have some of the ingredients listed on the menu removed. When the food came out she was not able to eat it. She figured she ordered it wrong so she would take it home for someone else to eat. The waitress asked why she was not eating and insisted that they remake the food so she could enjoy a meal with the rest of us.   For quality and quantity of food the prices are very fair.  Don't let the lines detour you they move fast.   P.S. I had planned to take a picture of my meal but when the food arrived it looked so good I dug in and was half way done by the time I remembered I wanted to take a picture.",

Ordered the blueberry pancakes with a hint of lemon. Pretty good. Not bad at all. Blueberries are not freshly picked but I was ok with that. If that keeps the prices down it fine with me. We also ordered the steak and eggs. The steak was seasoned and cooked to perfection. You could tell someone was passionate about the product that they were going to deliver. In fact it was so good I had to ask what kind of seasoning they used on the steak. The owner came over and spent time telling us about the seasoning and the steak. Nice touch.

    "text": "OK, so we stumbled upon this place on a sleepy Sunday morning. I was so happy to see it, we were starving. Note: There are NO breakfast places along Shea Blvd....  I didn't even notice the \"all local organic\" thingy till we got inside. Nice I like that.  I did notice a disgusting sewer smell. No, it was not eggs. Just as I was thinking \"maybe its me\" a toddler voice shouted \"Mommy it stanks in here\" Toddlers don't lie. It did stink.  As I prayed whatever it was that stunk would go away, I pondered the menu. Not extensive but alright: eggs, omelets, french toast, pancakes.  The stink did come and go, thank gawd it wasn't constant, I wouldn't have been able to handle that.  I got the freshly squeezed OJ and it was great. I also ordered the French Toast. It sounded interesting as they use sourdough. Weird, right? It was weird. Not a fan of the sourness going through it. But it was nicely griddled and the syrup and delicious scoop of whipped butter helped. The eggs and bacon( a bit skimpy tho) on the side were very good, as were the hashbrowns I ordered on the side.  Hubs had the Popeye omelet, and my bite was very tasty.  All in all, a good place to go, but they really need to fix that sewer problemo.",

The food was all prepared fresh (even the biscuit and the jam that came with it!). I think it is also worth mentioning that when they say they have fresh-squeezed orange juice they MEAN IT (unlike some other places I've been...).  Not only was the food fresh and delicious, the service was excellent.  Despite the fact we arrived right at peak hours and the place was packed, the service did not suffer.  As if all of that wasn't enough motivation to come back, when I got the bill I was blown away. The prices are VERY reasonable especially for the quality of food you receive. This is our new breakfast spot and I would highly recommend it to anyone.",

    "text": "I have delayed writing this review for a short time now. I usually do not like to give less than a three star rating to a place on a review. And this review is not for a lack of try on their part.   The place is always busy on the weekends so I decided to give it a try. I like a good breakfast place. So busy should be a good sign right? A wait of 15 minutes or so is common so be prepared. I do have to say that the wait staff (no pun intended) was fantastic. Very friendly and attentive. Just very busy and that is understandable.   The coffee was hot and our server kept our cups filled the best she could, but you don't just go for a cup of coffee right? The \"fresh squeezed\" orange juice was good. Not to pulpy. This is where my experience went downhill. I ordered just a ham and cheese omelet after letting the server know of my mushroom allergy. She even wrote it on the ticket to make sure the cook knew. Well to my surprise I had mushrooms in my omelet. I asked to speak to a manager to get it straightened out but they never came over to our table. 25 minutes and no manager. Too busy I guess. No, I did not get the order redone and I did not order another dish. I was too afraid of cross contamination. I ate my toast, paid my bill for the omelet I didn't/couldn't eat and left.   Sorry Original Breakfast House, first impressions are lasting. I'd love to try the place again but definitely not on a weekend morning. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt because it was packed but to serve an ingredient in a dish that the patron is allergic to is uncalled for from a kitchen staff.",

They left out couple ingredients. The guac was old. The chorizo was good mine was tasty the service was great . I don't let the quality of the food interfere with the service which is why we tipped. Also BIG issue which why we gave 3 stars was because of hygiene.  They never used gloves. The owner kept walking in the kitchen and helping out with ready to eat food but no gloves ? I mean that's gross. The servers and boh staff needed hair nets and the waitresses had their hair all messy. Also the girls soon fresh orange juice. Same , no gloves , It wasn't nice to look at .. That was the main reason why I gave 3 stars they need to work on their hygiene a lot . Hopefully they change it because it might affect their business regardless of the food is great",

A perfected version of the fried french toast he introduced us to in Monterey.  The Huevos Rancheros were excellent and the El Paso Omelette was spot on.

Nothing like being waited on by an owner.   They have fresh squeezed orange juice (a must in my opinion) organic (!) for $2.95, and it comes with a free refill! We got the Popeye Omelette, which had spinach, mushrooms, and bacon, and was very tasty. The potatoes that came with it tasted like they had been soaked in water a little too long. We also ordered the pancakes and paid the $1 extra for a good sized portion of real Vermont maple syrup, which was totally worth it. The pancakes were delicious, light and fluffy, with a hint of lemon. Next time I'm going to try the raspberry chocolate chip pancakes.   I love the building, it's very bright and cheery. The ambiance and decorations are great and the bathroom is very nice too. Overall, I'm extremely satisfied and I can't wait to take friends and family back here!   The bill came out to about $20, which is more than reasonable for the fantastic food and great service. They put an emphasis on cafe free eggs, organic milk, locally sourced breads and jams, and fair trade coffee. My kind of place! My search for breakfast places is over, and I'll be coming back here weekly! :-)",

The potatoes were nice and crispy and the omelette had some chorizo and black beans in it. The meal overall was flavorful and I enjoyed it very much. I will definitely be back to try other items from the menu. The service as well was very attentive and nice.",

    "text": "The Original Breakfast House is one of the best surprises in N. Phoenix!  We have been coming here practically since it opened.  We usually go to OBH on Sundays after church and there is always somewhat of a wait because people have discovered what a wonderful place this is!  The employees are so efficient and the owner, John, is so friendly and and knows what he is doing, so the wait usually ends up being shorter than what you'd expect!  We went to OBH on Sunday, March 12th and had a new server we had never met before!  Her name was Teresa and she was one of the sweetest,  most attentive and accommodating servers we've ever had!  Her sincerity, smile, and knowledge of the menu specials was amazing!  We will ask for her in the future!  And, don't forget the food!  It is amazing!  We have never been disappointed in anything we've ordered here!  They always have delicious creative specials, but, the regular selection on the menu is also outstanding and we have a tough time choosing as there are so many wonderful choices!  Favorites include the cinnamon rolls, many egg dishes, various pancakes and my husband's favorite, the Monte Cristo with plenty of homemade strawberry jam on the side!  The pictures of John's history in the restaurant business is proudly displayed on the wall inside the door and a sign proudly states, \"This ain't my first rodeo\"!  Right now the restaurant is decorated with baseball team banners for the Spring Training season in Phoenix!  We highly recommend OBH for breakfast or lunch!",

    "text": "Tried to come here a couple weeks ago, saw the reviews, however wait was too long, so decided to give it another shot today.  Went around 12:45 and there was no wait!  So either go really early or later.   Wanted to try so many things on the menu and couldn't make a decision. The waitress, Kimberly was absolutely so sweet and helpful! She was very patient.   We had the ribeye steak and scrambled eggs - there's different options for sides, I went with pancakes and crispy hash! Usually I have to ask for the hash browns to be done crispy but this place had it perfect! The pancake has a sweet lemon flavor to it. I couldn't figure it out, but it clearly states that on the menu.   We also had the French toast special which came with bacon and eggs. The sourdough French toast was also flavored with lemon zest, vanilla, and cinnamon! It was dipped and deep fried. Never had French toast like this before! It was amazing!!!  I didn't have the fresh squeezed orange juice but my company told me it taste so good and never had OJ that good and fresh before!  Now... I wish I could give this place 5 stars, but I was a little disappointed with the restroom. There was one restroom for each sex and it was a little unkept. I understand it may have been the end of the day for them since the place closes at 2pm and probably the brunch rush, however they could at least have more than one stall for a restaurant of that size!   The decor and furniture are a little dated but at least it wasn't dirty.  We will definitely be returning to try other items on the menu!",

I ask for it on the side, so my chicken stays crispy and not soggy. I also get a side of hash brown just because. Servings are HUGE here, I always have left-overs. No complaints about this spot, I am def a fan though and will return when I am around the area. The servers I have encountered have been nice and food comes out timely!

I ordered the French toast special, and wanted to try the strawberry flavor but was told it would be $2 extra. No thanks. So I got the original kind with 2 eggs and substituted hash browns instead of bacon/sausage. The latter two items were all right, nothing to rave about. I thought the French toast would be amazing since they use sourdough bread and add orange zest and vanilla, but it turned out to be too heavy and not very good.  I'd rather go to Village Inn, they've got a great V.I.B special (choose 4 items for $7).",

The owner is a vet so he gets the sacrifice that military men and women make to serve our country. I would give them 5 stars for that alone, but honestly I am just giving them 5 stars for the chicken fried chicken and French toast. This is fried french toast and chicken with gravy on it so if you're on a diet, it's probably not for you. If you like to indulge every once in a while though, this is the way to do it. Everything was delicious. OJ was legit, fresh squeezed. Service was awesome. I really have nothing bad to say about this place.",

The 2 things that stick out for me... the French Toast and the Pancakes. The Pancakes have a lemon zest of some sort added and it's great. It's what separates these pancakes from others. It's not overwhelming, it's subtle so enjoy it.   Expect a wait during peak morning hours but the complimentary water and outdoor waiting area helps. With the fall approaching, the sun won't be so bad like it is during the summer hours when waiting and if your going solo, head inside and look for an open spot at the bar tables to the right.",

    "text": "Me and my wife where running late on a wed getting to the place at 1pm. We where the last people seated before they lock the doors to incoming customers for the day. I personally haven't had a German pancake AKA a Dutch Baby since I was a boy. Over 20 years ago . Needlees to say that's all I really came for. So 15 min later after ordering the freaking awesomely delicious strawberry lemonade and my wife hemming and hawing over the menu she ordered a 2.50 can of Pepsi. (Yes per can) they have no soda fountain. My wife ordered tandy I attempted to order a Dutch baby but was told no. That it was to late. The waitress put in the wife's order n honestly I was done. We decided if the only reason I came there was for something I could not have we might as well go to a lunch place and get something else besides a breakfast at 1:30pm.  Well as fate would have it as me n the wife got up it seemed as if all the staff took notice . The very caring hostess at the register asked why we where leaving without eating. I politely told her that I'd been up since 5am craving a German pancake from my childhood but for various reasons I was withheld all morning and decided to just get lunch. She instantly looked at the clock quizzically and got the attention of a man named Ron and explained that we had been here for 15 minutes and no one said anything about not having a Dutch baby available. She asked him politely if he'd be willing to make me one. Ron didnt hesitate for a second. Saying \"yeah of course just let me finish here\" hesaid a few words to the women he was talking to and went off to the kitchen. Well @ that point there was no way I I could leave. Not only for the fact I was getting what I wanted but just for the fact that I haven't been treated that well in any establishment in years. I mean honestly I didnt complain at all . I  felt let down n frustrated but they weren't the reason I arrived so late. I didnt ask to speak to a manager or anything and these people just instinctively had the best service. I have complained at other places for real issues. I have no problem doing so when there's a real problem. More often than not most places still handle issue poorly if at all. I just want to say thank you to Ron the GM n cook apparently. Also the hostess who's name I sadly did not get. You guys made me and my wife feel valued. Thank you so very much.  That makes the cost of a $2.50 12oz can of Pepsi almost tolerable. LoL",

I had heard good things of the Original Breakfast House from many reliable sources and made a little time for a bite. I love the beach theme throughout the restaurant. The owner has his roots from California and renovated this place in 2011 after he moved to Phoenix. The staff was super friendly. OBH takes a modern twist on classic diner food and is known for their deep fried French toast. Some other items include linguica (smoke cured pork sausage), chicken fried streak, carnitas and Spam. I couldn't resist the desire to try their pork green chili omelette. The portion sizes are pretty large and my omelette was pretty loaded with pork, cheese and sauce that almost covered the entire entree. Their breakfast potatoes are nice and flavorful. Even though I didn't order any, my eyes were drawn to the pastry display where I saw some delicious looking homemade pop tarts. This is a great addition to the West Valley and I had a nice experience. Just a heads up - they only accept cash.",

I ordered then scrambled well and what I got were hard slightly burnt eggs. If she ever checked on us after we got to taste the food I would have told her this issue, but next time she came by was to drop the check and leave. I usually agree with all yelp reviews but this place didn't live up to the 4.5 stars! Overall the food was 3 stars and the service was 2 because the girls at check out are amazing!

I can't believe I haven't tried it sooner. The owner was even going table to table to check on all of the service. I love this is a local establishment and not one of those big chains.

    "text": "Our family loves to go out every Sunday for breakfast and we were excited to try this new breakfast joint.  However the dishes we ordered were terrible.  I ordered bacon and cheddar omelet.  It had a big cheese golf ball size glob in the middle and the omelet was quite brown/ well done on the outside.  Another reviewer raved about the hash browns. Mine was the size of the omelet but old and soggy greasy.  However the pancake was edible and I liked the lemon hint.  ( My husband and son tried it and did not like it.)  Both my husband and son ordered the country fried steak. It was not crispy and the thick, clumpy gravy had too much grease.  I had encouraged them to get the hashbrowns and they felt the same way.  The waitress took our order, brought our drinks and then the check.  She never checked back to see how we liked the food.  I did tell the hostess when we were leaving when she asked.  She had no comment.  The ToGo box was top quality and held our mound of food quite well for our dogs.  Not a good idea because they got sick too.  What a bad experience for $39!    Loved that the owner supports using locally grown food!",

Manager did come over but then my guests had finished their meal. He wanted to replace it and I said no thank you we had to go.  I did not eat. He still brought over a small plate of Biscuits and gravy. Nice and hot.  Was good.   Why a kitchen person or manager can not get this right the first time beats me.    I did not ask for it to be taken off the bill and it was not.   Customer Service - bad.  Could give a 2 start but it worth you trying.  I just wont be back.",

The only thing I'll write that's close to a complaint was about my pancakes.   They charge an extra $1 for strawberry topping, but when the plate arrived, there were only about three [strawberries] on the plate. A nice gentlemen (the owner maybe?) ended up getting me almost a bowl full to make up for it. Kudos to him. Oh!! Also be prepared for a little bit of a wait. Took about 20 mins, but it was worth the wait.   Bonus 10 points: Our waitress chased us out to the parking lot when she discovered an item was missing from our extra to-go order was missing.   Bonus 5 points: All the other patrons were really nice folks. This was definitely a \"family friendly\" atmosphere.",

So much beautiful breakfast food.  I ordered the big gooy something. I could not remember what I ordered because I was so busy looking at everyone else's plate. Are they super sized? So much food!   Then- the magical moment- our food arrives at the table! My plate was overflowing with eggs, cheese, mushrooms, onion and potatoes. I did not even get to finish it because there was so much deliciousness!   Took home leftovers and had it again for dinner.   By the way, the servers are fabulous!

When we arrived they were also having a car show in the parking lot and parking was very difficult, almost left, but we ended up parking across the street. Place was packed which in my eyes is a good sign, after about a thirty min wait for a party of three we were seated.  My wife and I got menus and our five year old got nothing, I do not believe they have a kids menu. My wife got the El Paso omelette. The serving size is huge and on top of that it comes with hash browns and two pancakes! My daughter got the pancake special and she absolutely loved it. I ended up going with Juan's tacos and I highly recommend it. Price per person was under $10, and portion sizes were awesome.   Place is relatively small but you have enough room to enjoy your meal and your company, with the lack of size it can be a tad bit noisy but don't let that keep you away. Great experience and great food we will definitely be going back soon!",

I looked at my watch just out of curiosity to see how long it would take when this place was clearly packed. 12 minutes later our food was brought out. Both meals were on point and devoured quickly. Just as soon as we were done the check was dropped off. The quickness of this staff was very out of the ordinary and we appreciated it. We will be back no doubt.

I get down there and they don't have that though, it's a special that changed. They did have a creamed beef on toast so I got that and a side of ham steak. The ham steak was good but wow the cream beef was sooo over seasoned. It was so strong with garlic and spice it was making me sick and my gf couldn't even eat hers at all. I was highly disappointed from the reviews and the manager(young lady) was marketing me since she knew I came from yelp, which was odd. On a lighter note they had a charity bin and you could donate clothes which is good to know!!",

Immediately upon walking in we were greeted, seated and our Waitress (shoot I don't remember her name.), informed us of what she enjoys and it was very helpful for me since it's limited to what I can have for breakfast, since I don't eat pork.  I had their chilaquiles with a green chili sauce and eggs. Although, I liked it; I am so wishing I had Heath's deep fried french toast with triple berry!! Say what?!?! Deep fried french toast? Yes, you heard that right and that's what they served. I didn't believe it until it was in my mouth and I was like I should have ordered that! Trust me it wasn't easy getting him to share a bite. I'm like, \"seriously you aren't going to share?\" (Stink face - directed towards him in a playful way of course.) HAHA! But finally he shared and not just with me but with our other friends at the table! Shocking! ;)   Anyways, you MUST get this fabulous breakfast treat and they also have fretted squeezed orange juice. I believe the gentleman owner went around asking how everything was and I was impressed with that. This place is busy and from what I have heard it's new? I foresee this place being a success for a long time to come. It's a great sign when they are very busy with a lot of customers.  OBH is clean, cute, friendly, attentive and yummy. Our friends ordered the breakfast pork tacos and they very much enjoyed it.  A great touch is the entire coffee container that is left at your table for refills.    I'm saying goodbye to the breakfast joint at 40th Street and hello OBH since dining here. :)",

I can't begin to describe what it taste like but if you are against sweet flavors then you need to skip over this glorious option and choose something else off the menu. This is no ordinary french toast. It's fried, weird looking but delicious , did I mention massive? 1 slice would do just fine and that says a lot coming from me because I love to eat. Apple Juice is fresh with the little brown stuff settling at the bottom of your cup. Hashbrowns are great. Omelette is great! Service was phenomenal (they even walk around sometimes serving free baked goods). I've tried this place a few times and it has never failed me once, best breakfast place I've ran into in Phoenix.",

We walked in and immediately we saw the cash register, glass case of baked goods, and surf boards all over. We were greeted by multiple friendly employees. Right away our server came over and got our drink order. The coffee was quite good. She gave us a few minutes to read the menu and answered all of our questions. She took our order and the food didn't take all that long to arrive. Our food was all hot - which is an absolute must for multiple people at our table. We had Tres Leches pancakes (special), chicken fried steak/chicken, and some other combo. Their pancakes were so good, loved the hint of lemon in the pancakes!!! The French toast rocked!! Loved the delicious donut-y texture!!  It was interesting having to pay cash since we sooo aren't used to it these days, however I kind of liked it and they have an atm so as to not inconvenience their customers.

I ordered the huevos rancheros and the SO had scrambledeggs+fruit+biscuit. The huevos were really, really delicious to begin with - the bean/egg combo were ace. The tortilla underneath was a bit too hard and crispy for my liking. As I was eating everything though...i started to feel a bit nauseous. I'm not sure if it was the green chile...my body, or what. I don't usually have a sensitive stomach but it did not sit too well at all. I was nauseous for awhile.  The SO's plate was basic and ordinary. She said the biscuit was underwhelming for house made.  Not a whole lot of vegetarian options but I read that they're able to make a tofu scramble/veg subs. Very nice to feel accommodated.   Our server was very friendly and accommodating. The setting was welcoming and homey. Maybe we'll give this place another shot, maybe not. Glad I did finally get to try it. Sad my stomach didn't enjoy what I put in it.",

While it was packed and crazy busy, the service staff was bustling, smiling, and never made us feel rushed. My husband's dish was far tastier than mine (he won this round!), but mine was also delicious. I'm not kidding when I agree with most of the reviews here that the chicken fried chicken is amazing! I wish that it had been on my plate! This place made my bookmarks because it was on one of those \"best breakfast in Phoenix\" type of lists that I once read, and I love breakfast! Unfortunately, this place is about 45 minutes from my home, so it took me a long time to get around to it. If I were anywhere near here, I'd go back again. **This establishment only takes CASH.",

    "text": "If you're looking for a laid back, California vibe with an awesome breakfast menu, this is your place.  It's cash only (they do a no fee ATM if you forget), but don't let that hold you back. We came at a 8:30 on a Friday during Spring Training and had no wait. By 9:30 there was a line.   Service was perfect! I judge breakfast places on how tasty and fluffy the scrambled eggs are , the crispiness of the bacon ordered \"extra crispy\" , the taste of the coffee- fresh not burnt in any way, and the hashbrowns .  Everything we ordered hit the spot!  The homemade pop tart was fun for my daughter (too sweet for me), but it was the most beautiful pop tart I've seen. The pancakes were superb- the other reviewers did not lie. Oh- and I appreciated the selection of coffee creamers - for St. Patty's weekend to see Irish creamer was pretty cool. Speaking of cool, the creamers come in a bowl so you get a nice variety of chilled creamers.    We liked the Jimmy Hendrix vibe & layout of the restaurant. Clean bathrooms were a plus. This was a fun place for kids. The kiddos at the table next to us had the most beautiful hot cocoa we've seen! Mounds of whipped cream and chocolate drizzle. Ah and the pecan pancakes did not disappoint. If you're visiting from out of town, definitely hit this up.",

Get a cup of iced coffee and take a seat in the huge outside waiting area...the wait goes by quick.  This is the only place in Phoenix that I have found creamed chipped beef. Yes...I am a HUGE fan of the SOS...unfortunately the beef is more of a beef salami (?) but it's still delicious nonetheless. And the toast that it's on...oh em gee!! Thick sliced sourdough. I'm in love. My favorite thing about this dish? No eggs (I am the only person I know who doesn't like eggs!!) but if that's what you prefer, you can get a side.  Now let's move on to the french toast. I like mine with strawberries and whipped cream, which they definitely serve. The best part? It's deep fried!! I think this is my new favorite. I am more a sweet breakfast person than a savory and this hits the spot.  I wake up craving breakfast from here. The staff is friendly, the menu is pretty extensive, the coffee is great (local!), and they have a delicious looking pastry case, even though I have yet to try something from it. Maybe the next trip.  Be prepared with cash, no cards accepted. If you don't have cash on hand, there are a couple free ATMs inside. The one by the door gets a little crowded so use the one by the bathroom.  Happy eating!",

The French toast sold me as it had a sweet taste only this place has offered. Cannot wait to come back for more of their menu. The staff was great, friendly and super attentive. Cash Only place, so glad I researched a bit. We came in on a Thursday morning it wasn't super busy but definitely people there. Also tried their poptarts and cinnamon roll.",

You would think the oranges had just been picked with has delicious as it is. For breakfast we had El Paso omelette and banana split waffle. The El Paso omelette gives you all you need- perfect eggs, bite and flavor from chorizo, freshness from the pico, sour cream, and guacamole. The banana split waffle was just the right amount of sweet. There was a little chocolate and whip cream on it, but the fresh strawberries and bananas provided the contrast to keep it fresh and balanced. I highly recommend this place!",

Well, I didn't end up here just to go to Original Breakfast House, but I give you permission to quote mine me, John.   The French Toast is fantastic. It's not just a slice of bread; it's thick and softens when it absorbs moisture, but not too soft. It gives me a new standard to judge French toast on. The chicken fried chicken is also delicious. Crispy on the outside, but tender and hot on the inside. Gravy complemented the meat without being too salty.   The big gooey scramble someone else ordered felt a tad dry, but otherwise great. Personally, I would prefer a little less potato and a little more pepper with salsa or something.",

My kids ordered pancakes off the kids menu and our waitress informed us that they could add toppings similar to the adult menu pancakes for only $1 more. I had the chilaquiles and they were oh-so delicious. Order something with their green chile sauce. YUM!! Can't wait to come back!",

As I visited OBH, this was my first visit; upon entry I noticed how welcoming not only the atmosphere was but how genuine and friendly the staff was.  There were three other groups of people that entered the same time I did, they called each person by name; bantered with the children as well as each adults with real conversation.

Chicken-fried chicken slathered in gravy is amazing enough, but then you stick it between a gigantic French toast on the left and eggs on the right and you begin regretting your life decisions in the best way. I do not even want to know how many calories were involved. Husband also said his biscuits and gravy were the best he'd had, and he's somewhat of a connoisseur.   I mostly had eyes for the aforementioned chicken dish, but their menu is big and broad enough to suit a range of tastes--the usual breakfast fare with a few oddities and special baked goods. They even make homemade pop tarts!   Note: this is a cash-only place, though they are kind enough to provide a free ATM onsite. You'll also probably wait in line for 15-20 minutes on a Sunday morning (we arrived a little after 9) but stick with it. They move through pretty quickly, which is impressive given how many people they cram into the building at any given time. It was aaaaallllmost too much for this claustrophobe to handle. Average price per-person is around $12-13, not including a coffee carafe or fresh-squeezed OJ.  Would happily return a million times over.",

    "text": "Chicken fried chicken. That is all.  Honestly, pancakes and french toasts are my go-to's when we head to any breakfast place but for some reason, I wasn't really feeling that this past Friday (I think I was really craving some protein after all the desserts we had the night before).  Anyway, we made the drive out with my in-laws on Black Friday, fully prepared to wait an hour for a table but to my surprise, got seated immediately (at a booth, might I add).  Opening their menu, you are spoilt for choice. You've got tons of options for pancakes, french toast, waffles, omelettes, scrambled eggs, coffee (regular, cold brew, horchata, dirty chai), tea, freshly squeezed orange juice, everything. Their omelettes and scrambles come with your choice of two sides (hash browns, home fries, fruit, pancakes, toast, biscuit) while the pancakes and french toasts have the option to add eggs and bacon for an extra charge ($3.75, I believe). And not forgetting the chicken fried chicken that comes with eggs, a deep fried french toast (which is very reminiscent of funnel cake), and hash browns.  The husband got the chicken tinga omelette and though I wasn't blown away, I did really enjoy the hash browns and oh those, pancakes. I love the hint of lemon in their pancakes! Just a touch of freshness amidst the sea of maple syrup (that's how I like my pancakes FYI, just drowning in syrup - don't judge me). My chicken fried chicken was delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed the gravy on the fried chicken, my eggs were done perfectly, and the deep fried french toast was such a treat! Hands down, I'm ordering it next time we head over to OBH.  All in all, great experience, delicious food (and satisfying too), and I can't wait to try more items on their menu! I need multiple stomachs, so I can still order their chicken fried chicken.",

They do have 2 arms that are fee free inside. They never rush you, however they do have a sign posted asking that no business meetings take place during rush hours.  It's usually busy and on weekends plan on waiting. This is probably our favorite breakfast place. They serve only breakfast and lunch.  You owe it to yourself to try this restaurant.",

They have a covered waiting area and grass that the kiddos like to run through. They even offer complimentary bottled water for the guests while you wait. Can't get much better than that!",

I drove right by it even when I knew where it was. The front is facing the parking lot and the side is facing 32nd street.   Walked in and it seemed very casual. The decor is hard to describe. I would have to say homie. Staff is homie wearing normal clothes and nothing to separate them from customer. Unique. Anyways, we were greeted right away, seated with a smile, and our waitress welcomed us right away. Very nice.   We started off with their freshly squeezed orange juice. Room temperature with the pulp. Really good. Loved it. You also get one free refill. Make sure you get the refill.   I realized that all these breakfast joints are all the same but what separates the good one from the great ones is their pancakes and French toast. Couldn't figure out which one to get today so I ordered the pancake special with blueberry pancakes, eggs, and sausage. I got two huge pancakes with blueberries inside and on top with maple syrup. Excellent pancakes. Nice fluffy. Really tasty with fresh blueberry. Couldn't ask for more. The eggs were good and the sausages thick and juicy. Really good breakfast.   My son had the Hog Heaven omelette. It had sausage, bacon, and ham with cheddar cheese. Very surprised he ordered a omelette but then again it had bacon and he loves bacon. He told me that it was really good. He's a very picky eater so when he says it's good then it must be really good.   Service was excellent. They already have a small jar of cold water at the table so you don't have to worry about refills. Only have to worry about orange juice refills which is a must. She was always asking us how are food was and kept an eye on us which was really good.   So overall this was really good. Excellent food, excellent service, and homie atmosphere. What else could you ask for. For sure I'll be back again to try their San Francisco style French Toast. Enjoy.",

    "text": "It's twenty minutes after 6:00am. Several cars wait expectantly in the lot beneath a waking Arizona sky. Plump clouds hover uncharacteristically low, nearly kissing the horizon. Behind them, the sun creeps vertically on its course.  It's 6:35am. Warm light cuts across a long, narrow bar. Casts exaggerated shadows. Dims for a moment. Regains its strength. The sky adjusts through lighter and lighter shades of blue outside the window opening eastward to the right.  You are alone except for the clinking sounds of silverware and glass, the padding of energetic feet on pinched carpet, the undulating hum of conversation. You are alone except for the notepad to your right, a pen, your keys, a glass of water.  Later, you will walk back to your car. The hours will embrace you, they will lead you into alternating plans. You will sit at another bar and place yourself again beneath the lilting rays of sun. You'll revisit yourself here and softly watch.  FIRST IMPRESSIONS.  I was one of several patrons to arrive at the Original Breakfast House prior to opening today. I was both surprised and impressed by this: it spoke volumes about the business before I ever stepped foot inside the door.  Upon entering, I was immediately greeted by Brittany. Brittany was very impressive to me because I know how challenging it can be to open the doors of a business to a throng of waiting customers.  Despite being busy right out-the-gate, Brittany was cheerful and accommodating. She gave me my choice of seating and made a point to check back in with me throughout the course of my (long) stay.  Later, I overheard her telling someone that she chose to come in to work today despite the fact that her family was visiting from out of town. She said this without a twinge of irritation or unkindness in her tone.  ABOUT THE SERVICE.  Once seated, I was handed over to Emily, who was equally cheerful despite the early hour. Watching her, I couldn't help but notice how relentlessly she smiled. Her whole essence was bright and kind and genuine - weightless even.  Emily was happy to help me choose my meal, assuring me that she's worked at OBH for a very long time and has tried just about everything on the menu. We settled on a Caprese Omelet from the specials menu with home fries and a side of wheat toast.  I also ordered a fresh-pressed orange juice and a coffee. Emily informed me that all their bread was supplied by the Arizona Bread Company. She told me that the orange juice included a free refill and even (later) offered to let me take it to-go.  The coffee was brewed fresh while I watched and poured in front of me, then the entire pot was left for me to finish at my leisure. A sign at the front-of-house told me that the coffee served here comes from Cortez, a local roaster out of Tempe.  LET'S TALK FOOD.  Honestly, everything was delicious. The omelet, featuring melted mozzarella, plump cuts of heirloom tomato, and huge, FRESH basil leaves with a touch of balsamic, was DELICIOUS: cooked through and flavorful without being overdone.  Even the home fries were a home run: easily the best home fries I've experienced in Arizona to-date. The wheat toast was thick-cut, toasty on the outside and soft on the inside. It was outstanding, too.  Emily also had me try the pepper sauce, which she noted as a specialty of theirs. It was EASILY the most flavorful hot sauce I've ever consumed. In hindsight, I should have asked to buy a bottle... Dang.  The orange juice was spectacular. I literally watched Brittany cut, prep, and press a fresh batch from real oranges. Pulpy and flavorful, I would drive all the way to OBH just for this - no lie.  CONCLUSION.  I decided to visit the Original Breakfast House based on the overwhelmingly positive feedback I found on Yelp. I was NOT disappointed. Despite being pretty far out of my way, I would visit OBH again. In fact, I look forward to it.  If you haven't been, I'd rate it one of the better breakfast stops in the valley and strongly encourage you to find an excuse to go. Next time I'll bring friends. **A very, very easy 5 stars.  A NOTE TO THE STAFF.  Emily and Brittany - thank you for taking such good care of me this morning. I'm used to being the only one with any pep in my step at that time of day, but there you were, right on pace. Both of you were wonderful. THANK you.  OBH owners - well done. I couldn't have been more pleased with my stay at your establishment this morning. I WILL be back, and I hope you get a few extra visits based on this review. You've earned it. CHEERS.  :)",

And even though I'm a vegetarian, John (the owner/operator) has great options on the menu, and based upon feedback is changing to vegetarian beans and rice (instead of using chicken stock).   Love the fact that, even though he's a successful long term restaurateur, he's open to suggestion from his customers.   With all of the above, he's got a winning combination.   My very fave breakfast spot!!!",

I would also want to mention they have fresh squeezed orange juice it was very good and totally worth the $3.75.

Maybe I need a brain scan or something because the chicken fried chicken really was a disappointment. It was very dry and on the bland side.  The gravy was delicious, and I think if I were to return, I'd give the chicken fried chicken a swerve and instead opt for the biscuits and some of that yummy gravy.  The banana pecan French toast had excellent flavor, and the center of it was light and fluffy. The edges, however, were extraordinarily tough. (It didn't exactly stop me from eating it because it still tasted nicely, but made it a lot more difficult!)  The waffle and regular French toast were tasty, and the coffee was good and hot.

The restaurant was packed but service was incredibly friendly and quick. I normally have very low expectations for breakfast food. I'm vegetarian, from out of town, and picky when it comes to the first meal of the day. I got the Huevos Rancheros Verde with hash browns and I added queso Fresca. My meal was phenomenal, and I dare say one of (if not) THE best breakfasts I've had in my 22 years. The atmosphere of the restaurant is crowded and energetic, but not overwhelming. Bathrooms are single stall. Outdoor waiting area. Cash only, but they have a no-fee atm in case you forget.",

Well after 45 minutes of waiting for our food and watching the people sat after us and ordered after us receiving their food we just decided to leave. Severely disappointed and do not recommend this place!",

    "text": "Typical breakfast spot. Basic breakfast with some surf-themed touches - hanging surf boards, surf and beach pics, and servers wearing tie dye shirts.   Service was nice. Coffee was strong. Hubby ordered \"The Big Gooey\" which was a scramble with eggs, sausage, onions, mushrooms, and large chunks of potatoes. Huge portion but flavor was lacking a bit. I ordered the French Toast Combo with two eggs and bacon. French toast was two large, crispy, amazing looking pieces of bread. I was hoping for a little more flavor to it, like a hint of vanilla, cinnamon or just something to \"wow\" me.   Because of the great reviews, my husband and I drove 20+ minutes to dine here and also waited outside on their comfy covered patio for a table for about 20-minutes. We both agreed it wasn't worth a drive across town but it was certainly a good, basic breakfast joint.",

    "text": "This place is absolutely AMAZING! Definitely one of the best places to eat in Phoenix! It's very busy & popular but there is comfy seating to wait & it was only 20 min in spite of looking a lot longer due to the crowd. They had a very talented live performer outside to listen to as you waited. Once inside it's mostly a Hawaiian vibe going on & all staff was very friendly, fast & efficient. They know how to get people in & out & do it very well.   The food was the best! We decided on a chorizo burrito & their standard eggs benedict ( they offer 3 different types). The burrito comes wet & was gigantic! Very delicious! What I loved about the eggs benedict was that it was made with prosciutto, which I've now decided ALL eggs benedict should be made with...took it to a whole other level. Chose the hasbrowns with it (which were perfect) but the home fries looked great too (next time). You can also get fruit as a side if you want to keep it healthy. I like to splurge when I eat out.   The whole meal was really perfection & we will definitely be back again. Bring cash, that's all they accept, but have an atm on site if you need it. They serve breakfast & lunch....their breakfast is the best. Don't let the crowd or any wait stop you. It will be worth it!",

The inside of the restaurant reminded me of a mom and pop shop you'd find in Hawaii and it definitely gave me nostalgia.   For food, my boyfriend ordered the lemon curd blueberry pancakes and I had the spam and eggs which also came with banana pecan pancakes (For $9.95, such a great deal). I thought the spam and eggs was just okay - you could never go wrong with spam but the rice wasn't what I expected. On the other hand, the pancakes were delicious. I preferred the banana pecan pancakes over the lemon curd, but it's only because I thought it was too lemon-y.   Our server was absolutely amazing and enthusiastic. I do feel like I ordered the wrong thing and wish I ordered the chicken and french toast or some other sweet dish which seems to be what they're known for. I'm definitely coming back to give it another try.",

We got there around 11:15 on a Sunday, had a 20 minute waited and waited very little but if that time. We didn't realize until we sat down that there's a small bar area that seats about 6-8 people I guess. Be sure to check that out before waiting for a table.   We ordered a glass of fresh pressed OJ, Apple juice and 1 cup of coffee. 1 cup of coffee is 1 pot of coffee by the way. The OJ was sooo good. Apple juice wasn't bad either. For breakfast I ordered the chicken fried chicken special with 1 slice of San Francisco French Toast and 2 scrambled eggs. My partner ordered 3 slices of San Francisco style French toast, a side of chicken sausage, 2 scrambled eggs and hash browns.   Everything taste good but every single thing came out lukewarm, almost cold. Eggs, French toast, everything except for the chicken sausage. We assumed they were waiting for that to cook to bring everything out together. That was a little disappointing and because we waited so long for our food we didn't want to send anything back.   The French toast is tasty, taste just like funnel cake, the had browns were regular and the chicken sausage were pretty good as well. However, they were cut up into little chucks instead of a sausage links, wasn't bad but unexpected.  Original Pancake House is about a 20 min drive from me, not far by I didn't enjoy it enough to go again unless I'm in the area.",

After coming for years, the quality of the food is still outstanding, prices are still reasonable, the service is still extraordinary, and the atmosphere is still fun and inviting.  The fresh-squeezed orange juice is the best.  And even better?  You get your first glass, and 1 free refill of the most amazing OJ - for a crazy reasonable price for fresh squeezed OJ - $4.00 for those two glasses!  Speaking of outstanding service, while we were waiting on a Saturday morning (and be prepared for a wait on any Saturday morning), we saw a party of 3 leave after their great breakfast, and out ran a waitress after them carrying to-go containers of their refill of orange juice!  WHO DOES THAT?  Only OBH, that's who.  Today I had the Green Chile Pork Omelette, wife and son split two amazing items - the Cinnamon Roll Pancakes, and the Big Gooey Mess (potatoes, sausage, onions, mushrooms and cheddar in a HUGE scramble.)  Son tasted the pancakes, and pushed away the little syrup carafe that comes with it, saying \"Mrs. Butterworths, we don't need your help today!\"  Everything was delicious as always.  We even got to be served by one of our favorite servers, Andrea - always on top of things, always pleasant, and always hustling.  She's outstanding.  And of course, John stopped by to check in on us toward the end of our meal.  It's a treat to watch him work the room, AND the kitchen, AND the counter, AND the register... this guy sets the tone for OBH, and looks like he's having a blast doing it.  Hope he never retires, but when he does, his son Nick will be there to carry the torch.  Keep it up guys, you're doing it right - you're doing EVERYTHING right!",

I've never heard of that but I love it! Our waitress was super friendly and the establishment is very family friendly. I ordered the special of Pastrami Hash at the cost of about $14.95. The Pastrami Hash came with fried onions on top that tasted stale. They weren't hot, lacked flavor and were somewhat chewy. The dish came with two pancakes which ended up being more than enough. Aside from the fried onions, everything else was delicious. My friend ordered the French toast and she LOVED it! I definitely recommend this place for a good breakfast.",

    "text": "I was in Phoenix on business, with the two owners of my company.  After eating hotel breakfasts for four mornings straight, I needed something real. I had made the decision to go out on my last day, even if my companion decided not to join me.  Thankfully, I did not have to dine alone. We got to the restaurant around 7:30 am.  While my boss parked the car, I went in to snag a table. I waited all of thirty seconds before a friendly man came to seat me. We had been warned by friends the night before, that it could be an hour wait on the weekends. We must've gotten to the restaurant at the perfect time, because when we were leaving there was a group of people lined up outside that were waiting to get in.  The waitstaff was very good to us. They got our food out quick and made sure to refill our drinks whenever they got low.  The portions were larger than we expected.  My boss ordered more than he could handle.  We split (more in his favor) a cinnamon bun...so yummy. He had the grits and finished those off quickly. He also ordered a huge scrambled mess (not the actual name). He only ate half before he began waving the white flag. I chose the Irish Benedict and it was superb!  If you're in town definitely check this place out. If there's a line, go ahead and wait...it's worth it!",

OBH has pretty good French toast - and they are big!  Downside is if you want the banana pecan or blackberry versions its a $2 upcharge for very small portion of either item added to the top (its not cooked into or thru) - I'd skip that because the toast is the same otherwise.  I'm a chicken friend chicken and eggs guy so with that menu item titled \"FAMOUS\" I had fair expectations and asked for extra gravy.  Gravy makes or breaks it.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and good portion (2) - they Gravy broke it though - very flavorless and kinda pasty (my opinion).  They charge $1.50 for extra gravy (they forgot it in my case and I caught it on the bill and it was corrected).  Portions are large.  Service was ok.  The owner has a great video on the site.  The French toast was good enough I'll be back for that and to give this place another shot.  The orange juice is talked about a lot (and that you get 1 refill).  I really wish the Gravy was better as I stated the Chicken was cooked perfectly...  I might give it another shot (maybe the gravy was missing something that day - however the front desk guy said its their special version).",

I had this incredible fried chicken/french toast combo, and it was incredible. Met up with a friend (we were both visiting Phoenix from out of state) and her two kids, and we ALL loved what we had. Tons of choices, FANTASTIC service (very knowledgeable and friendly server!). Will definitely go back when I'm in Phoenix!",

When we went we got the green chili pork eggs and chicken fried chicken. It's nice because you can substitute any of there specialty pancakes or french toast instead of toast for like $1.50! We tried a piece of there french toast and chocolate chip raspberry pancakes. The food was so amazing! We liked it so much we went back exactly a week later. It was literally some of the best green chili pork I've ever had, so I got the same thing. My boyfriend tried the big messy scramble and the special pancake for the day which was the cinnamon roll pancakes. Omg, all was amazing again! Plus, the coffee was awesome as well! I'm a one cup girl, I think I had 3! This place is our new favorite for sure!  P.s. Ask for the server Seta or Seda (sorry I forgot the spelling) but she also made the experience wonderful. Very nice, attentive, started conversation, and knew everything about the menu. Just our luck we had her the second time we went as well. She's awesome!",

I ordered the banana pecan pancakes & hash browns. He ordered biscuits and gravy. Two glasses of the fresh squeezed OJ, took my second to go and coffee. And a brioche cinnamon roll to go as well. :-) Well...everything was so yummy!  The OJ is like sticking your straw right into an orange. Pancakes & hash browns rocked! That cinnamon roll had sooo many layers, now I get the brioche part. Owner, John, on the floor saying Hi & being the dude. Divina our waitress was so sweet, great smile :-) Great breakfast joint!

As main dish we  had the french toast & scrambled eggs. French toast was fried to perfection, very good. Also tried the chicken fried chicken, very well cooked however it needed a little bit of salt. The kids pancakes aren't that special, they taste like the ones you buy frozen and reheat. Squeezed orange juice was very good. The cinnamon rolls pancakes I didn't like, not quite sure what it was but it wasn't what I was expecting. So if you are craving cinnamon rolls I would recommend going straight to the actual cinnamon rolls which are delicious, huge and a very fair price.  Service was great, everyone was nice & friendly. Prices are a little on the higher end compared to other breakfast places around the area.",

They are very busy on the weekends and you could wait 30-40 minutes for a table.  But once seated, you'll find the wait well worth it.  If You want to avoid the crowds - go for breakfast during the week.  No waiting.     The food is better than most places you'll have breakfast.  While I can't call it gourmet - It's top shelf.  I'm pretty sure most everything is hand made.  Hand dippped vanilla French toast, lightly seasoned breakfast potatoes, and this to die for apple chicken sausage (I crave it when I've been away too long).      Service is always prompt, the food comes out quickly and it tastes divine.  You'll also see the owner here every day - seating people, asking for feedback and just making sure things run smoothly.  Its obvious that he cares and it shows in the staff as well.    I've been here dozens of times and can't think of one bad thing to say - so I figured it was time to write a review.",

    "text": "Extremely disappointed. I came here yesterday morning (6-6-16) after an appointment with my 8 year old. After seeing all of the good reviews, I was excited for a hearty, filling, tasty meal. What I got was a waitress who was more interested in everything BUT us, and a bland meal. We were seated quickly, then proceeded to wait (and wait and wait) as our server chatted with a couple in the booth in front of me. I learned that she has been working there for 2 years, she's from Camas Wa, she recommends the french toast, and a few other things. She was not taking an order, as a matter of fact the couple were slowly trying to inch out of the booth and disengage. Finally she came and asked our drink orders. My son got a root beer and I had a coffee and an orange juice. After about another 6 minutes that came out and was dropped off.   Again, we waited and waited while watching her engage and chat with other customers. It took about 15 more minutes for her to come back to take our orders. We placed them and again waited. After another 10-15 minutes, another woman came and dropped off our food. Our waitress was at another table- yep, chatting.  I cut into my carnitas omelette with green chilis. First bite- dry. Very very dry. And bland. Even salt and pepper weren't helping. I took 3 bites and gave up. The potatoes were okay. My son was very happy with his pancakes at least. Oh, and the OJ was delish. Fresh squeezed and sweet.   Anyways, I decided to ask for a box to take the omelette home to my oldest son (AKA the Garbage Disposal). It took another 10 minutes to get that and the check dropped off. By this point I was so done. I took the receipt to the register and got out of there. My oldest son tasted the omelette and tossed it out. He said it was weird tasting and dry- and that boy is not picky, lol.   A few other issues...There were these itty bitty black bugs crawling in and out of the wood window sill, which was dirty. I smooshed a few with my napkin and showed our waitress. No response. The menu was FILTHY and I had both myself and my son go wash up after reading them. (See pictures) I would not go back, nor recommend, sad to say since it's so close to his Dr office.  Edit:  I had a long drawn out response to the owner, but honestly it's not worth it. The waitress was absent, those were not ants, I know what carnitas is, and that omelette was bad.  Sorry, but it is what it is and this is my review. Maybe instead of trying to negate your lower reviews, you could simply say \"We've reviewed you post and are looking into it\".",

Unfortunately we had to change plans as soon as we arrived due to the restaurant being closed from 7/12-7/21 for vacation. Being closed for this length of time you would think the owner would have made the effort to update their voicemail and website.   Very disappointing after making the drive. As we sat in the car looking for other breakfast options we watched over 20 parties walk away just as disappointed, and that was only within 15 minutes.   Note to owner: next time you want to close for almost 10 days to go on vacation, please at least be courteous enough to your existing and new customers to update your voicemail and website accordingly.",

They serve their ice coffee in a root beer mug that they constantly refill, it turns out to being a lot of coffee throughout the course of the meal. My friend got the lemon custard pancakes and I got their country fried chicken special. The portions here are incredibly generous and I would be surprised if most people could finish all their food. In fact I didn't see anyone around me that did.   There was a bit of confusion when I ordered actually and I thought the fried chicken came with their hashbrowns, which look and smell amazing. I'm glad I didn't get the hashbrowns because I would not have been able to eat them at all.   I would highly recommend Original Breakfast House. Definitely one of the better breakfast diners north of Phoenix!",

We ordered the El Paso omelet (chorizo,beans,peppers,onions), the raspberry chocolate pancakes, and the fried chicken/french toast. Orange juice to drink.  Pros:  Excellent orange juice  Friendly service French toast was delicious  Cons:  Omelette was terrible. Nothing is cooked into the eggs, rather scooped in. This caused a soggy omelette. Chorizo seemed like seasoned ground beef. Proportions of filling to egg was completely off. My guess is canned beans and peppers. I would have sent it back if the waitress had come by.   Pancakes looked great in the menu but did not live up to the picture. Not fluffy nor flavorful.   Fried chicken was chewy. Flavor was not bad but it was tough.   I really wanted to love this place as so many have before. I don't know if they were having an off morning or if this is standard.",

The people were very friendly and helpful on assuring everything was right.  We shared the San Francisco Style French Toast, Banana Pecan Pancakes which we ordered with Eggs and Sausage or Bacon. We also had the Hash Browns.  The French Toast was a San Francisco Sour Dough Bread and prepared very well. It taste better than it looks :)  The Banana Pecan Pancakes are fluffy and soft but very filling. The have a very good taste and a touch of lemon.  The Hash Browns are prepared just right with a outer crisp that I like.  The restaurant it's self is not in a great area and the building is not new skills don't expect like a Scottsdale Style Foo Foo Restaurant because it is not going to be here.  Come for the food, will come back to try other items maybe some of the Mexican Breakfast Dishes",

I had eaten here twice before, the first time I had steak and eggs along with a great fresh orange juice,  Best I've had in years.  On my second visit I ordered chipped beef which was the worst thing I've had in a very long time,  Beef was runny and I think hamburger, potatoes were old and cold but the juice was still great,  So today I decided to take my wife who is a steak and eggs lover.  I had shared with her how great my experience was eating here and wanted her to give it a try,   What a mistake!  THe steak was ordered medium rare and came out dry, old and cold as if it had been sitting on the grill for hours,  The hash browns on both our plates tasted of old oil. not quite rancid but close.  She could not believe that I thought this was good and had the nerve to bring her here,  Since this was the second time out of three experiences that were terrible, I assured her that this would be our last.  It is unfortunate since I had such great hope in the beginning.    Note:  I had written two other reviews about The Original Breakfast House but do not see them.  One was very favorable and the other not so much.  Wonder where they went?  Frank",

The other couple was there when we arrived and they had ordered a cinnamon bun. That was the high. This cinnamon bun was good... the frosting was a little tart, possibly cream cheese based... it was delicious. After that, things were just ok. Their coffee was fine ,but nothing special. The OJ, like others have said, is fresh squeezed and comes with a refill, which is generous of them. I had the egg sandwich for breakfast and, unfortunately, it just wasn't that great. It had a ton of bacon on it.... way too much, I had to take at least half off. The rest of the sandwich was lacking in flavor. It came with home fries, which were not very crunchy. The husband had blueberry pancakes, which were alright, but again, nothing special. I would come back here if invited, but I don't think I would drive out here again on my own.",

I've had nearly all of the plates they offer and everything has been excellent. Certain times of year they also open for dinner and have a fish fry that is amazing. Being from Wisconsin I have a hard time finding a really good fish fry here. They even had walleye. My only suggestion is to not go during the really busy times or you'll wait forever. Saturday and Sunday mornings it can get crazy, but you'll know the second you pull up because most of the waiting area is outside.",

We decided to check out this hot spot after seeing the overwhelming positive reviews on Yelp and after watching the video the owner made talking about their vision.   The Positive: unlike some of the other reviews saying this place needs a face lift -I disagree and thought this place was very well thought out, clean and organized. It has a very warm and welcoming feel.   The service.. Our server was Theresa... She was very attentive, and provided excellent service. Five Stars for  world class service go to her.  My wife got the huevos Ranchero -it was her first time ordering this and she said it was good no complaints.   Now for the negative: I ordered two eggs not over easy but med asked for runny yolks with the whites cooked, bacon, hash browns with American cheese melted on top and a biscuit with a side of sourdough toast.   Well no American cheese only cheddar and Jack -86 the browns I will do the Home Fry's.  My eggs were hard fried-no gooey yoke for me to dip my biscuit in, the biscuit tasted dry and grainy, my bacon was very tough like jerky, and the toast was really hard to get through.   Because we came at the end of the shift , we agreed maybe this was just a off moment, and we came in at a time when everyone was gearing up to go home. I get it, and because of that and because of the excellent service we received we will be back by to give this place a second chance.",

However,  Breakfast places have a tendency to be either hit or miss.  Today was my first visit to the Original Breakfast House (OBH) and it was a hit. OBH is cooking up breakfast right. OBH offers creative  unique entree's and old time favorites, and you can substitute or add on to any entree selection.  On my first visit I ordered scramble eggs, homestyle fried potatoes, and a side of pancakes, all were delicious. OBH even serves deep fried French toast which looked delicious, I plan on trying the french toast on my next visit .   In addition to great food OBH has great customer servicr. OBH has an old diner feel with great music. The servers are friendly and seem really concerned that you enjoy your  meal and leave happy and full.   So if your ever in the area, stop by OBH, you won't be disappointed.",

It was definitely good and reminded me of the breakfasts you make at home. The husband had a house special chicken and French toast which he enjoyed, I found the gravy on the chicken a bit bland. The child had a monthly special which was the churro pancakes. It came with a churro chopped up on top. I do like he hint if lemon in their pancakes fo sho. They serve china mist iced tea which always makes me happy. I would definitely come back but I would not wait more than 15 minutes for a table. The servers were super smiley and on top of it!",

I wish the bacon, asparagus, and goat cheese scramble was a regular item. However I understand that they only want to use produce that is in season to make sure it's always perfect. Still... it's sooo good! I don't really understand why people are going so crazy about the cash only thing, you just pay with cash instead of a card, no big deal. The only thing that slowly deters us is the wait when the snowbirds come into town. Our gem of a local breakfast joint has been discovered by all.",

There is often a wait of up to an hour to get a table of the weekends but the wait is always worth it! The food here is definitely the best breakfast I've ever eaten! Every item I've tried on the menu is amazing! The home made bakery items are amazing, the cinnamon rolls beat even Cinnabon! They have an amazing selection of special pancakes, my favorite are the blackberry ones! As much as possible they cook with locally produced crops and meats. Many of their ingredients are also organic. Despite this and the complexity of their recipes they maintain a very affordable menu. They always have a great selection of specials, which always please! Today I am trying the special menu item of chicken mole omelette. They also feature the best hot sauce ever which I purchase regularly to keep stocked in my fridge. I will continue to come here regularly!",

It was packed so there was a wait, but not too long. We were seated and greeted promptly. Overall the service was much better this time.  I ordered scrambled eggs, bacon, fruit and a biscuit. My husband got the big gooey scramble mess (that's actually the name) with pancakes. The food came out really fast.  My breakfast was just okay. The eggs and bacon were fine but the biscuit was kind of plastic tasting. Maybe it was too much bisquick or something. The taste was way off.   The scramble mess was better. And it was huge. The two of us could have easily split that and still had leftovers. The pancakes were good too. Better than last time. Until I got to the raw part in the middle! I get that they are moving fast in the kitchen, but make sure the food is cooked! Strike two on the pancakes at this place!  Maybe third time is the charm? After two experiences that were mixed I don't know how soon we'll go back. If ever.",

My family took me there for Father's Day, and even at 7:05a there was a huge crowd waiting to be seated.  Even if the hostess had said there was a one hour wait (which there wasn't) I would have waited.  This food is that good!  This morning I had the Cinnamon Roll Pancakes...  yummy!  They weren't a normal menu item, so I guess it won't be my new favorite.  Haha!

I don't know, it always frustrates me when I go to get breakfast and I'm craving pancakes and they don't have a normal recipe at all. Don't mess with something that doesn't need to be fixed, ya know?! My boyfriend got some fresh squeezed orange juice. It was more pulp then juice; you will literally be chewing your drink. We scooped out a bunch of pulp just to try and get it down but still soooooo much pulp. Saw that no one else was drinking it so maybe regulars there just know not to order it. Got some eggs medium well and they came out so over easy that I couldn't eat them. Tried mixing it with the hash browns we ordered to get it down, only to find a short light blonde hair wrapped around my fork after taking a slice of hash browns. I have long brown hair so I immediately knew it wasn't mine. Appetite gone and we were pretty much ready to leave anyways. Then to only find out it's cash only. I understand there was a sign but if it's your first time, you're more likely looking at their cool collection of surfboards and not paying attention to it. They have the atm on sight which is convenient but it'd be even more convenient if either the hostess or your server let you know before you order anything. All in all I really feel this is a 2 star place for me but the people were friendly and service was quick so I'm giving a 3.",

I never carry cash and probably won't want to withdraw money just to have breakfast. I had basic ham steak and scrambled eggs. You can't mess that up but the eggs were a bit dry. Coffee was good and service was excellent. You pay at the front.   I returned here with a friend and got the chicken fried chicken covered in sexy white sausage gravy. It needed seasoning but it was good. I had to put some hot sauce on it. For some reason the eggs are really good, I got them medium. My friend got French toast and it was so good, I stole a piece of his!",

The pancakes at first were dynamite but I realized they had a nasty after taste. Like a starch taste. I wouldn't re-order.   The OJ was real good - gotta give credit to that.

I had the big breakfast sandwich which was piled high with delicious ham , cheese, caramelized onion and a scrambled egg on a big tasty bun with a side of fresh fruit .My daughter ordered a lemon scone which was hot and fresh straight from the oven I have never had such a tasty scone in my life. The food was out of this world good I had a taste of my friends pancakes which had a powerful lemon taste to them I'm a big lemon lover so if you aren't the biggest Lemon fan not sure if you would be happy but I sure was. As far as the negatives on why I couldn't give this place a 5 star experience was because they were out of several options & staff was on the slower side and hard to get their attn when in need of things but you can't beat the price and quality of food so I would give it a solid 3.5 stars can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Original Breakfast House Review This place I had first seen open out of the blue.  I have heard of the place when one of the employees came in to my work and talked about it.  I came in about 2 weeks ago about 8:30am on a Wednesday I believe.  Here is my take on it.  Appearance 10/10 The place actually looks quite small from the inside.  However, there were quite a bit of people there even on a weekday morning.  The place looks clean.  No problems  Friendliness 7/10 The crew was great and friendly.  However, I seen a few of them in the back talking to each other.  It can take more than a few moments to get your server's attention in case you needed more syrup or your bill.  Wait Time 9/10 It wasn't bad at all.  We were seated almost immediately.  Our food came between 10-15 after ordering.  Just about normal.  Prices 10/10 The prices were actually quite reasonable!  They even had a deal where they would give you a pancake, egg, and 2 sausages for like 5 bucks.  Cant beat that!  Food 9/10 The food was really good in my opinion.  Their pancakes are quite big and filling.  My dad got two and wasn't able to finish them.  You do get the best value for your money here.  OVERALL 45/50  90% A- This is a real great place for breakfast.  I haven't tried their lunch or their 2 dollar milkshakes on Mondays.  But overall for a first time, I was very satisfied.  It just so happens it is right by my work so it is very convenient. They have only been open for only a month or so but within time, it can only get better!!  I will be back and highly recommend!!",

This location has changed hands so many times over the 10 years I've lived near it, and this is the only place that has stuck, and with as busy as it always is, I don't think they're going anywhere, and I hope they never do!!!!!

    "text": "It's twenty minutes after 9:00am. The parking lot is full. There are no clouds in the Arizona sky. The sun is bright. It's a perfect Phoenix spring day.  It's 9:01am. It's a brief walk to the front door. You open it and go inside. There are people everywhere; some are sitting, some are running around. A sweet young girl asks, \"Do you want to sit at the bar or at a booth?\"  You are not alone, because the restaurant is filled with people.  Later, you walk back to your car. You are full and happy.  FIRST IMPRESSIONS  The Original Breakfast House is just a little shack at Thunderbird and 32nd Street. There was a cute mural. The parking lot was full.  Upon entering, I immediately noticed the \"CASH ONLY\" \"FREE ATM\" & \"PEOPLE LOVE US ON YELP\" signs.  I was greeted with a smile, which was not surprising since that is the hostess's job.  Despite being busy, she found me a seat.  ABOUT THE SERVICE  Once seated, I was handed over to Mike, who was cheerful. Mike recommended the Blackberry Deep Fried French Toast. DELICIOUS!!  I also ordered a fresh-pressed orange juice and a coffee. It was literally THE BEST ORANGE JUICE I've ever had. Mike told me that the orange juice included a free refill, which I took gratefully! The coffee was good.   CONCLUSION  I've said it many times before, but I'll say it again:  You can tell the quality of the owner/management by the way the staff behaves and their customer service ethic. The owner, John Stidham, obviously runs a tight ship.  Everything is provided with GENEROSITY! Extra EVERYTHING!  It's a place that was so easy and delicious that I might make a habit of driving the 20 miles to return.  5/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *There is plenty of parking.  *They only take CASH.   *Free ATM",

My guy and I shared the special of machaca beef benedict with hash browns and the pancake breakfast with eggs bacon and two huge fluffy pancakes with blueberries and lemon compote. Everything was over the top delicious! Service was excellent in a fun California indoor setting. The drawback was the wait about 40 min on a Saturday morning but we were glad we went earlier because at the end of the wait it was getting a bit toasty outside. They did have cold mini water bottles outside and benches which was good. Can't wait to go back as this was our first visit and there were so many good things on the menu we need to be sure to try more!",

The place was clean and bright and the staff was all very friendly and helpful. Everyone had a smile on their face which is something you don't often see. The selection is large, as are the servings. The service was fast but we never felt rushed. I had the ham and cheddar omelette which came with hash browns and pancakes. It was way too much food to eat but I certainly tried. The omelette was loaded with meat and cheese and absolutely delicious. My husband had the chili omelette. It sounds like a strange combination but he loved it. Our son had the bacon and pancakes off the kids meal which was more than enough food for him. We easily could have taken food home but since we errands to run we left it behind. Breakfast for the three of us with beverages was just under $30 and well worth it.  Quick update...it's been two years since I first reviewed this place and I was back there again yesterday and it is just as delicious. Even on a Thursday morning there was a short wait for a table but it's worth it!  Just an FYI, as of 9/1/17 they will be cash only. They did however just put a ATM machine by the entrance for those who show up without cash.",

I didn't make it until today, but Yelp has done it again. Great menu with several delicious options including fresh squeezed orange juice--everything you want in a breakfast spot. I ordered the chicken fried chicken (crispy and delicious) with their famous French toast. Wow, the French toast was sooo good--sweet, crunchy, and delicious. I like that they paired the French toast with the chicken meal because most restaurants make you order French toast separately. Similarly, my wife ordered a spinach omelette, hash browns, and a pancake. Pancake was an included \"bread\" option with no additional charge.   Big attention: READ THIS: bring cash, they are cash only. I was glad we happened to have some on hand because we didn't know this.   Expect a wait during busy times--holidays and weekend mornings, but there's a comfortable shaded waiting area and it's definitely worth the wait.",

    "text": "I'll admit to some healthy skepticism whenever I see a restaurant touting cage free eggs and organic milk and local produce and the like.  Not that I don't love all those things. I do. But I fear it might be like the restaurant with horrible food that people keep going to because the great view. Often we are so focused on doing the right thing with our choices that we might accept a little less in the way of flavor to be socially responsible. Fortunately, my skepticism was totally unwarranted in the case of the Original Breakfast House. It's a gem.  Do try the pancakes. The lemon they add to the batter can be sensed immediately at the table. The taste, the odd mix of buttermilk and lemon, is unique and wonderful.  OBH uses Mrs. Butterworth's syrup, a plus, and offers Vermont maple syrup for just a buck more, a nice option.  The French toast is a treat as well. They use thick cut sourdough bread deep fried in a batter containing hints of orange, cinnamon and vanilla. Fresh raspberries were offered as a special on one of our recent visits.  Two dollar and fifty cent kids meals make OBH a very kid friendly destination. Options include French toast, mini pancakes with bacon and a two egg cheese omelet.  The two youngsters that accompanied us on one of our recent visits loved the choices.  One small disappointment. Sometimes the simplest things present the greatest challenges, in this case serving hot and fresh toast. The sourdough toast served to one in our party was cold and dry. Even homemade strawberry preserves were not enough to make it edible. I guess they should have used the bread to make more delicious French toast. Everything else was so wonderful (did I mention the green chili omelet?) that it did not really matter.  The staff is young, energetic and friendly. I'm not quite a True regular at OBH as of yet, but I'm planning on becoming one.",

My husband and I have found our new breakfast place. Thank you for the delicious breakfast and awesome service. Our waitress had such an infectious smile. You can tell it's a place that cares about its customers as much as its food. Highly recommend!",

When we got there this past weekend, the restaurant was nice enough to set out some ice cold bottled water for everyone waiting since it was already hot so early in the morning.  The food here is great.  And the orange juice is extra sweet.  You also get a free refill with your orange juice.  We asked for ours, but it never came. :P  Regardless, I would recommend the Original Pancake House.  Even the banana / walnut pancakes were delicious.  Sausage and eggs were good too.  Plenty of parking.  Just look for The Rock (Church) and it's in the same shopping mall.",

Sure, I'll walk out to the car and change my baby. It's only 105 out. Then make a trip back to the bathroom to wash my hands and wait for 5 mins for someone else to come out. We won't be back until the babe is potty trained. I refuse to go to restaurants that can't make that small investment for their customers  Edit: I appreciate the owners timely response to my concerns. I did not know the counter in the bathroom was for changing babies, and I am not one to just throw my baby on a counter and change her in a public place. Thank you for clarifying and maybe if you could verbalize that that is the purpose of it to your staff. When I asked the hostess if there was a changing station she said if there was it would be in the bathroom. Thanks for your response!",

Everyone from the hostess to the waitress to the manager checking in tables were friendly and welcoming. And speaking of welcoming- the cinnamon buns and scones in the front case will grab your attention and give you something to look forward to. They looked delicious! We shared the French toast with berries and the Carnitas omelette. Although we were hungry, we could not quite finish our breakfast. The French toast was delicious with plenty of berries. The omelette was filled with tender meat- not spicy at all, but very flavorful. It came with crispy hash browns and toast that we had to leave because we were so full. They serve coffee in a carafe which is a must at a breakfast joint and unlike other places - the coffee was hot.  It's all you want in a breakfast!",

Don't let the crowd outside for the wait detour you from eating here, they get people in so fast we had just a 20 minute wait. And I must say, it was WELL WORTH THE WAIT!  We were greeted by the welcoming owner,  super nice guy. You can tell he really cares  that each and every customer has a great experience. I saw him go from table to table checking on his customers to just say hello and to make sure they were enjoying the food.  Our waitress Brittany was outstanding! Very knowledgeable about the menu, friendly, and on top of things!  Now to the food.....  OMG!!! I have to say, this by far is the best breakfast I have ever had! We ordered the chicken fried chicken with banana pecan French toast, and biscuits and gravy. The chicken is cooked to perfection with a tender juicy breast and delicious crispy crust. Don't skip out on the gravy, it is absolutely delicious! The biscuits are large, buttery and flakey, homemade gravy and sausage that is out of this world!!! The fresh squeezed OJ is so good! You even get 1 free refill, unheard of!  The French toast is to die for! It tastes like bananas foster, make sure to get the Vermont maple syrup, totally awesome! 2 pieces of toast will take up your entire plate! I can't say enough about how delicious this place is! The prices are very reasonable and the portions are huge! We would have easily and happily paid twice what we did for this breakfast, it is THAT good!  They keep it very clean and what a great atmosphere! The place is a buzz with friendly conversation and laughter.  When you eat good food you're happy and my husband and I left here VERY happy. We will come back here any chance we get. It will be one of our \"must haves\" anytime we're in town!",

    "text": "Just ate here for the first time during a Saturday morning breakfast rush. There was a wait list and they were packed with people. The wait to sit was about 20mins with around 12-15 party's a head of us. He said 15-20mins but because of so many people I was expecting to wait at least 30. He obviously knew better than I did. Very impressive. Despite being full and busy our food came out in maybe 10 minutes if that. It was incredibly fast. It was also delicious. My server (who I regrettably can't recall the name of or I would happily share it) (if you read this we were the table with the toddler laughing up a storm at the little fish game on my phone.) recommended the Juan Tacos and she was on the money. She found time to check on us multiple times. As someone who has worked in the restaurant business for almost a decade, I don't think I have ever been more impressed with the efficiency combined with service of a restaurant than I was this morning.  You can have great servers and great managers. This place appears to have both in spades. I can't wait to come back again very soon.",

I had the corned beef hash which was the daily special, and a cinnamon roll, and orange juice, (don't judge me, it was my first time here so I wanted to try everything haha) It was so delicious  The orange juice is freshly squeezed, and you get one free refill. The cinnamon roll, which i shared with a friend, was so fluffy and soft.... mmm. The corned beef hash was soooo good. It was served with choice of toast or biscuit, and I chose a biscuit. It was so fluffy and soft as well.   The service was so awesome,  and the host was so sweet.   My new favorite breakfast place for sure, I'll definitely be back!",

TONS of food, I don't think anyone was able to finish theirs.   Only complaint would probably be that it's $2.50 for coffee. This isn't Starbucks. But everything else is well priced and delicious!",

    "text": "I had just gotten out of doing my nails this past Saturday and was craving brunch. Free Saturdays haven't been on my plate for a while until this year, so I love to enjoy brunch every so often, even if it's alone.  Of all the sort of near-ish brunch places, OBH won out by a mile. It's in a silly, old little strip mall where there's some kind of church and from what other reviews say, Alice Cooper's Teen center. Go figure. But don't let the surroundings fool you- this place really is a gem. It was packed when I got in, but the advantage of dining for one is that you often get seats at the bar without waiting. I sat right down and my waitress was prompt and sweet.   The menu is on the short side, but not lacking in choices- just enough to entertain without overwhelming you. I am a bit disappointed by the lack of brunch cocktails, but not a big deal, there's more time later for debauchery. I'm torn by a few options, but wound up getting the chili cheese omelette and splurge on getting sausage gravy on my biscuit as well. The chili was wonderful, and the omelette crazy fluffy- not too much cheese. Pretty awesome. My fruit was fresh, but honestly the most outstanding thing that day was the sausage gravy. I kid you not, it was creamy and luscious and totally amazing. I'd come back for that sausage gravy! The coffee was... okay. Looking at the reviews on hindsight it almost seems like I should have gotten the orange juice later.   I read the sign on the way out and see that they get locally grown, in season organic produce for their food. Pretty awesome. Next time I'm back (and I will be back for sure) I'm going to strongarm somebody in my party into getting those pancakes. And maybe the french toast, and other carbohydrate laden things that I won't get for myself but will happily nip off of other people's plates.",

They deep fry thick, fluffy bread tossed with vanilla and orange zest and top it with whipped butter, powdered sugar, banana, pecans and syrup. It's mind blowingly decadent. I was sad when it was over.   My husband had the Juan's Tacos which are made with chorizo and cheese. Also fantastic. The tortillas were delicious and the home potatoes were flavorful and crispy.

Original Breakfast House really is a gem that at least for me, was off the beaten path. Exceptionally clean, very friendly staff and their mission statement of only using locally sourced ingredients and cage free eggs made me very happy knowing that I was really supporting my local communities.   Let's get down to the food, one of us had the special of the day, a spinach and bacon quiche with a side of fresh fruit. The quiche filling was phenomenal, the eggs, bacon, spinach and spices were all blended together deliciously and the side of fruit was actually fresh and cut quite well, none of that old crap you get elsewhere.   I had the biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs and a side of hash browns. The biscuits were fresh homemade and fluffy, the gravy thick and creamy!  The only cons were the hash browns, too greasy for me to eat and the crust on the quiche was lacking flavor and slightly undercooked.   This would've been a 4 star review but the exceptionally friendly staff and the fact that it was extremely clean are what pushed this up to 5. Will be coming back to sample other items in the future!",

What I found was a nice place with very friendly people.  What impressed me the most was that my waitress Hayley was very accommodating to my dietary needs.  I'm lactose intolerant, so I need to limit my dairy intake to small portions.  She substituted ham for eggs, and made sure my toast was dry, providing a small cup of jam instead.  She pointed out that the hash browns were fried in butter, making sure that was ok.  I liked the fact that the coffee came in a small insulated carafe so I didn't have to chase Hayley for refills.  The owner John was present, and introduced himself.  It's always nice to meet the proprietor of an establishment, and I appreciated that he welcomed me to his place, and shook my hand.  Lastly at the checkout I spent a couple of minutes talking with Justin, and Courtney.  We were discussing how I found them on Yelp, and they asked if I was going post about them.  I've never reviewed anyone on Yelp before, but they were all so friendly I thought sure why not.  So I took their picture, and if I can figure out where to attach it I will do so.  Overall I'm giving them a 4 out of 5 stars.  In reality I'd say it's more like a 4.5, but there doesn't appear to be a half star option.  I'd give them 5, but hey nobody is perfect.  I figure this way it gives them something to shoot for.  Oh and my apologies if I got anyone's name wrong.  I'm very bad with names.",

    "text": "My husband and I are visiting from NM and were looking for a great local breakfast place. Original Breakfast House only accepts cash, but if you don't come prepared they have an ATM on site. The staff was friendly and seated us right away. I got the two eggs over medium and they were perfectly cooked. The bacon was crispy and their home fries were red potatoes and were ok, some of the pieces were very burnt and they needed more salt. My husband got the pancakes with raspberries and chocolate chips. The raspberries were fresh and the chocolate chips were semi-sweet. The pancakes themselves were plain (the berries and chocolate chips were just placed on top) and had lemon zest, which I usually like, but they were a touch too lemony. My husband and I both think that a sweeter chocolate chip would have been better. If you want real maple syrup they charge a $1 extra, and it comes in a pre-sealed little cup. Overall an ok breakfast, but we will not be returning when there are really great breakfast places in Scottsdale to eat.",

You'd think that a $40 breakfast for 2 would yeild something worth writing home about, and as you can see that's one thing they did get right. Don't waste your time or money, not sure how they made the PHX Top 10 but if the other 9 are anything like this place Im calling Bullshit and demanding a recount. C-ya",

    "text": "This place is a miraculous take on the family dining experience. My family usually picks this spot above all others due to the generous accommodations, consistently great food, and incredible customer service! I have never been disappointed going here, and I see the love and attention to detail rarely seen in most breakfast joints in the city. The waitresses greet you with familiar and warm smiles. The atmosphere is always jostling and lively with conversation and the enticing smells of their specials ranging anywhere between their unique take on dishes close to my heart: Spam and Rice to the San Francisco style French Toast, watering my mouth as I recall my experiences with the taste of Apple Chicken Sausage on the tip of my tongue. Service is on point. Even if the wait on the weekends is 30-40 minues, it's due to the high quality of the food and the anticipation to get in and be seated!   Once you're seated, the menu fits comfortably in your hands. Dishes are prepared very well with a downhome feeling to them with someone always there to ask if you need anything. On the weekdays, it's a little quiet but well worth cultivating the oftentimes relaxing experience with the food in a subdued, yet welcoming restaurant--a kind of openness and hospitality similar to island - style eateries with a California beach twist. A trademark the owner makes sure to indulge. He is always there as a reassuring presence, constantly keeping a vigilant yet efficacious eye on the counters and kitchens, checking with clientele, following up on his employees and flood of patrons with a beaming smile. Every time, he never fails to amaze me in the best way.  Quite frankly, to me, this place bubbles up feelings of welcome no matter how I come into my state of mind for that day: sad, happy, angry, the day gets brighter when I'm here--it's home. That feeling never changes when I come here, or when my family comes here. And they have noticed this, too. I'm so grateful to this place, and I wish them to thrive and blossom so we can savor more memories from one generation to the next!!",

My wife wanted make sure breakfast was available until close, so she called twice that morning (July 16th). No answer, but she figured it was a busy morning so they couldn't answer and she wanted to go anyway.  We drove out (about 25 minutes) with our 8 month old with us, and when we arrived the sign said closed for vacation. While we completely understand this is a family run business and of course the family should go on vacation, we can't understand why a business wouldn't change their voice mail to let potential customers know they are closed.   We would love to have tried out the food, but didn't get the chance. In the future, please change your voicemail to reflect when you are closed. Not everyone who wants to try your restaurant lives right around the corner where a quick drive to find out you're closed wouldn't be a big deal.",

It was bustling for a Thursday morning but we didn't have to wait long to be seated.  The place has hip, retro '70s California kind of vibe with classic breakfast fare.  My son ordered the chorizo burrito.  It was huge! Stuffed with eggs, chorizo, green chiles and potatoes, then smothered in a green chile sauce and Jack cheese.  His words, \"awesome\"!  My daughter ordered the Hog Heaven!  An omelet with, you guessed it, ham, bacon, sausage, and cheddar cheese.  Served with hash browns and pancakes.  No complaints on any part of it, the eggs were perfectly fluffy and filled with just enough of everything.   My chicken fried steak and eggs was delicious!  Breaded and crispy without being tough.  A real stick to your ribs meal!   Upon walking in we passed the case showing some baked goods so we had to end the meal with a brioche cinnamon roll.  Wow.  It was served warm with not too sweet icing cascading down the sides.  It is as epic as it sounds.  The owner came over and made sure everything was good as we devoured the sweet roll.  Well played.

My initial thought before arriving was that this place might end up being a bad clone of the Original Pancake House in Scottsdale. I was thrilled to see a menu that is decidedly progressive and interesting that in some ways out-shines the OPH. The brioche cinnamon rolls are absolutely out of this world. If these rolls were the only saving grace, this place would still be a winner in my book. But the omelettes (she had the Popeye sans bacon and onion; I had the Chili Cheese) were perfectly cooked (slightly more-done than other places) and came with sides that included the gluten free banana pancakes and the chocolate chip pancakes. Even the hash-browns were crispier and more thoughtfully prepared than at some other places.   Add to all this that they serve the Valley's own Cortez Coffee and genuinely freshly-squeezed OJ, and you have yourself one of the best places in PHX for breakfast.   I would be thrilled to see what variation OBH would make on OPH's famous Apple Pancake. Gluten free? Hint hint...",

I would just like to note it's not like this place was empty, in fact it was packed yet when we sat they already had our high chair waiting!! Then we ordered and literally in the time it took them to get our drinks out the food was ready !! This place honestly should stop serving food and train every other Restraunt how to serve people as they have it figured out !! I would give this place 10 stars for cistomer service if I could !!",

It was great breakfast coffee, not too strong. The waitress was also very good about helping us decide what to get. It was are first time here but we will definitely be back for more!",

Super friendly service, delicious breakfast options, and a surprise to see that coffee was on the menu not as \"coffee\" or \"drip coffee\", but as Cortez Coffee -- a Tempe, AZ based coffee roaster. Five stars for local businesses supporting other local businesses!  After perusing the menu, I opted for one of their specials -- a Triple-Berry Deep Fried \"San Francisco Style\" French Toast with a side of eggs, bacon, and the Cortez coffee. My brother-in-law was not joking when he said their French Toast was good ... it was beyond good. It was AMAZING.  I'm from the Bay, and I have never had French Toast like this. Why is it San Francisco style? Because they use sourdough bread, that's why!  If you happen to be in Phoenix, definitely stop here for breakfast. You will not regret it.",

    "text": "My SO and I have been here twice now, great experience both times.  On the first visit, he had the Lingucia & Cheddar plate with French toast & and I had the chicken mole tamale special. Our meal was complimented by coffee and OJ. The tamale was amazing; perfectly moist with a good balance of chicken to filling. The accompanying eggs and rice were also cooked to perfection. Scratch tortillas and black beans were a nice balance to the dark, rich flavors of the mole. Very delicious all around.  The SO says the Lingucia? (Portuguese) sausage was well seasoned and yummy, while I can confirm the chewy outside and soft custard-like inside of the French toast was insanely amazing.  My only criticism is really a personal preference, too much pulp in the OJ for me, the SO had the scrape a lot of it out so I could drink it.   The second visit was also awesome. The SO got the french toast with bacon and I got Juan's tacos, a lemon scone and a short stack of pancakes (yes, little girls can eat, too).  The chorizo and eggs in the taco were nicely seasoned and cooked.  Sides of guacamole, pico and black beans went well with the tacos and freshly made tortilla. The pancakes have just a hint of lemon, creating a nice flavor profile in your mouth. I thought the scone was a bit dry, but tasted great dunked in my coffee.  Both trips were on weekends. Both times we did wait, but it wasn't more than 10 minutes either time. Not too bad at all. We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Overall this place is a fantastic place for breakfast. the food is delicious, there are lots of different options for those gluten-free, vegan and slim types, the staff is great and the atmosphere takes you out of the desert and throws you to the beach! The only reason I would take out a star is mostly for the wait. I understand that places get busy no matter what but I'm really surprised that there isn't more space when they know how busy they get. Now they do an absolutely stunning job of utilizing the space and I know what kind of budgeting it takes to add on to a location (they really can't where they are at) so I'm not going to take away any stars. That and I am just a pro at making the wait time seem short (playing games like heads up or just having an actual deep conversation like a normal human being).  For those of you that don't have a lot of time to sit and eat breakfast, I'd direct you to McDonalds where everybody else with no patience/planning or taste buds go. ***FYI*** THEY ONLY TAKE CASH, they do not accept credit cards because of the fees credit cards charge (don't blame them). ~THEY DO HAVE AN ATM THAT DOES NOT CHARGE FEES~ I have used this before and there truly are no fees.  Remember kids always tip your waiters/waitresses",

I had the chocolate raspberry pancakes and loved them, it was almost like eating dessert for breakfast. Though we each threw in eggs and bacon on the side. In addition, the fresh squeezed orange juice was excellent - the best we ever had.   We went straight to the restaurant upon our arrival from Denver on a Saturday morning around 9:30 am and maybe had a 5 minute wait. The waitress was extremely friendly and service was fast. Then to top it off, the waitress surprised us and said an anonymous person bought our breakfast. We were beyond surprised and extremely grateful. That has never happened to us before in our lives!   I would have left a great review without somebody purchasing our breakfast. The food is excellent for the prices and the service was perfect. The thoughtfulness of the other patron was just wonderful act of kindness which we really wish we could have thanked them. So if you read this, thank you for making our day and starting our trip out right! Definitely visit the Original Breakfast House for a delicious breakfast.",

Yelpers here got it right: fresh and yummy food, great service, and an owner who really cares - not just about his customers, but about the neighborhood. As mentioned already, along with decent prices there is a wait on weekends, but folks are waiting for a reason. GREAT PLACE to show your support for small, independent restaurants that need local support to survive and flourish; they have earned our business. Oh... and while I've loved everything I've eaten, I especially like their sausage and pancakes, although I'm going to have to try out the deep fried french toast and spinach omelet others here have reviewed LOL",

The place is clean, and like I said earlier--everyone is so nice. I got a little red velvet cupcake when we went to pay, and it was oh-so-yummy as well! I will definitely be going back, and make it a regular place for me since I live nearby. OBH ROCKS!!!",

So, we headed that way, an hour out of our way and would absolutely do it again if I was in the area again.  The combination or the food and service, made the trip absolutely worth it.  The food is a plenty but it all looked so good, we did not hold back.  We ordered the garden hash which came with organize veggies, the potatoes were fantastic and the other veggies were not overcooked, with this for a $2.00 up charge, I ordered the cinnamon bun, which they put in a to-go box, as I knew I would not have room and they were happy to do that.  We also had the Popeye Omelet that had spinach and cheese a plenty, doing an up charge for the French Toast, which they fry.  If you like funnel cake, which is somewhat how they described it, which was completely accurate, you will love it.  If you like more traditional french toast, this may not be how you like it but it was a neat take on french toast.  I also cannot say enough about the service, it was laid back, friendly but still totally efficient and attentive.  It was great.  Go here, you will not be disappointed.  As others have stated it is CASH ONLY, so go prepared but they do have an ATM to access should you forget.",

But, aside from that, it was really a delightful experience.  Aside from the food, which was really good, the service and attitude of the wait staff was wonderful!  Every single person with whom we spoke had a smile on their face, was very polite, accommodating and professional - very surprising for a lower priced, family style restaurant.  Our server, Divina, was exceptional!  She was prompt, attentive, friendly....  simply a delight!  I hope the owners of this restaurant realize how fortunate they are to have employees such as this!   As far as the food - we each ordered a Morning Glory muffin (a carrot cake like muffin with raisins and nuts) which was served warm and was absolutely to die for!  My husband ordered the El Paso Omelette with hash browns while I ordered the Chicken Apple Sausage Scramble with fruit.  We both loved our choices.    I can't believe I have lived in the area for 14 years and am just now learning about this place.  It will, no doubt, be one of our regular breakfast spots from now on!",

The customer service once seated was fantastic even though they were clearly very busy. Food: I'm sorry that I forgot to take pictures! Husband had the gooey scramble and I had the egg white scramble with a side of Bacon. The food did not disappoint. The hubby's gooey scramble was the highlight, but none of the food disappointed. I really enjoyed the breakfast potatoes and the house hot sauce is really good. The cinnamon rolls from the pastry case were calling my name, but i managed to resist. If I make it back there I MUST try them cause they look amazing, as did the home made pop tarts. My only constructive feedback would be some better coffee; the only thing of the meal that was so-so.",

I ordered just a basic breakfast but out was the best basic breakfast I've had in a while.  The pancakes have a hint of lemon zest that makes them taste so luscious.  The home style potatoes were seasoned to perfection.  The service was so pleasant as well, would highly recommend!",

    "text": "Nice little breakfast and lunch place. Kind of off the beaten path, but worth looking for. We sat at the counter so as to not have to wait, but the folks we talked to said the wait is usually not that bad. Clientele was a mixed bag. Lots of the railroad-spike through the nose crowd, but also a smattering of families and trucker-types. Specials were listed on a white board. They had a crab omelette that sounded great tho we decided to eat off the regular menu. My wife had the French toast which looked superb. In order to make our sugar rush a bit more interesting, we split the brioche cinnamon roll which was great. Don't think I've ever seen a cinnamon roll made from brioche dough; the inventor should patent the dang thing. I usually use Cinnabon as my baseline for cinna-rollage, but this li'l gem had my standard beat generously. The Smooveness of the dough was just superb and it wasn't overly gooey like some tend to be.   Also ordered a side of biscuits and gravy which turned out to be the surprise of the meal. Man, that was one spanky side. The biscuit was fluffy and not really dense like most overworked ones you find at chain places. Plenty of sausage made this one a must have the next time I return. Couple next to us chowded down on them as a main dish. Big Larry say they knew what they were doing.   Big Larry had the chorizo burrito that was served \"smothered\" style with a green sauce and cheese. Quite good; wish there was more sauce.   Staff was friendly and helpful and good at cleaning up and seating folks. We didn't feel rushed, though. Left off a star or two for atmosphere and the noise level, but the food was excellent.",

In my case, the server handled herself and the situation perfectly.  This past weekend there was a mishap with the availability of a table. The server apologized for the mix up and made sure I got the next available table and offered a baked good for the trouble. The only negative about OBH is that the wait on weekends for breakfast can be 30+ minutes. There are a couple of benches inside to sit and wait , but most have to site outside until called for their table. It would be nice if they used a waiting app to avoid sitting outdoors when it's really hot.",

The menu is huge and it would probably have been taken me a little while to decide on an item if it wasn't for a big white box on the menu with Chicken Fried Chicken in large font; that made my decision easy. The order also comes with a side of french toast. I couldn't resist substituting the regular french toast for their mouthwatering banana pecan french toast.   Everything was amazing! Service was friendly, chicken had a nice coating, eggs cooked well and an out-of-this-world french toast. This will be my go-to breakfast/brunch spot from now on.",

This place is very popular so you have to get there early unless your going by yourself then you can just sit at the counter which was nice because I got to see them squeeze fresh oranges to make orange juice with. The staff is very friendly! The proportions are huge so you get your money's worth. I spend roughly $16.50 for eggs Benedict and a coffee but it was very well worth it. As I was walking out 12 News was coming in to do a morning special on the restaurant if that tells you how amazing it is. The only down side is that they only take cash so be prepared for that and they don't have a military/ law enforcement discount but the hostess said that on Veterans Day they do a free meal which is cool! If you forget to bring cash they have a no charge ATM right by the front door. Overall good experience.",

Went here for brunch with my husband and a friend, I ordered the fried chicken and French toast combo it was delicious. French toast was perfect and the gravy on the chicken was just so amazing! I am so glad we found this place. Prices are reasonable the only down part is they only take cash but they do have an ATM with no fees to take money out which makes up for it. Service was very good our server was friendly and attentive. We were very well taken care of during our visit. There was a small wait when we got there and they have free water bottles and a comfortable waiting area. Can't wait to go back! If you are looking for a nice family owned breakfast spot I highly recommend this place.",

I'm somewhat new to the area and have been looking for a breakfast spot with unpretentiously good food, so she invited me to go with her. The wait was about 35ish minutes around 10am on a Sunday, but I had somebody to talk to, so it went by fairly quickly. Expect a wait if you come here on the weekend. They also had an ice bucket of waters for people waiting which was really nice.   This restaurant has an old-school, homey vibe which is kind of refreshing. I'm a vegetarian who loves savory breakfast and there were more than enough options to choose from. Additionally, they seem pretty friendly about subbing veggies for meat if necessary. I opted for the garden hash with poached eggs which was a delicious blend of potatoes, veggies, and cheese. I found the portion sizes to be reasonable for the price. I'm excited to go back in the future and maybe try an eggs benedict with veggies (and no ham of course). Our server was also helpful and friendly. Overall, I would definitely come again to try more things. My friend swears by their lemon scones and freshly squeezed OJ, so I'll need to try these next time!   This place is cash only, but there are no-fee atms on site. I'd definitely recommend checking this place out. I felt that the food was hearty, unpretentiously delicious, and reasonably priced.",

    "text": "I wanted to try the Original Breakfast House based on some pretty good Yelp reviews and reviews on other foodie sites. We chose a Sunday, and it was fairly early, I'd say around 10 am. The place was packed. Of course, a good sign, but not great when you're hungry. But we hung out. They  had a young man playing piano and singing out in the courtyard as entertainment, which helped to pass the time. This is a family joint and a neighborhood place - you get an easy vibe here. We were seated in a back booth. I could tell our waitress was slammed, but she did a great job of keeping up. We took a long time deciding, but ordered glasses of that fresh OJ immediately. It's so delicious! Orders at the table included:  traditional eggs benedict; biscuits and gravy and a traditional eggs & bacon plate. The hollandaise on my benedict was superb and the eggs were actually poached! (If you've read any of my reviews about breakfasts, you'll remember that I have a thing about most restaurants not knowing the difference between \"poaching\" an egg and \"boiling\" them. Most restaurants boil their eggs instead of slow poaching them, which is why they're usually tough. But - tada! - the OBH has poaching down. What I didn't care for was the prosciutto instead of ham on the benedict. Just a personal thing. If you like prosciutto, you'll love this dish! The gravy was amazing and homemade. Bacon and eggs, well, baconey and eggey. The pancakes have lemon in them which gives them a lighter taste. Some people may not enjoy that. I thought it was interesting.  All in all, it was a very good breakfast in a nice friendly place with happy service. Heck, they even offered to refill our OJ \"to go\"!  Be forewarned, as with a lot of breakfast joints that are decent, you'll have to wait a while on the weekends.  Caution: they do not accept credit cards! It's a savings thing for the owners. They'd rather pass on money to their servers than pay the high fees associated with credit/debit transactions. So kick it old school, folks and bring a nice big wad of cash with you when you go to breakfast.",

She left and a few minutes later she returned with crisp hash browns, she said she felt bad that first order was not right. My dish was really good. My wife had spinach omelette and gave it a thumbs up. Strawberry preserves come with toast and it was really good. I had coffee and they bring out your own pot which works for me.

I had the small French toast plate which was just enough food because one slice of French toast is huge! It's crispy fried sourdough french toast which sounds different but was absolutely delicious! My fiance had the 5 egg white scramble and loved it but again tons of food, he couldn't eat the whole thing. Orange juice is fresh squeezed (you can literally watch the kids squeezing it) so it's pulpy but has the great fresh flavor. Overall, awesome! We will definitely be back! Ask for Jocelyn's section.",

It was 7 of us they told us it would take 45minutes to be seated.  We were okay with that.  Finally it was more than hour and I went in to ask how much longer.  The hostess said they were waiting for the tables to be available so we can all be together.   Looking at one side there was a couple who just got their breakfast the other ta le was waiting to order.  We asked then maybe we should be seperated.  They sat us down at 2 different 2 tables when my husband noticed the other side of the room the table they were waiting the people were getting ready to leave.  We advised the waitress along with the hostess.   When the owner son comes up and tells me he woke up in a bad mood and this was very inconvenience to move us to a different table.  And if he moves us he was going to be even more in a bad mood.  I was so surprised he said that SO UNPROFESSIONAL and So RUDE!  If it wasn't for waiting this long and we were hungry we would of walked out.  But instead I told the hostess and the waitress.  They apologized for his ruthless behavior.  The waitress was Awesome the food was good.  I know the owner knew but not once did he come up and apologize.",

It is, thankfully, not a chain (local or out of town) and it does not advertise as being the \"next best thing.\"  What it is...is great. A down to  earth  unpretentious place  that  serves great food (El Paso and spinach omelettes were scrumptious, toast was superb (not the typical ok-no-big-deal toast) and jam supplied by a Tucson-based vendor. Come to think of it, the bread may be suuplied by a Tucson vendor as well. Desiree was our server and she was great. No fewer than 3 other staff checked on us to make sure that the coffee (excellent), o.j. (a refill on the house...and it is GOOD o.j.) and everything else was to our liking. The place started to become booked at about 9:30ish as we were on  our way out.   I highly recommend OBH for a solid breakfast, great service, and a good addition to the Breakfast List.  Dr. B.",

The hostesses were extremely friendly and chatty- a nice change from many places.  Once seated, I noticed that water glasses and a carafe of ice cold water had already been put on our table.  This was awesome, especially since we waited outside to be sat and it was on the warmer side today.  Our server was friendly, prompt, and efficient.  My husband ordered the egg white scramble and I had the french toast.  They were both really good.  The jam that came with my husband's toast was also delicious.  I also appreciated that the server brought us two flavors of cream for our coffee without hesitation when we asked- as she should have.  We have been places where they act like it is an inconvenience.  I can't help if we have different preferences!  Also- I noticed a couple of reviews complained about the temperature.  I was perfectly comfortable, so whatever they had it at today is good.  I normally FREEZE everywhere I go and my husband is always hot.  We both were comfy.  Seriously, I carry a sweater year-round for restaurants... Even when it is 120 out... And I was good.  We both felt that it was a good experience and a great price point.  We also like that they use local, fresh, organic when they can.  Fresh just always tastes better! :)",

I had the 5 egg white scramble with fruit instead of potatoes, and whole wheat toast. There was no extra charge for the fruit, it was a good sized bowl with cantalope, honeydew, watermelon, strawberries, bananas and grapes. Everything was fresh, from the veggies in my scramble to all of the fruit.  The food is really good quality, certainly as good as Scramble, Over Easy and Liberty Market. Even the bread used for toast was exceptional. They did a good remodel of the place. When it was Gino's Coast to Coast, it was dark and dingy. They recovered the booths, redid the table tops, brought in new chairs and lighting, and gave the place a coat of light, fresh paint inside and out. At last, we've got a wonderful breakfast place, without driving all over town. We will be regulars.",

It's become our spot for breakfast. The ambiance is so homey I feel like I'm dining in a small town like flagstaff or Sedona. It's nothing fancy at all, and that's what I adore. You can also tell it's not a chained restaurant, the owner and his family are always around to help and greet. The host stand checks up on you as if you were their tables. The food is so delicious. Everything is fantastic. When me and my dad went I ordered a burger with fries and he got scrambled eggs. My dad is a very picky eater and wants his coffee at a certain time. Our server, I forgot her name, but she has awesome purple hair, always was on top of asking my dad if he wanted his coffee yet. Things like that just prove the great service the staff has!

Once inside, I noticed that the interior had a \"local diner\" atmosphere, kind of like a Mom and Pop restraunt. After being seated at our tiny table with no wait, we ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken and Biscuits 'n Gravy. The food was out to our table within 15 minutes and the portions were generous. After sitting down and beginning to eat, I was very put off by how hot it was inside the restraunt. It was only roughly 85 outside, yet it felt even hotter and more humid inside. I even had to ask the waitress for more napkins so that I could dab my forehead. The food was good, but the amenities need an upgrade. Central Air and larger 2 person tables would make a great improvement. I would recommend, but maybe earlier in the morning so that it is not so hot inside.",

Tasted like it had been fried in oil.  The hog heaven omelet was decent but the hash browns were too greasy. The pancakes from the kids menu ended up being the tastiest choice. Could only be bothered to come back for the cinnamon roll, nothing else was worth it.",

This is the first time I've been here since my gf said she heard great reviews of the food and service so we thought we would give it a shot. This is my first yelp review btw. First off the greeting was warm and welcoming there was a wait but not that long and we even got a booth by the window and believe me you want to sit here because I think this was just the lucky area. We seemed to get a food before other tables who we're complaining about the wait. I had the chicken fried steak and my gf had the French toast and it would of been worth the wait if it came to that. Our server recommended the chicken since the gravy tastes delicious and she sold my gf on the French toast calling it crispy crunchy deliciousness and it was definitely that. I'm not quite sure our servers name to give her some praise but she was in the front and great I think it was des so good job! A busser came up to the table and took away some of our plates and she even came back with a box for the French toast. When we went to pay the host at the front made some small talk with me and it just made both of us feel so welcomed here. So good job original breakfast house! I will be back",

The orange juice is freshly squeezed right in plain view and you get free refills. Locally baked bread and jams are delicious. Love the take on trying to provide healthy products like organic milk and cage free eggs. I had the 5 egg white scramble and it was delicious!!!",

We have given it 3 chances and all 3 times poor service, cold food and flies flying by the windows. The first time in the server told us she was tired and the food was ok. We then tried it a few weeks later, with friends and our server was nice but randomly brought me a refill and said \"Don't worry I'm not dirty\". We were silent because this was a very weird thing to say... and randomly. She then said \"I didn't want you to see pen marks on my arms and worry I was serving you while dirty it's just busy\". We all were polite and said no you're fine but couldn't help but joke about that after- who says that? Today we went back with the same couple and we had the server we had our first time in. She was rude, barely spoke to us, slow to refill empty drinks and my fiance had cold hash browns. We will not be returning- Sorry gave it 3 tries.",

There is a no-fee ATM machine inside.    The service is beyond friendly here.  As soon as we were seated, our server offered to start us off with beverages.  We went with the organic fresh squeezed orange juice. It's so refreshing and sweet.  You even get a free refill. The juice goes so well with the hearty breakfast.   Our breakfast choices: **** \"Famous\" chicken fried chicken with fried French toast and 2 eggs.  The chicken is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  It's topped with a country gravy.  Creamy and delicious!  The French toast was actually good deep fried and not greasy.  **** Crab omelette: one of their weekend specials. 3 eggs with mozzarella cheese and large chunks of fresh crab meat.  Topped with the hollandaise sauce. Oh my so good!!  Add the hot pepper sauce and it will make your taste buds roar!!  We found our breakfast spot for the next visit to AZ.  Down home delicious breakfast and exceptional service. A must try when in the area.",

Plus our sever was very sweet and quick at getting us served and making us feel welcomed. I had the El Paso Omelette with house fries and my girlfriend had the Chilaquiles. The omelette was tasty with a kick and the house fries were nice and crispy. The chilaquiles were enjoyed by her which is surprising because she is quite the harsh food critic when it comes to Mexican dishes. She loves the crispy chips, Chile on top, and well flavored eggs. Definitely recommend for a morning bite to eat.",

Yes, they had an ATM there by the door but I am not paying a fee from my bank or from this place to pay cash for a breakfast that I don't even know if I was going to enjoy!

My friends and I came on a Sunday morning and we knew we were going to wait because of its high reviews and the fact that it was a weekend. We checked in and were told that it would be a 45-1 hour wait. The line moves pretty quickly and we were seated in 30 mins.   They have their original menu and specials. We decided on the chicken fried steak with French toast and tiramisu pancakes. We each got an orange juice too which came with 1 free refill.   The chicken fried steak was pretty good. The chicken retained some juices and was not completely dry. They cut up the chicken into smaller pieces compared to other places where they give you a big slab of chicken. The French toast edges were a little hard but it just gave the toast more texture.   When the tiramisu pancakes came, all I could think of was diabetes, seeing all the sauce on top. It was surprisingly a subtle sweetness and the sauce complimented the pancakes well. They were super fluffy as well. This was on their special menu so come and try it before they switch things up.   Our server Emily and staff were super attentive. Food came out in a timely manner and we did not have to flag anyone down for anything. You can tell that the staff is working in unity. Would definitely recommend people who are first timers in Arizona to check this place out.",

Ordered the asparagus, bacon and goat cheese scramble. That alone was one of the best things I've ever had in my life! My girlfriend got the French toast (see attached picture), both were appealing on the eyes and even better appealing on our tastebuds!   I forgot the host name but she was such a sweetheart! Possibly the owner? Got to meet John and you could tell he took extreme pride in his establishment and the food he served!   Recently moving from California it was so nice to see the surfboards and beach decor! I LOVE the fact that starting September 1st they won't accept credit cards and offer a FREE ATM! As someone who has been around small businesses his whole life I know how much those fees can be. Instead of passing it on to the customer John decided to eat the cost of the ATM fee!

The waitstaff is so friendly and if you ask about the specials, you can tell, they love the food too!",

We were asked if we wanted to be seated at the counter and although for a single person it would be great, not so much for a party of 3.  There was a ton of activity behind the counter, it's busy I get it but because I was hoping to catch up with my visiting guests it was not very enjoyable at the counter.  We each ordered something different, chilaquiles, pancakes, and an omelet.  They served the chilaquiles with crispy chips, which I enjoyed, but the salsa verde lacked flavor, salt...something.   I found the omelet bland.  Now for the pancakes...I ordered the chocolate chips w/raspberries pancakes.  I was unimpressed that they did not fold in the chocolate chips in the batter.  They served a stack of pancakes with chocolate chips tossed on the top with raspberries.  It looked sloppy.  That right there killed it for me.",

    "text": "Loved it here!  The staff was friendly, the food was great, and not enough can be said about that orange juice!  I came in on a Saturday morning at about 9:30 and had no trouble finding two spots at the counter.  The waitress quickly greeted us and by looking on Yelp beforehand I knew I had to try the orange juice.  Sitting at the counter I was able to watch this stuff get fresh squeezed right in front of me before getting poured into my glass!  It's thick and pulpy and has just the right amount of sweetness.  It's on the pricey side but you do get a refill, which came at the perfect time when my meal arrived.  I had the El Paso omelet with chorizo, black beans, sour cream, guacamole, and pico de gallo.  The three egg omelet was stuffed with what I considered to be very good chorizo.  Next time I'll ditch the black beans, but I enjoyed having the guacamole and sour cream to put on top.  I didn't realize I could get both home fries AND pancakes with my omelet.  Needless to say, I had to waddle myself out of the restaurant after scarfing that all down!  Such is life...  From the time I sat down to the time I paid and left totaled about 40 minutes, which is ideal for a Saturday morning breakfast.  The crowd waiting outside at about 10:15 was pretty big, so I'd recommend coming earlier if you can roll out of bed that early.",

She said she would let them know that. I had no issues, they made sure to be careful about any cross contamination. When we were leaving, we found out that they also have gluten free buns and that if you order a sandwich or burger; they can switch it with a gluten free bun.

You look for local, original, great breakfast joints for those Saturday or Sundays you don't feel like making breakfast at home. Thank goodness there is Yelp and hubby found this place after a little research and we knew we found our place after reading that they use produce from local farms and even some organic ingredients.   I noticed that only a few places in Phoenix take your name down on a Sunday morning, so we headed over there around 9:30 risking a long wait. Surprisingly, we only had to hang around for fifteen minutes before we got seated.   The menu wasn't big and they have really good decaf coffee, so we were off to a great start. As for the breakfast itself goes, hubby is 14 Portuguese, so he had to try the linguica eggs (side of meat biscuit and gravy) and I couldn't take my eyes off of the banana pecan pancakes on the menu. We ended up sharing everything and were super full by the end. The biscuit and gravy tasted super fresh and was probably one of the best I have had.   By the time we left it was 11 am and there was a long line of people outside, so try to go there early if you want to avoid the crowed.",

After explaining this about 2 minutes later he came and directed us to a spacious booth.   We did not tell him we did not want the table, he simply did this on his own accord. It may seem small gesture but it was a Saturday morning completely packed and I'm sure it would have been easier to get another party seated.

Our server was very attentive and had a wonderful attitude. It was very busy even for a weekday. The food was ok. Basic breakfasts. My son had french toast, was crunchy and wasn't a fan. My veggie omelette had too many undercooked onions.  My other kids liked theirs. The atmosphere was nice but they definitely need to change the flooring.  How they feel carpet is sanitary for a restaurant, I don't know. Don't feel we will go back.  Also heard they no longer take credit cards.",

I ordered the chicken fried chicken and my friend had the biscuits and gravy. The gravy had a sweet taste which I didn't particularly enjoy and the biscuits were too hard... Not the soft fluffy homemade biscuits I was hoping for. The chicken fried chicken had potential to be good but I didn't think it was great. The chicken itself was super fried and crispy which was nice but smothered in the gravy which was not good. Also, it was all quite bland, definitely needed salt or hot sauce or something to give it some flavor. It came with some French toast which looked like it was also deep fried, but it was pretty delicious. My friend had ordered a cinnamon roll which was very delicious! Soft, fluffy with plenty of icing. If I were to go here again I'd definitely try something else!",

She is quite the snob when it comes to breakfast foods so for her to like the way they cooked it says it is a place worth trying.   We were almost constantly attended to and the people behind the counter were really friendly and arrive oriented.   The place is a bit outdated, lacked spark, and when we first sat down there was a long wait for someone to get to us.   Will I go back? Maybe. It's a better alternative to the lame Denny's or IHOP, that's for sure! Food is good though so if you are looking for a nice, big, typical breakfast I suggest going here.",

EVERYTHING else was DELICIOUS!  You can definitely tell the ingredients were fresh and  homemade! Their bread was sliced thick, OJ was  soooo yummy and the BlackBerry FrenchToast was sweet but with the sourdough bread/zest not overwhelming! Plus the bacon was crispy just the way I love it!

I should have taken a hint from the woman next to us with her two young sons that my service would be slow since she had to go up to the register to find her food.  Waiting an hour for food that is mediocre at best should never be acceptable.  The waitress recommended Juan tacos. This meal and the potatoes were bland, flavorless and one of the worst I've ever had. I actually preferred a McDonalds burrito over this.  Our waitress came once to give us coffee and take our order and never showed up again. Someone else brought us our food an hour later. We asked for the manager and some snotty kid came over and stated \"I'm sorry\" with an I don't care attitude. He knew he was getting a pay check and that's all that matter to him. When we got to the front counter, the cashier was kinder than the manager.  We asked for the owner since it had slowed down by the time we FINALLY got our food. We waited fifteen minutes because we were told he was coming over and he NEVER showed.  The worst part was three tables came in after us and left long before us. It was completely unacceptable. I will never be back and I will never recommend this place to anyone.",

We waited and went to Safeway across the street to do some shopping. There is also a Walgreens.   The staff that greeted us was very friendly even though it was busy. We ordered:  Breakfast sandwich  Biscuits and gravy  Strawberry French toast Green chili side Yogurt parfait   Service was 5/5. Kimberly was so kind even though they were short staffed-- If you're are lucky you will get her to serve you. The food was good, I would order the breakfast sandwich (5/5) and yogurt parfait (5/5 ask for maple syrup for the parfait) again but would pass on the other dishes.",

We ordered our food - Kids Pancake with Bacon, Chicken Apple Scramble with pancakes and home fries, French Toast, and a Cinnamon Roll!  (We always share our plates, so I got to taste all but the bacon.  But it was a nice thick slice!)  All of the food was DELICIOUS!  The portions were generous and the price was reasonable!  I would have given 5 stars.... if I hadn't killed a cockroach in the bathroom.  If this place wasn't so talked up, rated well, and recently featured as the best place in AZ, we would have left & never came back.  Of course I let someone know about the roach & hopefully it's handled.",

Our server came to check on us multiple times, she also brought my OJ refill without me asking.   I got the pancake special which includes 2 pancakes, 2 eggs and a side of bacon or sausage. I got the raspberry chocolate chip pancakes which were good but just a little too sweet for my palate. Next time, I would try their banana and pecan waffle which looks good.   The freshly squeezed Orange juice which comes with a free refill is totally worth it. It does have some pulp which I don't mind but I'm sure you could ask them to strain it if desired.   I would definitely return but probably go earlier so I am not waiting for that long. So far there's only one breakfast place in the Phx/Scottsdale area I would wait for up to an hour for breakfast.",

We got their famous chicken fried chicken which comes with 2 eggs, toast, and a slice of their french toast. We also got the blueberry pancakes. We liked the banana pecan french toast, has that crispy \"San Francisco\" style exterior but not the pancakes because it has a lemon zest flavor. They were big and fluffy but not just our kind of pancakes. The fried chicken had good flavor, not overly breaded which I like but nothing amazing.  Service was great, they try to be as attentive as possible but expect a little delay because of the crowd. I would come back for my french toast cravings.",

I know, who would think scrambled eggs would be worth mentioning? But they are. After the food, I fell in love with the people who work there. It all starts when you walk in the door and see Teresa, Katie, Sierra and the owner, John. They always have a smile on their face and willing to help. They will even be in the dining room to clear your plate, give you another beverage, etc. Finally, a company who has amazing customer service and not people who sit back and say \"that's not my job\". The owner treats his employees very well and you can tell they all respect him. They are cash only now but do have a FREE ATM. Going cash only allowed the owner to give his employees extra perks that you don't usually see in the service industry. You may find a wait that looks long when you pull up. Don't let that scare you away as they turn the tables fast and the food is incredible. I promise, you won't be disappointed.",

Looked around Yelp and although OBH was a little further than I wanted to drive, this place was worth every mile! From the moment we walked in, we were treated with kindness and attentiveness.  Our server, Emily, was one of the best servers we have ever had at ANY restaurant.  She was someone who spoke with a smile and looked like she really loved her job.  Her attitude and spirit made our breakfast just that much more enjoyable.  Now the food was off the charts.  Both my mom and I ordered omelets.  Omelets are hit and miss as most places overcook and burn eggs, not OBH.  The omelet was cooked perfectly and the amount of ingredients was spot on.  Whenever I am in town, OBH will place I always go!",

Also amazing!!!! Next I'm gonna order the banana pecan and I'm pretty sure that I will love those too!   Then there is lunch. I don't like mortadella but the fried bologna sandwich...Heaven! And the BLT was seriously the best BLT I've ever had. I'm shocked I'm saying that only because I've had a million. BLT is my 1st choice, eat it almost everyday sandwich and this blew me away!!!!!!

When the menu says you get 2 slices of french toast, it doesn't mention that they cut the loaf of bread the long way and you're going to get a literal pound of delightful fried bread goodness.  Get some orange juice while you are at it. A lot of places claim to have fresh squeezed orange juice, but here you see the squeeze it and you can really taste the difference.

    "text": "French toast - NO BRAINER! It's INSANE. Tip: get one slice for a $1 more when added to an omelette. That's plenty, it's like eating dessert for breakfast, it's so rich. And spend the extra $1 for real maple syrup.   Five egg white omelette - pleasantly surprised that it was light and fluffy!  Oatmeal with bananas and pecans, with a nice selection of toppings.   Fresh squeezed OJ - a rarity!  They have full range; a decadently delicious fried french toast, and perfectly made egg white omelette.",

    "text": "BEST BREAKFAST EVER! The chicken fried chicken is so delicious and filling. I would recommend going during the week- I have waited up to an hour for a table on the weekend! But that just tells you how fabulous this place is. Have also tried the big gooey mess. Get it without onions if you don't like an overload of big onion chunks!! The big cinnamon rolls are worth every penny as well. My family and I go here often. 5 stars! My only complaint would be to add more locations valley wide!",

    "text": "Pretty good! :-) Mom got the Green Chile Omelette & liked it! :-) I got the blackberry pancakes & they were yummy! :-) Only thing that bugged me was that the \"pancake special\" was offered to me, which adds 2 bacon/sausage & 2 eggs. I'm allergic to eggs, so I asked if they could drop the eggs & double the bacon. I was told they'd check. Brought pancakes & 3 bacon (not 4). Bill came & pancakes & bacon were charged separately. Not real pleased by that, but otherwise good place!  Nice place & staff! :-)  P.S., The bacon was pretty thick & crisp, which is how I like it, so that was really good! Even minus a piece :-P haha",
