Our waitress was quick and accommodating as our party quickly grew to more than expected.  We had been here once before a few years back and my husband and I both agreed that the service and the food was better this time.  The beer was cold, the food was great. This is a good spot to continue a good time after special events in the area.",

We sat a waited and waited. Our waitress was at another table which had a large party and pretty much ignored us. After about 20 minutes I asked another waitress for our bill and she asked us what we had and attempted to figure out what everyone had. I gave my money to the first waitress and she went to the register, got my change and put it in the black bill folder and put it under her arm.  She then went to other tables and began taking orders and again ignored us. We didn't get our change until I asked the supervisor to get it for me. Very disappointing evening with frustration on our last evening of our visit to Phoenix. Probably never visit another Tilted Kilt due to the way we were ignored.",

Our waitress Erica was very fast with every request!  Being from San Antonio, wasn't expecting much from the Chips and Salsa but was surprised at how good they were! Very chunky with great seasoning and flavor. Another appetizer that I highly recommend is the garlic fries. Possibly the most antisocial thing to eat but as long as everyone in your party has a few, it's all good! ;)  Everyone seems to focus on the girls in kilts but there is something for female customers too. All the male staff members are wearing kilts too. LOL",

    "text": "We went to the Tilted Kilt for dinner after the D'Backs game yesterday (Sunday) April 27, 2015. It was myself, my son and his friend. The place was really crowded and we had to wait 20 minutes for a table. When we were seated, it took a while for a waitress to come over to us. When she did, she was pleasant and polite. We ordered drinks. They came pretty quickly. We ordered our dinner then and it took a really long time for the dinner to be served. Our drinks were already gone. We wanted to order a second round, but no one was to be found. The dinner finally arrived, but we had no utensils or napkins. We asked the girl that brought the food to us and she said she would find our server. Would it be so difficult to just bring utensils? don't you think it would take less time bringing the utensils and napkins than go looking for our waitress and then have her go find the napkins and utensils?  I ordered the Tilted Club. The bacon was limp and undercooked. No one likes limp bacon. There was also no pickle. We have eaten here many, many times and I like the Tilted Club. It always comes with a pickle. Not today. Well, halfway into our meal, I spilled my drink all over. I used my napkin and my sons friends napkin to clean it up. I went to the front desk to find someone (anyone) to report this to. The hostess said she would find our server. How come no one can find our server??  Well, they found her. She came over and left to get some one else that could us with the spilled drink all over the floor. Some guys came over with a wash cloth to wipe down the table. A wash cloth?? He then used the same washcloth to wipe the floor. Really?? No towels or paper towels to dry the wetness?? There was still ice on the floor and the floor was still wet. Any one walking by could have slipped and fallen and gotten hurt.   I was hoping the server would have re-filled my drink, but her inattententiveness did not a  permit her to do so. I also had no napkin for the remainder of the time we were there.   To top this off, I went to use the restroom and it smelled like a sewer. The toilet was clogged and the content from the bowl had spilled onto the floor. What a mess!  Needless to say, we will NEVER frequent the Tilted Kilt downtown again. I would urge everyone to stay away until they clean up their act.",

There was ample staff though to the point where the girls were tripping over each other to push food and drinks out so I'm not sure what the problem was.   Our appetizer came out with our meals which I hate and thus have to ding them for that. The other ding has to do with the appetizer itself. I get that they want to offer a 'happy hour' for appetizers but to charge me $3 for 1 piece of an appetizer to share between 3 people when I could spend $3 more to get an adequate portion for each of us is a little ridiculous. Drinks were not kept full and overall it was just a meh experience.   It's a fun place and I can see why people like it but if you are going for any sort of gastronomic experience--go elsewhere.",

We sat there for over a half an hour watching the bartenders just chat with themselves and dance for the manager right in the corner next 2 us and finally we had enough. We asked for the bill and thanked them for never coming back to check in on us at which the bartender said \"oh sorry\" with an attitude. We spoke to the manager when we left to let him know what a disappointing experience we had. He offered to get someone who could take our order and would even comp us but that was not why we wanted to talk to him, it was more about him knowing what type of service was being given in his restaurant.

We waited a long time to get our drinks refilled and nobody cleared out our finished items. No other server came by. And we closed out as a favor to her. unfortunately I will come back because they have better TVs than any other place. I would have given 1 star for this experience, but the other times I've been here, I got good service. Plus i had a little time to reflect. Still a good place to watch games because they have better tvs than other sports bars. Buffalo wild wings may comes close. So I gave two more. Food is ok.",

I can't really say it's a wannabe Hooters - but they are definitely looking to attract a certain crowd, that's why they are located a short walk from the arena and stadium.  We went in on a Saturday afternoon before a game, expecting a crowd. There wasn't really anyone there - we had 1 beer and left. We had already eaten, so we didn't even look at the menu.  The beer selection is good, but not great. They could definitely improve there.  We sat at the bar and although she wasn't rude, the bartender definitely wasn't friendly either. Turns out it was just about the end of her shift and she must've just been ready to go. The guy who replaced her was much nicer, but we were just ready to go at that point.  It costs us almost $18 for 1 cider and 1 beer - which is pretty high, in my opinion. But I guess expected, based on the location. I'm not a big fan of this chain to begin with, and this location certainly did nothing to change my mind.  My suggestion is to avoid it and find a better local spot.",

I think if anything it's really just a random sports bar that people go to to watch games especially since the United Airlines arena is right across the street from here.   Had the boneless BBQ wings which were okay and a Stella beer. Only thing I really took away from this bar is that the waitresses were really F'N hot. Other than that though, nothing to brag about too much. Spacious and cool for large groups but I don't know, didn't really do it for me.",

What's not to love. Haha.  So since it was a Friday and I couldn't eat meat I ordered the Quinlan's five cheese flat bread. I saw that it had a basil pesto sauce and thought yes please! Lol. I was disappointed. It was sooooo bland. Like really bland. =/   Drinkssss... I ordered the Celtic crush. A different waitress brought my drink. When I tried it, it was extremely sour. Our original waitress came and said she  noticed that my drink didn't look how it should've. So they made me a new one. It tasted like a screwdriver. Lol. The second drink was a purple haze. Wasn't a big fan of that thing either.   To sum up I wasn't a fan of the food and the drinks weren't anything special. Not to mention parking is horrible!!! I drove around for 20 minutes looking for parking and ended up paying like $15. You'd think they would have their own parking but they don't. I probably wouldn't come again on a normal day. It's a cool place to hang out with the homies though to watch a game or to stop by after the suns game.",

We asked for a table with  a 5th seat as one of our friends was stuck in traffic, we felt like the gal that seated us scoffed at us for asking for a table bigger than our party, it was a Friday night and although not too busy at the moment she told us that it'd be gettting busy after the Suns game. We sat down and chose our beverages, it's hard to get used to paying $7 for a glass of draft beer, they are $3 and $4 where i live. We also ordered water. We asked about the loaded , buffalo and chili tots, she told us they made their own sauce... we chose the buffalo and chili tots, and some wings to start with. The wings were mediocre, and dry. The Tots that did come were saturated in Franks Red Hot sauce with a few, and i mean few sprinkles of bleu cheese. Since they were so saturated they fell apart making them very difficult to eat, they really werent that good, but we were hungry and were paying for the meal. The Chili tots that were ordered came out as a bowl of tortilla chips and a small cast iron fry pan  with some good chili, it's a little sweet and that made it really tasty. About the only positive thing we can say about our experience. Although it wasn't what we ordered. The whole while we watched up to 5 girls screw around at the cash stand, not paying any attention to customers while we waited to have drinks refilled and eventually get our check..our friend that was with us kept commenting how his wife who has owned her own restaurant,  would have fired them on the spot....we are pretty sure we could have walked out without paying for our meal without them noticing,  while not the Right thing to do, we have to admit it was tempting due to the horrible meal and service we received. In addition to having to ask and then wait over 10 minutes for our check. We don't recommend this place to anyone.... YUCK! Terrible and Over Priced!! We had way better Fast Food later in the night as we hadnt eaten much of our dinner.",

Ive worked in the industry in a very busy establishment in another state and we are often understaffed but we always greet our new patrons and take at least a drink order within five minutes (at the most). We made eye contact with three servers and not even a hello. I got it, Thursday at like 9:30 is like the busiest time at a restaurant  (chris said sarcastically) but give me a break. Disappointed in all aspects.  I'm updating this because shortly after I wrote this review I received a message from the manager. He was extremely professional and I felt like he honestly wanted to rectify my experience. While my first review won't change I want everyone to know that their management takes the time to read these reviews and obviously takes them seriously. I respect that.",

Honestly, it's not that bad compared to what some women choose to wear when they go out anyway! Nice touch to make the male bussers wear kilts too :-)  The Tilted Kilt has a fantastic location, in Cityscape, above Arrogant Butcher and directly across the street from US Airways Center. They have the MOST tv's with ESPN, NFL Network and other access that I have ever seen, including a giant, projection screen.   Tilted Kilt boasts a full bar and good beer selection. I was thrilled to see they served Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy! Their food is typical sports bar fare: burgers, salads, sandwiches. But their entrees are a little more varied with salmon, shepherd's pie, fried chicken and more! I LOVED their fries that I got with the French Connection burger (au jus on the side please).   Parking at CityScape sucks. It's an underground garage with limited spaces and don't forget to validate your ticket or you could pay a lot of $$!! On game days/nights, I have seen them charge $10-20 just to park there, which sucks if you're not going to the game.   Can't wait to go back & try out the patio when the weather cools down!",

I am in no way saying the place has cockroach infestation BUT the fact that it had one on the outside deck where we just ate will forever deter me from returning.  Don't waste your time; there are plenty of other places downtown to eat at!",

    "text": "I understand the comparisons to Hooters--cute gals serving up cold suds and wings to a mostly male crowd--but the Kilt has a much more sophisticated menu and incomparable draft beer list.   Some of the Downtown girls are a little green--this location just opened July 5--but I'm guessing that All-Star Week provided a nice trial by fire. They'll thrive during the Diamondbacks' pennant chase and upcoming Suns game. Close proximity to the stadiums with excellent second-level CityScape views. Nice patio too once the summer heat breaks.  The only entree I've ever eaten is Chicken Tender Wrap. It's excellent. The Nachos are decent and enough to feed 6. Wouldn't recommend the Barbecue Chicken Quesadilla.    The Tilted Kilt has good food, not great, but really it's the atmosphere you're coming for.",

Of course anything downtown looking for parking is horrible, but as long as your parking on cityscape parking area they can stamp it so no need to pay for parking.  Service was eh, no one was there to greet us right away, I think they just happen to walk away as we entered, to maybe seat someone before us.  Anyways it wasn't packed because we just got there before it did, well it took a few minutes till we got seated.  No server came to us for a good 5-10 minutes, and we were like WTH there's not that  much people in here yet, anyways our server finally came and focus on us for awhile, while we decided what we wanted and she started looking around like she was ignoring us, it seems like she was looking or waiting on someone.  As soon as she got our order she immediately went to a table of older guys who just happen to be seated(I'm assuming there regulars/big tippers) she was flirting with them which i don't care, but at least put our order in 1st and then flirt!! Well since it was our lunch break and time was not on our hands, and the food finally came, but we said if we could have it to go now, because we needed to go back to work, she gave us a dirty look and a big sigh but i'll give her credit she smiled when she did that, but hey if she only put our order first we would have gladly eaten there. Anyways overall my co-workers wasn't impress with the place, I've gone there a few times and yes it has happen to me before, but I went when it was busy and that day it wasn't that busy right away.  Were gonna try twin peaks hopefully there service is better, sorry tilted  kilt :(",

As soon as we sat down the server asked us for drinks and everything was good so far. They changed shifts AND OUR SERVER CHANGED our server looked like she just woke up and came to work after a long night of partying, just looked like she didn't want to be there. Another thing i noticed is that there were only dudes in there ( literally no girl customer in there what so ever ). We ordered the food and it was CRAP ( not edible food) we ordered as follows:  1. Black bean wrap- Great vegetarian option but it was too dry, not tasty at all seemed like it was sitting for a while so it  was chewy and very pricy ( not worth it )  2. Irish nachos- Their signature item, I don't eat beef so i got it replaced for chicken. There was not enough cheese on it and you could not even tell there was chicken on it. the taste was blend and just seemed disgusting.  3. Wings with signature sauce- seems like i was eating shredded chicken ( either it was way too soft or that was not chicken ) it was not cooked well either. i would rather have gone to BWW to eat a meal. overall it was CRAPY wings  4. Garlic Fries- they said this was one of there best selling dish, i don't know how, but to me there was more grease then fries itself just disgusting .  we are just so out of it, seems like this restaurant ( irish pub & eatery) concentrates more on how sluty there waitress should look then the food. THIS FRANCHISE WILL NOT SURVIVE FOR LONG TIME, THEY WILL CLOSE SOON. If you want to have fun here then drink over priced beer and look at some tits, but i rather do that at a strip club where i can actually see their tits for a price. I would suggest you to find a better place to go then this 'BREASTURANT'",

Our waitress was either having a tough night or just not with it. I was in town for the MLB All Star events and as soon as the derby ended 100s of people were in this place. We beat the rush to a table, but the waitress had trouble with refills, mixed up our orders, and forgot to bring the check a few times.  The jalapeno burger was really good and the sweet potato fries are a must. They are crunchy and crispy. The kilt burner mayo from the burger made a good dip too. My friend said his Big Arse Burger was just okay.",

Whoever the blonde hostess was between 9:30-10pm Sat. 10/23 at the downtown Phoenix location needs to learn how to smile. From the moment we walked in the door until she put our menus on the table felt like she was being bothered to help us....your customers....no smile, no enjoy your meal.....nothing. I thought maybe it was because it was late and we had our 12 y/o son with us but I watched her seat three other tables near us....same attitude....we at least got eye contact.....yay!! And when we left, she was standing at the hostess stand by herself, leaning against the back counter.....again no smile, thank you for coming......NOTHING!! Pretty girl but very ugly attitude!! I know she's young but someone might want to tell her if she's having fun with customers while she's working....her shift will go by much faster!!  We will be back and probably sooner than later for some yummy food and cold beer!! Just thought you might like to retrain or switch out your front line personal.",

After 2 bites I could see it was completely raw.   Naturally I sent it back.  When we were presented with the check I saw I was charged for two burgers.   I figured they would have comped the burger, certainly not charge for two.  I brought it to the waitresses attention and she removed one of them.  At this point I was a bit annoyed as it appeared that they were hoping maybe I would just pay the bill and not notice.  I asked for the manager and explained what had happened.  Still no offer to do anything.   He said he would have to talk to the GM.   I assumed he pretended to talk to someone, as I can't imagine a manager doesn't have the authority to offer a $13 credit.   After 5 minutes he comes back and says the GM agreed to take 1/2 off the burger as they can't credit for consumed food.  Usually in a situation like this you want to do something to leave a customer with a good feeling to make up for the mistake.   Not here.",

There was nothing blatantly bad about my experience but the vibe, the clientele, everything about just kind of sucked. There was nothing about the vibe or atmosphere that made me want to stay...in fact I left after one beer.  The place just opened up, so it's quite possible that everyone is stil getting their bearings so I'll probably pop in one more time in a few months to see if the vibe is the same.   The bar is indoor/outdoor and opens onto a a concrete patio that is definitely the best feature at this location. The patio has awesom eastern views of downtown and it's really cool in the late afternoon early evenings.

Lots of girls in small clothing running around tables full of mostly business men with a few ladies sprinkled in.    We had a few appetizers (irish nachos, wings, and garlic fries).  Nothing blew me away . . . correction, the food didn't blow me away, but it was fine.

Upon entering, the music was totally to loud(I am a musician and love music). Everyone was yelling to have a conversation. We were sat on the patio. First ordered a cup of the cheese soup with veggies and beer. My wife took a spoonful and said, wow, this is really thick Bobby. I took a taste and said, yes, because it is nacho cheese for chips. Told server and she brought the soup. No mgr. came by to apologize. I thought this being an Irish pub the Fish and Chips must be awesome! I ordered it. Received fish that was so over cooked it tasted like fish flavored chips. I sent it back only to again receive 2 pieces same way and 3rd. pc. a little over cooked. Still, no mgr. to talk to us. Sad but the Fish and Chips @ Culver's beats TK's hands down and they are not known for Fish and Chips. Either the cooks don't care, or were not properly trained. This is just constructive criticism. I would like to mention this was a Monday night and not very busy. Also, a lot of smoking on the patio. not sure of the smoking laws. Thanks for your time. Bobby Wilson",

But the food really is decent, the atmosphere is nice and, despite what some say, okay for family (I have seen lots of families with kids eating there on game days).  But, to be honest, none of that rates a five star review.  For me, the reason for five stars is the nice, hardworking, fun people who work at the restaurant.  They are Five-Star People.  This place is close to work and relatively fast and the staff does not mind helping me with my newspaper crossword puzzles at lunch.  Everyone at the restaurant, from the hostesses, the the servers, the bussers (yes, the bussers) and the management, is really friendly.  I have had all of them sit down and chat with me at one time or another.  My friend, Melissa H., would say I have been ensorceled by the young girls but the fact is they are friendly and full of energy.  Special props go to Michelle (Meesh), Sarah, Kim, Annie and Denielle and to their great manager, MJ.  This is not the place to go if you want to wow a client, woo a girlfriend or impress her parents.  If you just want decent, simple food in a fun atmosphere with fun people, this may be the place for you.",

I will definitely be back to people watch and have some beers!",

    "text": "My boyfriend & I went here before the Suns game a couple weeks back and sat on the patio. Even though it was a Saturday, the place was fairly empty because we arrived around 3. We ordered pretzels as an appetizer, I had chicken tenders & he had wings. The food was okay. Not bad, but nothing to get excited about. The both of us were also having cocktails (very expensive by the way- $8 for a beer or for a well vodka!) but we were willing to spend the money. The 1 star is in relation to the service. We had service until the food came out. Our server checked on us once while we were eating, but never saw her again after that. We were both ready for another drink, and sat with empty glasses for probably 20 minutes. THIRTY minutes pass by without our server coming by at all, so we finally go up to the host stand, point out our table, & tell them that we've had no service. Apparently that wasn't important to them, because five more minutes pass and still, nothing. We finally go up to the bartender, order a drink from her, & she tracks down our server. She comes back and makes an excuse that she got triple sat inside & asked someone else to check on us - though not a single other employee did despite our annoyed looks. They took 15% off of the bill, but a manager never came over to speak with us. We cashed out & continued drinking at the bar, but only for our lack of time before the game. Ok food, terrible service. Especially for the drink prices.",

I got the hand breaded boneless wings and the outside breading was soggy, the fries were mediocre and thin and they had a very pompous attitude. The girls just stood and talked for like 2 minutes before asking us anything when we walked in. Hooters is much more welcoming and I prefer their wings. I will make a stand next time anyone wants to drag me to this awful place. All around awful experience. And for the 3rd time I literally cringe when I hear the name of this place. Every experience here has been just horrible. Go anywhere but here!",

My experience here over final 4 weekend was sub standard. We arrived at around 3pm with no one to seat us,so after waiting 5 to ten minutes we sat at the bar. The bartender was a poor attendent serving beer with foam running over dirty glasses. When I asked his supervisor for a glass without lipstick, he replied \"That's not your color? I bet it was a very attractive woman that had this glass before you.\" You would think the place had 50 people at the bar instead of the 7 I counted. Luckily there are other choices in downtown Phoenix. I would be a bad yelper if I did not warn you of the incompetance/douchebagery of this specific establishment.",

They have a full bar, and a decent food selection. We shared an appetizer sampler plate and I enjoyed the Shepard's Pie.

After lots of Yelp research, this location provided us with a private room, a draft board, a food discount, and outlets (HDMI and power). Yep, for one night I was a fantasy football geek. Oh who am I kidding, I am always a fantasy sports geek. Anyway, the room was great and offered us plenty of space for 15. The service was very good with no issues to note. As for the food, I ordered their fish tacos and was shocked how good they were. The fish was moist and the sauce was plentiful (often not the case with fish tacos) and tasty. I elected for fries over chips and they too were good. Overall, very good meal that I was not expecting.  My only complaint about the whole experience was the Internet. Numerous times throughout our online draft the Internet cut out. Fortunately it did not impact selections but it did provide scares from time to time. Being a dorky fantasy sport guy again, sorry.",

I'm guessing most of the customers don't mind this (see reference to creepy old dudes in reviews below)...but I do mind.  So, my co-workers and I have decided to order pick-up a few times.  They can't even get that right.  Too bad, the food is fine.  I usually order the buffalo chicken wrap, which I happen to like a lot...but let's face it, I can get buffalo chicken sandwich at Lucky Stripe for $3 less and be reasonably sure I'll get what I order when I order it.",

    "text": "Went to the Tilted Kilt on Sunday morning to watch the NFL games.  Free parking was available on the surrounding streets.  There were also several parking garages within a block of the restaurant.  The restaurant is located on the second floor of the building at 2 East Jefferson.  Look for the escalator.  We arrived at kickoff, and there were plenty of tables in the main dining area and seats at the bar.  I was with a group of friends from the Bay Area, so we found the Raiders-Texans game and got a table.  The breakfast menu is limited to four choices.  We chose the Tilted Kilt Breakfast: three eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, toast.  Our food came out within five minutes of ordering.  It was pretty good.  There are plenty of TVs all over the restaurant, so it is easy to find your game.  The Tilted Kilt girls were friendly, and looked great in the mini plaid skirts.  The Raiders beat the Texans in a close game!!  After the game most of our group left, so there were only three of us remaining.  We noticed three open seats at the bar.  We closed our tab, and moved to the bar for the afternoon games.  I enjoyed sitting at the bar more than the dining area.  The bar has five TVs side by side so you can watch five games at once.  If you play fantasy football, being at the bar is the perfect spot.  For the afternoon games, we ordered Irish Nachos, the cheesesteak salad, the bbq bacon cheeseburger, and beer.  The salad and burger were good, but we were disappointed in the nachos.  The food is above average.  The beer is cold.  The girls are pretty, and there are plenty of TVs.  We had a blast watching our games!  If I'm ever in Phoenix during an NFL weekend, I will return to the Tilted Kilt.",

We grab a table and a waitress comes over pretty quickly to get our order.  My friend was hungry so we asked about food but she informed us that the kitchen closed at midnight, it was about 12:08.  That was annoying because I just feel like if your establishment is open until 2:00 you should have the WHOLE thing open until 2:00am.  So once that was discovered we decided we were just gonna finish our drinks and look for somewhere that did serve food.  Unfortunately at this point our waitress had vanished.  We were looking around the whole bar (which again, was 90% empty) and couldn't find her anywhere.  After a while I finally spot her and made some serious eye contact until she figured out that we needed her.  The whole stop there felt like a waste of time and was accompanied by service that, while friendly, wasn't present when we needed it.",

We ordered a double order and he only brought one order. He said he didn't hear us which would be understandable except that he also messed up our sauce order twice. It seemed that his co bartender had no issues so it was probably just him. I really did like the wings. I had them plain with the sauce on the side. The signature kilt sauce was your average buffalo sauce and the sweet and spicy was also good (its not spicy though). I would eat here again just not with the same waiter.",

    "text": "I am new to Phoenix and literally live around the corner from this restaurant. I'm thinking \"Wow, great to have this place just around the corner.\" I couldn't have been more wrong. On arrival I sat at the bar which I prefer as service is usually more prompt. It was steady but not what you would call busy. The server Susie started out nice and friendly, promptly serving a diet coke as ordered. The diet coke tasted a bit funny so I double checked with her to make sure it was a diet coke. She offered to get me another from the other side of the restaurant so I said fine. Well, 5-10 minutes later she returned, sans diet coke, and said they were changing out the other line. She walked away and began serving other people and didn't bother to say if or when she would return with another drink. I should have realized at this point that things would only go south but I remained optimistic.  After about 5 minutes I managed to get her attention and politely asked her to just switch it out with iced tea.She dumped the diet coke and 10 minutes later -- nothing. She was on the other side of the bar, flirting with 2 gentleman who she obviously knew or waited on frequently. Finally the other bartender, Megan, came around and asked if she could help. I requested an iced tea which she promptly served me. She looked puzzled as she knew I had been there a while and had been waited on by Susie but she didn't say anything else. Susie finally pulled herself away from her \"friends\" and passed by me and noticed I had my iced tea. She simply said \" Oops, I forgot. I'm glad to see she (Megan) got your iced tea.\" No apology or \"I'm sorry\" ever came from her lips. Another 20 minutes passed by and I'm still waiting for the meal I ordered. Susie, in the meantime, is flirting with her customers, presumably showing off her ample cleavage in search of bigger tips. Megan passed by once more and asked how things were. I told her, politely, that the service was horrible and that Susie was not providing any type of decent customer service at all and that I had now been waiting for my food for 30 minutes. I explained that this was my first visit [and most likely my last]. Megan was very apologetic and went to check on my food. Finally, 10 minutes later I received my Shepard's Pie from Susie who pretty much ignored me from that point on. Thank goodness there was a spoon in it as I had not received any silverware. I reached over the counter myself to get the salt and pepper. 10 minutes went by and as Susie passed I asked her if they had any napkins at the bar. I mean really? Long story short, I waited way too long for my food in a not very busy restaurant. The main dish itself was OK but the Parmesan bread was very dry and tough. When you consider the terrible customer service and long wait it surely was not worth my time or money. I am so disappointed as I thought I might have found a good spot to eat after work since it's so close by but unfortunately this was not to be the case. I'm thinking, having sat at the bar, maybe if I had ordered a higher profit item such as beer or liquor I might have gotten better service?? I guess I'll never find out :(",

It was going to get worse.  The Bud Light arrived.  In plastic cups.  Really?  Well I guess what can you expect for only $7?  Yes, seven dollars for Bud Light in a plastic cup. Service continued to be slow, but the calamari finally arrived.  Pretty average stuff, but acceptable.  Unfortunately no napkins. We finally tracked down our server and begged some napkins. No silverware though. The rest of our meal arrived.  Food was okay.  All in all we spent $50 for two beers and two entrees (our companions had the calamari). But we did get the nice Plastic cups and I suppose we could have taken them home as souvenirs. Perhaps the restaurant didn't realize the super bowl was over and it was time to quit gouging the patrons, but if you are gonna charge $7 for a bud light at least put it in a proper glass and have decent service. We felt like we were taken advantage of and taken for granted. For now this place is off the list and we will be heading for that other nearby local Irish spot.  Very disappointing.",

    "text": "Myself and some friends were downtown for a concert and stopped in for a couple beers before the show. There were also some NCAA basketball games on as it is March so it was extremely busy. That being said, the establishment was very ill-prepared and the staff was incredibly overwhelmed. Management is to blame for this one and needs to prepare better for busy nights. The bar was four deep on all four sides and there was not an empty seat in the house. I certainly don't mind waiting my turn for a beer, but I definitely don't want to stand there for 15 minutes without even being acknowledged as four different bartenders walk past me at least three times each without even making eye contact. I get busy and it was, I assure you, but come on Tilted Kilt. You are in the service industry and one of the most basic rules of thumb in that industry is to acknowledge people that may have to wait a moment so that they know you see them there and it helps them relax knowing you will be back. To management: wake up and look at a calendar of events and staff appropriately! Your staff was almost doing the best they could...minus the previous statements, but they were truly over run and over whelmed. Your service suffered because of this and there is hardly a better reason to not return to an eating/drinking establishment than bad service. In conclusion...the lengthy wait for a frosty beverage was more irritating than it should have been because it was for a stupid reason. Irritating enough to make me not want to return.",

The bar girls have outfits that would make Hooters girls blush, and the male waitstaff wear kilts, presumably for easy access with the aforementioned ladies, since creating even a shadow of authenticity to some old-world standard is clearly not the goal here.  This definitely was the place to watch the game though, and five stars to Tilted Kilt for playing host to the ridiculous, over-the-top passion that the American Outlaws bring to a soccer party. There was a guy with a drum leading chants, lots of bros decked out in whatever spandex they owned in red, white and blue, and a few founding fathers that presumably belong to those with dual memberships in American Outlaws and the Tea Party. Generally I had a jolly good time, and I couldn't ask for a better place to watch the USMNT kick ass.",

    "text": "After a couple of visits to Tilted Kilt Pub & Eatery, I think I've had my fill.  On my first visit with a group of friends, we were denied food because it was too close to the kitchen's closing time or something of that nature.  Frankly, given they were new to downtown Phoenix at the time and just beginning to build a clientele, so I was a bit surprised they turned away a party of about ten people.  No worries--we found another local place perfectly willing to accommodate us.  My more recent visit was just a couple of days ago; a party of two in the afternoon hours.  At first, the server seamed quick and attentive, but after serving drinks and entrees, disappeared.  We had to wait about 30 minutes after finishing our meals to get a carryout container, then she never brought the check.  So much for the service.  The food was mediocre.  I say that because my friend enjoyed the Pastrami Sandwich, my I didn't care for the Danny Boy's Shepherd's Pie at all.  The mashed potatoes had the texture of cardboard and the mystery meat had no flavor of beef.  I guess the two meals averaged out to \"mediocre.\"  Of course, the absentee server might have known that if she bothered to check back with us.  I don't ask for much --- I really don't.  I never send my food back, but is dropping $50 on two entrees and two drinks in exchange for discernible food and a server who doesn't forget you exists too much to ask for?  :::Sigh:::   Oh, and I like to be able to hear the game on tv as much as anyone else, but PLEASE turn it down a notch so I can hear the person sitting two feet away from me speak.",

Then waited around 10 minutes for the waitress to finally acknowledge us. We ordered pina coladas but what we got was basically ice blended with some colada mix. It tasted like watered down pineapple juice. Around 10 minutes later I had to signal our waitress. She argued and insisted that it was a pina colada. She finally took the drinks back to be remade. 10 minutes or so passed and she had still had no interest in taking our order. Instead she was chatting with the bartender and a group at the bar. We got tired of waiting and decided to leave. We went to Copper Blues instead. The service was poor and frankly so was the waitresses attitude. I will never be coming again.",

If it wasn't for her excellence in trying to make our experience as best as possible, I would give this review probably 3 stars.

The place wasn't busy by any means and we were properly greeted at the door by 4 servers who were mingling at the front desk area.  We were seated at a high-top between the from door and the bar.    A waitress came over, dropped off menus and took our drink order.  She returned with the drinks then rejoined her colleagues chatting and cell phoning at the front desk.    Drink 1 finished and no return trip to our table to refill or take our order.  Waiting...finally, I had to get up and go to the front desk to ask if we could order food.  Waitress came over and we ordered.  We waited and waited for food to arrive and finally had to get up again, go to the front desk and asked our waitress if our food was ready.  She went to the kitchen and low and behold, our food was sitting there waiting for someone to serve.  After delivering, she returned to her chat at the front desk.  To get a drink refill and our check required trips 3 & 4 to go get our waitress to give us some attention.  The food was good but I have to say that they really need to do a better job training their pretty lasses about how to serve.  Her tip reflected the lack of effort she gave.",

I say that with the preconceived notion that your expecting bar food when you walk into this establishment.  Lets be honest with what the concept behind Tilted Kilt is, A sports bar for men that 1UPs hooters.  I absolutely can't stand hooters food and regular bar food can be a bit dingy or greasy in most cases. Tilted Kilt offers a much broader menu than most with salads, sandwiches, full entrees, you name it. As lame as it sounds, my go to is the Chicken Tender basket with no sauce, it comes with Cheyenne Ranch and the chicken is lightly breaded. It has the right about of spicy for me at lunch and doesn't over stuff me when I need to get back to work.   Other suggestions would be the drunken clams appetizer or the Fish Tacos, they hit the spot too.   Yes, some servers can be hit or miss, but feel like that happens any where you go these days.  I take it with a grain a salt I guess. But my overall response and feedback on this place is that they are an excellent sports bar that beats out Hooters, I don't think they are trying to be anything else than that.",

Now I can get over this because that is the way these things work. You usually have little to no warning when the mix goes bad but it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to get me a new drink. The sandwich was not good either...the French/ Irish dip was totally bland. The au jus had a little flavor which helped me choke it down but I'd never order it again. Our waitress was nice even though she was completely overwhelmed but a couple of the other servers looked downright pissed off and mean.   This establishment will probably be very profitable because of its location within CityScape. The alcohol sales alone will probably be enough to keep it in the black. If I ever go back it will be for adult beverages only. I'd rather get a hot dog at Chase or US Airways.  At least the boobies are fun to look at.",

She snapped and said \"Uhh.. thats how pina coladas are suppose to taste like..\" she just grabbed our drinks and didn't even apologized for the inconvenience. We were waiting at the table, waiting for her to give us service, she didn't even acknowledge us and talked with the bartender instead. So we just left and never going back again. Horrible service from the waitress. Recommend anyone to hopefully not get Kenzie as their waitress and to just go to another location or any restaurants really around downtown.",

We were ignored for awhile, finally a waitress came,  our food took over an hour and when it came it was cold.  I had a bean burrito, it was overly salty, cold,  and even though I was super hungry,  I couldn't bare to eat it.   It came with sweet potato fries that were still frozen in the center.  All of this for like $12.00.... place is kind of a rip-off, and since I am a female,  the girls in short skirts, and big boobs doesn't make up for crap food, and crap service.  The waitresses tried to be nice, but I think someone is training them to be overly annoying,  they sit down at our table to take our order and kept talking to us...

But of course, the food as expected isn't all that great, but the ladies are shall I say, have nice outfits and truly warm up to you.  Cheers to ASU.  Heck, you even get a collectors card to take home and show your wife and kids.    For the upside, at least it made my trip to Tempe somewhat memorable, even though it required venturing outside to Phoenix for a drink and grub.  Just a 30 min travel away and 2 transfers.    For the food:  -Garlic Fries - bleh, although its the skinnier type fries, no one does it better than Gordon Biersch  -Spinach Dip - bland and too chunky  -Grilled Buffalo Wings - I got like 3 that were burnt, and although its supposedly different from the deep fried type, they were just like the ones you cook on the bbq, except .....more burnt.  I didn't enjoy it that much I had myself to blame since I was craving wings for some reason.  -Side of Dublin Stew - Probably the one thing I'm glad I got since it was sort of like a Shepards Pie in stew form.  Tasty and pretty filling.  As for the drinks:  -After all, the bar was just calling out to me and although I had hoped to see more beers on tap, unfortunately, a majority of their beer list was bottled.  I went with the Kilt Lifter...something that sounded rather appropriate which turned out to be like an IPA but toned down and had a sweeter taste like that of a Hef.",

It was my boyfriend's birthday on St. Patrick's Day and I had paid online for tickets to get in to the street party.  By the time we got there that evening they were letting people in for free so the money I could have spent on food and drinks went to tickets I didn't need.  A manager, I think his name was Joe, was very accommodating and escorted our party to the VIP section.  The drinks at the bar were twice the size of any drink I've gotten at any party I've been at before and the bartenders were fun and lively even though it was cold and windy outside.  I really appreciated the effort that was made by all the staff to make sure everyone enjoyed themselves at the street party even though it was so cold and so many people were leaving because of the cold.",

Every table is assigned two servers, all comely young ladies in short plaid skirts (SO not kilts) and bras with white shirts tied above the midriff.  They're all really cute and friendly, to be sure, but I don't -- repeat DO NOT -- want them to SIT DOWN at my table and stay, making lame conversation.    (before you call me a prude, I *like* going to strip clubs, they're honest and call it what it is.  I don't want to be confused about whether I'm in sport bar or a gentleman's club...)  There were literally 100 servers on the floor on a Saturday late afternoon.  It was impossible to have a conversation or watch the game, because the Gemini Twin Barbie servers wouldn't leave us alone.  We were most amused at the old couple who looked like they were in from Wisconsin for the All Star game, looking both bemused and alarmed that their two servers just plopped down at their table and watched them eat.    Honestly, the damnedest thing I've ever seen.  If you're alone and lonely or you want to go look at some boobs without the cost and stigma of the strip clubs, this is the place for sure.  If you just want a beer, conversation, or to watch the game, you really need to find somewhere else to go.  Ick.  Just ick....",

    "text": "The Tilted Kilt 2 E. Jefferson Phoenix, AZ Assorted Locations in the Phoenix area and other states  The Tilted Kilt is one of those gregarious sports bars that tries to emulate a pub in some ways and yet be a sports bar in other ways. Somehow, they are successful. The decor is that of a typical sports bar with televisions hung all over the place, and, at least at the beginning of the lunch shift had music blasting so loud that one could not hear one's self much less even hear a cell phone ring.   This location is upstairs, and the elevator (important for those who are handicapped) hasn't worked since opening day.   Upon entering, I was greeted and seated promptly at the table of my choosing. Companion had not arrived yet, and I ordered Irish Nacho's ($6.99) to help pass the time. This was unique! Instead of typical tortilla chips, this was served on thick, slices of potato, fried to a golden brown and beautiful crunch. The spice and mild heat, instead of typically being in the cheese, was instead in the meat making for a nice surprise, and the dish was garnished with fresh tomato concasse.  Perhaps the only problem with this dish is that like the famous potato chip in a bag, you can't eat just one! You will eat until there is nothing but an empty basket left! Other appetizers available include classic nachos ($8.99), spinach and artichoke dip ($6.99) and Mozzarella Sticks ($7.99)  The last time I was at the Tilted Kilt I ordered the Shepherds' pie ($9.99) and found it to very good. Companion had the Gaelic Chicken ($11.99) and sent back a plate so clean that it could have been put back into stock accidentally. This time, I ordered the Irish Stew (a bargain @ $6.99). It arrived nice and hot as a moat around a pile of colcannon potatoes with cheese sprinkled on top. The meat was almost falling apart, and the taste was wonderfully savory. Many places like this will put lots of salt into the dish, but thankfully, the chef did not do that here, allowing the customer to salt and pepper the food to taste - a nice touch. The dish arrived with some nicely toasted garlic bread as an accompaniment.  Companion had the Pulled Pork sandwich, and was a bit disappointed. The meat was nicely done, and the brioche roll was an excellent choice to serve it on as it kept the contents in the sandwich instead of running down your hand, but the sauce was woefully short of promise. The sauce, which could have really made the sandwich special was nothing but an ordinary barbeque sauce that tasted like something off the grocery shelf. It lent no character to the dish, and in some ways took away from what would otherwise have been a nice sandwich. The pulled pork was crying for some smoky sauce perhaps with a touch of spice in it to bring the meal up to it's full potential. The sandwich was served with fries which were nicely done and not overly seasoned.  Other items available are Bleu cheese steak salad ($12.99), Huge burgers (10 oz. cooked to order (starting at $8.99), Fish and Chips ($10.99) and Fat Bastards Meatloaf Sandwich with Guiness sauce ($9.99).  For dessert, we shared a slice of cheesecake ($5.99). As with many places, the cheesecake tasted like it was brought in from an outside bakery, though in flavor it was quite nice. The disappointment was the whipped cream, or what some might think would pass for whipped cream. I was sure it was nothing more than the metal can with the squirt top that one buys in the local supermarket - light cream foamed up to make you think It's whipped cream. It had none of the denseness nor mouth feel of real whipped cream. Dessert would have been much better had they left it off the plate so as to not detract from the Cheesecake.  Over all, the service was attentive without being intrusive. Our waitress checked on our satisfaction several times, refilled drinks without being asked, and in general was quite helpful and nice. Our table was bussed promptly.   Sanitation was excellent with bathrooms almost having a homey feel to them and being well stocked and immaculately clean.  I rate this restaurant 4 stars based on quality of food, portion size to cost, and excellent sanitation.",

It's one of those novelty- themed sports bars where a guy goes for standard brew and some mediocre chow to fill some kind of psychological void while watching a game.     Not a romantic date place, for sure, and not so much fun for the family with kids, either, unless one takes a bunch of boys here to celebrate their bar mitzvahs.   I went because my Love so desperately wanted to see Sunday football someplace different than Zipps, while I desperately wanted to have gourmet food and go shopping at a mall.     Might as well drop your man off at this sports bar which can serve as a sort of day care center, while the ladies make a run to the mall, otherwise, one is better off to go the local sports bar (unless you want to shell out extra mulah) for standard food and TV fare.",

Nothing to write home about. Don't get me wrong there was nothing wrong with it. The burger came out on a busy, BUSY night prepared as requested (medium) & hot. Everything we ordered came out & no weirdness. I just wasn't a fan of the food. The atmosphere was fun & yes the server had a killer bod. We'll be back for happy hour & try some other stuff but the food so far mediocre. Happy hour pricing & atmosphere will make it or break it for me next time. Stay tuned!",

    "text": "It should have told me something when, during prime bar time on a Saturday night the place had plenty of empty tables.  It should have told me something when, those tables were empty right after a sporting event across the street at US Airways Center  It should have told me something that those tables were empty on a Saturday night, right after a sporting event, AND it was St. Patrick's Day.  HUH?  They can't even fill a downtown bar on St. Patrick's Day on a Saturday night after a sporting event next-door?  Of course, if I had read the reviews here I wouldn't have tried Tilted Kilt in the first place.  The first clue was when one of our group of six, a female, went to the rest room and pronounced it \"gross\".  The second clue was the fact that they didn't quite get the fact that they are supposed to be an Irish pub and this was St. Patrick's Day.  The third clue was how they didn't even seem to have a theme, only a very weak imitation of Hooters (I am not a fan of Hooters).  Our waitress was actually pretty good.  It was easy for the 6 of us to find a vacant table and she was with us in a few minutes.  She recommended a bomb of a tiny bit of liquor and about 1/8 of a glass of beer.  No wonder she was so enthusiastic about it, they were $17 each (Tilted Kilt does NOT post prices anywhere).  We had eaten at the arena so we ordered sweet potato fries.  That was the only food we had so I can't rate anything else on the menu but they were REALLY bad, something dumped out of a frozen food bag.  Being a Saturday night, prime time, on St. Patrick's Day do you think there would be some entertainment?  No. Only canned music  Not even a touch of green to mark the day.  Is this place the McDonald's of Hooter lookalike bars?  Here is the ultimate insult, though.  One of the drinks I ordered was a Maker's Mark Manhattan.  Now, Maker's Mark is a very premium (and expensive) brand.  Any bar in the world would serve it in a nice glass.  What did Tilted Kilt serve it in?  A tiny plastic dixie cup.  Really?  Really!!!  Okay, now I see why there were so few customers and why the reviews here are so bad.  There is absolutely nothing Tilted Kilt offers to even deserve a first visit.",

From what I do remember from that night is that I had an insane amount of Car Bomb's (Tilted calls them something else on the menu.  Why?)  Hey, I wasn't paying for them.  Service was good, they did a good job to keep the inebriation train a rollin'.  Relax, none of us were driving.  Walking back to the hotel was fun though.  I also seem to recall that they did last call at 10pm... really?  Oh, I see why, they use Michael Collins instead of Jameson's... very nice.",

We've been going here because of Phoenix Comicon meetings we have downtown.  Which is awesome this place opened up..  Because last year we went to Majerles almost every day for lunch for Phoenix Comicon.  THIS will be our new place to hang out.    The food is great.  If you love sweet potato fries.. holy crap, you will love theirs.  Amazing!  The waitresses are wonderful and treat you with the most respect.  Of course they are eye candy and make the Hooter girls seem like nothing. TK knows how to hire beauty.  Even the guys are GQ quality.  Treat them with respect and you get it back. (meaning no oogling to the point you fall out of your chair) So I guess that's why we have a good time there. Drinks are plentiful and management always comes around to make sure you're doing well.    Just love this place and the atmosphere.  TIP: If you want an amazing view of the city, sit outside on the balcony!",

I called about a week advance and they said, even though they don't usually take reservations, they would set us up with the party room for the time we requested.  Everything ended up going about as well as possible. The waitresses did an excellent job and they were very organized. Everyone got their checks separated and in an orderly fashion. One person's order got messed up and they were able to get something else and weren't charged for the meal. Everyone else enjoyed their food and the staff was very good about getting an extra table and chairs in there when we needed them.  I just wanted to say that I had a tremendous time and I was extremely satisfied. Thank you Tilted Kilt for accommodating us!",

He wanted to choose and he decided on this place.  I had actually never heard of a Tilted Kilt pub and didn't know what to expect except for pub food and drinks.   I was partially correct.  I was surprised to see the outfits, but I'm no prude so it doesn't bother me any.  What I liked most about the outfits and the people wearing them was their attitudes.  Sometimes in places like these, and perhaps because the women will be treated poorly, they have huge attitudes.  Not here!  They were all very attractive, and welcoming.  Their friendliness, and timeliness was wonderful.  We were never left alone for too long, they always returned promptly with a smile and our drink or food, continued to check on us, answer questions and were very knowledgeable about the food and drinks.  I was pretty surprised at our servers knowledge of different whiskey too!  We ordered some beers which were recommended by our waitress, they were very good and refreshing, we also got the deep fried pickles which were done just right and had the perfect crunch and flavor, split some chicken wrap which was decent and shared a spinach salad that had cranberries, bacon, egg and some other stuff on it, this was the best.  Everything went well together and complemented each other.  I would come back again, perhaps try some burgers which I saw at the table next to me, they looked great!",

My hotel was actually only two doors down from this location so can you say super score?!   Upon arrival my co-workers and I walked in to what we thought was going to be a long wait time but To our surprise  it wasn't so we were thankfully seated immediately. The luck didn't stop there though JR turns out that we showed up right at the start of happy hour so that automatically gives a few more brownie points!   The weather was great so of course we took advantage of being seated outside on the rooftop! Not sure if there was a game or something going on but it was pretty busy down by the arena so people watching was defiantly fun!  Once our waitress arrived to take our drink orders I couldn't wait to put in my request to use the yelp check in offer for free fried pickles! Along with that we took a round of margaritas, and added some chili con queso to our appetizers! The fish tacos happened to be on the happy hour menu so I went with those as my actual entree lol. For $7 it was very well worth it! Usually fish tacos aren't very filling but my plate came out with 3 nice size tacos that did more than fill me up!   Overall the experience was pretty good! Minus the situation with one of my co-workers burgers coming out not done enough, Service was great!",

The BBQ wings I got were amazing and the Celtic knot me and my friend shared was delicious. My friends both had Ceaser Salads and said they were terrific. And they both had alcoholic drinks a total of three among them that they both loved the taste of all three of them so much that they had to take pictures of the ingredients list of the drinks so they might be able to make them themselves at home later. While since I don't drink alcohol I got a Mr. Pib and I haven't had one of those taste good in a really long time but this place had the carbonation to syrup ratio just right it tasted amazing and believe me I drink a lot of different soda's and I would almost go back to this place just for the soda alone but it's best to go with friends so it's more fun.",

    "text": "Happiness - 3.5/5 Deliciousness - 2/5  This place has a great location, beautiful wait staff (both guys and girls), and a great view of downtown Phoenix. But there really isn't much to offer beyond that.   I came for happy hour and almost everything was still $8+. That's pretty steep for brand name beer and bland food. The place was definitely not busy, but the wait staff mainly talked with each other and didn't really  provide fast or attentive service. For example, it took me about 5 minutes to get the bartender to bring me a second beer after finishing my first (while I was sitting at the bar).   I wish the food and service was better as I love the location and the vibe. But with so many options downtown, I just don't think Tilted Kilt gives the best bang for the buck.",

The tots were crunchy and loaded with cheese, sauerkraut, bits of corned beef, and topped with green onions. Totally the bomb! Then hubby and I decided to split the Boston Burger. It was delish - cooked perfectly with crispy bacon and an onion relish that totally made the burger rock. Our server was great! Very attentive and super friendly and nice. Will totally return another day!",

Tilted Kilt answered our phone call quickly and accurately. Once we got there, we got seated right away and all servers were friendly...specially because one of my friends spilled water everywhere and we had to switch tables.   The minus 2 stars comes from the food. Yes, we expected bar food, and although the taste was good (particularly the fried pickles & loaded tots), the food didn't sit well with any of our stomachs.   Although the service was great, all of us getting sick left a sour taste in our mouths.",

My father and I stopped in to eat on a Saturday afternoon around 3pm to eat before we went to the Dbacks game at 5. It was nowhere near as busy as it usually is before games at Chase Field, but it wasn't empty or anything. When we walked in there was no one at the hostess stand and we waited for over 5 minutes for someone to finally come and show us to a table, after waiting another few minutes at the table the hostess came back with menus and told us that a waitress would be with us shortly. After waiting about 15 minutes and watching several servers walk by completely ignoring us, we got up and left, I was going to comment about their horrible service as we left, but as we walked out there was no one at the hostess stand but another group of guys waiting to be seated!! Horrible service!!!",

It was unexpected that I would rate it 2 stars. Let me explain: We sat at the bar where we thought would get the quicker service. It was crowded but not unbearable and there were definitely still seats open. The waitress at the bar greeted us and asked what we'd like to drink. After our first drink, it was a complete switch. She did not check on us and we told her that we would like to order some food. She did not take our orders until 20 mins later and I'm not exaggerating because I looked at the clock and didn't want to miss the start of the game. Her co-worker had to tell her TWICE that we are waiting to put in our food order. She skipped us and went to every other people next to us to get their order in. We weren't being rude and we didn't know what we did wrong. She finally took our orders in and did not talk to us until we asked for our bill. I was disappointed because I really liked their wings--- I ordered the boneless wings with Thai Sweet Chili sauce and a glass of Angry Orchard.  Will I come back to this location? Probably not.",

I like to go here regularly before suns games and when I go to the comicons at the convention center. I lost my car downtown and they let me sit in the restaraunt and offered to charge my phone and the waitress spent a few minutes to talk to me. Plus on St Patrick day they had a special menu and the waitress gave me some green beads I could wear before I went over to watch the suns and golden state. Thank you and I will be returning before the next suns game. Shay is also an awesome waitress. She should be a therapist lol she listened to my problems and I wasn't even drunk. I was just a lonely loser eating fried pickles.   Update: Mone is an awesome waitress. She has waited on me before and has been very helpful so shout-out to her. Abby was super awesome too. She was running around doing 4 tables.!Alexis is always helpful as well always waiting on me",

Until one day the manager saw it fit to scold me infront of my guest and retract further use of the Yelp check in offer.

He said he would and that was fine.  I work in Queen Creek and drove the 40 miles into downtown Phoenix after work on Monday and skipped a meeting for my own child. I got there, and Robin the GM told me Danny, her assistant manager, had taken the cards to Chase Bank Friday morning to shred them all, including mine. I was MAD.  I spent gas money to get there and Danny assured me he'd hold it for me. I had to cancel all of my online transactions, too.  Robin the GM said it was Danny's fault, asked for my cell # and promised he'd call to fix it. It is TWO WEEKS LATER now and no call... ever. I am not happy. A comped meal to make up for gas money would've been nice, atleast.  Had Robin the GM known that I have the ear of the people who run Phoenix Comicon that brings over 6,000 customers into the area, perhaps Danny would've called me back. They now have the chance to lose a lot more business. People need to be fair to each other. It was my fault I forgot the card but they promised to keep it til Monday and then later promised to fix it - they did neither.",

    "text": "Funny to see a couple of the recent reviews be for visitors when the WWE Royal Rumble was in town, as they seemed to be on their A-game that day compared to other reviews. But perhaps not their A \"talent\". Think of the Tilted Kilt as a Scotish version of Hooters with girls in provocative school girl outfits. Sounded good to me ... except I'd seen better talent at the Hooters in Manassas. Downtown Phoenix, you can do better than that!  They had a great vibe going before the Royal Rumble. Looking for our second spot to drink, my friend and I decided to try the Tilted Kilt because of proximity to the arena and high probability of good beer. When we approached, we saw a line forming out front and I immediately sensed this was a hot pre-Rumble spot. We moved through the crowded restaurant to the exterior bar area and, sure enough, it was the WWE Universe, right in your face.  It was a great pre-event atmosphere. Ample space outside to handle the crowds, a great vibe of people gathering from all over the world for a common event and interest, and solid service at a crowded \"college bar\" type of atmosphere. And the beer selection was pretty good. I think it was about 25 brews and reminded me of a Buffalo Wild Wings type of selection - heavy on the national \"microbrews\" like Sam Adams and Blue Moon, and the big name InBev imports. They did feature four beers from Four Peaks, a Tempe-based brewery that I saw everywhere in Phoenix. And the Hoegaarden was a nice touch. It's the beer that Blue Moon tried to copy, but failed miserably. It reminded me how much I love Hoegaarden (and despise Blue Moon)  I have a feeling my review would be different if I ate here ... this looks like one of those chainy food factories where everything would be bland and indistinguishable. But rating solely on the beer, service, and experience - 4 stars is deserved.",

I walked in when it opened and you can tell she had to do the prep for the day and she handled it like a champ.  I had the TK's Signature Wings - Kilt Burner Sauce, which wasn't that hot. I was expecting an explosion of burning goodness. They were still delectable, but I wanted HOT!!   Anyway, the view of Suzie was absolutely easy on the eyes. She is absolutely gorgeous! I would go back just to have her service. :-)  A great beer selection on tap also made this a good spot to eat lunch/ drink lunch.",

You go to this place to watch sports, glance at pretty young girls in revealing outfits and drink beer. There shouldn't be any surprises, haha.  Pros: Lots of beers, great views of TV's pretty much everywhere with sound, convenient location if you're downtown, lots of pretty girls in skimpy clothing, great apps and snacks, the entrees are hit or miss.  Cons: Service isn't super fast but it's not bad. Prices could be better and have more specials/happy hour.  Will definitely go again in any city that has one if there's a game on.",

    "text": "Visited 5.27.2012 (@2:45pm)  This is only the second time that I have eaten at this location and my boyfriend and I had pretty terrible service.  When we walked and asked if we could sit outside the hostess handed us menus and told us to sit wherever.  So we did. We sat there for about 15 minutes.  A few waitresses smiled at us but no one asked if we had been helped.   Finally, a waitress came over who didn't know the price differences between domestic or foreign beer - only new the specials.  Then she left to find out how much a Kiltlifter draft would be - $6 (kind of pricey) but my boyfriend ordered one anyways.  I ordered a bloody mary.  The drinks seemed to take a long time and the waitress explained that my bloody mary was what was holding things up. Truthfully it wasn't busy at all and the bartender should have had no problems pouring a draft beer and mixing vodka with bloody mary mix pretty quickly.  When the drinks came (brought by a different waitress) there were no garnishments for my drink.  I had to get up to get my own (no bloody mary bar either).  The food came, again from a different waitress, but we had no napkins or silverwear.  I stole one off of the table next to us and went in for another. When I asked the bartender - he told (rather rudely) a waitress to \"get her a place setting.\"  I was really appalled by the way he spoke to her.  We started eating and the original waitress stopped by to see how our meal was and the food was pretty good so we both said good.    When the bill came I was pretty disappointed that the waitress did not inform us that there would be an up-charge for sweet potato fries.  So his burger and my Caesar chicken wrap were $13 each.   Having been to many downtown restaurants where I have received great service I could not let this experience go by without saying something.  I regret not saying something at the time but the staff didn't seem to appreciate our patronage in the first place.  Go to Arrogant Butcher if it is open instead.  S~",

I've had to be a patron of this particular TK recently because it is one of the few restaurants downtown that can handle a large group, which is a shame. That said, the food isn't awful, and the beer is kept flowing. So, if you're going for the purpose of hanging out with a group, it's not the worst option out there.  The food is okay, the service can be hit or miss, and the beer selection isn't that bad. This location is definitely one of the better TK's out there, so go...as long as you know what you're going there for. And yes, I'm talking to you, critical foodie. ;)",

Huge gaps between her visits.  Some more bus boys to keep the drinks fresh and troubleshoot would have helped alot.  The food was good.  I had a burger that was tasty and perfect fries.  The ale was super.  Lots of drinks to choose from.  Ambience.  If you are into sports there are tons of TVs and blaring sports sounds. Not my cup of tea.... but then again .... the waitresses give you plenty of ....shall we say... other things to look at besides the lame sports offerings.",

What a surprise to walk in starving with my colleagues (with only a short hour til our conference) and be served by girls in tube tops and mini skirts awwwwwwwk!  Anyhow, the Tilted Kilt Pub had a Yelp special where it offered free deep fried pickles if you checked in. I had never had before! I also had the chicken wings in the barbecue Guinness flavor. They were a large portion and came with fries. Yummm. Honestly, they tasted like regular barbecue. The deep fried pickles were good but these were a little salty. They were soooo addicting.   It goes without saying, the Tilted Kilt was an experience!!! haha",

I got the boneless wings and they were so stretchy and chewy it was unappetizing. One friend got chips and dip, the salsa did not taste fresh  at all, tasted watered down. The guac was a sad paste also missing flavor. Then the other person with us ordered her burger well done and halfway through we noticed there was a lot of pink. The waitresses also didn't check on us and forgot our ranch for the longest. Also I'm usually not picky with water even tap water but this one specifically also didn't taste well. Overall never coming back, there's other better restaurants I recommend heading to them.",

You might be OK at a place where the girls have various body parts falling out of their clothes. This just isn't my thing, and I would never come here normally, but everyone else in my party was fine with the idea or they were hungry and thirsty.    Our waitress arrived quickly to our table, and I ordered an Irish cider that was excellent (not on draft but still very good) and our table ordered a sampler platter. After well past the time when our food should have arrived, we asked our waitress what happened to the platter. She let us know that it was given to another table (who hadn't ordered food--lucky them) by another waitress, but that she had put a rush order on another one, well, for us. Hmmm.  When the sampler platter did arrive, the onion rings were very good. The chicken wings had a spice level of 5, so they immediately burnt my lips. If you can handle spicy food, go ahead and order the level 5 burn. The tater tots had an unusual sauce that wasn't to my liking, but the mozzarella sticks were great, especially when dipped into one of the three sauces that was served with the platter.  I probably won't be back unless it's the only place open, and peer pressure makes me do it.",

    "text": "What in the heck happened to Tilted Kilt!??? Their menu used to be enormous, with an abundance of different kinds of foods. Now they have a small list that is geared more towards \"Irish\" dishes. I am not quite sure what they were trying to accomplish when they changed the menu. Make it easier on the kitchen staff? I think poor decision. The food now is horrible. I order their nachos (hoping it was their old plated nachos which were piled high with nothing but delicious goodness) but nope..... I got chip/nachos with store melted cheese (which was cold) and a few pieces of tiny bits of meat? Think 3 dollops of cheese and half a cup of tiny pieces of meat. How can you call those nachos? I was so confused. My husband and I were in Phoenix for a show, so we were in a hurry. I asked the waitress if I could order something else because the chips were stale, it was cold and it had nothing to it. It was worse than cafeteria food at my son's elementary school. She never came back to the table. I was starving, so I ate a few and slid them over to the edge of the table. Luckily I married the most wonderful man in the world, and even though he was also starving, he shared his food with me. We also ordered 2 drinks from the bar, and the waitress told us that since it was packed, it would be a while. We got our drinks 40 minutes later, had already finished eating, downed them and hurried and paid the bill. I am finding a new place for my go-to before a show in Phoenix.",

After our server took our drink order (which took 10 minutes to get after ordering) we never saw her again. Ok, that's not completely True. I saw her walk around and talk with other staff, but she never came back. After nearly being in the restaurant for 40 minutes with no food or service, my friend and I got up and left.

For a Saturday evening, the Tilted Kilt was not exactly humming. There were a few tables being used and a number of patrons at the bar. There seemed to be only a few waitresses working, but they did not seem overly busy.  The atmosphere was pleasantly relaxed as the crowd was not overly rowdy, actually not rowdy at all.  The food was quite good and the drinks were as expected, cold and tasty.  If you are just going to ogle the waitstaff, you probably won't be disappointed.",

We left the D-backs game in the 7th inning before the rush and started off with some pretty attentive service. As soon as the game was over, the place started to fill up and the two waitresses working became overwhelmed and getting drunk refills were tough to come by.  Not too shabby on the bar food. A pound of wings and fries were a pretty good pick. I liked the Asian glaze flavor more than the garlic Parmesan, surprisingly. A friend in the group had chicken tenders that I thought were good. We did check in on Yelp and while the check in offer is only good during lunch, they still honored a complimentary appetizer of fried pickles... and they were pretty darn good.  Definitely a good spot to catch some sports. Decent food. A little iffy on service. But can you imagine this place on St. Patrick's Day? Nuts!?!?",

This place might be amazing if you are a woman, I wouldn't know, but I hear the hot guys in kilts there can't be beat anywhere downtown?  Maybe the place to take your BF to show him you're open minded, while drooling over the bartender? The guys In kilts are friendly, cool, and make me feel a bit like I need to get to the gym.  Honestly, it's probably better for women than men, because the guys on staff are good looking built enough to make me extremely jealous. The female staff is about what you would expect at a out of the way Hooters in the middle of nowhere or something, only with more tattoos.  They are in the \"decent, but debatable if I'd even date that\" category.  The food is debatable.  It's a traditional UK'ish menu, which isn't a bad thing.  But it depends on how it's prepared, so when the right cook is working it's brilliant, and worth every penny.  When the wrong cook is working, it might as well be microwaved frozen food.  Honestly, if you at CityScape already and are a guy just looking to see hot staff, you are probably better off at Copper Blues or Gypsy Bar.   But, the female staff is friendlier at the other bars in CityScape.  At Tilted Kilt the female staff sort of act like they hate the fact they are wearing those outfits and hate the fact they have to serve you.  Not a good thing for a theme restaurant.",

The servers are friendly and attentive.  The food was so/so.  The event hosts had self-serve Nachos, Flatbread, and Wraps.  It was above average for an event like this.  I want to come back and try something from the real menu.  There's a small patio that overlooks 1st St and Jefferson.  Too bad there's not much of a regular nightlife scene in downtown Phoenix, otherwise this could be a hot spot.  This is definitely on my list of pre-party joints before a Suns game.

Asked about beers on tap, what was local, etc waitress didn't know, left for what felt like 10 minutes only to tell us she wasn't sure.  Food was plain, nothing special to rave about. Our waitress was sweet but everything else lacked. This was my first time at any Tilted Kilt and probably my last.",

    "text": "With the risk of pissing someone off or getting my ass kicked by a large Irish/Scottish gent, I must say, in America, KILTS ARE WEIRD ON MEN. Having said that, the ladies look ok with their pushed up and out boobies.  The food is average at Tilted Kilt. The Shepard's Pie looked as if someone vomited on my mashed potatoes. On the other hand, the wings are VERY good. Especially the grilled wings.  Tilted Kilt has a great selection of beer on tap.  The service was mostly pleasant. I'm guessing management encourages a fun work environment, but that creates a lot of staff conversations. As customers, we don't need our hand held or non stop attention, but customer awareness leads to quality service.  Tilted Kilt has many tv's. During the World Series, the game sound was audible 2 out of the 4 nights visited. Kind of a bummer not to hear sound for such a big sporting event. They played music during Monday Night Football.  As you can see, I'm back and forth...thus giving Tilted Kilt 3 stars.",

    "text": "Visited 5/11/13.  Tilted Kilt is a typical bar type restaurant.  They have a nice selection of draft beers.  And typical bar food.  In fact, on this visit, my food was less than quality. I had the open meat loaf sandwich. It was not very filling and I was not impressed with the meat loaf.   It is in a nice location next to both US Airways Arena and Chase Ball Park. Nice location to meet for a quick burger and beer before a game.   My main reason for this review is to compliment the service, or management during this specific day.  And the reason for the fourth star....  With a group of guys for a day at the ball game.  On first round of drinks, waitress spilled beer down my back while serving. She was carrying too much to handle and trying to reach across and set glass down. Lost control of her tray and the result was a beer bath.  Of course I was in my game jersey...  The waitress response was less than quality. After cleaning up the spill and delivering a new beer, her only response was to ask if there was \"anything else I needed.\"  At that point, it was time to talk with the manager...  I wish I could remember the manager name... He told me, but I forgot...  But his response and service was exceptional.  Comp'd my meal and offered to give me a t-shirt from their store. But when he did not have my size, gave me money to by a new t-shirt at the ball park.  Only because of the manager response would I return. If it was left up to the waitress and her response, probably would not be back..",

    "text": "So I was on a bit of a side trip this past weekend and stopped in here with some friends from the area.  We were going to a sporting event in the area and decided to grab a bite before going into the game.  Not sure if the experience was just due to there being a sporting event around the corner or if this place is just this bad every day.  So lets start it off at the door.  Walked up to the hostess stand where three ladies in the bars outfit of short plaid skirts, white dress shirts open to show cleavage, and knee socks were standing around chatting it up about someones boy toy.  Took me a few minutes to get their attention.  I was then informed it was a wait for a table and handed a paging device to let me know when the table was ready.  Nothing else, no how many in the group, no suggestion to grab a drink at the bar, nothing.    OK.. so this is off to a bad start.  So the folks I am with and I decide to ignore the ladies at the hostess stand like they did to us and wandered over to the bar for a round of drinks.  This round was by far the best part of our visit to this establishment.  The bartender was a nice guy got us exactly what we ordered very quickly and even engaged us in some small talk for a bit as he delivered our round.  He also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service.  Wish I could remember his name to give him proper credit.  He is the only reason this visit did not end up with one star.  While we were standing there with the pager puck we could see three tables big enough for our group left uncleared for at least 15 minutes.   So after about a half hour the little pager puck starts blinking and we head back to the hostess stand.  Come to find out for our group of four the ladies put down a group of two.  Glad our whole group walked up there or we would have been squeezed into a postage stamp table.  First table the gentleman (I am guessing manager of some level) took us too was inside and the din was about deafening.  We asked for a table outside that we had seen that were left uncleared.  The gentleman seating us said he would check on those.  We followed him outside as he caught someones arm and had them clear and wipe off a table for us.  Our server showed up a few minutes after the manager/seater left and took our drink order and a appetizer order.  About ten minutes later she showed back up with half of the drink order and a promise to be right back with the rest of them.  Only bringing some things and broken promises are going to be common occurrences for the evening, but you will gather that in a few more lines.  So without the rest of the drink order and not the alcoholic ones those came out the first time, she came back to take our food order.  After she finished that we had to practically grab her arm to ask about the rest of the drinks to which she replied she would be right back with them.  Well 10 minutes later we flagged down a different waitress to get the rest of our drink order.  When the Appetizer came out it was good, we had the Irish nachos or whatever they were called.  Very good I thought, nice sized portion for our group.  Might be a bit much for a party of two.  No mention of the half of the drink order that we had to ask someone else for.  Not even an offer for refills, had to ask for those.  Refills came out about 15 minutes later with a promise that our dinner order was soon to be up.   Well 20 minutes after that we flagged down the Manager/seater gentleman as he was walking nearby and asked for refills and an update on when our dinner order was going to be out.  Should have kept an exact clock running on all of these visits as I am sure it was another 10 minutes at least before our waitress came by with one of the three refills requested, the alcoholic one of course and a promise that our dinner order was next up.  Fast forward another 15 minutes to a different waitress bringing out our food order and not the two other refills that we had asked for from the manager a half hour ago or so.  That waitress brought the lemonades right away and was apologetic.    Dinner was good.  Should have been after waiting the better part of an hour and a half to get it.  No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.   Overall, I don't think I will be back to this location.  Might try a different one and on a night that there isn't anything else going on to see if this type of service is the norm or just because of the events downtown.  In short ... Yelper Beware ... this is not a place to go if you have anything planned afterward unless you give yourself a few hours.",

Since we were already here we figured we might as well do dinner here where we more or less know what to expect as opposed to random concert venue fare at the location we were headed to. Megan was our witty server and I really appreciated her sense of humor considering these types of places usually hire servers for their looks even if they have as much wit as a box of rocks/bag of hammers or the personality of a doorknob. Megan was headline level talent and kept us entertained even when our food and drinks weren't matching her own delivery. She gave us the right amount of attention that we didn't even care or bother to time who got what when. Just like Mad Magazine she had snappy answers to stupid questions and if I can actually laugh out loud rather than fake a forced laugh at something a server says then this place at least made one good hire. I had the Samuel Adams Octoberfest - she recommended it and we all ended up getting it - no complaints about that. I ordered the Shepherds Pie. It was ok - edible but not especially memorable as I've had much better elsewhere. Really it was Megan that made the night here memorable more than the food or drink. Is that the way things should be? Hard to say because it doesn't happen too often. If you park in the cityscape parking structure Tilted Kilt will validate. Plenty of parking in the Cityscape parking lot - more so the later you come.",

Again, my previous comment stands - this place is what it is, and nobody comes here for a gastronomical adventure. Service is good.   Today's panegyric (yes, its a word) is to the manager of this place. We always give homage to the foot soldiers, and much deserved so - but today I want to let yelpers know that this beautiful girl is running a tight ship. It is clear that she takes her job seriously and personal, and dare I claim that she would take any complaint to heart and do what is within her power to fix it, if possible. I witnessed that today. That impressed me.   So to whatever-your-name-is-manager at this establishment. Nicely done.. and keep looking so confident. It motivates.",

Our appetizers made it before our drinks did and was tossed on our table like garbage by the runner who quickly left without giving us the opportunity to ask for plates, napkins, and silverware which took another 10 minutes to get. Spinach dip tasted like it just came out of the microwave and had zero flavor and the chips were just a pile of crumbs.  just plain gross! Drinks showed up in what could only be described as a cheap flimsy plastic cup you would get at a frat party. Food showed up and was inedible! My husband's Shepards pie had a disgusting gray color with what appeared to be under hydrated potatoes. To add insult to injury, I was charged $1.00 for ranch dressing that I had to ask for multiple times and didn't even show up until I was done eating. was too upset to complain about the dollar. Bathroom was covered in toilet paper and even had a wine glass on top of the toilet paper holder. I'll go to McDonald's next time!",

There was probably 1 maybe 2 girls i saw that looked decent enough to be wearing the outfit where you can't help but stare because her body is amazing! I had come with my bf his twin and 2 of their friends.  Thankfully we got a girl who had a nice body but not so great of a face so it worked out okay. As long as they aren't shaking their tits in my bfs face its  all good. But of course my luck failed me somewhat  because a girl definitely that should not be wearing the outfit with her stomach hanging over her skirt shook my bfs mixed drink in a little jar called \"the big red\" in his face claiming by our waitress that the girl by my bf is a better \"shaker\" (obviously with EVERYTHING jiggling) and my bf's friend couldn't help but laugh since he was sitting across from me watching my face as she shook her tits in MY bf's face totally reading my expression out loud after she left the table. Its one thing if i don't come with, but when i am with him don't try no funny business in front of me. I am not insecure people I just do not feel comfortable watching my boyfriend oogle some ugly ass(literally) broad shake her tits 2 inches from his face. Territorial and Jealousy are two different things.   ANYHOW....  FOOD: AWESOME chicken sandwich with the pesto mayo is to die for. cole slaw is okay french fries are stellar and so is the garlic fries apparently.  It is a little pricey but it was a first and last thing for me. I wasn't so thrilled with the place i want to go back for the food and tits in my face thing again as a customer.   Our waitress always came by and even sat at our table sometimes. which i thought was weird but shes 19 so you know...19 your dumb at that age in a way. You may be book smart but nobody invited her to sit at our table like she was our long lost best friend. Excuse me but go back to work we are having a discussion and have to stop our discussion now to make a new one because you have nothing better to do at work obviously (even though you are in a tiny outfit and could be building on your tips at other tables but making me want to give you less).  So thinking about all this that has happened i am only giving them half a star for the food and half a star for the fact the waitress always asked if we needed anything else. But to cut into our discussions i found to be extremely unprofessional and rude in a way. So after that i really can't say that i would want to return to any Tilted Kilt to be quite honest with you unless i was offered a job there. HONESTLY...",

The hostess had no clue which TV to sit us by, nor did she seem engaged at all in providing any sort of customer service. We finally just chose a table ourselves and asked her to change a channel. This was on a Thursday night, so it was not the busiest of nights. A tall waitress with glasses walked by us about 6 times and said nothing. She looked bored and tired and she must have yawned at least 4 times that I saw. The very pretty manager also walked by us a couple of times and said our server would be right with us. Finally a server came to us after we had been sitting for about 10 minutes, but she wasn't even our actual server. She did take our order, but told us that Janelle would be our official waitress. Janelle was as awesome as she could be and we really appreciated her at least trying to let us have an enjoyable experience, but too little too late. That was truly the only bright spot of the night. We will likely never be back to this establishment. TV's were fine, beer selection was fine, eye candy was pretty lacking and the poor attitude did not help.",

Been here probably 40+ times with big and small groups and almost always had a great experience.   The inside is clean, the patio has a great view, there's tons of TVs with every conceivable game on at every angle you could look at, and they sometimes even throw my Browns up on the big screens, which is nice. I usually order the TK Signature Sauce wings for a great sweet/spicy mix, and they've always got a decent beer selection with great seasonals to wash it down with.  Kelly, our server last time, was prompt, hilarious, and kept us supplied with wings and alcohol to our heart's content, and even talked Star Wars with us during half-time. It's great to have servers that add the personal touch like that.  Look, it's not the Ritz Carlton. It's a sports bar with a bunch of ladies trying to get through college running around and serving food and beer in not much clothing. I think the place is perfect for what it is: a great unsophisticated way to kill a Sunday.  Four stars though because I suppose it's just a tad expensive for bar food. Anyone whining about parking apparently doesn't know that A) there's a giant garage underneath their feet and B) they're happy to validate it.",

Still on a high from enjoying a concert across the street at US Airways, we were ready to do some drinking. Found our way upstairs to the Tilted Kilt and sat at the long bar table. The waitresses are really nice and it seemed to be a tag team effort going on to keep the customers happy and their drinks full.  We were more interested in drinking than eating but appetizers were ordered (gotta soak up some of the alcohol!!). Three of us had pretzels and they came out hot, fresh and delicious. But the beer cheese. Ugh, the beer cheese. None of us cared for it. When a waiter was removing our dishes, he noticed one plate was practically untouched. He asked if it was unsatisfactory and the reply from K was that she didn't like the cheese. The waiter quietly told us he didn't either and then asked if he could bring out some nacho cheese. Much better choice for K but of the two kinds of cheese, 3 of us thought the beer cheese was better...and we didn't even really like that. A spinach artichoke dip and chips was ordered by M and it was quite good. In fact, we all helped her finish it off.  Service is great at TK and the prices fair. In fact, I was surprised at the price of our shots - very reasonable, especially the Don Julio Blanco (my fav).   Good times!",

Being a Clemson fan, there was a sea of orange in the restaurant, more than crimson.  We were there to meet up with friends and watched some of the NFC playoff games that were going on.  We sat at the bar during our first visit, and had some bar stools and tables set aside later in the evening.  All the beer we had was cold.  The food was okay.  I checked in on Yelp! and received a FREE order of the Irish Nachos.  They were good.  Different, but good.  Our waitresses kept the drinks coming so we were happy.  This was a GREAT location because it was just up (literally) from the area where the Fan Experience was taking place outside.",

    "text": "I hate chain restaurants. I loathe \"pubs\" that aren't really pubs, and I'm not a big fan of breastaurants.  But the downtown Tilted Kilt holds a special place in my heart.  See, I'm an fan of U.S. soccer. And once upon a time, nobody cared about U.S. soccer. But Tilted Kilt opened its doors to U.S. soccer fans, put matches on the big screen, and said, \"Hey boys, you pound those drums and raise those scarves and get drunk within our four walls.\"  Because this Tilted Kilt location really does treat you like a friend. Everyone is friendly. And there are real personalities behind that corporate logo.  Some key perks:   FREE PARKING. Park in the CityScape parking structure, and TK will validate your parking pass for up to two hours.  SPEEDY TACOS. When you think \"pub,\" you might not thing \"fish tacos,\" but they seriously are the best thing on the menu. And they come out SUPER fast, sometimes faster than your beer.  KILT LIFTER: Of course TK would serve this local brew. But man, it's good. And it gets you drunk like pow.  TOBY & RJ: The Tilted Kilt managers are absolute gems. They come out and shake your hand. They genuinely want to know if you're having a good experience, and they make sure you do. Classy.  Caveat:   SLIDER CITY isn't actually a city of sliders. In fact, it's just one slider, even though there are several in the photo of Slider City. Just know that when you think, \"My, that is an awfully reasonable price for a city of sliders.\"",

As for this time we showed up on feb 27 it was different . Within an hour or two it really got busy and we thought that the staff was going to be short handed. Boy we were wrong , the employees just kept coming. We never had to wait for anything. We had a great time the food was amazing. I have been building restaurants for 20 yrs and the management was amazing. Two shout outs to Toby and mj ! And are great bartender Jackie! We flew from LA just for the hell of it and we will be back. Thank you from Ron and Tish",

We watched as others seated around us received service but not us. We spoke to the manager and guess what? WE STILL DIDN'T GET SERVICE!!!!! Okay I understand things happen. But,4 times in one year? Customer service sucks and the food is marginal at best. I WILL NEVER visit this Tilted Kilt in my lifetime and I will not recommend this place for anyone who is downtown looking for a sports bar.",

I mean, if there were four Charlie's Angels. And if they wore the itsy bitsy outfits the gals do at Tilted Kilt. (I may need to tack the photo to my gym log book as a motivator. Damn them!)  The kids that work there have boundless energy and seriously know their beer. Our server was very well versed in the food menu as well. She was quick to take an order and turn it around.  Additionally our server knew the Phoenix downtown area really well. I live in Arcadia and am just getting to know downtown. I was around the corner for an event and had come over for a drink. With her boundless energy it was (beyond) easy to stay drink and be merry!  (I'm going to have to come back and fill in our super awesome server's name. I don't have it handy right now. If you do look at my photo - it would be the brunette closest to me. The photo I'm referring to is in my profile photos. Not in the business photos.)  The only ding - and this isn't actually a ding - I would give to my server is her boundless energy. Good lord! I think she must have Monster Energy Drink pulsing thru her veins. That one can talk forever and not be tired. Truth!   The thing is - she's super cute! Not annoying. Very entertaining. I definitely have to find out her name so you can meet her too!  If you like to drink (and who doesn't?) beer this is a good place! Ok, and the outfits probably don't hurt business either ;)",

    "text": "As much as I'd like to give this place a good review, I just can't. TK is always reliable for one thing: atrocious service. It is pretty much guaranteed, five times out of ten, that you will be ignored for about 5 minutes until the servers get it together. And, in a completely unapologetic manner, they will eventually take down your order.   In one specific instance, of horrible service, we went to TK to watch the 2014/2015 NBA Finals. On that occasion, the fire alarm went off and everyone was asked to leave the restaurant (but only after we were asked for our ID's so that we didn't skip out on the meal). Upon returning, we sat back down at our seats to our cold food. The server apprehensively asked if we would like our food reheated. We said no, it would probably be fine, but we would like a discount on our meal. We received no such discount and no manager ever made an effort to approach our table. However, anyone would feel mean if they pressed the matter to an inexperienced server that had probably just turned 18 or 19.   I cannot, in good conscience, give this restaurant a good review. But hey, they'll stay in business because after all, it's not the service or the food they're concerned about. It's about the sex appeal. Any sap that get's flirted with, by a cute girl, isn't going to complain about the service.   DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GO TO MAJERLE'S!!!!!! Better food, cute ladies, and they don't treat you like shit.",

I used to work in a bar so I'm not unsympathetic to the trade and am usually forgiving of poor service, but it was like this a few more times before I decided it was not worth it to return despite the amount of sports I get to watch at once.  Perhaps this is just a place for lecherous men to stare at skimpily dressed adolescent girls, rather than a sports bar. And perhaps that was the problem, the times I was there it was to watch a game and not fawn over the server, and for that my table and I received poor and indifferent service.   Trade the big screen for better service and watch your sporting events at a real bar. This place sucks unless you like processed food, and crappy beer served to you with incompetent contempt.",

We were told there was a server switch and would be expected to get service soon. We had to grab a manager to get it all sorted out. Once we started getting served again, by Celeste, who was amazing, it wasn't a problem. But then as we were getting our checks, there was a problem. We were told the \"Hoppy Hour\" would give us better drink specials than our checks showed. We grabbed a manager and was given the \"we can do anything we can to solve this problem\". The problem was $4 taken off our $40 tabs. The service we received here was unexpected and unwelcome. Maybe next time it will be better",

Upon arrival we were told the wait time was approximately 20 to 30 minutes and being a busy Saturday night, we totally understood and decided to order a couple drinks and enjoy the view from the outside balcony while we waited. After 45 minutes had passed, I asked the hostess for an update and was told it would be another 10 minutes or so. After another 15 minutes I got a text on my phone saying \" Your table is ready, please see your host to be seated!\"  It all went downhill from there. We stood at the hostess station for nearly 10 minutes before she got around to taking us to our table, and when we got to our table....NO CHAIRS! I asked jokingly \" Do we get chairs ?\" She turned and left the room to, I assume, look for some. Another couple 2 tables over offered us the 2 chairs they weren't using.  A slogan constantly shown on one of the many TVs says \"nothing looks better than a cold beer\" which inspired my wife to order a Guinness which in turn was delivered in a nice warm plastic cup while my water was in a nice cold glass. We ordered some nachos for an appetizer and when our server returned a few minutes later, she asked if we wanted to order anything else. I got a bbq bacon cheese burger with a side of rings and my wife got a philly of some sort. Another 10 minutes go by and she brings the burger and sandwich. \"No nachos?\", I asked. \"They didn't bring them?\", she asked. She turned to walk away and I said to just take them off the bill and we'd just eat what we have. My wife's sandwich looked very good and she had no complaints. The burger, while looking good, had a bun that was either stale or  over toasted and nearly void of bbq sauce and the onion rings were undercooked and on the soggy side.   Now I always say that if you don't bring the problem up to the staff when something is not right, you can't complain bout it later. But our server never came back around till she brought the check and I was starving, so nearly half my food was gone. And when I looked at the bill....the nachos were still on it!  My overall opinion is that this place is a Hooters with Irish decor that thinks having its help show a ton of cleavage and belly buttons would make up for shoddy service and mediocre (at best) food. It did not. I've had better burgers and service at a Denny's.   One star because my wife ate her entire sandwich.",

    "text": "I ordered the Irish Nachos. BIG MISTAKE. At other restaurants, irish nachos are sliced potatoes that are then fried (like french fries but sliced into rounds instead of strips). At the Tilted Kilt, it's Lay's potato chips with cheese and ground beef on top. Are you kidding me? The ground beef was poor quality, and on top of that, it wasn't even seasoned. My husband got the boneless wings and I asked him how they were and he was like, \"eh.\" Our other friends were also disgusted with the food - they ordered what I did. My husband was sorely disappointed with the beer selection. Also, our server was terrible. She took one order and left the table - didn't bother to ask if anyone else wanted anything to eat or drink. What? I had to call her back to the table to get the rest of our orders. Spent a ton of money and the food, beer, and service were garbage. We're never going back. You're probably better going to that other tacky sports bar. At least they have better beer selection!",

The waitresses are good to look at and the beer is cold, although a bit pricey. We didn't try the food, but I didn't have much to complain about.",

My beer was good but that is thanks to Sam Adams.    I will not go back to this tilted kilt. I would rather eat overpriced ball park food.    I wish I could have reviewed the food, but my time is more valuable than the tilted kilt realizes.",

After a few more minutes and me literally doing some SOS arm-waving action, she came over to us.  By that point we were done, and she didn't seem to care at all. Didn't apologize. Just blank stare and moved on to the next person in line.  I'm all fine with bars with skimpy dressed chicks, but no burger or beer is worth that crappy of service.",
