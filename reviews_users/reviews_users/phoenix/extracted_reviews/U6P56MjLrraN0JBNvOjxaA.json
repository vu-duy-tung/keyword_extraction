    "text": "Whats worse: an ex-con burger flipper who actually barks at you for your order, a filthy condiment bar, cash only, a cashier that walks up and asks you for your drink order and then walks across the restaurant as he goes and clears a table after he just asked you a question, or the fact that if you don't have cash you get to pay an extra $4 on top of your $5-7 burger to use their cute little ATM machine.  I KNOW: the fact that for some reason people completely overlook it all: \"If you go to ASU, you have to go to Chuck Box! So good dood.\"  I was in line, realized I had no cash and began to turn around to go to the ATM up the street. Spatula Master must have noticed that I was about to eff-up his patty streak before his next Skoal break, and shot me that \"I'll put 50 wounds into your torso with this Bic pen\" look, to which I respond: \"I'll be right back\"  And the response I get: \"OOOK? Whatever!\"  Really? :-O  I would have left, but I was there with friends - damn.  They even have a sign posted claiming that they take cash only because they need to speed up the line. I got an idea: how about you employ more than TWO PEOPLE to service your entire restaurant. No? OK, waste my time and my money instead. I get you. Oh but, that can't be so, not if your website states:  \"Besides a cold beer and a burger, I'll be here to greet you with a smile and a hug. - Big Juan\"  Big Juan must've gotten mugged by the two thugs working the grill at burger number 278. Poor Big Juan, I'd probably like this place if he was still around: I was able to make a pretty tasty burger out of a 1/3 lb. on wheat with pepper jack, jalapenos, and onion.  And no, this isn't what it means to be a Hole in the Wall; go up the street to Pollo Supremo: literally nothing but nice Mexican ladies serving you unique and very tasty food for a really good price. Yes they don't take cash, but they don't make excuses, and never would I expect to be greeted with that paint-peeling ex-con death-stare. And whats with the gimmicky Western decor? Hole in the Wall? The closest reason Chuck Box could be categorized Hole in the Wall: I'm afraid to eat here because if I piss off Spatula Master-Burger Nazi, he'll probably grab that red hot grill and flip it over on top of me... you gotta be mildly afraid to eat at a Hole in the Wall...  In all seriousness though, there's no excuse to treat paying customers like they're wasting your time. Maybe people don't know how to react, or they think that somehow its cool to go to Chuck Box and get treated like a roach.  OOOK? Whatever!",

My little sister loves this place because she is young and still prefers cheese burgers with boring toppings... like plain cheese and ketchup. The chuck box makes a good boring burger. They fall short of their topping options. The lettuce, tomato, onion, sauce, ect. are subpar. I believe a good burger needs a good selection of fresh toppings.   The don't appreciate the value of fresh burger fixings. They would greatly benefit from putting more effort in keeping the fixings fresh.",

Try the jalapeno poppers - they are also awesome.  There were four of us and including the beer, the entire meal was less than 30 bucks - you can't beat that!  Service was also outstanding!

    "text": "Ever wonder why a place that doesn't have seafood has a warning that the food served may contain shellfish products? I do! Just a question to ponder while you what in a long line for a juicy burger at this no-frills eatery.  We showed up on a beautiful Friday, so of course there was a mad rush. Unfortunately, there was no free parking available, so I paid for parking across the street at the ASU lot.  After walking up to order a bacon burger and fries, we got lunch served on a paper plate, like you would at a family BBQ or picnic grill. Seriously, it's no frills. Then, you head over to the condiment bar to get your own lettuce, tomatoes, ketchup, onion, etc. Just like if you were at a family BBQ. Noticing a trend?  Now, find a place to sit, but warning, it might be sticky!  On to the food: the burger was juicy, and had good flavor, but the bun was TERRIBLE. Grocery-store-white-bread-soggy-in-10-seconds, wait, the kind that you get at a family BBQ, bun.  Toppings were acceptable, not exceptional.  Fries were decent.  You gotta eat pretty fast before the sandwich falls apart.  Pros: juicy burger. Cons: bad bun.   Come here if you miss your family BBQ! And what is up with that food allergy warning?",

Our two burgers were the only ones on the grill for a good five minutes before an avalanche of chicken and beef entered the foray. I ordered my 1/3 pounder from Juan well done and it was fresh beef and seasoned with salt/pepper it seemed. Good sesame buns and a solid order of onion rings (its from a bag, but a gourmet bag at least). Condiment bar was well stocked and it was  a great burger with a unique ordering experience and atmosphere. Unless your at Behihana, you never get to interact with the cook, so now if he didn't make it well done. I can give up it right back, but it was. so no problem. Probably the best in the $6 burger category.",

Yes, it is odd that one shouts ones order over a line of waiting patrons to the loud chef in the kitchen - but that just add to the experience.   Weird - a bit Unorthodox - absolutely Wrong - not at all  Then after joining the crowd of hungry, waiting customers I start to checking out the place. Red hot fire that the burgers all are braised over makes it kinda genuine in a way. A bar in the centre with all condiments and fixings, is up for grabs once the correct burger has been fetched and paid for.   As I stated initially, I got myself a very tasty burger and a small serving of very tasty onion rings. It was Friday, so I'm allowed to.  I even liked the crates that substitutes for chairs and makes sure that as long as you are here, you are here to eat. There was a few things that could been improved, (and the ill manner isn't one of them) but overall I really enjoyed the chuck box and I will come back. Oh yes, I will come back.",

This place has the most quintessential burger that I've ever tasted, and I've had a lots of them.  And I have to say I hardly give high praise to restaurants because I am very critical and picky.  Without being organic, grass fed, or whatever, this place is amazing.  The burgers are cooked right in front of you and they season it just perfectly.  The size of the patty is perfect where it's not too thick to be considered a steak much like that of gourmet burgers nor is it too thin like the lame 5 Guys chain.  The condiment bar has nice and fresh ingredients.  I also have a theory that it tasted so good because the place is so locked in.  I don't remember much windows in the building and there was a lot of smoke inside because the grill was inside.  Maybe that's what made it extra smoky tasting.  I remember the burgers being so good I walked 2.5 miles from my hotel to eat it for lunch after having had it for dinner the night before.",

We must have gotten there just at the right time because there wasn't much of a line. I did however see the \"cash only\" sign right away which might be annoying to some. This is my kinda place though-a hole in the wall with delicious simple food! I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and I loooove how they made the circular bacon to fill the whole burger! I can see how the condiment station might be a turnoff for some but considering I like my burger pretty plain it didn't really bother me. We rode the light rail so we didn't have issues with parking but I can see how the parking might be problematic around lunch time. I dig the tree stumps as chairs but that's just me. We got 2 burgers/fries and 2 drinks for 20 bucks and it was worth every penny. Every few months I think about becoming a vegetarian, it's places like this that make me realize what a ludicrous idea that would be!",

The place is dark, dirty and dingy...my burger was small, overcooked (and I like things well done!) and not all that impressive - taste wise.  The fries/onion rings were about average and the cost was not as cheap as many people would like you to believe.  Now, keep this in mind - I had yet to try In-N-Out Burger when I decided I did not like The Chuck Box...once I had In-N-Out, it was all over for The Chuck Box.  I have no idea why anyone would go here with In-N-Out only a short distance away.  In-N-Out tastes better, it's cheaper and definitely cleaner...I wonder what frequent visitors to the Chuck Box think about it being dark as hell...maybe to cover up the grime?",

Our kids love it and have even requested it as their birthday dinner. I always get the Big One with cheddar.  The jalapeno poppers and fried zucchini are a must have.  The condiment bar has everything you need and has great ranch for dipping.  The cost is fair, for 2 people burgers and drinks with poppers and zucchini to share will run you about $21 dollars.  They only take cash so make sure you're prepared or you'll have to use the ATM inside which charges a fee.  The place looks very dirty and run down and you have to sit on crates.  The employees aren't the friendliest and the cashier/fry guy in the do-rag is scary (think Soup Nazi for you Seinfeld fans) so you better make sure you order correctly and quickly including which type of bun, stand in the correct spot while waiting for your food (basically right in front of the soda machine), move when you're supposed to (as soon as they call out your burger), have your cash ready and don't talk to him (unless you're going to talk about Star Trek).    If you want clean and friendly don't come here, but if you're looking for the best burger around make sure to give it a try. The place can get pretty busy especially during the school year, so if you don't want to stand in a very large line try to get there for a late lunch or early dinner.",

There are various other items you can have added to the burger upon ordering. They have bacon that is shaped into a ring the size of the patty to ensure complete bacon coverage. Other options include pineapple and green chilies.   Other toppings (pickles, onions, lettuce, etc) and condiments are available at a self serve buffet table after you receive your burger and pay.   Fries and onion rings are just average.",

    "text": "Gotta love back-to-basics places like The Chuckbox! Simple menu, affordable and cash only, and quite the bang for your buck in terms of deliciousness from such an unassuming spot.  I got \"the great big one\" and a side of fries and it was all awesome! Don't be too intimidated when they throw that frisbee-sized burger patty down on the grill (it shrinks up to just a bit larger than the bun). The thinness allows them to handle the large volume of customers and leaves you with a perfectly-cooked burger. I'm not sure what their blend is, but it's a delicious patty! The fries are pretty standard, but they were cooked perfectly (not too dry, not too soft, and not too salty).  The fixin' bar is nicely stocked and clean, despite what you'd expect upon entering a place with such divey vibes, as well. The only thing that was a bit intimidating as first-timers was the ordering process. If it's your first time, maybe check the menu online before you go. If the lines are long, don't be surprised if they ask you what you want well before you get close enough to the menu to make your decision. The staff is nice, but you certainly feel a bit rushed by their system! Luckily, I'm guessing they do a pretty good job with whatever they turn out, so you could likely order anything on-the-fly, and you won't be disappointed.  As a fan of places like this, I appreciate their pace, quality, and service, and would certainly visit again if I ever return to Tempe! Oh, and the cheap prices don't hurt, either!",

The four of us including the service dog Nina, had great food and a great time. We will def b back. Thank you for being a great establishment",

You walk up and order and then you are supposed to stand there and wait for them to cook your burger, while people try to pass in front and back of you to get their food that is done before yours.  This is also the same place where the refills are so you have to maneuver around the condiment table and through the line to get a drink refill.   The condiment stand is a haven for germs. Last time I was in I saw a dude sneeze and then use his fingers to grab pickles. Geeerooos. I went pickle-less that visit.   The seats sucks and the tables are dirty and you wind up smelling like a campfire from all the smoke. No thanks.   And they only take cash!",

Slide on over to the left and grab a drink. Then just be patient and they'll have your burger ready in a minute. Slide over to the left again and you can grab a fry. Then time to pay--cash only, mind you. Now the beauty of the process is the condiments bar. You can make as simple or complex of a burger as you want. Nothin fancy, just a burger done exceptionally well.  I miss the second location they had in Scottsdale on Scottsdale and Shea. An Oreganos replaced it years ago and I still hold an irrational grudge against that establishment.",

When I was living in AZ I would come here occasionally & I've been here a couple times over the past few years when I've been in town for a visit.  The burgers (and BBQ chicken sandwiches) at The Chuck Box are DELICIOUS!  If you like burgers & can care less ambiance/atmosphere then come here.  If ambiance/atmosphere mean a great deal to you then you might as well stop reading this review & ignore the five stars.  Like I said the burgers & BBQ sandwiches are fantastic (and according to my mom and sister the hot dogs are as well...they're served cut in half on hamburger buns).  Everything is grilled to order so it all tastes fresh.  A couple things at The Chuck Box that I think get overlooked because of the burgers are the sides....particularly the fried mushrooms & zucchini.  I don't know what it, but the mushrooms in particular are to die for!  In addition there's a large condiment bar w/plenty of fixings w/anything you can think to put on a burger including ranch dressing, which is perfect for the mushrooms & zucchini.    The place itself isn't much to look at, but who cares?  There's only one person taking orders as you walk in, and there's often times a line almost out the door.  They also just call orders out as they're ready, not necessarily in the order as they were placed, so things can gets a little helter-skelter, but in the end it's all good, and the Chuck Box is as good as it gets!",

In fact, I am giving a five star rating here purely on the hamburger, which is absolutely delicious.   Another positive is the condiment bar for the burgers. It is well stocked, so you can add what you want. The fries are good, and I like that they don't offer a huge portion at an inflated price like some burger joints in town.  As another reviewer alluded to, this restaurant definitely has character. It can get very crowded and parking can get sparse, so try to go during off hours or when ASU is not in session. it is also cash only, though they do have an ATM there.",

It is kind of \"cafeteria style\" where you place your order and then move down a line while you wait for them to cook up your burger. You move down a line and pick up your fries or other side items, then you get your burger and pay at the cashier. There is a condiments bar that features all the standard burger toppings. It can be a little chaotic trying to grab everything you want, and essentially make your burger. I felt really rushed since there was a ton of people there, and so it was kind of crazy getting everything. I would rather have the toppings already come on the burger instead of having to go through the hassle of doing it myself. The seating inside is somewhat limited, and very cramped. I liked this place overall though, and would definitely come back here. I thought that the burger was really excellent. The fries and fried zucchini were really good as well.",

I have memories of the Chuck Box from when I was a little kid and used to go to work with my dad during the summer... he worked at the ASU Student Book Center on College Ave and we would come here often for lunch.  Back then everything seemed much bigger from the size of the place to the size of the burgers.   While Michael and I were perusing the menu we noticed (out loud) that the menu and the condiment bar were almost exactly the same as Hamburger Works in Phoenix.  The guy behind the counter mentioned that the manager of the Chuck Box was part owner of Hamburger Works... it all makes sense now:)... and i guess we didn't have to drive that far after all.   The burgers were tasty and so were the fries... it really hit the spot!",

I try so hard to recreate the awesomeness that is the combination of the lean 80/20 beef (bought from a local Scottsdale butcher, and hand pounded using old Mexican preparations), crisp greens (or grilled green chillies/pineapple), and lightly toasted bun; but my efforts are futile. It cannot be done. I have to admit, I worked at this run-down looking little shack, but it wasn't until I recognized the \"flavor\" that I knew I had to be part of a legend. Don't expect a cute little smile when you walk in the door, and don't wear your sunday best. Rest assured that anything you order will be the best you'd ever have. A guide to ordering at The Chuck Box: White or wheat? Chicken (Plain, Hot n' Spicy, BBQ, or Teriyaki) or Beef (Little Once (1/5lb), Big One (13/lb), or Great Big One (1/2lb))? Cheese (American, Swiss, Pepperjack, or Cheddar)? Bacon? Green Chile? Pineapple? Guac? (believe it or not you then dress it up yourself at the best condiment bar). And on the SIDE: Fries, Onion Rings, Mushrooms, Zucchini, Jalapeno Poppers, Chicken Strips, Chili? ......Man I want some right now....",

I've been frequenting this establishment since 2005 when I was first brought here by a colleague while I was in town on business. We stopped in for a quick lunch. This burger joint is one hidden gem placed in plain sight. The burgers, chicken, and hot dogs are all cooked fresh, on an old school classic coal grill. Juan, the owner and a great man. Salt of the earth type. Is there everyday, humbly putting his nose to the grindstone and putting in that work to insure all his patrons receive the best product possible. The burgers are my favorite! You can't go wrong with those. And their root beer on draft is absolutely top shelf and delicious.",

All together i would go back even with the prices being a bit steep. Also CASH ONLY",

The location is right next to the ASU campus. It has an old western look on the outside. On the inside is a casual look with a condiment bar right in the middle. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger. The burgers were instantly put on a grill that broils the meat giving you that family BBQ type of look and taste. I was excited to eat my burger the minute I saw it cooking on the grill. Once the burger is cooked you can put whatever condiments you want on it. The burger was good it tasted like a typical burger cooked on a grill. I just felt like I needed to have another because he portions weren't to big. Overall I did enjoy trying this place out definitely recommend eating here if your in Tempe.",

You can really taste the wood coal in the burgers.  Anywhere I can add as many pickles to a burger as possible is a great place in my book.

The menu is simple and the most important tip is that they are CASH ONLY!! Take head people , and bring your cash. You get to stand and watch as they grill your burger and fry your sides right in front of you. The place is tiny , for big events they set up and extra grill their parking lot with tables and chairs to help accommodate their dedicated fans . I swear to you they are the Best burgers in Tempe !

There's parking available but DONT wonder off the premises and keep your car in their lot it will get towed.   Friendly service and while the line may seem long at first it moved really fast. The inside interior is cute and simple, a little rustic even. I like the outdoor seating area where you are sitting in giant piece of rounded wood - I forget the name heheh .. Anyways come here and get a double patty, if you're not super hungry and don't have a giant appetite get a double \"little one\" otherwise get the BIG ONE..

I decided to try their small cheeseburger and fries. You can tell that them putting the patties on the charcoal grill makes a huge difference as far as taste, and it was very good. Their fries too are some of the better ones that I've had as well.  While the food was certainly very good and I would come back here again, there are some gripes that I have with this place. Parking around here can be difficult which could potentially deter me from coming here more often. Also, the ordering assembly line style can be awkward somewhat at times but it's not a big deal to me. As long as the food is good I don't really care about those things but I just wanted to make others aware of them.  I do anticipate coming back here again as the food was excellent.",

As an ASU alumni, I went here all the time when I was on campus with friends. Occasionally on the weekends we'd have beer and burgers here, can't be beat. The line an get pretty long but that's because the food is good. If you order chicken, expect it to take a while longer than the burgers, and get out of line but keep an eye on it. I read a review from someone calling the place dirty, which is funny because they must not get out much. The place is not dirty, it is old and authentic, and clean as it is going to get. If you're in Tempe and hungry and have cash and want a burger, come here. It's not fast but it's delicious.",

I want to complain about the long, disorganized lines in which you place orders 8 spots from the grill by yelling what you want...but it seems to work. No one's order gets messed up.   The burgers are legit...nice quality, lean beef that you get to watch sizzle on the flame. Don't order yours well-done, or the staff will roll their eyes, and people like me will give you dirty looks for holding up the line. I got the Tijuana torpedo, which is just pepper jack and green chile. Even though the bun is a simple, wimpy sesame, it still holds up to be a nice meal. Fries aren't shabby, either. I'd like the burger to get seasoned just a tad bit, but then again there's a couple dozen condiments for you to choose from.  The menu is simple, affordable, and filling. You can grab a table and a beer and catch some sports. It's just an old-fashioned establishment that deserves to survive the gentrification of pretentious local-this and organic-that eateries.",

Despite being a prodigal patron, with as far as a decade span since our last meal here, the burgers are still good as ever, with reasonable prices for what you get.  I browsed through the menu and decided on the Tijuana Torpedo ($6). It was a monstrous meal, with 1/2 of ground beef, 2 whole grilled green chiles, and jack cheese. The burgers are grilled right in front of you, and sides include fries, onion rings, and fried zucchini.  The burger bar has a plethora of toppings to choose from after you get your burger. Such options include lettuce, tomato, jalapeno, onion, mustard, ketchup, and relish.   The burger was quite tasty, with a pleasant grilled flavor from both beef and the green chile. The green chiles I had were pretty mild, so if you want to kick up the heat, add some jalapenos from the burger bar.  Be sure to remember that it's cash only here. This keeps prices down, but at the same time it can be inconvenient if you typically don't carry much cash in your wallet. They do have an ATM machine though if you've forgotten!",

I will quickly refer anyone here for one of their delicious hamburgers. A couple options in patty size, cheese experience and additional toppings on the grill. A couple fried vegetable options to choose from, zucchini & fries hit the spot for me. A full condiment bar to top off your burger to its perfection. Not much more you can ask for.....  FYI-They only take CASH so bring sum chedda. They do have an ATM tho in case you forget. Also, good food can sometimes equal a bit of a long line to get up to the grill and with being smack dab in the middle of ASU this place can get packed. Have a prospect grab you some seats is my recommendation while you drool in line for a delicious bite to eat",

    "text": "It's a pretty good burger with loads of smoky charcoal flavor. Grilled in front of you over actual charcoal, this burger place makes them just like your family did for cook outs on the fourth of July. They even have you put on your own condiments like you did back home.  Which all in all is great, but also pretty limiting. They do make burgers a bit better than your dad ever did, but not by a whole lot. It really is like eating food from a family barbeque--tasty and full of nostalgia, but not much more. It IS cheap, to be fair, but doesn't live up to the hype.",

Fire and smoke from lump charcoal sizzles and flavors handmade beef patties on top of cast iron grill grates . Add cheese and a fresh bun - I think our Neanderthal ancestors would be proud (and a tad bit jelly).   The burgers range in size from 1/4 lb to a full pound if you're really hungry. The combinations of toppings are endless with a full bar of condiments at your disposal. I am damn full, but I think I just talked myself into a burger to go.  And while this is certainly a eat with your hands kind of place, what makes it the best in The Valley is that this joint is 100 % #ForksUp . Can't beat that.",

I had high expectations because it reminded me of a grill place in Albuquerque. I can't decide if that is it, or I just didn't like the burger. Green Chile was like lettuce, iceberg lettuce. The onions that I piled on, were also flavorless. However, I did think they had the smoothest, great tasting root beer! Wow. Now that is special. I wish it was sugar free so I could drink more of it, but no. I just had a few sips from Brad's glass. It is dark inside, which I liked. The decor is simple and ingenious. Very comfortable seating.

Everything is cooked to order over a mesquite grill by Juan, and although it takes a bit of time, it's well worth the wait. I get the spicy version and load it with jalapenos, mustard, pickles and lettuce.  Hint - go during an off time or when ASU is on break.

Be ready to order when you get up to the grill cause I guarantee you there will be plenty of hungry patrons waiting in line with you.  Get your hot burger from the grill master and work your way to the condiments bar which has all your favorites.  Love that we get to pick and choose how much or how little we want on your burger.  I also love their fries, onion rings, and fried zucchini.  Prices are so reasonable and the food is worth the drive every time.  It is located near ASU so it will be packed most times and parking can be sparse.  We have been lucky to find parking and a table every time though. You gotta check it out.",

    "text": "I set up a Yelp account with the intent to only to write positive reviews, but this is going to be an exception for me. Though I haven't been to The Chuck Box for several years, I recently brought a friend who is new to town here after raving about the experience. The atmosphere is fun, the food is tasty...but I was shocked by the RUDENESS we were received with by the staff! We had barely walked in the door when the man behind the counter was already (rather impatiently) barking at us to order...yes, barking is the best way to describe it.  As we tried to advise him that we had JUST walked in and were trying to look at the menu, he continued to interrupt us and demand that we place our order.  I understand if we had been standing there taking our sweet time, but it was rather off-putting to be pressured into ordering like that, and sort of embarrassing to be addressed with that attitude in front of the other customers. Of course by the time I got my food I realized I didn't even get to order what I had wanted. There was no one in line behind us, so I did not understand why he couldn't afford us a few seconds to read the small menu. I was going to let it slip, but when the man behind the register also gave us attitude (I still don't understand why?), I had to write a review. I'd understand some curtness on their end if we were a group of loud, obnoxious students who weren't paying attention, but we were a small group of professionals who went out of our way to give this restaurant our business on our lunch break. We were very polite with them in spite of how they spoke to us, so it was all-in-all frankly uncalled for. I'm not sure if any of us will be returning...I recommend Ted's Dogs instead for your charcoal broiled cravings. It's three times as busy (because it's that good), yet the staff are just as friendly as ever.",

My boyfriend is a man's man, so he gets the real deal... and we continue to frequent Chuck for a very good reason. So do many others considering the consistent long line regardless of the often long wait ... made to order takes time, kids. I don't recommend the fried zucchini, however, just because it was a bit too cheap tasting and put together. Opt for a different side or create that ranch/hot sauce combo to make anything amazing. One last note, the guac is the consistency of \"baby poop\" I've been told. We did recommend that they switch the current guac out with a chunkier version. Then again, you might like your guac to have the consistency of mayo. Up to you. At the end of the day, this is a great joint for lunch if you're in the ASU area and looking for a cheap, tasty burger. (They also serve chicken).",

They make the burgers right in front of you on a pulley-system charcoal grill.. and you can notice that in the flavor of the patty.  Plus, they make their patties in varying weight sizes (1/3#, 1/2#, etc) so you can get as much or as little as you want.  The very flattened patty is placed on the grill and I think this is perfect for cooking quickly and safely.. also, moisture is still maintained in the patty since it's not overcooked (what you do when you have thicker patties).  They have pretty typical greasy sides.. fries.. fried zucchini.. onion rings.. it's all good standard grease-stop fare.  I wouldn't at all say this is the cleanest-looking nor the most modern (cash only) or well-maintained burger joint.. but I will say that if you want a no-thrills damn tasty burger, you should give this place a shot.    I went a couple of nights ago and it sure hasn't changed in the past 7 years... nor has it probably changed in the last 10 years :P  I did, though, really enjoy my 1/3# burger.. cooked to order, simple bun with onions, mayo and ketchup - delish!",

I haven't found more than a select few hamburger joints here that are any good. Most burger places are just mediocre or just gross. The meat isn't frozen and cooked in front of you. There is a burger condiment bar, and the menu is easy. You wait in line for your food after ordering and pay at the end once your burger is ready. They have tasty fries and onion rings like the classic burger places; not too greasy. I would have bought a larger drink if I had understood that you don't get refills. At least it didn't seem that way because the drinks are awkwardly stationed in the line. I am just so pleased to find a quality burger. And don't forget that it's CASH only, so come prepared.",

That's when my PTSD of my experience there started. And here's all I have to say. Even a cold burger and fries from McDonald's, Burger King, or Wendy's would have been more enjoyable than this clearly overrated establishment. Even the 30 second interaction with any of those mentioned fast food joints would've been better than the horrendous customer service from the Chuck Box.  I'm not sure how this place has 4 stars. My experience was awful from beginning to end. Burger was wayyyy over cooked (I think we stood there bewildered watching it cook for 15 to 20 minutes). Fries were cold, and the staff was not happy when I tried to take the fries back for some that were at the very least, warm (which by the way are just sitting under a heat lamp cafeteria style). Flavorless cardboard tasting burger. My friend got bacon on her burger and instead of freshly cooked bacon, they pulled out pre-cooked bacon to warm up... really?  Anyway, we didn't finish either of our tasteless burgers or out of a bag fries. Save yourself the regret of eating at this (cash only) dive. In n Out is right down the street and you will be greeted with a smile.",

Either way, this is a decent place for a quick collegy burger lunch. I enjoy their bbq burgers, the smoky, backyard grill taste, and the cheap prices. However, I don't enjoy the staff and most everything else. Oh, and the clientele can be a little annoying too...as its across the street from ASU. (HAH). I'll give them one thing though-- I do still crave their fried mushrooms from time to time. If you're into this sort of place, I recommend Original Hamburger Works in downtown Phoenix-- less of a hassle, same exact menu, burgers, and condiments bar, but with far less attitude and an old fashioned cowboy bar.",

As a grown-up, I was there almost weekly.  Few things make me happier than scarfing down a perfect burger with a cold Coke, snacking on some fries, sitting on a wooden box and swatting at the occasional fly.  I miss you Chuck Box, and I want a framed portrait of Big Juan for my living room.",

The Chuck Box knows exactly who their customers are, exactly what they offer and they execute with precision. Charcoal grilled burgers, fries or onion rings and a condiment bar with the essentials to finish off your meal how you like it. A home bbq weekend when ever you're in the mood.  It's simple, it's effective and above all, it's good.  Their cash only policy is a minor annoyance that you quickly forget after sinking your teeth into the fresh-off-the-grill meal.",

They have a simple menu that consists of different sized meats, cheeses and different appetizers (such as fried mushrooms). Their burgers are freshly cooked in front of you and their fries are absolutely delicious. They have a toppings station where they have burger toppings as well as dipping sauces and condiments. Their seating is similar to that of a cabin (very cozy though). As far as service, I've always gotten exceptionally good service (except for one time around two years ago). Very friendly staff and very professional at what they do. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a really good burger in Tempe.",

The onion rings are also excellent -- actual rings of onions, no bits and pieces.  Cons: 1) Dingy, dirty, dark. I don't mind the rough and simple setup, but it would be nice if they cleaned all the drips and spots off the condiment bar from time to time. Finding tomato slices in the mustard is not pleasant. Garbage overflowing the barrels is also a problem. 2) The french fries are sub-par. They're undercooked, barely crispy. Stick to the onion rings. 3) The lines. This place doesn't have enough room for all its customers, and it can be a zoo. Go off hours, if you can figure out when that is.",

    "text": "This place is cash only. I know that has been mentioned a few times in other reviews, but it's always a shocker for me.   The Chuck Box is a-okay. These are definitely not fancy/gourmet burgers. Think of it more as a dive-y bar burger. Oh, and don't expect to escape the heat at the Chuck Box. When you first walk in the door, you are greeted by the grill and a plume of smoke.   The Food: I ordered the veggie burger with fries (FRIES). Although this is a vegetarian patty, the burger is not vegetarian. The patty is cooked on the same grill as all the meat products and there is no separation of patties or utensils. If you are a strict vegetarian or a vegan, do not even think of coming here.   That being said, the garden/veggie patty was fairly good and at least the Chuck Box has a veggie patty. (I'm looking at you, In-N-Out!) The fries were also good. Not the best I have ever had and far from the worst fries I have ever had.  My ASU friend got the great big one (1/2 lb.) and the guac bacon burger with cheddar. Both burgers were thin, thus cooked well done, like a normal fast food joint. He said the bacon was okay and the guac was a little spicy, otherwise to average, smoky burgers.   The Condiments: In the center of the restaurant is a large station for adding your own toppings. My friend enjoyed the opportunity to put as much stuff on his burgers as he wanted. It was a mess of onions, pickles, tomatoes, mustard, and jalapenos. I added a bit of ketchup, lettuce, and tomatoes to my burger. The lettuce was just sad looking. So, so sad. Maybe bring your own lettuce?  The Drinks: No milkshakes here. Just soda and beer. The former is served in styrofoam cups next to the grill and the latter is served in mason jars.   Overall, this is a cash-only, average burger establishment. No frills, just thin, smoky burgers.",

Fast-forward to my return to the Valley in 2011...and in cruising through my old stomping grounds, observing that ALL the favorite spots (Mama's Pizzaria, Ozzie's Warehouse, 6 East Lounge and Long Wongs) are no more.  The Chuck Box, complete with rusty-appearing roof, still stands, though.  It is gratifying to see the puffs of smoke from the grill.  On walking in, the decor has not changed.  The tables still have copper tops, and when you sit inside, you are sitting on wooden crates.  The condiment bar is certainly one of the best I have seen in a burger joint.  It makes customizing the favored double burger with cheese and bacon SO easy!  The prices are good, the beer is cold, and the onion rings are certainly up to par.  The only thing that has changed (and maybe it is because I am 20+ years beyond my first visit) is that students seem to get faster service.",

This is what I don't like about the place: 1)  standing in a long ass line and having someone yell at me to yell my order back at them 2) the buffet of fixings that allows you, flies and everyone else and their filthy fingers to make their own burger 3) its dirty 4) I smell like a grease ball when I leave   I want to kick back and relax when I eat a meal, this place is too much work for too little pay off.",

Burgers are very good, and may taste unique in a way. I've tasted so many char-grilled burgers, I have lost count. However, CB's burgers are on top. Some times they over make fries and need to get rid of them. You will see one of the workers walking around offering customers fresh fries...like whaaaatttt? :)  Only downsides are this place only accepts CASH. Also, inside seating may be limited when busy.",

In the most convenient expressions: This place is the bee's knees... Simple, Fast, and fresh burgers over an open flame for the right price. A condiment bar,  perfect for personalizing your burger along with superb fries/onion rings makes this joint one of the finest burger spots in town.  CASH ONLY* so don't whip out the plastic like a rookie.  Only downside is that you feel like you're in an oven in the summer time, but in the winter it's nice and cozy so dress accordingly either way. I love you Chuck Box.  Eat well, Live well, and surround yourselves with ones who do.      -Cheers",

All of the traditional condiments, and lots to choose from including jalepenos, which makes me happy.  The tables have real copper tops, which is pretty rad.  You sit on old wooden crates, and if you sit outdoors, you sit on old wooden logs.  I love that this place has never updated the decor.  No need to.    If you think it is too hot inside, you should check you surroundings.  They are cooking with fire, and you wait for your food right in front of the grill.  You know the old saying, if you can't stand the heat...  When I was there today, other people were ordering chicken sandwiches.  Honestly, anything is going to taste great cooked over that mesquite fire.  Can't say I've ever had one.  Gotta get the burger here.",

It is as required at ASU as ENG101, so I am an old hand at this, but as a new Yelper, I found myself looking at it with fresh eyes today.  Yeah, you yell your order from the back of a long line. Yeah they clown you if you look confused. Bacon swiss medium. Fries   \"FRIES!\"   Buns are Aunt Hatties, cups are styrofoam, however they go paper on the plates...standard Costco that my mom serves all of our family party meals on.  Meat is great, one of the best burgers in town if only because it is the one of the only left that doesn't resort to frozen patties. Bacon is delightful.  Under 10 for everything including tip. Sat on a wooden box turned sideways. College chic. Okay, college dump, but it is much more wonderful under the haze of a few hundred hungover weekends.  Basically, a very solid independant no frills burger joint, kept thriving by those at ASU, and those like me, who still hold on to that fond charbroiled memory of ASU.  Cash only.",

It's a casual little place that charbroils your burger as you order, so they always taste hot and delicious. After your burger is cooked up, you head over to the condiment bar to dress it up as you like.  They also have some pretty good onion rings, if you're into that kinda thing.  You can grab a seat inside or you can also choose to sit out on the patio area.   The Chuck Box is one of the best burgers that you will find in the Phoenix metro area.  Keep in mind that they only accept cash.  Fast and friendly service along with great food gives the Chuck Box five stars.",

    "text": "I didn't really notice until my girlfriend said something, but it's totally True:  We, being from Southern California, are used to having a burger joint, a greasy hole in the wall, everywhere you go.  If you go to the bank, there might be a little burger stand inside.  When you wash your car, reach your hand through the window and hot wax and grab a beefy little snack.    In Phoenix, not so much.  There ARE burger places, but most often, they're a chain:  In N Out, Five Guys, Smash Burger, Fat Burger, Whataburger, etc.... and while they all vary from being pretty damn good to at least not embarrassing, it's just not the same as going to some little hidden gem, tucked between two buildings.  You have great, gourmet places like Fez, but, like I said, it's not the same.  To be honest, it's something that you really start to miss about \"home\" even though it hasn't been home for you in a long, long time.  I've ridden past the Chuck Box quite literally, hundreds of times.  It's right on my way home from work tucked somewhere into my peripheral vision and had been ignored by my brain for YEARS.  It wasn't until my sister recommend we pop in before a movie that I even knew it was there.  I'd seen the sign, but my brain never connected the dots.  This place does help to fill that void.  Not 100% but the burgers were really, really good and I love the set-up to actually see your burger get made.  Then you add your own garnishes with their floating island thing.  The price ain't too bad and the decor inside is warm and cozy.  In fact, I plan on hitting it up tonight.",

The burger had no flavor to it - just tasted like ordinary ground beef with seasoned salt. The fries weren't all that great, and the bun was nondescript. There was a ton of bacon, which may sound like a good thing, but several layers of thin bacon will never beat a single layer of good quality thick-cut bacon.  It really isn't the friendliest place around - the guy taking orders wasn't really rude, but didn't seem to go out of his way to be friendly.  But it did get very busy a little after I got there, so obviously a lot of people disagree with me. But I don't think I'll be back.",

The burgers, over the flame made them look delicious, and the idea that there is probably a few decades of grease going into each burger makes it that much more yummy at thought.

We went here before seeing a show at ASU Gammage, and I'm a fan. I only wish it wasn't so far away from where I live (Peoria), but it's now one of my East Valley food spots for whenever I'm in the area. The prices aren't bad, and you get a lot of food. The restaurant isn't exactly nice inside, and the employees aren't what you'd call friendly, but I didn't mind much because the food was so good. The one annoying thing is that they are cash-only; however, they do have an ATM inside, where you can get cash for a fee (ours was $2).",

Nostalgic for a 1973 ASU Alumni we've been going there since it opened and nothing's changed. Which is great for us. They have the best barbecued hamburger, actually all the food there is great.

They have a skeezy ATM machine in the corner, but I'd really rather not pay the 2-4 dollar fee for a 6-7 dollar burger.  It is good for burgers and I wouldn't recommend for anything else.

Trust me any inconvenience suffered while parking and getting in will soon be forgotten. Now about my experience....  I walked in to find a line (no shock there). Big Juan yelled over at me past the line asking for my order. Once I figured out what he wanted I yelled my order right back and he got it started. I have never seen it done like that, but it keeps the line moving; by the time you make it up to the counter your burger is done and you pay the cashier.  Burger in hand I moved to the condiment bar and dressed it then sat down to eat. You get your burger fixed up exactly how you like it. Burger Heaven to be sure. The ambiance is pretty cool too with the whole shack decor and wooden boxes for chairs. You gotta check this place out.  Next time I find myself in Tempe, I'll be heading to see Big Juan again!",

It gives it unique mouth watering taste. I added in blue cheese dressing at the condiments bar to it.  Fresh.  The Sonoran Draft Root Beer is very good.  Comes in a cold mug.  I don't normally drink soda pop but occasionally I will drink this.  Cash only. ATM inside.  I love coming here when I'm in the mood for a really good burger.",

Add a side of onion rings and you've got yourself a party! The place is cash only, but they do have an ATM. If you're like me and don't waste money on ATM fees, there is a Wells Fargo down the street.   I don't mind the building even if it's a little run down because it's not supposed to be like the other burger joints. I would love if they invested in AC or a big fan. If that bothers you, take your burger to go and eat in your car :)  Lastly - don't expect to get bubbly customer service because the service matches the feel of the place. Not bad service, just very 'to the point' if that makes any sense.   In summary - damn good burgers, get the onion rings, don't sit here if you get hot easily, bring cash & don't be offended if they don't ask how your day went. Solid 4 stars in my book!",

    "text": "This place was recommended by our uber driver last night. I don't really do fast food burgers so I was looking for a more hometown, mom and pop place.  Very simple menu. Burgers cooked over live wood fire. Buns toasted right next to the grill. Nice tooth pick system on what size patty gets what cheese, since there were no \"tickets\" being printed up.  Fries and other sides are fried to order and are ready once your burger is done. I like the condiment bar idea so you can fix your burger the way you like. Also, it doesn't slow down the order,cook,serve process if you fix your own toppings.  I got the double big one (2/3 lb) with pepper jack cheese and green chile. I topped it with just mustard and onions. Burger was delicious. Very lean, not much grease.   Good service. Nice atmosphere. Kinda nice watching your burger being cooked right in front of you. Definitely not a fast food spot. Cash only by the way. Plenty of signs inside and out stating this, so if you still pull out your card to pay, your the one that's causing the wait in line. Atm is available inside.",

The food is charcoal grilled and it's the kind of place where the classic hamburger really makes a case for itself. The patties also come in large sizes that make a one item dinner actually possible. I used to live in rural parts of northern Nevada and would get burgers at old timey cowboy places all the time with oversized patties; it's one of the things I miss the most now that I've come to bigger cities. However, this place is like stepping back into rural Nevada all over again. No regrets, will be coming back.",

My only gripes are that there are no refills on drinks and there is a condiment bar that was pretty messy which led me to believe that it isn't attended to as frequently as it should be. Also, the condiment bar uses cheap picnic plastic ware that could easily fall into the product... Not very sanitary. Being that this place appears constantly busy, I'm sure it's not easy to keep the patrons from trashing it.   Those are the only issues I had which would have otherwise netted The Chuck Box five stars.  I would still recommend this warm and homey little joint to my friends. :)   Like I had stated: The food is awesome and the staff are friendly and accommodating.

    "text": "First off, this place has a great name. One of the most famous burger places in the Valley, and definitely the most famous in Tempe. The building itself is pretty iconic. It's an all wood shack that you'd swear should be next to a swamp somewhere in Louisiana. Inside, you're immediately smacked in the face with a smokey aroma as they use a wood-fired broiler to give the burgers a mesquite flavor. It's set up cafeteria-style and kind of feels like you're expected to know how to order as it's all customizable with a  selection of toppings, cheeses, and bun types. For the veggies and sauces, there's a self-serve salad bar style set up for further customization.  The Burger - 7.5 (out of 10) The marquee aspect of this burger is definitely the wood-flame broil as so few places cook their burgers that way. It's not the most practical cooking method and makes for a really smokey environment. Is the Burger Guy convinced this is a better burger cooking method than a well seasoned griddle? Nah. But it does give the burger a distinct flavor. The flame broil gives it a nice char that you can't get with a griddle. I got The Big One, a 1/3 pounder that I added American cheese and bacon too. My burger was juicy, cooked perfectly, and had a really nice flavor. What I wasn't impressed with was, well, everything else. The bun was a very pedestrian sesame seed job. The bacon, likewise, nothing to write home about. The veggies were basic but even the iceberg lettuce was looking pretty pitiful. And my biggest gripe: Because of the broiler, they can't grill onions! And you all know how The Burger Guy feels about grilled onions. A burger just isn't complete without them. Lastly, I don't think I like building my own burgers. I always screw up the ratios! Overall, a pretty delicious meat patty that's dragged down by the other components of the burger.  Note: Score is for the burger only. Other factors such as service, price, and ambience are not considered.

When you first walk in you can find the menu is above the grill area, and then you place your order with the person taking orders next to the grill. The menu is short and simple. ..so it shouldn't take long to figure it out.   I got the standard burger with cheese, and fries. After paying, cash only, you go to the condiment bar and get the toppings you desire.  Rustic atmosphere and TV usually playing some sort of sports game in the corner.

While I was getting condiments one of the guys that worked there made a sly transphobic comment towards me then tried to cover it up and yelling across the room at his coworker.

    "text": "Went here on recommendation from a good friend. Kids were out of school for winter break, so I brought the family with me.   The sign on the west door says the line takes about 10 minutes from that point. More like 35-40.  Burger was pretty good. I had \"the big one.\" I like a food flame broiler burger. No seasoning at all though. Would have been better if the American cheese was tossed on a couple minutes before so it could get nice and melty.   Toppings bar was fresh and well stocked  Fries were good. Dipped in BBQ sauce and the house made ranch dressing.   No huge complaint. Wasn't best burger I've ever had but it was good. I don't know that I'd drive back again just to eat here, nor would I want to stay in a 40 minute line to eat here though.",

I got the Tijuana Torpedo, wifee got the cheeseburger. We got the drinks and fries, but saw they had beer battered onion rings. I'm a sucker for them, so you already know !  The food was amazing! Sounds like a lot of hype but very very good and reasonably priced. The grill chef cooked the burgers perfect! Tipped him just for that fact!  Very appreciative he prepared my meal. Did I mention they cool on a charcoal grill!!  You can tell the fryer oil was fresh too. My fries were golden colored, and not tinted like fries cooked in old oil usually look. Onion rings golden brown....SO GOOD!  The condiment bar was all fresh, and the crate style seating is awesome!!  Note:  Make sure to bring cash. If you don't have any no worries, they have an atm inside.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!",

You put on your own condiments, I don't like the wilted Iceberg or that the condiments are all in open containers with some flies buzzing around. Seating is crates for chairs inside and logs outside. The inside is VERY small and smells of burgers and fries, aka greasy. That being said, again, tasty, tasty burger! The grilled chicken also looks really good. No Trans fats used to fry with, good news. A big one and a soda runs $8.50.... in the ASU campus area, craving a burger?

    "text": "So I came to the chuck box off of a recommendation from a friend.  He stated that it was the best burger he's ever had and even was wanting to throw down a 20 dollar bet on this burger he was so confident.   Well after my first visit here I think he owes me 20 bucks.   First I want to say that I've had a lot of burgers in my day.  Some really good and some really bad.  One of the first signs to me of a burger that won't break my top 3 list is when I can't order it medium rare.    We got to the chuck box around noon and the place was packed to the gills.  We waited in line and I ordered the big one with cheddar on a white bun.  The burger looked decent off the grill but the bun was something I could buy at Costco (another sign of a top 3 ranking burger is a good home made bun)  I didn't have an issue with the lack of options at the condiment bar other than how the onions were diced to put on a burger made for an awkward experience.   First bite was decent enough and all the onions then fell off the burger due to how they were diced.  About half way through the burger, my bun was completely falling apart.  The onion rings were decent but yet again I've had better.    All in all it wasn't a bad burger but it wasn't at all the best I've had.   I'm pretty sure this place stays in business because it's on a college campus, it's cheap, and what college kid doesn't love a good cheap burger.  Since I have no college memories of this place to make it seem better than it really is I am impartial and can just rate the food.  All in all a decent experience but doubtful I will make the drive again for lunch.",

Cooks it right front of you and you wait for your burger to be finished cooking before you pay.   I first found this place when I was going to ASU, some classmates and I were wanting to go somewhere to study for our final exam and we were all hungry. One classmate referred this place. So we ended up here and I loved it.  I havent been here for years after, until one day my BF was craving for a burger and he wanted a real burger. Not no Mcdonalds or Burger King burgers. So I told him there was this burger joint that I once went to when going to school. I took him over here. He ordered a one patty burger and I had the chicken sandwich and he was in Love. He never knew about this place and always wanted find a place that makes a real burger. Now hes all about Chuck Box. The second time I brought him here he ordered the double patty. It was quite big and fulfilling for him. We usually order a side of fries and sometimes the onion rings as well.  Theres a condiment station when in the middle of the shop where you can add whatever you want on your burger which is pretty cool because its to your liking and you can put whatever on it.   One side note: they ONLY accept cash. So make sure you have cash before you come here. However they do have a atm machine, but to avoid getting charge a fee I suggest you come with cash in hand ready.",

Chuck Box is some of the best burgers and chicken sandwiches in town. You see your whole meal made right in front of you, which is great, plus they have pitcher beer (nothing special, just standard American piss beer). The chefs are very animated and will be more than happy to help you make your choice (as long as there isn't a huge line). Once you have your burgers and fries, you go to the topping station and customize your meal. This is my favorite part. Can't beat their burgers with onions, pickles, ketchup, lettuce, the works.  It's pretty irritating that these guys don't accept credit cards--I always forget this before I come and I end up needing to scramble to the ATM. BRING CASH! There is a Bank of America ATM on 7th caddy corner from this place and I think they have some no-name bank ATM inside. Also, parking is tricky so just be sure you don't get towed wherever you decide to park.",

    "text": "Jess' fiancee here, D.  I moved to Tempe from Ohio 2 months ago, and as far as burgers have gone, I've been extremely disappointed. \"In-n-Out\" is supposed to be a legendary chain on the west coast, and I was let down extremely. Smashburger wasn't any better either. So, I talked it over with Jess, and she suggested The Chuck Box.   Suffice to say, this blew every other place away. I ordered \"The Great Big One\" a little prematurely, as I saw the \"Tijuana Torpedo\" only after I ordered :/  Anyway, the burger itself was cooked to a medium perfection. Incredibly fresh, seasoned throughout...couldn't have been a better patty. The bacon was probably the nicest surprise. Cooked, but not too crispy. Also, IT'S IN THE SHAPE OF YOUR BURGER. Ingenious.  The condiment bar was a nice addition as well, but shredded lettuce/onions/etc. is a pain in the ass.  The only complaint I have is with the bun, they just don't seem up to par with containing the burger. Pretty bland. The beer was pretty reasonably priced too, it made watching LA winning the Stanley Cup just a little more bearable.  That being said, this is my second/third favorite burger place of all time; they do nearly everything right.  4.5/5 stars for The Chuck Box, I'll definitely be back a lot of times in the future.",

Long lunch crowd, not a fan of the guy taking orders yelling asking people in the long line for their order and I had to yell back before anyone actually got to the front, I had no idea what they offered and would have felt embarrassed if I hadn't been given a paper menu by a co-worker so I could order right away.   The place was warm, humid, my seat was a wooden box that was planted to the ground sideways so I wasn't able to move my feet very easily with the small space under the table. I'm not a fan of self serve topping section, reminds me of a smaller less air conditioned Fuddruckers except they don't have Buffalo or ostrich burgers for me to try.    They don't take cash...come on, why make people borrow from friends or pay an atm fee(my friend said their bank reimburses them). I'm curious if chuck box pockets the $2 charge in addition to saving the credit fees. They're clearly not hurting for business and they don't have a dollar menu so  just suck it up and pay the 15 cents for every $5 burger you sell for customer convince.   I don't normally pay $5.50 for a burger (over $8 with fries and tax) but they're burger was very good, their fries were great too.   There are many, MANY places to eat around ASU and if I feel like paying 8 bucks for lunch again I'll try more places I haven't been before I come here again.",

Still the worlds best burger! Although I can't handle a great big one as easily as I did back in the day!  I went to Smash Burger for the first time a few weeks ago and it's mighty good. My dad and I decided we had to make a trek back to Chuckbox to decide who has the best burger. We both agreed it's pretty much a tie. Different tasting burgers. VERY different environments; both outstanding! My dad's comment was that Smashburger tastes 'corporate' and Chuckbox tastes homemade.  If I had guests from out of town we'd go to Chuckbox every time!",

Oh, also being a meat-eater would help. If you're a sanitation-freak, I wouldn't come here.  Having eaten my lunch too early, I walked across the street from my office to the Chuckbox to give it a try. I stood in line and a nice man behind the grill took my order. A Big One, wheat bun. He then reaches into a bag o' buns and pulls it out with his bare hands, stabs it with burger and cheese identifying toothpicks, and tosses them on a flat grill surface to toast. Then he grabs his spatula and continues to flip.  The burgers move around the heat according to their done-ness, and the chicken goes where the burger was, the pineapple goes where the chicken was....get my point? If it wasn't cooked, maybe some would be worried about cross-contamination.  Anyway, the burger was AWESOME. I thought it was juicy and had good flavor. It looked like he sprinkled season salt on it--I could be wrong. I love a ton of condiments, so I really appreciated having a bar of them to myself. The lettuce was lacking--just a hacked up iceberg with some not so yummy parts, but everything else was what I wanted and more.  This place is all about expectations, and that's why I rambled so much about what some would love and what some would be terrified about.   I'll come back and try the chicken.",

By the time I'm done making my own burger, it's way too big to eat, so I have to dissect it into smaller portions..which is fun for me and highly entertaining for my friends. The only reason it doesn't deserve my 5th star is for ambiance and speed. If you're in a hurry, chuckbox might not always be the best option.

As I now understand (and others may have said), the choice seems to be what you want...burger, chicken sandwich, hotdog, veggie burger, etc.  What kind of cheese?  Bacon?  Green Chiles? Guac?  Fries or onion rings?  Stop past the grill, get your drink, wait for them to hand your plated, freshly prepared order (pre-cold veggies).  Walk past the drinks, grab your fries or, and pay.  Lots of fresh prepared veggies and condiments on a salad bar type of island for you to add as much as you like.  Very basic interior and very basic single spot necessary (a his and a hers) on the out porch.  You know the place from college if you were lucky enough to go some place that did the thing just right.  This is just right, and has the BIG extra of wood grilled meat.  This place is as well done as the best of the breed.  Excellent!  I don't give many fives, but for what it is, it is just right.",

    "text": "If you're looking for a mesquite flame grilled burger (or chicken) and you value the taste and quality of the meat as well as the overall grill flavor of the burger....  Then the Chuck Box is the only place to go in Phoenix.  There is a reason its packed at lunch.  There is a reason its been around for years while other places come and go.  There is a reason the locals swear by it.  There is a reason the atmosphere is minimal and the main draw is the burger.  The Chuck Box burgers are that good.  Why are they that good?  Its a mesquite open flame grill that has not had time to cool down in 20 years.  Trust me the burgers are moist and oh so full of that grill flavor.  As far as Mullac's review: Garbage, his other reviews are of bistros, not a burger expert.  As far as the condiment bar, its minimal because the burgers are 1lb and trust me when I say they only need minimal condiments to add flavor to the burger.  He prefers \"flat griddle-surface\" for a burger, that disqualified the review right there.  Oh and Lauren: Its busy during lunch because its that good.  If the burger at the Chuck Box was OK where did you have better?  Sorry I love food, and the Chuck Box got me all through college and is still a favorite.  Yes I created a Yelp account just to write this review.  Look at all the people who know what they're talking about, all the ones rating Chuck Box a 5.",

I called up Fatburger and they were closed at 8PM. OK seriously, who closes a burger joint in a college town at 8PM? That's just pure insanity but I digress. So there was no burger to be had and I had to has a cheeseburger NOW! By a stroke of luck someone mentioned the chuck wagon and I wondered how bad could it be? I trekked through ASU and then I reached meat heaven. It wasn't the Chuck Wagon, it was the Chuck Box. I ordered my cheeseburger and fries. Just picture that scene in When Harry Met Sally. It was so good I needed a cigarette when I was done.  I've been back a few times and the last time I tried the Chili. It was a generous serving, very tasty and most importantly it didn't give me the farts.",

    "text": "I have worked a block away from The Chuck Box for the last three years, but I only gave it a shot a couple of months ago, and then I kicked myself for not walking in this place years earlier.  I'm a vegetarian, and this may be the reason I would have never considered going into this place, until I discovered (via Yelp) that they have a veggie burger on their menu.  I order my veggie burger with pepper jack cheese, and two slices of grilled pineapple, and it is delicious.  By the way, hands down, The Chuck Box has the best fries in Tempe.  Now, there are a couple of reasons why I'm giving The Chuck Box four stars instead of five:  1) They only take cash, no cards, and this is a little frustrating in 2009.  There is an ATM in the place, but of course there is a fee for taking cash out, so you can add $2.50 to the cost of your lunch, which can kill the cost-effectiveness of eating at this place.  2) This place can get really busy and the ordering system is abrasive, i.e. the cook yelling at people to take their order.  Now, some people probably love this system, because it creates a unique atmosphere, but I just find it kind of nerve-racking.  A side note for vegetarians: If you have a problem with your food being cooked on grill that has had meat products cooked on it, where your veggie burger is in close proximity to meat on the grill, you will probably have a problem eating here.",

With that said, that stupid tongue twister is all I could think about inside the Chuck Box.  I certainly wasn't waxing poetic about the food.  I thought the burgers and chicken burgers here were OK, but just average.  The chicken burger with pepper jack was cooked just right, but nothing about it struck me as better than normal.  I've seen other burger joints with condiment bars, and was hoping for something distinctive, but no - just the typical average fixings.  The feel in here is very country or Midwestern with the wooden boxes as stools and burlap sack ceiling.  I dunno.  Can't really place it, but it's very laidback and unassuming here.  I like it, but The Chuck Box felt and tasted just average to me.  Cash only.",

Sadly the Scottsdale location (Taken over by Oreganos in about 2003) was much closer to where I was raised.   If you are a fan of IN&Out and 5 Guys, and want to change it up, I think this place is a great place to go.  The burgers are some of the best chuck you will find, grilled over mesquite wood which gives it a savry smoky flavor.  They cook the burgers right in front of you if you desire to wait in line, or they will just yell out what order is up while you grab a seat.  Toppings are self serve and fresh.  The burgers come in sizes of \"a great big one\" (3/4 lb), big one (1/2 lb), and a little one (1/3 lb).  Make sure to order the fries extra crispy, though onion rings and fried zucchini are local favorites.  I recommend anyone visiting Phoenix and claims to be a hamburger aficioando, to try this place.  Be mindful of the Cash Only concept.",

Still, grinning and bearing it, I load up my veggie burger with appropriate toppings and, usually with fried zucchini in hand make my way to one of the very uncomfortable seats.  Every time I go to the Chuck Box I feel as if there is going to be something wrong with the food, and this something is being concealed from me by the lack of lighting. Yet, each time I go I have a delicious veggie burger or grilled chicken sandwich. My friends have also enjoyed \"real\" burgers there as well.   Maybe it's best they keep the lights dim, but the food tastes so good there may be nothing to fear after all.",

Over the years I've stopped by now and then to see if it had gotten any better.   Nope, still the same boring burgers.  Char-broiling a burger over an open flame just doesn't do it for me. It always results in a dry, bland burger.  Mesquite or no, it doesn't really make much difference when you're quickly broiling the burger. And it doesn't help much to pile on a bunch of junk from the condiment/topping bar--it just makes the thing a big mess.  I'd much rather have a burger cooked on a flat griddle-surface like they do it at Delux and Welcome Diner. And when the kitchen applies the toppings for you, it results in a better melding of flavors with the rest of the burger.",

One of the things I like most is that they have a condiment bar so that you can choose exactly what and how much you want on your burger.  I love pickles and no matter how hard I try, I just never get what I want when someone else does it.  Everything is always fresh too.    If you don't want a burger, you can get a chicken breast or hot dog, but it seems almost sacriligous.    This is a good spot for lunch on weekdays if you work in the area.  It's not as crowded as you might expect given it's location in the middle of a university campus.  And it's amazing how quickly they seem to get food out ( you have to wait in line for your burger ).  Enjoy!",

I don't know if they make them fresh, but I really wouldn't be surprised if they were frozen. But everything else is incredible. As far as service goes, I'm taking a star away for that. Confused as to why this place is cafeteria style. Even if there are only a few other people in line, you'll be standing in line for 20 minutes, watching burgers cook. It's cool for about 2, then I just get hungry. That, and the guy running the cash register was a jerk. Girlfriend had her expired id while trying to get a beer(she's 24). She apologized because she'd simply forgot to throw it out. She pulled out her passport which she carries for work, and the guy still barely agreed to give her a beer. He lectured about expired ids while he literally took 2 minutes to pour the slowest poured  beers I've ever laid witness to. Let it go, guy. We got the picture. I even offered to just forget the beers if he was really THAT uncomfortable or afraid of getting in trouble over serving someone with A PASSPORT as id. He said no it's ok and then kept lecturing as he took a full minute to make change for us. Seriously had to walk away in the middle of his sentence because I felt like I was a kid again, getting lectured by my dad about learning to behave for the baby sitter.

They have set up a second grill outside to help with the line.  Personally, ordering instead is worth the wait.   One of the best things about this place is the bacon on their burgers.  Most places just throw a couple slices on the burger.  Not Chuck Box.  They have preformed pieces that are the shape of your burger.  This way, there is bacon in every bite.  YUM!    Little known fact: they will add slices of green chile to your burger.  Just be aware they are actual slices, not chopped green chile so it will be slippery and add to the mess factor.  Be ready for the following things: cash only, parking sucks, and there may be a line (ESPECIALLY before games) so go early.",

But that craziness pays off in a remarkably charred patty, that has been licked with smoke and fire, after it has been cooked on a well seasoned grate.  It is one of those thin patties that one might expect to be brown all the way through.  But not here.  Not even after the patty has shrunk to over half of it's original size.    For what it's worth, this place reminds me of a dirtier desert version of Clown Alley in San Francisco.  Fries are crisp.  We got the chicken strips for the little one, and they were well seasoned, and came out literally still sizzling with oil.  I would certainly consider eating some of their other fried foods.  My only nit is that I do wish they had rings of raw onion, instead of the large chunks of onion pieces.  I LOVE raw onion on my burgers, and these were just an unfortunate shape.  Either smaller or larger would have done the trick.    On the plus side, I have to admit, I love a place that is so committed to cheap beer that the best things on tap are Budweiser and Michelob.  It was cold.  It was cheap.  It went great with my burger.  And naturally they sell it by the pitcher.",

    "text": "I decided to try this place out based on the recommendations of multiple people.  Met a friend there around 5 PM.  I was happy to find on site parking available which is rare for that area of Tempe! (FYI:The parking lot has multiple signs stating that the lot is reserved for The Chuck Box and the tattoo parlor next door.  I wouldn't advise parking there and walking to a different business because they will tow your car.) I ordered The Big One with Cheese and a side of fries.  I was hoping to have a beer with that but the selection was very limited so I opted for water.  The food was so so.  I was expecting the burger to be amazing based off of what people had told me.  It was decent, for the price, but nothing to rave about.  Even with all of that, i would have gone back to try something else on the menu had it not been for the horrible customer service i received!! I have to say that the young lady who took our order was very patient and sweet. She didn't rush us while we were trying to make up our minds and she shared her suggestions with us.  The problem came when after i had ordered my fries, (had a hard time deciding between fries and onion rings) i heard my friend say she was ordering a combo.  I then said \"oh! That's an option? I'll take the combination too!\" thinking that meant it would be a combo of fries and onion rings.  Well when we got to the fry cook i saw that it was fried zucchini and mushrooms. I told the gentleman that i had ordered a combo of fries and onion rings. He replied, with an attitude, that this was not an option.  Being that I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms i was trying to think of a solution. I said fine I'll take the zucchini, mushroom combo.  The fry cook says that there are extra fries there and to take some if i want.  I then said that was fine as long as i didn't have to pay for an extra side.  He then rolls his eyes at me, hollers over to the cashier while pointing at me, telling him not to charge me for the fries.  Thinking I'd still be getting the zucchini/mushroom combo, i paid for my meal and proceeded to visit their condiment bar for burger toppings. The cashier told me that he would bring me the combo but never did.  The fries ended up being undercooked as well! I can understand that it was my misunderstanding that caused the confusion, but there was definitely a much better way to handle the situation than to be dismissive and rude.  Because of this, i will not be dining there again.",

Make sure to walk further into the restaurant so that the worker knows you aren't ready to order and so that you won't block the way of other customers who are trying to get in line.",

The university-adjacent location means that parking can be difficult, waits can be lengthy, and seating can be impossible. Stop in when they're not too busy however, and you'll be glad you did. Pro tip: they will add a grilled green chile or a grilled pineapple to any sandwich! Cash only.",

Helpful hints:  It is cash only so be prepared to bring cash or use the ATM inside. Parking is very limited with only about 10 spots available and this is a popular place. Finally, don't be shy about your order. During busy times, they will call out down the line and you shout out your order to the cooks at the grill. Just speak loud and clear. It can be kind of fun.

And make no mistake about it: in addition to old school that isn't good old-school-- this place is a dump. It's just old and dirty.   God, they're so full of themselves at  The Chuckle Box.   Chuck Box people think they are above it all.  Let me school YOU: there is \"good\" old school and there is really tired old school.  Durants in Phoenix is both, actually, but still good old school. The Chuck Box is really, really tired old school.   They didn't even toast the Aunt Hattie's bun well enough.  It was on the grill-- I saw it there; just not for long enough.   They knew enough to know that an Aunt Hattie's is a good pun but sending it off out of the package, 6 seconds on the grill I don't think is what a burger joint does. And less they don't care.   Let me not embellish: 5 better? Tempe burgers   1) Steak & Shake is a much better burger.  Much.  Better.  2) Freddy's 3) Fatburger 4) Ted's 5) The Habit",

Seriously bring everyone who is visiting Arizona  here every single time and everyone loves this place. It's been around for years and you can tell from when you walk in. Don't expect it to be fancy at all everything is paper plates and Styrofoam cups for soda.

Apparently you order and wait at the grill until your burger is ready before going to the cashier to pay.

We often went there after Rugby practice for a burger and beers. Drinking age was 18 then.  We sat on the porch to enjoy the views...  Lots of Hotties walking by.  Whatever your sex and orientation, who find street watching a pleasure.  Whenever I visit, I stop by for a burg and beer, annual trip.  Great place to eat before a football game.

Very much a neighborhood bar feel with TVs for catching a game, and the chairs are essentially boxes. It can get pretty packed especially on a weekend when school is in session. Parking is very limited.  Come in, grab a tray, order, move down the line, and pay. They have chicken sandwiches and burgers (they even have a veggie burger), grilled on a flat top before your eyes. You can add bacon and your choice of cheese. No nickel and diming you over additional toppings; there is a free toppings bar in the center of the restaurant with your standard LTOP and condiments. I ordered a big one with pepper jack and onion rings. The rings took a few minutes to make, but they were fresh and delicious. I tried my fiance's fries. They were thick cut and okay, nothing special. Fountain drinks and a few decent choices in draft beer are available.  Prices are very fair. Note this is a cash-only establishment. As someone who never carries cash, I find this perturbing. The cash-only thing seems to work with their casual neighborhood joint image, but dudes, I see kids selling lemonade in their front yard using Square readers nowadays. Get with the times! They do have an ATM, but you're sure to pay a hefty fee for using it if your bank isn't cool enough to waive those.",

The food is cooked over an open flame while you watch. The place is always packed, so I recommend going either for an early lunch or late lunch to avoid the crowd. Its cash only, so plan ahead and bring cash. There is an ATM, but there's an ATM fee, so its better to just bring cash.  update: If you've never been, this place, GO. Its rustic/cowboy themed. You walk in, shout your order over a noisy crowd packed in the small building. Then watch your food get cooked over a wood burning fire. Once you pay (with cash), then you can pile on toppings at the self-serve toppings bar. There's indoor and outdoor seating. Also, there is beer on tap and free soda refills.  This is the ONE restaurant that I frequent that has never disappointed me, even in the slightest way.",

I truly don't understand the hype. It's okay but nothing spectacular. However, the onion rings are fantastic!  The staff is usually rude, I've only been once where I think someone was pleasant. The burgers aren't cooked to order. The condiments are all sitting out and for some reason it bothers me. Don't know why really, it just looks...off...like I can see people waiting in line and I get this irrational idea that people are just standing there...breathing on everything. I don't know! Also the reason for a two star verses three star review is that they don't take debit or credit cards but instead have a lovely little ATM that is expensive. It's 2013, almost 2014 actually, stop taking a stand or making whatever statement you're trying to make and just get a card machine.",

The toppings bar is off to the side so you can add whatever you like and add as little or as much as you like.

    "text": "Honestly, I will not let Norm ruin my, one third of a century long, love of Chuck Box burgers and would come back and eat here again. But if nothing else, maybe somebody should talk to Norm about not treating customers badly. SO here is what we went through.  I have been coming to this place for the last 33 years. THE FOOD NEVER DISAPPOINTS. Great tasting burgers. So the two star rating is NOT for the food. (That deserves five stars)  I am a creature of habit so I always order the same items. The Little One (it used to be the Big One but I'm older now) on white with jalapeno jack cheese, french fries and mushrooms.  My friends and family always want to go to the Chuck Box when they visit from out of town. This evening was just such an occasion. I have family visiting so we went there. No disappointment in the food......except when Norm tried to pull a fast one on us. Other than about six people already dotted around the dining room there was no one there. So we placed our order, and moved up to get ourselves our drinks and wait.   We watched the cook, start the beef patties on the grill and throw the mushrooms and onion rings into the fryer. After watching him for a few minute, I thought maybe he had not heard my order of the fries, so I mentioned that I wanted fries as well.   Suddenly Norm appeared from somewhere and said that he had them. He proceeded to get some older already cooked fries out from the tray next to the fryer, threw them, with an attitude, into the fryer, and pulled them out after 15 seconds. He then put them into a couple of paper fries envelopes and placed them under the heat lamp.   We were a little concerned with this. Then a minute before our food was ready Norm threw in two batches of frozen fries into the fryer. I looked at that and thought, \"OK so we don't have to have the re-fried fries\". So a few minutes later when our burgers, mushrooms and onion rings were ready we collected them and moved to pay.   Norm rang us up and asked why we did not take the fries. So we said that we would like to have the freshly fried fries and we could wait for those. So he got upset and said that he had made those fresh just for us and the new batch was being made fresh for the new people that had walked in after us and if he gave us those new ones then he would have to make more for them.   So I stood there trying to understand if Norm is a liar, or if he actually believes that taking already fried cold fries and throwing them into hot oil for a few seconds makes them fresh or maybe he does not actually know that we were standing in front of the fryer watching him and the cook the whole time. I finally said that I did not want the fries he was offering us, so he promptly picked them up and threw them into the garbage. (If they were so fresh why did he not just give them to people who were right behind us in line?)  Anyway for the first time in the three decades that I have been eating here I was disappointed by the service here.",

With a medium drink added to that I was just a few cents north of $9. Not a bad deal when you get the satisfaction of seeing the actual ground beef patty being grilled in front of you. Everything was delicious again!!   In a world that seems to be into the shi shi burger bars like Delux and Zinburger, it's great to still have an old fashioned burger joint like this around.

I went to the zoo with my son then did a little hiking and then went to the Chuck box. It was actually recommended by a friend, and I saw good reviews on yelp, so I thought I just want to get a good burger and would try it out.   It's a fun place, to begin with. Simple - - paper plates, you actually sit on boxes, no fancy-schmancy service. But, friendly. It is cash only. If you don't figure this out by the various cash only signs posted as you order the food, you're kind of dense . There is an ATM in the facility.  Stand in line order your food and wait in the same line. It gets a little crowded in the line, but You get to watch your food getting grilled over the hot coals. I had a bacon cheeseburger, delicious. My son had a hotdog and it was served on a hamburger bun, they sliced it into multiple sections. There's a help yourself condiment bar with all the Fixin's, including ranch dressing which is a must for my son while he dips the onion rings.  You go to the Chuck box for just a good old delicious charbroiled burger, and a hole in the wall atmosphere. Clean restaurant. And the place was packed. I'm giving this four stars because it's what I expected. Just a good burger. I've had better burgers at some places, so I'm reserving a five for the best of the best. But I'd go to Chuck box again anytime, and plan on taking other people there. Hope this helps",

    "text": "This is the type of place that exists in practically every college town in the country and hopefully will continue for the foreseeable future. There's nothing fancy about The Chuck Box. They do burgers, chicken sandwich You come in, line up, and get ready to place your order because they don't wait until you're at the counter, instead you get to yell it across the entire restaurant and watch as they don't write anything down, but instead mark the buns with an intricate system of toothpicks, that might be the restaurant version of a semaphore code. Somehow it works though as everyone gets their order and the food is ready (or nearly ready) by the time you get to the front of the line. Also, even though it seems really busy, there's almost a table available once you have your food, although the system can be messed up by people who insist on sitting down while other members of their party get the food.  So next time you're on the ASU campus and you want a genuine college experience, go to The Chuck Box. Oh, and bring cash... they don't take any other form of payment.",

They have many options for burgers and a variety of cheeses and other toppings that you put on yourself.  I chose the bacon cheeseburger and it was delicious. The onion rings are worth the wait too.  This is not going to be the biggest burger you have ever had,  but it is tasty and honestly I could not finish mine so I was very happy with the value. This is a busy place- you wait while your burger is cooked, so guess what... it is fresh! Seating is casual with a western decor and you can sit outside as well.  Parking is the biggest challenge, but if you are hungry you will find a spot. And as everyone else has said-CASH ONLY!",

The burger was awesome and tasted like a real home cooked burger.a nice refreshing taste aside from the other fast food joints and bulk processed fooderies. My only issue would be that there wasn't enough uniqueness to their food. The jalapeno poppers were pretty good and enough to come by, but the flavor was definitely lacking. This is a place you could go every once in a while to grab a quick bite away from other places you'd normally eat at for lunch. Ps. Parking is horrendous.",

    "text": "When my dad went to ASU in the 1970s, he would often swing by the Chuck Box for a burger and fries. The prices might have increased a bit in the last [almost] five decades since this establishment opened, but here it stands. Burgers cooked to perfection on a mesquite grill; the only setup of its kind in Tempe (and, to my knowledge, in the greater surrounding area).   When I moved to Tempe in 2017, the first place I went to for lunch was the Chuck Box. A kind of \"passing the torch\" ensued, as my dad no longer lives in Arizona, so I get to extend his loyalties to these fantastic burgers.   Before writing my review, I had a little fun and searched for Yelp reviews that included the word \"rude\". Indeed, lots of results showed up!   So here's the deal. The Chuck Box is a fast-paced joint. Pretend like you have left Tempe as you open the door, only to find yourself in the middle of hectic Manhattan street during rush hour. With some fortune there will be a line leading to the grill, so that should give you ample time to check out the menu. If not, hopefully you know what you want!   Don't get me wrong. I do not defend or advocate for the innumerable occasions in which the staff came across as rude. Sometimes they'll take on several advance orders by hollering all the way down the line. This can be frustrating because now you've got to holler right back at them! I see it this way however....The customer service we know and love is not in evidence at the Chuck Box. The staff have one objective, and that is to make you a burger. You, the customer, have one objective: devour that burger.   I usually get the Big One with Swiss cheese and grilled pineapple. It's fascinating fun to observe, especially on the busy days, how well the crew coordinates large numbers of burger orders. Oftentimes there's over a dozen patties sizzling above the charcoal, each being cooked just right and in single file. As you wait, you can grab a drink at the soda fountain, and if you've ordered fries or some other side, they'll have it ready near the cash register. When it's time to pay, bear in mind they only accept cash, so have some on hand.   Congratulations! You have successfully traversed the madness that is the Chuck Box line. Now, dress your burger at the condiments island if you wish, and pull up a stool. Understand that this is not gourmet food. It is a backyard burger from the most memorable barbecue you enjoyed at the park. Remember that? The Chuck Box is a simple place-- a bit of Arizona history. If you're in the mood for an early lunch or a late-night dinner, they've got you covered.   According to my old man, the place looks just as he remembers it, and he is fondly reminded of his college days. For me, I treat each burger as tribute to the both of us Sun Devils, and my respects for this long-standing mainstay of Tempe.",

If you want to avoid the crowd, eat outside regular meal hours. If you don't, you will run into a line. Even if there is a line, it goes pretty fast.  When you enter, head towards the grill where the cook will take your order. The system behind that grill is a well oiled machine and fascinating to watch!! I always pay attention whenever I go.   Everything is a la carte but I usually spend a little over $11 for a Big One, fries, and a soda. I believe it's over $8 without the drink.   Let me tell you about the FOOD!!! I don't know what they do, but it's out of this world! The burger is perfection, the fries are on point...even the fountain drinks are mixed with the right level of flavor and carbonation.   I highly recommend trying this place!",

There are a variety of sizes of burger depending on your appetite. You can even order stacks of patties if you are really hungry!

Extra tomatoes? You got it! Ha, I love a burger with extra tomatoes!   The burger has a nice char and has good flavor. I don't necessarily think the burger is amazing but they get all the marks for consistency, local business and a condiment bar.

    "text": "Everyone knows when you drive-thru ASU off University Boulevard and you smell the scent of the grill, it's coming from the Chuckbox that's making burgers to order.   Been coming here for years and while I was in Tempe the family had a cravin for a burger. Decided to skip the chain spots and give them a new experience. Great conversation about the importance of college & college life, friends and being on campus. When we walked in the kids truly did enjoy the entire experience from the time that they waited in line to place an order. Funny line... if the place is packed, then we know it's good\" they said to me. We ordered up the Big One with bacon or 2 Little Ones with jalapeno cheese along with some fries and drinks. It was packed, but that's didn't hinder anyone. If you got OCD tendency's, then rest assure that Juan and company have a science to the madness for ordering & paying so you only need to call out what you want one time and the register will do the rest. Let's just call it \"organized chaos\"   The bar of condiments ranges with all the standards you can think of and you load up, but do it within reason as everyone is making their way to get the burger \"their way\".   Seating both inside and outside opens up pretty quick so you don't have to have someone grab a seat while you wait, but if you have a larger group then you may want to. If your like most, driving to the location has limited parking in the 2 lots but typically someone will point you over to the alley area.   I've always enjoyed coming to this place so make sure you have cash in hand if not there's an ATM that's available for you ($2 fee). No cards or the line would be out the door & around the corner!!!",

I've worked in the credit card processing industry, and the thing that most consumers don't know, is that when all is said and done, the business (if they're lucky) pays an average of $0.20 cents and 2.5% of the total charge to the credit card industry every time you use your credit card.  That means, that on a $5 burger, it would cost Chuck Box $0.33 cents if you used your card.  That's over 6% of the tab.  Personally, because of the cost of using a credit card to the business, I try to only use a credit card when there's a corporate owner (and believe me, they get much lower processing rates)  Anyways, love the burgers, especially the quac/bacon/cheese burger.  Ok fried 'shrooms, and they have a surprisingly good chili.  I've gone in JUST for the chili and a beer at times  The only real complaint I have about the place is that they open so late on Sundays.  When I lived nearby, there were many a hungover Sunday morning where I knew the only thing that would save my life was some Chuck Box.  Dare to dream that they'd stay open 24/7 . . .",

Some people might not like their patties because it is only grounded beef. Seasoned salt is the only seasoning added while the patties is grilled. However, since it was grilled with charcoal, the meat has better aroma. In addition, you can ask for extra toppings on your burger like grilled bacon stripped, just look at their menu for further extra toppings. For the condiment, you are free to choose because they have a table full of condiment.   The problem with chuck box is inconsistency due to who is in charge of cooking the patties. I cannot give this place more than 2 out of 5 because I have tasted better burger than their burger. Yet, I like to go to their place for lunch because I like charcoal aroma on my meat.",

We took friends here and they were blown away. It looks intimidating because it is a small old building in the heart of downtown Tempe, however it is a landmark and the service and prices are excellent. Parking is $2 across the street at the pay lot which is not bad considering what parking costs elsewhere. Be prepared for a long line out the door because everyone knows this is the go-to place for a hearty delicious burger and fries. The line says it all - they know what they are doing and people are willing to wait. Everything is cooked on an open wood fire grill and worth the time it takes to get your meal.

It was served on a regular bun instead of the torpedo roll on the menu. This burger was really juicy and cooked perfectly. The slight flavor of mesquite smoke was really nice too. Didn't really taste the chilies that much though.   It took a while for it to come out though. I saw 2 people order the great big one after me (separate times) and they still got their food before me. Had fun seeing the huge bursts of flame as the burgers grilled over the open fire. I don't recommend the fries though, pretty small portion size and not especially good either. Parking in their lot is really hard too.  I'd come back for another burger though. That's saying a lot since I'm notoriously cheap and a $6 burger is \"expensive\" to me. I'm now going to start a quest to find the best burger in the area after finally trying this legendary place.",

    "text": "Don't want to wait for a waiter, then The Chuck Box is the place for you as long as you don't mind a line.  To order you queue up in a line by the front door where a gentleman will take your order from their simple, yet good menu hanging overhead. You then walk cafeteria style to the end of the grill where you pick up your tray of food and pay. This makes for a great in and out style of eating while getting higher quality food than take out.  From my experience I would say they have good burgers and fries.  I also love their chicken strips as long as they don't come back over done.  Last recommendation is the fried zucchini.  Hope you enjoy!",

The portion size is very good and you place your own toppings so how can you go wrong.  This place has been there forever serving the Big Juan and has been successful so they must be doing something right. That something right is their Wood Grill that perfectly cooks your burger to order.",

With that being said, you open the door, stand in line and order.  As you approach the grill, you see your order cooking as you wait for it. Then you slide on down to the beverage station and get a drink. (I do believe they sell beer here)  After you pay and try to find a table you can than add your CONDIMENTS!  The Condiment Bar is always FRESH! You name it they have it!  If you don't do burgers that's OK too, they also have Hot Dogs and VEGGIE burgers!  Small menu - Big appetite!  Try to go after lunch around 1:30 and avoid on the weekends, especially since this is in college town Tempe.  Enjoy and let me know what you think when you try them out ;)",

Every time I come back to visit Tempe, I have to make a stop here. The bacon cheeseburger was my personal favorite. After all, who doesn't love circular bacon? Everything is made right in front of you, it's a lot of fun to watch. One of the trademarks from the cooks is to yell 'FRIES\" if you order them. There's a condiment bar where you can put your own stuff on your burger. The Big One is also a popular choice. I loved the BBQ chicken sandwich as well.   Burgers are very reasonably priced, everything is made to how you want it. They serve beer to wash everything down with as well. It is cash only, but they do have an ATM inside. Parking lot is a little small and it can get very crowded at lunch time. Best to go when ASU is not in session or on the weekends when students are too hungover to go for lunch. But if you're looking for any burgers not named McDonalds or In-N-Out, then this is absolutely the place",

I don't have any really weird requirements I just prefer to eat things that are natural, not chemically altered mutations. That being said Chuckbox uses healthy oils (still fattening but not mutated) for their French fries and it is fabulous to indulge in that sinful pleasure. Their burgers are made of the highest quality meat and cooked to order (yes even rare) on a huge wood burning grill. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. If you are a True foodie I know you have already discovered this Tempe gem but if you haven't get in your car and head there ASAP. You will thank me profusely for this review. I would give them 10 stars if I could. One thing before you go, bring cash, they do not take credit cards. Enjoy!!!!!",

In fact, for some of them Chuckbox is so special that it can only be had on Fridays for lunch. As such, I was kind of excited to see what the hype was about.  Ordering your food is really simple, their menu is really basic and its easy to figure out what you want to eat. Even though I don't care much for the white or wheat dilemma, I still thought it was cool that they offered such a choice. But I like to be old fashioned, \"Big one\" + fries and a cup of water. You can smell Chuckbox from a mile away sometimes because they are grilling ridiculous amounts of meat. The aroma is extraordinary, and you would probably forget that you're in the scorching AZ sun.   Once you actually get your burger you pay, cash only, and take your sandwich to the condiments bar. They have pretty much all the basics you'd want in your burger. They even have extra lettuce and ranch, which equates to a free salad. Are you winning yet?  Overall, the burgers were extremely flavorful, and it was plenty of food for the money. The only downside is that beef patties were frozen and that takes away from some of the flavor. Its not that I have anything personal against frozen beef, it just doesn't have the same juicyness as something that's not frozen. For this same reason, I think it loses a star. Other than that, its a perfect burger joint.",

I order the same thing pretty much every time - the regular grilled chicken sandwich with cheddar cheese. Their topping bar is great too so you can help yourself. I typically get lettuce, tomato, onions, & mayonnaise. Their sides are good - my favorite is the onion rings but I've also tried the fries (sometimes a little salty), fried zucchini, & fried mushrooms. This restaurant also has delicious ranch dipping sauce which is one of my favorites for food like this. The line is almost always really long but well worth the wait. It's fun to watch them cook your food in front of you & they serve it cafeteria style. I will say however that a couple of times, when we've ordered our sides, they've gotten a bit cold or have been taken, especially since the wait is a bit longer for chicken to cook than the burgers. The prices are pretty reasonable & it's a great hang out place as well for groups.",

They have atms inside but they require a surcharge which annoys me.  I ordered the big juan (1/3 lb burger) with a side of onion rings.  While I was waiting for my food I noticed the topping bar, consisting of your typical burger toppings.  This is a nice plus because you can really have it how you want it.  I got my food fairly quick after watching them grill my burger in front of me.  After i got my cheeseburger, I put lettuce, tomato, onions, mayo and jalapenos.  I took my first bite and thought it was very good.  However my second bite I noticed it wasn't quite as good.  My third it was very average.  By my forth bite I was tired of it.  I don't know what it was but it just did not taste that special to me.  The meat itself just did not taste great.  Also the onion rings were very average.  Not bad but not sure if I would recommend them.  Overall my first experience at the Chuck Box was a bit of a disappointment.  I came in with people hyping this place up so much with one person even saying \"best burger ever eaten.\"  Maybe I came in with too high of expectations.  Maybe I just came in on a bad day.  Maybe its just not my place.  Overall Chuck Box was not bad, but I do not understand all the hype.",

The building is small and dark, but this isn't a place you go for ambiance...just grub down man!    The guys behind the grill were very helpful and are efficient with their jobs.   The greatest thing about this place is how cheap it is.  We were able to get EXCELLENT burgers, fries and drinks for what it would have cost to go to a chain joint and order their top end burger.

The burgers are brilliant and/or life changing and cheap. It's simple. Not exactly 5 star atmosphere, but you're not going for a classy place with candles, ties or suits. Hell, they have potato sacks on the ceiling. The place isn't pretty at all. If anything it's reminiscent of a sty. Still, you're not going there because it's pretty, you're going there because they have some burgers that can make you squeal with joy and push the limits of your belt buckle. These burgers set precedent for all burgers everywhere. It's part of the college experience at ASU.",

I've had people recommend the veggie burger, the big one, the chicken, but i love love love the hotdog. I seriously can't get enough backdoor BBQ but in the winter that's incredibly difficult to come by. Unless you know about the Chuck box. If this place doesn't give you the warm fuzzy feeling of summer and the forth of July grilling, nothing will.  Beware, they only except cash, and the line is very difficult to get into from the east door. The seats are uncomfortable, the other customers are awful, and the busy times last for hours upon hours, but it's all worth it, I promise. I would wait three hours for a roller coaster, and I would wait four hours for the food at this place. Enjoy!",

    "text": "You have probably driven past this joint a dozen times without even thinking about it.  Next time, make the stop.  The Mustache loves a good greasy spoon, and this is a prime example.  It's a tiny shack with a charcoal fire roaring at one end.  A condiment counter sits in the center of an eating area that is little more than boxes turned sideways for sitting, and tables left with \"gifts\" from the folks who sat there previously.  You see, the place gets so busy with seats at such a premium that there isn't time for staff to clean tables in between when folks leave and you sit down.  The burgers are juicy and flavorful, with that \"dusty\" charcoal flavor incorporated within them.  The buns are thick and over-the-counter, probably Aunt Hattie's or similar.  Fries are tasty and thrown at you piping hot.  There are also options like fried zucchini or fried mushrooms, but who wants vegetables?!  This brings up a pair of side points...vegetarian options are a no-go here.  There are plenty of places in Tempe that will offer vegetarian or vegan meals, this should not be seen as one of them.  In related health news, the smoke from the charcoal pit frequently overwhelms the smoke-ejection system and backs up into the restaurant itself.  If you have respiratory problems or are otherwise fearful of breathing in occasionally-thick barbecue smoke, you can choose outdoor eating or just take your food to go.  A member of my party reported stinging eyes from the smoke, though to me it just felt like a fun backyard barbecue with all of the smoky aromas included.  The ordering process is old-school.  You enter and immediately form a line to your right, which snakes in front of the cooking area.  Your order is shouted at whomever is behind the counter, he in turn shouts it to the cook, who shouts something back to him, he then shouts to you to walk to the register and stop holding up the line.  Yeah, it's a bit daunting for a newbie.  All the shouting and confusion take you back to your first baseball practice as a child.  You'll quickly snap out of it at the register, where you'll pay in cash and then go about the business of finding a seat.  At lunchtime, this is a very difficult task.  Note that seats by the door offer you better ventilation from the aforementioned smoke problem, but will crowd you with folks lining up to order their food.  Condiments are sitting at a central counter, you can load up on them to your palate's delight.  Fifteen minutes later you are fat and happy, and your arteries are begging for mercy.  But that's what a good burger joint is all about, isn't it?",

    "text": "This is a landmark in Tempe and a mecca for ASU Students.   The original place for building your own burger. Order the different size burgers and then add on your own fixings of lettuce,  tomatoes, onions, pickles, etc.  The burgers do not sit under a heat lamp and are placed on the grill after you tell them which size or how many patties. So you have a fresh burger and toasted bun which is placed on a paper plate. Great grilled taste and add customize to your liking.  We also ordered fries, onion rings and deep fried mushrooms which were all prepared well.  They also have hot dogs and other items but you have to come here for the burgers.  When in Tempe or asu this is a must and then 20 years when you come back it will be almost the same with a little extra in price but not enough to have to break the piggy bank.",

The condiments is what makes the burger really n i got the biggest burger 1/2 lb. N the meat was pretty big but the bun was like ummmm we need more bread.lol , i did like the fried zucchini it was delish, onion rings were good to++the setting inside is small but pretty cool. Service was fairly fast n polite a plus. I think the prices were a lil high for the burgers n the xtras ,bacon,avocado,chilli etc. If u never been I'd try once n see how u feel.",

They have a perfect list of toppings for your burger without it being overwhelming. We went around noon on a Tuesday while school was not in session. No wait and just enough room for me and my 5 coworkers. I can imagine it's probably busier during the school year.   I got the The Big One with cheese, bacon and green chile and a side of fries. It was the perfect size for me for lunch. I couldn't get over how amazing the flavor was on the burger. I'm still thinking about it three days later. The fries were good but nowhere near the star. I would've been fine without them. But that burger. Mmmmm. I can't wait to go back!!  PS - It's cash only but they do have an ATM on-site. Also, it's very affordable!",

It has a similar vibe to the Original Hamburger Works, with a wagon full of condiments and a similar order, watch them grill your burger, pay setup. The place looks old, which I guess is part of it's appeal. They only accept cash for payment, which is kind of lame in this day and age.  The burger itself was good. Good like a home-cooked burger on the grill would be. For $8 and some change, I'm not in a rush to hurry back here, but I won't say that I'll never return.

We went around 12:30 and didn't have any trouble finding parking but it was Memorial Day so there were less people around.  The seats inside were all full so that's usually a good sign.  We waited in line to order - they cook your food right there in front of you.  We actually saw them lift up the grill and stir up the charcoal underneath - pretty cool.  Burgers were made exactly as we ordered and they were legit!  Absolutely delicious - best burger I've had in quite a while.  They only take cash so be prepared.  (If you're not prepared they do have an ATM inside.)  They have a condiment bar after you pay which is where you add whatever you want to your burger (ketchup, mustard, mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickles, etc).  We sat outside on the patio (they have misters so it wasn't overly hot) and enjoyed our burgers.  It was a really good lunch and under $10 for the burger and fries.  Would definitely come here again!",

It's at the box  Not gonna get me a Burger King That sort of burger don't mean anything Not gonna get me a In-and-Out Cause, you've got my shining Yelp star  Not gonna get me a Mckey burger I guy like me needs something real I wanna get me something that'll hit my heart Something special man!  It's at the Chuck Box It's at the Chuck Box man It's at the Chuck Box Ohh, It's at the Chuck Box man  Where should I start!?  Hmmm...  Well I was told to come here years ago from a friend, but never traveled my way down to the Mills Ave. much anymore since I'm way past my 20's.  However, it was always on my mind and now; Bam! I did it!    The Chuck Box I guess has been around for ages, not my age apparently.  The place itself is a dive.  Made out to look like it's right out of a pioneer wagon with boxes as chairs.  Seating is limited so arrive and be prepared to wait or pickup and go.  The burgers are made from scratch literally.  It's a \"build your own burger\" place so add toppings by asking the chef.  Overall, the burger is perfect.  Best firewood grill burger I've had!  Mesquite firewood is what they used. The burger is nice and juicy with a smokey scent!  I went lightly on the toppings since the burger itself is so big!  Ordered me a side of zucchini fries and I'm golden!    In the end, I can be a burger snob, but The Chuck Box impressed me.  I don't care for \"build your burger\" places, but I'll let this one pass with an A grade. - Enjoy",

There was a long line to order and they take your order while your in line. It's almost somewhat like a cafeteria style. Wait til your burgers are ready then you can pick up everything else like drinks, onion rings, and fries. Also, cash only. There is a sign that says they take cash only so they can get the line moving faster. They do have a ATM machine by the ordering line. LOL  We ordered the Great Big One which is a 1/2 pound with american cheese and wheat bun. My wife got the chicken breast on wheat bun. They charcoal grill your burgers and chicken right in front of you. It's amazing that one guy is grilling and can remember everyone's order. Really good memory.   Once you get your burger then you go to the condiment bar to put your own condiments that you want.   The burger was really good. Love the charcoal grill taste. Very juicy and tasty. Also, tried by wife's chicken breast and it was very moist and tasty.  We both enjoyed our burger and chicken.  They give you a small order of fries but they were good.

If you have been searching your whole life for a box that serves chuck, the name doesn't lie, look no further.  In close proximity to Arizona State University, the Chuck Box fills that niche for a homesick student looking for some of daddy's buggers made on the grill.  No need to wait for the weekend, the onion rings are also great and the condiment bar is free range just like at home.  You can order you burger by the size or by non-free topping or you can get chicken.  There is also outdoor seating if you don't mind sitting on a stump.",

First of all, BRING CASH - no cards accepted. There was a small setback while we were waiting for the food to be cooked, however the staff handled it very well and quickly picked up the slack. My boyfriend got the Tijuana Torpedo with green chilies on top. It was great. So were the onion rings, perfectly cooked! Wash it all down with a lemonade = VERY REFRESHING! I can't wait to go back. With all of those toppings, I'm sure even the garden burger would be delicious! (Not that I don't like garden burgers; I do! I just didn't think it would be the best representation of the Chuck Box.)",

No floofy brioche bun with sundried tomatoes and blah blah blah. The meat has great flavor from the charcoal and mesquite and you can get a 1/3 lb Big Juan and still have change from a 5.  And the condiment bar is fantastic. I can put tons of tomatoes just because I want to and there's lettuce, onions, and ranch dressing too so you can make your own little side salad.   Now there's lots of other options by ASU like smashburger, five guys, fatburger, etc, but when I have a hankering for a good burger, Chuckbox is the place to go.",

    "text": "My boyfriend's sister goes to ASU and has an apartment in Tempe so when our first choice of lunch ended up not being in the location I remembered, (Dave's Dog House) she suggested coming to the Chuck Box to have their \"amazing burgers.\" We got there a little after lunch rush which was nice because it wasn't crowded at all. There was a line of people but the cook seemed to get every order spot on.   For sides we asked for two french fry baskets and onion rings. I filled my drink and was waiting for my food when a younger guy who was behind us in line walked in front of me to grab his burger, and took our order of onion rings. At first I assumed he had asked for some as well and since his order was for one person, and ours for three, I figured it took less time for his to be done. But as I waited to see if any more onion rings were being fried up, no one started them. I mentioned this to the cashier and he told me that this happens often and it doesn't really matter because you pay for everything at the register when you get to the end so it's not like people walk away with your food free. Still he had to ask the cook to put in a new batch of rings and it took a minute or two. Obviously I should be taking stars away from that oh so respectful gentleman that needed onion rings in a hurry, but he is probably out playing beer pong or tubing down the salt river.   The food is amazing to say the least. Fries could have been crunchier but hey you can't win em' all. The condiment buffet was surprisingly free of flies even though the doors swing open frequently.   Will be back sometime soon, and hopefully keep a better eye on what I order!",

They cook the meat right in front of their customers-- no heat lamp burgers here. They also have delicious fried zucchini and fried mushrooms(which aren't exactly easy to find in the Phoenix area). All in all, it's really nice to sit out on the patio with lunch and enjoy the nice weather in spring or fall.  The problem isn't the food. And until the last time I visited, I had excellent service. The cooks and the man running the register were polite and friendly. But when I walked into their restaurant wearing something a bit odd(and not nearly as odd and some of the things I've seen walking around campus; do note that the Chuckbox is RIGHT NEXT TO A COLLEGE CAMPUS), I was immediately, loudly mocked in a way I've not seen since junior high by the guys running the grill. I couldn't believe it. Maybe I can't take a joke. Maybe that's just their brand of devil-may-care small-business-running. But I know I can do better than a burger place where I as a paying customer am ridiculed.",

    "text": "We all have our favorite burger haunts, and the Chuck Box is a favorite of mine, especially since it was one of the first, well, dives I ever went to for a burger.  I finally got a chance to go back there after several years' absence.  I'm sure that when it was built (which I don't know when that was, the Box was a veteran burger joint when our family moved to Arizona in the early 80s), it was on the north side of Arizona State University, but as ASU has grown, it's probably more accurate to say that it's now kind of in the middle of ASU.  In any case, the Chuck Box is basically a burger shack, emphasis on the shack. It's old gnarled wood, and it sports a definite sloppiness in construction that's the hallmark of a \"shack\". Actually, sometime in the 80s I remember the place had a bit of a makeover, in which they added some windows (greatly increasing the light level), added some ventilation (greatly reducing the smoke level from the grill), and removed a lot of the accumulated crap on the walls and ceiling. I think I liked it better before, but I'm not a building code enforcer, either.  But, even though the random mementos on the wall are interesting (including such oddities as a picture of Ronald McDonald signed \"Even Ronald likes to go to the Box!\"), the real features of the Chuck Box are the several foot long charcoal grill, several Frialators, and a big giant condiment bar (that says \"Have it your way... but play fair!\"). Basically, it's all about having a grilled sandwich, with the main features being the \"Big One\" 1/3 lb burger, and the \"Great Big One\" 1/2 lb burger. They also have a variety of grilled chicken sandwiches and the like. All the burgers are available on white or wheat buns, with several cheeses (including pepper jack), bacon, or even fried peppers.  Finally, you can round out your burger with the free condiments bar. Nothing terribly elaborate here, but it's got a decent array of your basic burger toppings (onions, pickles, pickled jalapenos, mustard, etc).  Pros:  1. This is a seriously good charbroiled burger done right. I opted for my normal, a Big One with swiss and grilled peppers, with a bunch of onions, mustard, and jalapeno piled on.  2. Free well-stocked condiment bars should be the norm at any burger joint...  3. The fries (a.k.a. Chuckbox Potatoes) are quite good here, with a nice crunchy exterior and a mashed-potato-like interior. Seriously, I like the fries here.  Cons:  1. Being in the middle of ASU, parking can be an issue, and on occasion, it's pretty crowded.  2. If it's not sunny out, this place can be danker than Moe's Tavern.  All-in-all, I was glad to see that one of my favorite burgers for over 20 years is still a solidly dependable burger.",

    "text": "While cruising down University killing some time, my friend noticed The Chuck Box, and stated that we had to go there.  Other than the obvious mentioning of hamburgers, we had no idea what to expect, but based on the fact that it was a little wooden shack that was spouting smoke, we assumed it HAD to be good, and right up our alley.  Later that night after a Fall League baseball game, we decided that it was the perfect time to try The Chuck Box.  The parking is a little sparse, but there was space for me, so no complaints there.  The exterior is about as dive-y as I would have guessed, to no complaints there either.  Upon entering, the interior is total dive, wooden walls, tables, benches and stools.  No velvet ropes here, but a bigass chain to separate those in line with the rest of the customers.  I ordered a Big Juan, and savored the pleasant aroma of a slab of beef going onto the grill right before my eyes.  It was cooked perfectly to order, and I took my time at the condiment area to load it up with what I like.  But not too much to eliminate the flavor of the beef, which was cooked just right, still a little juicy, but nice and warm, with good natural flavor.  My only knock on it is the cash-only policy.  There is an ATM there, but typically I don't carry cash on me, but since I was being all touristy, I was prepared.  But that just meant I had to pay for my ill-prepared friend who was being too cheap to get decked with ATM surcharges.  Otherwise, The Chuck Box was a fantastic find, and well worth the experience, and was a fine burger overall.",

    "text": "The popularity of this place defies logic. The best explanation I can think of is the fact that it's been a staple of Tempe for about four decades. But the service is terrible and the burgers are mediocre.  The first time I went here, I thought it was just a bad night for the staff because I had heard such great things. I came here a second time and the staff was just as rude as before and the guy at the grill once again paid no mind to whose order belonged to whom, creating a cluster in the middle of the line of people waiting to get their food.   The first time I went, my order was wrong. I had to wait another few minutes for the guy to fry the bacon. I assume this is because he gave the other bacon burger to someone else (I saw someone walk away with one just as my oder was supposed to be finishing) because he just doesn't pay attention to any of the customers. The second time I went, another person almost walked off with my food again, but I said that I thought that order belonged to me. Only then did the guy at the grill look up and nod in agreement. Thanks, guy.  Another review here described an employee as \"bark(ing)\" at him. That seems about right. The cashier is no better. He's curt and doesn't seem to care at all about the fact that there's a line of people who want to give him money. I almost handed him my credit card the second time I went, forgetting that the place is cash only. The cashier gave me a disgusted look and pointed at the cash only sign. I had the cash, but why couldn't I get a simple, \"Sorry, we don't accept cards\"? Instead, I get the silent treatment and a look that suggests he couldn't care less where I take my business. Message received.  Some people assume if the food is from an independently owned shop, then it's better. Chuck Box proves this is not True. At 40 years old, the establishment has not expanded, probably because there are better options everywhere else you go in Arizona. Even in Tempe, fastfood chains Smashburger and Five Guys both have better burgers. I'm not a big In-N-Out guy, but I'd definitely eat there over Chuck Box. I've even been to McDonald's restaurants with better service than what I've seen here.  If independently owned places are your thing, there are plenty of other options for you in Tempe. Obviously there's Four Peaks. I also recommend Mac's Broiler & Tap at McClintock and Guadalupe. They have a good burger and beer special you can take advantage of and their food is delicious.",

The service...you walk in stand in line order your burger and sides and watch them make it. All fine and dandy it was very cool actually.  The food. I had the regular burger, and it was good. Great even, but from the heavenly experience my friend mentioned I wanted just a tiny bit more from the meat. (Yes make your jokes now.)  The fries were good, the onion rings were fantastic and their ranch dressing? Im gross but I could drink that stuff.  I want to go back and order the Tijuana torpedo...I think that may be what Im missing here to make this five stars. When I get back there I will update you guys!  It also doesn't hurt that its located right NEXT to Pop Culture Paradise (Sorry the Geek is showing)!",

If you're a person that likes to be cuddled and kissed up to just because you ordered food, this isn't the place for you.   If shouting your order to the order taker, over a crowd of people in line frightens you, this is not the place for you.   If you somehow thought eating a chuck box burger would bring inner peace or some semblance of meaning to your pathetic life, this is not the place for you.  If you want a simple burger, cooked the way you cook it in your backyard or out camping, and you're not afraid to assemble your own toppings, and you're just as comfortable sitting on a wooden box as you're sitting on a stack of tires or a log, this place is for you.",

Ambiance, decor: well, pull up a barrel stool and put the burger in your mouth and tell me that stuff matters.

Like other reviewers stated, the ordering/paying system is screwed up, but ultimately, I'm here for a delicious burger and fries! Make that a Double Big Burger with bacon and American cheese. It took a little while, but good things come to those who wait. And man, was it good. I'm ranking it at either second or third in my Best Burgers of Phoenix list. The Chuck Box grills their burgers over an open flame, giving it a great flavor.  I get people's issue with a fixin's bar, but when I was there it was in decent shape. I'm willing to forgo my slight germaphobia in order to get whatever I want, the way I want it, on my burger. Also, the midwesterner inside me loves the fact that they offer free ranch dressing for all your French fry dipping pleasure. (Please note: I'm not at all from the midwest)  I went with a friend after a day trip to Sedona for some hiking. We both heard great things and wanted to give it a try. After an impromptu decision to head directly to Chuck Box, we made a second impromptu decision to make it a Tempe burger tour and give Lobby's a try as well. Both were great, but I'm giving the nod to Chuck Box, while my friend voted for Lobby's.",

Sadly, I switched jobs so I never have the time to drive over to this area. I think after tonight I'm a have to change this habit.   After eating this burger, I realized why it was one of my favorite burger joints before they started popping all over the valley. It's absolutely terrifying delicious. It's like the best backyard bbq burger! The meat is tender and flavorful! It soaks up the burning wood for that smokey taste. Great seasoning on the burger and that round patch of bacon is awesome. I'm a fan on the way the cheddar combines with the patty on the grill.   Fries are delicious. Rings are greats. But the burger is what keeps you coming back for me. It's the key to this place. I miss Juan and the older faces because I see a bunch of young cats running the joint. Chuckbox will forever be my go-to spot when I'm being indecisive. I highly recommend this place to everyone. Remember, cash only folks!   All hail O Great Big One",

You walk up and order, wait for it to be done, pay (cash only accepted) and go to their condiments bar to add lettuce, onions, tomatoes, or whatever you like. The bar has a lot of options. Inside it is very simple, plain decor, kinda hard to breathe if you have issues with asthma or are sensitive to cooking odors. We ate outside. The stools to sit on are basically a tree stump. You dont get waited on here. This is simply a place to get an ok burger and eat. I personally didnt love it, but it wasnt bad. Just ok. Husband felt the same way. The burgers taste exactly what you get at a family bbq. Not special. Just a burger.",

I've been going here since the mid-80's when I was at ASU. Very little has changed and that's a good thing.. a very good, deep-down thing.   This uncomplicated burger experience will leave you satisfied and pining for your next trip... as it has for me over the last 40 years. The are certain foods in the valley that would be unmistakable in a blind taste test. A Chuck Box burger is one such food. The flavor of the meat, cooked over mesquite, is exceptional.   Advice:   It's a cash-only establishment, so bring some... or pay the ATM fee. I'm partial to the Great Big One with Pepper Jack on Wheat and a side of Fries. Split a pitcher with the homies.  Wash, rinse, repeat as required to sustain/improve your happiness.",

When you enter the restaurant you are greeted by a sign informing you that this is a CASH ONLY establishment.  They do have an ATM inside that charges you $4.00 to get the cash you need.  Their website does not mention that they are the only remaining cash only restaurant in the world.  As for the food, the burgers are good and juicy.  A fact that argues for a more moisture tolerant bun.  Mine got soaked and fell apart before I could finish my Great Big One.  By the way, if you order the Great Big One be prepared to let several people behind you in line to eventually go ahead  of you because their burgers will be done before yours and they don't try to hand them out in customer order (which is reasonable I suppose).  The prices are quite reasonable, although more than listed on their apparently outdated website, but their draft beer selection is limited.  Overall, I say give it a try but don't forget the CASH.",

I know its shallow but steered me clear of other spots where the \"locals\" thought was a good place but wasnt. I came here on an afternoon and was taken aback the moment I walked in. The vibe is family friendly but in a distorted way. There's lots of paraphernalia on the wall, but it also doesnt feel super homey. Almost cafeteria like. The servers are god hearted but dont necessarily seem cheery. The layout is not fancy and all of your ingredients in the condiments bar seem like a cookout. The chuckbox is no gimmick. It truly is alive, wood burning fire that sparks outside of the grill. Theres even signs alerting you of the sporadic dangers of the fire. Standing by the chuckbox feels like IM getting a sunburn because its so hot!   Nothing is wrong with what I described, but it wasnt reassuring until i ate my food. I almost wished I ordered a double juan with cheese and bacon, but a single 1/3 patty with cheese got the job done. To me, this is how Burger King should taste, The meat was moist, had a nice, even charbroil flavor, and worked well with all the other ingredients. I like that they toast the buns as well. Its also really cheap to eat here. My sandwich was under 5 dollars. Its cash only but its not that big of a deal. You could pay with quarters from your car console if you needed to.   Overall, I was highly satisfied with this traditional, no-non-sense burger. They are nothing special, but for their price, they are good.",

It's more than double many of their ages.    There are some parking spots though I've always found it easier to park elsewhere and just walk over.  The moment you walk into the restaurant, you instantly notice one long line that looks like it will take forever to order and receive your food.  The Chuck Box knows how to handle a big line.  They take orders as you stand a bit back into the line and keep the line moving along.  As you walk up, you get your drink and by that time, your food is already ready for you.  Looks can be misleading, and they certainly are in this case.    There is a very nice condiment bar that everyone seems to enjoy after you get your food and leave the line.  It's nice to personalize the burgers, chicken, fries, or whatever else of the simple menu you choose to order.  There are little ones (burgers), big ones, and then great big ones.  I've never gone hungry with a big one or a double little one.  They're all tasty no matter what you order!  It's hard to imagine that this classic restaurant has been rejected by Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  That's the story around Tempe.  Perhaps it has to do with with them only accepting cash?  Or their choice in furniture (log ends as chairs), which I personally appreciate?",

My guess is that it takes about five minutes to cook fresh. I'm a fan of the onion rings. They might be a little greasy but they are top notch just like the burger.",

You get to place your order at one end of the line and watch as your burger is cooked, put on a bun, then plated. The fries, onion rings, etc. are all cooked in front of you too- fresh for each order. This place is so simple. After you get your burger you head over to the condiment station and throw on what ever your heart desires. This place really has it figured out. I know I'm a picky eater so I get exactly what I want at this burger joint! The seating is long picnic-like tables with box stools. Perfect for this kind of place in my opinion. Quick, juicy burger for a great price.  TIP: this place is CASH ONLY! Make sure you have some before you get there.. they do have an ATM just in case.",

You then order your sides (fried zucchini, mushrooms, onion rings, fries, etc.) and pick them up on your way to pay the cashier. Be sure to bring cash - it's cash only! Once you check out, you put all your toppings on your burger in a buffet with all the fixings. You can pick your own table to dine at and sit inside or outside.   Food was pretty good although the burgers didn't have a ton of flavor to them. Service was also good and I appreciated their attention to detail. For instance, the bacon on the burgers is in a circle so that each bite gets bacon. They're also constantly refilling the toppings on the buffet. Homemade root beer was great, but no refills. They offer all the burger toppings you could think of, trash cans throughout, misters if you're sitting outside and need to stay cool, and even a free parking lot - which is pretty unheard of in downtown Tempe.   I'd return because the old western decor and concept are pretty cool. It'd be a fun place to bring a large group as long as you warn people to bring cash. And I can see kids loving this spot too.",

Anyways, I was definitely worried. Buuuuut when I got my burger and bit in, it was delicious!! It had a really nice faux meat taste, rather than that vegetable taste.

    "text": "If only the Board of Regents knew what a powerful incentive they had at their disposal in attracting students to Arizona's largest state university.  I like to say that the Chuckbox was one of the main reasons I went to ASU. Although I didn't mention it in my personal statement, the delicious smell of mesquite-grilled beef and chicken, sometimes wafting down University Drive as far as PV East, also certainly didn't discourage me from returning this year for law school. The Chuckbox has been an affordable, unhealthy indulgence for me for years. It's hard to go wrong with their sandwiches (except maybe with the veggie burger... but I've never tried it), but my favorites are the Guacamole Bacon Burger and the Tijuana Torpedo. In my opinion the fries and onion rings don't quite live up to the glory of the grilled items - I think they buy them frozen - but they're not bad either and I pretty much always order some anyway. Same goes for the fried zucchini: probably frozen, but delicious anyway with a burger.  I find the atmosphere - loud, a little smoky, definitely aptly described as a \"shack\" - perfectly complementary to the fare, but some might disagree. I've also developed a weird sort of respect for their cash-only policy... this Old-West burger joint doesn't give a damn about catering to the demands of twenty-first-century suburbanites for convenience and they don't have to (well, I guess they do have an ATM in the corner). But I can also see how many would see that as more of an inconvenience than a hip quirk.  If you're in the area, definitely stop by. In an area mostly dominated by chains and cheap, college-town blandness, the Chuckbox is a one-of-a-kind beacon.",

    "text": "It's probably obvious but this place is by no stretch healthy food so if you were looking for a healthy meal or a veg/special diet friendly place the Chop Shop next door might be a better bet.   That being said this is by far my favorite burger place (and maybe restaurant) in town. The atmosphere is awesome: cooks shouting orders and smells from the grill right in front of you. Even the hungry patrons in line are in a great mood, we always seem to make friends with the people in line. Despite the rustic feel and run down look the place is always surprisingly clean and tables are cleared right away to make room for the piles of people that come in.   Now the important part: the food. Burgers grilled right in front of you are all cooked the same way, to perfection. I highly recommend adding bacon (and cheese of course) to whatever burger you order. The fries are great and the onion rings are better. We usually get one of each and split. The burgers don't look that huge but they are very filling.   Draft root beer and beer both come with mason jar mugs and are a great bonus to this guilty pleasure meal. You haven't really experienced the best of Tempe without coming to the Chuck Box!",

    "text": "Saw this shack of a dilapidated-looking \"house\" and wondered what it was.  As I came closer, I saw what appeared to be outdoor tables with tree stumps as seating.  Went in and low and behold---a burger place.  Better yet, I could see some great looking burgers cooking on a fire grill. Even better yet, the wood fired grill uses mesquite wood!  We ordered two burgers with fries which were cooked perfectly (rare is hard to get as most restaurants are afraid to serve rare meat).  A condiments bar includes lettuce, tomato, jalapenos, pickles, sweet onions,as well as the usual toppings of mustard, ketchup, etc.  We topped our burgers and ate one of the most delicious burgers we have ever had.  The fries were perfectly fried (I asked for extra well done) and salted.  I can't tell you how great the burger was!   They are open 7 days a week which means... I will be there again soon.     BTW:  This is a CASH ONLY place.  Fine by me.",

    "text": "So, this was my first time visiting this spot after living in the neighborhood for 2.5 years. I was at a beer festival in downtown Phoenix and really wanted a hearty burger after all of that drinking and light railing it. Since, I run a huge Meetup group that prides itself on supporting local establishments throughout the Valley I decided to check out the Chuck Box to feed my beer filled, yet starving stomach.   I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger with Swiss Cheese. I am used to Swiss cheese having the wholes in it, but this one did not. I was a little nervous to eat it, but I did, and I am still a live. I am a major foodie and know when things are of great quality, etc.   Moving on, the burger was damn tasty, in fact kind of hair blowing.  The condiment bar looked a little shady, but once again, I am alive and did not get food poison. The Bacon Cheeseburger came out to be a little over $6.00 just by itself, which to me is kind of pricey for what you get.   The ambiance is not appealing on the inside, but the outdoor seating looks to be a little nicer. I am happy to have visited this spot, but will not return.  Cheers",

    "text": "Great Burgers and it's next to ASU in Tempe. This place is always a fun and a tasty treat. The outside is an old rusty brown building that reminds me of a hippie shack out in the woods. The smell of mesquite smoke and burgers hit you as you get out of your car. The inside is also very hip with a simple old timey feeling such as thick wooden crates for seats, barrels for trash cans and amusing tidbits hanging on the walls.  Easy menu to pick from with several burger or chicken options as well as sides. You can choose from Little to Big to Great BIG as far as sizes of burgers. I always get the Great BIG one which is a 1/2 pound of juicy CHUCK with the cheese of my choice and some green chilies. They cook it right before your eyes while standing in line. I also enjoy the onion rings which are beer battled and really big and tasty. The condiment bar is very large with plenty of room to stock up on all the things you would want at a family picnic and then some. Nice.  Parking is tricky being next to the campus. Bring change for the meter if you cannot get in their private lot. Also get there as early as possible to avoid the long line of HUNGRY people. CASH ONLY. Enjoy!",

You must bring cash with you to pay, but they do have a handy dandy cash machine inside in case you forget.  The onion rings are good, the burgers are delicious and the drinks are cold.   I'd also like to mention that the order of chicken strips is HUGE (5-6 full sized strips).  If you have small kids, two or three could split one order.    This is counter service, so like in the famous Soup Nazi episode of Seinfeld... just place your order and move down.

The fries were really good too and the place has that old wild west outpost feel to it.   Sadly there's only one drawback to this place: CASH ONLY.

I went here tonight because it was it's a few miles closer than my normal favorite and wasn't up for the drive. I'm glad I did. I was a bit skeptical of how my burger would turn out because I saw it being cooked, and in my foolish opinion I thought it was overcooked. Nonetheless, I made my burger up the way I like it (they have a condiment bar, as I'm sure you've read), with tomatoes, ketchup, mayo, and lettuce. When I took my first bite, I got the charred edges of the burger, but also a mouthful of delicious beef, and realized it wasn't burnt, the cook meant to do that. The patty wasn't quite as thick as I prefer, but the flavor was excellent. 5 stars, and a very close second for best burger in town.",

    "text": "I went to ASU for 4 years and only visited ChuckBox once due to my roommate dragging me along.  I remember it being packed and we ended up having to sit outside in the heat so my experience at that time wasn't the best and I never went back. However the other day I was craving a burger and decided to give it another try.  Man, I don't know what I was thinking the first time around.  The burgers are amazing!  I love the charbroiled taste!  It does take a while to get your foot because it is cooked as needed right in front of you, so the line can grow to be fairly long while people stand there and wait for their order.  They have a bar in the middle of the restaurant that has all the fixins for you to add to your burger (ketchup, mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, etc.) Some of the downsides that made me give them 4 stars instead of 5 is that there are no refills on drinks, it's cash only, and there aren't any covers for the small fixin bar (there where a couple of flies hovering around the lettuce and pickles that grossed me out). But in terms of their burgers, they are delicious!",

    "text": "While the interior appears to follow the name of what you would expect a chuck box to look like, I wasn't at all thrilled with the wait, or the product. I went with a hot dog (yes I know it's not their specialty) but really a hot dog served on a hamburger bun? That info should be disclosed before you order. Why would I want a long hot dog on a round bun? Not at all appetizing either and the fries needed salt. A popular condiment that should be cooked into the food. You wait in line to order which can take a while, pay cash only and condiments are on a salad bar type table.  Hubby had a burger which was great in flavor but unspectacular otherwise.  I think the biggest draw for this place is the location and price. It's worth going to but be careful. Hubby also almost choked on 2 toothpicks that were somehow in his sandwich. He didn't want to say anything about it so it never got mentioned but first impressions mean a lot.",

I was reminded of an old tinder pile of wood, in case you were looking for the place and could not find it. I honestly do not know how they have managed to not go up in flames yet in all of the time they have been here. They have misters outside if you want to brave the desert heat and sit on the patio.  Why would I review a place that has over 100 reviews? because then you can read a recent review instead of one from 2009. I am a vegetarian so I don't know if my review is baloney or what, but I assure you my gardenburger was the bomb. Draft beer anyone? My partner is a meat eater/carnivore and he assured me his burger was seared perfectly on the outside and very juicy on the inside. I could not for the life of me get him to shut up about the damn burger. I tried talking about musicians, porn, firearms, all to no avail!   I really like the condiment station where you can do it yourself and pile on whatever it is that you pile on your burger. I feel like I walked into old west with hammered copper top tables and wooden crate seating. You can watch your burger being grilled and it is not frozen beef but fresh chuck. The fries were good and although I did not get the onion rings, they looked excellent on other people's plates. Just make sure you sit next to the air conditioner.",

It took a while to make, but they cooked it it right in front of me.  I ordered my onion rings crispy, and the cook shouted to the fry cook. I had my drink onion rings and burger, now over to the condiment bar to get topping for the burger. My friend suggested we sit outside, as it was warm night in Tempe.   It didn't take long to chow down on a very good burger and rings.  I will be back the next time in the metropolitan area!",

We all just picked the first thing we saw just to make this guy stop asking. I would've understood (sorta...) if it was busy but there was absolutely no one in line behind us. When we got our burgers my friend and I were waiting at the cashier for our other friend to get his burger and pay (he was paying for all of ours since we didn't have cash and they accept nothing else.) The cashier asked me who was paying and I pointed behind me and said something to the effect of \"the guy waiting for his burger.\" The cashier shot back, \"There's a lot of guys behind you.\" Dude! It's not like I was trying to skip out on him or anything. I was waiting patiently at the cashiers office (again, with no one behind me) and my friend would be there as soon as his order was ready. It was a really uncomfortable experience and really, some of the worst service I've had.  The food wasn't anything extraordinary. You put your own toppings on, which were your standard toppings. The fried zucchini were pretty good. The food definitely did not make up for the employees.",

Finally I strongly believe that the main thing that makes me loce the restaurant is that they sells delicious meat and chicken .

If I want ambiance I will go to a traditional restaurant. This has been around for years so it has stood the test of time. I can't wait to go back.",
