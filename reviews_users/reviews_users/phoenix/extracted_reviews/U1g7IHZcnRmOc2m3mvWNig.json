    "text": "Shocking!!!! I am surprised at the bad Zoe reviews. Maybe it's what your ordering?   Well maybe not so shocked it is healthy food peeps! It's not slathered in something or deep fried it is fresh. For a chain I rather like Zoe's. I have a great palate and do not eat a lot of sauces and such I like to taste the food.   I enjoy the Mediterranean tuna with capers, calamata olives, and red onion. served on Zoe slaw. I am not a big fan of mayo so this oil based tuna is way better to me.   Other Yummy choices... The chicken kabobs ask for well done a little dried but brown and tasty with rice and a salad.  The tuna or chicken salads on 7 grain wheat is yummy, albeit a lttle plain I like it.  I love the spinach quesadilla and the yummy salsa with just a lil kick.  Try the chicken roll ups tasty with a lil salsa! The cake is delish!   Rock out with your chicken out Zoes I will see you tomorrow!",

Sick! (and I actually like feta... well, used to) I will not be back.  Oh, and some extremely old dood hit on me while I was waiting for my lunch. Now, while I don't exactly blame that on Miss Zoe, I am convinced that he wouldn't have been there if it weren't for all that feta.  How is there more than one of these shitholes in the valley?? Someone please explain. blech! 2 stars because my Sun Chips hadn't been tampered with... at least to my knowledge.",

So, that being said, a friend and I decided: no more chipotle, let's try that zoe's joint I always drive by.  The price: somewhat inexpensive. Not taco bell inexpensive but decent, like $7/person. The food: eh? I got the mediterranean tuna salad pita with the cole slaw for a side. The tuna was a little... unflavored. If i really wanted to have plain tuna, i would have gone to the grocery store and spent 99 cents instead of $7. The cole slaw though was actually kind of good. I've never had slaw with feta cheese in it!  So to sum up: decent prices, okay food. Will I go back? Probably, just because it's better than Arby's or McDonalds.",

I've been there 3 times so far, and each time I've gone there it was because it was close and it wasn't McDonald's (I love McDonald's don't get me wrong).  While the food is good it is definitely not a destination spot for me. I wish they had some home baked chips instead of Lay's or Sun Chips. Zoes is supposed to be healthy and I would say its not unhealthy, but I wouldn't call this health food. It would be great if it was healthy and earth friendly! Like stop using styrofoam. throw in a few cfl bulbs here and there, get rid of the Honda Elements and trade them for the Honda Insight. Imma just sayin'.",

And the thing I don't get even more than the bad reviews, are the lack of people in this restaurant.  I went back again yesterday, had a delicious meal, and there was not a sole there.  Ok, so it was at NOON!  I get the Protein Power plate.  Yes it is healthy, but it is also delicious.  The chicken and onions come on top of a plate of Zoe's slaw.  The Zoe's slaw is awesome.  A light coleslaw that has tons of Feta.  To be honest, this is all that I have had here, but when I want a healthy meal and I have already hit up Pita Jungle twice that week, there is nothing better than a little bit of Zoe's.  People support this establishment, it is realistically priced, has good quality food that is tasty and nutritious.",

Food was grocery store stuff, and the pita had genuine Oscar Meyer ham in it straight from the package.  A place that supposedly professes health stuffs stale pitas with iceberg lettuce and nitrates. Whats worse us that the person at the register acted like we were irritating her.  Like she was busy!  I really regret going and wish I stood in line at any other place in the area.  For $10, I could have bought enough stuff at Safeway to pack 5 of Zoes second rate pitas, including quality ingredients they didn't, or a great meal anywhere else.  Cheesy, bland, corner-cutting and rude.  Dont bother.",

Ya know, when you go to a restaurant and actually order grilled cheese, you might hope it would be something special... maybe with a little flair.  This didn't have it.  It looked identical to something I could have made in a frying pan at home... and it came with a bag of plain 'ol Lays potato chips.   I guess the saving grace was the side of  \"marinated slaw\".  Fresh shredded cabbage, scallions, feta cheese and a light vinagrette.  It was pretty tasty but not good enough to justify the nearly $10 I spent on the meal (with a soda).  Sadness!  I wanted this place to be some great (easy food) alternative to the Chipotle across the street .",

A variety of sandwich options and hot plate options, you'll find something to like. My faves are the egg salad and grilled chicken hot plate. I'm more in love with the rice pilaf than anything else.  The food is not extraordinary. It's just what you expect grilled chicken, greek salad and sandwiches to taste like, except if you order anything with feta, ask for it with LIGHT feta. I have to scoop off the feta when I forget.   Some say its pricey for lunch and I think its just about right. $8-$12 for lunch is about right. So if you're looking for a healthier alternative, check Zoe's out some time and swing by McDonald's for a soft-served ice cream cone at least.",

    "text": "It's all about the chicken salad...  I know that those people that reviewed Zoe's before me were not the biggest fans.  However, I think that Zoe's is a perfect place to go if you are looking for a healthy casual lunch.  Everything is made fresh daily, and it's pretty quick if you want it to be.  I go in phases with ordering different items.  My first few times at Zoe's, I had the 'protein power plate.'  For $7.45, this is a great option - especially if you're into the low carb diet!  It consists of grilled boneless skinless chicken breast served with grilled onions over a plateful of Zoe's special slaw.  Pretty tasty - if you like feta cheese.  Don't make the mistake that my friend Allyson B. made and order this if you are not a feta fan :)  My next phase was with the greek salad and grilled chicken... they give you a big portion, so it's very filling and Zoe's special dressing tops it off.  There is one surprise with this one though - Hiding underneath the salad is Zoe's special potato salad - assuming you like potato salad, you'll enjoy the surprise when you take a bite.  If not, you may need your napkin after that bite!  After the greek salad phase, I took advantage of Zoe's 'dinners for four.'  I highly recommend the chicken kabob dinner.  My boyfriend and brother did too!  For $26.95, this was a great deal - it fed the three of us and we had leftovers.  It came with eight chicken kabobs, a huge container of rice pilaf, greek salad, and pita bread.  Great for a night that you don't want to cook!  (They also have baked chicken and greek chicken marinara dinners for four available).  ... and my latest phase is the chicken salad and fruit plate.  I am addicted!  It is a light, yummy, healthy, fresh lunch and leaves me feeling just satisfied enough that I haven't had the urge to order 'Yaya's homemade chocolate sheet cake' for dessert.    So, four stars for Zoe's Kitchen... I've experienced friendly service and great food at both locations.  If you do go to Zoe's and try the chocolate cake before I do, please let me know if it's as good as it looks?!",

    "text": "Okay, so based on the owner's comment (which was very kind of her) and my co-worker's obsession with this place... I tried it again.  I ordered the Chicken Kabob entree (two skewers, rice pilaf, Greek salad, onion/peppers) with a side of hummus and pita bread. It was surprisingly better than I expected. It didn't blow me away, but definitely not a bad meal. I think I'm used to heavier spices and more flavor, which I didn't taste with their food.  I don't know if it was enough to continue ordering from Zoe's, but I wouldn't be against it either (as I was in my previous review). I definitely think everyone should give it a chance at least.",

The grilled onions and basil ratio was greater and it made a difference. Now, it's just OK. There are other good things on the menu (like the roll ups) but that sandwich used to be cravable... (I'm sure it was the basil - basil is crack to me!)  Zoe's IS a really good option if you're looking to cater a work meeting... it's healthy and different from the standard giant sub alternative.  Lame that the \"free wifi\" doesn't start until after 2. I get that they don't want people clogging the tables during a lunch rush but it's still lame...",

I loved that they served it with soft Pita, crispy pita, tomatoes, cucumbers, and green pepper. It really made the flavors of the three pop.

Walking into the shop gives more of a cookie cutter national chain feel; which is probably because they are in fact a chain of restaurants. Zoe's food was average and unimpressive. I did like the hummus though. Their prices similar to independent and family operated Mediterranean around the valley; in some cases more. I would prefer to visit Cypress Grill, just up the street from this location, they're my favorite Medi in CenPho so far.   The staff here was friendly, they took our order promptly and served the food within a few minutes. Don't get me wrong, the food was in no way \"bad\", per se. I just can't shake the feeling of \"I've had better\" when thinking about my experience.  If you're looking to fill your belly with food just because it's time to eat, this might just be the place for you. If you're interested in a great Mediterranean meal, I implore you to please try something new. I likely won't be returning, we do live in the city of a million restaurants, go out and choose one! (but don't take me at my word on that just made up fact).  Happy Yelping Phoenix, now where's my hummus?",

It took 10 minutes to get a salad, ( Around 2 pm, with maybe 5 other people in the place- already eating.) The salad also had cold wet mush potatoes under the lettuce.  The seasoning was terrible and did not go with the salad dressing at all- which was maybe why the dressing cups they gave me looked like that had not shaken the bottle up because they were all oil and no vinegar.  Also, if you are not a fan of red onions- be sure to ask for your salad without them. They started chopping them up really fine ( instead of leaving them in rings you can easily remove if needed) and the salad was at least 1/4 onions.  Really gross.",

The environment is bright and cheery, as well as the staff. I think the food is just above your average place of what you would expect from a Greek place. One of the things that sticks out and is unique is the good combinations and what their menu offers you. The prices are True to the food.

Lunch time can be a bit crazy so just beware. Everything from the hummus, pitas and salads are delicious! I don't think I would call this place \"Mediterranean\" but it's good food. The tabouli salad I ordered today was gigantic and very tasty! All my co-workers who hadn't been before have loved it after a recommendation from myself. It can get a little pricey but to me isn't price difference wise to somewhere like Paradise Bakery. The food options are really good and I like that it's a healthier choice than some of the places around the area. I also love the Greek dressing they leave on the tables (which you can buy to take home as well). All in all, I am a fan and will keep returning!",

My mother in law has us over for dinner last night, but didn't want to cook, so she placed an order with Zoe's and dinner was made!   We had a Greek salad which was HUGE! Fresh and tasty! One drawback however, they forgot to give us the salad dressing, no worries though, we whipped up our own.   Next up the rice pilaf, it was pretty good. Maybe a tad over cooked, but the flavor was good.   Lastly, the chicken kabobs! HOLY YUM! They were cooked perfectly. I don't like tomato's in the slightest, but I went ahead and tried one from the kabob and proceeded to eat 4 more tomato's, these things were insanely amazing!   Good job Zoe's, thanks for making dinner a snap! :)",

The menu said mixed greens but I got chopped iceberg lettuce, heavy on the yellow heart and watery - Note to Zoe - buy a salad spinner and skip yellow lettuce. The salad was bland and yes there is a dressing sitting on the table but it was pretty average. The feta was out in force. Yes, it's a greek salad but the scattering of cucumbers and strangely, caramelized onions.   I stuck with tea. both green and unsweetened. Again, nothing to right home about a step above Lipton but not by much. All and all, I'll pass",

Not particularly flavorful or inventive but I think you get a decent amount for your money because the sandwiches include a side (I'd go for the fresh fruit or the yummy pasta salad) and chips. I'd recommend the chicken tortilla roll-ups or the egg salad sandwich. I've been satisifed with both.   I just wanted to offer my two cents because I feel like this place gets a bit of a bad rap on Yelp from people who are seemingly disgruntled that Zoe's sandwiches or ingredients are not more \"quality\" or \"gourmet,\" but if you just adjust your expectations, you'll realize that you're actually getting quite a decent & convenient lunch for $6.75.",

Long and awkward and it's like a walk of shame to get to the bathroom if you've come in through the south entrance. The menu is also bizarre insofar as - there wasn't anything on there that I thought, \"wow, i really want to try that.\" It's been several months since I went, so I don't remember what I ended up with, but my friend and I both agreed that whatever we had for lunch was too much to pay, not really what we wanted to eat, and not really comfortable in the atmosphere in which it was presented. Styrofoam serving options bring on the guilt that is generally felt when one eats at McDonald's and throws away more garbage than one consumed.  I haven't been back to Zoe's and I don't think I'm missing much.",

Love the Grueben (grilled turkey, swiss, slaw, spicy mustard, rye) and chicken roll-ups (tortillas, feta, lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions, salsa). To me it's a great marriage of Mediterranean and American, with a little Southwestern and Mexican flair. I also really like the limeade; go for the large cup and get refills anytime you visit for 99 cents. Chocolate cake is great too. It's a little pricier than average lunches and portions are slightly smaller, but way tastier. Note that parking is way easier here; it's become very difficult at the McDowell location. Another tip - if you're on Foursquare, sign in your first time and get 10% off.",

Although I don't frequent this place, I have noticed that there isn't much variation in flavor between the menu items here; this is probably due to the fact that Zoes tends to use the same key ingredients in many of the dishes--they just rearrange them. Nevertheless, the spinach rollups are yummy!",

A heaping mound of exotic, square-cut iceberg lettuce served as pallbearer to cuts of perfectly overdone chicken.

However yesterday was not that great. The food was good (as always) but the customer service was definitely lacking. I got there really early (around 10:20 and they open at 10:00) and I was the only one. They were busy preparing some catering orders I could see however. I ordered the chicken roll ups with a side of slaw. As I was filling up my drink I noticed that she had rung up steak roll ups instead of chicken. I quickly walked over to her and interrupted her conversation with a guy who appeared to be training her in something. I told her that I hadn't ordered the steak and I wanted chicken and was it too late? She appeared aggravated and called back to the kitchen to tell them to make chicken instead of steak and then went right back to talking to the guy. No offer of refunding me the difference in price or apology or anything. Then I proceeded to wait at least 12 minutes for my food to finally come out. So I don't know if having a customer that early puts them off their game or what but I will certainly think twice before going again before their normal lunch times!",

It wasn't that entirely bad just salty. I thought Zoe Kitchen was a health alternative place, they sure used a lot of salt. I know how kabobs are supposed to be prepared, no bones and grilled. Mine wasn't grilled, I think it was probably baked in the oven with rosemary seasoning and it had a bone in it. Would have preferred grilled. Their orzo chicken soup is pretty good.",

We were charged more than the listed menu price ($0.20) for an item - when we showed the staff the difference she stared at us like we had three heads when we asked for the difference back. She said \"Ummm no, the price has just gone up\". There was NO customer service acknowledgement at all, no apology, no \"we will have them change the menus\"... nothing. Who knows how many items are mispriced and they aren't saying a word. #shameonzoeskitchen",

I ordered the steak sandwich, which had hummus spread, grilled onions, and tomatoes on it with a side of grilled veggies. I was a little disappointed at first bite because my bread was a little overly soaked in a fatty substance I'm assuming they used to grill the bread. This made my sandwich soggy and soggy makes me really sad. The sandwich itself tasted ok it seemed to be missing something to elevate the flavors and to give it a crunch. The meat also looked really sad and had no texture to it either. The grilled veggies on the side were good. They didn't seem to be seasoned at all but simply grilled. They were cooked well and no complaints there. So good job to the veggies for tasting like veggies!",

The only sandwich I get is the chicken pita and I LOVE that they slice the chicken breast down the middle lengthwise and stuff all the toppings in it. That way you don't have rebel chicken pieces escaping to your plate every time you take a bite of the pita. They certainly don't skimp on the feta and I love their Greek dressing. The chocolate cake is overhyped IMO. I have had it twice and both times it was very dry and crumbly.",

I prefer their salad dressing to Newman's, though, and that chocolate cake is a damned mouthgasm. The limeade is good too although I'm sure every sip brings me closer to diabeetus.  It's essentially fast food (what's the Greek equivalent to 'gringo'?) but I've never had a bad bite there. I ordered the protein plate in my Atkins days and now typically the Greek salad, which comes just as I like it, with absurd amounts of feta cheese. The potato salad is made with their dressing which I prefer to the standard gloppy mayo-soaked crap.",

I'm all for healthy food and would like more options when it comes to area restaurants but for me, Zoe's didn't cut it. Looking over the menu I decided upon the chicken pita. The food came quick enough, I think there was only one other patron in the place at the time. Anyways, the chicken was bland and flavorless. Hello, taste? Where are you? The pita bread was just as bad, it fell apart within moments. The only saving grace was the caramelized onions. A nice touch although not enough to save this meal. The pita came with a side of your choice (I opted for the pasta salad, pretty disappointing) and a bag of potato chips. Whatever. I thought this was supposed to be healthy eating? The decor reminded me of a fast food place in Europe: very colorful and bright. Perhaps one day in the future I may try Zoe's again, but for now two stars seems more than appropriate.",

Would have been even better if I could have had the creamy sauce but had to omit that.  It's $2 more than the chicken, but worth the premium. Only complaint is you can't get a side green salad without paying extra. Really....it's a pile of lettuce and for those of us avoiding dairy, a good option.

This place is as Mediterranean as Taco Bell is Mexican if you know what I mean.  I had the lamb gyro with a side of rice.  The pita was filled with so much purple cabbage that I ended up scraping half of it out.  There was way more cabbage than there was meat.  I've had a lot of gyros in my life and I would consider this one of the worst.  I'd rather take my chances with the street vendors in New York than try this here again.  My friend (who was with me for this visit), swears by the steak roll-ups.  Maybe I'll have to try that if I come back.  The location is good as it is situated in the shopping center on Camelback and 16th Street.  If you end up having to leave your car at one of the many dealerships on Camelback, you can walk to this place.  There are other food choices though, so you have some options.  Not sure if I'll go back to another one of these, but I'm willing to give them another shot in hopes of a better outcome.",

The amount of food that came for the amount of money was very small compared to other casual fast dining but wasn't too bothered by it. I got a small starter and a sandwich for $17.  The amount of vegetarian options was underwhelming. I usually see more than they had available at other mediterannean places. I got pesto hummus with pita bread (you need to request the bread) along with the only vegetarian sandwich they had to-go.  There was only one person in line in front of me at around 6pm and 7 other people either dining in or waiting for food. It took me 15 minutes to receive my food.  The food was good! Not absolutely amazing but good nonetheless especially considering it's a fast casual restaurant. I will definitely be giving it another shot!",

More like a gyro than an actual pita as pictured on the website.  Not sure if they gave me the wrong one or if that is how it is done here.  The flavors were pretty good.  Veggies seemed fresh.  However, the meat was a bit dry and seemed precooked a long time ago in a galaxy far far away.  Same with the kabobs.  The flavor was pretty good but the meat was dry and also tasted precooked long before I placed my order.  I like fresh food but don't call it fresh and not make it fresh.  I got a real problem with the flagrant use of the word fresh by the food industry.  We seriously need better regulation.    That aside, this place reminds me of a Pita Jungle with 7 pages less of a menu and about the same rate of food.    2-3 stars for me.  Would I come here again?  Probably not on purpose but I wouldn't refuse it if fate brought me back.",

I'm obsessed with the Mediterranean Salad Trio Bowl with either chicken or falafel (chicken was MUCH juicer but I also get that falafel tends to be on the drier side) also, today I went on their website for nutritional content and I am blown away by the low calorie and carb count and 34g of protein?! Yassss! And the price isn't bad, either. So impressed with Zoe's delicious, healthy and great prices!",

Step over those tuna sammies and order some salmon or chicken kabob plates.   This place is healthy. It's not where you go to feed your inner fatty. Or outer fatty. I can say this because I have been both in my life. I love food. If you want a sandwich, go somewhere else. If you want some lean protein and veggies that you didn't have to cook yourself, come here. And, like, maybe eat a little hummus too, so that inner fatty can get some enjoyment out of life.",

    "text": "I have been coming here for a long time and the only time I have been disappointed is with the hummus platter and small amount of pita bread they give. Aside from that, their food has been great. Tonight, we enjoyed the chicken kabobs with a greek salad and grilled potato salad. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the sauces (we tried all four selections) were all flavorful! The peppers, onions and tomatoes are a perfect addition and compliment the flavor nicely! Their greek salad may look pretty standard, but looks can be deceiving. Sure, it's all regular stuff like lettuce, onion and such, but it's the freshness that makes it really stand out, not to mention their dressing is a gift from the Greek gods! I have no clue how they have made dressing this tasty, but wow! Just WOW! Their grilled potato salad is delish! Don't let the term \"potato salad\" fool you because it is nothing like potato salad as we know it. It is moderate sized pieces of potato grilled with some onions. So yummy! I have also had their salmon kabobs and those are fantastic! I may like them even more than the chicken, which is hard to do. The salmon is always cooked just right, very tender. Mediterranean chicken is another great menu item that I have enjoyed many times, especially with their braised white beans as a side. One other thing to try is their steak roll-ups. Those are fantastic with the dipping sauce they include. Overall, I do enjoy this place quite a bit, and if they ever start offering a reasonable amount of pita bread with their hummus platter, I would up them to 5 stars!",

It was clean and the staff pleasant.  I had the veggie kabob with two sides.  The white bean side was tasty.  The fresh fruit was nice and fresh.  The veggie kabobs were meager as my friend described them.  They certainly were not undercooked and and  was so little of them that I was really amazed.  My friend had the Mediterranean Chicken.  I think she would have enjoyed them if the chicken hadn't been overcooked.  We had done quite a bit of walking and I knew were were both hungry.  For her not to finish the chicken, it must have been really overcooked.  Yes, we could have brought all this to the manager but we didn't.  After a day of looking at real estate and original art, we just wanted to leave.",

One that also comes with chip and a side dish (I opted for the fruit salad.) for a reasonable $6.95. The limeade also looked yummy, so I got that, too. While I did have to drive about 20 minutes back to my office, I still believe that this meal would have stunk even if I sat down and ate it on the spot. The bread was burnt, the cheese was American - blech! (even though I see now, I get a choice of cheese instead of all the cheese listed, I wasn't asked.), and the fruit salad was all green apples. Excuse me, one piece of pineapple. The only thing that saves this place from one star is the limeade. And even that could have been less sweet. Skip this place. It isn't healthier for you, it's not local and it under delivered. :(",

    "text": "I worked for Zoes on Camelback for a few months in 2007. But my review will be True and impartial.  I knew from the first time I ate lunch at Zoes that I wanted to work there. It was the most delicious lunch I'd ever tasted, and I wanted to eat it every day. So I did. But I only tried a few things once I found my favorite.  The chicken kabobs are usually tender and juicy. The rice pilaf can be a bit salty, so make sure to have a drink handy.  The Gruben is touted as a healthy version of the Reuben. It's not. The turky and swiss with spicy mustard and Zoes slaw on rye is full of hidden fat in the form of butter slathered all over the bread before it's grilled. It oozes sometimes.  The sandwich I keep going back to is the chicken salad sandwich. Out of the 5 days I worked, I had that sandwich at least four of those days. If you substitute Zoes slaw for the iceberg lettuce, it adds some more flavor to the sandwich.   The sides are much the same as the entrees, good overall. The pilaf, as I stated above, is overly salty more often than not. The pasta salad is my least favorite, but all of my friends love it. The slaw is delicious. My favorite is the potato salad, but it depends on the day. All of the food is made fresh that day, so it can vary from day to day. Usually it's a good, even mix. But the potato salad can be too dry, too wet, too much potato, etc. If you make it on the right day, you're in luck.   The cake makes me want to gain 500 lbs. The problem with the cake is that it's pretty much all sugar. The first time I had to help in the kitchen and make the cakes, I wanted to brush my teeth immediately. I think the mix makes something like 4 cakes, but the recipe called for about 12 cups of sugar, and the frosting is a combination of granulated and powdered sugars with cocoa. That's it. No wonder I have cavities. :\\  I don't understand what's up with all of the bad reviews. I'm not biased, trust me. I worked there when it was a franchise, and the owner was an asshole. But the food is consistently great, and the service is always quick and polite. Whenever it's my choice for lunch, I choose Zoes on Camelback.",

For $11 I got a small drink, \"pita pizza\" (which was really just a regular-sized pita topped with marinara, chicken, and feta), and a dinky salad that had no dressing.   There are better deals on the menu... One of my friends got the \"gruben\" sandwich with a bag of chips (sans drink) for a bit over $7... but she couldn't even eat the thing because it was falling apart.   As far as the space goes, it was clean and the workers were friendly enough. It was super loud, and definitely not intimate (if that's what you're going for). I'm not sure if I would go again because, in all honesty, it is a tad over-priced for what you get.",

They are really good...and they do come with sides.  But I even feel that the rice doesn't even taste the same anymore.  I will still be a regular for sure....but I am sad to see some of my fixes are gone :(",

I've Never heard of it but I knew it wasn't around when I lived down here so I decided to check it out.   Their menu seemed decent and healthier for you than most quick places.   I decided to get the tuna sandwich with fruit (see pics) I declined the bag of chips that also would have come with the meal.   Well as you can see it was nothing special and I'm not particularly fond of shredded lettuce, it belongs on tacos, but the sandwich was actually decent.  Ice cold and not overly done tuna, fresh soft bread and good fruit. They even had Caffeine Free Diet Coke at the soda fountain.   Now like others have said I could make something like this at home, but I wasn't at or near home so I didn't mind getting it here.   If I'm back in the area I would probably go back to try that chicken salad Gabi is talking about and maybe some of the chocolate cake, it looked pretty good.",

I popped in for lunch today as I was tying up some loose ends with my car dealer (Camelback Toyota--a review for another day).  I needed something quick and was in the mood for \"fresh\". Of course, I hopped on my Yelp app on my iPhone and immediatey saw Zoe's.  The menu is pretty basic. A bunch of salads, and sandwiches.   Today, I chose the Steak Rollups with a side of potato salad. The rollups were good. Not great. It seemed like something I could've made at home. The carmelized onions were a nice touch.  Something seemed a bit off with the potato salad. The ingredients and concept seemed nice. No mayo, always a plus. But, it was clearly lacking salt, or maybe even some sort of a citrus element. Perhaps, even some rosemary, but then again, I am no chef. Just a hungry man.  My food came out within a few minutes, and the service was great.  If I come back, I will try the pimento cheese sandwiches per Joel.   For a great thirst-buster, try the Hibiscus Green Tea. It's fantastic!  Bottom line, it's ok. I've had better, but 2 stars would be unfair.",

The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the girl at the counter was pretty friendly. The food however was bland and terribly unimpressive. I had the Chicken Roll-ups and they were cold, pre-made and lacking in any culinary skill what so ever.  When I ordered them I asked if i could get spinach instead of lettuce and she said they are pre-made every morning so I can't change anything... Also, They claim to be a \"healthy alternative\" and they ONLY have white flour tortillas and do not offer wheat. In my fruit salad there were 2 ROTTED grapes and when my boyfriend showed them they said \"oh, ok, sorry\" then went back to whatever they were doing...  Honestly, there are many better alternatives to go to and spend $7-$10 a plate... I do not recommend going there at all",

I love the idea of Zoe's and I think their menu is awesome but the inconsistency with this store is a shame, esp with its awesome location and high volume of customers. So why even bother writing a review? I'd love to see this location turn it around and start caring about the food quality and customer service. I feel like with Zoe's you want to get away from fast food but too often I'm disappointed with how my food looks and tastes, like it was just thrown together and sent on it's way. I mostly order online and when I get home I noticed items are missing also. Extremely frustrating.",

For a long time I used to get the spinach and chicken quesadillas, however last time I went in, I realized they didn't have them on the menu anymore. The manager that was on duty was super friendly and helpful, and explained it was now basically the spinach roll-ups (add chicken). I must say, they are even more delicious!  Is it your cheapest lunch option? Probably not. I'm a frugal person by nature, but it definitely beats eating Fast Food. So it's worth the extra buck or two to know you're not loading yourself up with tons of grease and carbs. I've introduced a lot of my coworkers to Zoe's and they all love it too. Now if only they can open up in Gilbert or Chandler near where I live!",

My two favorite Healthy Items on the menu is the Chicken Salad Fruit Plate and the Lean Turkey Pita.   The fruit is a wonderful selection of green apples, grapes, strawberries, pineapple and oranges.  Sometimes you get the melons but they don't over do it.  The homemade dressing is a perfect vinaigrette that coats the salad just enough, but doesn't make it over bearing.    Both of these items fill me up with nutrients and vitamins to help with the rest of my day, without feeling too full.  I highly recommend giving it a shot but make sure the salad dressing is included.  Sometimes they do forget it.",

I definitely respect the effort he made to remedy the situation. Very personal touch and I appreciate that. Thanks!  I've never been treated so poorly by a restaurant manager. I called in a \"to go\" order and was told to pick it up in 15 mins. My wife waited patiently in the restaurant for 35 mins and asked repeatedly when our order would be ready. She was told that a catering order came in and that our two entree order had to wait until the catering order was finished. At 40 min mark I spoke the the shift manager and told him this was unacceptable. Instead of any hint of an apology he corrected me by telling me I had only waited 34 mins. Once again I explained that this was unacceptable to which he accused me of being rude. He told me that he was going to comp my order but he was no longer b/c I was \"rude\". He told us that if we didn't like how it was being handled that we should go somewhere else which we would have except that we had already paid. It's not okay to take money from a customer then treat them with such disrespect. No respect for our time and definitely did not value us as customers. Come to find out they got our order wrong. Only had 40+ mins to get it right. Will not be back.",

They make the pita's in the worst possible style. They try to bend a double chicken breast inside a pita, forgetting to take out that strip of fat that separates the two breasts. It is when you unfold the thing you will notice the problems. Get something else or better yet, skip this place entirely. The manager on my first visit discussed and suggested the chicken with slaw pita, but the greek showed up later as I returned home. That mess was so loaded with dressing that the pita busted and that is how I discovered the weird chicken. Staff was nice enough to offer me a free pita on my next visit after I called, but although they got the order correct, this was not an appetizing item either. The rice is boring and bland as well.",

    "text": "I've sample a few dishes from Zoe's and I haven't been disappointed with anything I've had yet. The hummus is great, the salads are great, the sandwiches are great, the pitas are great, the kabobs are to DIE for and I am in love with their freshly squeeze limeade! The selection of sides here are amazing and I love how they are made as healthier alternatives to the traditional side. For example the slaw and the potato salad are made with no mayo and still manage to taste amazing.  The decor in here is lovely, it's very bright and clean looking and the manage to have a decent amount of seating for how small of a space it is. You never have to wait too long for your food which is great considering it's all made to order. It's a bit pricier then say grabbing some fast food during lunch but it's a lot healthier too and I never feel guilty or bad after eating here. They also have all their nutritional information available online which I really appreciate.   The employees here are also really friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend checking this place out if you're in the area.",

    "text": "Yum! Stopped in to grab a quick lunch with the husband. They had many healthy options. We chose the spinach wrap and a chicken dish. They have many vegan and Mediterranean foods. Clean and inviting atmosphere. One of the best things though, was the manager Marty. After we told her it was our first time there she brought over the hummus platter for us to try, on the house. She was very attentive and came over a couple times to chat and see how we were doing. She was walking around picking up trash and cleaning her store. If I were the owner, Marty would be the kind of manager I would want running my asset. Would highly recommend for a quick, healthy and yummy bite!",

I tried this place when it first opened but haven't returned because I am not particularly a fan of Greek food. So I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. =)  Perry was behind the counter when we went in and she was so friendly and helpful! She helped with some recommendations. I ended up getting a grilled chicken pasta and my boyfriend got the chicken kabobs. Both were very tasty.",

    "text": "How can I politely say that all this place has is \"chick food.\"   I have been here several times, and tried their limited vegetarian options. I found that the one with the mos flavor was the grilled feta. The feta gave it a nice flavor however the basil was lacking as were the tomatoes. It was original to use a fresh cheese like feta for a grilled cheese.  The meal includes chips and a side. I usually go for th pasta salad as it is the most filling. The flavor of the salad is bland and I usually empty half of a pepper shaker into it.   I have tried to spice up my food with the Italian dressing that is found on each table. I found it best to turn the bottle upside down and let the oil separate out, this way you can get just spices and vinegar, it goes well on the chips.   Overall the meals here are a bit pricey for the lack of flavor and portions.",
