    "text": "When I rate a restaurant, I think about what could be improved. Last night at the Market, not much. The service was great, and the food wonderful. Went with three colleagues from work after tromping around the Navajo Reservation and we were pretty dusty. The shrimp and grits appetizer was a little uninspired but quite good. I had the meat trio which was very very good but sausage was a shade less than excellent. But the chicken and beef members of the plate were terrific, the potato mash and green beans too. One other guy had the gnocchi, and the fourth had the salmon. Absolutely clean plates and happy tummies all around. Beer and wine selection top class. Too full to order dessert. Don't let the location deter you, just go and enjoy- you won't be disappointed. For me, a five star rating doesn't come easily, and this place almost made it.",

    "text": "So I was a little hesitant about coming here because I didn't see any great reviews on google and menu prices were high. We get there and it literally took over an hour to get our food. I ordered a bread board and nachos. Bread board was good which is why I gave 2 stars but the nachos...Geeze they should not be called nachos I paid $6 for a tiny bowl of potatoe chips with very gross, COLD cheese (if I could even call it cheese) I have a pic attached so you can see for yourself. I only ate like 2 chips and had my friends try too, they weren't pleased.  My friend ordered wings which tasted like plain chicken and they were suppose to be spicy. Those were also not hot. Another friend ordered steak and eggs medium and got rare. I do give props to the waitress she tried really hard to fix the situation,  but often it took her a while to even get to the table which is why I think our food took so long. would not recommend this place, overpriced and food is not good.",

All around, everyone agreed the food was top-notch.  And we sampled a wide range of offerings.  The eggs were amazingly fresh tasting, and served on top of enchiladas, as well as other dishes.  The fresh tuna on the niscoise salad was rare and delicious. Etc., etc. The service was incredibly attentive, friendly and helpful.  When my order for chilequilas was mixed up, it was corrected in just a few minutes, so I wasn't left behind to finish last.  And the server gave me a free cookie to acknowledge his mistake.  For which I felt he redeemed himself. I would recommend this jewel of restaurant without reservation (pun intended)!",

It's fresh and much of it to my understanding is locally grown. The menu is not overwhelming so what is on it has been outstanding.  They used to serve breakfast during week but sadly now it's only on weekends. They often have live music on some week nights and during brunch on Sundays.",

When we walked in, my first impression was that it was small and the tables were super close together, however, my initial trepidation was quickly put to rest when we were greeted by super server Kyle.  She was amazing!  Very knowledgeable and all-around fun.  The place was buzzing on a Saturday night, so I would definitely recommend reservations.  Super secret info - the nosh boards are broken down by meat/cheese/veggie, but they can put something together for you if you want to try some of the various elements and not just opt for a single-stream board.  And - though this may not seem like a big deal - our food was timed perfectly after our appetizer and the food was HOT.  Not heat-lamp-hot-plate hot, but hot food like it was just perfectly prepared and brought to our table.  I thought that was really impressive. I had the salmon, which was lovely and my husband had the gnocchi, which he devoured.  My only recommendation?  Dim the lights a bit once it's dark outside.  it was still fairly bright throughout our meal and a bit of ambiance might have been nice.  Otherwise, perfection.  We'll be back.",

I am always excited to see gems like this pop up, especially if they are in walking distance from my home!  I've been to The Market twice now and each visit has been lovely. The service is both kind and casual, pricing is outstanding, and the overall vibe is warm and unique. I say \"unique\", due to the space's ability to shine within Phoenix's all too familiar stripmall culture. Something that is incredibly difficult to execute out here.  Both visits I have ordered the nosh boards, which in my opinion seem to be their signature offering. I've had the charcuterie, as well as their fondue board and each is stunning in display and just delicious. The flavors of the meats and accompaniments blend perfectly, especially combined with their prosecco. Just perfect! My friend ordered the artichoke risotto and that too was amazing (not mushy or bland).   What I value the most about The Market is their knowledge in creating a complete experience for the customer. There's a certain low key flair I appreciate, from the decor to the artisan products they offer. Can't wait to visit for brunch!",

Service: very attentive and had great suggestions and recommendations which were appreciated.  Food: Everything we had was delicious and I love that they use local ingredients as it makes everything so fresh and yummy! To start we had the asparagus board which was delicious (excited to try more of their nosh boards in the future) and for our entrees I had the gnocchi which was AMAZING and will definitely order again. My fiance had the burger which I tried a bite of and it was delicious! For dessert we had the cookies and milk- so good!!! The milk is local and was incredible.   This place is a hidden gem, if you are in the Arcadia area you must give it a try! We will definitely be back for dinner and we cant wait to try brunch soon!",

We were the last table so I was already a bit cautious because no one wants that title.    The waiter Bo was remarkably cheerful and very knowledgeable.  He made some excellent suggestions and made the experience perfect.  The menu is perfectly balanced.   Nothing too complex, very appropriate mix of cuisine and flavors.   Great atmosphere and frankly underpriced for the quality.  I had the burger which was easily in top 5 all time.  I was tempted to go with the Spaghetti alla Carbonara but will order it the next time I'm there.  In an era where restaurants try to be something they're not The Market stays grounded and does everything really, really well.  Great place for a date (first or 100th), business dinner, long lunch (tip 30% if you're going to order 2 salads and 2 iced teas and stay for 3 hours).    Great job, everyone!  Keep up the great work.",

    "text": "We waited an hour for our food. The \"hot\" wings were flavorless and not hot at all; they were so disgusting they tasted like they took the wings from the fridge and dumped them in the fryer, didn't even taste like anything but chicken and oil; I didn't eat them so they were taken off my bill.   The steak and eggs were ordered medium well it came out rare and had to be sent back; they remade them and my friend ate it. (This was her 4th time at the market and said this is the 4th time of having bad service/bad food) her other experience was when the quiche was frozen in the middle.   The beer comes in an 18 oz. glass but is only poured halfway so it feels like they cheat you when you look at the glass when ordering a 12oz. beer, I ordered a bud light which was $5 I don't even want to know how much their craft beers are.    Our waitress was nice but she was overworked and running around to other guests most of the time so our table couldn't ask for anything promptly.   It's just not a place I will ever visit again, and telling friends and family not to even bother.  I have been contacted by a manager about my review and he tries blaming me about our party size and that I didn't have to pay for wings, and asked if I could change my stars because I like the band. Excuse me, your band has nothing to do with: food prepared wrong, disgusting wings, overpriced menu, and lack of good timely service.   My one star is for the band. And yelp doesn't allow zero stars.",

    "text": "Tried this for place for the first time this weekend, and had a great experience.  It's a small, casual place with a modern, mildly upscale menu (priced quite reasonably).    There were four of us, and we sampled food and drink pretty broadly.  Wine, beer, and a couple cocktails... All solid.    For starters, we tried a couple of the boards - cheese-sausage and cheese.   The cheese board was essentially what one might expect.  Sample of cheeses, apples, nuts, and olive tapenade.  The sausage-cheese board was essentially a sliced brat, cheese fondue, and some very yummy pickled vegetables.  Overall, these were just ok.  For entrees, my wife got the gniocchi and I ordered risotto.  F---. me.  Both were ridiculously good... Though I have to admit she made the better choice.  The gniocchi had perfect texture and was served in a delicious tomato based sauce with wilted greens (spinach?) and this killer roasted pork.   The risotto was was no slouch.  Al dente with duck confit, mushrooms, and truffle salt - topped, of course with some shaved parm.   Yum.  Desert was top notch as well.  Bread pudding... A la mode, of course.   Buttery, not too sweet with the all-important-for-bread-pudding perfect texture.  Service was friendly and made you feel right at home.  We'll definitely be back soon.  It's a great place to have a nice, leisurely paced meal with friends.  Good drinks.  Delicious entrees.  Great service.   No hint of snotty prentiousness that often goes with this kind of menu.",

First, let's say the service from Youlanda was OUTSTANDING! She was so sweet and down to earth, a great quality for a server. She did amazing at explaining all the items on the menu, she gave us her favorite item in each category of the menu. You could tell she really enjoyed and had a passion for the food served.   We started with the chicken tortilla soup. It had  incredible flavors! Creamy, fresh and bold!! (Oh and we got the yelp check in-free grilled wings! Yum!) We also ordered the Charcuterie board, the cheese board and the bread board and split the items. It was too much food for two people! But we really wanted to try it all!!   We enjoyed all of the meats and cheeses! I can't wait to come back and try more items! My friends ordered the yellow fin salad, which looked fresh and they had no complaints!! My friend who has been to Nice, France had the yellow fin nicoise and said it was on point :)   We also ordered the Mille Feuille. It was sweet and tart and the panna cotta.   Everything was awesome! Thank you for the wonderful service Youlanda!",

This spot is one we look forward to becoming regulars at in the coming years.  First off we were greeted by the owner and wanted to sit outside on the patio we realized its a bit crowded and on the small size so we sat inside and with the doors open you felt like you were outside.  The decor is upbeat clean and an over all great vibe. After briefly being seated our server came over Beau and took our drink order and gave us the days specials.  Needless to say I would have loved to to have ordered one of everything but I settled for a vegetarian omelet and my husband order the butternut squash breakfast enchiladas. (pictures added) The coffee was good (we are coffee snobs and drive 25mins to purchase coffee beans weekly) but the omelet was special light fluffy eggs with veggies I had not thought about putting with eggs.( roasted corn, green beans, caramelize onions, mushrooms and red peppers topped with shoe string fries).  I am a big salsa fan but no need with this omelet combo.  Let me talk about the enchiladas they are some of the best in town and would order them for dinner if they are on the dinner menu. The red sauce is definitely made fresh and very delicious. The service was top notch! Beau was very attentive, sweet and he knows the food not just the menu and he is spot on with his recommendations. Also the live music is a great added touch and they buy local ingredients.",

Mind you, the place wasn't busy but wait staff looked like they were dragging..I thought we could just seat ourselves since it looked like they didn't have a hostess..finally i grab the attention of someone working there. Asked if we could sit anywhere to which he replied \"no\" and then gave us multiple options on where to sit. He said he'd bring us menus but never did. Waited for 10mins then finally my husband asks someone if they could bring us menus. A party came in after us but they got the attention first, menus, water, etc... So we decided to walk out. One of their staff simply said \"later\"...no apologies or anything.   I guess they feel like they do not need to provide customer service to everyone..sadly we won't be back and advise the staff that they need to be consistent on how they handle their customers.",

All food is great, and they have a great wine menu also. Service can at times be a little spotty, but in my opinion, it's worth it for the quality of product and atmosphere you are receiving. It's really a hidden gem in the Arcadia area. We highly recommend making a stop in!",

    "text": "I've only heard positive things about the Chef of Jennifer's. She is a well trained chef and has worked in many very prestigious restaurants.   I came here for restaurant week and whoever prepared the food clearly wasn't Jennifer.  The best dish of the six we tried was the soup and sammich appetizer. The soup had little taste and seemed like half and half with pureed squash that was decorated nicely. The sandwich was tasty Grilled Brioche Bread that was stuffed with quality cheese, local honey and fresh pears. My husband had Arborio Rice that was still hard and not very creamy or tasty it was very flat and dry.  My second Course was Patagonia Salmon over a  Sunchoke Puree  that was getting broken up by a big puddle of oil. The Fish was topped with not so tasty combination of raw tomatoes, and brown chunks of garlic and some fresh basil. The Fish was edible.   My husband's Fresh Pasta Dish seemed like boxed spaghetti  instead of fresh pasta that was prepared mushy and seemed sort of watery.  At this point we were checked on and my husband informed the waiter about Hard Arborio Rice and Mushy Pasta. The waiter seemed sorry about that and walked away.  I was hoping that desserts would be redeeming but for me they were the worst part of the meal.  My favorite dessert is Lemon Meringue Pie so I was hoping the Mason Jar Lemon Meringue would be delicious. The Meringue wasn't Meringue but tasted like that gooey jarred Marshmallow Stuff called \"Fluff\" It was terrible to me. Nobody goes out for dinner and expects to receive  jarred \"Fluff\".My husband was hoping for an apple Tarte Tatin. You can tell by the photo he didn't receive a Tarte Tatin. I didn't taste his dessert because I was too grossed out by the Marshmallow Fluff I just had but he said the dough was really weird.   Maybe this is a really good sandwich place and not a dinner place? Maybe i hit this place on an off night and it's a possibility you might get a better prepared meal. I don't know.  This was more disappointing to me than the not so fresh sushi I had last week somewhere.  Jennifer needs to taste the food her cook prepares before it's too late.  I will not return.",

    "text": "What an adorable, curious place! Everything I'd heard about The Market is True + infinity! On the very corner of Arcadia's Gaslight Square is a hybrid dine-in restaurant with curbside catering. (If you're short on time prepared food is available for quick \"grab and go\".)  I popped in for a speed lunch with my Yelper friend Su-Shien and was *delighted* by the food, service and decor. Think fancy pants (chandeliers sprinkle the room) with rustic touches (cord is used to tie silverware). The space is intimate yet casual. Two top tables can readily be combined for larger groups.   I would love to return for dining IN the kitchen. That's right: There's a bigger table where the magic happens. Friends of mine have eaten there and raved about it. (Soon!)  The food is made for sharing. Nosh boards range from meat, veges, cheese, fondue and (get this) plain ole' bread and butter. My first experience was with the charcuterie (meat) board. The menu doesn't do justice to what is delivered. Delicate sides accompany prosciutto, sopprasata, bresola and spanish chorizo. Thinly sliced wafers of bread can be layered with violet mustard, apple chutney and pickled shallots. We made our selection while enviously eyeing the table next to us.  ....where The Very Jennifer was seated! She's a breath of fresh air! So sweet it (almost) hurts. You'll love her (and everyone else that works there).  My friend and I split the Roasted Pork Cuban Sandwich. The pork melted away, deliciously prepared and served on a brioch bun with a side of sea salt chips. Generously sized we were very happy with our portions  Happy Hour! *Every* Day They Are Open. (3-6pm) - 12 oz beers $2 - Well drinks $5 - Wine by glass 1/2 off   Love, love, love this place!",

    "text": "So it seems that the owner of this business is just as unprofessional as her employees! After my conversation with them on Wednesday, today I received a call from Jennifer and a voicemail that was largely sarcastic in tone, as well as unapologetic for her employee's behavior. Also in the voicemail was her distaste for my yelp review that she called \"harsh\". She does say \"I apologize\" at one point in a tone and verbiage that is clearly an \"I'm sorry, I'm not sorry\".  \"Hi Rae, this is Jennifer with Jennifer's catering... I would love to chat with you. I know that you chatted with Amanda yesterday and I see you had a \"very large problem with that\", so I'd like to talk to you about that. I apologize if she came across...um... harsh? But... uh, yeah... this yelp review is awfully harsh too. BUT, I think she was just going by the guidelines but, uh... obviously that was very (inaudible) to you so I'd like to discuss.\"  Jennifer ends the message by leaving her number and an extremely curt \"Thank you\".   How inappropriate can you get?!?  The only reason you have my information is because I gave it your staff member before I realized what kind of a company I was dealing with. The information was given under the pretense that I wanted to hire you to cater an event, not call and complain about my very accurate, well deserved yelp review and subsequent review update.   A tip: Don't call and leave voicemails complaining about yelp to the yelper who left it for you in the first place. How in the world do you have a successful business when you don't know the basics of customer service, hospitality and appropriate business behavior?   I'd also like to add, if you had called and were actually professional, apologetic and genuinely concerned about \"very large problem\" & the poor experience I had in the first place, instead of your yelp reviews, I would have gladly changed/amended it to say that you called and cared. Instead, you shot yourself in the foot and now this is here...   To anyone who is thinking of hiring this company, you've been warned! As for me, I've moved on and booked someone else.",

It's one thing for a place to be intimate but another to be flat out cramped.  Then they have these red metal chairs that are completely uncomfortable.  They look cool but are much more form than function.  Next, we sat right by a giant flatscreen that seems out of place where it is hung on the wall and it was even weirder that they had cartoons playing on it the whole time although I only saw one child in the place, who was not even facing said TV.    The service was really really awful.  Fumbled the drink order and then took forever to finally bring drinks, so much so that most of us decided not to order a second round even though we were there for quite a while.  Server went MIA for long stretches at a time but it was not that busy on this particular night so it was just odd.  He may have driven to BevMo because the bar was also out of stock on some things.    Appetizers and salads were just nothing special.  Had a wedge salad that was uninspired.  I get less being more but there is also less being truly less.  The main entrees I will say were good but would need to be outstanding to make up for the rest of the flaws here.    Server admitted they were not on their A game that night.  Understatement of the year.  Gave us a ten percent off card which seems more like a Denny's tactic.  I threw it away.  You'll shrug and live with sucktacular service at some places but not when you're dropping $100 for two people.  This city has way too many good restaurants for us to go back.  So we won't.   I hear their catering is awesome but maybe they are working out the kinks for a restaurant.",

    "text": "My 6 friends and I had reservations yesterday morning when they opened at 11.  We are all older and were sat at the tall table right next to the counter, the chairs were HORRIBLY uncomfortable, made of medal with a really tiny little seat, like for a 5 year old, we all kept sliding off of them because they had such a high gloss on them.  I brought it to several peoples attention and asked to be moved and was told that the other 6+ tables were all reserved, mind you we had reservations too.  The food looked like it would be really good and I guess if it had been hot it would've been but my over easy eggs were hard, the enchiladas underneath were cold, the cheese wasn't even melted.  The icing on the cake was the noise, we had a hard time hearing each other at the long, high table and then they brought in loud, live music, Oh Boy, won't be my next choice of places to go.  The flowers on our table were completely dead in cloudy water, obviously needed to be replaced yesterday.  When the waitress brought our bills, gratuity was already included, she asked me if I needed change on my $20 bill, I was like a yeah I do, I didn't get $7 service here.  Just saying, if I ever went back, it definitely wouldn't be on a Sunday morning and I would refuse to sit at that tall table.  The only good thing I can say about this place is had my eggs been cooked properly, they would've been amazing, I don't know where they get their eggs from but the yoke was amazing, what part of it that was still soft.",

    "text": "While in town visiting friends, we had a Saturday night dinner at The Market by Jennifer's after visiting the Desert Botanical Gardens. We're from the Omaha area and accustomed to some truly outstanding dining options (no, really, you should check it out). The initial impression was mixed. The interior has a warm and urban environment. However, I don't really get the idea of a big screen TV in here. It's distracting and doesn't seem to fit the experience.  We had the farmhouse cheeseboard and calamari as apps. The cheeseboard was very good with a blue cheese and a tapenade that were outstanding. But the calamari lacked even a subtle cracked black pepper seasoning. Four different entrees were selected by our table. I tried a bite of each and would have been thrilled with any of these. I chose the risotto with a side of white bean, which were both just amazingly good. Two of our group had plates with beef tenderloin. Coming from the home of Omaha Steaks, we could not have been more impressed the quality of the beef and the perfect execution. The fourth member of our party ordered the salmon plate, which I had debated getting. I'm picky about salmon, perhaps too much so. A hot, crisp exterior and a warm soft center are THE goals. It couldn't have been prepared better. The surprise was the pureed parsnips served with the salmon. Simply amazing! I'm over fifty, so my memory and hearing are less than reliable. I don't recall our server's name, but he provided the right mix of knowledge, attention and opinion. Could not have been a much better experience.",

I had friends in town for the weekend and so we decided this place would be perfect for a late Sunday lunch. I was very impressed when I walked in. They put a lot of thought and effort in creating an awesome atmosphere.  We ordered the butternut squash soup, a burger, yellow tail tuna salad, chicken schnitzel sandwich and the Cuban sandwich and shared everything. The soup and chicken sandwich was good, the tuna on the salad seemed off and we couldn't put our finger on what it was about the consistency that just seemed off, I didn't like the Cuban but everyone else said it was just OK and we all thought the burger was horrible. Everything on the burger was bland except the burnt onion. The meat had no flavor AT ALL.  I feel that there was a lot of effort put into the atmosphere and the menu was an afterthought. I doubt I will be going back.",

    "text": "We came here for lunch today specifically around a promotional dessert item they have been advertising.  The service was fairly good, a little slow at times but very nice.  We started with the Bread and Butter board, it sounded great with some of the reviewers talking about pretzel bread and jalapeno cheese bread, we had what appeared to be 3 types of bread but as far as taste went only one of them had a hint of sweetness over the other two maybe a raisin bread?  Not sure but they were a bit dry and although they tasted home made it did not taste like they were home made today, and there was no variety or distinctness to any of them. For entrees we had the Hamburger and the Cuban sandwich.  My mom didn't say anything about the Hamburger so not really sure what her thoughts were.  The Cuban is what added the third star, otherwise I would have went with 2.  Although I would classify it more as a BBQ Pork Sandwich than a Cuban.  The pork was very tender and tasty and the sauce was great the pancetta was so crisp you could mistake it for bacon (in a good way!).   We were then set to order dessert, however, unfortunately after we had ordered the waiter came out and told us they didn't have any.  If you are only serving a specific dessert for a month why would you not make sure that you have that in at all times, at least for the month.  It was extremely disappointing because there are several amazing restaurants in the area (we live 45 minutes away) and I am not able to make it out here very often.  If I had known they were not going to have what they were advertising I would have headed over to the Gladly or Citizen Public House.",

    "text": "This place has great potential,  I am going lightly and regarding it has opening weekend pains, however at least 4 front of the house employees working and only 4 people in there (my friend and I included in the 4) I expected clearer direction.  I will go back a second time to form my final opinion.  So below will be my first impression.  I walked into to who I think my be one of the owners, there is no signage to indicate that you order at a cash register and not sit down.  (I personally think they should reconsider this format)  He starts handing me menus and telling me specials and I don't even know what I am doing.  So we walked off and sat down at a table since no one told us to order at the cash register and the giant chalk board when you walk in  has a monthly calendar versus directions with arrows that say \"seat yourself\" and \"order this way\"    Anyway, we sit down and all and there is one other table in there right next to us.  I server is talking to them so we assumed that she would help us next.  After sitting there for 5 mins we finally figured out that we are suppose to order at the register.  I don't mind this format as long as it is done efficiently.  My only suggestion is that you make sure the customer knows what to do and put the deserts and some deli/cold items BEFORE the register, along with the jams over by the sitting area.     We order, get a number and sit down.  We ordered and split the Nosh (cheese board) and Cuban pork sandwich.  Both were very good and my only comment would be to include a jam or honey with the blue cheese.  However the sandwich was flavored perfectly and found it rather delightful.  It was delivered by a server and another girl who must be learning to be a server, they had a discussion on how to present and we had to sit there and wait to eat while we were used as training and the girl in training was clearly nervous and the girl instructing was say things like \"your going to have to learn\"  it was rather uncomfortable.  I would recommend writing down what you want to say to describe the food and straight read it.  But that's me.  Anyway, overall the food was good and if they improve the flow of the restaurant and front of the house service they will crush Arcadia.  I will be back in a couple weeks to give it another try and I am looking forward to trying their dinner with some slight spins on comfort food.",

    "text": "Met a friend for a late lunch today- my first visit here!  He'd already ordered a bowl of house-made potato chips and sweet potato chips.  Tried the sweet potato, and it was very good!  Crispy, not greasy-feeling (nor tasting), and lightly-salted.  Wished I'd tried the regular potato chips...  I couldn't decide on the Charcuterie board, or the Local Farmstead Cheeses, so I asked our server McCall to describe both.  Both sounded lovely, but I chose the charcuterie.  McCall was confused and placed both orders, but was quick to offer to subtract the cost of the cheese board even though friend said it was OK to leave it.  (I thought the dish looked so nice that it would be a shame to just throw it out.)  So nice of her to let us keep the selection while subtracting the cost from the bill, and what great customer service!    Charcuterie: Arcadia Premium's Lomo, duck salami, black pepper salami, and prosciutto, with garlic aioli, pickled shallots, and violet mustard. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-market-restaurant-bar-by-jennifers-phoenix?select=rNPB7fAMmaH425Y9CkBNrQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a>  Enjoyed all meats except the prosciutto, but I've only enjoyed prosciutto when crisped (it tastes too gamey to me otherwise), and this particular cut tastes just like other prosciutto I've tried at valley restaurants.  I liked the flavor and textures of the duck salami best, but enjoyed the mild saltiness and clean taste of the lomo, as well as the texture of the black pepper salami.  The garlic aioli had a very mild garlic flavor, and none of the meats really needed the enhancement.  Crostini were lightly-drizzled with butter- very nice!  Farmstead cheese board, by Lara Mulchay, local cheese monger.  Service notes listed P'tit Basque, brie, manchego, and cambozola, but I think the brie was left out and replaced by a gouda.  As pictured (from left to right), this is what I believed we received... <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-market-restaurant-bar-by-jennifers-phoenix?select=D8HIji_3H76IRSPWr1dUIA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a>  Cambozola, manchego, gouda, and P'tit Basque, with almond slivers, tapenade, and fruit compote.  My friend really liked the cheese with the blue bacteria strains (which to me looked and tasted like blue cheese, but milder than Point Reyes).  We asked McCall, who pointed to the cambozola and said it was the brie.  She was partly right, since cambozola is a mix of triple cream and gorgonzola, but this cheese was the only one on the board with a brie consistency.  Anyway, my favorites were the P'tit Basque on the farther right and the cambozola (loved the creamy texture, and I have a soft spot for gorgonzola).  All the cheeses paired well with the tapenade and my fave, the fruit compote, which today was apple in red wine (and I spotted a red pepper flake on top of one apple cube).    Btw, friend also ordered the Cubano sandwich, and I wished I'd taken a photo of it, because it didn't look like a Cubano to us.  What struck at him was the height of the sandwich, which featured bread that looked like brioche to me.  He expected it to be pressed, like a traditional Cubano.  What struck me was the BBQ'ish look of the sauce.  He took the entire sandwich home for his dinner tonight, so I'll update this review whenever I get a chance to ask him about it.  If I had to choose from the two to order again, I would get the Farmstead cheese board!  I look forward to trying out more menu items, as well as a few Jun Kombuchas.  The mango lemonade sounds delightful, as well.",

The inside dining room is small so if you definitely know you want to go, I would recommend making a reservation.   Upon arriving I walked right in and found my group already seated. It would've been nice to see a greeter at the door but various staff nodded and smiled as I located my table.  SERVICE: I believe our server may have been new as we were all pretty much first-timers and would've liked more recommendations, knowledge of the menu and ingredients. He was fairly engaging, had a \"can-do\" attitude and was very friendly so that was very appreciative. Hewill surely get better with time.  FOOD: The food was delightful but portions are somewhat sparse! Nothing particularly memorable about the food or flavors. I think it fell flat of my expectations but hopefully there's the possibility of improvement.  Overall, it was a nice experience. Not quite sure, I would return.",

I came for dinner with a friend.  The place was pretty slow since we came early on a weeknight.  We both order a couple of wines to start.  For our appetizers we shot for the Heirloom Tomatoes & Watermelon.  Great start I must say, the sweet cherry tomatoes and acidic oranges neutralized the bitter arugula while the watermelons subtle taste eased it all up!  For our entrees we ordered the Organic Chicken and the Ricotta Gnocchi.  I didn't really care for the Chicken entree, it was pounded down flat breaded and seasoned and topped with a mixed salad.  I didn't really get much out of it since I felt the Sherry Vinaigrette was too light; I wanted a stronger creamier sauce!  The Ricotta Gnocchi was the better of the 2 entrees.  The dumplings were soft and warm to the bite while the roast pork brought a wonderful surprise but welcoming protein to the meal.    Overall, I enjoyed my visit to The Market.  Our service was stellar and the place was charming.  In the end, ambiance made my night, but for me the food reminded me of a wedding dinner. - Enjoy!",

Fish tacos were crispy nuggets of joy.  Flavorful fish, hot and flaky, topped with cabbage, fresh avocado sliced, pico and light spicy ajoili.  Gnocchi was light clouds of ricotta topped with shredded pork, spinach and parmesian.  Dinner was completed with a great Napa cab sold by the glass at a reasonable price.  Wonderful meal$",

    "text": "What a charming place to grab a meal!  I came here on a Friday night with my friends.  I fully expected a wait, from reading other reviews, but to my delight there was none.  We started off with the bread and butter board ($4).  It came with a few slices of bread, including a pretzel bread, a jalapeno cheese bread, and another kind.  The breads were all great and tasted freshly baked.  The butter it came with was delicious!  If only it had been a bit softer, it would have spread so nicely on the bread.  Two of my friends shared the cheese and vegetable boards for their meals.  The veggie board came with a wide variety of veggies, with bread and chips to eat them with.  It was also served with two little cups of dressing.  The cheese board had some different cheese, also with bread and chips, and on the sides little cups of dried fruit and some type of seeds (sunflower maybe?).  They seemed to enjoy them!  Although I heard the blue cheese was a bit strong.  For my entree I got the roasted chicken.  After my first bite, I knew I loved it.  The chicken was served at a great temperature - very warm!  It was so juicy - the juiciest piece of white meat I've ever had.  My only dislike was that they sprinkled some peppercorns on top and those were REALLY strong peppercorns.  I had to pick them off bc I didn't like the taste.  Also, they included a sauce on top of the dish that was a bit too salty.  Towards the end of eating the salt became a little overwhelming.  I liked the dish a lot, but if I came again I'd probably try something else bc they had lots of interesting stuff on the menu!  tip: it's kind of hard to find, located in the back corner of a little strip mall center type place. another tip is that they sell bundles of local veggies here for $25.  so you can come every Friday and pick up a box of local veggies if you want.  another tip: they serve brunch until 5 pm on the weekends, awesome for late risers (like me)!",

As you can see from my photos it did not disappoint.  Along with the cocktail pairings that were provided too!  My favorite item would have to be, hmm, all of them!  The deconstructed hot wings, the ceviche, the slider burger and of course the cookiewich!  All amazing!  We even ordered N additional dessert off the menu which was their housemade Twix candy bar!  Yum yum yum and yom yom yom.  They also have some local items for sale from local vendors.  We bought of homeboys Jalapeno hot sauce.  You can also pick up some fresh organic chicken or duck eggs too!",

My friend ordered a Bloody Mary and the food came before the drink.  The waitress then proceeded to tell us that she had to call the owner to figure out how to make the drink.  It was loaded around the rim with too much celery salt.  It was not that good.  My friend had the huevos Rancheros, it was covered what appeared to be canned enchilada sauce and it was just ok.  I had an omelet that was very boring.  They should not even serve breakfast in there.  I did not even eat a huge part of mine and I told the waitress how disappointed I was.  I think they should have adjusted our bill.  It would be a good place to go and drink wine, they don't have to make that.  But I would not order a cocktail or any other food there.  I probably will not be back.  It is too bad, they had a great decor and I love all the little places popping up in the neighborhood.  They need to train their staff to make a Blood Mary for heavens sake or remove it from the menu.",

Tables were nicely arranged and the staff was highly efficient, despite a milling, high-density crowd through which they needed to thread themselves.  Appetizers, salad, main course (four choices) and dessert were delights to the palate.  Even though there were other tables occupied by diners unrelated to our party, the setting was such that they were not obtrusive.  The beer and wine selections were ample but not overwhelmingly large, yet selected with a keen eye.  A tiny wine bar (perhaps they served cocktails) was tucked away in the corner.  The decor was ecclectic -- a colonial style colonnaded veranda connecting through French doors to one large interior room graced by what appeared to be three Czechoslaviakian crystal chandeliers, a large-screen tv, chalk board menus on the wall, an expansive serving portal to the very large kitchen and a wall of glass-doored refrigeration units -- and yet despite this unusual collage of appliances and fixtures, the ambiance of the space was very pleasant.  We all could not have been more satisfied.  This place unquestionably is a winner.",

The meal started out with happy hour cocktails and then progressed into Prosecco and the BEST EVER scallop and citrus I have ever tasted. Then there was a green goddess salad and Pinot Grigio, with crisp thin green beans, zucchini and broccoli...so fresh! Then an amazing corn bisque and caramelized popcorn. Who knew? Salmon in a red wine with Pinot noir and later, a filet mignon and Cabernet Sauvignon. Even though I have a Type A blood type, I thoroughly enjoyed the tender meat and willingly am taking the consequences. Meanwhile live music from Korbe Canida is taking the enjoyment factor to another level (in addition to the varied lovely artwork which changes every few weeks). Dessert was white chocolate mousse and the caramelized popcorn and raspberry tart. Ok we have all agreed coming back is mandatory for brunch and dinner...great wine selection and very impressive quality of food. \"Definitely come back\" \"food was way beyond\"\"very impressive\"...\"a hidden treasure\" from attendees.

    "text": "I live very close by and was really hoping Jennifer's would be my new favorite.  Although I was sadly disappointed with the service and confused by my meal, I plan to return to try them out for breakfast.  I was sat by my waitress who came back 10-15 minutes later asking if I was ready to order, yet she hadn't given me a menu or offered me a beverage.  I ordered the herb seasoned fries (delicious! ) and the pork Cuban sandwich.  Someone else dropped off my food, and my waitress never came back. I had to flag people down as they passed to ask for things like a refill and for my tab. The \"Cuban\" resembled nothing even close to a traditional cuban sandwich.  I thought I received a bbq pork sandwich someone else ordered. It tasted mostly of vinegar (from the pickled shallots) and bbq sauce. The bun was overly charred, black and burned. They were really busy though and all new businesses experience growing pains so I will definitely be back to test out other items on their menu. There was a blond gal who I assumed was either the owner or perhaps a front of house manager that was remarkably friendly. I gave them 3 stars for now and hope to increase it after my next visit! Major plus......pet friendly patio!",

My husband and I first came across Jennifer's Catering when they catered my sister-in-law's wedding, and once my husband proposed to me and we started to delve into the planning process, I knew that I had to have Jennifer's Catering prepare the food for our wedding.  I contacted the company and from that point on was in direct communication with Andrew, who handles planning and the like.  He is so incredibly nice, and even when I kept e-mailing him with all sorts of changes and wrong numbers and made him re-do things over and over again, he always responded with unmitigated kindness that never failed to make me smile.  When my hubby and I went for our tasting, everything was out of this world -- the mac and cheese, especially.  We wanted to go for the look of gourmet comfort food --- pulled pork sliders, miniature meatloaf, bruschetta that was to-die-for and other lovely choices flocked our menu, and with every bite of something new that I tasted, \"wow\" was the word that escaped me.   We had a few guests at our wedding who are vegan or vegetarian, and Jennifer's Catering accommodated our needs with delicious food that was appropriate for those dietary needs.    I cannot say enough about Jennifer's.  They worked within our budget constraints and produced the best, most creative food that everyone enjoyed.  I recommend them with five stars -- Jennifer's Catering is truly as good as it gets.",

From the moment you walk in, I loved the industrial/rustic feel with the beautiful chandeliers that hung.. 5 of them to be exact. The place is not very big, but that only adds to the charm and cozy feeling. The staff was superb, sharing information about local fresh ingredients used and we even got to taste a special dish that one of them was photographing! The food was phenomena!! My kids are not big \"kid meal\" type kids, they enjoying eating what the adults enjoy eating and my family felt very welcomed here. Everything we ordered came in generous proportions, very fresh, incredibly delicious, and excellent ingredients... just down right fantastic. I love quaint places like this where the chef comes around to your table and talks to you, it just adds to the whole dining experience! If you are looking for something new that will excite your taste buds, come to this relaxed setting and enjoy fantastic food!",

Even though my event was modest in size and structure compared with the very large and highly patron attended examples I had witnessed, I was extremely pleased with the process of planning and execution by the staff. Keeping within my budget was a very important consideration, and I was never made to feel that this job was too small for the company. Attention to detail and the presentation of the food was outstanding, and I received many favorable comments from guests. Nevertheless, the presentation means nothing if the food doesn't deliver the same high quality, and prospective customers can be assured that this woman knows how to cook! I was delighted by the variety of food selections prepared, the kindness and extreme promptness of delivery and pick up, and I am very happy to highly recommend Jennifer's Catering.",

Neither my husband nor I, had ever been to the restaurant or used Jennifer's catering.  Strictly by reviews and restaurant write-ups for great places to dine in Phoenix, did we come upon them.  They hosted a lovely 35 person seated dinner in their restaurant for us.  We live out of state, and as you can imagine it takes a lot of communciation to get things done right for this type of occasion.  They were both gracious and helpful throughout entire process.  They even hosted a friend of ours to try some of the items for the pre-selected menu, in order to ease any concerns about not having tried their restaurant.  Very gracious.  The food was so delicious, from the roasted veggie boards, to the tender asparagus salad and amuse bouche of shrimp toasted coconut with curry sauce.  To the wondeful, salmon, petite filet and lovely dessert of banana pudding and flourless chocolate cake.  Our guests were very impressed and quite a few remarked they will comeback.  Everything was prepared just right and the wait staff did excellent job of preparing guests for how things were prepared by chef.  It was a culinary delight.  To our surprise they even had live acoustic guitar player and singer in the restaurant that night, which was bonus fo us, as we hadn't planned music for guests.  We loved it.  At the end of our evening my husband and I, were given a couple bags of goodies to take as congratulatory gift for our recent wedding.  Again I can't say enough how gracious everyone was.  I would highly recommend trying restaurant, or catering service, as they really did take care of us.  Overall we give 5 stars for food, staff, atmosphere with music and being tucked in far right corner of street, which gives restaurant their own charm.  Our best hope in hosting this dinner was to have everything taken care of to finite detail, so that we could just arrive and enjoy our guests and dinner and they far exceeded those expectations.  Thank you, The Market by Jennifers!!!",

It was supposed to be for 6 people and I easily could have fed 10. For $240.00 + tax you got everything you could possibly need and everything was fresh and delicious. Just needed to heat up the food with the directions that were included. I didn't need to clean a bunch of pots and pans, very simple. The 14 lb. turkey was moist and tasty, the gravy was very good and the cranberry sauce was excellent; wish I had the recipe! Great salad with a light balsamic vinaigrette, 3 types of fresh bread with butter, great sausage stuffing, carrots, green beans almondine, mashed potatoes and we loved the sweet potatoes. Even came with pie, we chose the pecan pie and they even included the whipped cream. Couldn't beat it for the price. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to enjoy a hassle-free Thanksgiving.",

    "text": "I've heard the \"bread and butter\" of this place is their brunch and catering ... but I have to say some of their dinner options are incredible too! Everything my husband and I tried tonight was delicious -- a burrata appetizer that was one of the best we've ever had, a ricotta gnocchi with tender pork and mushrooms that I couldn't even finish, and a pork chop that even my grill master of a husband couldn't say was overcooked or dry because it was perfectly done. The house wine (and here's where I'm the picky one!) was quite good, as was the hubby's old-fashion. The small size of the place may make it tricky at times to get a table, but that's what also gives it so much appeal and ambiance and makes it feel like \"your local neighborhood restaurant\" (and if only we lived in Arcadia, it could be!). It also sounds like the menu may change often based on seasonality and just plain changing things up (not unlike FNB in Scottsdale). Some may find it disappointing to visit a restaurant and expect the same exact menu items as before (okay, I admit I was sad to see the creme brulee wasn't orange-flavored tonight but now I'm intrigued...). It's always good to have some dishes stay the same (I mean, if it ain't broke, don't fix it), but it's nice to have more restaurants who are small enough and bold enough to make such changes to their menus daily or weekly that make you want to return to find out what's new! Looking forward to returning to find out what's new or to enjoy a brunch.",

We happened to be the only two people in the place for the first 30 minutes or so, but he was still very attentive and the rest of the staff was cleaning the place thoroughly. As someone who works in the restaurant industry, I enjoyed seeing that seeing that rather than people standing around.  Today we had the chilaquiles, steak & eggs, and the fresh cookies and milk. The chilaquiles are up there with the best I've had in Arizona. Somehow, the chips stayed crunchy the whole time and the tomatillo was fantastic. I also really enjoyed my steak and eggs. The cookies and milk were a great idea, but didn't think the cookies were special.  All in all, it was a fantastic experience and there were about 15 more items we wanted to try. We will be back soon!",

There were only 2 tables sat but it was a fairly nice crowd (6 tables...the place isn't that big) by the time we finished around 7:30pm.   FOOD: We started with a cup of posole which was much better after I asked for a side of lime. I ordered the salmon w/ mashed parsnips. It was good...the parsnips were a little too sweet for me as I typically like savory but it was tasty, nonetheless. My daughter loved the mushrooms and I did too! My daughter had the shrimp and grits which weren't your typical shrimp-n-grits like what you get on NOLA. It was poached shrimp which is fine but the dish lacked favor. I had to ask for salt, pepper and hot sauce to help it out. They serve Homeboy's hot sauce and the Verde went well with it. They should replace the green sauce that come drizzled on it with something more flavorful like that Verde sauce. The Malbec I had was delish! We skipped dessert.   SERVICE: Our server (male) was great but there was a blonde female server (asked her for limes) who was indifferent...not nasty but not friendly either.   SUMMARY: The food was good but needed some extra seasoning/flavor. However, it's a nice, low key, quaint yet kinda trendy spot in the neighborhood with seemingly healthy and fresh food so I will be back. Only 3-stars because for a tab of $57 (before tip), I shouldn't have to add to the food to make it more flavorful.",

    "text": "Have you ever tried to do an online search for restaurants where a woman is the majority owner?  Let me tell you something, it is TOUGH!  Don't get me wrong, I've dined at a number of restaurants here in the valley owned by women.  Silvana Esparza's Barrio Cafe, Carla Logan's Carly's Bistro, Tonya Saidi's Pie Hole, and the Sizemore sisters' Treehouse Bakery just to name a few.  But what I thought would be a quick and easy search for other majority women owned restaurants in the valley turned into a near frantic hours long Googlefest.  Making the process even more frustrating was seeing that many restaurants with female monikers were in fact owned by men.  Then I came upon The Market.  A restaurant I'd vaguely heard about, but had never visited before.    So on International Women's Day, I was off to visit this Arcadia area spot owned by Jennifer Russo-Fitzgerald.  Jennifer had run her own catering operation for the better part of two decades, before setting up shop here in the Gaslight Square area on the southeast corner of 36th Street and Indian School.  The Square is already a haven for foodies with restaurants like Crudo, Nook Kitchen, and Beckett's Table nearby.  The Market itself fits in quite nicely, with a space that is both aesthetically appealing and welcoming.  The interior has seating for about 60 including bar seating, high chairs and regular sit down tables.  The ceiling is adorned with chandeliers and the walls are a mix of local artwork and chalkboards full of information about the restaurant and Jennifer's still operational catering business.  The exterior has seating for about 20-30 more including a drop down high chair seating area for groups.  I came just before 5pm while things were still pretty quiet so I got a seat no problem.  First thing I did was show my Yelp Check-In which gets you a free cup of their housemade Posole Verde.  First off, this wasn't a cup.  It was a full bowl of pork, cabbage, hominy, radish, onion, cilantro, lime, and poblano peppers.  The spice level wasn't overwhelming, but certainly enough to wake up your palette and clear your nasal passages.  Great broth and tender pork.  To wash some of it down, I got one of their cocktails.  The Arcadia Sunset.  Tequila, aperol, lemon and something called strawberry peppercorn shrub.  The drink was okay, but kinda fell flat for me.  It's possible I was more focused on cooling off my tongue after that posole.  For my main entree, I was stuck between three dishes.  Before I could even utter my options, my waiter Taylor told me to get the Carbonara (which did happen to be one of my three dishes of choice).  Spaghetti with pancetta, parmigiana reggiano cheese, peas, corn, chopped tomato, cracker pepper, lemon, parsley, and a poached egg.  Wow, this hit all the right notes.  Admittedly just stirring the poached egg into the pasta was a fun distraction, but surprisingly sweet notes on the pancetta and the peas were really what set this apart for me.  Super dish and great noodles.  For dessert, I opted for the Bananas Foster Nutella Bread Pudding.  Just the title alone made me salivate.  It also doesn't hurt they're using brioche as the bread of choice.  The flower-like presentation is certainly pretty.  The mix of nutella and caramel flavors made it even prettier.  Perfect for sharing, though I had no trouble on my own.  Seriously, every bread pudding should use brioche.  Total cost for the cocktail, entree, dessert, tax and tip (sans the free posole) came to about $50.  Yeah, its not a cheap place to eat unless you're here just grazing during happy hour.  Most of the main dinner entrees here average about $20 each and the apps are around $10-$15 each so this wouldn't be an everyday stop for most.  That said, Jennifer Russo-Fitzgerald takes great pains to source all of her stuff locally which does at least partially explain the price point.  Another cheaper option is their weekend brunch which The Market is probably most known for, and when most of their main menu runs between $10-15.  All things considered, I was impressed by the creativity, the fresh flavors, the service, and ambiance.  And as I mentioned Jennifer still runs her catering operation for your corporate and social event needs.  Great dinner to cap off Women's Day and further proof that women can be successful and innovative entrepreneurs just as men can.  Let's hope the valley sees even more women owned establishments like this one in the years to come.",

    "text": "I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant! It is located in the Arcadia neighborhood, which tends to have pretty good cuisine. It's located in the back/side of a very peculiar strip mall that has an old-fashioned feel to it. The restaurant itself has a modern but rustic design. It has both indoor and outdoor seating. We came here for Sunday brunch, and there was live music to serenade us throughout our meal. We were seated on the patio by request. The weather was quite nice at this time so it was perfect. The restaurant was far enough from the main road to have minimal car noise and smell interference.   The brunch menu was pretty diverse from seafood to Hispanic-inspired dishes. They do have bottomless mimosas/blood mary/bellinis...just FYI! My friends ordered coffee, and the presentation was adorable! First, the cup of coffee itself was enormous. Then, they serve it on a dish that holds the spoon, cream, and sugar. It ends up looking like all-in-one coffee kit. I ordered the carne adovada omelette and was able to substitute with egg-whites. The meat was pretty juicy and tasty. We also ordered some desserts which were very rich and tasty.  The one downside, a very important factor, is the service. My friends and I stayed about 3 hours since there was much socializing to be done. It was busy when we arrived but slowed significantly halfway through our visit. During the whole time, our waiter was not very engaging. He was very short and was constantly walking away as he talked to us. After we paid, we stayed for probably another hour. He never came back to refill our water or check in.",

    "text": "Last time we had been here, we had a great time and great meal. Service was spot on. A group of four of us decided we'd go tonight since it had been a while and we wanted to support Chef Jennifer after her Chopped experience.   Friday night. In the mood for fun, festive and delicious. The experience could not have been opposite. As soon as we turned into the parking lot, it seemed like something was wrong, like maybe it was closed. We drove in and saw the lights were on. Four tables filled on a Friday night. We decided to walk in anyway somewhat suspicious of the lack of crowd. It was only 7 o'clock on Friday night. We were pointed to a table but not actually seated. Still skeptical of why it felt strange and deserted, we ordered drinks and appetizers. It took a long time for the first two drinks to be delivered, and the next two drinks took several more minutes. We decided to stay for dinner as now we were \"in it\" and were having a good conversation regardless of lack of atmosphere or other guests. Sadly, no one came in after us the rest of the night. The other three tables left, and we were the last people for two hours to closing. The food was average and not what we remembered. What happened or what is happening? Would love a response from Chef since it looks like there has been no response so far to other similar reviews here. We still want to support The Market, but we need a reason.  Post-review Note: Chef Jennifer did contact me personally and let me know how sorry she was that our experience did not meet previous expectations. I so appreciate her reaching out personally and letting me know that she loves her business and wants to do everything in her power to create amazing experiences for her customers each and every time. And, to be sure, September in Phoenix is a tough month in the restaurant business. We will look forward to going back to The Market soon and having a great experience. Thank you, Chef!",

We are close to the end of the year and it's 57 degrees - the perfect time to go out for brunch and sit on the patio listening to a sweet lady serenade us.   The restaurant is right next to Crudo in the back of the building! Our server was friendly and made sure a heater was next to us since it can get chilly in the shade. I first ordered the seasonal Bellini and it was refreshing! My other half and I ordered the Steak, Eggs with Fries and the Beignets.  When we got our order, they had split the steak and eggs for us which was nice! The whole plate was divine! The steak was so tender and I love the combo with fries!   We then got our Beignets and it was light, sweet  and exceptional! Our tab was close to $40 plus tip. I wouldn't hesitate coming back especially since they have Happy Hour!",

    "text": "My husband and I are huge fans of the show chopped, and of course we had to visit the market since Jennifer the owner was on there. We were so excited to come here on our date night this evening. I am going to give a very honest and straightforward review.  When you walk in, it is very confusing, as there is no hostess stand nor anyone there to greet you so we stood around for a couple minutes until we were able to scope out a waiter and ask them if we're just supposed to seat ourselves even though we made reservations.  Once we sat down, and by the way, there were only two other tables in the whole restaurant, the staff seemed very confused and disorganized. I'm not going to get into the details, but I will just say succinctly that the service here needs to seriously be re-thought.  We ordered the vegetable platter, which was outstanding. We then ordered the Caesar salad with steak which we had to return because the portion of meat was all fat and gristle. We also ordered the salmon, which was good, however I didn't care for the pearl onions, and I expected there to be roasted fennel instead of a couple sprigs of fresh fennel. I felt like the Mandarin oranges were completely disconnected from the dish and didn't belong.  Lastly, we ordered the bread pudding. This was hands-down, the best bread pudding I've ever had. I know some of the reviewers think it savory, but for myself it was perfect because I don't like things that are too sweet, so keep that in mind if you order.  The most disappointing part of the entire evening was that we actually saw the owner Jennifer and she was walking around the restaurant and we didn't see her engage with any of the tables, including ourselves, which I think is really a missed opportunity to connect with your community.  I grew up in the restaurant business and my parents and grandparents went to every single table and thanked them and asked them how the food was.  That being said, we absolutely will be back to this restaurant because the manager was so gracious at the end of our meal, and sat down with us and spoke with us about the tasting menu. Also, I would come back just for that bread pudding!",

Hard to go wrong with this salad. I also ordered the rock shrimp poboy. So good. The shrimp were cooked to about medium rare. A chewy, hard crumbly bread was the rock that held all the goodies inside and gave the sandwich more body. What was just awesome was the pickled and roasted pig trotter. Freaking awesome. It came with a light green salad with a citrus vin. So tender, juicy and fattening. But well worth it. You can also grab cold food to go pre made. Some you can heat up yourself. I went the other way and took home an awesome imperial stout. (yes, they have beer and wine to go!)

    "text": "My husband and I decided on The Market By Jennifer's for our Easter brunch spot when my in-laws were in town and it did not disappoint! After a little snafu with OpenTable, we found that our reservations had not gone through as we had thought, but they were very kind about it and still gave us a great table even though they were quite busy. The ambiance is very cute and charming, and the staff were incredibly friendly. My mother in-law & I ordered mimosas, which tasted super fresh and delicious! My husband loved the little area where he could hand pick his beer of choice, and both him and my father in-law both thought the coffee was great (an important thing for brunch to both of them.) I ordered the quiche of the day, which I was told was a green chile beef quiche and was somewhat wondering what that would be like. I was surprised when it arrived and was not at all green chile beef, but more of a veggie quiche, but it was absolutely FANTASTIC. I would HIGHLY recommend the quiche, even if you aren't generally a huge fan of them. The crust was buttery and amazing, and the \"filling\" of it was not overly eggy & truly just absolutely wonderful. My mother in-law ordered the chillaquiles and thought it was great, and my husband & his father both ordered the breakfast sandwich which they raved about. All in all, a great experience, and a place we will absolutely go back to!",

The shrimp was small and cold, the sandwich basically tasted like a salad in a stiff baguette. I was so disappointed, I wanted to cry because I was looking forward to fried shrimp in a warm baguette. For $11 I would expected something amazing.  Definitely not coming here again :(",

Signs in the charming little spot suggest local and fresh, but we asked for in-house squeezed orange juice and were told by the server that their juice comes from Costco.  We are food adventurers and don't mind paying for good bread.  Their bread board was $4.  We thought we would try it.  Horrible, no love in that bread.  The owner of this place should try Noble Bread or croissants from Essence Bakery for examples of what real and truly great bread tastes like.  We also had the posole, which was bland and tasteless in our opinion.  Staff seemed to realize that we were frustrated but we left without much in the way of resolution or happy feelings about this place.  With Matt's Big breakfast opening soon close by, Essence a short distance up the road, and gourmet places like Bink's Midtown nearby, this place simply does not hold up to the competition for breakfast in our opinion.",

Fresh burrata served on a costini with slightly roasted basil with pesto- delicious just enough salt to make it interesting.  Next up a bowl of a gorgeous pesole, just enough spice and purple onion, sliced radish and shredded cabbage to add yourself- wow by itself could be the meal topper.   Had the three meat combo- beef tenderloin, fennel sausage and roasted chicken on mashed potatoes and veggies with a red wine reduction.  This was fantastic, crispy chicken skin seasoned just right, tender beef tenderloin and wonderful fennel sausage.  This was fantastic.  Ordered the bead pudding - way to savory for my taste (nola spoiled).  Will",

    "text": "Brunch is a mess.  We, the Foodie Party of Five, we're excited to visit The Market.  There has a been a steady favorable buzz about this place for lunch/dinner but we hadn't heard much about the brunch.  There is a good reason.  The Beignets were an overly sugared version of doughnut holes that were accompanied by a strange cream cheese orange frosting that had a mildly bitter character.  Just shy of half the dough balls were burned and overall, just meh.  The Meat Frittata was a dry, very dry, assassination of the egg.  It was surprisingly dense and unfortunately under seasoned.  The Chilaquiles was the only dish executed well.  This is chili season and the batch they used today was fresh, crisp and had a nice finishing punch of heat.  The Ricotta Gnocchi was quite sparse in the ricotta department and quite average in the balance of flavor.  The White Cake French Toast was as saccharine as it sounds.  To that end, there really doesn't need to be four slices and should be paired with something salty or savory.  The Blackberry Bread Pudding was clearly made well in advance.  It did not taste fresh and, like the frittata, was super dense.  Flavor of the berries was only on the outer crust.  The bread itself was so dense that it failed to absorb the best flavors.  Service was slow and never did the waiter return to the table to check if the dishes were satisfactory.  When asked, \"what is good here?\" He only mentioned the chilaquiles...which should have been the signs to run.  The  decor is clean and inviting.  Overall, Jennifer may still be a queen of catering but she is a bust in brick and mortar brunch.",

The restaurant is small so reservations may be needed on busy nights!  With it being restaurant week, my hubby and I each got a 3 course meal. I started with the asparagus that came with a couple sauces, a quail egg and crispy prosciutto. The dish overall was ok. I wished that the asparagus had been served warm not cold, the egg was cooked well and the sauces made the plate. My husband had the thinly sliced beef served with Gorgonzola, walnuts and truffle oil. We both agreed the oil was the best part! For the main course I had the seafood gnocchi which was to die for, but had a bit too much butter/oil for me to eat any more than half the dish. My husband had the duck breast, he enjoyed the duck very much even though it was a very small portion. The bulgar wheat that it was served with was cold which was a bit off putting. We finished with the strawberry shortcake and the chocolate mousse. The mouse was SO good I ate the entire thing, and same thing with the shortcake - delicious!   After dinner my husband was still hungry due to the small portion sizes, even after 3 courses. We both agreed that the food was good but overpriced, we payed close to $100 and didn't leave 100% satisfied. We enjoyed the evening but aren't sure we will be back.",

I ordered the chilaquiles that I always compare to my mom's, and this is one of the only spots I've had some really tasty chilaquiles. When I checked in I got a FREE cup of Pozole which was a BONUS!! Honestly I would've been totally content with just the pozole because it was amazing! I wish it would've had a little more cilantro, and maybe some more lettuce, but either way it was yummy. The meat in the pozole was so tender. I loved it guys!  The server was super sweet & attentive! The reason I say this is because my husband ordered meat balls, and he really didn't like them at all. He had one bite, and was done. She offered to take it off the bill, but we told her she didn't have to do that. We paid for them, but the offer was nice. My hubby also ordered the French toast which I took a bite of, and not my fave. The consistency was like cake bread.   All in all I'll for sure be back because I had a good experience.",

Not only is Jennifer the daughter of our long-time dentist (proud papa) but I also enjoyed watching her on \"Chopped.\" The judges on the show loved her steak entree, so I wanted to order her steak and frites plate. Here were my three courses: *Cauliflower soup - This was really creamy and delicious, and I loved the addition of a toasted pretzel and fried cauliflower. *Steak and Frites - The star of my meal. The seared hanger steak was very flavorful and cooked just right. I liked the cute little container of green pepper sauce, and you can't go wrong with shoestring fries. *Pound cake - The vanilla cake was unlike other pound cake I've had. Not bad, just different. The Grand Marnier poached apricots were a nice addition, and the creme fresh was an ample portion.  My husband also enjoyed his squash and pancetta linguine. Our waiter had the serving thing down pat. He knew just when to check and in with us and never hovered. The Market is kind of tucked away behind a strip mall, but they have turned an industrial space into something appealing. Come check it out.",

Once we were in, we stood there for about a good 10 minutes before someone even asked how they could help us. There's no sign that says seat yourself or if there's a hostess.   Once we were seated, I felt that the customer service was extremely slow and it wasn't even that busy. I ordered the Carne Adovado omelet. I also ordered a cocktail. I believe it was the Lavender Collins. My omelet was super dry. I asked for salsa with it, which I'm not sure if they had any but they brought me salsa instead.My friend also had an over easy egg that came with her meal, that came out more done then over easy.   We basically saw our waiter twice. When he seated us to take our order and when he brought our check. Which took forever to get.They also had live music while we were there. It was good, however, since the restaurant is really small, it was really loud, so I couldn't hear anything my friend said to me. I probably won't be back for the bad service or mediocre food. Maybe if they were closer I'd give them another try. But for a 45 minute drive, it wasn't worth it.",

It's EXACTLY the same mix. Same texture. I know the quiche is the star, but there was not even one crackle of pepper for those bagged leaves to hide behind. It was dry as the Sonoran Desert. Like can I get a drizzle? Pretend it's a salad monsoon.   The quiche was good, though. You got that going for yourself. Still, The Market is consistently average. I'd rather cook at home, where I know how to bring out bacon's full potential.",

    "text": "Our Sunday brunch group has our favorites but we also like to pick new places to try once or twice a month. Suffice it to say that we will be adding The Market to our regular rotation.   Brunch fare here was excellent. I had the steak/frites and eggs which, although pricy at $18 was well worth the few extra dollars. The steak was full of flavor, perfectly cooked with just the right amount of sauce added, and tantalizingly tender. The sunny side up eggs came with a slight drizzle of bearnaise along with diced tomatoes, the perfect way to fancy up eggs without going overboard. The fries were deliciously seasoned and just crispy enough. This was one of the best brunch dishes I've had in a while.  My partner got the chilaquiles and said they were great. Another friend had a specialty omelette that was pleasingly presented and tasty. Two at the table for the standard bacon, eggs and toast which came with a scrumptious choice of jams.   The Market no longer does bottomless mimosas but for $15 you get a bottle and your choice of orange, grapefruit and cranberry juice. Sensing our indecision, our server brought out all three juices and we made combo mimosas--yummy! I had a sip of the white chocolate ale my partner chose and I'm thinking it would go perfect with the steak the next time we come here.   Service was friendly and attentive which of course always makes one's experience better.   Definitely recommended for brunch. It's not huge inside but we got there at 10 AM and had no trouble finding a spot for five. There is also outdoor seating when Phoenix weather permits.   May just have to try for lunch or dinner in the near future!",

    "text": "We decided to try out The Market on Valentines Day, mostly for the milk and cookies. To our surprise we showed up and they had a special 4 course menu for Vday- we saw a ton of people leave because of this, but we decided to stay. I was in no way disappointed, and I'll def be back for milk and cookies.   On the menu was a lobster and goat cheese bruschetta which was so rich and creamy and I loved it! Next course we shared a mushroom risotto (normally I don't like risotto) and it was the best think of my life, super creamy and the mushrooms were absolutely delicious, every bite melted in your mouth. Next course was tenderloins with spinach and an gratin potatoes and it was equally as amazing as everything else. We did order medium well and it was more on the medium rare side, so I ate around the edges and made the hubby eat the middle. If they'd cooked my meat properly I would rate them a 5-star most likely. The meat was so tender and mixed with the spinach and potatoes was just absolutely superb. For dessert we split a fresh berries creme brulee and flourless chocolate cake. Both were spot on, and we're glad we got both, because the cake was super dense and rich, and the brulee was light and fresh!   The service here was good. It could have been a little better considering they weren't that busy when we were there, and we had to ask for things like water refills, silverware etc more than once and it was always someone besides our waiter whom actually brought it.   I'd still go back. I'm really interested in trying food on their regular menu :)",

You can absolutely tell in the quality and flavor of their dishes.   We ordered so many items! I started with their Yelp check-in offer {duh!} for a free cup of pozole. It was good! Not the best that i've ever had, was lacking some flavor, so I probably wouldn't order it again but it was free - so no complaints! As a table, we split the green goddess salad and dungeness crab mac - holy heaven, they were both incredible! For my entree, I got the steak that came with fennel potatoes and fresh roasted veggies. The steak was SO tender and perfectly cooked. I am obsessed with fennel so the potatoes were a dream. I was in heaven!   We didn't save room for dessert but i'm sure those are fab as well. I want to come back here for lunch to see what that is like too! We'll absolutely be back soon! Thanks for an incredible meal!",

    "text": "I really wanted to like The Market, but honestly it is not worth the dollars.   Went for a Saturday evening meal as a table of four. Immediately upon entering we were seated with a wave of a hand and barely a welcome. To start we ordered a bottle of the Arizona Red Blend wine. The server said \"Arizona wine?\" so I pointed to it on the menu. The answer she gave was \"I had no idea that was from Arizona, we don't sell a lot of it\".  Keep in mind they only have about 7 red wines for sale, I am sure the owners could at least help their staff to know what they were selling.   For appetizers we go the burrata which was on a very thick untoasted piece of bread, hard to cut and in a dull pesto sauce. The whole thing had almost zero flavor. To accompany we got a board of the Noble bread which came on a massive wooden board with a sparse presentation of sliced bread which just looked so sad.    Our table then ordered two salads to split. The restaurant is nice enough to split the salads on individual plates. The salads had a great appearance but sadly the flavor did not match. The green goddess tasted like olive oil and nothing else. We purposely held off ordering our mains until a few minutes after the salad but alas the mains showed up 30 seconds after the salads. On the tiny tables this made for an awkward situation. Allow me to rant a little at this point: what is up with Arizona restaurants not understanding that there needs to be a pause between starters and mains? The job of the wait staff is to be a buffer between the clientele and the kitchen, to represent the customer and not blindly enter orders and drag out plates without timing and, as is the case with our server last night, to finally throw the food onto the table with no understanding nor explanation of what they are presenting.   We ordered a bottle of white to continue the meal and the waitress asked if we wanted fresh glasses or if she could just pour over the remnants of the red we just had. One look at the expression on my face and she suggested she should come back with fresh glasses.   For the mains I tried the Chicken kabab (dry, dull chicken breast) and the Poke (which would have been better at any of the fast food poke places in the valley).  We didn't stay for dessert. We shelled out the $160 we owed and got out of the joint.",

But it's not as cool as Beckett's. The only similarity is the lack of veg menu options. There are veg appetizers, but no entrees. All the same stuff we see on other new and old restaurant menus. I guess that's the thing to do - open a restaurant and copy other menus. Boring. And in our case disappointing. If they are going to copy we need a new upscale restaurant that copies and elaborates on Flower Child's menu.",

Let me tell you though, people need to know about The Market By Jennifer's. I'm sitting on the patio enjoying one of the better views of an AZ sunset I've ever seen, while sipping on delicious wine that is half off (during happy hour only of course), and chowing down on this amazing chips and dip plate (complimentary during HH!!). Karlene, our waitress, was extremely knowledgable and attentive. How is this place not packed?! Truly a hidden Arcadia gem. If you don't know, now you know. Get here.",

You won't find long lines here or in their parking lot. Parking is a cinch (no valet), which allows me to literally walk in and out in 5 minutes. It's one of the best attributes of The Market that I can greatly appreciate.  A hungry girl is no pretty sight so time is of value when it comes to feasting.  I'm also here every Sunday stocking up on my Evolution Juices for the week because The Market sells them at $4! That's the best price I've seen so far in the Valley, plus the girls and Richard always have a warm smile to share every time I walk in.   The restaurant has an open air feel to it, great packaging for spices and delicious pastries. I've only had one opportunity to sit down and dine, but I'd love to explore their menu more.",

He had the vegetable omelette, I had the meat quiche and we shared a side of bacon. The food was delicious, especially the bacon. The bacon had this amazing, smoky flavor to it. The quiche tasted fresh and flavorful.  The reason for the three stars is the service. I'm not sure if our server was new, but she didn't seem to know the answer to any of our questions. We asked what was in the vegetable omelette and she kind of hemmed and hawed before asking the chef, then she didn't know what the price of the special bacon was, etc. I had ordered a hot chocolate too, but that didn't come out until halfway through the meal and it was lukewarm. The other server seemed more experienced and I hope to get her next time. The food is delicious, so I'll be back again, but hopefully the newer server gets more training.",

I was excited to see that the place was packed because I want this market to be around for a long time.  The LOCATION is great.  In the complex with Antique Gatherings, Poor Little Rich Girl and Zipps, Right next to Crudo, and facing 36th Street. They've taken limited exterior space, and managed to make a great outdoor patio (that doesn't face Indian School - yay!).   INSIDE - ohemgee. Exposed ceiling, french-inspired chandeliers, and cafe tables. The devil is in the details, and they nailed it. Even the water beverage bar is on a french industrial table, while the order numbers for your table are made of solid wood with bold-font numbers. It feels provincial, trendy and local at the same time. I like a well-designed space.    The SERVICE was great.  Diners order at the counter and the food comes to you. As soon as we walked in, a server told us the process, gave us menus and told us to make ourselves comfortable at a table while we decided.  This avoids a long line at the counter.  While we sat and looked at the menu, we were served water and asked if we had questions.  (Although this is an order at the counter cafe, we never had to get up to refill our water glasses.  The servers were on top of this for us.)  And we did have a question - which of the MENU items do we try because they all sounded ridiculously good.  Traditional lunch and dinner entrees and \"nosh boards.\" We went for the Molten Fondue Nosh Board because we were on a diet (I kid, I kid.) Fresh fruit, locally-made sausage, bread and pretzel bites on a great wooden board with a small cruet of fondue. It was a prefect light lunch for two.  And it was so good that when we finished the board, I was honestly tempted to drink the few remaining drops of the fondue straight.  (Maybe they should offer this as a cocktail \"molten fondue, neat.\") We didn't have dessert or pastries, but the looked worth the splurge.  Last but not least, the \"GRAB N' GO \"  A fridge of prepared entrees that you can buy and pop in the oven at home. I was excited to see entrees in a range of palates - sophisticated choices for an adult get-together to comfort food for the kiddos. (I hear the mac n' cheese is so addictive you should warn your arteries.)  My only point of contention (every review has one) is that they are closed two days - Mondays and Tuesdays.  Deal breaker?  Nah. I'm hoping they're testing the waters and might compromise on one day for those of us hoping to pop in to grab an entree or two for dinner.  So clearly, I'm a fan. I will probably become a Norm-like regular. Cen Pho / Arcadia was crying for a place like this - casual, easy with exceptional food.  Yay. Yay. Yay.",

My friend and I ended up sharing the Cuban sandwich And also sharing their Daily Special of Posole, which is a pork based soup with hominy. These paired perfectly. The sandwich contained a hefty size of marinated grilled pork on nice slightly toasted bun. The restaurant also promotes locally sourced foods like Danzeisen Dairy. The general manager also spoke to us about the various items you can buy at the market such as fresh chicken and yes even duck eggs! He also talked about these native american beans they carry that contain a whopping 150% of your daily iron in a single 1/4 cup serving. I'll definitely be swinging by this place again for their food and the products they carry.",

I was aprehensive at first because it was nearly empty, but that changed as soon as we were dazzled by the amazing customer service from the staff.   My husband and I ordered drinks from their menu. He had a Moscow Mule, and it was tasty. I ordered an Old Fashioned, but it was a little to old fashioned for me...lol.. not throwing shade to the bartender, but I guess I really didn't know what I wanted. She recommended this amazing drink to replace the first one, I can't recall the name of it, but it had ginger beer and I believe it was a   Margarita of some kind. Bomb!! I am super obessed with that drink.   For dinner, hubby order The Market Burger, which was very nice on the eyes and his stomach. It was huge, a great value for the price of $11. I had the Pan Seared Salmon with sticky rice and boy choy with a balsamic reduction and mushrooms....it was damn good! Seasoned so well, and the fish was cooked to perfection! Sorry we didn't take pics, the food looked and smelled so good, it didn't have a chance.  I am not really much of a desert person, but I was so impressed, I ordered the brownie with rocky road ice cream and it was garnished with mint!! Woo chile, listen I ate all of it...super satisfied and I am a fan!! Will definitely be back sooner than later!",

At least, I think it's the same Jennifer. Her food was scrumptious then as it is scrumptious now. And creative. And fresh.  The location is a bit hard to find but once in, the interior is delightful.   I hope her place success because of the location and she starts to have loyal costumer and a cult following. The kind of place that spreads by word of mouth and people from the neighborhood who Become regulars there all know each other one way or another. A bit of a Friend's place.  Just by chance, when Irene V. and I were there, Jennifer herself was there giving an interview to New Times- ever friendly Yelpers we introduced ourselves and Jennifer was equally friendly to us.  We had ordered the charcuterie nosh board to share and she generously gifted us with an order of her famous roasted pork Cuban sandwich which we furiously said she didn't have to- but I mean, we're Yelpers and we love food- so once arrived, we helpfully enjoyed the sandwich, exclaiming over the robust flavor! Even without the unexpected gift, I would still write a 5 star review as like I had previously written, I loved Jennifer's food when she was strictly a caterer. Back then she had said she wanted to have a restaurant and I am happy for her her dream has come True. And I wish her many years of continued success!",

We ordered the flourless chocolate cake board.... it was so crazy good, maybe one of the best desserts I've had in Phoenix (maaaaybe). It's a delicious, dense, chocolate cake (and a large piece too!), with an espresso mascarpone topping and 3 other toppings in small containers. The toppings were raspberries macerated with mint, strawberries, and some kind of brittle. The cake with the cream and the raspberries was pure gold. I would come here just for this again. Also, the coffee was delicious and the cream came in a cute mini milk bottle (aww). The only downside was the service was a little inattentive, especially for such a small place. Anyway, I would like to come back to try their other food!",

My friend and I decided to split the cheese board, $14. They were out of the brie that comes with it, so they upped the size of the other cheese portions. The goat Humbolt Fog was my favorite. The board comes with dried fruit (similar to the kind you find in trail mix), spiced almonds (loved these) and a very interesting apricot compote (it actually tasted like sausage, but i think i liked it.)  The atmosphere is cool and comfortable. It looks like they have some great grab-and-go options as well.  I will definitely be back to try more things on the menu, but not when I'm looking for a meal under $12...",
