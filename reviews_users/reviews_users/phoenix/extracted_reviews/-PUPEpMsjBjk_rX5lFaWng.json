I must admit my Ziti & Grilled Chicken was great the first time so I couldn't make myself order anything else the second time, not disappointed!! We'll have to bring friends along so we can try other dishes, the pizza looks great!  Nice ambiance! Very cozy feeling, nice music on the weekends. Service is always great at this family run business. I would highly recommend for a dinner with friends or a romantic evening with your honey!",

Keep in mind that I have never been a fan of eggplant but the way Frank makes this meal is just the most amazing dish I have ever had. I always order this  for our special occasions and it always comes out the same Amazing!!!. Best Italian restaurant in this town. I travel from old town Scottsdale to Franks place in Chandler, yes it is far for me but it is definitely worth the trip. Best food , service. Only wish they closer to me as we would come more often. Its always a treat for us. Always recommend Pestos to our clients. Never desapointed. Thank you Frank for always making our birthdays such a special occasion for us.",

The server was mostly sarcastic from the beginning...then the salads arrived...with everything we asked to be left off, the servers excuse was that he \"asked them to rush them\", the baked ziti was awful, too much ricotta which resulted in a plate of mush ....the waiter asked if it was okay when he finally checked on us (note: after we were finished) and when we were presented with the check the server refused to take off the entree...I asked that the entree be removed which resulted with the arguing that he wouldn't do it and finally grabbed the check (along with our card) off the table and loudly stating I could speak to the owner about it.  He returned some time later with the adjusted check, no visit from the owner, no apologies, nothing.  Any indication along the way that they were attempting to make it right and we would have given it another chance, we won't be back",

I went down to Pesto's twenty minutes before the event and purchased a gift card. I then left it with Jocelyn. Jocelyn then displayed the card on the table set aside for the party. To say at the least my friends were surprised. It was perfect. Jocelyn went above and beyond to help us surprise our friend and her family. So thank you Jocelyn.

    "text": "Eating the leftover pizza now..:  Everything took entirely too long. Order wise, not kitchen time. The servers were few and far between. I can understand when it's busy, but a sidework table full of staff rolling cutlery told me they liked my \"style\" we had trouble getting service because the staff was too busy bantering amongst themselves. All of the workers were more engaged in each other than the customer. 10 mins to get a food menu, 10 mins to get a wine list, 10 mins to get a specials menu, we gave up on a beer menu? Everything took way too long and was too complicated. Too many staff members dicking around with eachother and outcasting the customer. Less workers to distract eachother, and a few that engage with customers directly would be nice. Maybe I'll stop in for lunch prices if I'm in the area, but service is not worth dinner entree pricing. We allllll know what pasta costs.  We don't need rolled folks, we need a server, hope that helps",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place since it's close to my job. Their website stated Happy Hour is from noon-6pm. I went with colleagues at 1pm and was told that the website is 3-4 mos. old and HH won't start until 2pm. I did not appreciate the False advertising/bait-and-switch, but I was hungry and so were my co-workers.    PROS: During HH, the chicken caesar salad is awesome & only $5             The olives were delicious (they're served in a bowl of olive oil-       messy, but yummy.)                 CONS: None of our water glasses were refilled for 30 minutes and I had to wave my arms to get the waiter (Tyler) to refill our water glasses.                                   The calamari is served with a weird Asian mayo rather than just simple, yummy, complimentary marinara sauce.              The pricey \"cheese plate\" consisted of small, scraped pieces of cheese that have to be scooped with a spoon to be put onto the bread.              The cocktail menu offers \"Chef's Choice.\" When we asked about it, Tyler said \"It's whatever the chef wants to make.\" So we said we'll try it, but he said the chef wasn't in and nobody else can make it.     Overall, it's too bad that this place missed out on getting repeat business from several of us who work nearby.",

We ate here for lunch, and noticed that their happy hour lasts for quite a long time, 12-6. That would definitely make someone very happy!  I decided on the spaghetti with meatballs ($13). It was a gigantic dish with one large meatball split in two, pasta, and copious amounts of red sauce. It tasted great, and the meatball was flavorful and tender. The lunch special included a salad and a drink, which meant I was definitely stuffed after eating here.  Service was friendly and drinks were refilled as needed.  I'm glad I rediscovered this restaurant. It's definitely a good option for Italian if you're in the area.",

    "text": "Decided to try a new place one Friday night. Remembered Pesto's from my High School days at Chandler High when we went there for lunch. Back then, it was a little hole in the wall and had a counter you walked up to to order. I was surprised because now the restaurant is contemporary and a sit down restaurant. The decor inside is gorgeous yet, the place is still small giving it an intimate feel. I loved the wine wall and the beading separating the bar from the actual restaurant.  Anyhoo, my husband and I opted for the appetizer sampler plate which came with stuffed mushrooms, eggplant bruschetta, and fried ravioli. The mushrooms were ok (Ive had better, Haus Murphy's has the best!), the ravioli were great but I prefer mine with meat, and the eggplant bruschetta was pretty good though different from your standard bruschetta. I could have done without the kalamata olives which I think are a bit too salty. For our meals, I got the spaghetti and meatballs with extra meatball and my husband got the meat calzone with sausage and pepperoni. I loved the spaghetti and meatballs! The meatballs were flavorful, big and meaty, and soft the way a meatball should be. I probably didn't even need to get extra because they were huge but I am glad I did since they were so yummy. I never thought I would say this but they might be as good if not better than Rigatony's meatballs. The hub said his calzone was good but it didn't seem that fresh. The cheese was not oozing from it like it would with one that just came out of the oven.  I am a total canoli connoisseur so I felt that it was my duty to try one at Pesto's. Boy am I glad I did because this was one of the best canoli's I think i have ever had! It had chocolate chips in it but what really kicked it up a notch was that it had salted pistachio's on it which gave it the sweet and salty effect. It was lovely! I probably should have gotten the mini canoli but I am kinda glad I got the big one. GO BIG OR GO HOME! Anyways, Pesto's was pretty good although the service was a little slow. I was surprised that there was no wait on a Friday night at 6 and there were still tables open. I hope this place doesn't go under cause where will I go to get a canoli fix??? WE WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK!",

This is just standard pizza, but being here it makes it seem pretty thick.  The price is reasonable.  We had two calzones and mozzarella cheese bread and were very impressed by the flavor.  The size is decent compare to other restaurants.   The dining room is very loud. If you're hearing impaired, probably not a good idea to go during peak hours.  Overall decor is meh... The staff was very attentive to our table and was fairly informative regarding menu options.  Extensive wine selection will cost you significantly more although they have a selection of some reds and whites from $12-15 a bottle.  We managed to eat for 2 with an appetizer for ~35.",

The only seating options (for the most part) were high-top tables, which seems to deter parents from bringing their loud children. This made us very happy! High points for presentation of salads and pasta dishes. They were also delicious!! The pizza did leave a bit something to be desired. The toppings were decent, but it was more the crust that wasn't very good. It reminded us of those $1 Tostino's pizzas that we bought in college. We will go back again -  we'll just stay away from the pizza and stick with the pastas and salads.",

I was pleasantly surprised to meet Antonio, a superb bartender who makes you feel as if he invited you to his house for dinner and cocktails with 40 or so of his closest friends.  He mixes a mean martini and helps you make the best drink and eat choices to fit your mood.  The lighting is right, the food fresh and tasty and the staff bring it all together for a delightful evening of socializing and or just eating.  I'm crazy for their house Pesto Pizza and  fabulous Greek Salad.  All this for a great price.  It's a jewel in the East Valley you have to check it out.",

It was so delish I could have eaten it as an entree. The wine tasting for their wine on tap was actually quite good and was only $10 for about an 8 oz combined pour.  The lasagna was ok, not the best I've had. My brother said the chicken Parmesan was delish. I would definitely go back when in the Phoenix/Chandler area",

With the addition of their new Chef comes a whole new experience you wouldn't expect from a 'pizza place'; but this is so much more. Every night they have a special menu available and prepared by the Chef himself. Having ate at all of the best restaurants in the Valley; I can tell you this Chef knows his stuff. The seafood he prepares is amazing and Debbie (The owner) always has some amazing wines available to pair perfectly with the dish. You'll find True Italian dishes and some amazing 'New American' offerings as well. The service and atmosphere are always relaxing yet, refined. If this place were in Scottsdale, I'd expect to pay 60-80 per dish; but it's not. So the prices for the quality of food you get are such an amazing deal. The staff is always willing to do whatever they can to accommodate you in anything that you want. If you're in the Chandler area, go try this place, it's well worth it!",

Then the owner came over and seemed pissed I complained about the food and then when she asked my wife why she did not want to take her calamari home she told her it was kinda bland but not to worry about it she got  even more pissed. Then the owner said \"well I brought you a cannolli I hope it is not to salty or bland for you\" and walked away. My wife and I where open mouthed, I will never return after being treated like that. If you do NOT want to hear how the food was from the customer then don't ask. I also think the owner was drinking and maybe that's why she was so mean. I run a business of my own and if I ever heard of one of my employees talking to a customer like that I would fire them on the spot.",

The first time I tried their grilled eggplant pizza all I could think was, Eggplant-- where have you been all my life? Maybe if my mother had been Italian...   Everything at Pesto's is made from scratch, from the pasta to the salad dressing. And he sophistication factor just went up with the recent addition of a wine bar.",

Giving a two star rating instead of one because the manager comped our meal after we complained.  We arrived a little after 6 on Sunday, were promptly seated then waited a bit too long to get water or hear from our waitress who wasn't very friendly and didn't seem to enjoy her job.  Then we look at the menu and I'm a bit surprised by the prices for what is described to be in the dishes.   I ended up ordering the Ziti with grilled chicken and my dad got Lasagna. We each ordered a side salad.  Sadly the best thing about the experience was the salads, which being that they were fairly plain salads with a bit too much dressing is rough.  Then we got our food. The chicken seemed like frozen chicken breast strips, and the sauce tasted like a cheap jar sauce. I also had to add salt, pepper, and Parmesan just to taste it as it was so bland. It didn't taste bad but the stoufers frozen pesto and chicken pasta is better for about $3 instead of $16  My dad said the lasagna had basic ground beef in it that tasted of the same meat quality as Taco Bell's beef mix. It also had only 3 layers of pasta. Their marinara also was pretty bland and tasted jarred.  The manager/owner came out and said he was shocked we didn't love it as these are two of the most popular items. He was defensive and said they don't salt what I ordered because they add Parmesan that has salt.  If you want overpriced bland basic Italian food with cheap tasting ingredients and lacking service then this is the place for you.",

The owners are sweet and know their customers and even connected us (through our friends who are regulars) with an amazing private wine tour in Napa.  We had the most amazing time and will never forget that experience.    The bar here is also outstanding.  I have friends that will only drink a cosmo here and their martinis are always perfect.  The wine selection is not only extensive but well vetted and fairly priced.  This is one of the few restaurants that I will not hesitate to blow through two bottles in an evening because I am always happy and don't feel like I'm getting ripped off.    If you've never been here you need to give it a try.  This is the type of owner operated place that I enjoy supporting and they always make it very rewarding to do so.",

    "text": "Pestos is my absolute favorite restaurant to introduce friends, neighbors, family and coworkers to. Each time I bring new customers in, they are blown away by the quality of food and the attentiveness of the staff.   My absolute favorite on the menu is the Shrimp Scampi pizza. The combination was something I was very unfamiliar with when I first visited, but I took the advice of my friends and tried it... and it's now a favorite that I will drive 45 minutes one way to enjoy!! Absolutely worth the taste, especially if you love shrimp!  Another item that is a recurring item on the Specials menu is the Grilled Broccoli Caesar Salad. Never have I thought it was possible to make broccoli taste like a steak... word to the wise, just order it and TRY it!!! I love to see the reaction of my guest's faces when I give them a fork of the salad for them to try it... an instant favorite.  Of the 15 plus items I have tried and sampled on the menu, I have never found for even one of them to not absolutely blow me away with the quality, presentation and flavor.  For dessert, give the salted caramel gelato a try! Paired with the dark chocolate gelato, it makes for an amazing flavor combination. It can be difficult to find room for dessert after a huge meal, but it is sooo worth it!",

    "text": "Go for the burger.  No, seriously.  Pizza at Pesto's was a tradition in my wife's family for years, but they eventually moved away from going regularly because the pizza is really very expensive - about $30 for a large specialty pie!   And this isn't a 24 inch one either.    Recently we went back for dinner, but most of us ordered pasta dishes instead.  The stuffed shells were very good, as was the mushroom ravioli.  But for me the star of the evening was their Italian Burger.  This burger is a work of art.  It is easily in the top three burgers I have ever had in my life, and it certainly is the most unique.  It is a half pound burger, cooked to order, that is served on a custom roll, along with ricotta cheese, pancetta, an onion jam, and topped with arugula.  The evening I got it it came with a side of truffle fries instead of tater tots.  You know how some things in life are so much better than the sum of their parts?  This burger is one of those things.   It can be described to you, but until you experience it you really don't get it.  Pesto's should be entering this in Valley wide burger competitions - it really is that good.    I originally felt like a bit of a rube ordering a burger when I went to an Italian restaurant, but when it was served any reservations I had quickly evaporated.",

The atmosphere is very nice.  A touch of class to it.  The menu was a simple over-sized heavy paper.  Lots of interesting dishes listed.  The waiter recommended a few, and we ended up going with two of his suggestions.  First was the ziti and chicken.  It came in a white sauce with pesto.  (A lot of their dishes have pesto, which may be why they named the restaurant \"Pesto's\"!)  It was very tasty, and the portion was quite reasonable.  Something different from a lot of Italian restaurants (and vastly better than most of the chains like Olive Garden).  The other dish was their Italian burger.  It was BIG.  And surprisingly good.  Very nice seasoning and toppings.  Not an ordinary burger!  Our waiter was two for two.  We had a very nice anniversary lunch.  I think it safe to say we'll be coming back.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants something different than typical Italian fare (though they did have a lasagna I was tempted to try...maybe next time!).",

Decided to get the sampler which was well worth it. So delicious. After I had the clam pasta and husband had the pizza. Do yourself a favor and have the clam. It's fantastic! So traditional in the wine broth. It had a little spice to it but not enough to really call hot. It was a nice warm, subtle heat that only adds to the enjoyment. Husband loved the pizza. He's not a man of many words so I have no idea as to the chewiness of the crust or anything else but I'll say this, it looked like a good pizza. Not weighed down.  After we were finishing, we found out that our waiter was the owners son. It was lovely talking with him about his parents place and how the whole family is involved. Just gave the place an extra bump to know the love that goes into the food they create and serve.  Big thumbs up for me.",

I tried the Italian burger because I like unique entrees and our waiter Noah recommended it. It was simply one of the best burgers I've had in my life with a bit of sweetness (house made onion/balsamic/cane sugar jam), pancetta and a crisp, hearty house made bun. I was almost sad to finish it, it was so good!   Noah was a friendly, attentive and relaxed server. He asked what brought us into the restaurant, answered my questions about menu items thoroughly, and made a point to provide more than the bare minimum of service, something I don't experience often. Having worked for three years in an Italian restaurant as a server myself, I cannot overstate how valuable such service is in generating returning and satisfied customers!   So if you are looking for a locally owned and relaxed Italian restaurant with great staff and fresh food (and fantastic Italian espresso made skillfully on an authentic machine), I suggest Pesto's!",

I have seen them grow and develop over the years into a great spot to bring the family for good food and also be a great place to mingle with friends or even the other regulars. If you came from somewhere else and left your friends and family back home, stop by Pesto's and make new friends. Frank & Debbie are continually re-inventing their menu to keep it fresh and exciting. Frank, Debie, and Roxane treat everyone as if they were long time friends. Many thanks to you and your family for making me and my family feel welcomed.  Davide",

My only complaint was the lack of break basket and dipping oil. If I have a bread basket I'm more prone to sit there and drink more wine. Overall we would absolutely return as the overall experience was great!! #butgetsomebreadbaskets",

I rounded my review up to 4 stars because of the alcohol selection. The bar has an impressive selection of both liquors and liqueurs that you don't often see at a typical bar. It is nice to see businesses making drinks other than standard margaritas and vodka/crans. Every single specialty drink I have ever ordered from here was smooth and tasty. They also have a pretty decent Scotch selection which is fairly priced as well.   Furthermore, the pizza is good although pricey... the white pizza is delicious and the basil really stands out on it. The standard cheese pizza that you can order by the slice really lacks any kind of wow factor though. If you order pizza from here, you should definitely order a whole pizza and ditch the by the slice option completely.   Overall very cool place. I'd recommend going on a Saturday night when they have live music.",

Because our party was so big and we had so many different orders and I had my fork in each plate. The cracked crab pizza.....TO DIE FOR! The chicken pesto penne ....uh, AMAZING....Sambuco Chili wings were finger licking good! Lamb burger was grrrreat!. Happy hour was delicious!",

This time was the deal breaker and unfortunately we won't be back. It seems like a cute little place to have.   My husband and I got specials of the night.  I had meat he had pasta. The meat was weird. Weird meaning it reminded me of a piece of water logged meat. It was cooked how I ordered it medium rare but it was weird and I didn't like the flavor. His pasta was seafood based and they ran out of some of the seafood. He said it was bland and the shrimp were hard (over cooked).   It's a bummer that it was a bomb.  The service was pretty terrible too.  That was the final decision.   Oh well.... Disappointed. I was so hungry and now my appetite is ruined for the night. Lame.",

It was late (10 pm) and I was out with the kids all day and then had some errands to finish and I realized I had not eaten all day. I did not want fast food so I pulled into Pesto's and walked in with fingers crossed. First impression, the atmosphere is exactly what you expect when you walk into an Italian restaurant and the smell.... I immediately wanted to order one of everything. As soon as I confirmed they were still serving dinner, I snagged a seat at the bar and Katie was there with a menu and a smile. I quickly ordered a glass of Siduri (delicious, if you like Pinot Nior), a side Caesar and the baked ravioli. The water came with cucumber instead of lemon, refreshing twist, and the salad was great... I was so excited for the entree! It did not disappoint! The ravioli was amazing but what really set it over the top was the marinara! I don't know what they do so differently but it was some of the best I have ever had! I want to buy it in the costco size, and never use another  my entire meal with the wine was $32 and I have enough food left over for tomorrow's lunch - except I won't be eating it for lunch because I got home, put on my pajamas and finished the rest while writing this review. It's just as amazing 45 minutes later. I can honestly say this is the best Italian I have had in Arizona. Not only will I be back, I'm bringing friends. Date night, girls night, or late night dinner alone, pick Pesto's. You will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "Pesto's, it is a pleasure to write a review for this \"Neighborhood bar/restaurant\" from my experiences over the last several months during my short stay in Chandler, AZ this year. My boyfriend and I have really enjoyed and appreciated having such a quintessential neighborhood bar restaurant located 5 minutes from our house. What makes Pesto's so amazing is not only the great bar, Happy Hour and local feel, but it's amazingly delicious, quality food!   This is a family owned business and the proprietors are quite pleasant and actually work and run the restaurant daily. I think this is part of the secret to the success of Pesto's. Their $5, 2pm-6pm Happy Hour is delicious and a great bargain for the food. I have enjoyed many tasty pizzas, salads, and cheese platters at Pesto's. The portions are generous and the vibe is very cool and laid back with nice low lighting. From the outside the looks of Pesto's is very deceiving, but once inside a quaint bar atmosphere is experienced with lots of locals frequenting the place.  My personal favorites are: the Malbec on tap, $5 Happy Hour bubbly, fresh pesto served with crostini, and the cheese platters. My friends have also enjoyed there freshly baked Tiramisu and swear by it. Anyway, thanks Pesto's for providing a cool, friendly, and yummy place in the neighborhood! I highly recommend this to anyone in the local area and it won't let you down when you have family/friends in town, as they will also undoubtedly fall in love with it!",

    "text": "A co-worker recommended trying Pesto's, so I went by myself one day for a late lunch and then took my entire family one night for dinner. But, I don't think we'll be back. The service for dinner was good; the younger server was really trying his best and raved about how everything on the menu was amazing. It was terrible.  Our appetizer was decent. The kids meals were average, nothing special.  The eggplant rollatini tasted reheated and the ricotta was sour. The chicken parm also tasted reheated and you could tell the chicken was \"off\". I mean they were so bad that we couldn't even take more than a couple bites before giving up, not because it was bland, but because it was poor quality and stale.   So at this point I'd say this place is an average 3 star.   But we told our waiter that the 2 dishes were really bad and we didn't like the reheated food. He came back and said \"I spoke with the kitchen, and they said that everything they cook is fresh\". I was in disbelief. He offered no substitute or discount and promptly gave us our bill. At this point, it's 2 star. I feel dumb for giving them my money and I will never consider returning.  This is where it gets good. So I went on the Maricopa County website to search for their food inspection ratings. Guess what I found?  On 6/25/18, they had a few violations including \"Observed cooked eggplant in walk-in with date mark of 6/17. Both items have date marks from over 7 days ago and PIC confirmed items were prepped the days that the date marks indicate. PIC discarded items when brought to attention.\"  Cooked fresh my a**!!! Now we are at a 1-star.  They also had violations for other items on this day, such as the mozzarella cheese, pre-cooked pasta, spinach, and diced tomatoes. What good Italian restaurant uses pre-cooked pasta?  On 2/20/18, they had violations for frozen meatballs, sausage, lasagna, and more. Again, frozen!  On 9/6/17, they had a violation for frozen baked wings in ziploc bags with condensation. Again, frozen!  I feel like you'd see this place on Kitchen Nightmares. Serving frozen food at those prices, no thanks.  Get your act together and don't lie to your customers.",

This was a recommendation from a couple of friends and I also want to add my little stamp of approval. They must have had a shift change during my meal because I had a different bartender for the last 20-30 min and service was still top-notch.

We ordered calamari, bacon wrapped dates, Cesar salad, Greek salad, lasagna, and linguine with clam sauce. The calamari was well seasoned and the dipping sauce was also flavorful and really good. I didn't try the dates but others said it was a delicious combination with the dates and bacon and bleu cheese. The Greek salad is what I had and it was really good! Very fresh and colorful. The lasagna was good as usual and the linguine was good too. There was a good amount of clams in it but we didn't know it was going to be like a noodle soup like dish. Flavors we're all good and overall experience was good.",

So yes this review comes from the bowels of my hear...well no, just my bowels. You made them very unhappy.

The ambiance and lighting were perfect, and the space created a very relaxed, modern vibe, which was not at all what I was expecting from the outside. It's in a strip mall in a Fry's lot and looks from the outside like an average mom and pop pizza joint, but it's totally chic and cool inside!!    My husband and I are pretty picky about our italian food and we liked everything that we ordered. I especially liked the eggplant parmesan sub I had, it was one of the best I've ever had.   The wine flights are really great, you can choose 4 of your own picks or go with one of their themes. The pours are generous, you get what equals at least 2 full glasses when you order a flight.   We will definitely be going back!",

We had a party of four. We were seated right away. Drink orders taken quickly. They serve water with cucumber in it to clean your palate for wine. However, we didn't have wine. One in our party sampled a wine but she was tempted by the 1944 Mai Tai cocktail which we all tasted and it was spectacular. Fun cocktail names too! I can't believe they've been in business 19 years. I moved to Chandler 17 years ago only two miles away from this restaurant and I've never been to Pesto's all this time. Shame on me. However, I will definitely be back and bring friends and family. Would like to try the happy hour for some more delish cocktails and some more of the specialty pizza flavors.",

Who knew such a cute wine/pizza/pasta place was inside?  The decor is gorgeous - and I loved the beaded curtain and high top tables!    As for food - I had the BEST Calzone (the Pesto) I've ever had!  It wasn't too cheesy and the sauce on top was perfect.  We also loved Pesto's take on the caprese, with greens added.  There were lots of options for wine too.    The hubby tried the pepperoni pizza and said it was \"okay\", but he's picky when it comes to pizza.  Granted, we did go early but there were too many kids for my liking.  If you're looking for a more \"adult\" environment, I'd suggest sitting in the bar area.  As we were leaving, they were setting up some live music.  We'll definitely be back!!",

My first and really only qualm is that they sat us at a table for 8 (there were only two of us) and then sat another group of 4 at the other end of the table... I didn't really like this and it kinda cut down on the privacy of the date... I would have gladly waited 10 minutes for another table.   The waiter was really attentive and suggested good things.   We both ordered two different white wines suggested by the waiter and they both turned out very nicely.  We got the garlic pesto bread with mozzarella which we both really liked.   I got the stuffed spinach shells and he got the chicken calzon. Both were very good, the spinach was strong so I would only suggest for those who really like spinach. The portions were a good size not but too big so it would be easy to finish your plate and a small appetizer if your not super hungry.   I'll come back for sure and try some other dishes. :)",

As lovely as the wine list is, what truly is the cherry on this sweet slice are the bartenders. They are not shy about a generous pour, love a long chat about absolutely nothing and know absolutely everything about the wine they serve and love to share. What is not to like about this establishment....well, the food is just okay. Hey, its' Chandler. Wadda ya want? The pizza crust has  improved recently and well, the appetizers have never been anything to right home about.

I admit, I wish restaurants had sections for families so that those who do not like watching kids run around or spitting food out of their mouths on to the table could eat in peace, but that is just me and that is why I have dogs and not children.

It's located in a strip-mall but don't let the exterior fool you. It has great ambience - especially in the bar area.  This is the only place where I actually crave a salad. I get the chicken caesar every time. It's more like a vinaigrette, which I love. Can't stand salads that are drowning in dressing - especially if it's thick. If I'm really hungry, I'll also get a slice of pizza because it's just too good! Then I usually get full after the salad and save the pizza for lunch the next day.   If I am in the mood for a hot meal, my go-to is the ziti with grilled chicken. It's a favorite among my family and friends, so everyone usually steals at least one bite. The sauce is creamy and flavorful, not bland like many other alfredo sauces tend to be. The addition of pesto is a tasty touch!   The family that runs it is wonderful too! They make everyone feel like they're your neighbors, as cheesy as that sounds :)",

We arrived around 2:30 on a Saturday, the bar area was beautiful, with just a few customers before the Sat rush comes in to listen to the Jazz band.

    "text": "This place, in my opinion, is a bit overrated. I think part of the reason is because of it's location in Chandler, where there isn't much else.  On a positive note, yes the decor is nice, with a laid back feel. As for the food, we chose a calzone that was smothered in marinara and the \"Pasta Greek.\" The calzone was really good but the pasta dish was lacking flavor. The chicken in it was overcooked and tasteless and the one thing that stood out the most were the kalamata olives, which were delicious. And for the price of the pasta, I would've thought the portion was gonna be larger. Just saying.....this place serves Italian right? Then where's my leftovers? Derrr.  I really wanted to try their pizza but I couldn't justify $16 for a 10\" pizza when I've had what I KNOW to be awesome pizzas for less at places like Bianco and Cibo.  Overall, a pretty decent experience, mostly I'm sure because of the company, but I probably won't go back just because of location and because I think they're trying too hard but don't quite deliver.",

    "text": "I don't get out to Chandler much. But a friend's bridal shower ended up being held here. From the food to the service, everything could not have gone smoother. I heard they had recently remodeled the place. Well...bravo! Everything is tastefully decorated. Looks like a great place to get your happy hour on. There was a beaded curtain that sort of separates the bar area from the dining area. But it's a metallic bead curtain so not at all hippie-like. I can't believe a place like this is inside a strip mall with a Safeway.  The theme of the shower was wine and cocktails. The bartender--the owner's daughter--was super hospitable and personable. For our party, she demonstrated how to make four different cocktails. And the owner even went to the trouble of printing out the cocktail recipes on specially decorated paper. The owner is a lovely woman with a lovely personality. The owner is actually good friend's with the bride's mom. So, I don't know if the restaurant would do that for any party. But judging by how nice she was, I'm sure they would do something if asked and offered reasonable payment. And everyone was raving about the cocktails which were truly very good. My favorite was a chocolate martini. The bartender was skilled at taste as well as presentation.   For the food, we had a yummy cheese plate which included a parmesan cheese with honey for dipping, a truffle flavored cheese and another cheese that came with a pesto dip. We also had some scrumptious stuffed mushrooms. And for pizza, we went with the pesto and Mediterranean (sun dried tomatoes, chicken and feta cheese). The pizzas were thin crust and piping hot. And the cheese in my opinion was melted to the right consistency. It took all my power not to shove down more pieces when not everybody had gotten some yet.   I was happy with the food and level of service. I would definitely recommend to anyone. I only wished I lived closer so I could visit Pesto's on a week day.",

This time my cousin was in town and she loves pasta and because the portions here are so big and filling. We skipped lunch and had an early dinner here before my cousin's 9pm flight. So we made the trek from downtown Phoenix to Pesto's.   We ordered our choice plates and they come out and everything was great until I saw my plate had sausage and I ordered the ziti with chicken. No substitutes made as that's how it's written on the menu.   I let the guy at the bar know and he apologizes but now I'm a bit annoyed as 1)I'm hangry 2) its now 5:38pm and my food is being sent back. I arrived at 5:10pm. 3) Another 15 mins go by and my dish isn't out.   So now at 5:53pm my food is finally being bagged up as we have to go to make the trek back to Phoenix to get my cousin's things and then to the airport and I STILL haven't been able to eat.   The guy at the bar said \"well it's a human error, sorry.\" Well it doesn't matter. We even said why we were here eating specifically and my food is wrong. So thanks I got to watch my cousin eat. So much for enjoying a meal TOGETHER.   He said he wouldn't charge me for our dinner. Well it's not about the $$$ it's about the SERVICE and EXPERIENCE. My food comes out and we get ready to go and he calls after me when I leave \"you're welcome\" I turn back around said \"not really. It's your fault why I'm going home hungry\".   I would NOT recommend this place to anyone which is a shame as the food is great... if they get your order right. Plus they're disrespectful and petty. Not the kind of people I want to give my money to.",

We didn't have a reservation but got lucky with a table in the bar area. I would say it may be best to make a reso if you're planning on going over the weekend. The staff were all really great and you could tell that they had a great appreciation for their customers. The restaurant has a very apparent vibe of many customers being \"regulars\" but they were still so welcoming. The food and wine selection was also top notch! They have wine flights - which was the major selling point for me! We had the trio platter for an appetizer and it was delicious. We also had the chicken parmigiana and the spinach stuffed shells. The pasta sauce was what stood out to me the most... you could tell it was made with love and perfected by someone who knows Italian food well. We will definitely be going back to dine again!",

You know, the place has to have that italian smell and you feel right at home? Yep, this is it. The ambiance and decor changed a bit since I went a while ago, and it was updated and modern, intimate and casual all at once. The bar is always full of regulars and I love that. It's like Cheers! However, I am not one of their regulars (yet). I always get chicken parm, yum and the bread is to die for. The wine and drink selections are always on point. I love that they added an outdoor section and can seat more people. Thanks Pesto's for being such a good neighborhood place.",

The chicken filets were lovingly wrapped in fresh basil and prosciutto and the sauce was loaded with mushrooms. The portion size is perfect for sharing or a second meal from the leftovers. I am going back as soon as possible to try more dishes. Very impressed on my first visit to this lovely place and can't wait to go back.",

The service was friendly, only small complaint: drinks were slow, but not a deal breaker. I live in the neighborhood behind this shopping center and would love to have a wine night and walk home :)",

    "text": "Pesto's is yet another highly rated yelp enigma for me.  Dropped in to pick up some food to go and enjoy a beer while I waited.  The place was mobbed, but I found a spot at the bar, ordered a beer, and was served promptly.  After looking through the menu, I noticed they had some specials that looked interesting and were culinarily adventurous; however, I decided to go with standard fare: A cheese pizza and an order of lasagna, as regardless of the wizardry they employ with their specials, any Italian spot with 4/5 stars should knock these dishes out of the park. This is where things went downhill.  The pizza was lackluster at best.  It was just clunky: too much sauce, too much cheese, crust was underwhelming in taste and texture.  It seemed like a pizza I would get from a sports bar or some other place where it's a second thought.  The lasagna was equally disappointing.  The portion size was large, but besides that it ranked 1 meh on the taste scale. The tomato sauce was run of the mill...  not terrible, but definitely not forgetaboutit.  The lasagne itself is out of the box pasta, which is acceptable, but at $17, I was maybe expecting something more.  The ricotta was just bland and had a Stouffer's vibe to it. The worst part was the meat. It tasted like plain ground beef that was just dropped into a pan and browned.  No herbs/spice, little to no seasoning, zero finesse... This sunk the lasagna ship upon first bite. The sum total tasted like some store bought frozen stuff... very disappointing, and definitely not indicative of \"family recipes go back 100 years to Italy\".  Bottom line is, if an Italian place botches pizza and lasagna on this level, I'm out.  I would be willing to bet almost any hole in the wall Italian/Pizza joint has better pizza and lasagna(if they offer it).  I liked that they had some inspired specials, but if this place can't prove itself on fundamental dishes, why risk trying their loftier ones?",

    "text": "One of my favorite cuisines is Italian.  I've enjoyed incredible Italian food throughout the US and Europe.  While pulling out of Fry's recently, I noticed Pesto's and we decided to give it a try after checking out the Yelp reviews.  On the outside, it looks like a somewhat tired pizza place, but brace yourself... on the inside, it is sleek, modern and inviting.  We enjoyed the happy hour offerings.  We had the ziti with marinara, the charcuterie board, a mushroom pizza and the sambuca honey wings.  The marinara sauce was very fresh and made with quality ingredients you could taste.  The mushroom pizza - the dough was a perfect level of chewy meets crispy. I'm  a NY pizza lover and the taste and texture were definitely reminiscent of a high quality NY pie - yum! The wings were a little sticky, a little exotic and a lot delicious - yes, please.  The charcuterie board had various quality sliced meats with succulent grapes and toasted bread - pretty much what you would expect, EXCEPT... it came with a house made garlicky pesto, a tangy fig jam and a perfectly balanced tomato jam.  Just those condiments alone were worth the price of admission!  Generous pours of our sparkling wine and merlot made everything that much better.  To top off the meal, we had a cannoli and a cappuccino.  The cappuccino was properly made and the cannoli almost made me cry, it was so good!  When you bite into it, the crispy shell cracks, allowing the velvety lemon-kissed mascarpone to grace your tastebuds.  One of the freshest, simplest and very best cannolis on the planet :)  The food was outstanding - we will be returning very soon.  Thank you for a wonderful end to our weekend Pesto's!   PS. the management and wait staff were very attentive and truly cared about our first experience there.",

    "text": "Wow! WOW! I don't know where to start to we will just go through all I can remember and start from the beginning. Let me make you aware of two things first. One- I am really picky. Two- I know food. We walk in and are the first customers of the day. I expect slight errors knowing it takes a bit to get into the groove. We were promptly greeted and sat where we chose. There were four of us, two adults and two pre teens. We ordered drinks and browsed the menu. Our server was knowledgeable enough to even ask if my hubs and daughter wanted lemon or lime for their Pellegrino. We ordered the wings, very skeptically, wings at Italian and we just don't do sweet unless it is desert. Wrong assumption number one for us. We also got calamari. I knew the thicker slices would be rubber because it's the cut. I do not like remoulade-ever. Wrong two and three. The calamari, even the thickest pieces were tender and oh so good. The breading was more a batter it seemed which had an amazing crispy outside that didn't get soggy and made for moist bites instead of dryer pieces that if had in other places. I figured I'd give the sauce a try because I've been wrong twice already. So wrong number 3. The consistency and flavor were spot on. The spice level was just enough where you tasted it but it didn't make it to where you didn't singe taste buds. Our meal choices we made to share because we couldn't decide and are as follows: eggplant rollatini, pesto pasta with shrimp, lamb burger, spinach and garlic calzone and shrimp and marinara. Eggplant- crispy and not mush with the perfect amount of sauce. The eggplant was not cooked to flavorless like most places but in fact was very flavorful. Pesto pasta- my girl really wants to like pesto(think it's the teen drama/must be cool thing) and we've spent a lot of money different places and she always hated it until today. I heard numerous times how she expected to hate it and it's 'so not like so and so last blah blah' so that's a great bonus for me(less money wasted). The flavor was not overwhelming at any point like some places too much garlic, etc. the calzone was holy cow good. Not a soggy part of bread anywhere and browned to perfect. The spinach was fresh, not canned like I've seen too much. The cheese was made in a way that made it not gritty like a lot of ricotta but creamy and cheesy like you really want. The shrimp marinara was exceptional in flavors and textures.. I didn't eat a lot so I can't say much more. Lastly- the lamb burger. I mentioned we don't do sweet unless it's desert. Wrong again!! I cannot RAVE enough about this burger. My son and I couldn't stop. The temp was spot on, shocking to me honestly, had so many bad experiences lately I really was shocked. The meat was soo juicy and tasted like an actual burger. The aioli was out of this world. The combination doesn't work in my brain but I jokingly told my kids I would trade them for another burger to take home. I'm dead serious when I tell you it is absolutely one of the five best things I have ever put in my mouth in my 43 years! Don't pass it by. Getting long winded but here are the deserts. Chocolate cherry mousse, tiramisu, dark chocolate gelato, caramel gelato, coconut gelato and pistachio gelato and I got an espresso. Don't like the texture of mousse nor the flavor usually, but this was oddly pleasing. The tiramisu had the fluffiness and creaminess I expect and there didn't seem to have shortcuts like many I have had. The gelato flavors were so crisp and defined that you could eat little bits for hours and enjoy them. I also must point out a few things that we noticed. When you go into a nicer place, we tend to overlook the simpler things that aren't as good as we like because the unique is exceptional enough to make it okay. For example, you get a veal parm from a place, of the pasta isn't cooked but meh status but the veal is out of this world it makes the pasta bearable but not stand out. At Pesto's, everything we touched and tasted was spot on. The pastas were cooked to perfection, the dressing on the salad was just enough but not too much, the garlic bread was crispy where it should be and warm goodness where you expect it. I don't think my words will ever do justice to this establishment, the server we had and the chef. You must go and taste for yourself. PS.. to our server.. I didn't compliment you enough in this, but you were great. My hubs bday was yesterday and I had to cancel our reservation due to a chaos of events and a bad day from start to end. You helped me so much to try and make up for it and I do appreciate you very much. You didn't hover, let us enjoy our meals and our time. You were there when we needed anything but let us just breathe and have a great time. Thank you again.",

Bottom line: Great atmosphere, great wines, great appetizers, great desserts, so-so salads and friendly service (even though they forgot one of the sides we ordered), but the entrees ranged from fair to poor. The sauce on the lasagna and eggplant dishes tasted burnt, and the eggplant was sliced way too thick to be flavorful. Eggplant Parm or Rolatini is not for the lazy chef who doesn't have the time to do the painstaking preparation. The worst was the linguini in white clam sauce. It tasted like somebody dumped an entire container of peppercorns into what otherwise might have been a good entree. Consequently, the mild taste of the clams and pasta was completely destroyed by the flamethrower heat of pepper - NOT what linguini with clam sauce (red or white) is supposed to taste like. (What is this? Mexican-style Italian?!) Pesto's is fine as one of those trendy wine, appetizer and dessert bars, but for a real Italian meal, it leaves a LOT to be desired. They might also consider having waiters offer fresh grated cheese (Even the Olive Garden chain does that!)",

That is more comfortable to me. Pestos only has stall tables. Most of them are the high tables that I find uncomfortable. If you are willing to pay more solely for being is a good environment than so be it. I'm not though. I will pay for good food, but nothing here tasted that amazing.

I think the atmosphere was for a 40+ scene. There was only one other couple in the 20s or 30s there.   For happy hour, the well drinks weren't bad (I get vodka and diet coke). The food though I thought could have been more for a $5 \"happy hour\" price. I know it's on discount, but I didn't realize they were such small portions. The pizza was good, but we stayed until after happy hour was over and my friend ordered a slice of pizza. It was HUGE, and I probably could have just gotten 2 slices for the same price as my 6\" pizza.   They need to get some booths in there, they only had high top tables and just one or two lower tables. It's like they want a bar scene, but for a much older crowd.   Overall a bit pricier than what I like for a pizza joint, but I would consider getting just the pizza to go since the dough was good. Also, it's in a very sketchy strip mall area.

Our water glasses were never half way empty. A must try if you're in the neighborhood!",

    "text": "Recently(5/2015) went there again to meet a friend, same impression...male owner is a serious buffoon !  I live near this place and have over the last 5 years tried it many times. That said it is sad when someone is an owner and does not greet you or offer to get you a (overpriced) drink when you sit down and the bartender is busy ..this is typical not an exception.        The female half of Pesto's is nice and attentive and genuine but the male half is a turd! I will not give business to this establishment simply because of his blase' attidude about clientele.If she divorved him and retained the bar I would go back and tell all my visiting out of town clients to go there too since now I lead them away from there  when asked where to get a good glass of vino and food.        Food is ok and sometimes tasty but overpriced for the amount and quality.         If the bartender is Jason he is outstanding and I hope he gets recruited to work somewhere with more pleasant ownership.        Really just a hang-out for suburban wanna-be wine drinking botox/fake boobs I think I\"m still in college moms and the \" I own a Harley and the t-shirt that says Harley and the bandana that says Harley and a Harley ring and Harley socks\"  inane boring golf -playing overly self-importance Viagra using Harley riding tools disguised as men.",

Except in this instance, I found myself thinking extra hard for anything negative. And well, there simply wasn't anything significantly negative about the experience.   Well, they could use more parking. We got there early enough for a spot. But when we left, the cramped parking lot was already full for dinner.   On to the food. It was great. The bread, pizza, pasta's, desert, etc. Everything was freshly made, seasoned properly, and just tasted good. I wasn't a fan of the tea, but other beverages, wines, all quite tasty.   Service was also excellent. Our waiter was one of the best we've had. Very attentive and friendly. The restaurant itself was classy, very clean, and upscale looking.   As you can see, the negatives are quite a stretch. The important stuff was all great. While we probably won't be back in AZ anytime soon, we'll certainly visit again in the future.",

Upon entering the fantastic locale, we made her way to the seats amongst the wine barrels and mystical selection of delectable grape essence.  Thomas, sprightly little fellow that he is, screwed out from the pantry with gusto and enthusiasm like a fairy from Avatar, welcoming us to the restaurant and offering us Libations and jovial enthusiastic menu options.  The menu options that he suggested paired perfectly with the Italian wine flights that my companion and I thoroughly enjoyed, and along the way, Thomas was certain to ensure that we were topped off with liquids and offered a varietal of appetizing snackums.  And every interaction with Thomas, my lovely counterpart was mesmerised and amused. His conversation is engaging and his energy is genuine. I couldn't think of a better compliment to give anyone so I will leave it at that.   Oh, and by the way, the food is magnificent!",

We chose the chicken caesar salad, chicken wings, meatball subs, charcuterie, cheese plate, and two glasses of chardonnay.  We got all of this for under $50!  What a deal!  Everything tasted wonderful, but I have to say that the chicken caesar salad was probably the best I've ever had.  I know, a salad, but it was so good!  The combined charcuterie and cheese plate was also really good.  They make their jams in house and they add something special to the plate.  I really can't wait to return and maybe try the bacon wrapped dates.  Yum!!",

The restaurant was slow so I didn't feel a need to double check my order.  Of course when I got home, a side of sausage was missing.   The food is what I expected it to be, not great but not horrible.   I called them to let them know about the missing side.  The kid didn't know how to handle the situation.   I got put on hold for 5 minutes.  They only would credit me back for the missing item.  No offers of vouchers, no discount, barely an apology.  A horrible experience.

My friends and I walked into Pesto's and the first thing I noticed was the ambiance. This establishment was dimly lit, very nice, and super clean. We were quickly seated and we all ordered a few cocktail.   I, of course, ordered the chicken wings as an appetizer. And dare I say it... the chicken wings were pretty damn delicious! Definitely top three best wings I've ever had. I ordered the cracked crab alfredo pizza as my entree, and baby, let me tell ya, this too was a delicious choice! The only compliant was the service was a little slow, but our server was great, friendly, and super helpful when answering all our questions.

We ended our meal with my favourite dessert Tiramisu cake. The lady fingers were soaked to perfection and the layers were yum! The service was very good as our waiter took care of our needs completely. He was very quick and prompt. I loved their ambience. They have a bar and the dining area has high stools.

We both really wanted some chicken pesto pasta, and while we were dressed far more casual than everyone else, we didn't feel too out of place. The atmosphere is so awesome! We ended up coming back the next week to eat more of their truffle fries!   We always end up arriving close to close, so their specials were always almost all sold out. However both times they had a variety of new options, on top of their many stable menu options.   All of the food and drinks we tried were delicious but man, those truffle fries alone are what keep calling me back!",

The eggplant pizza may not sound like something you'd normally try, but you'll love eggplant after eating this pizza. The eggplant rollatini is amazing. The lasagna is to die for. The ambience makes for a great date night or girls night. They have a really good happy hour. I love their wine flights and the owner is great about suggesting wines. I did not think I liked Cabernet before she introduced me to one. They have unique wines and are very knowledgeable about wines here. My only criticism on the food would be the garlic bread. It's on the dry side and it's not all that well seasoned. I would also say they need friendlier service. They are efficient but not as personable as a five star restaurant should be. That said, I will go back again and again!",

We all love fried calamari, so we always like trying it out at new places.  The fried calamari is light and crispy.  Also, it's not salty compared to a lot of Italian places we've gone too.   Hubby ordered a special that was offered at the time we dined in; it was a cheese ravioli with homemade pesto sauce.  I ordered their shrimp with linguine and their homemade tomato/marinara sauce.  All their sauces are homemade.  Both dishes we're really tasty and fresh, really delicious!  Go check this place out if you like Italian food.  They have live music!  Good music.  But, the only complaint I have is: That night they had a live band playing and it was kinda loud for me.",

Let me break it down for you, we ordered by phone for carryout service as we didn't want to miss the State of the Unions speech.  Our order included The House salad, Greek Pasta, Eggplant Parmigiana and Tiramisu for desert.  Yum right! The House salad was made with Iceberg lettuce that was still in large clumps garnished with out of the bag croutons. To its credit the lettuce was crisp and very fresh. With a name like Pesto's I expect romaine and homemade croutons.  The entrees of Eggplant Parmigiana and Greek Pasta were flat in taste, no personality at all.  They came in large portions as if to divert the lack of flavor with size, no bueno.  We counted on the desert of tiramisu to save the day.  This turned out to be tiramisu layer cake, delicious but not classic tiramisu by any stretch.  This meal cost $50, my expectations were higher and I know they can do better, I've tasted it.",

Both were mediocre at best, and felt like they could have come from Pizza Hut, not a nice restaurant.  The pizza had a crust akin to take and bake pizza from grocery store. I'd been better off going next door to Frys and getting a pizza; at least that wouldn't have set me back $20. Terrible value, and the pizza was barely average at best. Anyone who thinks this is one of the better pizza joints in Phoenix is an utter tard.  Calzone was the same story. Small, mostly crust, and not particularly tasty.   Very limited beers on tap, too.  From my table in the dining room, I was very disappointed to see at least two microwaves in non-stop use in the hour I was there. Unacceptable in an establishment charging premium prices for reheated shit.   Better options out there, especially for the money. Unless you're a late 40's \"sociallite\" that thinks it's cool to order mediocre food and 13 glasses of wine in a strip mall restaurant in Chandler, then I would avoid this place unless you have money to throw away.",

    "text": "I would like to say first that the place has good service and I know they are trying hard to create unique flavors in a strange location. Which is mildly being factored but, I have to be real and with giving a less than positive review I will give feedback that will improve it next time.  According to YELP 3 stars means \"Yah I am a fan\" and I could not give them that 3 I came here with a couple friends and let a non foodie friend suggest this place because it was his Bday and he heard from friends it was good...  We ordered : $8 ish Sweet Potato Fries with Duck Confit- This was one of the things that I kinda liked even thought the duck was dry and was presented as an almost\" pulled pork style\" What really could of improved this would of been some type of dip of sauce to go with it. Something that might reflect a confit glaze with texture.   $10 Bacon Dates- This is something that if you are going to serve Tapas style that you do right because it is standard on any Tapas menu. The bacon was soggy and falling off and the dates were really hardly stuffed. CRISPY BACON is is critical though for this dish.   $12 Prosciutto and Melon- UGH it should been a red flag when they misspell it on the menu and when you ask the waiter all he can say is that people come here just for the dish but doesn't have any personal opinion. So on paper it sounds like an interesting dish and it could be possible delivered but, it is difficult to do. The dish here is served with bug chunk of melon of small prosciutto slices on top with Saba drizzled and feta scattered on the plate with a poached egg. All the ingredients I love but, if this was \"Chopped\" the judges would say that you just threw them all on the plate without really combining into flavor. The melon was too big and sweet with the minimal prosciutto and the saba/feta was more on the plate than on the dish while the egg just was hard to use for anything except by itself. How can you fix this?? 1. longer thinner melon slices turn it more into a vessel while being able to add the prosciutto as True layer of same size. 2. I would try a qual egg which would fit perfectly 3. then drizzle the saba directly with a sprinkle of feta and it is all on their like a great umami finger food.   $9 or $10- Pork Belly Mac and Cheese- The worst thing here by far and this really can be categorized as BAD overall! Alfredo noodles, runny Alfredo Sauce, under fried pork belly and cheese on top then bake it BOOM Mac and cheese!! Oh man I can't believe this actually made it to a menu without some type of vetting. It really was not mac and cheese because all the cheese was a sauce on the bottom of part of the baked cheese on top. The pork belly was cut really small and was just fatty and mushy without any real crisping or frying. This idea is good but, actually put work into it! Make a sauce with the noodles already in it.   $18 Alfredo Pizza- Sausage, Spinach, Sun dried tomatoes and Alfredo sauce- Super cheesy if you like think really creamy cheesy flavor which is super 1 note. Could use more spice but, this is exactly what you order is what you got. So, I can't say to change it however the crust is not very crispy and hard to eat with hands. I had to knife and fork it.   So overall I am not saying don't go here, food choices in Chandler are fairly limited and I assume if you are really into wine you can ignore my review since this is food related. I am just saying the food needs major improvement and the prices are set for something much more high end than what you are getting.",

Food was really wonderful. But what took this experience over the top was our server, Carice, she was patient with each family member that had a million questions, she was attentive and  listened to what we were saying and made suggestions based on that (every suggestion she made was spot on!) We will definitely be back!",

Service that night was not great, the kitchen seamed to be behind, some people were complaining but we did not, it was obvious our server was a bit overwhelmed.  And because he knew we were waiting quite a long time he took our appetizers off the bill, nice of him.  We had shrimp cocktail and the shrimp were large and fresh and the cocktail sauce was very good.  We also had the Alfredo crab pizza OMG!!! never had crab on a pizza but it was so good, rich, but so very good.  Ended the meal with some gelato, fresh, creamy, hit the spot.

The hostess, assuming the manager, immediately asked very pointedly \"Can I help you\" when I simply LOOKED into the bar.  She said they are very busy but she can seat me at the only spot left.  I thanked her, not knowing bar seats were not open seating.  I was awkwardly placed on the end, where she asked a woman to move her purse to allow me to sit.  WOW!  For the entire 40 minutes I was there, this woman openly complained about me sitting there, gave me several dirty looks, dramatically moved her wine glass over, dramatically slid her food... as if I was going to eat it or something.  Clearly she was a regular because the bartender spoke to her in a friendly manner and ignored me.  I was so uncomfortable the whole time.  The lady continued to make comments about me for 40 minutes!  I was approached by a bar back, ordered the bacon wrapped fig appetizer and wine.  Five minutes later the bartender asked what I wanted, I said the bar back took my order, and I then watched her tell the bar back my order.  UM? Why did you ask what I wanted if you aren't going to put it in to the kitchen?  The figs were overly sweet and mushy after about 3 of them. Could have used some cheese or something to cute the sweet flavor.  Overall, it was not a good experience.  Staff was not very friendly unless you are a regular.",

Then for the next 20 minutes we're completely ignored, not even water. After about 20 minutes, the same waiter, Brandon, who was attending to the table next to us, come to find out was our waiter. He finally came over to take our order. In the whole twenty minutes not even an acknowledgement eventhough he had walked past us 5 or 6 times. I would have understood if he had simply said it will be a few minutes but just to be ignored not knowing who was our waiter was annoying. The food was small but delicious thus the three stars. They had also ran out of dessert. Won't be back.",

The proprietors Frank and Deb know their regular customers and treat them like family, something you don't see in the restaurant business much anymore.  Given the paucity of fine dining in downtown Phoenix, the trip out to Chandler is worth it to eat here.  Next time we're in town, we'll be back.",

They are impressive, gourmet.   Service is friendly, genuine. The owner Debbie is AMAZING, she CARES. Like a friends' place. Atmosphere is classy, relaxed elegance. There is background music playing, but you can have a conversation without raising your voice.  SLEEPER TIP: CHECK OUT the cocktails menu!! I've always ordered wine. Finally saw the cocktails list - these are NOT the boring cocktails. These are CRAFT. The owner made my Hibiscus Kick all fresh. I was SHOCKED at how delicious & balanced it is... I expected too sweet... I'M delightfully WRONG!  In a sea of chain restaurants, I LOVE this neighborhood place!",

The reviews seemed too be awesome, so we Ubered up on a Saturday.  The wife and I sat at the bar and the ambience was great.  The bartender, Andy(I believe) was very attentive and told us about the chefs specials and some of his favorites.  We ordered the bacon wrapped dates and a shrimp cocktail to start, plus a bottle of Disruption Cabernet Sauvignon.  Yummy all the way around so far.  I ordered the chefs lobster pommadora special and the wifey ordered the lasagna.  I was so excited that a chef had lobster pommadora, until It was served.  The sauce was extremely bland.  I was willing to keep eating it because of the \"lobster\" that was to come.  Unfortunately, the lobster did not show up in the dish. I was so pissed off.  I was served a plate of egg noodles with mushrooms that tasted like beef stroganoff.  It was like they took beef stroganoff, took the beef out, and called it lobster pommadora.   I started to dig through the egg noodles to look for lobster.  I found two small pieces of something chewy,but nothing that resembled or tasted like lobster.  We should have listened to the bartender and ordered the pizza.....so bummed.  We will continue to look for good places with great chefs.  Peace...John and Cyn",

I appreciate places that have seasonal items and have menus that change with the seasons. Pestos has regulars that are very polite and mature and the staff greets them very warmly.    Started the evening with an old fashioned,I asked what fruits they use and got a weird look from the bartender. I then asked if they had sugar cubes, and I got that, \" this guy is going to be a pain stare\". I decided to stop asking questions at the point and just take what I got.  Ordered calamari and wings off the happy hour menu. Both were good. The wings had a very deceiving spiciness to them which I enjoyed.   Wife had the Halibut off the specials and I had the duck. The sides were good but the protein on both entrees missed the mark. The halibut was well done (overcooked) and the bloodline was visible. The fat was not rendered off the skin of my duck which made it rubbery. Very poor execution on both dishes.  Dessert was a complete let down for me. I ordered an expresso and ricotta cheesecake,which sounds to die for, but I got what looked like a store bought tart shell filled with chocolate pudding and topped with chocolate mousse and whipped cream. You seriously needed to stab the crust to break it. My wife ordered a banana tart with the same issue - the spoon literally bent on trying to eat it.  All in all, $175+ spent on a less than average meal.",

I think because we always come early or late for lunch or dinner, we never have a wait.  Nice little gem, tucked away in a shopping center.  Give it a try doubt you'll be disappointed.",

    "text": "Lovely family own restaurant. A True neighborhood gem.  Awesome service and really comfortable.  They have more high tops than regular tables so be aware if you go with kids our elder people.  I tried the calamari, cauliflower, custom pizza, pineapple Canadian bacon pizza and the lasagna. Very solid and well presented dishes.   Be aware, servings are big.  Fit desert I had the chocolate lava cake with hazelnut ice cream. There was no hot chocolate filling :'( the I've cream was delicious though.  Highly recommended and we'll be back and try other dishes (beet salad for sure).  So the missing star is because there's room for improvement. Which for them will be really easy to do.  Prices are fair.  Cheers",

    "text": "So so good! Great wine and liquor selection for starters. Our server Noah was great and very attentive for the restaurant being so busy. We ordered the caprese and olives for apps. They both were delicious. We also ordered spaghetti and meatballs, the grilled chicken ziti dish, and Alfredo linguini, all had great flavor. The grilled chicken dish was the favorite of the table! We will definitely be back. Tip - make a reservation, especially for the weekend nights! Great patio too with fans and misters, it's actually very nice outside on their patio!",

    "text": "Went there for lunch.  Very CLEAN and love the fish tank!  The lunch menu is poor with few selections, but of those selections you will find something to delicious.  We went with with the salad and cheese pizza.  The salad was filling and the dressing very tasty. The cheese pizza was huge and very good.  I love pizza and want to try out places that claim to be the best and this place was really good.  Not as good as NYC, but still really good.  The staff was friendly and our food was out in a timely manner.  The prices are HIGH, but that is to be expected for good Italian food.",

Oh and they nailed the lava cake-- highly recommend saving room for this desert. This is definitely a local gem and the owners always make you feel welcome and always remember you the next time. Great staff, great food, great place!",

    "text": "After going to see Eat, Pray, Love, of course there was nothing I was craving more than authentic Italian food!!! I've been here before for lunch and dinner, so Pestos was the first place that popped into my head. This place apparently has been around for YEARS and I'm not surprised-their food is amazing! I ended up getting take-out rather than braving the bar solo (there's also a separate dining area) and ordered the linguini with white clam sauce (it was to die for!), mozzarella sticks with marinara, olives (not a huge fan of the sesame bread that comes with it), and OF COURSE a cannoli for dessert! The linguini was perfectly done and the clam sauce was amazing with just the right amount of clams. The mozzarella sticks were so-so, nothing special about them that I was thinking I should have gotten the stuffed mushrooms instead...these I KNOW are worth it...oh well, next time. The olives (an appetizer) were a delightful blend of 4 or so different types and it definitely hit the spot-I love olives!! They come with sesame bread, which I'm not really a fan of but I was craving carbs so I smothered some butter on it and was over it pretty fast. Now, I have NEVER had a cannoli as delicious as the ones I've gotten from Pesto's! Ever. These are absolutely melt-in-your-mouth amazing! From the chocolate chips inside to the crushed pistaccios outside sprinkled with a little powdered sugar and a fresh, crispy shell, your mouth will thank you!! Everyone that works here is absolutely amazing! It's a family business and their pride of ownership shows in everything they do. I've NEVER had bad service here and even when they're over-run with the high schoolers (note to self: don't go during Seton's lunch hour), their service has always been top-notch! I highly recommend checking them out-even if it is just for an amazing cannoli! =)",
