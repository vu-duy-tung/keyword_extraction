I give the place only 2 stars because of the very slow service. And I did not like their pop music, I think rock or jazz/blues music would suit this place more. Good place for single men, the waitresses all wear skimpy clothes. No equivalent benefits for single women, though...",

They have over 60 beers on tap and others in bottles. Wines and a full bar are also available. I really love their patio with is mostly enclosed and well ventilated with ceiling fans but if you need to be cooler go into the main bar area and enjoy the entertainment from a live band or karaoke (with a live band) that sits up behind the taps at the main bar.   I have found the servers to be rather attentive and friendly. But each time I have been there they have not been \"slammed\".   The last time I ate here I tried their beets and greens salad with candied pecans. I would have preferred the goat cheese crumbled on the salad with the pecans and not watered down in the \"dressing\" that coated the salad. It would have been much better with a light champagne or even balsamic vinaigrette. Underwhelmed and slightly disappointed I ate the beets out of my salad and half the greens. It was quite a generous portion. My dining companions both opted for the pulled pork Cuban sandwich, which they both seemed to enjoy.   I work and live near by and I have and will continue to go back and enjoy my occasional happy hour, lunch or late night at Copper Blues....",

However, when I visited Copper Blues on 2/4/12 prior to the comedy show next door I will definitely be hanging out after events.  Here's Why ... They have a live band and over sixty beers on tap.  It's a nice cozy environment especially if you sit outside.  Budweiser drafts were only $5 and soda was only $3.  We didn't try their food but I hear the same owner owns both Copper and Stand Up Live so I am sure the kitchen is the same so I am confident in saying that the food is delicious because it was at Stand Up Live.  Happy hour is 4PM to 7PM Sun-Thurs so its basically perfect when any event is taking place during on those days.  On this Satuday night people were having a good time.  The draft beer was perfect and fresh.  The music was good and the bartender was real friendly and answered all of our questions cheerfully.  We had such a great time that me and my wife are going back to Copper Blues on 2/23/12 to hang out and drink with friends prior to our comedy show next door.  This is a nice spot and you have to check it out especially if you are going to the show next door !",

    "text": "I've been getting pretty beer-y for awhile now, and LOVING Copper Blues! With their ridiculous selection of beers on tap and $1 beer shots during happy hour, I am able to sample a wide variety of craft and local brews or a fancy and more whimsical (to me, haha) beer blend and not break my bank.   I love the beer shots for sample tasting, and also for the reason that you don't have to be a decider, because I'm really not. Order 4 different brews and if you don't like one, it's only a buck and you don't have to disappointedly chug down  of a pint.  The House Chips on the HH menu are freshly made kettle-style potato chips drizzled with hot sauce and cheese... I was skeptical but now I can't walk in without ordering them. I haven't actually dined here, just grazed during HH. Friends have liked the flatbread pizzas here, and it seems to be the consensus.   All of the waitresses I have been served by are pretty good about suggesting a choice, or describing something on their menu, though you probably wouldn't guess it by looking at them. I swear I'm not being rude, it's just a nice surprise when a waif-like blonde girl with those dumb feather extensions has something of substance to say about a stout.  Also, their stage set-up for live music is awesome. It is directly behind all the taps at the indoor bar (or stage bar) and gives the whole room a great view of whoever is wailing. Plus, Vinyl Station plays here, so that's pretty much an instant 50 pt bonus.  For the most part, I love where downtown Phx is going with the whole CityScape thing. Copper Blues is now one of my go-to places for an after work drink or a weekend night out downtown. We actually got to try this place before they officially opened as they participated in the Spring Fling pub crawl even though their grand opening wasn't until the following weekend. The waitress gets bonus points since she successfully coerced one of my party members to try a local beer rather than the Coors Light he ordered, and he liked it!",

After I figured before I hop onto the light rail back to my vehicle I'd stop in here for a beer, a fellow co-worker recommended this place to me.   When you walk in, there are about 60-70 bers on top, VERY attractive to a \"beer connoisseur\" as myself. I ended up just happening to talk to the bartender \"gabby\" who actually I know from my side of town, (the north west side of town). I did not eat here, just had a few different IPA's and watched 2 bands played, very decent place if you're downtown.",

    "text": "Why, hello Copper Blues, it's nice to meet you! I joined a good friend of mine for the opening this past week and had pretty decent experience. Let's just dive right in shall we?  The Atmosphere: my friend and I were lucky enough to grab a booth in the bar, since it was literally standing room only. The booths are very comfortable cushion wise, however since the place was very very busy, it made it hard to get out of the booth once you got in the booth. It seems that the tables have been placed too close together to comfortably move about during peak dining hours. I'm only about 115 lbs and I had to excuse myself to the woman at the table next to me every time I wanted to get out from behind the table, not to mention climbing over purses etc due to proximity. The musician that was playing on stage provided a lighthearted atmosphere, with acoustics that didn't blow your eardrums out either. Nicely done. Also, I love the lighting scheme, and the views from the patio.   The Food: For the opening event we were lucky enough to be able to try various samples of food. I loved the green pea guacamole, the filet bites and the mac and cheese of course. Since we only got to try the sample sizes, I found myself definitely wanting more. I cannot wait to go back and try a full plate! I ordered a glass of the house Cabernet and suffice it to say I think I'll get something else next time. The cab lacked the full bodied flavor I was looking for and actually tasted very sweet for some reason. Anyhow, that is shame on me for ordering wine in a beer-oriented place.   The Servers: I found that the servers were all very nice, but hopefully over the coming weeks they work on their flow. Since Copper Blues is connected to Stand Up Live comedy theater, you can bet that every night prior to a show it IS going to be very busy just as it was for the opening. That being said, they did not offer the full menu or specialty cocktails for the opening, which will undoubtedly make the servers job more challenging on a busy night. The servers will need to work on their speed and organization if they are truly going to be able to keep the customers happy with their serving time. For the opening, I found that I had what I call a \"ninja\" server. I would order a drink, and just as I was getting to the point of \"Where in the heck did my server go to get my cocktail\", all of a sudden it would magically appear on the table and I would see the server walking away. Very nice server, seemed to be knowledgeable about the products, just a strange flow.",

She helped us choose from their huge selection of draft beers and made sure we were aware of the current happy hour deals. Scored some free Oktoberfest suspenders too!

They always have a great selection of beers on tap to choose from and every time I've gone, there has been an upbeat live band playing. I tend to sit away from the stage because it can get pretty noisy and hard to hear those in your party. The waitresses have always been attentive and helpful when suggesting new beers to try as well. I've never ordered food from Copper Blues but I always see several rounds of their giant nachos being brought to tables. (I'm assuming this is a favorite for many) My visit on 2/7/15 was no different then what I have summarized above. There was a fun band playing and although the place was full we were able to find a table in the corner. Our waitress was sweet and always made sure our water and beer glasses were full.

The windows overlooking city scape actually pull down so you can have a cold beer al fresco. The staff was friendly and the drinks were well priced (I think $6 for most beers). The only drawback I had was I ordered a mixed beer that was supposed to be blue moon and milk stout but they couldn't get the milk stout to work, so they just substituted Guinness for it. I still drank it, but would have liked them to ask if I minded. Not a huge deal, just a bit presumptuous. Overall cool place to have a beer, nice addition to Cityscape.",

    "text": "Copper Blues is awesome!!!  We were in town for a company convention, and trying to arrange for a team dinner seemed impossible but through the amazing help of KC, Ryan and Kate, we were able to set up a team luncheon for 120 people and it went flawless! Kate was able to create a menu that fit within our budget, the food was great, came out fresh and on time. We blocked out the entire restaurant so we had access to the stage and microphone and that was the cherry on top!  We were only expecting 60-80 people at first. But about  2 hours prior to the lunch I notified Kate and she was quick to respond and work with the kitchen with our new numbers. The restaurant doesnt usually open till 3pm, but the crew was able to get some staff to come in early to serve us, so I have to commend the girls that ran the floor, because they  were able to keep up with the crowd, was very attentive to each guest and still had a smile at the end!  We usually have a convention in Phoenix once a year, so I definitely know where my to-go place is. Thanks team, you guys were awesome.  Aside from our team luncheon, this place is just great. Awesome vibe, their renovation is impeccable, the beers on tap has a huge variety, clean, big space and you can try to get tickets to the Stand Up Live comedy shows next door. The food is great as well.",

The great management personally came over to our group and was more than sincere and generous just making sure that we were all having a great time. Great live music lead to a fresh and enjoyable night. Will definitely visit again.",

Fortunately the venue had plenty of room.  Copper Blues was located in the center of the city.  Obviously it is a prime location. There was an Ice Skate Rink outside of the building, and many people were enjoying skating under winter night sky.  I ordered a beer and the copper burger.  Copper Blues had a wide variety of beer. The service was prompt and friendly, and the food was fairly good and satisfactory. Free music made our night more enjoyable.  It was far better than we expected from a random bar on Christmas day.  Thank you Copper Blues for warming up the travelers' hearts on a possibly lonely holiday night.",

Our server was friendly and informative but seemed very rushed which was unpleasant. She made some beer/liquor suggestions and they did not disappoint although I feel my glass could have been filled more (see picture). For an appetizer we got spinach and artichoke which was great but nowhere near enough chips for the dip. Some of the items on the menu weren't available so we opted for the nachos which were OK. When you've been drinking, anything tastes edible. I would come here more for the atmosphere than the food.. Just being honest. Good place to pregame. Free beer shot with yelp check in was cool!",

Service is pretty good--waitresses are always friendly and don't mind if we hang out for a few hours with drinks (after all, that's kind of what the venue is hoping for, I'd think). Prices are average. Not super cheap, but not breaking the bank.   The outdoor patio is also great if you want some fresh air--and they have another bar out there so you don't have to keep running inside if you want another round! All and all, a good time.",

The crowd was diverse and friendly. 25-35 was probably the median. They had a live band playing some good tunes, and when they were on break the music on the speakers was a lot of alternative 90's music which I love and never hear at bars.  I was with a group of about 20 people and we were able to get tables/seats by the bar without any problem (something you have to pay dearly for in Scottsdale.)   They also had 30+ beers on tap. I tried a 10.5% hoppy beer whose name escapes me. It was quite good. If I had any complaint it would be that the drinks are a bit over-priced... even for someone who frequents Old Town often.  Next time I'm in the area, I will definitely be back.",

It's a cool downtown venue that actually gives you that urban big city vibe we lack here in Phoenix, which I always find strange since we are a big city! The waitresses were wonderful and cute, and there are LOTS of beers on tap so the hubster was happy, while I drank the Mojitos which were delicious and refreshing ona hot summer night!   The crowd  is eclectic and mixed ages, and I would say a little more toward the \"trendy\" side but not like Scottsdale crowds, and definitely not many hipsters like you normally find in Downtown venues.

I think we all agreed the food was good for the price (we ordered off the happy hour menu), especially considering the location.  The beer selection was exceptional.  Between the four of us, using fingers and toes, we could not count the taps. There was a two piece band playing.  One guy on guitar and vocals, the other played sax and, incredibly, the accordion.  But hey, the were good and I enjoyed their performance even though it did make conversation more difficult. So much for the good news.

A group of 4 people got up and left and I quickly made my move to reserve the 4 seats.  You can't beat live music.  This place is great and I hope it stays open for  while.  Staff is friendly and management is helpful.",

Sat at the outside bar and the bartender promptly greeted me and gave me a beer list. Not being familiar with 80% of the taps, I just asked her to give me a beer, her favorite beer. She asked me what my preferred style was and I told her something dark, but not too dark. She gave me a couple samples and I went with the SanTan Epicenter Amber ale! Amazing! I found it pleasant that she took the time to find me a beer that I would actually enjoy and not just giving me something she randomly picked. There were a couple bartenders, all so attentive and friendly, didn't catch their names, however. Will be back if I'm in downtown Phoenix again!",

Our group was pretty respectful, despite most of us having had a few.  Still, we showed up with cash, credit and great attitudes.    The waitstaff ignored many of us.  One waitress actually pushed me out of the way when I was waiting at the bar for a drink and told me \"you guys need to find seats.\"  I wasn't blocking any walkway, so I think someone just woke up on the wrong side of the bed.    The prior visit to Copper Blues offered me similarly cold/nonexistent service, so I've got a poor taste in my mouth.    Sad, because I love Stand Up Live and Copper Blues was so much more promising than Lucky Strike.",

I asked if it was okay to order food from the bar so that could watch ESPN..I ordered my food and then I was asked to provide a credit card for a tab..A tab for food????. I asked why she needed a card for a tab for food since I said I wanted to eat at the bar. No answer..The wait person stood in front of me while I ate my food..I felt uncomfortable with her watching me. I paid my bill and she walked off with my change and said nothing to me. I guess she assumed the change was for great service I didn't get? I understand that Copper Blues is a popular place for those listening to live music and their beer selection,however,their customer service is lacking respect. I've never had a establishment ask me for a card to run a tab on food? Alcohol yes..food no",

We went here on Sat for my husbands 35th birthday. I called a week ahead of time and reserved a table for 20 at 5pm w/ their concierge (i guess thats what she'd be called). She said we were all set. When we got there at 5 on Sat the hostess didnt see anything about our reservation but said she \"guessed they could accomadate us\". Then throughout the next hour, she proceeded to try and seat people at the other end of our table since not all our people had shown up yet (because of the dust storm) and kept pointing at us and telling the people she was trying to seat that it was our fault they couldnt sit there. Rude. So rude.  Our waitress (Lexy) was great. She was very nice, funny, knowledgeable and attentive. She was one of the best parts of our experience.  About an hour after getting there, we ordered food. Tacos ( that took 45 minutes), the \"Pig\" ( a half lb of bacon w/ maple syrup for dipping that took an HOUR), and a caprese pizza (that took an hour and 45 minutes). Unacceptable. I can do nothing but blame the kitchen for this since Lexy was great. One persons food came out promptly, ours see above, another couple waited an 45 minutes for their pizza that when it came out the very rude male waiter told us it was our caprese pizza when it was our friends pizza. When we told him that we'd waited an hour and 45 minutes for it, he said \"Uh huh.\" shoved it on our table and walked away. Again, SO rude.  One of the managers came over to apologize (cuz the food service didnt improve) he said he'd take 40% off of our check. Fine. Great even. When we got our bill, not only was their no discount like Ernie promised, but he was suddenly no where to be found.  Im so disappointed that this place wasnt better. Thankfully, our friends kept my birthday boy distracted all night so he had no idea that any of this happened, thus not ruining his party.  I wouldnt recommend this place for anything more than a few drinks before or after an event downtown or as a stop on a pub crawl. Very disappointed.",

Copper Blues always has a good band playing which makes for a lively atmosphere. They have a diverse menu with good prices, and the food has never disappointed us. All of this is brought together by fantastic, friendly, efficient service (we love Dre and we always try to sit in her section.)  Not many restaurants can be consistently wonderful, but Copper Blues downtown has proved itself over and over, which is why I gave it 5 stars.",

    "text": "We were at a Rattlers game and our friends messaged us saying they were at Copper Blues and asked us to come meet them. The band was called 34 North and our friends said one of the lead singers wasn't there so they were a little disappointed but my bf and I had never heard them before and we thought they were amazing. Our friends had meals (pizza and burger) and said it was good. My boyfriend and I didn't eat but the food looked and smelled good. It was a little crowded but it was a Saturday night in downtown Phoenix so that's to be expected. I ordered a vodka soda and the waitress brought vodka cranberry. I let her know and she quickly got me the right drink so it was no big deal, it's hard to hear in there and we were right in front of the stage. Great experience for us and I hope they invite that band again because they rocked! They sang lots of cover songs and would even take requests. We'll probably plan better and go ahead and eat there next time too!",

    "text": "Been to Copper Blues a couple of times, but only for drinks until this past Saturday night.   Attended a friends birthday party this past weekend, and when we arrived I told the hostess that I was there for a party that had a reservation. She told me that there were many parties that night, and that one claimed they had a reservation but didn't and she would show me that table to see if it was my friends party. Honestly I thought that was a bit more information than was necessary, and kind of rude. Turns out, it was my friends party so I joined the table.   I was told as I arrived that they had just ordered appetizers. My boyfriend and I ordered beers and even though they took some time to be delivered, the server brought water immediately. The place was packed- Van Halen was playing at US Airways Center that night so we already expected a delay in service.   I ordered the roasted artichoke hearts and they arrived almost immediately. Then I noticed that the rest of the party had not yet received their appetizers. We finished our appetizer (not what I expected- a little soggy but tasty) and our party was still waiting for their food.   Our drinks were delivered quickly- despite the crowd and obviously came faster as the concertgoers cleared out. Our server Lexi was great- you could tell she was \"in the weeds,\" but doing the best she could & did it with a smile.   I ordered a white pizza with tomatoes for dinner. As I was waiting for it, the rest of the parties food arrived. It took my friends over an hour to get their food. The expeditor brought out a pizza and walked right by me to the other end of the table. I tried to get his attention by saying \"excuse me,\" but he repeatedly ignored me. I had to yell (which is not like me)-- \"Excuse me- is that a white pizza with tomatoes??\" He finally turned to me & said, \"No it's a caprese pizza. They got your white pizza. Sorry.\" He then dropped off the caprese pizza to that end of the table and walked away. He had delivered the wrong pizza to my friends who had waited over an hour for their food- and they had already eaten it.   The manager came out & addressed the table, saying that he understood there were some problems with our experience and he would take care of it, even offering to take some of the bill off. As a group, we are more laid back than others, and many of us had worked in the service industry and know that when you're busy, stuff happens. We were grateful for the apology.   The manager then brought out a new white pizza with tomatoes for me. It was delicious and filling!   When I asked for the bill it took at least 20 minutes to get. Then I noticed nothing had been taken off my bill. Instead of arguing at that point, I paid it and still tipped 15%. Despite the awful experience, Lexi did her job and I didn't want to take out my frustration on her. I hope she understood that our table didn't blame her- it seemed like everything had just collapsed.  Finally, when walking out past the hostess stand, I thought it was rude that she didn't thank us for coming. She wasn't busy, she wasn't dealing with customers- she was just standing there & we walked right past her. Now maybe I'm just being picky, but when I worked in the service industry I was always taught to thank the customer. It was their last opportunity to leave us with a good impression and they blew it.   I'm not the kind of person who complains unless something is really bad, so if you've read this rant then thank you. Bottom line- I will probably go back to Copper Blues for a drink as they have a great beer selection, but I don't think I'll eat there ever again.",

Instead, I had the BBQ Drunk Pork, and it was just one of the worst sandwiches I've ever had. Maybe I'm not used to the amount of vinegar they used in the BBQ sauce(just guessing, because it the sandwich was... sour?), but I did not care for it at all. My better-half on the other hand really liked her appetizer and had the pork belly tacos and loved it.

So me and my wing loving posse jumped in the SUV and trekked to Cityscape, enjoyed watching some ice skaters fall, and headed in for these wings. They didn't open for about twenty minutes, so we hung on the balcony, chatting up staff. They all knew we were \"first in line\" As we spoke to ALL of them. Well, as opening time gets closer, several other groups gather up with us to get a seat. Of course, the staff was SO nice to seat them all before us as we watched and said \"Hey\", \"Excuse us\". Etc. We dealt though, because the waitress who finally apologized and sat us was very nice. She saved this review from tragic one star prison. Anyhow, we sat down and all wanted to start with wings. \"Sorry, we have been out of wings since yesterday\". We checked out the rest of the menu, beer specials were not very special at all. So we bailed and went over to Tilted Kilt and had a kickass time. BTW, their wings are not hot, they are whiskey sweet sauced. Just so you know.",

On top of that, I think the live music on Friday and Saturday nights at Copper Blues is the most underrated in the entire Phoenix area. While other locales - Crescent Ballroom comes to mind - attract both big names and indie rock to downtown Phoenix, the group that plays on weekend nights covers all the songs you love to hear. Since they aren't original in that sense, it becomes easier to overlook. That being said, these guys can hit all the notes and perform with an energy that makes you forget you're watching a middle age cover band. It's impossible not to have fun listening to timeless hits.",

Copper Blues reminds me of Martini Ranch minus the thugs and UFC wannabe types in the Shaker Room. (remember when that place was cool?)  I was here last night (Thursday) around 11.30 and saw a decent crowd, but it certainly was not packed. I noticed it picks up some patrons leaving the comedy club when that lets out.

Copper Blues is the perfect decision for pre-show drinks and dinner. The restaurant is attached to the Stand Up Live comedy club and this past weekend my girlfriend and I met up with another couple at the restaurant before seeing Stephen Rannazzisi.   For an appetizer we all really enjoyed the French Onion Dip with some BBQ potato chips, despite my girlfriend's hesitation to order this dish since it was \"something you can easily pick up at the grocery store.\" For the main course three of us got the Copper Blues Burger, which has cheddar cheese, hickory bacon, roasted onions and tomato jam. Usually I'd do without the tomato jam, but I figured the hell with it and kept it on. I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. I have to say, I wasn't expecting it, but I was blown away by this burger and I'm definitely adding it to my list of best burgers in Phoenix. My friend's wife had the Caprese sandwich. Pretty standard, but it looked very good. All sandwiches came with a side of their house made BBQ chips, which we all ended up using to dip in the left over French Onion Dip.   For the beer aficionados there are over 60 beers on tap. Check out their extensive list here:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcopperblueslive.com%2Fpage.cfm%3Fid%3D1028&s=c5832497708103db498595819c4301309e5ecbbced7c01924f98b9104b1f8d3e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">copperblueslive.com/page...</a>  Me?

The Copper Burger was excellent, cooked exactly Medium Rare, as ordered with lots of competing flavors that worked well together. The cooked to order potato chips were, well, probably the best I have ever had.  Their Hummus was good also and I loved their choice of brews.  Now comes the service.  It was a Monday night so it wan't really that busy.  It took about 15 minutes before the server came over to get our drink order, then it took about 10 minutes after that for us to get our drinks.  Then, she disappeared for at least 15 and finally came back for our food order.   I ordered the Hummus that comes with flat bread with an option to add veggies for 3 dollars more.  Sounds reasonable, I wanted veggies, my friend wanted flat bread so I asked to add the veggies.  So what happens, the Hummus comes to the table without flat bread.  So we let our server know, she said she thought I wanted veggies instead of the flat bread (i know, this sounds really boring and mundane but it gives you a good idea how things went) and then went on to say that the flat bread would be a dollar more. Big Deal, $1.  Like I was going to balk at adding a dollar to my check.  In the meantime, the entrees arrived which kind of blew the whole concept as the hummus an appetizer.  The flat bread arrived about half way through us eating our burgers.    With good service, I would have given this place 5 stars.  I am hoping this is just one of those random things and that next time my experience will be better.  I do want to come back because besides the service thing, I love the atmosphere and the food.",

The same cover band has played the last 2 times and all I can say is the sound guy should be fired. The acoustics is not conducive to a live band. The drums cut through everything, the bass was way too high so we had a hard time hearing the guitar, and the vocals. Two vocalists lost their voice in the first set cuz they couldn't hear themselves. It was bad. Plus the setlists had no flow, way too random jumping decades. We won't be back unless forced.",

    "text": "This is the place where the beer flows like wine.  Sorry Lloyd and Harry, you should skip past Aspen and head here. With what looked to be 40+ beers to choose from on tap, grab yourself a cold and frothy one on a moments notice. Order yourself some of their Rockin' Chicken Nacho's, a fig and goat cheese pizza, the southwest burger topped with roasted green chiles and Monterrey Jack cheese, or what can only be described as \"Pig\" on their menu. A 1/2 lb of bacon served with a side of dipping maple syrup.   I've been twice now on a Tuesday for their Open Mic' comedy line up \"Laughs and Draughts\". $3 Santan brews, $6 Chicken and Mac n Cheese, and other nice priced bar foods to choose from like wings. As much as I want to love this local joint for a mid-week night of comedic stylings; unfortunately, I don't think I'll be spending too many more Tuesday's here. There's just something that seems to be missing. No, not the food. It wasn't the drinks, not even the service itself. That's right, the comedy. I'm not sure I laughed but 2 or 3 times the entire hour and a half I stuck it out. The saving grace was that the Olympics were playing on the TV's in the background, but I could have got that same olympic sized entertainment at my own home, and the beer is cheaper there.  If you're looking for a laugh on a Tuesday night, I'd try to stick it out til Wednesday and find your way over to Stand-Up Scottsdale; their open mic is usually worth the time and effort, and its put together in much better fashion - no run on comedians who don't seem to cut the mustard or know when to exit stage left.   They do, from time to time, have live music or a DJ spinning records. Check out their main site for a calendar of events. While I can't speak on those particulars, I imagine you can't really mess up music too badly.   I would like to leave you Yelpers with the following words of advice. If you're out for a great selection of tapped and bottled beer, wine, or liquor in a cool down town atmosphere. Race on down, cause you may have just won gold.  Happy Yelping Phoenix!",

    "text": "Super cute hangout in downtown Phoenix! We were in town over the weekend visiting my best friend for Valentine's Day and were looking for someplace fun to grab drinks and quick bites. Since it was a Sunday afternoon, a lot of the local restaurants were either closed or completely dead. We asked a security guard where all the cool kids hung out, and he pointed us towards Copper Blues.  The decor and ambience at Copper Blues was exactly what we were looking for. The crowd was older (late 20s, 30s and 40s -- not crazy 21-year-old party animals), and the restaurant was decked out in an eclectic array of rock-themed gear and memorabilia. The bar area was open seating, so we selected a high table with bar stools next to the open windows. The bar is located on a covered patio that opens to the street and plaza below, and small herb gardens line the open windows. They have heat lamps in case it gets cold, but on Sunday afternoon the weather was crisp and breezy.  Copper Blues has an awesome menu, but we were a bit disappointed that we couldn't try out more of their food. Since it was Valentine's Day, they were only serving a special menu that had very few selections to choose from -- and even fewer gluten free or vegetarian options (on a side note, their regular menu lists what items are vegetarian and gluten free, which is always a plus in my book). I really wanted to try out their spinach and artichoke dip, but they weren't serving it on their special menu that day. Instead, our table split an order of the brussels sprouts, the filet bites and the cheese board. Everyone loved the brussels sprouts, and the filet bites were delicious -- especially the green pesto dipping sauce. The cheese board was a bit of a disappointment. It had Port Salut, blue cheese and a third variety that I didn't recognize, but the portions were tiny. It was supposed to come with fruit, but they left it off our order. For the price, next time I'd pass on the cheese board.  The happy hour specials here are excellent and are served daily from 3-6pm. They have a huge beer list with tons of local and craft brews, but since I'm gluten free I ordered a mixed vodka drink. I was not impressed by their drink menu, and my vodka drink tasted like pure vodka with a dash of disgusting berry juice in it. I wasn't a fan, and the waitress was awesome and didn't charge me for the drink. Instead, I ordered a $3 house cab sav -- can't beat that price.  Our waitress was super cute and gave us excellent service, and I'd definitely like to give this place another shot the next time we're in town. They have nightly live music, and their full dinner menu has a lot of interesting selections I'd love to try out next time!",

Once they got up ,i went and sat down...the waitress came over and says \"the table is for them\" pointing at a couple that had JUST walked in, i told her the table was empty and i sat first and i had been standing for 30mins plus. She told me she was gonna wait on me and was going to call security, i got extremely upset and instead of causing a scene ,i took my wife and left. NEVER EVER will i go back to this establishment ,and i suggest you look elsewhere for your nightlife, this place has horrible horrendous service! #nevergoingback",

Not to mention, the $3 or $4 (can't remember the price) brown bag special where they pick any can, maybe bottled, beer they are looking to get rid of. So many options! Lastly, I want to give a big shout out to our server, Ashley (the one with the black dahlia tat (AWESOME!)) for being a great host while we're there.

I still love their different types of beer and I love the free live music.  As of now my favorite band is \"Tick Tick Boom\" and there are two others, but I cannot think of their names.   It is a very chill place you see all ages.  They have happy hour from Mon-Fri from 3-6pm.  I recommend this place for a weekend night out.  They also validate your parking ticket, if you park underneath.",

We asked three different waitresses for service and still completely ignored. It is now 5:45pm and we still don't have water. One of the waitress said they are extremely understaffed, which seems to be a management issue. It's no excuse for patrons to be waiting for so long without even being acknowledged. We didn't even get menus. We had to get our own menus. It looks like self-seating, self-grab menu, and being completed ignored was their special for the evening. I guess we were the joke for the night. Completely disappointed.   The steak bites and quesadillas were pretty good though. Probably three stars if it wasn't for the service.  Edit - I changed this from one star to four because the GM, Fabio, came and sincerely apologized. He showed us that this was out of the norm because two people were no shows, and did everything to try to fix our experience. Will try this place again after he did that.",

    "text": "Really one of the better tap selections in the Valley. What it lacks in higher-end Belgians or obscure specialty beers, it makes up for with Arizona taps. And, with those Arizona taps at only $3 during their generous happy hour, this makes for a must-stop bar for beer lovers. Almost every available Valley brewery seemed to be represented, as well as most of the ones in Flagstaff. Impressive. I love the space too. Cityscape is such a cool development and it's nice to see it doing well. But, in the front bar, you've got this great view out of huge open windows. It's a wonderful spot to sit for an after work drink, and it seems as though the clocked out office workers constitute much of their early evening business. I've had good service here, but I don't appreciate their Hooters-style skimpy clothes. It just doesn't seem necessary. The food isn't great, but it's really cheap during happy hour. We had the mac & cheese, and I would more appropriately call it \"mac & grease, with cheese.\" The bathroom (men's, at least), is pretty weird. It looks like that of a very fancy restaurant. I wouldn't be surprised to see a guy in there handing out towels later in the evening. Overall, I really liked this place and have already suggested it to others.",

The music they were playing was not recent, basically 80's dance, not my favorite but some like it. Try to come when there's actually live music playing. It's mainly a bar, with part dancing. Not a place to lounge, it's a restaurant style set up, thought that might be helpful to know. The interior was decorated alright, good use of lighting and color but most of the space was used for restaurant tables. There are some couches you can sit at with some tables.",

    "text": "Overall the place was a pretty good establishment but there were a few things that take it down a few notches in my opinion:  1. The band (The Instant Classics) - while they were pretty decent they kept calling attention to the fact that they were doing more and more shots.  I'm sure that this was to encourage patrons to drink but it was pretty noticeable that they were getting a bit out of hand with their booze.    2. The crowd - obviously the bar and band can't do much about this but when people yell \"freebird\" after every song, the band makes fun of them, it only encourages it to continue and takes away from the music.  3.  The service - I understand that any time you have live music or a club scene, its going to be loud and thus hard for servers to hear.  That being said, when you ask for a water and they bring you a Pumpkin Beer and then charge you for it, that's just bad service.  On top of that when asking for my bill (included my girlfriend, the others in the group weren't ready to leave yet), the first time the server brought me a bill that was completely incorrect, as in not one of the drinks was one that my girlfriend or I had.  The second trip she brought every ones bill EXCEPT for mine.  Apparently the third time was the charm (although it did have a beer on there that wasn't ours which the server acknowledged and removed before running the card).  Lastly, I am not a huge fan of the lack of parking downtown.  They treat downtown Phoenix as if it were San Diego or Chicago with the parking in that its all garages and any little event going on down there gives garages the balls to charge $12 for parking.  Overall the music was good, drinks were decent and okay on price, service left a lot to be desired and the location (downtown) isn't my favorite.",

It was an open bar during the party, so I don't have a sense of how much the drinks are here.  The party was held in early April, so the weather for a party out on the patio was perfect.

O'Dell Brewing 90 Schilling but not the Red Ale? Dos Equis lager but not Amber? (Well maybe 90 Schilling is everyone else's favorite and the Red Ale is just mine.. but no Fat Tire?) Lucky for me though, Kiltlifter is on tap so I am happy.   Happy hour is $3 drafts and $4 crafts. I still haven't figured out who wants/orders a beer shot and why this is available.   The food is just ok. Ordered the trio of dips - beer cheese, guac and salsa. I would just say it's so-so. Not amazing, not bad - but pretty expensive at $11 for what you get. I would skip it for the price.   The Mediterranean chicken sandwich is just ok - the bread is dry and the chicken is sparse. I wouldn't order it again.  This place gets packed on the weekends. Expect long waits at the bathrooms - partially because there are that many people there, and partially because you can't tell which stalls are filled and which aren't.   They have live music on the weekends - which is pretty darn good cover bands. It's a fun atmosphere and the only reason I would dock it down is because the service can be sparse. Also - parking downtown just generally is not awesome. I found that the best place to go is on Washington between 3rd and 4th ave and just walk.",

They had offered 25% off drinks for Comicon guests, and though we drank there most of the weekend wearing our badges, it was like pulling teeth to get the discount (when we managed to get it at all).   It was also nearly impossible to get service, as it took 45 minutes for the waitress who we'd been trying to flag down when we joined an existing table finally showed up tableside, grumpy, and smirky. My $9 chips had maybe 2 teaspoons of blue cheese crumbles around the edges and 1/2 tablespoon of bacon scraps. There were about 15 chips on the plate.  My friend and I ordered well tequila sunrises which tasted like rancid everclear.  The overall impression was decidedly negative, being treated poorly, even if it's just one very rude staff member, is not something I was expecting from a bar I'd enjoyed previously.",

When a few classmates and I  came for a few drinks after class we arrived and sat down at the bar. We ordered a few beers and then had to move to a bigger table to accommodate more people who were coming to join us. After we moved to a table close to the bar just big enough to accommodate all the members in our party a server came up to us and informed us that we were siting in \"HIS SECTION\" and he seemed annoyed to even be there. He continued to look at our table and roll his eyes at our already order drinks. Okay sir I totally understand the annoyance of guests moving around to different tables but in no case is it appropriate to give your customers attitude about moving to accommodate for a larger group of people especially on a slow night when there's plenty of tables open. Our rude server didn't come back over for at least 30 min so we continued to order food and other drinks from the bartender. When he finally came back, we had just received our nachos and more beer and once again he rolled his eyes scoffed and walked away.  We didn't seem him for the rest of the night which was fine by me.  I must say the girl behind the bar was very knowledgeable but she also wasn't too pleasant. The employees seemed to be friendly to one another and cracking jokes but as soon as they were talking to a customer it seemed like a flip was switched and they were now annoyed. I asked a few people that had been in before of what their experience was like they all said they had been in for dinner on a non-music night and the service was awful. Those who had been in during a show said they had a great time and the service was decent.   I must say that this location would be awesome for a music venue which it is... So maybe ill be back for a show but I will not be back for dinner on an off night.",

Whenever I have a planned night out downtown I check the music calendar and if EastonAshe is in the house I make sure to stop in. They play here often and they're one of my favorite, rockin' Phoenix cover bands.   It can get crowded when the bands playing but the outdoor patio is usually a little less crowded so you can at least step out there to get away from the crowd, if needed.   We were offered penny pint tickets on the way in and that was a big score! I'm sure the bartenders love those deals as well. We definitely tip more when the drink is pretty much free! ;)",

We had no trouble getting a seat though (sat at the bar) and got service immediately even though it was pretty much standing room only. The bartender was friendly even though she was super busy and found time to pay attention to us even though she had many duties that evening.   They have a massive beer selection and great beers on draught as well. We did order some nice stuff, but they also had $3 pints of a really nice beer on tap, so we partook in a few of those as well. It's great to see the range in prices- something for everyone.   We even nabbed (ok, were given) glasses from a snazzy beer that they were discontinuing.    We will come back the next time we're in town.",

Comes over & props my knee up, puts ice on it, puts another stool at the end of my foot to make sure nobody runs into my leg, brings me Tylenol since I'm allergic to the ibuprofen they offered me, personally brings me a Bells Oberon instead of having the waitress do it. Seriously way above & beyond. I'm so appreciative!    Two years ago on my birthday I went to the other (now closed) location in Tempe & they had their chef make me a birthday cake.

The bar then extends to a larger room with a bar and stage. This stage area of the bar is huge! There are several clusters of high tables and chairs, so it's not difficult to get your group seated together to enjoy the live band. I didn't think that there was a lot of space up towards the stage for dancing, but I didn't stick around long enough to see how much more packed or how drunker people at Copper Blues could get. I'd say that this place is fun if you're looking for something more low-key or a great spot to pre-game for the night.",

She was friendly, talkative, and easy on the eyes.  The music was set at the right level to maintain conversations, but kept the place lively.  Before we knew it, the bar was packed for happy hour and $1 beer shots.  Everyone was so nice; it was easy to chat it up with the other folks at the bar.

    "text": "The two stars are for the food. We shared a bleu cheese burger and the wedge salad along with the potato chip appetizer.  While I do think it would be difficult to mess up said items, they were very good.  Then again, perhaps it was only the depth of my hunger pangs that had me thinking so....  We dined on a Friday night before a Suns game a couple weeks ago. Since it was a busy day and time, we gave ourselves ample time to enjoy our meal.  What lured me into Copper Blues was its upstairs location which provided a beautiful view and the live music seeping out the open windows of the patio.  This place looked like the perfect spot for a beer and a burger on that mild January evening. And if the service weren't so poor, it would be.   When we arrived at Copper Blues, there was one couple in front of us at the hostess stand and a large sign that said 'Please Wait to be Seated'.  We obliged.  We waited and waited.  There was not a host in sight so finally the couple in front of us flagged a server down who promptly sat them.  By this time, there were a few more parties in line behind us.  The server, having seen the line that had formed, I assumed would alert the necessary staff and/or return to seat the rest of us still there waiting, but she did not.  Again, we waited.  Five more minutes went by until finally, we flagged down security and he sat us- at a dirty table.  It was quickly cleaned and a smiley and sweet server approached us within a few minutes and asked for our drink order.    We ordered a beer and 2 waters.  We got the beer, about five minutes later, and only one water.  We elected to share it and not complain.  We ordered another beer and the appetizer- potato chips and an onion and sour cream dipping sauce.  She returned about 10 minutes later with the beer and we put in our burger and salad.  Then, we did what I was beginning to see was a theme at Copper Blues- we waited.  The appetizer, which was an item that did not need to even be cooked, took 30 minutes. Then, a full hour after placing our order, our burger came out- with chips instead of fries.  We accepted it anyway and did not complain.  The salad had been forgotten but she assured us it could be out quickly.  The sweet server apologized once more. It was 10 minutes till tip off now.  We hurried through our meal and left just in time to miss only a minute or two of the game. Phew.  When we attended the Suns game the next Friday night, we went to Tilted Kilt instead.  There was not an unrealistic wait for the food and we didn't miss a minute of the game.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I went here early Saturday evening because we were seeing Brian Posehn at Stand Up Live next door. We arrived about 4:45 and it was pretty calm in there with only a few patrons at the time we arrived.   When we're trying out new places we always like to have a variety... usually an appetizer or two and different main dishes so we can taste each others to get an idea of the overall quality of the food. Of course there is always the beer factor too. We both love beer.  The beer selection is excellent. They have a ton of local brews and I was impressed that they had Sonoran White Chocolate on tap. On top that that it was only 5 bucks which is fantastic. They have their local brew called the Copper Blues Bru which was decent too. Grand Canyon is good, also on tap. The only thing it was missing in my opinion is that they did not have Moose Drool. It seems so popular here in the valley and I can get it at so many places I was suprised with their wide selection they didn't have it. No worries though this just encouraged me to try new things. The waitress never left me waiting for another beer and was always there when we needed her.  As far as the food goes we started out with the mac and cheese and added bacon to it. We make mac and cheese at home all the time and believe me it's good mac and cheese. Especially smoked in the smoker for an hour or so. So we always have high expectations of mac and cheese and man this didn't disappoint. The cheese was nice and creamy and the bacon was nice and crispy! The flavor was fantastic and they added just shreds of green onions on top to bring it all together. We both were thoroughly impressed.   For dinner I had the Southwest Burger. I ordered it medium and it came rare which I don't mind. I always order medium so there is room for error. Some may have sent it back though. My girlfriend did give it a try although she does NOT like rare meat at all. We both had the same reaction though. The burger was incredibly juicy and very good. One of the better burgers I have personally had in a long time. The only knock though is nothing stood out to make it a \"Southwest\" burger. The rest of the flavors did not do enough. The burger itself took center stage though. I ordered fries with mine and they were decent.   Brandi ordered a Turkey Club sandwich with chips. Really you can't mess up a sandwich. Well I take that back yes you can. All of her ingredients were fresh and piled high. It was a nice large sandwich on a ciabatta bun cut in half. Just the right amount of all of the ingredients to make the sandwich what it should be. Everything worked good here unlike the burger that drowned out all the extras this was the perfect blend of ingredients. The chips were home made and crunchy. I personally love chips like this. The flavor was good and it was a good portion.  Overall it was a good experience for us. The time we went was just right. In at 4:45 and out at 6:00 to catch the show next door. We were done eating before that but just sat and had a few beers while waiting for the doors to open next door. We didn't feel rushed to get out or anything and that is a good thing. One last thing. You can take a beer over next door too... it won't count against your minimum at Stand Up Live though which is understandable.",

The stage is set up in a pretty awesome way - behind all the beers.   With all the great things going for it, a few things felt off...for starters, the band playing was not the band listed on their website.  It wasn't even a bluesy band - just some rock cover band! I was wanting to kick back with some blues that evening, but instead got a cover of \"Your Sex is on Fire.\"   Also, what is up with the pea guacamole??! There is NO avocado in it (literally, its not just me being picky) - it is just mashed up peas with onions and garlic and lime.  I think that qualifies as a yummy pea DIP, but with guac, you need some avocado!",

    "text": "Meh.  Not a bad place, I suppose... just not that special. Great beers on tap, I'll give them that, but it's a bar experience you can have at a dozen other places, honestly. If you're already downtown for some other reason (Suns game, dbacks, etc.) it's a decent place to grab a drink and some food, but not a destination place. I'd probably flip a coin between Copper Blues and Tilted Kilt, and not really care where I ended up. (both try to over-compensate for any potential shortcomings by subscribing to the \"dudes like boobs\" theory.)  Why 2 stars? It's a mix. Service wasn't great, and I think i was just a little disappointed in the general atmosphere - I was really hoping Phoenix had actually gotten a Blues bar. This is just a bar with \"blues\" in the name. I mean, the band was playing covers of top-40 hits. I mean... really? I guess I was hoping for some kick-ass old dude sitting in a chair in dim lighting that can rip out a couple BB King tunes. Or a great jazz quartet to pound out some Miles Davis. Oh well.   Guess I'm just sick of bars trying to pander to the hip, college / scottsdale crowd. There's such a gaping hole in the \"blues - jazz club\" scene in Phoenix  (by \"gaping hole\" i mean \"none\") and I was hoping this could help fill that hole. Guess not.",

So far I've only been for happy hour, which is great because they offer deep discounts on local beers.  I'm definitely looking forward to sampling some of the food options.   My one complaint - most of the songs we heard here (I've yet to see a live band here) were horribly outdated top 40 hits that I wish I had forgotten about.  Clearly that's a matter of taste though ;) Looking forward to going back!",

One of the nice things is that you can buy a drink here and take it to SUL.  Though it doesnt count as your two drink minimum.    Their appetizers are pretty tasty.  We ordered their beef tips which were delicious and also an order of their wings.  The wings were ok, but nothing fancy.    My only beef would be that when a live rock band goes on, they forget that it's a restaurant/bar and crank the volume as if they were in a 20,000 person arena.  Over all good place and we always go here before a show.",

I am not a big fan of finally being seated and then having to wait and wait for someone to take my drink order.   I had the Carolina Pizza.   It came with pulled pork, BBQ sauce, and fried onion strings on top.  It was really good, and definitely a high of the evening.

I have never seen so many beers on tap in one place in Central Phoenix so needless to say I think I've found my new downtown post-work watering hole. The bartenders are friendly and attentive and it's just a cool place to hang out. I have to go back to the beer selection again because it really is breathtaking.

    "text": "Copper Blues has become my go-to place downtown. Let me share some observations:  Pros:  1. Love the feel of this place. The design of the stage behind the bar with the tap handles on full display is pretty awesome.  2. Enclosed outdoor patio (never good at describing these things) is well designed. Less noise from the band out here. Great view of Downtown. Few more TVs if you want to watch the game.  3. The beer selection is fantastic. Over 60 beers on tap. They will have the beer you are looking for, including some local brews on tap.   4. If you sign up for their Around the World Beer challenge, you get credit for each different beer you try. Try all 60 or 64 (can't remember exactly) and you get 2 free VIP tickets to a StandUp Live Show (which is right next door).  5. Solid food choices. Filet bites, Burger, and Cuban Pork Pizza (which may have been a special item for the day) are excellent.  Cons:  1. If it is really busy (usually right before a comedy show starts), you may want to head to the bar and order your drink. Drink service at the tables has been slow at times. As a result I can't quite award that fifth star.  2. This isn't a problem for me since I live nearby and walk here, but if you are coming here after 8pm, skip the parking garage and find a spot on the street, west of 1st Ave usually has some spaces. Somehow, someway, everyone who comes to CityScape seems to have to fork out a small fortune for parking in the garage. There also can be a line if a show has just ended.",

Our waitress (so sorry I can't remember the name!) recommended me a fantastic local beer after I described the type that I like. She even told me about a \"mixed\"  beer she invented from 2 hefefeizens and it was AMAZING! we ordered an appetizer as we waited for our friends to arrive, they were a little late and we were worried about getting good seats for the show next door. Our waitress volunteered to go and reserve us the best spots still available so we could finish our food! When we were ready to head over she escorted us to our table-amazing location- and even carried our drinks. This was above and beyond customer service, by far the best comedy club/restaurant duo I have been to!

When you consider it was a hosted bar and the girls probably weren't making a ton of money in tips their effort becomes even more admirable.  If you like a beer selection that runs 60+ deep, eclectic music, a killer patio with Downtown views, and wading in a sea of attractive people, odds are strong you'll have a good experience at Copper Blues. It really is a beautiful space with exposed ceilings, rich wood floors, gorgeous bars areas, and sumptuous attended bathrooms.  Aaron May's menu is still a bit of an unknown based on last night's samplers but it's hard to doubt the man responsible for so many restaurant successes (Vitamin T, Over Easy, Mabel's On Main, etc.). The big man was in attendance last night overseeing the finger food service, which included caprese on crackers (meh), meatballs (strong), tuna tartare (spicy and delicious) and sweet pea guacamole (five stars). I'm looking forward to getting busy with one of his entrees soon. Copper Blues is a big win for Downtown.",

We'll definetly be back to Copper Blues, we were shown the Happy Hour menu and it tickles us to see so many food items on it!

    "text": "My wife and I were looking for something different to do on New Year's Eve.  We paid $40 apiece for a reserved table including free champagne at midnight.  Part of the attraction was a supposed \"Sideshow\".  The only part of that we experienced was a contortionist- a very flexible young woman! Our table was on the enclosed patio overlooking the skating rink in the center of CityScape.  Fortunately, we were also next to a heater, so it was very comfortable.  We ordered an appetizer- potato nachos- which were good and reasonable at $10.  Our server, Andi, was excellent and I tipped accordingly. The band, \"Instant Classics\" was playing, and were decent as far as cover bands go.  There really isn't a dance floor there, especially since the place became packed around 10 pm.  I look forward to visiting again on a more routine occasion.  It is worth mentioning again that the service was EXCELLENT- even when it became crazy-busy!",

    "text": "I have only been here once, on an early Sunday evening after a few friends and I walked over after a D-Backs game. It was before the evening comedy show crowd arrived. This is the reason I listed noise as average, as I wasn't there when live music was playing.   I like the setup of the place, with an outer bar area in an all glass area; gorgeous view of downtown. The interior bar, like the outer bar, has over 50 (I think around 60) taps. They have everything from your mass-brewed American lagers/pilsners (PBR, Bud, Coors, Miller, etc) and a good selection for the beer geek/snob (Sierra Nevada, Stone, Dogfish Head, etc). If you (over several visits) choose to consume one of each, you get two VIP tickets to Stand-Up Live (the attached comedy club). The interior bar area has some different style seating arrangements (booths that face towards the bar, high seat tables, and a nice wraparound bar by all the taps. There are a couple of TVS for sporting events and whatnot, but this is meant more for background sites than to be that place you go to hear the commentators during a game (I don't get the impression this place is meant to be the hangout during the game, but a great after game spot).   The food was very good, we had a cheese pizza with sun-dried tomatoes, basil oil (tasty). We also got to try a Cuban sandwich pizza; that's right, if you love the pork, cheese (Swiss), and pickles of a Cuban sandwich, you will LOVE this pizza. Overall the beer and food rate from a 4-5.   The owner (who spoke to me and my friends about our first impressions), Peder the head chef, and the on duty manager (Michelle?) were very friendly and answered all our questions. Breanne (sp?) was a very nice, and knowledgeable server. All of the waitstaff was very nice to my friends and I, even when we started to wear out our welcome.   I enjoyed my time here and look forward to going back to complete my beer list. I want to come here during a lunch, and during live music/weekend to make sure I have a complete picture of the place before giving it a five. However, my first impressions are that I will ultimately do just that.",

We came to Copper blues before the comedy show last night; if you have a reservation there, they will also reserve seats for you at the actual show. All 6 of us agreed that our entrees were mediocre at best. My pizza tasted like a bad frozen pie from the grocery store. My friend's tomato soup tasted like ketchup. You get the point.  The only reason for the decent review is that the beer selection is really good and the live music later in the night creates an awesome atmosphere.  Eat dinner elsewhere but stop in to dance after your comedy show is over.",

    "text": "I visited Copper Blues because it is right next to Stand Up Live. My friends and I came here on a Thursday evening before our comedy show started. We were a party of six and seated right away! Service was quick which was awesome since I was so worried about the line for the show after.   We shared a few appetizers: nachos with chicken, spinach and artichoke dip and crispy chicken wings (sweet chili). We destroyed each of them because they were so delicious! I am generally not a fan of nachos, believing its like eating roulette. You either get a great chip or a plan chip; however, these nachos were absolutely fantastic I would definitely get them again! Each plate had a good portion for sharing and none of us were disappointed!  I ordered the Strawberry Fields drink which looks gorgeous but I will warn that it was quite strong. The good news is I definitely know alcohol was in it and I think the bartender must have had a heavy pour. Can't complain when you get your moneys worth!  Overall it was a great vibe with loud music, good service and tasty dishes - I will be visiting again!",

Fries were not included with the burger, and I had to pay extra. The burger and fries were good, certainly not the best I've ever had.  By the time I paid my bill and left a tip, I was up to around 25.00.  I thought that was too pricey for what I received. I probably won't be going back.",

Sometimes it is hard to get a place to sit, but if one waits till after break time of the second band, which is usually around 10:00-10:30, a lot of people clear out.   And, voila!   Lots of places to sit.  I'm not particularly into greasy bar food, so haven't seriously tried their food, but their drinks aren't bad.   Just make sure they don't get watered down as the night gets later.  I like the place.   It's clean.  The restroom is shared by the comedy club next door.",

And the reason for not being a 4 or 5 stars rating is the price of the menu; I understand that it is a downtown bar and it is pricey but $9 for a short cheap whisky ( Jim bean ) and coke is very excessive in my opinion.",

We were served by the cutest little waitress - I believe her name was Tesha.   We were all served with a big smile and can do attitude. The food came out super quick and was tasty, huge portions. I ordered a short rib crust pizza which was really awesome, personally would have liked a little spice on it but otherwise the flavor was great.   Fun environment, lively live entertainment that was really fun and just easy. Again the server did an amazing job. Great spot.",

The resturant seating had live music. My guest and I sat on the patio. We had to wait 15mins before someone asked us what we wanted to drink. This resturant does not have the 2 min rule like most resturants do for a server to greet you. The surrounding tables had the same experience. The resturant was not to busy just not enough servers.  The menu is limited but has a great variety of options to choose from for all dietary needs. I am not a beer drinker but my guest who joined me was VERY impressed by all the different brands. I ordered the Sasuage, Peppers, and Tomato Jam Flatbread. It was good. My friend ordered the same thing but his came about 20 mins after mine did. The server knew we were not splitting the dish but for some reason it took forever to come out. What appeared to a be a manager dropped of his flatbread with no apology or sorry it took so long. We both enjoyed it! For a place that is not known as a pizza parlor I was truy impressed. All the food that walked by our table was nicely presented and looked really great. We will go back to try the other well priced options they offer. I will mention they validate parking for up to 3 hours which is nice. Parking is in the same building.",

The chicken was fresh and the chips hot and crispy.  The band was even better than the service (Is that possible??).  It was a great night.  I'm so glad we decided to spend our time and money at CB.  We will definitely go again the next time we want a guaranteed good time after attending a show in downtown Phoenix.  Super awesome!",

My girlfriend and I dined at this location during happy hour and we were welcomed by Anna who was our server. We ordered the steak nachos which seemed to be a well liked appetizer and it sure didn't disappoint. The nachos came out shortly after we ordered; about 10 minutes. The nachos were very delicious and the steak was cooked perfectly; although I wish the steak portion to nachos could've been more generous, I was still satisfied with the appetizer.  Anna was an outstanding server. She was very attentive and extremely courteous and professional. She was very thankful for our positive feedback about happy hour appetizer and overall restaurant experience. She was also the first waitress to ever state that she didn't mind being flagged down if we needed her. We definitely need more waitresses like her in the restaurant industry. Overall, we enjoyed our time and meal at this restaurant and will most definitely be returning as well as recommending this restaurant to others.",

For dinner we had the Ham and Cheese Gougeres, which were ok, a Scotch Egg, which was good and Pepperoni Pizza which was surprisingly really good.  The service was good, the bartender let us taste a bunch of things and made good suggestions so we could decide what we wanted.  The beer list here is awesome.

But she had this attitude and then when she brought the check she said she didn't charge me and I said thanks you didn't have to do that. And then she proceeded to talk to me like a child and remind me that bbq sauce only comes on the chicken and one other dish and not the ribs.

Best happy hour specials, both in price and beer selection....service is outstanding (and pretty easy on the eyes, not trying to sound too chauvinistic). Great place to settle in and enjoy a few before a show next door at Stand Up Live, food selection is \"sophisticated bar food\" (which is right up my alley); artisan pizza selection is to die for. Smoking patio you can drink on, which has my favorite view of Downtown Phoenix at Central and Washington. Great place to see a band, as their stage is right in the middle of their wraparound bar. Great place to start or end the night.",

    "text": "I would say this place is \"eh\".  Actually I tried to get my co-workers to leave after a few rounds but they seem to like to stay put whereas I would rather bounce around.  Biggest complaint...inconsistency.  My first waitress brought by Vodka Tonic with a nice little glass full of lemon and lime slices and the second waitress didn't.  Not a big deal, but you should get the same service from everyone.  The waitresses wear little tiny vests with not shirt underneath and their breasts popping out; so if that is your thing, you may like it hear (the men with me certainly did).  There was live music at 9:30 but it was advertised for 5:30 which is what we planned for so that was a bummer.  The pretzel appetizer was good, pizza was ok at best.  Overall, I wouldn't go back.",

If you are looking to go out with friends for a drink and a live band and don't care about conversation, this is a great place.  The set up is cool, the band plays behind the bar, but that makes it really hard to talk to the bartender. They have A LOT of beers on tap and I was impressed by their selection of local brews. They even had a few THAT Brewery beers which I can't recall seeing anywhere else.   Another good feature is that the kitchen is open late and the food is very good, it's much better then typical \"bar food.\"",

Maybe it's because it is a glimpse of what downtown Phoenix could be: a hot spot for the night life scene. CityScape offers a very real potential for revival of social activity in the heart of the city, and Copper Blues is off to a good start! My wife and I went on a Saturday night. We live right down the street, so we had to see if it was worth adding to our list of hangouts. The vibe was very casual, hip and festive. They offer around 50 beers on tap, some delicious small plates (and some larger ones), and live entertainment! That night we tried the Filet Bites, paired perfectly with a creamy horseradish sauce, and knocked back a few beers while enjoying a band playing some great covers! The prices were a bit higher than surrounding local bars, but it was well worth it to enjoy a more upbeat night in a NICE setting!",

I never really realized how big the inside the place was. They had live music, which was entertaining (nothing special). The band played a lot of popular older songs that are always a good time.   In the past, I would stop by here before a live comedy show or ball game, so, I haven't really given the place my full attention. It was always a shorter visit. This time, we were there the whole night and it was actually a lot of fun. I really commend them for their beer selection. They have a fairly large wall of different craft beers that are hard to find at other bars... especially in downtown (how sad is that).   I haven't really been a huge fan of the Downtown seen, but thanks to Copper Blues, my perception of Downtown has slightly increased. I know that I will def give Copper Blues another chance in the near future.  I had some 90-minute dogfish IPAs and some Firestone double IPAs and they were both hoppy and delicious!",

I ordered the house made chips to start. For my entree I ordered a Greek salad with no olives and grilled salmon. Twenty minutes later, the waitress returned to my table to tell me that the salad without the olives would be very plain, just greens. She made my original Greek salad order sound un-appetizing so I ordered one of the other salads on the menu. I'm not sure why not having olives in my salad would have ruined the entree? The other people in my party eventually received their food and finished it before I I had to call the waitress over and ask her what happened. She said something about the kitchen losing the ticket and that it should be right out. I waited a bit longer and called her over to cancel the order. My party was finished and ready to leave. I left without my food. Thank god I ordered the house made chips or I wouldn't have had any dinner. Horrible experience, I won't be returning.",

We arrived at about 1:45a and the server was bubbly and gladly took our drink orders. We received our drinks and enjoyed our tiny bit of time we had left. At about 1:55a the server was well aware of what time it was and was still very cool and asked if we wanted one more round before it was closing time so we said sure! We ordered 2 more beers and 7 shots. The shot wasn't complicated but when she brought them back they were wrong as far as appearance so we teased the server for a discount on them because the bartender clearly messed up. She laughed with us and said she was there watching him and at least knew it was the right ingredients. As we are sipping our drinks the manager rudely comes over and makes a passive-aggressive comment in regards to us still being in the establishment despite what time it was. He simply could have asked us if we would mind wrapping it up since it was closing time instead of being a jackass about it. After his snide comment the energy in the room was just dead. We were finishing our drinks and talking amongst each other about how rude he was and how as fellow bar industry employees we would NEVER talk to clients that way especially when our employee still chose to serve them before closing. This jerkoff decides to come back over to our table and butt in our conversation with more unnecessary commentary about Arizona laws and how they've been nice to us and this that and the other. Needless to say this manager shouldn't be a manager if he doesn't know how to speak to people without being passive aggressive and unprofessional. He was a complete ass and will I suggest to everyone to seek a beer bar elsewhere so they don't have to put up with such a pathetic individual and an overall RUDE person.",

    "text": "Food: quite delicious. Atmosphere: rockin'. Customer service? I'm disheartened to say that it's extremely disappointing! Therefore the three stars is only for the food and atmosphere. I've been to Copper Blues three times now and every time there's always been some sort of hiccup. However, the hiccups were short lived and soon forgotten. Unfortunately the hiccup during this last visit won't be so easily forgotten.   This past Friday night, we went to see Bob Saget perform (he is absolutely hilarious by the way). Before the show, we wanted to grab dinner so we decided to make it easy and eat at Copper Blues. When we arrived, we were given a buzzer and quoted for a 10-minute wait. We asked if there was open seating anywhere and they directed us to the outdoor patio and said that was the only open seating. After about 10 minutes of waiting, we checked back with the hostess on the status and at that point, she said it was going to be a 35 minute wait. We said that we were told 10 minutes initially and then she said, \"oh well, then it's 10 minutes I guess.\" It was all very confusing. So after about another 10 minutes, we checked back again and at this point they said that they never quote a wait time and when I told them that I had been quoted twice, she said again that they never quote a wait time. I felt like I was on crazy pills! It didnt seem like the staff knew what was going on that night! Well, the saga continues on...   At this point, it's around 6:00 PM and we are hungry and eager to get some dinner before Saget. It was also freezing on the outdoor patio and we were hoping to sit inside. We decide to check out the inside portion of the restaurant (even though we were told initially that the only open seating was outside). Well, when we got inside, we realized that the entire bar area was also open seating. Now this is where the hiccup will forever stay with me and it will be hard to get over this next part. We find two high top tables and are told that one is in use, so we take the other one. It has three chairs and we need two more chairs. At this point, a waiter comes up and confronts us. I let him know that we are in need of two more chairs and do they have any (this is in the open seating bar, remember.) He turns to me, stares at me dead on and says \"well are you even planning on eating here or are you just going to be using this table to wait?\" Now regardless of whether we were going to order one drink or a whole meal, I don't think a waiter should ever question a customer and treat them the way I was treated. I proceed to tell him that we are wanting to eat dinner and we have been wanting to eat dinner there for a good thirty minutes! I was blown away by the treatment and I will admit that I've never been treated so rudely at a restaurant before. Someone must have seen my anger and utter shock because about five minutes later they told us they found a table at the bar for us but sadly at that point, the experience at Copper Blues was ruined. We ordered several drinks and a couple appetizers (which were delicious) but after the treatment, decided to just eat dinner at Stand Up Live.   I hate writing a disappointing review like this one. I visit restaurants wanting a good experience and wanting to enjoy the atmosphere. However, customer service can either make or badly break an experience.",

We didnt have any issues getting our drinks even though the place was packed, but we had seats right at the bar. We got lucky. Cant wait to come here again with friends. The only warning is the drinks are not very cheap....to be expected from this type of place in its location. (We paid 10 bucks a pop for vodka sodas with titos) Very fun time!",

This was my first time but won't be my last!  When I liked about the bar so much was the cool strange that is behind the bartenders. Mad the center of attention of the bar focused on the band playing and it was a nice touch having all the taps of craft beer at the base of the stage. Speaking of craft beers, they have over 60 and they are great! Kinda like a live music Yard House.   We came here in a night of a Dbacks game. Bar was crowded but because there are 3 bars, and a dedicated area for smokers right outside the. Bar, I really didn't have to wait for a drink or find a place to stand and watch the band. Band was great. So how can I rate a place that has live music and craft beer anything lower than 4 stars.lol.  I didn't have any food, but I think I might have found my too go before Dbacks game or event downtown spot.",

The fries are seasoned very well and taste great by itself or with the Sriracha ranch sauce. They weren't quite as crispy as I would have liked, but for me, the seasoning made up for it. The Sriracha ranch added a nice spicy kick. I would definitely order this the next time I'm here.   Shrimp pizza: This was okay. The tomatoes were delightful. the dough was nice, and the sauce was savory. I just wish there was some more shrimp on the pizza and that the shrimp would taste fresher. Maybe it was just the few that I had, but the shrimp just didn't taste that fresh to me.  Atmosphere: I was here on a Friday night, and the place was pretty full. There was a live cover band inside, which I believe was air-conditioned. It was a fun place.",

Bellied up to the stage bar for a great view of the band and amazing beer selection, along with a pretty cool cocktail menu. Decided to stay on for the instant classics and wow! What a great time that was! We had so much fun dancing and singing and we had maybe a few too many drinks which leads me to the main reason I'm writing this review. We had a situation where we paid cash, and upon checking my bank account the next morning, they had accidentally charged my card for the full amount too. I called and spoke to Casey, the manager, and he checked into the situation and promptly called me back and told me that my card would me credited. I really appreciate the honesty and look forward to many more nights at copper blues! Thank you!",

    "text": "If I could only give this place 0 stars... Also people you might want to read my review and take it into consideration since I have been working in bars  and live music venues for over six years.   I will start with the place itself, which I think is pretty cool and I love the bands they invite there. Really good vibe, great selection of beers and liquor . That's the good side of it.   As for the service..nah. Some bartenders are great some are pretty bitchy with horrible attitude towards you for no reason. ( I was a bartender myself, I know I haven't done anything wrong to them)   And now l would like to share my story. One night me and my friend went to this place hoping to have a great time. As we approached the door guys, they asked us to showed them our id's, which was no problem since I am 26 and my friend is 32. I showed them brand new Arizona state drivers licence! (Brand new since I moved here from New York and had to change them). The door guy was looking at it for over one minute and said that he doesn't like my licence. No reasonable explanation. We asked to talk with a manager, whom I showed my other government issued id and he said that my licence say I am 6'2 but there is no way I am that tall. After rejecting both of my government issued Id's and telling me that is no good for a \"liquor law\" I had to leave.  What I call that.. is overuse of \"power\". You really don't need a lot of brain to be a bar manager  really, but that was something beyond stupid. We were totally sober, looking great, just wanted to listen to some live music but some manager, who probably had a miserable day or life decided that we can't have good time. No real reason beyond that.    Owners of that place did a great job with that place, but I would really advise on hiring a manager, who knows what he is doing and don't ruin good customer's impression on this place.  My company were considering to throw our corporate party in the place but now I won't let that happen.",

The crowd tends to be late 20's- 40's professional non obnoxious types.  I don't feel like I'm gonna get hit on by some creeper or my purse will be robbed.  I've been on karaoke Thursday which is super fun and also on sat with just a live band no karaoke.   My biggest grip is the service.  Our server was horrible.  We weren't sure if she was drunk/high/ or plain incompetent.  She would drop drinks off at our table- leave before we even had a chance to ask what/who's drinks were who's since we ordered from the cocktail menu.  We had no silverware and had to ask several times for napkins etc.   she never came by and asked if we were okay etc.  she took drinks away from the table without being finished , never checked if we were doing okay etc.  and we are not a high maintenance group of gals either. this is a trend I've been seeing lately- either people are being trained badly or they are allowed to get loaded on the job.  I would of given this place 5 stars but service really was lackluster.  It was at the point where we considered not leaving a tip.   Will be back cause I like the place but hope we get a decent waitress next time.",

    "text": "Two stars, but only because the food was good (when we finally got it). We went on the 4th to grab a few drinks and apps before the Diamonbacks game. The place was crowded, but we found a table right away. Our server was initially attentive, getting us water and taking our drink orders. It was happy hour (on a Saturday afternoon - bonus!) so AZ beers were $3 and appetizers were a few bucks off. We quickly placed our order for the chicken drumsticks and scotch egg, then later decided too add filet bites and Brussels sprouts.   About 30 minutes later, the chicken drumsticks came out. Quite a bit of a wait for chicken, but they were busy and the chicken was tasty so we were happy. Now about 45 minutes into our dining experience, the filet bites came out. No biggie, we added them after our initial order. They were good - nothing to write home about, but good.   As we conversed, listened to the live music, and drank our beers, I politely asked our server if our other snacks were coming. \"The kitchen is really backed up, but I'll check on them,\" she said. Meanwhile, tables who arrived after we did were finishing full meals. Our server had clearly forgotten the rest of our order and was quick to pass the blame.   Now about 70 minutes into our visit, out come the Brussels sprouts. Meh. I make them better at home. Plus the balsamic and butternut squash with the char of the sprouts and parmesan was just a weird combination.   Now we need to hurry it up and bear the nasty heat to make it to the game on time. Thinking I could flag our server down to remove the scotch egg from our bill, she was of course no where to be found. We are now about 90 minutes into our visit and out comes the golden, err, scotch egg. Delicious! We scarfed it down and were able to get our check (finally). When it came, however, our server had charged us full price for the sprouts and egg. Another clear indication that she forgot them.   Bill is settled, we are on our way, and now are late for the game. We missed the first inning AND the national anthem on the Fourth of July!   I know this is a long review to say we had shitty service, but I did want to point out the positive notes. In summary, nearly 2 hours to get some beers and appetizers without dilly dallying with our orders is a little excessive. I get it when things are hopping and busy, but having your server lie to you about dropping the ball on your order and then overcharging you while trying to pass it off is totally UNACCEPTABLE. I won't be back to dine before any sporting events or comedy shows. There are too many other restaurants with good service that are more deserving of my hard earned dough.",

They have a huge beer selection and the drinks are pretty tasty. They are a bit pricey though.  They always have live music and the band plays above the main bar and it's really cool looking. I'd say this bar is less dancey and more chill at a bar stool/table etc.   The only other real downside, other than the price is that it tends to be a real taco fest, so if you're a single lady that can be disappointing.  Everything is clean and elegant. It is a bit more upscale than most bars around there, but you will fit in wearing jeans and a t-shirt or a dress with heels. It is a little less hipster full than the usual too so I enjoy it when I'm sick of the hipster scene at lost leaf.",

It was a Thursday night after the Arizona State Fair and it was a karaoke night.  So much fun seeing regular Joe's and Jane's getting called up to perform their favorite songs with a live band.  We were able to get a long table for the eight of us.  Great food - pizza, wings, hummus, spinach dip, quesadilla, burgers, etc.  Quick and friendly service.  Clean restrooms.   Top notch entertainment venue in the downtown area.  We especially loved how the windows opened up and the sound carried out into the city.  Great views of some historic downtown buildings also.  We will definitely be back.",

But this place has them... and honestly speaking it was (almost) worth drinking the kool-aid for! I completely am on the Impossible bandwagon like it was amazing! Now my friend ordered the mac n cheese and.....it was not so good (insert sad face emoji here ____) it was okay when warm but after it cooled it was like cement, it was one step above box and only because they garnished the top...(lol) but all in all this was a nice space perfect for a Monday date night!",

Cool, then asked about the Chinese chicken salad, is it pulled, hot/cold she didn't seem to know so she entertained us with a lousy guess. Salad came and it was opposed as to what the server guessed. When we brought it to her attention, she didn't seemed concerned.   Nice place and environment, staff could use better training. Seemed like nobody really had a answer.

We sat in the outdoor seating area which has a view of the courtyard of the Phoenix CityScape area.   We ordered a couple of local IPAs (which were $4 during happy hour). We enjoyed listening to the 90's music and watching the security staff of the comedy club next door getting ready for the show that night. Who knew Daryl from The Office would need 8 security guards at his show?  We weren't planning on ordering food, but the people at the table next to ours ordered several appetizers and they all looked really tasty. In the end, we opted for the soft pretzels which came with beer cheese as a dipping sauce. They were just as good as they look in the picture I am including with this review.   Overall, Copper Blues has a really great happy hour with wonderful deals, tasty food, and a lively atmosphere. We would definitely come back.",

I Made note to the bartender about it she told us she would make us another round with \"less sugar\" it never came. When it came to our food it took over 1hr  to make it to the table our server checked in once on the way to running food to another table that our food \"was on the way\" only after she seen me approach the bartender. Food came out great presentation, but timing for a set of nachos and grilled cheese could be improved. With my situational awareness goggles, I looked around to show some sympathy to see how busy they were max 20 tables most drinking not eating it, which is why im upset. Advice from a fellow partner in the industry if someone seems upset grab manager its less about the buck but the service you provide. Would not recommend planning for a \"good time\" here other than maybe having beer.",

It's a nice bar, albeit a bit pricey and their claim to fame is having hundreda of beer taps! I tried counting them all, but stopped at around 50.  The place has a rather nice decor. When I went all the staff were dressed as Elves and other Christmas related things as a sort of \"Christmas in July\" during the summer. They were friendly and got us a seat within seconds of us arriving even though the place was packed. For those interested (ie: you perverts out there), the waitresses here seem to dress in skimpy outfits here that show off their cleavage ;-)  We waited for a bit before waitress came back to get our orders and this seemed to be a common theme throughout the night, but she came around just before we were about to get up and find someone everytime. I got the ribs, my colleagues had pizza, wings, and a burger. Of course we put a few drinks down the hatch as well. The food took awhile took maybe 20-30 minutes to come out, they warned us beforehand it might be awhile. When it did come, everything was cooked to perfection. The ribs weren't fall off the bone, but they were good nonetheless.  There was a live band playing too although you could barely make out the vocals over the crowd noise. My only big gripe is they sat us in high chairs when there were booths and other tables available...although these seemed more comfortable than the usual ones.   Next time I'm in Arizona I'll make sure to stop by and try out this place again.  4 out of 5 stars",

I had a Copper Blues Burger, wife had a Steak Salad, The food was great! Waitress, Amy, was cute, had her boobs pushed up to her neck. Which I kinda like. She spaced out a couple of times forgetting to get a drink, but quickly remembered, apologized and had a great smile. Which makes it up for me. I used to bar-tend and I'm pretty forgiving. And I like boobs. ;)      The music ended up not being that loud. Zimi was playing. We are 50, so it was mostly classic rock. They were okay. We planned on moving into the bar area until we got the bill. What burnt me was the drink price. $10 for a Jack n 7.  The drinks were pretty weak, not much ice so they tasted watered down. So we decided to leave. Ended up sitting in the parking garage for 25 mins. with a bunch of grumpy people that had seen Dana Carvey at Stand Up Live that just got out. He must not of been that funny.",

I never met a beer I didn't like.)  Warning! The entire bar area is first come, first serve seating. So pony up soon! Those seats fill fast.   Happy Hour makes everyone happy. Right? But before a DBacks game you can score big! M-F, 3-6pm make everyone happy! (Have no fear, weekends happiness abounds. Just 4-6pm.)  $3 Pints (Domestic & Local) $4 Pints (Crafts) $5 Call Cocktails  $3 House Wines  I initially offered a $1 beer shot. THEN I learned it was a way to explore different types of beer. Cool-i-o.   They also have a neat set of specialty drink on special called Rocktails and Rocktinis. They looked beautiful, but for another time. I'm a BEER drinker!  With beer, you (meaning, I) had to indulge with the following: - \"Pub Chips\" are actually potato chips layered w/blue cheese & hot sauce. You haven't drank a beer until you've tried this. Seriously. So simple and oh so good.   - Fried shrimp = We shared, otherwise I might have licked all the mayonnaise stuff. (Did I just say that out loud? ;)  Oh, before I forget! The servers in their trendy little vests were a hoot! Both times! Great service. Seems like a neat place to catch live music. It's on my list to try again on a non-game day, perhaps before a comedy show.   Thx Copper Blues!",

That would never be an option we would find out 3-4 songs into a drunk ex-marines shit-show of \"music\"...my god he sucks, isn't a musician and over achieved by getting this gig!! Well, we sat at the bar. Maybe a bad choice, bartenders weren't very friendly (no smiles)...the kegs were blowing on their beers so I got half a glass of the beer I ordered and chose something else. . . French fries were cleared from my seat without asking /before I had finished them...maybe just because we ordered another basket, but we really weren't done.... Also, the beer lines are too warm here, poorly designed their bar...they have foam for days, and the girls behind the bar have absolutely no idea how to pour a beer. They are literally fucking the spigot with the beer glass, dipping beer and spigot - this is totally unsanitary!!! and likely they chip a lot of their glassware with this bad habit. They also cannot keep up on their dishes, serving warm glasses with their foamed beer...  okay, lastly... the music. what. a. shit. show. they have NO IDEA who or how to hire musicians. Out of tune, out of rhythm (terrible musicians), out of phase (terrible sound techs), and cringeworthy song choices... the open mic disaster at copper blues may be every tuesday, go for 'uncomfortable listening hour' and get terrible service by 'attractive' people... Owners need to rethink their strategy for such a high volume/value location, their investment is going to tank at this rate!!! won't be returning, seriously advise against this place...",

You can get close to the band at the bar and see all the action but fair warning, it's pretty loud at front. The space is large and accommodating for parties of all sizes and the bar and wait staff are attentive despite the seeming chaos of a music venue/restaurant.  The beer selection is very extensive and offers something for everyone, even Belgium triples. I did eat any food but I'll update my review the next time I head over there. If you're looking for some fun on a Tuesday, Copper Blues is a great way to kick off your night.",

And I'm so happy we did. Went and grabbed drinks with an old buddy and the music was on point, the food was perfect and the drinks were as fantastic as the bartender who made them (and he was pretty fantastic)   The fries and the chicken wings were crispy!!! Like perfect crispy without being burnt or too greasy.   The drinks!! Omg the drinks!!!! I got me this vodka drink...it was the second one down on the specialties but I forgot the name. But it was so mouthwatering!!! And the pomegranate margarita my buddy had!?!? I never had a Pom one before and it was heaven.   I always stare at this bar when working out at EoS across the street and I'm so glad I finally went in to truly enjoy the experience (cause let's face it when you go to a bar for a show it's no where like how it is on a regular day)",

One of the bars/restaurants under Copper Blues was having open interviews and in my Irish Whiskey style I drunkenly stumbled over to the table, sat down and started talking to the dude that was sitting there. I'm sure I was obnoxious, no- I take that back- I was obnoxious. He asked if we were headed to Copper Blues and I laughed and proceeded to tell him it's a douche bar. He sent us upstairs and had us drop his name and treated us to an appetizer and a few sodas to sober us up a bit. (Don't worry- we took an Uber) My mind wasn't changed at that moment but it was a great impression. What he didn't tell us was that he's the owner, we found out through the waitress.   A few more events came up and I always accepted the invitations and my mind slowly began to change. I have to say that now this is my all time favorite bar. No fighting, no one getting punched in the face, everyone is out to have a good time, music is great, food is good, and everyone there is just happy. The service is amazing- considering the place is always packed and even the bathrooms are nice and clean! We even paid to spend NYE there, and IMO it was the best one we've had in years.   We live in Ahwatukee so it's a pricey Uber/Lyft but it's worth it. Sorry to the owner, I was wrong- it really is a great bar.",

I order \"I get around\" from the drink menu but the server gave me my coworkers drink instead which had a grapefruit taste. The drink was very watered down and not that strong. I ordered the buffalo crispy copper wings and a basket of fries. The baskets of fries was actually a lot. I didn't even finish the whole basket even after sharing. The wings were okay. Didn't really meet my expectations. The homemade blue cheese dressing tasted a little weird and I did not like it. Overall the food was a little disappointing. I didn't finish my wings but I didn't want to take them home with me. Also, they were suppose to have karaoke at 9pm but we ended up not staying.",

They have an AMAZING craft beer selection on tap and by the bottle. Many specials on mixed drinks as well.   Staffed successfully. In the area we were seated, there was about 5-6 servers. We were greeted and waited on by two waitresses both were pleasant & professional. Very impressive!

    "text": "Truth be told I am reviewing the experience and drinks more so than any food or other fare from the kitchen. My party of six were leaving a team building night at Lucky Strike, when on our way to the garage we heard music coming from Copper Blues. At first we figured we were walking into a Thursday night late karaoke which was somewhat accurate. Instead we were met with the site of not a screen with cheesy music being pumped in, but rather a full 5 piece live band who were incredible in their playing ability! To watch people sing with a live band instead of dancing words raised the bar for the performances and they did not disappoint.   Our waitress Tiami was just as amazing. I watched her maneuver through her many tables while still being able to chat up our table and other customers proving to be very friendly and efficient since she got our orders and drinks out very quickly considering how crowded it was (which is a testament to the bar backs too!) If I was a manager at this place I would not only promote Tiami, but give her a raise, and put her in charge of training as we watched her effortlessly tend to her customers that she treated like personal friends.   Our drinks were fantastic and their selection on tap exceeded our beer drinkers taste pallets (which Tiami deserves another shout out for)! We listened, laughed, told stories connected to songs we were hearing, and were in awe of the many many talented singers...to talented in fact. This is NOT some cruise ship - dive bar karaoke. The performers on this stage could REALLY sing which made all of us chicken out song after song by saying, \"I don't want to follow that!!!\"   At the end of the day, we ALL said we'd be coming back and next time we will skip Lucky Strike and go straight to Copper Blues! Incredible night!",

I had a Good Vibrations and a something-Tree (cocktails all have song names). Both were fruitier spins on classics- an old fashioned and a mojito. The kiwi-infused mojito was my favorite. After seeing the happy hour prices, I'll be back for another.  I had been craving some chocolate-y dessert since my disappointing pasty earlier in the night and the skillet cookie was amazing. If you like your cookies closer to warm, gooey dough, it's perfection. And it's much too much for one person!  Service was ok- not great, not awful. It was too loud to hear anything most of the time, and I liked the music volume a lot better when the band wasn't playing. I had hoped for dancing, but even on a late Saturday night, there wasn't really any going on. Maybe another time.",

I ordered the nachos with chicken. Other people in my party ordered the bacon burger, wings, turkey sandwich, and fries. The nachos are amazingggg and HUGE. Definitely a shareable appetizer/meal. My brother said the burger was okay, the wings were good, and the turkey sandwich is huge and really good! The ambience is nice, it definitely gets loud though since they play music and sometimes live music since it's more of a bar.",

Is this a bar or restaurant? We had a wonderful server by the name of Chris, he was very out going and was rather flattering. Chris suggested the Spinach pizza; which was phenomenal (must try!). Although there is a little wait if you are ordering beers from the server. The bartender was quicker but seem a little flustered and didn't have the same bubbly personality as our server my wife noticed. So our server made up for the wait with his service and smile.  Good place, great drink selection, small food menu (reason for 4 stars), wonderful service!",

Our waitress was nice but inattentive.  It took a long time to order.  Upwards of 40 minutes.  We ordered the pretzels, Mac and cheese, and the bbq pizza.  The pretzel sticks were so chewy there was no way they were not reheated from hours earlier, I could barely bite pieces off.  The cheese dip that came with them was the only redeeming part.  The Mac and cheese tasted like metal, as if it had been sitting in that cast iron pan all weekend before it was cooked, and they left off the chip topping that was described in the menu. Also, we got the wrong pizza.  The pizza we had was okay, don't know what it was- something with pepperoni and sausage.  I realize we didn't come during prime food hours, but still.  I'm usually the least picky restaurant person at the table, and I thought everything from service to food was pretty bad.  We will never, ever go back.",

The crowd is clearly a late 20's-early 30's bunch and I am old enough to be their father.  The \"hip\" mohawked bar keep must not see be able to see anyone who doesn't meet his age standards.  Look, I would have served the cute girl standing to me first too - but after that - come on.  My money must be covered in shit, because he just wasn't going to touch it.

This place is a great place to come in cityscape (downtown phoenix) it seems packed every time we go there and is always a fun place. The live music is great, and most do cover music from anything to adele, mumford and sons, lmfao, and even black eyed peas. Its pretty neat. After the live band they have a live dj. There is indoor and outdoor seating. HOwever in the summer I DO NOT recommend sitting outdoors. Its a weird enclosed patio that has half open windows. They have ceiling fans but its hotter than the temperature outside really is, maybe it traps the heat in. Anyway, dont sit out side. Plus the servers outside suck pretty bad. On Friday night, or server managed to not get one of the drinks for our party, never get us water, and really never show up to get our other orders. But when we did find her and ask her for drinks she seemed happy to oblige. We had a group of 8 and perhaps it was overwhelming for her.  Anyway, they have some fun/different beers too. The top choices of my gf are the blueberry beer and there is another beer with a hint of watermelon. They have great porters and hefes as well. Lots of local beers, but I dont see many specials/deals for them in particular. The prices range from $5-7 for a pint.",

Depending on the night there will either be a live band or dj; both are nice and don't stray too far from the mainstream. What this means is the dj isn't gonna play some tracks that sound like cats farting into a microphone. Check out Copper Blues, especially if you're leaving a show at Stand Up Live.",

It took over an hour to get our food and when the waitress brought it, it was wrong.  My husband asked 3 different people for more water, and all that happened was that our airhead waitress took his empty glass away.  What?  I hoped that they would have had their act together a little better considering their proximity to USAC, Chase and Comerica.  I will say that the various servers were friendly and polite, I just didn't understand why we were ignored so badly.  I can't really comment in detail on the food, since all we wound up eating was a side Caesar salad and an order of the filet bites.  I wasn't a huge fan of the filet bites, it was more like overcooked carne asada than what I was expecting.",

My wife and I enjoy sampling unique beers. And enjoy their selection. We usually gravitate towards the sexy strongs like Left Coast Asylum, or Chimay.  The waitresses and bartenders are usually very nice and attractive. My wife and I enjoy sitting in the outdoor area. Later in the evening, around nine o'clock they usually have a live band. I'm usually gone by then, as it is hard to have a conversation. The weekends can get really packed. Especially late at night.  Whether the place is packed or not there's always plenty of good people watching. There is a decent after work crowd during the week as well.  The wings are good, the taco appetizers good, their pizzas are good, and the burgers are good. I've not had anything else.",

    "text": "My husband and I snuck a rare evening out recently and hit a few new places downtown.  I'm not sure if I really loved this place or if I really just loved in comparison to the Titled Kilt, but I do highly recommend it.  They have an amazing selection of beers, many local.  The decor is awesome (the stage is the coolest I've ever seen in any bar or club BTW), and the staff is uber friendly (ok, possibly a little too perky and geared toward impressing the male customers but that may have just been a passing thing).  There are also some lovely beer cocktails and a great list of specialty cocktails.  The menu is great but I definitely get the sense they're cooking in a very chain/production kind of mode.  Hard to explain, but I didn't feel any degree of individual care or craft in the food.  Nonetheless, it's decent.  I was a little surprised about the wine list, but it's very telling about what this bar aspires to be.  Very few wines are available (and the list is not creative or interesting in any way), but either 6 or 7 types of champagne, including both Dom and Cristal by the bottle (at $600 and $700 or so, respectively).  Really?  Anyway, I'm hoping Copper Blues gets in some good local music to grace that awesome stage, and that they try to keep it real rather than trying to force some kind of poseur scene club atmosphere (we already have a couple of those...).",

When Tits McGee our waitress came by and brought us our 2nd round of beers she was flirting with two drunk guys and after that she said she will check on our meal but after 45mins I were wondering if she was gone. We finally asked for a manager because it was now 7:15 and no food and no idea if it was even close to being done. We debated on leaving but the girls I was with were starving so we stayed. Manager came back offered us chips and salsa and paid for our drinks because the kitchen was backed up and he said that he wouldn't be able to get our food down here in 15 mins. I'm thinking Tits McGee forgot to put in our order. I have a groupon for this place and I can never ever seem to use it, this is the 3rd time I've tried!!! Bummer! Anyways manager offered to fix our next visit and have us his cards. I will def get in contact and see if he can fix this previous visit.",

For dinner I ordered the flat bread with Goat cheese, fig and honey. It was super tasty, but a little too sweet for dinner. When we left the comedy show I ran in to use the restroom, and there was a live band playing. They sounded great and the guests looked like they were having a good time, made me want to go back.

There is no set dance floor so expect myself and others to be dancing around your table.  Some nights there are some really great bands playing and others have the bands that play the Vegas style top 40 mash ups that I find a little strange. The staff are super friendly and know how to mix a drink.  I can always count on Willis to serve my vodkas up right.  Not too stiff, not too weak.  A great bartender that always adds to our fun time. The location is fantastic.  The sister to Stand Up live, across from Lucky Strike, on the second floor of CityScape, so the view on the patio of downtown at night is a winner. I haven't ate here yet, but if the food is the same as they serve at Stand Up Live, it's pretty tasty bar fair. It's a great choice if you're looking for a fun time downtown.

The food's typical bar fare, but not bad for that, and suffices reasonably for the venue.  The ambiance is excellent (consistent with the venue again) with an excellent location and situation (upstairs, windows, central venue...with several other entertainment businesses right by).  The cover bands have been very good and the crowds 'fun'.  I have been on several occasions,    drop by fairly regularly,  and consider it the 'go to'  local joint for the casual drink or two and a listen....or a brew and a nosh....  Recommended for the 'drinks and music' deal, for sure.  A special experience would depend on the circumstances, but for a decent and honest set-up, Copper Blues provides an excellent and consistent product.  Service can be inconsistent, but in my experience it's varied from fair to excellent...hey guys...it's a busy urban bar scene...don't be so farkin' 'precious'!

I am little stuck in my kanye ways but they have a good choice for a wider audience . bands are multi genre talented. Also bartenders are lookers so watch your eyes if you are bringing your girl. I would recommend this bar if you have some friends in town , plenty of room , and you can sit back and just relax. O and nice bathrooms very nice. My only negative is , I had to ask if they validate parking . parking in down town phx is expense and not easy. They do validate parking for a public lot across the street but it would of just been nice to have that be a general question.

It was a group of 7, including myself and there was one other group of roughly 5 or 6 people on the other side of the room, other than that, the restaurant was fairly empty. The waitress that helped us was nice and courteous, however, when it came down to getting our food, its where it got interesting. First, about 45 minutes after we had ordered, 2 meals made it to the table. 15 minutes after that, 3 more people got their food. 5 minutes after that, the waiter comes back saying that she had submitted the ticket with all the meals but there was a confusion in the kitchen because of another large group they were cooking for at the same time. She apologized profusely and said they would cook those last 2 plates that never arrived. So, two of us (one being the birthday girl) NEVER received our food and had to get it in a box to go. 20 minutes later, she brought the food in boxes and comped the two meals. This is after we waited and waited awkwardly while the rest of the group ate. After we got the food she went back and took another 15 minutes to bring the check, and when she came back she said the bartender was supposed to get it to us, however, the bartender was never in sight.",

We went here as a group after dinner because we wanted to experience something else besides the usual Scottsdale and I I was hooked since the moment I walked in. It was a Friday night and The Instant Classics Band was playing that night. Amazing voices, music, and show! I know some other reviews say that Copper Blues compares to Blue Martini, yes I agree, except that it is more casual and I can testify that the live bands are waaaayyyy better along with the prices. Let's just say I danced all the way until they closed. The band stopped playing around 1 am I believe ( I had a few cocktails so that statement may not be fully True) and then they just played 90s and top 40s. I highly recommend this place. It is in Downtown Phoenix, very nice, chic, affordable, and FUN, FUN, FUN!! Perfect for going out with friends and have a lovely time!!! Now, if you are like me that looooooves to dance non-stopping and your date is not really a fan of dancing, this is still perfect. Because you can eat, have a beer or cocktail,  sit if you want to, dance your butt off, sit down again, go outside and have a ciggie, go back and have a tequila shot, dance again, another shot, and FLOOR! Just kidding!! you get my point! All you need is here =)",

My beer was empty twice--and I had to ask for the second beer--bartender did ask when my second was almost empty. Waited almost 30 minutes for a to-go dessert--doughnut bread pudding. Bartender didn't seem to care. I left an average tip. But came in willing to leave a LARGE tip because of the weekend I had. Left less than happy--could've been over whelmed with just a little extra effort.  At one point a manager jumped behind the bar to help \"Kyle\". She seemed to get \"it\".

As residents, we believed they would honor this agreement but after multiple visits, its managers and its waitresses have rejected the discount existed and worse, have claimed the discount no longer exists. Last month, after we attended a comedy show at StandUp Live, we went next door to Copper Blues for water and food.  The waitress told us the kitchen was closed when it wasn't and became angry when we insisted on simply having water.  She immediately ran to her manager and told him we weren't buying alcohol, then he had us kicked out. For asking for water.  This establishment is run by trash and they will make you sorry you ever spent a dollar on it.  We've concluded both its management and its ownership has deliberately lied to us about offering CityScape residents discounts. Thus, this is a dishonest establishment unworthy of any positive reviews based on quality service or professionalism.  Save your money, go somewhere else.",

I had a beer spilled on me by a guy who was clearly wasted and the bar continued to serve him and his friends who were belligerent...another guy paid for my food after his friend spilled his beer all over. That was very kind of him I suppose. They told an older gentleman, who was standing at the bar talking to me, that he needed to move out of \"our area\" and when the man told the bartender she just smiled. I don't know where security was and how people get away with this crap but I will never go to this place again. I feel bad for the downtown Phoenix. They just can't get it together and attract a better caliber of people.",

The food was very good, I ordered the small order of chicken nachos and it could have fed a table of 5. Live music and an atmosphere that is conducive for having a loud good time. I don't go to many loud drinking places but this one was loads of fun and I can totally see why folks would go there and enjoy every minute. Although I will not be a regular (not a regular anywhere), I will go back as I had such a good time.",

When I brought my friend along to jump on the mic singing CeeLo Green (all songs uncensored, because this is for fucking grown ups!), the audience went wild and he disappeared to presumably walk around giving everyone hi-fives.   This is a good beer bar, in which you'll pay reasonable prices from the draught selection. It's an eclectic mix of brews that will please lovers of any genre, whether it's a hefe or a porter. The porters and IPAs are awesome here. Just be wary of ordering something a bit off the beaten path. My Dogfish Head 90 Minute seemed more than a bit flat.   The outside bar is where I prefer to sit, even if it's exposed to the brutal Phoenician summer nights. The inside is always packed...absolutely full when I enter, and it's not really clear how to maneuver myself to order a beer on the inside. Especially with live drums going on full blast and almost nonstop behind the taps. Awkward.  Overall, I'll be back many times to say \"cheers!\" and laugh with my pals. It's easily the most fun I've had in Cityscape.",

I truly think they count them out, \"8 fries per plate\". I don't think it would be so bad if fries weren't provided at an additional cost.  It's considered an \"upgrade\" to your meal, they are at an additional cost.  If you're really  hungry or thirsty, then prepare to starve and dehydrate because the wait staff takes AT LEAST 3-5 mins before acknowledging the fact that you've sat at a table, despite the fact that someone has walked past you a couple of times. I can't tell if they're prejudice or just suck! I have a love hate relationship with this place. Keep up the good job with your food but please have meetings with and/or change your wait staff to those who care about the patrons who come to enjoy food, drinks and live music! I hope to get the attn of the manager or owner with this review!",

I then asked one of the bartenders right in front of me \"Hi, when you get a chance can you please get me a...\" she then interrupted me and told me \" everybody else here is before you wait your turn.\" I was speechless, I have never had any bartender say that to me. So we walked to the other bar by the stage and I was able to get a bartender's attention, I said my order to her and she didn't hear me. I repeated it two more times and she didn't lean any closer to hear me she actually back up a little. Bottom line I doubt I'll ever return due to poor customer service.

If you grab a seat at the bar, you will get better service and the bar tenders usually take some time to help you make a selection.  Having tried several items on the menu, the Chicken Nachos are the best!  It can feed 2-3 easily. The Brussels sprouts are also very good and so are the fries.  The Hummus was flavorless but came with great pita.  I would not recommend the pizza, every time we order it, the crust is soggy.  They have also recently changed their menu and added several items including mini appetizers. We tried the Ham and Cheese Gougers (?) on our last visit and were disappointing.  $5 for 5 small, dry biscuits with a few chunks of ham just isn't worth it.  They need to be stuffed with cheese or have a sauce.  Service is hit or miss.  This last time, we had to constantly ask for our orders.  Our waitress would bring 1/2 the order then ask if we needed anything else (uh, yes...the rest of our first order?)  After finally getting our food, we she was no where to be found for more drinks or the check.",

We came 2 hours before we had to be at the venue, so about 2 1/2 hours before the show started, and quickly found seats at the bar. We ordered a couple drinks and some food, accepting that it may be some time before our food comes out. 1 out of 4 dishes comes out after about 45 minutes however, nothing else did. The bartender was very sympathetic and kept sending people to check on our food. Given the bartender could not leave the bar, we knew that and did not expect that, however no one ever came. We sat the full two hours, with no update on our food. Eventually we gave up. We paid for the one meal and drinks we got, and ended up just getting hot dogs at the concession stand in the venue.   Typically I never leave one star, being in the restaurant industry I understand crazy circumstances. Sometimes it's just sooooo busy, however for no one to check on us, especially a manager to apology or discuss what was going on, I am very disappointed. We had no issues paying for the sandwich and drinks, however in all the restaurants I've worked for, this never would have been acceptable. Again, our server was very sympathetic. And I hope my experience perhaps is the outlier, and extremely out of the ordinary!  Here's hoping others had and continue to have a much better experience than I did, cheers!",

The bartenders were really nice but the table servers were a bit impatient. The beers were pretty reasonable but some were a costly.

I am happy to say that we had a great experience at Copper Blues and that we have no complaints. Well, their prices are a little high, but we expected this based on the location. That is a minor quibble.  Although they were moderately busy when we arrived (4:30pm on a Friday), we were seated promptly in the bar area. It was very loud since there was a two-man band playing, but they were good so it wasn't a big deal.   The beer selection was good... a little bit of everything. G. and I are both beer lovers so this made us happy campers.  I ordered the macaroni and cheese with bacon appetizer and G. ordered the hot wings. The macaroni and cheese was tasty... not the best I've ever had, but it was good and filling. My husband liked the wings although he said they weren't that hot. I tried one and I thought it was plenty hot, but I am a bit of a wuss so there you go.  Our server was excellent. She visited our table often enough to make sure we had drinks and didn't need anything, but not enough to be a bother. She was very friendly and knowledgeable about their menu.   If we didn't live so far away, we'd probably visit again soon. If we go to StandUp Live again, we'll definitely stop in for beers and dinner beforehand.",

Now we would get seated and no one would show up until 10 minutes past by the same when ordering our food.  Okay the change. Chad a manager at cb reached me on here about the experience. He invite me and bf as his guest to come back and get a better experience. I felt bad because i didnt want to seem like a crazy whining bitch but we went back and it was way different. Our waitress was amazing she was on her serving game. The food was amazing like always. There food is really good! The waitress asked me what happen last time and i told her about the crappy waitresses. I guess they got fired because i didn't see any of the old ones. I thanked chad for the night. He made our experience much better than before. It takes guts to invite an unhappy customer back but he did it and that's management.",

I was sitting on the patio at an isolated table with only about 5 other tables being serviced and no one inside, and I left realizing I forgot my sunglasses on the table. I called within 20 minutes to see if they had put them aside and the woman who answered the phone said, \"nope, we didn't find any sunglasses\". I asked her to please check again and she came back to the phone saying she asked the entire staff and no sunglasses were found. This is disconcerting, because she didn't even care to ask for my name and number in case something was to show up. These were Oliver People sunglasses so they don't come cheap, and they are my favorite. I'm sorry, but a staff member had to have picked them up! What a huge disappointment with this establishment.",

    "text": "Copper Blues could become one of the valley's hottest clubs. I couldn't give it a five star however, because there are some annoying negatives.  The environment is very impressive. Inside it is posh with expensive looking furniture, and there is plenty of room. An outside area gives impressive views of downtown Phoenix.  The selection of craft draft beers is extensive. Some of them are hard to find ales like Dogfish 90.   Wednesday night there are free dance lessons with no cover charge. After the lesson a live band plays. Dance lessons are from lindy hop guru Steve Conrad, who is teaching \"blues dance\". Blues dancing is an intimate style of dance that hasn't caught on in the Phoenix area, but will be popular when people find out about it.  Unfortunately getting to the club is frustrating. It's somewhat hard to find because it's on the second floor of a building. Parking underground is free but it's always full, so get used to the idea that you are going to fight for parking with Suns fans and other multitudes downtown. Expect to do a lot of walking if you intend on avoiding paid parking lots.  Dancing is problematic because there is no dance floor. For the lessons tables and chairs are cleared to reveal a nice wood floor. Usually you have to dance between tables. Considering that millions were spent to build this place it's incomprehensible that an expensive wood floor was installed without putting in an area that people can use to dance.  A band called the \"Sugar Thieves\" played the live music after the dance lesson. Unfortunately their music was far too fast for blues dancing (which is usually danced to very slow and sleazy blues or slow soul music) and was too fast for almost any dancing besides Lindy Hop. They are good musicians but obviously don't have a clue what kind of music dancers need to have fun.  To add the to the problems the live band is on a stage behind the bar. The distance to the band is makes the live music experience somewhat impersonal. Even worse, to order drinks you have to yell across the bar loud enough to be heard by the staff who are standing directly in front of the band. What a lousy floor plan!  Beers are expensive and yet the pints seem small because there is too much foam. The waitresses are cute but they don't know how to pour beer. Tsk! Tsk!",

We went to Hooters later up the street and there is no comparison - Copper Blue wins hands down for food, ambience and the view.",

    "text": "The boy and I finally check this place out last night.  It was everything I imagined it to be. Great view from the semi-outdoors bar area, lots of beers on tap, and nice patio area. It was a Monday night so they weren't very busy, which was nice, I wasn't in the mood for a crowed.   When checking out their menu online I saw they have my favorite beer on tap, SeaDog Wild Blueberry. It was delicious! Completely different on draft, but yummy all the same. They also had an Apple Cider on draft, my pick over a pear cider any day, that I could have in my Black Velvet (cider and Guinness). I was a happy camper.   Only downer was that they closed a bit earlier than we would have liked, but no worries we will just have to come back again soon to try some more beers.   The bartender was great, she let us try anything we wanted before committing to a full on pint. I tried to get the boy to be adventurous, but he stuck with the Stella, not bad at all, just a little boring. Oh well ;-)  I am looking forward to checking out Stand-Up Live soon as well, and the live bands they have at Copper Blue. I also hear they ahve a pretty awesome Ladies night on Thursdays, saweet! Menty menty more trips in my future, I can just see it. :-)",

FINALLY received the BEST service by Becca, she had a great attitude, full of smiles, she was very helpful and attentive, super cute blondie.  I will go back solely bc of this badass band and the possibility of working with Becca again :) I was so happy because the service is never ever ever good here, honestly the place usually sucks and we constantly ask ourselves why we end up here...it sounds attractive when you consider location and entertainment, but its a total buzz kill when you show up, the severs usually take forever, they are always miserable, the bar is out of your top 3 beers, the food is cold and sucks, and you're probably a good $70 bucks out. Hope you catch them on a really really good night, good luck!",

The hostess was very nice and seated us right away (they were not too busy on a Sunday afternoon, although that changed pretty quickly after we were seated).  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  The menu of food paled in comparison to the beer menu, but I didn't mind that a bit.    We started with the Spinach & Artichoke dip, which was heavenly.  Next time, I'm ordering the bacon appetizer.  Yup, just a side of bacon... makes me giddy.  I had the Copper Burger and my friend had the Cuban.  Both were delicious.  I would definitely make the trip back to try more beer!  OH!  Beer... we had the watermelon ale.  Amazing.  I believe they do $1 beer shots, possibly on Mondays, my memory is failing.  What a great way to try a ton of beers.",

They even carry Red Bridge in the bottle, which is great for us Gluten-Free'ers! There are cover bands every Wednesday, Friday and Saturday night, and you never quite know what you're going to get!   The food is amazing! If you're a mac 'n cheese fan, you would be amiss not to experience this dish. They're also happy to make minor substitutions to swap out pita bread with corn chips for us gluten sensitive people. So while many items on the menu may not be gluten-free friendly, the staff seems happy to substitute.  You can always find a table inside or outside, and the service is always great.",

Unfortunately they don't serve food past 10, and they do last call at 11. What? It was still decently crowded on a weekday to close down that early.

One in our party had the BBQ Chicken pizza and loved it.  The burgers were excellent as well.  Even though we were outside on the patio with just a few tables our server made sure to check on us regularly. This is definitely a place we'll be returning.",

We walked in and sat near the bar, which had high top tables, floor to ceiling windows, and even plants growing along the windowsills. I thought bugs might be a problem but not one showed up anytime during our visit.  Our waitress handed us menus and told us all food items are on HH and certain beers are only $1! And, when I checked in on Yelp, I recieved an offer for a free beer shot! They have over 60 beers on tap so lots of classics, local brews and more! In addition, I also ordered a Moscow Mule, which did NOT come in a copper mug :(  After drinks came, we ordered food. I ordered a turkey club on cibatta with house made chips and my friend ordered the cilantro shrimp pizza. Food came out and was delicious. Service overall was fine, I really liked the restaurant and food. Even though we weren't here during the evening hours to hear music, Copper Blues is definitely somewhere I want to check out again!",

My first visit to Copper Blues was a month or two ago.  The beer was good, the service was less than perfect, but the food was not very good at all.  The burger I had was sub-par.  The pulled pork sandwich my fiancee had though, was bad.  It came out cold, so we asked them to heat it up.  The waiter said they would remake it.  When we got the replacement(a solid 15 minutes later) it was almost as cold as the first.    Our second visit was this past Friday.  This time it was a matter of policy.  We were going to have a few drinks and some food.  All of us clearly above drinking age.  One of the friends in my group had recently moved to AZ and was waiting for her permanent ID to come, but she had her temporary ID given by the MVD, as well as her previous states ID(which the MVD had punched).  The bouncers wouldn't let her in, so we asked to speak to a manager.  The manager, Alex Frederickson, reiterated that she wasn't allowed in, giving no further reasoning.  What really surprised me was that instead of trying to remedy the situation, he gave away our business to a nearby bar telling us that the other bar did not have the same policy.  Understanding the importance of customer relations, that really struck a chord with me.  Needless to say, I have no intention of returning to Copper Blues.",

The place was spacious enough to move around without being up in someone's grill. The downside was that when a comedy show let out, there was a mad rush to the bar, and it took forever to get your drinks.  That being said, -- being next door to Stand Up Live is awesome. When you're done with the show, head next door to Copper Blues and have a great rest of the night recanting the jokes you've heard earlier. Often, the comedians will also come out and join you for some drinks between sets.   I'll be back!",

During the day they're fairly comparable (depending on the weather) but inside gets way too loud once the band starts.  It's fine if you're there for the music, but if you want to have any kind of conversation you are out of luck.  They have a great selection of beer on tap, with even more in bottles.  The chicken nachos are off the hook.  When they came to the table we had to clear half of the space just to put them.  They taste as good as they look, so fortunately there is plenty to share.  My friends always get the soft pretzels and they are consistently delicious.  The mac and cheese is good, but the bacon is much better than the short rib.  We will definitely continue to come here when we make our treks downtown.",

LOVE her for that! (And guys - the lady bartenders here are SUPER cute!) Whenever I've sat at a table in the evening to watch the bands the service is really slow, which is too  bad. I've actually left CBL because drinks have gone so long without being filled. Last time I was here with a gf of mine, we waited (after waving her down) over half an hour for our check. Bleh.   I say visit CBL, watch the awesome groups/bands they have FROM THE BAR... or sit at the outside bar and find some fun entertainment from those bartenders. Of course I'll be back because it's as neat place! Check em out!",

In addition they rotate the groups nicely...each Saturday (out of the last 3) they've had a distinct group. The one last night was amazing...never seen a lead singer play the drums before!",

    "text": "Ok, Copper Blues isn't cheap dive bar, but it's worth it everything they charge, and worth leaving a decent tip!  The bartenders (and that is plural) are always alive and crazy busy trying to help you behind the bar.   They get you a drink if you can only squeeze an elbow in through a crowd.  But it does get crowded at times.  If you are at a table, the staff is still pretty decent, they get it.  They know it's a popular and busy place, and they try to keep up.  At least of spring 2013, the staff and service makes it worth going to on a Friday or Saturday night. They make you feel like you matter.  I can't say it's the cheapest place, or best food.  But, the selection of beer and the service makes it worth spending some money there, if you have it to spend.",

I'll go back for sure and am planning to try the steak bites.  Cheers",

It was a Friday night, so it was pretty packed and super freaking loud.  No bigs.  They have TONS of beers, most of which (or maybe almost all?) were craft and/or local brews.  Score!    I ordered a pint of Left Hand Milk Stout, which was the best one I've ever had.  The look is cool/casual.  There are two bars: one when you first walk in and one that the band plays behind.    The music left something to be desired, but that could just be because I'm a music snob.  It was a cover band that seemed to be Maroon 5-ish (whom I loathe).  That's not to say they didn't do a good job singing and playing, just not my kind of jams.    The service was decent, didn't really interact with the staff much.  I'd definitely go back on a week night to check out the vibe.",

We came to Copper Blues for dinner before the Suns game, when we went to order drinks we were turned down because our Alberta identification was not acceptable, instead we were required to have our passports \"per Arizona state law\" we were refused alcohol service because there was no way to verify that our identification cards were \"legit\" in their verification book, I have to admit... I thought google would have been a good alternative to an ancient book..    After being refused service I looked up the Arizona department of liquor, and it clearly states : \"(1) An unexpired driver's license, identification card from any state or Canada provided it includes a picture of the licensee, and birth date\" - <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.azliquor.gov%2Ffaq.cfm%23idforms&s=7f16c783d903a72d5eca4828a4a060f03f66fc462a9bddbb8dab81a4f5d9078f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">azliquor.gov/faq.cfm#idf...</a>  If you don't plan on carrying your passport with you around town then I would not recommend this joint.  Ps. The food is sub par at best",

We ordered the pretzel sticks, spinach and artichoke dip, and hummus appetizers to share among the 4 of us (about $8 each for splitting the bill). Probably THE best spinach and artichoke dip I have ever tasted. I began dipping the pretzel sticks in it and even the carrots that came with the hummus. The second time was a week night, not as crowded. I'm not much of a beer drinker, or much of a drinker in general. So, it took me forever to decide what to get. Our server was very patient with us and kept bringing out different samples for me to try. Ciders, stouts, and fat tires were had by all. I think one of my favorites was the pear cider they had at the time- smooth and filled with an almost cinnamon/vanilla flavor. We had a great time and most certainly would've been back a 3rd time had our week not been so short.",

We got in pretty fast and was given one of the tables way up front which I must say that's what I wanted, but turned out to be a bad decision on my part. I had so many people bumping into my table and taking it upon themselves to put their stupid drinks all over my table! Our waitress wasn't the best,  but she wasn't the worst either. Our only food choices from the package I had purchase was pretty much disgusting. My boyfriend had to order something different from the regular menu and still pay for it after already purchasing the $200 New Year's package! The band on the other hand was amazing as always. Seems like my boyfriend and have decided that we won't be spending New Year's there next year",

It's my fault that the only thing Copper Blue has going for it is the location. It's my fault that I allowed myself to walk in and be looked around, over, and behind while the manbun behind the bar worked on, I guess, more deserving customers. It's my fault that we couldn't even get noticed until a couple sat down in the open seats next to us and, to get to the napkins, manbun had to knowledge our presence. It's my fault the turnaround time on any drink is however long it takes for the bartender to take the order of other customer at the bar, chat with the waitress, mix the other patrons' drinks, and then get to my whisky.   But Copper Blues pays the rent and, for that, they'll always have customers. I guess different hospitality places measure success in different ways. For my two cents, a visit to Copper Blues is one that I will never be at fault for again.",

Even if you weren't interested in talking to anyone else and just wanted to listen to the music, it was so loud that it was hurting my eardrums!  So we decided to suffer through the heat and sit on the patio, because at least it was slightly quieter out there.  It was still really difficult to talk to anyone though!  And the high-top table we were sitting at was very unstable!  I went to put my elbows on the table and the whole thing tipped over and would've fallen to the ground had we not caught it.  Good thing there were no drinks on it yet!  We left after about 10 minutes bc it was just too loud to communicate with our friends and too warm out on the patio.... I guess I'm just getting too old for places like this... but I'm still in my 20s!",

The reason I am giving it 3 stars tonight is because the main band says on their website was to start at 8 and it's 9:15 and they are just getting ready. If you advertise it - then it needs to happen. I heard the band was late. There was an error in the website and the owner and manager made it right. Great job and we will be back!",

It's a spacious bar with sit-down service, a long bar, a balcony, and a stage. They play quite a bit of live music and they had a musician on stage while we were there. We chilled out on the balcony for the most part which was a cool spot. It's not big, but if you can snag a spot, you get a nice view of the city. A nice breeze when the weather's nice and you're living the life. Another thing that stood out? Quite a few waitresses were lookers. Eye candy galore. I'm not complaining!",

    "text": "Last weekend, my boyfriend and I visited Bisbee, AZ and met a gentlemen there who told me to visit Copper Blues when I returned to Phoenix.  I'm a big beer fan, so when he said that the bar had 60 plus beers on tap, I was ready to try the place out.    My best friend and I wandered into the bar around 8 pm on a Wednesday, and I was surprised to see many customers sitting around the bar and at tables.  We sat at the bar right in front of the stage, and the bartender greeted us promptly and took our order.  I was pleased to find some of my favorites on tap - Delirium Tremens, Lost Abbey, Chimay, etc.  For those of you who do not drink beer, they had a great liquor selection to choose from.    I thought it would be ridiculously loud sitting at the bar once the live music got going, but I could still carry on a conversation with my friend without screaming at her.  A reggae band was on stage that night, and they were quite entertaining.    The only thing that I really didn't enjoy was the food.  My friend and I were both quite hungry when we ordered the food, but it wasn't good enough for us to finish it even though we were starving.  We got a plate of wings and the chicken nachos.  The buffalo wings were quite salty and lacked flavor, and the honey hot wings were not hot and tasted just like honey was poured on the wings.  As for the nachos, the actual nacho chips were way to salty, the salsa didn't have any flavor, and the chicken topping was dry and cold.    I really enjoyed the atmosphere at Copper Blues.  I would definitely visit again to have some beer and cocktails, but I know I am going to pass on the food.",

Every day is a different group or a different individual on stage. I've had the pleasure of listening to; country, reggae, hip-hop, dance, top 40, rock, if it has a beat they play it.   People are friendly, good looking bartenders.   if you get their late seating can be a little hard to find but the bar is really good about getting everyone their drink.   If you're from out of town and looking for something social in downtown Phoenix this should definitely be on the list. Comedy club is next door so you might have a picture take with a \"star\".",

    "text": "Wow. The Jersey Shore meets the Real Housewives of Scottsdale.   This was our second stop of the night, and maybe because the first stop was so cool it made Copper Blues all the more lame.  I'm looking around and I'm seeing popped collars, gelled hair, really dark eyeliner, Ed Hardy and Uggs with leggings. Seriously? People still dress this way?  I will say, they have an amazing selection of beers on tap; about 60, plus a large selection of bottles as well.  The reason we came here in the first place was for the live music. Above the bar is a stage for a band but unfortunately, there was a \"DJ\" last night. This guy sure was moving around a lot like he was doin stuff and having a grand ole time, but I have no idea what he was actually mixing. He just played Top 40 songs from start to finish. So. Lame.   Picture this if you will. 40something MILF wearing a mini dress with a slit down the back and thigh high stockings grinding on your dad. They were basically dry humping one another in the middle of the bar. If you're that old, can't you just go home and bone? I don't get it.  This is definitely not my scene and I will never return.",

However, they are just having fun so I shouldn't be such a grump.  Coming during less busy times is way better as the servers are all very sweet and cute, very few of them are dickheads (or at lest they so a good job of pretending) and at least some of them (Shelby in particular) actually know good beer.   They have a lot of singer songwriter types that play covers (defeats the definition of singer songwriter, I know), but I have to deduct a star because they cut off an Alice in Chains song in favor of playing a bunch of dumbass bullshit on the \"juke box.\"  Bad taste.   This is a personal preference review, obviously.",

Being Sunday evening it was pretty slow, but for Cinco de Mayo they had this neat band from Tucson called Santa Panchita...I think. They were good and weren't too loud or obnoxious. They had a really talented trumpet player. Unfortunately, I don't speak Spanish so I wasn't sure what they were saying but the melodies were upbeat and fun.   We didn't order any food this time, but the beer selection was great! I am NOT a beer fan by any means, so I love that they offer a free beer shot when you check in on Yelp. I tried the Papago Vanilla Orange Blossom beer. The 2 ounces was just enough since I was DD. My boyfriend and his friend love trying new beers, so they tried a few and really liked that there were so many Arizona brews represented.   We will definitely be back!",

I had never come to Copper Blues before for the food but I was very pleasantly surprised to see that they actually had a very extensive food menu and the kitchen is open LATE! I will have to come back here in the future to try more of their food. I have also tried the fries with ketchup and sriracha ranch sauce. These were killer!  Service: I was disappointed to see so many Yelpers who have had terrible costumer service here. Every time I have been here the staff has been nothing but helpful and accommodating. The bar is always packed, no matter which of the three you are at, but I seem to always be served in a timely manner. Last time I was here I had placed an order for pizza and then almost immediately changed my mind on what toppings I wanted and as soon as I told the waitress she ran to go change the order. She was awesome! I wish I would have gotten her name so I could give her a shout out. I also really appreciate the staff's commitment to the themed parties that are held here. I have been around several times when everyone on staff is dressed in costume to go along with the night's party theme. The entire bar is also very well staffed. bartenders and waiters everywhere to help serve you.  Atmosphere: On friday night this place is rocking! There are always tons of people that come out to chill and watch the live music on that iconic stage behind the bar. Copper Blues also has a pretty awesome selection of beers on draft for you to choose from. Anyone can come here and have a good time!",

The waitress, Sabrina, was not attentive and seemed annoyed if we ever ordered another drink. We were all going to get another round when she decided we were done and brought our checks. It was then that we noticed that we did not receive the happy hour prices. Of course coming downtown for multiple events & knowing they have happy hour daily, we questioned her on why we didn't receive hh prices. They decided to try something new and not do Happy Hour during bigger events downtown. I spoke with the manager and told them as a long time fan of CB, this wasn't a great move. He was totally open to understanding and affirming he made the mistake. Other than that, every other time we have been, the beer is great, the food is great and the live music is awesome!",

All I could smell coming in to this place were the nachos and they did not disappoint. Loved the veggie ciabatta sandwich and the house chips as well. Our friend had one of the burgers and he said it was terrific. Loved the vibe here, lots of seating choices and standing too if you're so inclined. I could see that this place might be busy busy on a weekend, but it was pretty fair for a Thursday evening. Might be one of my new favorites downtown and I'm planning to head back one night for live karaoke. Fun.",

We had to start waving down the bartender to get us wait staff.  I used to like this place, but after that terrible experience and how little they gave a shit I will find a better place to drink at.

Also 5 stars of the beer selection. Have seen some of those craft choices in awhile. The prices where a little high but that was as I expected with the location and amenities such as live music. Service was a huge disappointment. I would give two stars. Ordered a medium burger 20 minutes later after bartender went to check I got a well done burger. Was still good just not as ordered. Bartenders spent most of the time talking to each other and doing more watching that serving. Not sure if service is better at tables as I say at bar.

Foley bites were awesome with cilantro pesto and Bloody Mary sauce. Brussels sprouts were delish. Chicken sand was topped with cheddar and ham and mustard. We will be back.",

    "text": "I had been anticipating Copper Blues for a few weeks. I had heard good things and I can't stay away from live music. The evening started slowly when our server told us they were out of half of the beers on tap. I'm not sure why? No big deal, I found a nice selection and ordered some food neither of which disappointed. The music was fun and entertaining.. a nice selection of modern favorites and even some 80's classics. The band had a powerful sound and the crowd got more and more dense. Its noteworthy that this crowd was a bit more eclectic and \"real\" than the normal Old town feel, which was what I was looking for. A good time was had; music, beer, friends and good food!",

    "text": "Had my hopes up! Hotel concierge highly recommended Copper Blues. We walked in and I was extremely happy to see all the brews on tap. 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 25 minutes and no server even looked our way. I asked the hostess to please send someone our way. 10 minutes later... No one! We decided to head out, very disappointed. As we walked out I mentioned to the hostess that it was sad that we sat for over 30 minutes and no server gave us the time of day, even after I asked her to please send someone over to take our order. She smirked and blew me off. ZERO stars in my opinion, but they got 1 for the band.",
