I like this place, I do not come here weekly or anything,but every few weeks I stop in. Lots of parking in this lot,so no problem there. It is hard to say if I like the Baked goods best or the Salads best! They have a lot of good selections. I like some meat on my salad but, they only have chicken or fish. I would rather go for the fish. Because, Chicken is not one of my favorites. Although they have a Chicken Pomegrantie with Pistachio that could become one of my favorites very fast. They also sell pasta here, so something for everyone. The baked goods are really good and always fresh. It is always clean and the windows sparkle. I do not know why I like that about it , but I do.  It is a great place for dining in or too Gooo~",

The food is good, but it's a bit pricey for a cafeteria style restaurant like this.  The last time I was there I had a sweet potato sandwich that I literally dreamed about the night after... it was awesome.    During a particularly busy morning, we thought we were going to have to change our order to to-go due to a lack of clear tables.  One of the \"runners\" (a fellow who was delivering food to its respective table and collecting the table stands) noticed our dilemma and helped us secure a table that was just emptying.  In his haste, and probably out of habit, he took the table stand that was supposed to match up with our meal.  No harm, no foul, we flagged him down and he found our orphaned food and delivered it right away.  Friendly all around.",

The ambiance is wonderful, fresh & inviting- outside patio seating is a plus! The friendly staff is always on point to help you find seating, bringing out your food in a timely manner & clearing up your mess (not that I'm very messy!! ; )) Their menu will change to keep with the season or just to try something new, while the favorites stay available. My usual order (not all at the same time of course!) are: Honey-Cured Ham & Brie Frittata/Banana Walnut Pancakes/ Chopped Salad/Salmon Alfredo. Their baked goods are also melt-in-your-mouth  delightful! (MmMm I'm seriously salivating right now just thinking about all the yumminess!!) Lines may be long at times, specially during the breakfast/brunch rush but they move fairly fast.   In addition to the tasty food, I love this location!! It's connected to Changing Hands so be sure to browse through that amazing store before or after your meal. It's also close to Trader Joe's where we do our shopping. I highly recommend this place!",

Ignored it since I'm used to this type of service in today's industry. Most places just hire teenagers that are only required to pay their insurance and have no idea what actual responsibility is. Food was good and came it in a timely manner so I can't complain about that. Went to use the bathroom after I ate and became highly concerned due to its lack of cleanliness. The bathroom was disgusting and there was no soap in there. I hope the employees have their own bathroom because they should be washing their hands before going back to work and that's hard to do with no soap. This is my second time visiting Wildflower, the first time being at the Chandler mall location. I think it's safe to say I'll never go back to the Tempe location again.",

Being in an extremely busy shopping plaza I wouldn't have been shocked to find this location to have some issues from time to time, as with that much turnover something is bound to give. I'm happy to report that after years of dining here they have kept the highest standards at all levels. The employees are always friendly, the food consistent and tasty, and the atmosphere of the location is alway buzzing with happy diners. If you've spent any amount of time in the valley of the sun, then you've likely been a patron of wildflower, but if this is not the case; you're most definitely missing out.   Favorite dishes -  The meatball sandwich  Potato cream cheese soup  Cesar salad (best Cesar dressing around)  Chopped salad  I've been eating these same items for years, and they got the spot each time.

I had the Portobello picnic sandwich and my friend had the Wildflower Trio with a salad and turkey bread sandwich. My friend left her entire sandwich because she did not like. I did eat my portobello but clearly it was thrown together and was simply a disappointment. Not a lot of exciting sandwich choices for a vegetarian. We were still hungry so we got a sour cream blueberry muffin for her and a chocolate hip scone for me...not bad. There certainly were a lot of customers and maybe it was just too busy or we made a poor choice but after hearing how great Wildflower is, what a disappointment I felt personally.  It was not worth what I paid....I literally took my friend through a drive thru restaurant to get a quick bite before I dropped her off because she was still hungry",

Back again and again. Wildflowers portions are bigger than Panera as well for the price. Also Wildflower has better deserts. Yum!",

Wildflower is the next best thing and with some of the options it's better. This location if my favorite because you can eat some delicious soup and get some hot tea and walk around changing hands which is connected to it.   Everything I have ever eaten here is delicious. It is fast to order as well. Always a good choice.",

I've also run in to a guy my friend used to date while he is on a date... that was pretty strange.

I recommend ordering a half or sharing it... even then it is a lot of sandwhich.  A scone will fill you up for the entire morning and afternoon.

Delicious bread boules filled with tasty, filling soup (a meal in themselves), yummy fresh baked goods, refreshing wildflower iced tea (one of the best!) and of course, their lemon garlic pasta -- perfect balance of lemon, garlic, and ricotta cheese, with lots of spinach and tomato, plus two hefty slices of fresh garlic bread.  I have been known to starve the extra thirty minutes until 3 for this bowl of heaven.  Just be weary of going before or after Changing Hands events, or during the lunch rush or on weekend mornings -- finding a seat for once is hard, but trying to sit with your group?  Forget about it.  Also, they used to give away leftover pastries at the end of the night; not sure if they still do this, but definitely worth asking.",

For example, last time I went I got the harvest apple pork sandwich, and the bread was toasted to such a sharp crisp that it would cut the roof of my mouth and gums. The pork smelled a little bit haggard as well. The best things on the menu are the oriental chicken salad and the spinach lasagna dish. I wouldn't recommend the coffee, but it isnt bad.  For breakfast, this place is terrible. I ran late to class because the service took forever, and there were only like 3 people in the restaurant. I got some egg fritter thing that was pretty bad as well. slightly cold and looked like a collage of breakfast items.   As for the crowd, like the first commenter said, they dont take kindly to the hungover or the grimey looking customer. I rolled in with moccasins, basketball shorts and a greasy face/head after a night of heavy drinking and got a few stares like I was a vagrant.",

It is so sinfully good and the blueberry compote is beautiful and delicious. I like that this location is attached to Changing Hands.

Wildflower Bread Company is the perfect forum to satisfy my pancake, French toast, soup, and sandwich needs.    The lemon ricotta pancakes and the cinnamon raisin-nut French toast are the perfect carb-heavy way to start off a day.  Plus, Wildflower's iced-coffee is quite good and free flowing.  So if you need to cut the sweetness, or need a caffeine jolt, have at it.  As I said, the soups and sandwiches are also great options.  Everything from the chicken continental to the ham and Swiss sandwiches are fantastic.  Their fresh breads are an integral part of what makes this a great place to get sandwiches.   My only complaint is the restaurants' overly friendliness to loiterers.  I understand that at some point earlier in the day, the person who ordered that 1 coffee and refilled it 7 times paid for that 1 coffee.  But now there are no tables and the new paying customers are left in the lurch due to the lack of seating.  It's too bad that people seem to have lost the common sense that after a certain point it's appropriate to move on and free up tables so that other patrons can actually eat.  Yes, I'm staring you... the two old ladies lingering over iced water and breadcrumbs and empty plates, and you, the 22 year-old with the milky iced-coffee and laptop computer - pack it up!",

Adjacent to Changing Hands Bookstore, this small local change is fantastic, a great accompaniment to CHB and a great location (Guadalupe and McClintock) for a break from errands (or in my case, riding my bike-right around here is usually when I need to take a rest and eat something fast). Really warm and inviting, it reminds me of a classier Au Bon Pain (you Boston-ites will know what I'm spittin' here). A fast food restaurant that is tastier, cheaper, and friendlier than most \"sit down restaurants\".   The set up (going from the entrance from CHB, not the door) is first off a sampling of their bread of the day with either butter or olive oil to dip in. You have the line with bagels right behind the cashiers, and a small bakery case to look at such good offerings as Chocolate Pumpkin muffins and their scones and cake slices. It can be a mad house here at lunch time, many people opting to take it to go-their sandwiches go on average 6-8 dollars-but they are huge, fresh and top notch-totally worth the price. Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of meat free or dairy free options for me for lunch right now (they have seasonal menus) but for all you carnivores-DAMN. Good soups too (I would avoid the weird, mushy tomato bread stuffing on the side and replace with chips-maybe you'll like it but I doubt it). They also have huge salads and pasta entrees for dinner times.  Their breakfast and coffee is where they shine. The coffee is available at the self serve and they have a huge container of SOY MILK (yes!!!!!!) at your disposal. They can make tons of drinks and have tea as well, so if you're into that, prices seem market. But you have to try b-fest once here. Serve till 10am on weekdays, 2pm on weekends, they have stuffed french toast fruit, frittatas, I mean, it is soooooo delicious. AND FAST. If you can snag a table. Essentially you should try to have someone grab a table and tell you what they want since turnover is fast, but there are a LOT of people waiting to snag your seat (so don't linger either-its just kinda rude). The drill is you order the food, they give you a special flag for the table (if to go, you just wait near the kitchen and coffee kiosk), your coffee cup, you grab the coffee and grab a table and they bring it to you when ready. Pretty nice! Oh, and the staff is relentlessy friendly and efficient-I really don't know how they do it.  They do have seating outside that is pretty nice and a \"trust\" option for their baguettes where you drop money off and grab a fresh one near the door so you don't have to deal with the line. So grabbing some bread for the week or dinner that night is a fantastic option as well.",

    "text": "I think I like this place more in theory than in reality.  The idea of a great little cafe attached to a great independent bookstore is appealing.  The idea of fresh warm breads, savory soups, and light pasta dishes is even more so.  Unfortunately, this place isn't all roses in reality.  First, it is often annoyingly crowded.  So crowded that you may have to stand around waiting for someone to leave so you can sit and eat your food.  It's also not my crowd.  I'm often the only non-mom in the room.  The quality is also hit and miss.  The Lemon Garlic Penne, most of the time, is an amazing dish.  But a few times (say 3 out of 10), it's been so lemony that could barely finish it.  I also made the mistake of ordering a sandwich (I forget which one) on toasted ciabatta bread.  They sure did toast it.  I stopped after a few bites for fear that I'd lose a tooth.    However, the passion fruit iced tea is great, the soups and pastas are generally excellent.  It makes a great little place to get a bite and study, especially if you're willing to go at an off-time like 4pm rather than 6.",

They have this spectacular counter of delicious looking baked goods. Unfortunately, things tend to dry out. The cupcakes, on the other hand, are always wonderfully decadent. In fact, in October, they sold Cupcakes for the Cure and I definitely supported the cause.   The Tempe location is really popular with people in the neighborhood, so getting a table requires patience.",

I've been brought into the Wildflower inner circle.  I was impressed by my Roast Beef and Gorgonzola sandwich. The sandwich tasted great. This is the best roast beef sandwich I've had. The roast beef was very tender and had no fat and paired perfectly with the gorgonzola cheese.. The sourdough bread was very tasty and not hard. The veggies on the sandwich were very fresh and crispy.  As a side, I received a pasta salad. I typically don't like pasta salad, but this was very good. I just wish there was more of it. The side consisted of about 2 forkfuls of pasta.   Even though we went around peak lunch hour, our food was brought to us within 5 minutes of our order.  A sandwich and side is just under $7.  I was very pleased with my lunch. I'll head back and try some other items in the near future.",

    "text": "If you've had a wild night at a nightclub and you're looking to get some brunch the next day with a friend to share the details, this restaurant is not the place to do it.   Even if you find a seat here on weekend mornings/afternoons you are right on top of the party next to you, so make sure your conversations are G rated because they will be heard by others.  The Tempe Wildflower gets so busy that I've sometimes left and went to the Chandler Mall location because I know I'd be guaranteed a seat there.  Also, getting in and out of your seat could require repositioning the table and saying \"excuse me\" more times than you'd like. It really is tight quarters here.  I don't know if the other locations are the same, but this Wildflower runs out of items on a frequent basis. It used to be it only served pretzels on Wednesdays and the store would run out by the afternoon.  Now Wildflower serves them daily and they still run out, but the bigger issue is that there's nowhere to heat them.   Anyone who's spent significant time in northeast knows the value of a good hot pretzel. Wildflower's pretzels are quite good but they come room temp and staff  won't heat them and  only give you the option of the microwave. Gross.   And where's the mustard? That's a necessity.  I always take mine to go.  Cookies also run out and we're not talking an hour before closing. They run out early.   Breakfasts are excellent and although lunch items look delicious, 99.9% of the lunch menu comes with some kind of cheese.   Fruit cups always taste fresh, come with a yogurt and granola drizzle and a slice of carrot cake. The iced tea is excellent but I've heard mixed reviews on the exotic coffees.   The whole rat race idea to get a table on a weekend takes the pleasure away from your meal (if you can secure a table before your meal comes out).   Advice: Utilize that corner spot in the bookstore where they have those goofy novelty items and add some tables there. You won't even have to knock a wall down because the two places connect.  With all the free food you give their employees it's the least they can do for you. It's not like people are crowding that corner of their store to purchase, say, a weiner dog spiral business card holder.   Oh wait, I bought one of those there.   Go to the Chandler Mall location for more room/privacy/personal space. The food is nearly, I stress nearly, identical.",

I tried one of their sandwiches a couple years back and wasn't all that impressed, so I hadn't been back.   This time I had the Chicken Continental which is a grilled chicken breast, swiss cheese, marinated mushrooms, caramelized onion, romaine, tomato and honey mustard on a Ciabatta Roll. I got the half sandwich, half fruit salad for about $7.50. I guess I didn't read the menu fully because the fruit salad came with yogurt and granola on top. It was actually very good and a nice surprise, not too much yogurt. Sometimes places like to drown the fruit in it. I appreciate that they use a variety of fruit (watermelon, canteloupe, grapes, pineapple, and melon). Most places like to skimp out and just give canteloupe and melon with a couple of grapes thrown in for color.   All of it was quite tasty and more filling than I expected. I thought the bread quality was quite good and the flavors of the sandwich worked together. I went back a second time within a week because I liked the sandwich so much. Next time I'll have to branch out and try something else.",

As soon as we sat down the noise began.  After a few incredible loud episodes I very nicely asked the worker if he could be a little quieter when placing dishes, silverware and glasses in the bins.  He insincerely replied that he would try.  It was literally 10 seconds later when the threw more dishes into the bins.  OMG!  It was so loud that our conversation was interrupted more than two dozen times during our meal due to spontaneous responses our bodies had to the sharp loud noises.  Another couple sat down next to us not long after I had spoken to the worker.  Within seconds their heads whipped around at the next tossing of dishes.  Over the course of our meals we all bonded on the ridiculously rude and arrogant attitude of this young man.  There is no way management could not hear this racket.  All of us agreed the food was good but we would NEVER return again to eat at Wildflower and instead go to Paradise Bakery which was far more respectful of it's customers.  My other disappointment was that they did not have any gluten free bakery options, sort of crazy they haven't implemented a few options by now.",

I gave it one dollar sign but really it sits nicely at about one and a half. BUT, for that extra half a dollar sign you go from Taco Bell to my girlfriend's nana's mexican food, metaphorically speaking because there aren't really any tacos here. I hate this cliche, but you get plenty bang for your buck.   B) Not only is it cheap! Not only are the portions descent, oh no, my friends! It's actually tasty too! Step right up and let me shove some sweet pimped out BLT in your mouth for you. Of course there's nice, crispy bacon, cold ripe tomato's and refreshing, crunchy greens laid upon the savory twelve grain bread (delicious!). Tambien, there's a nice pesto sauce that does a more than ok job at replacing the mayo usually dripping from my BLT, and thick slices of a kind of sharp cheddar cheese that get's the job done without making it taste like one big chunk of cheese. YUMMIE!  C) There are so many INTERESTING people, from ditzy ASU girls to Biz-Casual-Boat-Shoes-Wearin-Old-Crankies that are getting pissed because they can't figure out why the table that people just left from is still dirty. So now they're going to snap their fingers at the poor bus boy to clean up what has now become their rightful spot in the resteraunt because THEY'VE been waitning in line and THEY saw it first so anyone who has anything to say can listen to them be as passive aggresive as possible. Then they get all snooty and I have something to make fun of for a while longer, it's awesome. I feel bad for the bus boy and the other employees that have to deal with all the crap, so leave a tip in the tip jar up front for god's sake!

It also helps that this location opens up to Changing Hands Bookstore next door. Coffee, good food and books seem to go hand in hand.  Then I stepped up to the counter. My eyes were greeted with a feast of various baked goods. I looked up at the menu and was pleased with the choices available. I have had lunch and dinner here. Everything I have had as been really great. I especially enjoy their soup in bread bowls. It's a step above panera bread company for me. There is just a certain flair there. I also really enjoy their iced tea. The only criticism of this place is that there coffee can be a bit bland. Oh, and I've bought loaves of bread here too. They were wonderful.

We ordered butternut squash ravioli, cheese ravioli and a chocolate chip bagel toasted with butter.  First we sat down in a both in which people had just left, there was no one around cleaning tables so we cleaned it off ourselves and then when they brought our food, I asked if she could wipe down the table.  She went and got a rag and wiped down only part of the table leaving many crumbs still on the table.  Then we lifted the bread up that came with the butternut squash ravioli and it had a hair.  We returned that and asked that it be remade, which they agreed to do and apologized for.  The cheese ravioli was luke warm at best.  I then asked for just some marinara sauce that was warmed up so I could at least try to eat the food without sending the whole thing back.  It took about 10 minutes for them to bring that and by then of course the ravioli was cold by then.  The bagel was barely toasted and so the butter really did not melt- so it was basically a cold bagel with clumps of butter.  They did remake the butternut squash ravioli but because it was rushed, it was undercooked.  Overall, not a good experience at all.  I will stick with the Chandler Mall location!",

Thanks to our server Stephanie who was so sweet and kind to my daughter and I. She noticed my daughter was carrying a Lego set and came and told her that she really liked Legos too.

So tonight, my sister-in-law and I wanted to satisfy our sweet tooth so we thought we would try out Wildflower. It was busy as usual but the staff was still friendly and Jessica Gomez in particular took the time to describe the different pastries to us and recommend some tasty treats. She made us feel important and was so nice. Come to think of it, every time I have picked up an order, she has always been so pleasant. Anyway, we ordered way too many sweets but we enjoyed them and especially the chocolate chip scone. My SIL tried the potato soup and it did not disappoint. We will definitely be back to try other items. Such a nice little joint to enjoy a treat. See Jessica, she is so sweet!",

The chicken is always moist and flavorful.   I joined others and they were all jealous of my selection!  I'm not sure what the dressing was but its probably not my favorite, fortunately this salad doesn't require any dressing because the veggies were well seasoned.

I love the Tempe location. I especially love the connection to Changing Hands book store. It's so fun to check out the books and then to sit with a yummy bread bowl of potato soup and admire your new book purchases.  THE MENU   The menu is pretty great!   They serve breakfast until: 10:30am week days/2pm on weekends  Breakfast: Frittatas Breakfast Sandwiches Oatmeal Fruits Bagels Signature Pancakes (my favorite are the lemon ricotta) (see pics)  Lunch/Dinner: Soups served in the sourdough bread \"boule\" (my favorite is the potato soup) Specialty Sandwiches Salads Pastas  Most every item is under $10.   Wildflower Bread Company has a great catering business too!   They have a wide selection of breakfast, lunch and appetizer and dessert packages for catering.   Hours: Sat 7am - 9pm Sun 7am - 8pm Mon - Fri 6am - 9pm  For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FWildFlowerBread.com&s=335242e4c52742e34bac92ca807dfb27fd161e176a54f634f21d5e3a3b44124c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">WildFlowerBread.com</a>  I 4/5 highly recommend Wildflower Bread Company!",

I came during my lunch break and drove 15 minutes to get there, so I was excited when I ordered a chicken parmesan. When I paid, my card got declined. My whole face fell.  \"I'm so sorry I have to cancel my order. I forgot they're mailing me a new debit card because my card expired,\" I said. I was beet red with embarrassment and even more bummed out that I drove a quarter of my break to go back to the office hungry. I didn't express any of this to the cashier, but as I turned to walk away, the cashier called after me, \"Wait, hey it's okay. It's on us.\" I looked at her in disbelief. \"Are you sure??\" I asked her.  She smiled, \"Yeah,\" and she rang up the order, \"It's okay, it happens,\" she said. I thanked her graciously! So first off, I want to thank this specific store and staff, for this act of kindness. One act of kindness is all it takes to make someone's day a little better, and it not only made mine, but is something I will always remember. Second off, my chicken parm was delicious! It was fresh mozzarella chunks that were melting off into delicious chicken - the ingredients were fresh and delectable. I absolutely loved the way they plated it.` For this, I have to give this eatery a 5-star, good food, great service? I don't care if it's a chain, this place rocks and I'm a fan.",

    "text": "I always stop into the Tempe Wildflower cafe after visiting Changing Hands, because it's a fantastic place to settle down into a good book or have dinner with some of my fellow book club members. The location can get really crowded after dark on weeknights, but there's always plenty of seating on Sunday evenings and afternoons.  The food can be hit-or-miss, and even the quality of its best items can vary wildly depending on who made it. My personal favorite menu item is the butternut squash ravioli, although the sauce is often poorly made. The best drink, bar none, is the blackberry orange lemonade. In addition to its ordinary menu, there are new seasonal items available every couple of months. The baked sweets are very rich, and sometimes end up overwhelming the sandwiches/other meal items if ordered together. Good luck trying to get a white vanilla cupcake, though--they're always sold out. On average, the food is a little overpriced, but an evening out won't break the bank either.  After patronizing the location for nearly two years and at least two or three times a month, I can safely say the most of the waiters and waitresses skew towards inexperienced college students, and the service is about what can be expected from that crowd. Sometimes the service is wonderful and enthusiastic, other times they make you feel unwanted or unreasonable. The premises is adequately clean most of the time, but you can usually tell when it's been a busy day or night. Make no mistake, there WILL be flies about.   Pass on the breakfast menu. For the prices, you can do breakfast much, much better elsewhere.",

I noticed the Sour Cream Blueberry Muffin online, so after I got the card (about 10:30am), I also noticed they were out of that muffin. No big deal right - things sell out, but customer service tells me otherwise:   Hi Brad,  Our standard is to be 100% in stock. I am so sorry to hear we were out of the Sour Cream Blueberry muffins! Did you speak with a Manager? Was this at the Tempe location?   The only thing I could think of is that someone came in and ordered a very large unexpected order for a catering however that would be a guess and it is always best to go straight to the source!   I did receive an apology, but never got an explanation about why they were out of that muffin, despite this policy. Anyway, the pumpkin/chocolate muffin was outstanding, but if that really is your policy, then get it right!. I'm not sure whether these things are baked in-store or at a central facility, but that may have been a factor.    Tried the scones, but they are not great. Blueberry Muffin better.",

People waiting for food after ordering get in the way of people waiting to order or people trying to get drinks. To gos just take so long you might as well stay and eat (if you can find a table).",

That being said, someone definitely needs to put some money into maintaining this place and properly training its employees. Last visit, I ordered a salad and let's just say it was all dressing...to the point where it made me nauseous when I was trying to choke it down. I brushed it off when the management told me they were training someone new in the kitchen so it wasn't a big deal. This past visit, however, there was soap present in the green tea and the booths are falling apart. When you're asking someone to pay $9 a plate, there should be higher standards than this...I may just make the very long drive to the one in Scottsdale or the one at Chandler mall as I have been extremely disappointed in this location.",

I wish they had more of them around, but they're pretty similar to Panera Bread, but Wildflower has better bread than Panera. It's always a great experience every time I go so I definitely couldn't think of anything negative to say. Overall a fantastic lunch or brunch spot!",

The service was semi-friendly, it was late lunch time and they were busy but not crazy busy. I opted for the Salmon Caesar Salad (recommendation from the employee.) The salad consisted romaine lettuce (which was not \"crispy\" like noted on the menu,) capers, grated parmesan cheese, croutons (soggy) and caesar dressing (dressing was a decent flavor.) On top of the salad was the \"Wild Alaska Salmon Fillet\" which was super dry, had absolutely no seasoning and had a mild hint of freezer burn taste. It clearly was an older piece of fish that had been in the freezer for far to long. It was totally my fault for expecting far better but they definitely should have tossed that chunk of meat out long ago. On the brighter side, the bread served with the salad was really good & the iced tea was enjoyable too.   Safe to say, stick to the bakery items (sandwiches & baked goods.) Definitely DO NOT ORDER THE \"Wild Alaska Salmon Fillet Caesar Salad.\" Yuck!",

    "text": "I have heard of Wildflower Bread Co. for years now, and I finally tried it out today!! Per usual I called in a take out order of their cream cheese potato soup and a rueben sandwich...  First of all, I must say the gentleman that took my order was pleasant to deal with, and when I arrived to pickup my order it was all ready to go ... There were no issues with the order nor was anything forgotten ... So customer service wise I was a satisfied customer!  The rueben was quite tasty, but the potato cream cheese soup that everyone raved about on yelp was only okay for me ... I loooove soup, all kinds both hot and cold and I just didn't think anything stood out about this soup ... it was really just so-so/whatever for me.  Overall, for the price I believe the rueben should have been a larger portion for the price or the price point should have been a few dollars less around 7.79 rather than 9.79..... Same for the soup.  My total order came to approximately $16 for the soup and sandwich, and I think that is waaay too expensive to spend on lunch.    Would I return and refer others?  I would return and refer others, but there was nothing exceptional about my experience here.  It was very good for a chain though ... Which is why I gave it 4 stars.   If you are a soup aficionado I would pass on the potato soup  - it's really not worth the price for a bowl ... I've had better soup and a bigger portion for a fraction of the cost from sprouts.   I would return for the rueben because it was good, but I won't ever become a regular because I think it's a bit overpriced for the portion ... This is definitely no NY style deli, but fairly decent for AZ standards ...",

It is a turn off as a patron, even though we live in a day and age where social media and cell phones have taken over. I think it's important, in a workplace setting, that companies encourage their staff to put their phones away while they work. They're too much of a distraction and it's very unprofessional to have them hanging out of your worker's back pockets.",

I've had this before and knew what to expect and figured since nothing had to be cooked it would be a quick in and out.  I was wrong.  Having no other guests arrive during my wait, I watched the line \"cooks\" prepare the three tickets.  Two were employee meals and the third was mine.  Not only did I see one cook toss a small bag onto the cook top for pickup, I could hear their conversation and trust me it was not one to be overheard.  My order slow to prepare so when it was finally ready I rushed out.  Having no seats near the take out area, I stood waiting, watching. The worst part, when I got home the salad was a HUGE disappointment.  The strawberries were not fresh and there was barely enough spinach in the bottom of the container.  I will absolutely NOT go back.  For $13.00 I'll go down the street to Salad to Go.",

I ordered potatoes and they seem to take a excessive amount of time to get to my table.  I probably could have and should have said something.  I got them and they were cold.  I did eat them since I was pressed for time.  I mentioned it to the guy cooking and he wanted to make me something, but I had waited a bit already and needed to leave.  I did go back another time and it was similar in the morning.  I will give this place a break for a while.",

They have a great variety of breads and pastries. This particular location is my favorite (McClintock and Warner) as sometimes I bring my JRT and they are nice to give me a water dish :). Good ambiance too as they are next to a Changed Hands bookstore. Come and enjoy the relaxed atmosphere.",

However, their potato cream cheese soup is my absolute favorite. That with one of their sourdough rolls  or any of their fresh baked bread because it's all so delicious.   The service is always very warm and genuine. Anthony and Lina both do a wonderful job making sure all customers are happy with their experience, all while never losing a smile on their faces. 11/10 I would recommend!",

I went in during dinner time and you couldn't make the mac and cheese because your alfredo sauce was out, which also meant a lot of the pasta menu was unavailable. I ended up with cheese ravioli in marinara and a french onion soup. However, the cheese ravioli looked different than when I've previously had it it. It used to be soft and delicious, but now it tastes like what you get in the frozen aisle - too-chewy outside and pasty inside, *and* it was served to me partially cold. The french onion soup was also a bowl of limp onions topped with a tiny piece of toast with a tiny piece of cheese melted on it. For $30 for 2 people, I'm disappointed. Maybe it was an off night, who knows, but I won't be returning for a while.",

It was pretty good but I do wish they had a lighter version of the salad dressing.  I didnt realize till after I ate it of course when I looked up the nutrition info that the salad dressing had 20 grams of sugar and the whole salad with dressing was 27 grams.  While looking at nutrition info I noticed it said there was feta in the salad.  Feta?  What feta?  I called in to let them know.  Nick the manager asked me where I was located.  He was prepared to have someone bring me the feta.  Now that is some serious customer service.  I told him I scarfed salad too late and I wouldnt make you do that either.  He is replacing the salads for next visit.  :-)",

Service was good, prompt, polite, and efficient, and the place was clean and tidy.  4.5 stars for those items.  We had:  Side Caesar salad:  My daughter thought the dressing was a little bit, in her words, \"sour.\"  I tried it, and maybe it was a little bit on the \"tart\" side.  Veggies were fresh and crunchy though, so it was not a total loss.  3.5 stars.  Chicken Basil Chili in a sourdough Boule:   fairly tasty, IMHO.  My son thought it was a little bland, but his tastes are kinda weird.  I tried it, and I thought it was good.  The sourdough was fresh and good. 3.0 stars.  Side of meatballs with marinara sauce:  The star of the meal.  Very tasty sauce, and the meat was firm and tasted how a meatball is supposed to taste, in both texture and seasonings.  4.5 stars for this dish.  I had the \"Gorgonzola Pasilla Chile Penne - creamy alfredo, white wine, pasilla chile flakes, crushed red pepper, red peppers, gorgonzola and arugula $7.99\"   It was good.  Could have used some MEAT - maybe I could have added chicken to it, but I failed to notice it was meatless when I ordered it - MY BAD !!   I'd have it again if it had chicken in it.  It was a nicely seasoned and prepared dish.  4.0 stars.  All in all, a MUCH better trip than my first one.  I might have to give them a couple more visits to make sure.... :)",

Panera can act like they care about people all they want, but in the end they lack morals. I understand you need to make a profit however, I know for a fact that by selling a cup of tea you make more than enough to allow the customers 3 teabags on a visit and still make a profit. . Just like the Paradise bakery across the street, the only two places I've left a yelp review, the Panera family of companies doesn't really care, they're just an over priced fast food company trying to ride the coat tails of actual companies who care about providing quality products and services.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wildflowerbread.com%2Fflower-shop%2F&s=e61cd44f2c974fbeccc8676f388fac9920a8145a709a4d722ea59b403d0bf640\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">wildflowerbread.com/flow...</a>",

When I called to place the order on Saturday the employee said they would put it on the delivery order for later that day. I called later in the evening and the order had never been placed. Another employee said she would put it on the order for the next day's delivery (just in time for the party), but when I called the next day again the order was never placed and there was no cake available anywhere in the valley. We were very frustrated as we now had no cake for the Birthday celebration. The manager at this Wildflower escalated the issue to the VP who to make things right paid for our entire meal at the resturaunt where we were celebrating. He truly was genuinely sorry for the mix up and we could not belie how above and beyond Wildflower went. They really do have good food and we will now remain loyal customers.",

I had to ask if we did something wrong and in that question I had to ask \"oh, are you closed\" and still had a passive answer. We ended up walking out. Sorry for being 2 minutes late! Maybe you should lock your doors or speak up next time. UPDATE:  The management contacted me immediately after and apologized and was very responsive to our problem.

Of course again today they were out (which I found out after waiting in line for over 15 minutes without my order being taken) then Waited over 15 minutes for a different bagel and a bowl of soup. once I got to work figured out that there was no bagel in the bag! Which is extremely disappointing considering that was going to be the only chance I had for food my entire 8 hour shift. And the soup was for a coworker. Anyways so I called them and they were very condensing, I understand it isnt the end of the world that my bagel wasn't in the bag but considering I won't have food for 8 hours and waited in total about 30 minutes for a simple bagel and soup, it is frustrating that my complaint was not taken seriously or professional. There were also multiple people while I was in the store complaining about how long they had waited in line before getting to order and all the people waiting for the to go order where complaining about how long it was taking. And when I heard a man complain they were rude to him as well. Therefore, I know it is not only me that they were unprofessional with.",

Probably didn't help that we were there during the lunch rush (1pm), but whatever.   We went inside, the place is really nice. The front is a little disorganized, not knowing where the line ended and when people were just waiting to get a drink, but we managed our way to the counter.   We all ordered the braised beef sandwich (lots of variety in our group). If I hadn't had the sample of that, I'm not sure what I would have ordered since everything sounds so good. I got the blackberry orange lemonade (BOMB!) and we scurried to find an open table somewhere.   After finding out that the color and bakery item on your tag tells the staff  who gets what, we all got our sandwiches and dug in. I have to say that I HATE worcheschtirewhatever sauce, so I quickly avoided that and used up the au juis. I have to say it was pretty fantastic, plus, though it didn't look like a lot of food, it was very filling.   I would 100% come here again and try out something new.

The ladies at the counter were really friendly and helped us make the most of our order. They obviously enjoy working with the public.  We ordered the Hummus Plate, Kid's Linguine with pesto on the side, the Turkey & Brie sandwich an of course our son had a giant pretzel. The hummus plate was great, but the Turkey Brie was fantastic. We really enjoyed our meal. The best part were the four little pumpkin pie bites they brought to us. I only got a tiny bite they were so good the kids gobbled them up, pardon the Thanksgiving pun, couldn't resist.   The restaurant was clean with plenty of room to navigate with children. The staff was friendly and in a great mood every one of them!  Thanks for a great pre-movie family meal!",

In my mind I imagined a hipsters paradise next to the Changing Hands bookstore that I really would disapprove of going to. Trusting her knowledge of my stomach, I went with her there one night for dinner. Boy was I wrong. Wildflower is filled with young professionals, students, and other local members of the community and is pretty anti hipster *phew*.   At the rear of the restaurant is their counter and cashier station. The counter is filled with such amazing treats, and on wooden shelves behind here are dozens of freshly baked loaves of bread. The best part is that on fridays they have challah!   For lunch of dinner, I order the 1/2 sandwich and soup special. While they change their soup selection daily (they usually have around 4 choices), I generally order the chicken noodle and the almond tuna sandwich. This sandwich is very delicious. My girlfriend loves their pesto pasta with chicken, but they only serve it during the dinner hours.  For $7.25 you get a great meal that will convince you to come back for more.",

I used to live right by this location at the Cottonwood apartments and my mom would take me here on special occassions.   I really enjoy this location because the crowd of people that come here are really easy going. You get really great service at this sit down cafe.    What truly makes Wildflower great? Their food is really delicious and not processed. You get quality food and unique recipes. I loveeee their hot Potato Cream Cheese soup with an order of salad or half a sandwich. Oh! That's another great thing about this place. They give you the freedom to mix match your meal. You can choose half of a sandwich or salad from their huge variety of menu items  A lot of my friends are vegetarians and this is a great spot if your looking for meat free choices.   SOME OF MY FAVORITE DISHES HERE ARE:  1.) Butternut Squash Raviloi-I think this one is seasonal.  It's lightly sweetened and melts like butter.   2.) Potato Cream Cheese soup in a sourdough bread bowl- The hard crust of the roll keep the soup from spilling out. The inside of the roll is all fluffy and soak in creamy cheesy potato heaven.   3.) Chinese Chicken Salad- It's a bit sour with the vinegar but the cucumbers and other fresh ingredients balance the tartness of the dressing.  AND CAN YOU SAY BREAKFAST? DELISH! what kind of bakery would this be without bomb pastries?  One last thing is the bookstore \"Changing Hands\" (It is an independent owned bookstore) which is connected to the cafe. It's great because after you order you can feel free to browse the shop. They also get great authors to come and speak about their publications. (Some authors have included Hillary Clinton and  Aron Ralston-Between a Rock and a Hard place) If you ever get a chance to go...Go! You can thank me later.    Here you will get great bread and books. Does it really get any better than that?",

Worthy of five stars and the praises of a million angels. The second, third, eighth, eleventh time I've been here though...those angels had gotten their wings clipped.   The food at Wildflower is a hit or miss for me. Sometimes the bread is fantastic, but the rest of the sandwich isn't. Other times, it's the other way around. Very seldom do they do the perfect sammy dance together and that is just so unfortunate. Sitting right next to a cool independent bookstore in a plaza that boasts a Trader Joe's and an indie record store, you'd think that Wildflower would be the place to be. Instead, it's often crowded with bitchy,entitled suburban moms (who surprisingly have zero manners) and is staffed with young space cases who get orders mixed up.   The world would be a much better place if the folks at Duck and Decanter just used Wildflower Bread and got rid of all the nonsense.",

I wish I knew my cashier's name, it is nowhere on the receipt (they should start doing that!)... but I would give him 10 stars! Super friendly and very kind! They also manage to keep the place very clean in spite of all the families bringing their messy kids lol. There is always a busser walking around. As far as the food goes, I have been going to this place and the Chandler location for 3 years now and I am IN LOVE with the chopped salad. It is a great mix of salmon, fresh green goodness and crunchy cool flavor with a delicious pesto dressing!  drool... I could live off of that salad. I also love their soups. The staff is kind enough to give you a sample if you are unsure ;) . I also just had their cheesecake for the first time yesterday, they have plenty of great pastries to choose from and freshly baked bread every day! Love it, I only wish I lived next door",

Typically, I try to make a bathroom break and order food before I set up my laptop.  It actually took 30minutes.  Long wait for the one stall bathroom and when I finally got to the register to order a coffee, the cashier thought it was appropriate to casually give out samples of teas and soups to the customer in front of me, and socialize with the customers while the man shopped in changing hands bookstore and then finalize the purchase when he came back.  The cashier never thought to say, I'll help the customers behind you while you decide your order and shop in the store. There was a child that came up to the counter to ask a question, no acknowledgment, then it looked like her mother came up to the counter.  Again no acknowledgement.  The mother finally lined up behind me in line to get assistance.   The rest of the staff was just starring into space.   I asked if they were understaffed and the cashier said no. She seemed irritated that I was upset.",

It has an established feel, it's been there for a while and everyone knows everyone. The same people are there everyday, and it's really nice.  The potato cream cheese soup in a bread bowl is amazing. The BLTPlus sandwhich (a BLT with avocado) is my favorite, so delicious! The only problem with this location vs. the others, is that there are limited outlets -  and I'm a big mobile office person! I need to be able to get good food, free wifi and a plug for my laptop.

I don't dislike this place, but have found you need a lunch-time strategy to get in and out in a reasonable amount of time (e.g. drop two friends at the door while the third parks the car, one friend orders while the other is on reconnaissance to find a table).  It ends up working out in the end as I have never received my plate in my hands, but eating here is not a leisurely lunch - not by a long shot!  The food and drinks are good, but not worth the trouble of our \"tag-team\" effort.

The sandwich is on sourdough bread and has rare cut of roast beef, gorgonzola, roasted red peppers, red onion and a tomato & herb mayo. This was an amazing sandwich!!! So dang good, like I am drooling just typing this up and must go back soon for it!!  The coleslaw wasn't my favorite, but the delish sandwich made up for whatever the coleslaw was lacking.  When I was ordering I noticed in the bakery display a carrot cake, OMG that's my favorite type of cake!!! So I had to get me a slice! It had carrots, spice, raisins, and a perfect amount of cream cheese frosting. Sweet bliss I tell ya!   Wildflower Bread Company will  become a great lunch time spot for me.",

Now they have 3 silver dollar pancakes on the plate and charge the same amount. I have no idea why they would do this. It is ridiculous. I have 2 teenage boys now who could fill up on a large stack before but I would have to order three meals to do the same now. It is the cheapest  move I have seen in a restaurant in ages.

The frittatas are also a popular choice. Potatoes, and bread  come with meal. Lunch is usually a salad: chopped with salmon, or a turkey pastrami sandwich and chips.  Dinner: salads, soups, and most sandwiches are easy picks. Fresh pie is a great finish.",

My last visit I tried their new Farmhouse Farro Salad and it had way too many nuts for my liking. I asked for clarification about the Parmesan herb dressing that comes on it and they explained it's actually their Caesar dressing. I thought it was funny they'd rename it to sound fancy for this salad.   Big fan of their bread but it's dangerous! I can't not eat it if it's on my plate! The broccoli cheddar soup is also to die for and it tastes a lot like the one at Panera. Their teas come in cute little individual boxes. Haven't had a chance to try any of their desserts or coffee drinks yet but they look like they'd be tasty.   What I like most about this location is it's connected to my favorite, local bookstore. They offer free wifi so it's a great spot to sit, read, chill or catch up on some work --or at least pretend like you are doing something while you actually people watch ;)",

The food is generally of a higher quality that chain spots with a good selection of soups, salads, and sandwiches. Generally if one asks, one can substitute proteins on the salads. I'm a fan of the French toast for breakfast and the half and half for lunch with the roasted sweet potato sandwich and a Caesar. I find the marinated mushrooms on the Caesar really out of place and always skip them. The Asian Chicken salad subbed with chopped salmon is also really tasty. A word of caution, this place is a mad house from 12-1 and, in my opinion, should be avoided with the exception of call ahead orders.",

If you want something different than chicken,  I won't give you a hickey but something finger lickin', The gorgonzola and roast beef will not sicken, I don't care if your from France or Great Britain, The herb mayo on sourdough gets the pulse to quicken, If it were up to me I would name your cat \"Mitten\", Jim Carey was in a movie called \"Once Bitten\", This is a great place to eat, hunger now stricken!!

    "text": "Was here for a quick dinner tonight with Sharon H. as we were both looking for something in Tempe that filled the requirements of quick, healthy and cheap and this was about all the two of us could figure out. She had the Albacore tuna sandwich and I opted for the Roast beef and Gorgonzola.   Sharon said this and I quote of hers: \"This is so good I could eat two of these\" and \"the almonds just make me want to keep eating.\" That was following an arrival where she said it was too big and she should have gotten a half.  Sadly I was not as impressed with mine. While solid it was nothing I would crave or devour. The roast beef was wonderful and not over cooked which is rare but the mayo which it touted as being herb spiced mayo seemed nothing more than plain old mayo and there was too much of it. The cheese and beef combo worked well but I like the Beef and Brie at Bison Witches pairing better.   The bread however was awesome on both with no complaints in that department.  I will keep coming back but probably as a change of pace from dillys and bison witches as those are two of my favs when i want a soup and sammy deal",

I've found a few items that I really enjoy such as the penne pasta with basil pesto and the bread bowls with nearly any of their soups. All of their sandwiches that I've had were just ok, but nothing I disliked. I just tried their breakfast for the first time last week and it was outstanding. Unfortunately they only offer it in the morning. (A little later on the weekend) Be careful about coming on peak times as the dining room fills up pretty frequently and it can be difficult to find a table. It's a great place to carry out from though, as there is a bookstore next door that is fun to peruse as you wait for your meal.  Oh and make sure you try their Toffee Tort. It is incredible.",

The balance of this dish with the feta then sweet from the cranberries and then crunchy, dried corn along with the sunflower seeds are just brilliant. And then there's the delicious bread (don't be afraid to ask for a different type) along with the amazing pesto dressing that accompanies the dish...mmmh. Seriously AMAZING.  I took half of it home because I also decided on a cup of thier Mushroom soup.  YUMMY.   Anthony, one of the managers, was wonderful and provided excellent customer service today. Very kind and has a strong desire to please. A sweet girl named Taylor was also very attentive and came back to our table several times to remove plates and grab us some to go containers and bags- super hard working girl- it was totally appreciated. I haven't tried too many things as I can't find myself to venture away from the Chopped salad but from what I am told, all thier food is great. Try them out. =)",

    "text": "Wildflower was okay.  It reminds me a lot of Paradise Bakery (if you put me inside one or the other it would be hard to tell the difference).  I'm not a big fan of Paradise, either, but I figured I'd give Wildflower a try.  The sandwich I had was a hot pot roast kind of thing (I can't remember the name and they no longer offer it).  The ingredients themselves were all fairly good, but brought together, it sounded more like a garage band than a symphony.  I think they try to do a bit too much with their menu and try to throw together a bunch of vaguely fancy or artisanal sounding ingredients just for the sake of the name of the final product.  Honestly, with some of the menu items it seems like someone came up with an item name, thought it sounded fancy and unique, and then worked on building a sandwich to fit the name.  It'd be like coming up with a great movie title then building a convoluted plot to fit the title: it's going in the wrong direction.  So, basically, it seems like their menu is overly complex.  There's nothing wrong with having a dozen ingredients on a sandwich if they go together, but just stuffing whatever sounds pleasant on a sandwich doesn't always work.  Plus, their sandwiches are made to order.  That's not a bad thing, but when you have so many ingredients on a sandwich, the sandwich will sometimes benefit from being wrapped and chilled for a bit to give the flavors some time to marry (so the sandwich works as a unit and not as a bunch of layers fighting for attention on the palate).  I may go back and try it again.  Frankly, this isn't my kind of place, but there are some other things I wouldn't mind trying.  If you like Paradise, you'll probably like this place.  I don't like Paradise, so maybe it has ruined this kind of restaurant for me.  Between the two, go to Wildflower.  They seem to be pretty much the same, but at least Wildflower is a local chain and not a regional/national chain.",

It was really tasty and just the right amount of food.  The cookie was fresh and the butterscotch / coconut combo was just right.

It is always super busy in the afternoon but they were pretty quick about getting my order out. Some things are overpriced for what you get. For this reason, I usually stick with coffee. A great day is shopping at the Trader Joe's, yoga, bookstore, and then a latte from Wildflower.",

And of course I left with another Morning Glory muffin.  I only ate half at a time though.  I'm sure a Morning Glory whole would be pretty fulfilling.  Wildflower is growing on me...  Adding another free wifi place to my list doesn't hurt either.",

The cafe's aromas proved impossible to resist and we quickly allowed our stomachs to lead us from the books to the Cafe.  My friend and I enjoyed the Sweet potato and greens protein bowl, and the red white and blue  freshly baked bread. First time trying it all: won't be my last.  The protein bowl was enough for leftovers but the loaf of bread barely made it home. It was a gift from my friend and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Green tea sweetened with honey rounded out my meal.

We enjoyed Wildflower so much we ate here twice on our last trip to Phoenix and we'll definitely come back.. Fresh product and generous portions.   - Cheddar Braised Beef Hot tender braised beef, cheddar and caramelized onions, mashed potatoes and arugula on grilled Ciabatta Roll, served with au jus, horseradish sauce, original and sweet potato chips Very tasty, too bad it's only a seasonal item.  - Hungarian Beef and the Hearty Beef and Vegetable soup. The perfect Choose-Two option on a cold Phoenix night. They also didn't skimp on the beef.   - Unlike the Chandler location, Tempe's location gives a full cookie with each kid's meal. You only get a 1/2 cookie in Chandler. - Could really upgrade their drink options. Both the Habit Burger and Panera have better drink diversity. - Their bakery items are not very good compared to Panera.",

Both were beautifully presented, and DELICIOUS. The sauce-to-salad ratio was perfect in the Asian chicken salad, and it was simple, light, and fresh. The pesto dressing on her salad was diviiiine; she found it a little salty for a salad dressing, but it was particularly phenomenal as a dip for the bread.   I can't wait to try their soups and salads in the future!

The space is a little smaller and tighter than most of the other locations I've been too, but it does have some outdoor seating to make up for it.  What really sets this location apart from the others is that it shares an open wall with the book store next door.  I can't explain why, but it really adds to the ambiance.  My only complaint is the parking lot, which is something that Wildflower itself cannot help.  The shopping center is packed with some big stores and restaurants, and barely has enough spaces to accommodate a Saturday afternoon lunch crowd.  Oddly enough, I've noticed this problem that a couple of other Wildflowers.",

I ordered a Reuben sandwich and it was delicious. Bread was soft and fresh and the ingredients were put together just right. Delicious and moist and made me go mmm when I bit in to it (sounds kinky - but seriously it's a great sandwich) Service was good too :) Definitely worth a visit -- be warned though this is a popular place so keep this in mind and plan for a little wait depending on time of day.

The noddles were overcooked, which is disappointing at how basic it is to cook noodles. Also, they didn't drain them well because my pasta had a lot of excess water in the bowl. The pasta came with vegetables but they were very sparse. The bread that came with the meal was one million times better than the pasta. Thank goodness for it or I might have walked away completely hungry.  I frequently eat at Wildflower Bread Co and have good things to say about their other locations. If I go here again I will probably order a sandwich since it seems something as trivial as boiling noodles is out of their league.",

There are several Wildflower Bread Companies around the Valley of the Sun, and I've eaten in more than one . . . but none better than the one in my hood. Walking distance. Just a hop, skip and a jump from my front door.  I stop by on a fairly regular basis to try something new, or get one of my long-standing favorites. I have never, EVER been disappointed. They are always spot on with service & eats.   A few days ago I took some visiting family here for breakfast. I was hoping that they would find it as scrumptious as I always do. We are an animated bunch, so I was hoping to get a word in edgewise so I could see if they truly liked Wildflower. Well, it was not difficult to ascertain . . . once our plates arrived we ate in silence. Oh, there was the occasional \"Please pass the pepper . . . ,\" but, for the most part, we all just shoveled in the breakfast goodies!   No need to ask . . . everyone at the table gave Wildflower an outstanding Grade of \"A+\".",

I am vegan and when I got back to my office and opened my salad that was suppose to be cheeseless I found cheese hiding at the bottom. I emailed Tristan the manager to let him know what had happened and pointed out that the situation could have been very dangerous for someone with an allergy. He called me back minutes later with a very sincere apology and a promise to do some retraining with the prep staff. He also reimbursed me for the meal and gave me a very generous gift card. You don't see service like this very often. I was so impressed with how Tristan handled his stores bumpy day.",

However, I've had the same exact scenario happen twice with this location.   I stop by on my way home from work after an exhausting day. I order a Caesar salad without mushrooms and add chicken ($2.69 extra) to go. This part might be my own fault, but in my exhaustion, I forgot both times to double check my order and both times, I have arrived home and... No chicken.   So I have now paid somewhere around $9 two times for a regular old Caesar salad without the chicken I paid for. I'm too tired to drive back in rush hour traffic and now I must cook some protein at home, which defeats the purpose of getting take out.  Like I said, probably my own fault, but frustrating nonetheless.",

The place was packed, but there was no line at the counter. I had already scoped out the menu online and immediately ordered the chopped salad, and a chocolate chip cookie for my son. The cashier immediately offered us cups for water, too, which was appreciated. We were provided the cookie right away.  Then we had to find a place to sit. Yikes! There was one empty table in the whole place, but we snagged it. I was relieved that my food was out within five minutes. The salad is beautiful, and the dressing was quite good.   The two bread pieces served along with it were HUGE--I wrapped one in napkins to eat later. I bake all my own bread and am something of a bread snob, so I can say with confidence that their artisan bread is absolutely delicious. It's the real deal.  Meanwhile, my son gobbled up his cookie. It was the size of a small saucer!  I was very pleased with this restaurant and I hope to visit their location that's much closer to where I live on the west side.",

My sister ordered a BLT and salad which looked good until she opened the sandwich to two tiny strips of bacon lost in the giant and multiple pieces of other items. I ordered the cheese ravioli which tasted great but the portions for the price I'm paying is way off. I shouldn't be paying $10+ for barely a handful of pasta and double the sauce.  I just really would love to see some improvement before my return to this location.",

Delicious iced tea, banana walnut pancakes, pastries to die for, toffee cake, lovely caesar salad that is very non-boring for a caesar, shortbread cookies Scotland would be proud of and bloody awesome pesto pasta (all their pasta is great).",

Try the two-egg with rosemary-crusted hash browns and fresh-baked toast, but add a short-stack of traditional pancakes. They're the best in town! Lunch is great too with tons of fresh sandwiches, salads and soups to choose from. The green corn chowder and french onion soups are a must. This place is small. If you're headed out on a weekend morning and afraid of crowds try the Chandler Mall location, equally as crowded but much larger. Bon appetit!",

Their maple syrup is terrific. Like their bacon, too.  Usually get meals to go though on occasion have dined in at both the Tempe and Gilbert locations, and then enjoy their coffee. Nice to go early Sat/Sun before the crowd arrives; breakfast served till 2pm on weekends.  Later that morning: Just got home from WBC in Gilbert. My own review made me hungry. Now enjoying the stuffed french toast as I write this...Yum.",

    "text": "I used to be obsessed with this place, and I still kind of am, but my last few visits were subpar. The atmosphere is always lively and it is usually busy when I go, which is fine for the delicious food I usually get. However, the last few visits I have wanted nothing more than a bread bowl with some basic soup (chicken noodle, tomato, cheddar and broccoli, etc) but out of the four soups of the day, nothing sounded remotely good to me. The last time I went I ordered the roasted sweet potato sandwich, which I thought was pretty gross, and since nobody comes to check on you, I had noone to complain to, so instead I ordered another meal, can't remember which, but I liked it. I really do love this place and will probably not stop coming back - their bread is especially delicious. And the cupcakes? The best around - better than specialized cupcake places. I also love that it is connected to Changing Hands Bookstore. It was just a couple of less than great visits that make me knock this place down a star.",

It was nice to go to a restaurant away from the busy ASU campus area.  It was the first restaurant meal that we had that tasted like home cooking, and fantastic home cooking at that!  I had the Almond tuna sandwich and split pea soup.  It was delightful and I would go back again in a heartbeat whenever we are in that part of the world.    Try the blackberry orange lemonade: so refreshing on a hot Arizona day.  Oh the service was very nice.  Everyone we interacted with was extremely courteous and friendly.  We also ended up purchasing a gift card to send to some of our local friends down in AZ.",

    "text": "Wildflower is OK for their food.  Nothing special about it, but it isn't bad either.  There are two main problems with the restaurant.  First the place is always crowded.  I'm not sure if this is because of its location next to Changing Hands or not, but usually weekends are impossible to get a clean table (if one at all).  This Wildflower seems smaller than most I've seen so it could be a local thing with this store.  Second, the crowd that eats there would seem more at home in North Scottsdale than South Tempe.  Personally I would have liked to see something more eclectic next to Changing Hands, but Wildflower is good enough for weekend brunch with your Grandma.",

My daughter and I pulled into the parking lot and it was a zoo!  Between the book store, Trader Joe's and Steinmart located in the same strip mall I was thinking we would never find a spot....however, the parking gods smiled upon us and we found something within 5 minutes of pulling in the lot.  The place was busy but the line moved quickly.  I ordered an Oriental Chicken Salad and a bowl Potato Cream Cheese soup.  Both the salad and the soup came with crusty slices of bread, great for dipping in the soup.  Everything was great.  The salad was fresh and crisp and the dressing was the perfect amount.  The soup...well what could be bad about potato cream cheese??  It was delish!!  My daughter got a half sandwich and a chocolate chip cookie that she gave a big thumbs up to after she devoured it.  We picked up a Gingerbread Santa cookie to snack on later.  It had good flavor but was a tad on the stale side.  Would I go back?  You bet!  The soup and salad alone was awesome and I'd like to try more of their baked goods.  I think I'm having a salad craving as I write this....hmmm......maybe I'll go tomorrow........",
