    "text": "Bold flavors, super fresh ingredients, and VERY friendly employees. This place is like Chipotle for Mediterranean food, without the chain restaurant feel. We stopped here after arriving at PHX and picking up our rental car at the Enterprise right down the street. We were totally starving and Yelp saved the day! We must have looked a little lost when we walked in because an employee immediately offered to walk us through the process. I ordered a bowl with saffron rice, gyro meat, roasted red pepper hummus, lentils, and lots of fresh veggies. It was absolutely delicious. And there was a check-in offer for one of their fresh brewed teas - score! All in all, this place deserves 5 stars. I would seriously eat at Hummus Xpress multiple times a week if I lived in the area.",

Also, while I dont eat it, the meat looks great and I saw them butchering it themselves in the back.  The chef explained that they cook it overnight at a low temperature...sounded and looked delicious.  This is also a solid spot for the vegetarians here.  Lot of options, and a lot of food-you will not leave hungry.  The reason its 4 and not 5 stars is simple: I would prefer them to give the customer the option of putting all of the different foods in seperate containers instead of meshing them alltogether in one bowl.  I would prefer to be able to taste the hummus, tzaziki, tahini, etc all seperately as they are delicious in their own right.  As it stands now, they serve it all together in one bowl and tastes fine, but you cannot differentiate between all of their different foods.",

Ever since making the switch to vegan after already being gluten-free, finding something good to eat that is also convenient has been a challenge!  The name alone was enough to convince me that I should try it out and I was pleasantly surprised to find that almost everything is gluten-free and most everything (other than the meat, of course) was also vegan!  I had a bowl with veggies, hummus and salad and it was delicious!  Not to mention everyone working was super friendly and helpful!  There was even live music during lunch!  What a cool spot.

Very much as everyone has reported previously it's a Mediterranean Chipotle, but better.  It's a small place in an older strip mall but nice inside. You get a choice of everything. I ordered a bowl with the most beautifully marinated, tender chicken, grilled zucchini, cooked kale, a quinoa salad with garbanzos in lemony dressing, jalapeno and cilantro hummus, extra toppings and a whole wheat pita. So much food but healthy. A lot of garlic which I'm sure all of my co-workers appreciated since I ate it at my desk. But I'm fairly sure they were just jealous they weren't eating it. All this for about $8.  Highly recommend.",

I've been wanting to try out the restaurant  for awhile after seeing it featured in the New Times, but I rarely find myself in Tempe. I ended up taking my parents there before seeing a show at Gammage. We all left very full and happy.  The owner explained all the menu and all the offerings for the day. I got a falafel plate which was a ton of food. It comes with one veggie side, but the owner threw in a few bites of all of them so I could try them out. The falafel was fantastic, and I fell instantly in love with the spicy carrots. I got the lemon ginger and beet hummuses since those were the most unusual sounding. They were both super good, and more unique than the standard hummus I make at home.  My parents were happy with their meat based dishes. I thought it was interesting that one of the choices was brisket. Unexpected for a mediterranean place, but that's the beauty of Hummus Xpress.",

    "text": "Excellent Fast/Casual Middle Eastern Style Food featuring a variety of unique Hummus and many interesting toppings.   It is a little confusing on how to order and is easier to understand when you read the website. The Main Menu is $6.45-$9.95.   Your best option for sampling the most amount of offerings is \"the plate\" so I went for that. I walked in front of the glass front buffet and the helpful people behind the glass served.   When you get \"The Plate\" They start with a really delicious Rice. You get TWO Protein Options. I went for the Flavorful Moist Brisket and the Lebanese Falafels. Since I got the brisket the Chef recommended a little Beef sauce over my rice and it was a really great suggestion. Then I got TWO vegetables Sides, yummy spicy carrots and crisp lemon broccoli. Next came Hummus and you either get one king or they split it and you get two. With all the flavors they offer I suggest getting two as I had the Beet root Hummus and the Original. You then get a salad choice and I picked Tabbouleh.  Believe it or not your not done yet.  Next are a large variety of pans of all kinds of vegetables and condiments and sauces and you pick whatever you like and get a pita too.  I picked Pickled Beets and some kind of Onion dish and really delicious Schug Sauce.  Now I'm at the end of the line and pay. Get my Cup for beverage and seat myself.  Everything was so delicious. I never had a Lebanese Style Falafel before and it seemed very different but also very good. The beef I tried was moist and flavorful and not too fatty. The rice was really, Really Good. I thought the carrots were super yummy. The pickled beets were almost crunchy with a really interesting flavor. Of course the Hummus was very good and that Schug Sauce was very aromatic and delicious. The shrug sauce had some kick to it but is a milder more herbal version of others I've tasted before but was certainly just as delicious.  Very Above Average Middle Eastern Style Food in a very casual and quick atmosphere.   4.5 Stars  P.S. No I wasn't able to finish my plate and took 1/2 home for latter.",

Doesn't bother me! Hummus was very delicious. Different than others around. I need to get more so I can put my finger on it. The jalapeno hummus was actually spicy which I've never had before. Other places just don't add enough I guess lol The eggplant was tough and tasted like it was out for awhile so I'll probably skip that next time (I came in at noon so not sure why so stale? ). The pita was very elastic and glutenous which I did not care for but it's not important for a plate. Didn't need it but I would've loved a more bready pita that's just my taste though. space is small and parking limited so plan accordingly.  Employees were efficient and friendly.

    "text": "This was my first time going here. Being stuck at a hotel all week long I wanted to try something different. I basically found this thru Yelp and the reason I went was because of the good reviews they had.  Service: The guys there were really friendly and guided me thru the choosing process. Food: It was great, I had the small bowl but it was enough to fill me up. Chicken had a good flavor, rice was delicious. Every bite that I took was full of flavor. If u like Spicy food the Jalapeno hummus is delicious. Lentils and garbanzos were good as well as the brocoli. Price: affordable I only paid $8.71 for the small bowl Cons: didnt really like the garlic sauce but then again not a big fan of garlic. The sweet tea looked old. (Only reasons I gave it a 4 star, I really wanted to get my free house brewed tea offered by Yelp).   Food is delicious I would go back.",

The side salad is worth the price and a good substitute if your going low calorie. The price is amazing for the amount of food you get. Unfortunately, i keep comparing it to Greek food in NYC, and it doesn't hold its own. Hence the 4 stars. Use ubereats, and have it delivered right to your place. It's a great dinner for one of those at home Netflix nights. If you want $10 off your order use my code eats-mbdvx.",

It's only a 5 min drive from my office and GOOD!!   We were going to get our lunches to go, because every table was occupied, but the stars were aligned and we got in the back bistro tables. Loud, very loud lunch crowd. Again, my ears are sensitive so the volume pains me and makes me rage, mean-mug the perps, and run outside. And choice of music was Country/Western in a Mediterranean/Middle Eastern fast food place? Errr... Nooooooo. Never, ever do that again, please. Not a fan of that genre but doesn't jive w the flavor of the joint. I need exotic sort of pop music from Lebanon or some shit...  The beautiful thing is that you build whatever you want to eat! It was a little daunting and laborious to use my brain during my lunch but I got in my flow. Tried the salad bowl with gyro meat, spicy hummus, grilled eggplant, and tzatziki sauce. Soooo wonderful; slightly different taste in every bite if you don't mix it, which is fun.  I ordered a piece of warm pita bread w salad but I think they should automatically throw this in for salad bowls... Don't you?? Haha  I'll return very soon for more dining experiences!",

Went in and the gentlemen working the counter were very nice and explained how everything worked and made some suggestions. I was already planning on a gyro so I went with that.   The pita was very good and ended up being the best part of the meal. The meat was swimming in oil/grease to the point where it was hard to choke down. The flavor was ok, but they were thick hunks that seemed like they were fried in oil to make them crispy. I generally prefer a more shaved gyro but my issue is more with all the grease pouring off the meat. The tzatziki sauce was very bitter and they used a ton of it. It was like having tzatziki meat soup served on a pita. I actually ended up scraping most of it off. It also didn't sit with me very well after the fact. I can't imagine I'll be back but based on all the good reviews, maybe it was just an off day.",

The \"classic hummus\" is not the same as traditional hummus; their classic contains garlic and has more of a chunky consistancy rather than thick and smooth. Overall, it was ok, but I will stick to the more traditional Mediterranean restaurants.",

Luckily my boyfriend and I both got dinner so it was okay - haha!  But besides sweating garlic I really liked this place. I love the Chipotle-style way of doing the food. I got a bowl with rice, beef, carrots, quinoa salad, classic hummus and tahini sauce. Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Some of the beef pieces were a tad on the dry side but overall it was good. Maybe it had been sitting a while? Also, the tatziki sauce was too strong for my taste so I would skip that next time. It's a lot of food. I ate half and was full so if you're like me you can easily get two meals out of a bowl.  Boyfriend has been looking for good falafel for a while now and he said it was very good. It must have been because he ate it all before I could try any!  The guys working behind the counter were really nice too. They were very patient and explained everything to us noobs.

We were cruising by the choices on Broadway and saw \"HUMMUS\" on the strip mall store. That made me curious. So, we adventured into the restaurant to give it a try. Very worthwhile!  Whether you are a vegan, vegetarian or meat eater, you will find something you love here. The staff was very engaging, friendly and helpful. It took a few minutes to wrap our heads around how the choices work. You can engineer your own great meal, picking and choosing by sight what you want.  One thing: if you like falafel, try it here! It was some of the best. And I used to eat it when I traveled in the Middle East. Gary and I shared the largest plate and had a blast trying this and that, and adding this topping and that topping. The eggplant was pretty darn yummy, too.  Go in with a sense of adventure, and try the offerings. Try new tastes and open up your world to new flavors and textures. This type of food is very healthy. It was a fun dining experience and I wish Hummus were in Tucson. I'd be a regular!",

The seasoned rice (yes, I forgot what it is called) is amazing and for vegetarians there is a bevy of no-meat options. I did try the gyros meet with the dinner size option but the grilled eggplant is also quite good. They also have a seasonal veggie option and the day I went it was rainbow kale - kale, how cool is that one folks!  I plan to go back and update my review after a few times but right now I would say this is a culinary gem located, as Juan B notes, in a strip mall, but that is sometimes where you find the best eating experiences, right?

I ordered the gyro bowl but am trying to do low carb right now so I got it without the rice. To my surprise it also came with a piece of pita bread. Well of course I ate that because I am not going to say no to pita if it is right in front of me. Overall the meat and veggies tasted great; I really loved that each had it's own unique flavoring. I ordered the eggplant and carrots for my two veggie options but he offered to give me a third since they were hardly any carrots left so I also got kale. Unfortunately the kale was a bit watery, even though it tasted amazing, and so that sort of diluted the hummus. So the consistency was a bit off but the red pepper hummus was still delicious. I really enjoyed my meal and I hope that the truck comes back again.",

    "text": "Mediterranean food is almost binary. Its either great or its terrible. After having had some really amazing experiences at other places, it feels a little harsh to dig into Hummus express, but there's so many ways that it felt uninspiring. Its definitely got potential, but it falls short in too many places. The customer service is good, and they have some good toppings and sauces, but you're limited to just 1 sauce. The meat is hit or miss depending on what you get.  If I'm getting a platter/plate, I safely assume that the rice that is served should be decent. How a Mediterranean food restaurant fails to execute rice is beyond my belief. At 6 pm, you can't blame the lack of customers for rice that seemed not only stale but completely overcooked. It looked like couscous, but tasted mushy like mashed potatoes. The chicken was decent, and the gyro actually had great taste and texture. However, the braised beef reminded me of a bland pot roast that was undercooked leaving it tough and chewy. I thought it was peculiar this was even an item at this place, but I would definitely stay away from that one.   There's plenty of fresh, high-quality toppings to choose from, but they are a little stingy with them. You get a very small pinch of each thing making it similar to a sampler. The eggplant tastes great and was one of the few toppings they didn't hold back on. Meanwhile though, the sauces were plagued by the same thing exhibited by the toppings. I don't quite understand why you're limited to one sauce when most other places let you try as many as you want, within reason of course.  At the moment, I can't really recommend this place. Its good, but has far too many holes to patch up. The service is excellent, and I'm sure they'll turn it around. I just don't think it fits my tastes.",

I went with most of her recommendations (aleppo beef, jalapeno/cilantro hummus, cauliflower, etc.) and for the most part it was delicious. The piping hot pita bread (choice of regular or whole wheat) was awesome too!   My only complaint was that the beef seemed to be mostly fat, although it was seasoned nicely.

The whole thing turned out amazing. You can ask for sauces and rice on the side. A bonus to this place is the free iced tea check in offer.

    "text": "Me and my boyfriend are avid hummus fans and have thus made it our mission to try hummus at every restaurant we can. This place is freaking amazing. Everything is delicious and full of flavor.   Now, this place definitely has some inefficiency issues, especially when it comes to making the pita. There point of sale system is also kind of slow (and I have my suspicious about the staff).  This can be upsetting when getting to-go orders as it effects the temperature of the food. But this is my only complaint and will certainly not keep me from coming here.   Their set up is that of a chipotle style, they press the pita at the beginning (or at least that is the intention, if you get something with pita on the side, they wait until the end which slows down the process) and you pick your sides, meat, hummus and toppings. Everything ends up being kinda mixed together but is still good. I even liked the rice, which I don't typically like but I'm having suspicions that I just inherently like Mediterranean style rice.   *Gyro meat- great Falafel - pretty good  *potatoes - fantastic *Jalapeno/Cilantro hummus - amazeballs, very spicy *Classic hummus - Great ( I like it topped with onion, pickles and tomatoes) Rice - delicious Lemon-garlic hummus - a little spicy but pretty good chipotle hummus- pretty good *chili .. something sauce - spicy and delicious tzaiki - great  *favorite items  ***forgive spelling, since I'm writing this review in lieu of doing my homework, I'm not gonna take the extra time to look them up",

    "text": "It's hard to add much more than what is already written for this restaurant, which properly backs up the high 4+ star rating (as of this review).   The owner/chef definitely cares about his food, the quality is high, the recipes amazing (the best roasted eggplant I had ever had) and the food a darn good value.     Although I won't deduct any stars because from a food standpoint it was so good, I would suggest the following:  1.  Great concept - and well explained on the website, but the limited chalkboard menu above the food line doesn't make it abundantly clear what your options are (such as an extra veggie costing more - and if so, how much?  2.  Consider a side of hummous w/out the meat/fill-in or falaffel.  Maybe a small side to accompany a pita for 2 bucks or so.  The regular hummous I tried was amazing.  I'd gladly order a pita and then add a side to that order.  3.  Expand to the west side!  This is a great restaurant and concept - I passed by as I work not too far, but won't forever.  I will definitely miss this place when that day comes.",

I hadn't ever been here before, but if I lived or worked in this area I'd be a regular.  The menu was a bit confusing but essentially you choose a meat, rice, hummus and other toppings. The Yelp check in bonus was a free iced tea. The serving sizes were generous enough that I couldn't finish it all for lunch, and all of the flavors went together really well. Plenty of vegetarian and low carb options since you could trade something out for the meat or rice portions of the dish.  Staff was friendly and helpful even with a busy lunchtime crowd. I needed sugar for my tea since there wasn't any at the beverage station and someone ran into the back to get me some. Unfortunately, he came back with salt, which I dumped in and then nearly gagged at. Second time was the charm though, and the tea was great.",

Hummus express is a fast food place.. but not only do I like the food, I love the concept and the attitude of the employees.   So I was going to a barbecue and wanted to bring some hummus. Now, I could have made it myself - but mine isn't as experimentally fantastic as what they make here. Ginger-Lemon Hummus sounds wacky, but it is so obscenely divine that one needs to test it. And talking about faith in your product when you can sample everything before you buy it.   So I bought some hummus... only the hummus, even if the guys behind the counter told me how I could walk out with more stuff for less money if I followed their lead - but I didn't have to. Instead they gave me hummus, and I paid. WIn-WIn.  I wish there was a way I could convey how awesome i believe this place to be - it will not suit everyone, but give it a shot. Give it a lunch.. its like $6. You could get hooked like me, or you could let the world know that you are not a connoisseur of fine experimental food, but a boring old meanie-face that smells of Chicken McNuggets.  If you do take my advice, drop my name.. and they will have absolutely no idea who I am ;)   - A 6th star for the attitude of the employees.",

All the flavors are vey strong and bold. If you get the bowl, try everything separately before mixing it all together. The cilantro jalapeno hummus has a nice bite, and the chipotle hummus is great as well.  Overall, the food was very tasty and the prices were very affordable for the quality and amount of food given.

    "text": "Great food, simple setup, I love this place!  I discovered this place based on Yelp reviews less than 2 weeks ago, and I've already made it there a total of 3 times. This place is that good! Although I don't really care for the comparison to Chipotle in any way, they themselves describe themselves as being like Chipotle in that you get up in the line and pick out items along the way (i.e., meat, salad, veggies, etc.). There are enough choices here that the variety is practically endless.  So far, I've gotten the bowl 3 times. I've had chicken every time (I'll change that at some point). I've tried the broccoli, carrots (fantastic!), and kale--all are good. I've tried 3 of the types of hummus--cilantro jalapeno, red pepper, and one other that I can't remember right now--again, they're all excellent, and I look forward to trying the other 3. There is a variety of veggies you can put on top. Everything is fresh, and the jalapenos are always spicy. There are 5 different sauces, and the ones I've tried so far are delicious. Finally, the bowl comes with rice and a pita (white or wheat) if you so choose.  There are also pita, salad, and plate options, but the bowl has worked out so well so far that I haven't felt the need to try anything else. Along with one of the empanadas they've had available (spinach or cheese), I've had plenty of food every time I've gone.  This place really is great. I'll be a regular here.",

The two dudes that were working were super nice and super helpful.  It was my first time so they let me try a couple things and gave me advice on what was best.  Ready for this: I ended up getting a bowl with rice, fried eggplant, some sort of broccoli, chicken, lentil kale salad, red onion, tomato, a little bit of tzatziki and jalapeno cilantro hummus.  With a wheat pita on the side.  It was nothing like I expected but oh my god it was absolutely amazing.  All of the flavors just meshed together.  You taste a little bit of everything, but it's almost like you don't taste anything separate.  You just taste one big bowl of all these different flavors formed into one.  Words really don't do this place justice.     The one thing I will say is don't be scared to do something a little out of your comfort zone.  I told them I don't like eggplant, they had me try it and it was the best eggplant I've ever had.  Some of the stuff they have there might seem a little out there, especially for someone like me who has a very American pallet.  Don't let that scare you and trust the people that work there.  If you aren't afraid of something a little exotic, you HAVE to go here.  If you are a little afraid of exotic, you HAVE to go here.    This is one of those places where you just can't go wrong.",

Good for vegans and meat eaters,  they have plenty for both.",

I've had falafels and baklavas at numerous restaurants, festivals and places and I've never- NEVER- had anything CLOSE to the ones I've had here! A falafel full of flavor and the perfect amount to moisture and crunch that just takes you to another place in time. A baklava bar that when you bite into it, the buttery flakes fall perfectly into your mouth as you bite cleanly through each honey and pistachio flavored layer. Not one flavor over powered the other but married and became one to give the most decadent experience. I've never had a good falafel nor baklava except here! Truly amazing food from the hummus to the pita.   I can't even explain about the flavor and quality of everything else. If you want healthier, delicious food, this is it! This is it! Best place hands down!",

Hummus needs more flavor and it's super thin! I think they are watering it down to make it last longer. Tzatziki sauce is ok, but pretty watered down as well.

Hummus Xpress offers fast, fresh options that are a lot healthier than what you'd normally consider as \"fast food.\" You start with your choice of wrapping or container such as pita, bowl, or plate. You get seasoned rice automatically with your order, and can then choose your meaty protein, falafel, or go veg where you can double up on each section. There are various delicious vegetables to choose from, several hummus flavors, salads, and a last section of condiments and sauce to finish your creation.  I opted for a vegetarian bowl with grilled eggplant, ginger carrots, beet and classic hummus, lentil salad, white bean salad, marinated onion with carrot, chickpeas, and garlic aioli to top it off. Quite a lot of food for a bowl! Each component was full flavored and went well with each other. My favorites of the bowl were the ginger carrots, eggplant, and beet hummus. As a side note, be aware that the garlic aioli is delicious but is made with raw garlic so you will have stinky dragonfire breath if you get it :).  Service was very friendly and cheerful. The space is small so it might be cramped if you go with a large group.   Overall I love the concept and the food is fresh, fast, and flavorful. I'll definitely be back again!",

I could tell that some of the items had been sitting out for a while. But I do not fault them for it. Why? Because it was completely dead inside. According to the owner/chef, they are extremely busy during lunch hours, but traffic slows down severely around dinnertime. Given that, they at least had every advertised item available, and most of it looked and tasted fresh.  So come on, people. Try this place for dinner sometime.

I ordered that last night and it was delicious.  the broccoli is my favorite.  it's one of those places where you can eat vegetarian and not feel deprived afterwards or hungry again 1 hour later....",

For about 2 months, I intended to try it. Today, I finally took the plunge and walked in not knowing what to expect.   The place is small, and there were only about 4 people sitting at tables, even though there were 3 people working behind the counter. The place is set up kinda like a Chipotle or a Qdoba - you pick the type of meal you want, and right in front of you are all the different options to include.   I choose a bowl and filled it with both types of rice, chicken, grilled eggplant, red pepper hummus, lettuce, tomatoes, green onions, and feta. It also came with my choice of a regular pita or a whole wheat pita. Everything looked amazing! Upon my first bites I discovered it TASTED amazing. Everything was good on it's own, and it was every better when I started mixing it all together. I devoured the whole thing. It is very easy to eat healthy here, since everything is so fresh and so tasty.   I strongly urge everyone to try this place -- they need to stay open so I can solidify it as my regular lunch spot.   The customer service was superb too -- they explained to me how the meals worked and even let me try the hummus since I must have looked distraught over having too many options.   My bowl and my pita rang in for less than $8. Fantastic!",

Right when we got there, the two men behind the counter were very nice and welcoming. The heat though, was not welcoming. We chose to get our food to go because there was no way we could sit in that room to enjoy our meal.  Anyways, the guys made our meal easy to choose from all the choices and were very helpful as we were first timers. If you can, get the tea. I think I enjoyed that more than the actual meal. Great service, and I can see good for others, just not my thing I don't think.",

Just like every other review said before this one, the concept is like a chipotle but with Middle Eastern ingredients. I got as much as I could fit in the plate of awesomeness to include: rice, gyro meat, roasted eggplant, carrots, chipotle hummus, tabouli salad, tzatziki, lettuce and shug (many different spellings of this word). Also, a choice of wheat or white pita was also included. Overall the food was good and I would definitely come back to have some more. The only negative that happened was that they ran out of tahini sauce. Not the biggest deal, but Mediterranean food would be complete without it. Hopefully this place will be able to expand to other locations.",

Beet hummus and cilantro/jalapeno are probably my faves together. Stack it piled with veggies, rice, choice of meat, type of salad, additional toppings and ta-da - a masterful meal to enjoy!

    "text": "This is probably one of the weirder reviews I'll ever write. When I rate something 5 stars, not only does the food have to be hallucination-inducing, uncontrollably drooling awesome, but so does the service itself. In this case, the service pretty much is non-existent and confusing to the core but they have me whipped, chained, and weak at the knees for their food.   Eddie owns the place and he's pretty awesome at what he does. The flavors are so intense and so on point but not only that, they're kind of visually stunning as well. Be mesmerized by how intensely pink the beet hummus is or be nervous when you see how many fresh green jalapeno specks there are in the cilantro hummus. Their rice is a beautiful saffron golden color and always fluffy like a pillow. Their meats, especially their lamb and beef ... would you like some meat with your steamy meat juices? Because that's how succulent they are. Everything is just an explosion of flavor because of how many herbs and spices they use in each dish. I will warn you that by eating their potatoes, you should plan on not speaking to anyone for the next 8 hours because it is just deliciously bombarded with an obnoxious amount of garlic.   I order catering all the time for my workplace and the moment the work floor get an email that there's Hummus Xpress - they drop everything for it. These full grown men are willing to sit still through a 45-minute vendor presentation that probably doesn't even relate to what they do just to be able to enjoy the food rather than go out for lunch themselves. In our world, that's some major dedication.   Service? Let's just say it's been a trip. Sometimes when I call to order, their phone line doesn't work and they just don't fix it - just because. So then you're stuck for 3 months having to resort to ordering something else while you live on edge that your insatiable coworkers might jump you. Finally get a hold of them? Kitchen fire - closed. Need a catering order? E-mail it and hope that they show up at the time you requested because they never responded or asked for payment. Get the receipt - not even sure what they charged you for but it looks about right because you're too busy already stuffing your face. I'm sure it's different when you're there in person, but no matter how many obstacles they throw my way to make it seem like they don't want my business at all, I still keep vying for their attention like some crazy pre-teen Justin Bieber fan.",

I got the pita ($7) with rice, chicken, zucchini, jalapeno cilantro hummus, olives, cucumbers, tomatoes, cheese, and peppers, with garlic aioli sauce. Perfect price for a lot of food! The only downside is that I don't live close enough to come on a regular basis, but I did see that they have a food truck! Employees are also very friendly and were remembering other people's previous orders.",

Very messy and quickly thrown together, rubbery chicken that wasn't well seasoned (pretty sure it came from a can), mushy carrots, and I couldn't even find the hummus and rice. I'll chalk it up to them not being prepared for a large lunch rush, but they didn't serve anything that would make me a returning customer. Disappointing dish after waiting so long in line.",

    "text": "Actually, Middle Eastern food is one of our favorites, and we will probably be back -- if we happen to pass by at lunch time, and we are hungry.  But there is nothing about Hummus Xpress that would make it worth a trip.  Like the others of its genre, epitomized by Chipotle Mexican Grill, Hummus Xpress allows you to choose from four presentations (basically the container you want the food served in), four proteins, and various sides.  They build your meal in your container, you pay at the register, find a table, and sit down to enjoy -- well, to enjoy some of it.  The location is small and basic, which is okay, but what is not okay is problems with the food.  The gyro meat, for example, was far too thickly cut so that it did not get that crispy caramelized crust on the outside, and it was luke warm.  The spicy carrots were unevenly cooked, with many pieces raw and others mushy.  The signature hummus was nowhere near as good as the Sabra variety you can buy at a grocery store.  And the pita was dull, cold, and generally substandard.  Some items were quite good, however, such as the braised beef (brisket), kale salad and rice.    But taken on balance, the food is just average.  Hummus Xpress does not rate four or five stars, no matter what standard you judge it by.",

Needs to be more clear about how many of what you can get from each section. My girl got 2 and I got 1 but we paid the same. Also they need more seasoning in the chicken. No salt whatsoever.  - One spoon of meat? Really for $7-$9 you give one spoon of meat? First time i went in there i got 2 spoons. There need to be consistency with meat portions. I feel like I'm getting robbed depending on whoever is working at that moment gives you the portion he thinks is appropriate for you.  -I dont know how long this place has been open for but they definitely need to clean this place up. The booths are ripped and dirty, should be aligned with the wall instead of having it in the center. There was dirt all over the floor along with a screw on the floor where we were sitting.  - There was this loud vibrating sound coming from the soda machine all this time we were there. Very annoying. Fix it guys.  All in all its a group of young guys running this place including the owner and seems like they are on the right track with their friendly service and healthy food. Just clean it up a little bit and you have  my 5 stars.",

They cook it more authentic than other \"pita\" joints that just toss some kebab meat on a pita and call it a day. This is the only place that has awesome sides like tabouli salad and roasted eggplant that comes with your meal. They've been known to have live music and crazy business at lunch. Honestly, they have some of the best food and should get recognized for it!",

Ordered two plates to go with all of my favorites and must've guessed right for hubby because he devoured it when we got home and settled.   This is our favorite type of food to make, but soooooo much easier than buying, prepping and plating all of these amazing ingredients, having plenty leftover to enjoy tomorrow!!  Oh yeah, the eggplant is AMAZING!! I don't really care for eggplant, but several review comments made me give it a try... will definitely get that again when in the neighborhood.   The baklava was off the charts!! Flakey, buttery, honey-loving slices of heaven, and I know my baklava, baby!! YUM!",

As you go down the line with your order, different employees assemble your plate (kind of like Subway). Two of the three employees mumbled so much and were upset when I asked them to repeat themselves so I could hesr them over the exhaust fans behind them. If you don't know what you want right away, even though all the food options are spread down the counter and you have to go through the whole line to see the available options, you will get many sighs of frustration from the employees. Apart from the attitudes of most of the employees, the veggie options are great. I just wish the folks running the place would realize the impact a crappy attitude has on people paying for your services.",

I've scoured a free iced tea by checking in on Yelp. It was a pretty good tea too. The only thing I had a problem with was a small bowl and a slice of baklava over $12!

The wide-eyed look of confusion on my face alerted the employees that I was a newbie. Even though it was almost closing time they were super nice.   The employees kindly explained the whole process: the difference between sizes (bowl or plate), fillings (various hot veggies, hummus, and salads) toppings, and prices ($0.65 for additional fillings). They gave me a bunch of samples to help my indecision. Thankfully the store was pretty empty - I wouldn't suggest doing this during the lunchtime rush. There really are so many options to choose from spicy to sweet, savory, meaty or just veggies - it is totally customizable!   So I got ALL the things!! ... er, pretty close to All THE THINGS!   My favorites being the rice, the fried eggplant, and the lemon ginger hummus (though all the hummus has been delicious). I've been back a few times now since that first visit and each time I've ate the whole bowl in one sitting! Yup, it just that good.",

However, the last three times I've eaten here the eggplant has been over cooked and way over salted. I'm really disappointed as this was one of my favorite restaurants. It's a little pricey, and when you can't even eat all of your veggies because half of them taste like salty jerky, it's really not worth it.",

The lemon broccoli is probably the best broccoli I have ever had.  The tahini and garlic aoli sauces were divine.  I didn't particularly care for the recommended potato salad today but only because it was a flavor I'm not fond of, the quality and freshness was all there.    One complaint.  At the expense of sounding like an old fuddy duddy...while I was there for lunch they were blasting disco music so loud I could not hear the guy taking my order or have a decent conversation with my husband.  It was fine for a bar atmosphere but too loud for a Monday lunch date.    However, this will definitely be my weekly lunch spot for a while.",

The owner/CHEF Eddie is right there working hard.  It's like gourmet food to go.  He compared it as the Chipotle of Mediterranean cuisine, I agree but even more so. He told me how the pitas come from a local bakery fresh (can't remember name), and he was most exuberant describing everything.  There were a lot of choices and I didn't know where to start because I don't know this cuisine and Eddie was more than happy to put together a pita combination as he is a chef. He asked me if I wanted vegetarian or not and then he went down the line putting a combination together for me on the fly working with my preferences.  When I finally had my pita (see picture) the flavors were awesome! I was tasting something I could very happily eat in a sit down restaurant. I do not know where else you can get such a high quality food quickly and for a decent cost.",

I have to say, though, that while I admire the number of options offered here (many more than Chipotle itself), the food didn't taste particularly authentic to me.  I chose to forego meat for falafel, and this may have been my first mistake. The falafel I got lacked the satisfying crunch I look for, and was frankly pretty bland. The pita was lacking as well, and was more the texture of grocery store pita than proper pita, which is generally far less doughy. Honestly, I let the owner recommend most of the items I chose for the bowl, as I wanted to make sure they'd go together well. They didn't, and it tasted more like a random jumble of food than a Mediterranean meal. It was certainly an ok value for the price, but that doesn't mean much when it doesn't taste that good.",

They are super concerned about food costs and therefore quite inflexible about substitutions.

So I bought Hummus with fill ins i.e $3.99 and .67 on extra filling. So to plan on a budget of $5.50 I bought Hummus (Beet Flavor Hummus) with Saffron Rice, Eggplant, Olives, Feta Cheese. \"What a healthy meal Ahh\" .Food is delicious, fresh, higher quality food in good price. Totally worth it. If you are lucky you will receive nice greetings from Amad. His service is excellent and you will want to revisit for sure. I got the same food for \"To Go\" And sensible girl i.e Precious. is good and very nice too. I was taken away with Amad's service.  The $3.99 Deal is as follows: Pick 1 in each for any extra I think it is $ 0.67 more. 1.Types of Hummus : Beet Hummus, Classic Hummus,Chipotle Hummus, Basil Parsley Hummus, Arugla Hummus, Jalapeno Hummus, Ginger Hummus 2.Types of Fillings : Saffron Rice, Beans, Eggplant, Tofu, Carrots, Meats etc 3.Types of Salad: Tabouli Salad, Kale Salad, Kale with Wheat Salad 4.Types Of Salad( Single):  Tomatoes, Olives, Beetroots, Cucumbers, Jalapenos , Bell peppers, Spring onion green leaf rounds 5.Other Filling Types: Feta Cheese, and there were 4 More  And you get Free Pita (Wheat/White) Bread along with Hummus with Fillings. What more can you ask for ?  Overall very delicious and authentic food with excellent service.  Supper !!! We went at 2:15 afternoon.Wasn't much busy But on earlier visit was really really full house Usually 11 till 2 very busy. Not sure about evening as of now. Try and relish food. I am sure you will love the food.",

It really is like a Mediterranean Chipotle:  Pick your size, pick your rice, pick your veggies, pick your meat, pick more veggies, pick your hummus, pick your sauce.  It's awesome, very delicious, everything fresh.    Price is \"fair\".  Not expensive, not cheap.  Just fair.  My meal with a drink is like $10.  The owner/manager was also incredibly helpful in recommendations, descriptions, etc.  Great guy.  Even had a couple of kids playing sax/guitar a few times, if that's your thing.",

I was going to go to the juice bar next door but it turned out to be a diet/nutrition place with a membership requirement, so I started talking to Eddie at Hummus Xpress.  He was so incredibly personable and accommodating that I had to give his restaurant a shot.  Everything smelled amazing so it made it an easier decision.  First, let me reiterate....Eddie, the owner, is forthright, honest, and incredibly nice.  As previously mentioned, the concept is like a Mediterranean Chipotle with the difference being this is locally owned and sourced food with lots of organic, vegan friendly, and fresh food.  You pick your choice of bowl, plate, or pita and then add main meat or vegetable component, added toppings such as hummus(6 kinds made fresh daily), tabouli, etc.  From there, you pick topping of sauces, hot sauces, olives, tzatziki amd more.    Eddie will let you sample whatever you would like.  The gyro mean is so tasty but I rolled with the slow roasted braised beef.  All I can say is you must try this place, whether or not you are in the area.  It will be well worth your time.",

Hummus bowl (classic is still my favorite) with the beef (both out of this world) and a side of tabouli.  I am so happy they changed their tabouli to the traditional bulgur wheat.  A fantastic and healthy lunch for $6 (w/o drink).  Gyro meat is good too and all the add-ons make it a perfect fit for your taste buds.  The garlic aioli is a must try.

Favorites:   All of the Hummus's! They have flavored hummus that they rotate.  Everyone's fav cilantro jalepeno-a bit too spicy for me. My favorite is the Roasted beet hummus which has a beautiful hot pink color. They are so creative with their hummus!   Eggplant- roasted, creamy, complex and divine!    Roasted broccoli- flavorfully rich roasted goodness  Falaffel- soft fluffy insides with a crunchy exterior and unexpected hint of cardamom   Kale salad- fresh and zingy   $9 for a bowl filled to the brim with diverse veggie goodness.

Like other reviewers have posted, it's like chipotle but for Mediterranean food.  The food tastes great.  I tried the jalapeno hummus and was very pleased.  First time having kale in a gyro and it was very tasty.  Their tea is really good also.  They have mango, peach, and regular. This will be my go to place when I'm in town for business.  Update:  I just got a free baklava!  Flaky, sweet, buttery goodness.  Thank you!",

Im only comparing it to Chipotle due to the similarites as making your order and choosing what you would like. Fresh cooked veggies, variety in meat and hummus. You also get rice and toppings as well.   Easy quick dinner to pick up and take home and its very filling...and given that you pretty much cannot get anything that's unhealthy here you dont feel as guilty after you stuff your face and devour the whole bowl :)",

Unfortunately they put both scoops of hummus in the same container and due to their watery consistency it kinda turned into a soup/glop combination of the two after my car ride home. I would rather get my hummus from the grocery store, farmer market, or Haji Babba off McClintock in Tempe.",

    "text": "Hummus Xpress, welcome back. I've missed you. After my gripe about the salad incident, the owner made sure that things were figured out, can't knock that level of dedication to the customer. I want to be clear here, I had frequented the heck out of this place prior to that confusion. I had even gotten my coworkers hooked on it as well. I missed this place, and I am truly glad that all is back.   This place does make good, quick, and relatively healthy food. I could, and some weeks have,  eat the eggplant in excess. It's just so good. The falafel is delicious, and has the right consistency. Sometimes falafel gets dry, or too mushy; it's a tricky thing to tame for those that are comfortable with it. HX gets it right. Not a fan of the mighty chickpea? Try some of the Aleppo Beef. It is juicy and tender, and mixes with most of the other options. Their tabbouleh is also prime. It's the best tabbouleh I've had that wasn't homemade. Finally, it is really rare for me to find good schug in Tempe. It seems like most restaurants I visit stick to the standard spicy sauces that are essentially cayenne and vinegar. Schug is a flavorful addition to the condiment family. It packs a good punch though, so take warning. I pair it with the jalapeno hummus, but that is definitely not for all.     Welcome back to my regular consumption pattern.  I've missed you.",

I would typically not drive into this area, so don't let that scare you away!  The woman at the counter was very friendly. I informed her I was a new customer and she gave me the basic run down. I decided to get a jalapeno cilantro hummus pita. I added gyro meat and some veggies. It was delicious!!! I ate the entire thing! It was way more food than I needed, and it kept me full for hours!  My only complaint- It was a little messy, which I didn't like. It comes in a red plastic basket with a thin piece of wax paper. Since the pita was so messy, I had to use a knife and fork to eat it. The basket made this difficult. The paper ripped and exposed the basket. I would much prefer to eat off a plate.  Next time I will try a \"hummus bowl.\"  I definitely recommend you try this place out! I will definitely be back!",

It taste like they tried to get too fancy with the food but did not succeed in doing so. The topping they offer have too much going on and leave a weird after taste. They gyro meat is not traditional. It is thick and only somewhat taste like gyro meat. The hummus is ok but it has more liquid than most other hummus. It makes the pita soggy. The pita bread itself is store bought and nothing special about it. But what really moved me to write the review was that I found a hair in my food. I only ate 1/4 of it and was done.",

We were immediately greeted and served (in and out within about 5 minutes). I ordered the most delicious falafel bowl with rice, white bean salad, glazed carrots, onions, jalapeno and cilantro hummus, feta, and garlic aioli with a wheat pita. Holy flavor, Batman. Pro tip: you can get half and half of two different hummus types if you are indecisive like me. My fiance ordered a gyro on a pita with potatoes and tzatziki, which he happily devoured. It is not the easiest thing to eat while driving (we ended up just pulling over - it was that good) but it was a great way to kick off our road trip. If I was a local, you couldn't keep me away from this place. Can't wait to pass through Tempe again just to be able to come back!!",

They also have different types of hummus. Try the cilantro jalapeno - it's amazing (although my mom prefers the classic). The staff will guide you and help you choose items that go together.

You then add one of many veggie options like roasted potatoes or eggplant.  Choose one of many types of hummus (my favorite being cilantro jalapeno).  Next comes a salad option.  I love both the tabbouleh and the bean salad.  To top it all off, there are many topping options like feta, onions, cabbage, olives, lettuce, and a variety of others.

You could eat by yourself near the window sill/counter or sit at table/booth to chat with friends. The guy who works here was also really nice and patient with my order.

    "text": "A compact lunch spot that packs a punch!  I love this place, especially their hot veggies and protein.  I normally place an order for a bowl.  Once you decide on a protein, you fill it with a veggie (I love the eggplant), pick a hummus flavor (they have 4 to choose from) and a salad.  I usually end up ordering extra veggies and you'll pay extra for it.  Top it off with a sauce and you'll see your bowl filled up pretty quickly.  Very filling and yes, you will walk out with dragon breath but it's totally worth it.  Just make sure to pack some gum or mints.  For dessert, they offer baklava and cookies.  You'll walk out thinking why you didn't come sooner.    The place gets pretty busy at lunch but the line moves quickly so don't despair.  Parking is tight but totally worth it.  If the place runs out of seating, they will conveniently pack it to take back to work.  Go, what are you waiting for...GO!",

It doesn't matter where it is, what it looks like, if the service and food are top knotch, I'll go. I first tried hummus xpress when my gf brought home take out. It had been sitting for awhile and I was hungry but man was it good! It left such an impression I couldn't wait to visit in person. Since that day, I've been back only twice mainly because I don't live or work near the area but if I did, oh boy I'd need gift cards because I'd be there regularly. Everything I tried is insanely flavorful, so fresh, so good, the combinations are absolutely endless! It'll never get boring. Definitely recommend this place. Get a wrap, or a bowl, just go already. You won't be disappointed.",

Gave her my order (in the order and how I usually order) as I have done when I go in there myself. Very disappointed she came back with a \"bowl\" if I had to measure it probably had about a spoonful of rice, 3 not 4 olives hummus was in a small container . I would compare the size of a container to the container you receive at Cane's with their chicken dipping sauce. The falafel did not taste recently made but tasted like they been there for a while. In addition when it came to the hummus it tasted like the hummus was expired or maybe it was too much lemon/lime in it. Definitely not worth the $8.50 plus tax for a bowl. Will not be going back disappointed",

My personal favorites are the beet hummus, and the Jalapeno cilantro hummus.

I ordered a pita with grilled chicken, jalapeno hummus and kale.  I also ordered a side of falafel.  The pita was ok enough.. Nothing really special with it or the chicken.  It was nice to have kale, one of my favs, as a topping.  The falafel was brought out to my table and was really dark brown turning to blackish. I tried part of one and they were disgusting.  I took them back to the counter and being full from the pita, told the guy I didn't want anything else but they should be a bit more care because the falafel was way too fried.  He promptly told me I didn't know what I was talking about.  That he's from Lebanon and has eaten falafel his whole life.  I said it's still over fried.  He then ask me if I wanted him to give it to me raw because he could do that...I turned, said 'interesting customer service here' and left.  I'd never go back and would recommend you don't either.",

He grabbed plates and pitas with his bare hands, and the cashier had no gloves on. I watched the cashier touch money, touch food items, then touch money again. Luckily he didn't handle any of my food, I would have politely asked him to put gloves on. He did scoop a side of sauce for us sans gloves, he dipped his finger in the first cup, he tossed that one, scooped another and spilled it on his hand. He then went back to cashiering. This grosses me out to no end. So unsanitary. Please please please educate your employees on food handling!",

Two minor issues are - firstly that there are multiple attendants and sometimes the serving size really varies from bowl full to bowl 3/4 full. And secondly usage of same serving spoon/tongs for all meats is a bit of a growl for me - It doesn't bother me but I would prefer if serving spoon/tongs are kept separate. The attendants are very polite and nice and almost always wish you when you arrive and when you leave.",

    "text": "I want to preface my review with the fact that my Mediterranean knowledge is based on a handful of places in the valley; some better than others, (in my opinion).  At the risk of the yelp*ing community throwing themselves off Camelback mountain, I have to say that Pita jungle sort of sets the bar for me when it comes to overall taste, portion size, and quality.  Having said that, I was fortunate to try Hummus Xpress (hard to take the place serious with the name) this afternoon.  Based on the reviews alone, I was expecting a lot and was not disappointed. Live music, handful of tables, not much of a line and fairly straightforward system of ordering.  If you read more than two other reviews, I don't have to repeat the process.  It was nice to get some guidance from the line, though I was a little confused by the pricing aspect: .60 cents per item on veggies.  I wasn't clear if that was across the menu or just that region but I was so aware of it that it kept me from really wanting to pile on anymore than a single veggie.  Portion size was adequate, the bowl can hold a lot of food and you fill the bowl easily with delicious ingredients.  I sampled a few flavors of hummus and too be honest, I prefer my hummus warm which this was not but was still tasty.  What seems like a limited menu actually is fairly vast and it would be possible to have the same thing twice only by accident.  Pitas were soft and warm and the iced tea was special.  Push-button iced tea is an abomination so it was nice to see handwritten exotic flavors that didn't make you roll your eyes.  Hummus Xpress (*sigh) is now in the rotation and on the board for a good quality lunch.",

You can get a pita, salad or bowl and fix it up the way you want- sort of like Chipotle or Cafe Rio. Everything I tried was outstanding. I had two kinds of hummus- beet and cilantro. The star for me was beet. It was slightly sweet and so pretty on the plate- neon pink!  The chicken was tender and flavorful and the bowl had saffron rice which was also a delight. The tzatziki sauce had a slight spicy kick which I've never had, but ended up really enjoying as well.   The owner was working the counter and he was so nice. I really hope this place does well.   I'll be back for sure!!",

You start with a plate, a bowl, or a pita, then pick a meat (or an non-meat, or no meat), some veggies (lots of choices), some hummus (or not) and then a salad and rice (or not), and then maybe a sauce (or not).  Do it yourself--get a lot of a little or a little of a lot--however you want it.  There's always many choices.  Their hummus is shot through with kale and cilantro--enough to add greens and a little spice, but not too much.  Falafel?  Fala-full of flavor.  Nothing is pre-made, EVERYTHING is fresh.  Great taste, great price, nice and fast, extreme service.  Good for lunch or dinner or a snack.  Veggie friendly.  Work nearby? Lunch.  Live nearby?  They deliver.  Do it.",

You do order from right to left, you get to pick your rice, meat and veggie, hummus and as many toppings as you would like (like olives, and, other things... yeah, I was only interested in the olives)   I was actually expecting the food not to be too fresh since it's basically served buffet style, but it was surprisingly fresh and perfect! I had the gyro meat and I honestly think it's the best gyro meat I've had in Tempe so far. Super moist and flavorful and it didn't give me indigestion! The hummus was really good, I had the plain one (If someone can't make plain hummus right, then there is no point in trying the flavored ones) It was good!!! I asked if it was made in house or bought, they told me everything is made in house.  Even the drinks were exciting! I had lavender-peach tea. It was fresh and I loved that it wasn't sweetened. Don't forget to check in and get a free tea!   This will definitely be a regular lunch spot for me....how can you beat cheap, fresh and delicious?",

Not to worry though, the manger was very helpful in breaking it all down.   We ordered a lot of food, pretty much min one of everything and doubled up on a few others. We had lamb, and chicken and falafel, and 6 kinds of hummus, and sauces galore. They delivered right on time, helped me get everything set up, they provided all the utensils and plates, and were very nice. Everything tasted super fresh and I am pretty sure we ate happily for at least two days.   I have yet to stop in to the location for a single meal, but next time I am in the area I will surely try.

I can't eat dairy so it was concerning to me they may not have read my request at all.   I ate it and if there was dairy I'll know soon. It's disappointing to have your order messed up especially since you wait 60 mins to get it.  I had it delivered  via grub hub, it was about 2 miles away.

    "text": "My husband won't stop talking about this place, I finally put my foot down and said I'm going in!!! Little did I know I would end up falling in love with the hummus Xpress!!!   It's such a cute place, I'm loving the decor, not too crowded and it gives almost a relaxing feel from the hot blazing sun outside!  If you've ever been to chipotle you'll notice it's almost the same concept! The customer service is amazing! The moment we walked in, we were greet and the man was so eager to assist us. You know how you can tell when someone is confident in their food, well we certainly saw it from the gentleman helping us! He took the time to explain how it worked and then we were off on our hummus Xpress!!  We both ended up with a bowl, the chicken was amazing, tender and very seasoned! The hummus was fresh and the eggplants delicious!!!! You wouldn't think there was a lot of food until you actually sat down and started eating it! It was so filling!!   If you check in with yelp I did see they were offering a free sweet tea drink! I'm so happy I grabbed one of the walnut baklva!! Oh my Buddha!! This was the most amazing dessert I've ever had! Next time I'm not sharing and getting my own!   No wonder my husband raves about this food truck! The prices are fair for what you get! It's amazing! I recommend you give them a try! Not only is it tasty but it is also very healthy as well!!   I've never had a good good Mediterranean dish until now! Thanks hummus Xpress (^_^) I'll be back for sure!!!   P.s they do not open on Sundays, so if you enjoy chick fila or hummus Xpress avoid Sundays",

I got roasted eggplants (really crunchy good) and paid a little more for my second choice of veggie, which was deliciously cooked kale.   There are so many kinds of hummus and toppings to choose from. I like the red pepper hummus and tabbouleh on top of my bowl of rice, veggies, and falafel. I also got tahini sauce on top of everything. I think the bowl is full of favor and creamy mix of goodness to enjoy.  Since I checked in through yelp while waiting in the line, I was able to redeem a deal/coupon for a free drink. The unsweet iced tea is delicious and refreshing. I can taste the real tea.",

    "text": "Welcome to Mediterranean Chipotle!  Okay, that's perhaps a little oversimplified and I'm guessing its a frequent comparison that drives owner Eddie Hantas nuts.  Nevertheless, the fast casual flow of the counter and the numerous possible ingredient combinations will no doubt feel eerily familiar to Chipotle goers.  Opened in 2012, Hummus Xpress is out to give the people what they want.  Tasty food at a good price, served at warp speed.  The buzz was enough to send me over to their Tempe location at warp speed on a Saturday for lunch.  Look for Hummus Express amongst a throng of small businesses in a strip center on the northwest corner of Broadway and Hardy in Tempe.  Inside, a small restaurant that seats maybe 25-30 people awaits.  I'd heard the crowds here for lunch can be epic so I arrived just after 11am.  Good move (only 3 in front of me).  As mentioned earlier, the ordering system is Chipotle-esque.  Step on up and follow the flow chart above from right to left.  Start with a format.  Choose from a pita, bowl, salad or plate (I opted for a bowl, which comes with rice).  Then choose from 4 meats (I went with gyros).  Then pick a vegetable (I went broccoli).  Then pick a hummus (I went jalapeno cilantro).  Then pick a salad (I chose tabouli).  And lastly, dress your meal with one of over a dozen add ons (I added chickpeas and salsa).  You also get your choice of a piece of white or wheat pita bread (white for me They do honor the Yelp check in for a free tea, but I opted for a water instead.  Lastly, I grabbed a piece of baklava (because of course).  Total cost for everything plus tax? $12.  The verdict?  Delicious.  And why not?  I basically made it myself.  In all seriousness though, Chef Hantas puts out a great product with great ingredients.  Great meats, great veggies, and great pita bread (from Baiz Market, no less).  Couple that with a simple ordering process and I can well imagine the throngs that come here to get their lunch fix during the workweek.  In addition to their brick and mortar operation, Hummus Xpress also operates a food truck and offers catering options.  Lightning quick customizable Mediterranean.  Chipotle should be so lucky to offer a product this good.",

I give it 5 stars for food, 4 for employees but they ARE NOT OPEN when their schedule says they are open. I've gone out of my way several times to pick up food for the house and they aren't open. Went again this week and they still had their closed sign 20 minutes after they're supposed to be open. At least update your social media, store sign, and website if you've changed your hours. I'd be willing to stop by if I'm in the area because of the eggplant, but I don't think I'll be going out of my way or be trying to bring friends anymore when they've been closed the last 3 out of 5 times I've gone.",

    "text": "Audio express, your home-home-home...  Just kidding. Looking for a new place to try and i chose this one from my never ending list. I walked in and sat at a table waiting for my friend and observed my surroundings. They've got a cool planter in the front with various plants which was unique. I looked through their menu and picked out what I thought would be a good combination.  When we got to the counter to order, I chose the white pita and got classic garlic hummus, flavored hummus can be overrated. They had falafel as a protein and I ordered that, which was a solid decision because they made them fresh. After that, I got roasted garlic red potato as my hot filling, lentil kale salad, and toppings: tomatoes, cucumbers, kalamata olives, green onions, pickled beets, and garlic aioli (can you tell I like garlic?) I was warned the olives were pitted and yet I still forgot and almost chomped down on one. Also I wouldn't get the beets next time, the sweet flavor threw me off. Otherwise, the mix of ingredients was tasty. I did have trouble eating the pita as the contents kept falling out, but it was fairly filling. I also got iced tea for checking in, score.  Honestly the concept of this place was strange to me, I wasn't sure if I'd like mixing all these ingredients together but it worked for the most part. Now I just need to fine tune which combos work best together.",

    "text": "Whoever left a review and said it was like a Greek Chipotle (there were many of you) really hit the nail on the head. It's pretty much exactly like Chipotle in terms of ordering and portion sizes. (BUT they were significantly more stingy than Chipotle when you ask for more toppings.)  It's not made apparant, but you can ask for unlimited toppings at the end. It's the step after the meat and \"special\" veggie section, and before the sauces area. If you're confused, I'm convinced they do it on purpose.. because they don't label the \"unlimited\" area like the others, and there's no sign that says toppings are included. But somehow, everything else is labeled perfectly lol.  Anyways, each bowl comes with a pita, which is awesome. Also, my food tasted amazing, especially the eggplants. The eggplants were REALLY good, I highly recommend them.  It's important to note that it's a little more expensive than Chipotle. It costs about $18 for two bowls, without tip. Not really happy about that price.  Can't say I didn't love my food though. I really, really enjoyed my gyro bowl!",

I love the option to customize my Mediterranean food exactly how I want so I'm a fan indeed. This was my first time visit and I was so torn between ordering the bowl vs. the plate.  The lady behind the counter told me the plate is huge but carry and heats up well so I'll have plenty of leftovers. The plate comes with 2 meats and all the fixings your heart desires. The bowl comes with 2 meat + all the fixings. I went with the plate for my first visit.  I ordered the braised beef and grilled chicken plate with rice. I topped it with the following items:   Ginger carrots, grilled eggplant, chickpeas, lemon flavored kale, sauteed onions, beets, white bean salad, cucumbers, tomatoes, roasted red pepper hummus, and tzatziki sauce. Upon first bite, I'm like Whoa! This is delicious. Upon third or fourth bite I realized I had too many flavors and textures together and it was a little strange. The braised beef was warm, the rice was warm but everything else was cold, including the chicken. The chickpeas taste like they came out of the can and into some sort of sauce. That was kinda weird but overall I enjoy it.   On my next visit I'll leave out the tomatoes and cucumbers as they do not carry over well for leftovers and I'll probably leave off the hummus. That too taste too store bought.   Lastly, all of the bowls and plates comes with pita bread. You can get white or wheat pita bread. It was hard as a brick. It comes rolled up in foil. It was so hard and cold that when I hit it against the table it sounded as if it was an object, not a piece of bread. It's free but skip it. You won't miss a thing!",

It is minute quick rice. And not everything yellow is saffron! Jesus! I wasn't looking for authentic but come on, they could do better than that! Their tea is good tho, I'll give them that. And service was friendly and welcoming. Suggestion to the owner: they need more seats, I felt rushed eating there because of the limited seating and people waiting for a table. Id suggest outdoor seating.",

    "text": "I would not have known about this place but for friends posting pictures of amazing looking hummus bowls on instagram. This place is tucked into a strip mall that, for whatever reason, I have never had occasion to visit despite living 1/4 mile from it for the majority of my adult life. Although strip mall is generally depressing (it's next to an MMJ doctor and a dry cleaner) the atmosphere is clean and modern if a bit stark.   A reviewer below mentioned that this is sort of a middle eastern Chipotle, which is a useful comparison. You basically chose a bowl, a pita, or a platter. Each option entitles you to a certain number of meats (or vegetables) and an unlimited number of toppings. The proprietor is more than friendly and guides you through the process, perhaps a bit too thoroughly, but it's great to see an engaged small business owner who cares about his product.   The food is outstanding. I'm a vegetarian and my girlfriend is vegan and there were plenty of options. Every filling was extremely flavorful in a non-cloying way. Sometimes the prospect of eating vegetables and hummus leaves something to be desired, but dishes like the roasted eggplant, cous cous, and the various hummuses (hummusi?) were so interesting and complex that I was excited to go back and try the dishes I missed.   I would have given the place 4 stars if not for one quibble - VEGAN TAX. Allow me to explain. Some establishments, this one included, do not deduct a dollar (or two) for omitting meat from the meal. There is no way that hummus costs as much as lamb, so in theory, a vegetarian bowl should reflect the difference in price. Instead of reducing the price accordingly, places that charge the same essentially profit from the difference between the cost of a meat dish and that of a vegan dish. In my opinion, this shouldn't be passed off on vegans/vegetarians, and essentially operates as a tax on vegans. If the guy lowered the price of a veggie pita/bowl/platter, I would go here more often.  Vegan tax aside, the food is great and fresh and the staff is nice. I'll definitely go here again and would recommend it to friends.",

My fiance's Vegan sister was in town and we needed to get something quick and tasty after a long day. I took orders and left for my one block journey. When I arrived the two gentleman working greeted me with smiles and took some time to get to know me. Everything looked AMAZING! I told them I needed something vegan and Eddie took it upon himself to create a masterpiece of Mediterranean Vegan friendly meals. They let me sample anything I wanted and I ended up with a wonderful gyro bowl with caramelized egg plant, roasted potatoes, and so many other yummy things. I would give this place 5 stars for their customer service alone, but they have amazing food as well.",

    "text": "I really enjoy the fresh taste and the atmosphere ! The restaurant is always clean warm and inviting and not  crowded either  .The idea of the way you order is like Chipotle .  You start with a pita of your choice white or wheat then have the employees pile what ever sounds good to you .The cooked veggies I am not a fan of but everything else is fresh light and delicious ! The employees are always friendly and will let your try samples before giving you a generous spoon full .The different hummus choices sound odd but once you try them you'll be hooked !! I like getting alot of food for a good price and this place is great for the amount you get .  My only complaint is my husband and I  tried the baklava once it was really rich and flaky like it was supposed to be but a bit over priced for such a tiny piece.One day I will have to try the falafals . My only wish is that my current apartment was closer ;) so I could eat it more often .All in all if your looking for something fresh different and something your gluten free , vegetarian or carnivore people in your life will like this is a great hole in the wall !",

    "text": "We happened on this place by accident the other day. We were waiting for our car to be done at the mechanic so we wandered down Broadway, saw this place and decided to grab some food... Best accident ever!   We were greeted by a very friendly staff, who explained how it all worked. Basically, they're a self-proclaimed Mediterranean Chipotle, but SO MUCH BETTER!   You have a choice of a pita, a bowl or a plate. We chose a plate, and opted to share it, and it was more than enough food! You get saffron rice, and then choose your veggie (we went with grilled zucchini and kale), and your protein (chicken, falafel, gyro, beef), we chose gyro. Then you move down and pick your hummus, they usually have 3 or 4 different flavours (we went with cilantro jalapeno), and salad (we got tabouleh). But wait! You're not done yet! Then you pick your \"accessories\": diced onions, pickles, olives, lettuce, tomatoes, etc etc. All designed to compliment your meal. We went with diced onions, pickles and kalamata olives.   Oh my goodness. This was seriously the best $11 I've ever spent at a restaurant. The gyros was tender and flavourful, the saffron rice was a great touch. The veggies weren't soggy. The cilantro jalapeno hummus had an amazing kick to it, and we thought it was better than most of the hummus you find at Trader Joes, AJ's, etc. The tabouleh was so bright and refreshing. The portion in the plate was perfect for the two of us to share. They didn't really skimp on anything.   I was thoroughly impressed with the whole thing. The guys were super nice, the food was amazing and the price was more than right.   The only downside which caused me to take away a star, was that there didn't seem to be a restroom. We thought it was a little odd, but then, we also didn't ask if there was restroom. But since there's usually a sign indicating where the potty is, and the only door led back to kitchen, it seemed safe to assume there was no where to go... if you needed to... you know... go.   Other than that, I highly recommend Hummus Xpress!",

I am always impressed by the quality of vegetables and meats, their gyro is some of my favorite, the grilled chicken a close second. Their hummus is a huge bonus, made in house, they typically have 6 different types that rotate. I can't decide which is my favorite they are all unique and delicious. Lemon ginger is fantastic,  you won't find it anywhere else, and the cilantro jalapeno is great if you like spice. I recommend any of their 3 or 4 different kale salads as well as their spicy ginger carrots. The 'pita' sized plate is more than enough food for one, and is just around $6 or $7. You won't regret going here.",

    "text": "I frequent this restaurant for multiple reasons.  1.) Good value. If you want a bowl, you have two options: Bowl or Plate. They're basically the same, except for the Plate is bigger and gives choice of 2 meats and 2 grilled vegetables instead of 1 meat and 1 vegetables. The Bowl is plenty of food for a meal. The Plate is almost impossible to finish in a sitting... I always have leftovers so keep this in mind when ordering.  2.) Delicious! Everything mixes together really well. My ultimate picks are: rice, double-eggplant, chicken and gyro, classic hummus, white bean salad, cucumber, beets, olives, and cheese, and double red chili garlic sauce (2nd sauce costs extra, which I usually don't pay for, but I said this was my ultimate), and white pita.  The flavor is really good, and unique. I don't know anywhere else I could buy something comparable, and I have tried other hummus-bowl type restaurants. Nothing is as good as this one.  3.) Very healthy. If you read point 2, you'll see that you get all whole ingredients with a good mix of vegetables, meat, and rice.   I'd recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a quick, healthy meal. It's similar to Chipotle, except a better value, healthier, and a completely different flavor/cuisine.",

Very pleasantly surprised to find a nice little shop with friendly helpful staff that warmly greeted me as I walked in the door! They were very kind to offer taste samples and at the ready to help as soon as I was ready.  My friend had also not been there before so it was a nice treat to try someplace new and different for him too.  Everything we tried was very tasty and freshly made! The allspice hummus was delicious and I particularly liked my eggplant and roasted potatoes with chicken in a pita!  I look forward to returning!",

I went in and if I were just giving stars for the staff and customer service I would give it 5 hands down. They were not only super helpful, but very friendly and enjoyable.   The food... It looked good, and they way they described it was enticing, but my boyfriend and I did not like it. It is just like a Chipotle for Greek food, and very quick. Although, maybe since we eat at places that cook our food to order, we are just spoiled. Most of our food was cold, the chicken and potatoes and like I said I live less than 5 minutes away, so it wasn't he time between the restaurant and home. We did warm it in the microwave, but I ended up eating the tasty (and only hot item) wheat pita and tossing the rest.   So, as I said earlier I am hoping this was an off night, and from my experience I wouldn't recommend, but maybe we will try again another night.",

When they ask if you want rice, YOU GIVE AN EMPHATIC 'YES' - the saffron rice is amazing.  At the end of the counter you have a generous portion of fresh, flavorful food. I love that they have multiple varieties of hummus every day (to be expected given the name), and each that I've tried so far is delicious. It's a good thing the flavors meld, because there isn't enough room in the bowl for it all without selections overlapping or stacking (i.e. hummus over your rice). This could be a minus to some folks.  A heads up - the parking is lousy (it is in a strip mall) and there aren't many seats inside. The soda is reasonably priced and has free refills, but only comes in one size, 12 ounce, which bugs my wife. Skip it for takeout and swing by Circle K.",

So I checked out the menu online before I came so I can get an idea of the options. I was super amped!! I adore hummus, pita and veggies,  so I felt like I was winning !! Wrong, the vegetarian bowl was this weird combination of cold, soggy and hot stuff piled on top of each other. I believe they are trying to emulate Chipotle ' s Aesthetic, sorry, not feeling it. What did it in for me is that the kale was cooked with the stems on. What a lazy move! I will not be coming here again.  Sorry",

I would have missed out, big time.  It was suggested I try a bowl since it was my first visit. Layered with Saffron rice on the bottom, the guys were really generous in letting me sample a variety of items rather than limit me to what is typically included. Both lamb and chicken were good, but to me there was no contest - the lamb was melt-in-your-mouth good. Curried carrots had so much flavor, as did the kale. Grilled eggplant and tomato had fantastic char-flavor and texture. They make all their own hummus, and it was truly inspired. I went with the beet hummus since it was deliciously rich. Tahini sauce and red chile sauce made for the perfect accent.  My meal was $7.95 and included a pita. I'm a big eater but even I had leftovers.   The format reminded me of Chipotle but the food was much more authentic and delicious. One of the guys is from Lebanon. They were genuinely grateful for my visit and I assure you, it won't be my last.",

I found this place because they've catered a few lunches at my office and always were delicious, so I finally went there on my own today and it was quite good.  If you like garlic, hummus, really delicious gyro meat, lots of tasty and uniquely prepared veggies and sauces served up in an authentic, fast friendly yet not chainy at all way, I would say it's worth a try.  I drove from Warner and Hardy all the way up there for lunch and it will be the first of many trips.",

I had a \"bowl\" and filled it with rice pilaf, gyro meat, ginger glazed carrots, jalapeno cilantro hummus, lentil kale salad and chose the whole wheat pita.  There are lot's of combinations to choose from and I will what to give them all a try.  Don't be put off by the neighborhood, it's industrial and little dated.  The food is great, the service is great, and it's easy find and to get to.  Recommended!",

Couldn't ask for more, except maybe for the falafel to be a bit tastier.  I get the chicken plate with rice, broccoli, potatoes, hummus, olives, feta and lentil and kale salad. A meal like that will cost you a little bit more than ten bucks, but is well worth it.  Pretty hip atmosphere with chipotle-style food serving.  They've got a few talented local musicians who play jazz guitar every once in awhile.",

Food:  I was a bit overwhelmed by the options so there was no method to my madness.  It really was delicious and the portions were huge.  I went with the Gyro, some kale veggie, the basil hummus, rice, etc, etc.... too much to list.  I went with the bowl while my gf went with the salad.    This place blew us away in all aspects.  Definitely plan on going back.  Only mini critique is to stay open later for us dinner procrastinators!",

I've always gotten a hummus bowl, but recently got the pita instead and you get more than enough food that it's an even better value. For the hot veggies, I absolutely recommend either fried eggplant or their grilled zucchini (my new favorite), and the tabbouleh salad is quite good as well. Their gyro is a bit fattier than I'd prefer, but I still can't get enough of it. You can get as many toppings as you'd like too!  This place is an absolute gem and a must for either lunch or dinner",

With how generous their portions are, that's impressive.  There's been some complaints in these reviews about the staff being impatient. My experience is that the staff absolutely expects you to know what you want, because you're an adult, but I didn't encounter any sass or frustration from the staff. Furthermore, two of my party were real, real old. Despite being confused and difficult to deal with, the staff treated them very well and were very patient.

Then all the options begins...   Chicken, braised beef, falafel, veggies, or gyro leads to a selection of 7 hot veggies ranging from lemon kale to fried eggplant. Then you made choice on 6 different hummus flavors (cilantro jalapeno actually has a bit of a kick!) Then salad choices (tabouli, kale onion, lentil kale) to finally finish off with an impressive array of toppings. Everything is full of flavor and cooked well, and the staff was efficient and nice.

This little place is pretty much like Chipotle with Mediterranean food.  I didn't really know what would taste good together so I honestly just followed the recommendations of who was making my bowl. I think I ended up with rice, chicken, cilantro jalapeno hummus, garlic herb potatoes, tabbouleh, and some toppings. My date has gotten a bowl with some fried eggplant which was delicious .. I regretted not getting that!  This place seems a little bit expensive for lunch - mostly because I normally don't want that much food anyway but it's still much less than other options.

    "text": "Good selection of fresh ingredients make for a good Medeterranian meal!  First, I like that this place isn't a chain. Many have compared it with Chipotle, because you build your email in a similar way. I would also say it's very much like Pita Bistro for the same reason. I think Pita Bistro has a greater variety, though.  Food: My meal was very tasty. I built a bowl with gyro meat, glazed sweet & spicy carrots, classic hummus, and topped with feta cheese, mixed pickled veggies, and garlic aioli. Everything was fresh tasting. The gyro meat was good, but nothing exceptional, and the garlic aioli was quite strong, but good!  Cost: With tax, my bowl was $8.71 - which is similar to other hummus & pita style places.  Also, I wanted to go low-carb, so I didn't want the rice that normally comes in the bowl. I was disappointed that they would not let me substitute another veggie to replace the rice.  Service:  When I arrived there was no queue, and the staff were friendly. I told them it was my first time there, and I was clearly undecided about what to get. But the staff didn't offer any suggestions, and didn't offer any samples to help me decide. I finally asked to sample one of the hummus, which they did, but they didn't offer any other samples. Last but not least, when I ordered my toppings I mentioned the garlic aioli, but was told tersely that wasn't a topping, it was a sauce. Really? Why the attitude?  Atmosphere: This is a typical strip-mall shop, but smaller.  Overall: I can see I'm in the minority with my 3-star review. They have an ok selection of ingredients and ok prices, but service wasn't up to par. I enjoyed my meal, so I might give it another try if I'm in the area.",

Fresh and delicious doesn't quite do it justice.  The flavors were sensational, the ingredients many and varied, the choices, Pita, Bowl, Plate or Salad, gave us many options, each made to order, all focused on homemade middle-eastern favorites, such as tabbouleh, tzatziki, eggplant, pickled vegetables, spicy chicken, simmered beef, gyro, kalamata olives, chickpeas, and of course, fresh, homemade hummus in four flavors.  Every one was delicious.  We awarded HX five stars despite occasional, brief objectionable background music.  We will definitely return.",

Always a great selection of hummus as well! For about the same price as Chipotle, you get way more choices and they don't skimp on your fillings.

There seems to have been a lot of employee turnover as I never see the same people working there anymore, and the prices were increased for no apparent reason (food quality didn't go up, etc). This last trip I also think I was overcharged even above the new prices just because I ordered extra veggies (supposedly only a $.65 upcharge) but the bowl itself is only $9 and I was charged $11. The line was already crazy long and we were getting held up by the people in front of us who were charged incorrectly and had to get their money back, so I didn't want to hold the line up any further by protesting the charge. I don't think I will be returning at this point because the food/prices just don't seem to be worth it as of recent experiences.",

We went in not having any idea how the ordering process was going to work. The menu is a little confusing, because it's different, but the guy at the counter could tell we were newbs so jumped right in to help us out. Basically, you can choose from a couple different plates that are $5 or less, or start with a larger plate or bowl and add stuff to it from there. You end with sauces, and if you are vegan they label which you can eat.  I got the Hummus with Falafel. You get to choose up to two kinds of hummus and add all the topping you want (there are loads of interesting toppings to choose from). The falafel was AMAZING. Not dry and pasty at all. Hot and crispy on the outside and oh so light and fluffy on the inside. Some of the best I've had. The hummus was smooth and flavorful. I ended up with an amazing amount of food for less than $5!   My boyfriend got the gyro meat with herbed sweet potatoes with all kinds of other awesomeness. When it came time to eat, he said he couldn't get it into his face fast enough. So good!  He had a fountain drink and I made an Arnold Palmer with their unsweetened flavored iced tea per the guy at the counter's recommendation  (I think it was a peach lavender tea or something like that - it was very good and they also had a black tea and mint one too).  We'll be returning for sure. The people were incredibly nice and the food was affordable, of great quality and had great flavor. Quite the little gem in a city that feels like it is busting at the seams with Mediterranean cuisine.",

Everything here is made in house every day with the freshest ingredients and the majority of it is vegan safe, they also offer a range of specialty drinks and pastry cupcakes as well to add variety to their menu.  The food is ALWAYS consistent and amazing.  When every I bring someone here to try it, they don't just say: \"this is good\", they say: \"WOW.. This is AMAZING!\".  They do an amazing job at personalizing your experience every time you go in, a place where everyone knows your name and they treat you like family, always greeting you and always telling to \"have a wonderful day\", always telling you \"thank you for coming in today\" and letting you know that your business is appreciated.  Hummus Xpress is hands down with out a doubt not only the best place I have ever eaten, but my favorite place to eat.  I'm very thankful they are around and I hope after reading this review you will come in for the same experience I have had again and again.",

They took their time to explain the menu to me, which I liked. There are so many different combinations you can throw together. Lots of meat for those that like that and plenty of fillers such as roasted veggies, salads, toppings and fantastic hummus. I got a bowl with a pita on the side. I would do a plate next time for dinner. The bowl is perfect for lunch. You get your choice of wheat or white pita. The staff is so respectful and helpful. I will definitely make this one of my regular weekly places to eat. Very excited to have found this place!",

    "text": "Hummus Xpress is legit! One of the best fast-casual restaurants in the Valley. Metro Phoenix is lousy with Mediterranean restaurants, and that's a good thing. I had a conversation with the owner about this, and we both agreed that Pita Jungle played a big part in spreading the growing acceptance and consumer love for this delicious cuisine.   The Mediterranean restaurants in town are all pretty damn good for the most part. I would be hard-pressed to pick a favorite. This one is right up there at the top of the list. In fact, I may just go ahead and make a list.   The way you order here is similar to eating at Chipotle or Q-doba, but instead of tortillas you're getting a pita and different fixings... except cheese. Pretty much everything you could pile onto a plate here is healthy, and it's all fresh. This would definitely make this a great place to try as your first foray into this type of food if you're a virgin.  The kitchen is immaculate and you can see it all from the dining room. The service is friendly and quick. And of course, the food is fresh and absolutely delicious. Since you get to pick what you want to eat, if you don't like it - it's pretty much your fault. I had a pita with beef and fixings, while my girlfriend had a chicken plate (which also comes with a pita, but you get extra protein). We both ate ourselves stuffed.   This strip used to be kinda dead - this spot used to be an always-empty Chinese place where the owner didn't give a shit anymore, but the new owner cleared out all remnants of what it used to be and transformed it into something great. The neighbor at Detroit Coney Grill did the same thing, and now this strip is bustling.   Hummus Xpress delivers (like actually delivers food to your door), so there's really no excuse to not try it. It was easy to give 5 stars here... I love this place. I will most definitely be back.",

Hey, it's Mediterranean... it also starts with M.  THE PLACE: Very very simple. Not very big and not a lot of seats, but number of seating is just right for the space.  It was clean, although I didn't really checkout the rest room. Decor was very spartan.  THE FOOD: Think Chipotle style, where you get to choose between bowl, plate or a pita. You get a bang for your buck by getting a plate.  The food was tasty. We tried the Gyro and Aleppo Beef.  Had different 'Fill Its' like Rice Pilaf or Saffron Rice, Lemon Garlic Braised Kale, Fried Eggplant,  Char Grilled Tomatoes,  Tabouli Salad, Turkish Salad, Garbanzo Salad, Lentil kale salad, Glazed sweet and spicy carrots, Caramelized onions kale salad and more.  Hefty servings for the price.  THE SERVICE: Staff is very friendly and helpful. Willingly explains all your options, and lets you taste items before you pick out what you want on your plate.  Been here a few times now, and every time always felt welcome.",

Canned soda and waters were all that you could purchase. I don't drink soda and sometimes water just doesn't hit the spot like a nice tea or other non-carbonated beverage would. I hope that once the business picks up this could be updated to provide other options.  It's a small place, but great menu/decor/atmosphere design inside (something I appreciate a lot).

I would have understood if the place was packed and we took longer than a minute to check out the menu. But nope! No one was behind us and we had just arrived.   We told him we were ready and aparently this bothered him since he asked us 3 questions in this order. 1. Is this your first time here? We said yes. 2. Do you have any questions?  Not yet, but we're ready to order. And #3 you should have questions,  this is your last chance.  We looked at each other thinking is this guy on drugs?? Cause he was hyped and angry....well who knows...we ordered the gyros. Don't care for the food. It was bland and they force you to add sides you didn't want. Who puts rice on a gyro???  I've had great Mediterranean and that was not it. Although bland the food was cooked right and there were some healthy choices. I would consider this place probably a modernized or westernized Chipotle style Mediterranean restaurant. So if you want classic, look else where.",

I always get the bowl with kale-onion salad, lemon pepper broccoli, garlic herb potatoes, chicken and the cilantro jalepeno hummus. I recommend this place to anyone who likes a fast & healthy meal or to anyone who likes Greek food! Staff is so nice and always seems like they're having fun, makes for a great atmosphere!",

The staff is very kind and patient to people who have no idea what they want, or have never been there before-- even during lunch rush! So glad I checked this place out!!!",
