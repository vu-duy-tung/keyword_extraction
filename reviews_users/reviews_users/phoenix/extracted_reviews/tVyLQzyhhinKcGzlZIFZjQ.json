It has a bit of spiciness to it, and the brussel sprouts have a hint of rosemary.  I usually order take out because there is often a wait when I finally decide that I'm ready for dinner.  Good service and the garlic bread that comes with the pasta is excellent!",

Tonight we shared the thin crust mushroom and sausage pizza and The Bistro pizza. Both were good though I prefer their Numero One-O.  As always the favorite part of our meal is the chocolate chip skillet cookie!  It is so decadent with the gooey chocolate and melting ice cream. Every time we order this item it doesn't last on our table more than a few minutes and is devoured   This always keeps us coming back and helps me overlook the next paragraph.   We sat outside tonight and I wish their fans were not so high velocity. Also, depending on where you sit, the water from the misters runs across the beams and drips on you.  Server didn't bring any silver wear until I asked and side plates had sauce still on them which we had to ask for clean ones.",

The Chicago thin crust pizza is some of the best tasting pizza I have experienced in the Chandler area.  The big drawback is the parking situation.

My husband was really craving Alfredo, and it was really early for dinner so we figured we wouldn't have an issue with having a wait for once, so we went.  We were seated right away and then promptly greeted by our server Kayla. She had plenty of input for us since it was our first time we have been there.  My husband did the build your own pasta and got chicken alfredo. I got the chicken parm sandwich and both were delicious.  Kayla was attentive and also told us about the free refills on my husbands pasta.  Since it was our first time there, Kayla gave us a free cookie too!! She really made our visit! The food was good, but since we already had a bad \"taste\" in our mouth (because of always having to go somewhere else because of a 45+ minute wait) if we had just had mediocre service, we probably wouldn't have came back.  The only word of advice I would say would be to allow call ahead seating.",

First, they dropped the count on a wing order from like 14 to 10. More importantly, the quality of the wings went from plump, full-size wings that were outstanding, to scrawny ones that all but disappear when dropped in the fryer.   I'm not sure which accounting pinhead comes in and makes these decisions, but if you\"'re listening, I would happily pay a dollar or two more to keep getting the same great order of wings  Stop cutting costs with subpar food.   The pizza and garlic bread are always solid. We are likely to find a new place for wings after the change, since it's no longer worth the drive.",

It did seem a little disorganized, people going this way, people going that way, I can't count that against them though.

There is a warning on the menu saying that there is a 40-60 minute wait for the pizza because it's hand made...really, an hour!? I love pizza and Uncle Bears, which is a 15 foot walk has equally as good of pizza when you consider that it's ready in 10 minutes. That said everyone was very nice.",

The food isn't bad, don't get me wrong. We ordered a thin-crust pizza (can't remember which, but it had some kind of white sauce) and it was okay, but definitely not the best. The deep-dish pizza takes so long to cook and we didn't think we'd make it till then, so we skirted away from that part of the menu. I don't know, maybe those pizzas are better. I'm willing to give this place another chance but for the price and hubbub, the food was just okay, the wait was long, and the noise level was ridiculous for a lunch hour. Even our waitress was a little annoying, I hate to say. She insisted on chatting with us before she took our order, and we were hungry! Only plus: the cookie/ice-cream dessert we had was hot and delicious. I'll go again if I ever get the urge to give it a second chance (or if I just want another pazookie), but as for entrees, I love Italian food, and I've had much better for around the same price.",

I've also tried a few other times which haven't disappointed!  If you're going for lunch, they also have a pizza slice special. Don't be fooled, the slice you receive is really big & filling! The bowl o pasta is also a really good deal! All the items I've had have been very large in portion, ample serving to share.  Just a note that if you're planning to pick up an order, give yourself plenty of time. You might have to wait up to 30 minute for a salad on a busy night but it's worth it!",

Tip; never order the other crust or you will be waiting an hour to eat. Not good if you have a toddler.  Salads are great. Pizza is so delicious even if it's just a cheese. They use Wisconsin cheese only if I'm not mistaken. Anyway, great food and great service. We will continue to come back.",

Appetizers come out 2 minutes before pizza, disappearing wait staff, filthy beer glasses. Pretty much any way to provide poor service is perfected here.   Just a couple years ago we all talked about the amazing service at Oregano's. You would walk in and be greeted 10 times on the way to your table, followed by amazing wait staff. It's a very different place now.  Countless options out there - We won't be back.",

So now to the food wasn't very good at all my grandson woke up at midnight throwing up what he ate so did Mom and Dad , will never go back to this location!!  Should of went to the Gilbert location it's soo much better and the workers are nicer and the food is 100% better. So I wanted to Thank the Chandler location for making my daughter's birthday the most unpleasant one ever!!",

This is not on the Postmates driver, I only point the delivery out as it arrived in a timely fashion where the food should still be hot and fresh. Instead, the food was cold and pretty flavorless. I'm disappointed because Oregano's is one of my favorite restaurants and I typically order the same thing, the Big Rig Pasta. This order of Big Rig Pasta wasn't entirely flavorless but close to it and it was cold. It had minimal sauce and there were three different pasta types thrown into it. Sometimes you'll get an accidental noodle in your pasta which is no big deal bit this order had several. I also placed an order for a side of fries and they were so soggy that it was almost as if they had sat in a bowl of water. I took one bite of one fry and it was like eating a raw potato so I threw them out.   I know dining in is usually the way to go at Oregano's and I'm not saying I'll never go back, but this was a disheartening experience as I've never had the quality of food be this poor at any Oregano's.",

I personally don't care for lasagna, but tried it after my husband started moaning over it. The best lasagna I've ever tried... I'll be getting this next time.   The Antipasto Thing - 5 Stars. Delicious. The Jr size is more than enough for two people to share.   Old-Fashioned Sangria - 4 Stars. Very tasty...   The Service - 5 Stars. Excellent... Jordan was a fabulous server. See more below on service.   The Bad:  Mardi Gras Chicken Melt - 1 Star. Nowhere in the description of this sandwich does it say that the chicken will be cold (not cool, COLD). When everything is steaming hot, the texture of cold chicken is unappealing and borderline inedible. I ate less than 1/4 of this sandwich before giving up. Plus, the description states it is \"cajun\" chicken. The chicken literally tasted like it had come out of a can - no flavoring.  Jordan (awesome server) asked if I wanted it boxed and I said no, thanks. I wasn't going to say anything, but she pressed and I gave in. She spoke with her manager and offered to bring me something else for dinner. I told her it was ok, I didn't need anything else. She insisted so I ended up taking a Veggie Wedgie home.   I would have given this visit four stars, but Jordan going above and beyond bumped the experience up to five stars.   We'll be back!",

I've been to restaurants that struggle to duplicate the success. No so, the managers at Oregano's have their act together, including a full practice night of orders, acting customers, and creating great food before they open to the public.  Long live Oreganos. The thin crust Lawrence pizza is great, add sausage is you want some meat. The spinach broccoli pan pizza is amazing. The Pablo Picasso salad is a wonderful blend of a little spicy salsa and thin tortilla chips with chicken. You must try this salad. The place is good for kids, family, a night out, or the out of towners that come in. It's a must visit in Arizona. I've been lucky with the wait on Germann.

If you get a salad you have to try the Pablo Picasso, but all of them are delicious. We usually get the Alfredo the Dark with chicken when we order pasta, but you can't go wrong with any of their pastas. I'm not a big fan of thin crust pizza, but theirs is tasty. We used to love the Pizza Cookie for dessert, but they haven't been as good since they switched to aluminum pans instead of the traditional cast iron. The cookie just doesn't bake the same in the aluminum.",

Always enough food to split to save room for a Pazookie aka pizza cookie;) However, this time it was a little over cooked and they skimped on the cookie dough. Probably why it was over done. Still yummy though!",

I have yet to even eat inside and I've been there a few times. The wait has never been longer than 15 minutes for my family of four and the service has always been very nice. I know many of the workers (students at Hamilton High) and they have been trained well. The pizza does take a bit to get to you, but it's well worth it. I can usually finish my portion of the pizza, but sometimes I come home with a few slices and it tastes just as amazing the next day!  Definitely the right place for pizza night!",

    "text": "The take out counter is a total joke. Every single time I order here, they DOUBLE their quoted wait time. Today, I'm told 20 minutes. 45 minutes later, over 30 minutes waiting in their lobby, I'm told TEN more minutes. The manager, after seeing that I was annoyed, offered the pizza for free. While I appreciate the free meal, I'd really prefer that this location get their crap together. I don't have time to wait this long with a 3 year old girl with me, just because you can't make a pizza in over 60 minutes. Ridiculous. I'll drive to a location that isn't as close, but they can get an order out promptly. Avoid this location unless you want to WAIT and WAIT.",

Zucchini sticks were mush and because they are put in a plastic container and put in a heat tank the breading is soggy. Very unappealing and inedible. The wings also soggy for the same reason. Flavor is good but for $12.79 for 10, I'll make my own. All in all $40 for a small brick pan pizza, soggy mush zucchini sticks and soggy wings. Grossly overpriced!!!!!I've had the thin crust which isn't too bad, but for the life of me I can't understand why they cut the pizza into little squares?! You wind up with tiny pieces of crust that are not even a slice the pieces in the middle now have no crust at all.....it just feels wrong. No more Oregano's for this household. Service was pleasant.",

    "text": "Like all Oregano's restaurants (I think I've been to all of the ones in AZ), I think the food is A-OK.  I have my favorites (pasta and golden wings) and my least favorite (all of their pizzas are pretty bad...wannabe fancy but quite can't make it).  I don't particularly like sitting inside because it is loud.  And I appreciate the clean-cut, very friendly staff.  So I gave the 4th stars because: 1) My husband looooooves Oregano's portions.  Yes, \"typical American\" portions.  You could feed a whole third-world village with one of their plates.  So the 4th star goes for my husband who doesn't Yelp.  Yes, I know, how can I be with him? 2) PATIO.  Living in a state with the most awesome Fall/Winter weather in the world, I often wonder why more restaurants don't have appealing patios.  I come from the land of \"terrazas\", which means that all bars and restaurants put tables and chairs practically on the street to attract patrons.  And they are always full.  I love sitting outside, and with some well-placed misters you can extend the life of a patio for a couple more months.  Yet in Chandler I don't find many, sadly.  Patio sitting is also the perfect solution for those of us that have children, I don't know, it makes dining with them more relaxing.  And Oregano's patios rock.  This particular location has a huge one with a giant fireplace and firepits.",

The bartender that was on took him 10 minutes to come and even greet us and take our drink orders. We asked another girl if she could but her excuse was I can't go behind the bar all we wanted was water and teas I'm pretty sure water and tea isn't only behind a bar. Then it took our bartender another 10 mins to come check on us to see if we wanted to oder any food. I could tell he had his regulars and the entire time he just talked to them and basically stayed away from our end of the bar that we were sitting at. Once our drinks were empty we had to ask a different waiter to grab refills and he said ok but didn't even grab our drinks so we wait another 5 or 6 mins for refills. Then when the bartender came back with the refills his comment was \"sorry I promise I'm mot ignoring you\" if that was the case then why did the 3 of us feel like we were being ignored? My dad is usually a great tipper but when it comes to bad service he won't leave as good of a tip. I was extremely annoyed by how unprofessional our bartender was and how he felt no urgency to check on us at all. This was the worst experience ever and it's sad because we go to this exact restuarant all the time but because of how we were treated we have no intentions on returning any time soon.",

We were told that it would take an hour for our pizza to be prepared.  We came to the restaurant after an hour ..and we had to wait another 45 mins!!!  No pizza is that good!  If you have 3 hours to go get pizza ... and nothing else to do, I'd recommend this place.  If you have a life ..and value your time, I'd say no.  Every once in a while I still go here, but .... only if it is 11:00am ...and I have time for a 2.5 hour lunch.  Not a place you can go to on a regular basis ...and still juggle a busy schedule",

I think a lot of people felt like pizza that night because it was sooo crowded even on a weekday! We were brave enough to sit outside on the patio in the murderous Phoenix heat, so we didn't have to wait. Agreeing on a shared pizza for four people is difficult, so we just had cheese, tomato, and basil. It was very basic, but very good, and the large fed all of us comfortably. My friend is always on a diet, so we had the thin crust instead of the deep dish which was perfect for our type of pizza. We also shared a small dinner salad which was plenty for all of us too. The service was great and they were very attentive in refilling our water which was good because it felt like we were eating in the Sahara. We also shared their version of a BJ's Pizookie and that was delicious of course! My friend and I had a frozen Bellini which was perfectly cold and yummy but weak in the alcohol content. My boyfriend said his margarita was really weak as well. Kind of expensive, but this ain't Domino's. I would come again.",

It is not East Coast pizza which was a bit of a bummer but they do have thin crust Chicago pizza which is pretty similar and, if you're a deep dish fan, you're in luck. The portions here are HUGE! Everything is supersized. It's impressive. The drinks are as tall as my forearm; no refills needed! We ordered the chicken wings - good size and the regular buffalo is a good choice. I highly recommend the brussel sprout appetizer. They were yummy! I thought the decor was fantastic. It was old time-y complete with I Love Lucy re-runs running.   You can eat in or eat out. Good for kids and groups. The bar is pretty tiny, though.",

Aris called me, on his day off, to verify that were still coming and to let us know that he wouldn't be there, but had already talked to the people at the host station, about the arrangements, and we would be taken care of.  Certainly, above and beyond what he needed to do.  Our wait staff was very attentive and were great when we needed to have food come out earlier for the kids.

We usually go to the downtown Gilbert location but since we are wild and crazy (obviously, we eat dinner at 3pm, you can't get much cooler than that) we figured we'd switch it up today.   The service was excellent. Our waitress was busy but extremely attentive. Another waitress stopped by just to admire our kids.   Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the food as much as usual. I had the zany ziti and the noodles were so undercooked they were chewy. The bruschetta appetizer was good but I like the guaca-Tony the best- highly recommend! The server gave my daughter an obscene amount of Parmesan cheese so that's a plus in her book!   Oh and the ice cream pizza cookie...to die for. Seriously, if you go to oreganos and don't get it then you're missing out! If you sign up for their emails you get a free ice cream pizza cookie! Is it your birthday month? Free ice cream pizza cookie!",

It was so greasy you could squeeze it and grease poured out of it. I tried to get our servers attention more than once to alert her of our issues, but she never came around.

    "text": "So the last time I was here there were a few things that didn't go well. This time, almost everything was great. C had just finished with his play and wanted pizza. He and K bantered back and forth, C wanted Oreganos, K wanted Rosati's. C wins. We were already heading home so instead of turning around and going to the Gilbert location, we headed for the dreaded Germann Rd. location. I say dreaded because I knew, I knew the parking would SUCK. And, it did. heck, it was a Saturday night and Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers was kickin it. The parking lot was packed but I drove around the back of the buildings and found a spot. Not the safest place you want to be on a dark night, but oh well. We got sat right away. No doubt. It was almost 10 and there was no one waiting. Probably couldn't find parking. Scott was our server. He came up almost as soon as we were sat and took our drink order. We also tossed in an order of Cheese Bread with Marinara ($5.88). This stuff is soooo goood. Oooey Gooey melted cheese on an entire Baguette which ends up toasted just right. And with my favorite marinara, it's just the best cheese bread around. As I always do, I ordered the Big Dinner Salad ($3.99) w/ dressing on the side. The lettuce is fresh although I do wish the prep cooks would tear it or cut it into smaller pieces. sometimes you can end up with a huge strip of Romaine which is just unruly. We also ordered an 18\" Thin with sausage and caramelized onions ($19.87). The crust was almost perfect as were the toppings. A great job on a thin crust.  Now comes why not 5 stars. Styrofoam to-go boxes. We had a good portion of pizza left and Scott brought out a Styrofoam box. Would someone at Oregano's please put a stop to this practice. Pizza belongs in a box. The layers of thin crust end up sticking together and really, you might as well just throw the whole thing away because it can be very difficult to re heat the leftovers. BUT, being an Oregano's regular, I have learned to keep the paper from the cheese bread and use it to separate the layers of leftover pizza. Shouldn't be my job though. Crappy parking (again), yummy cheese bread, awesome marinara, very good thin crust pizza, fair prices, decent service. 4 Stars.",

Upon receiving said gigantic salads, I looked around and noticed everything is huge - drink cups, salads, & pizzas. All is fair though, I was ridiculously hungry and though the Picasso Mexico Salad would suffice. Did. It. Ever - and some! Although I asked for dressing on the side, I was happy it was mixed in due to the salad's size.   Our server was funny, maybe a little too goofy. But good all in all.

At first, you would think it would be fun for kids since they get to play with some pizza dough, but the time you wait for food and the quality of the kids options are terrible.  On our last visit, it took 40+ minutes for kids cheese slices ($2.99/each) and an adult pasta dish.  It sounds cheap but it turns out the slices are stale old pieces that are reheated.  Having to wait 40 minutes with younger children is not fun.   Honestly, it would be a much better option to order a full 12\"+ for the kids, at least it won't be stale.  My dish was luke warm, tasted ok, but most of the chicken were bad cuts and hard to eat.  Then the pizza cookie (told it would take 10 minutes) actually took 25.  My kids actually told me that they never want to come back, which they have never said about any restaurant before.  Our server was polite, kept our drinks full, but obviously knows how to play dumb with the slow kitchen.  I was going to give my feedback to a manager before we left but there was nobody around, so yelp it is.",

    "text": "My husband and I tried this restaurant for the first time this past Sunday afternoon. We're new to the area and up until this point had not found a good pizza place. The food here was delicious. We ordered the garlic cheese bread and cheese pan pizza, both were amazing. The garlic bread was a meal in itself and arrived pretty quickly. The pan pizza exceeded my expectations. I especially enjoyed the crust which was buttery and flakey, something I had never experienced before. The cheese was gooey and fresh, and the sauce was well seasoned.   Our server was polite and attentive. He let us know that the pizza would take up to 40 minutes. We decided to stick it out and just relax and enjoy the experience. The appetizer came out quickly, and the pizza did not take 40 minutes, more like 25 or so. I loved the food and highly recommend this restaurant.",

At first I thought maybe it was because I was pregnant everything tasted soggy and gross but before I even said anything my husband stated it. The only thing that was good were the wings but because of the service it took forever to get our food! Including the cookie at the end. That alone took 25 minutes. Not impressed with this location. It has certainly turned us off from going to Oregano's for a long time at least. This oreganos needs some serious love from corporate.",

Before we ordered, we asked to move to an outside table and all the servers were so helpful in moving us. It was a Sunday night so it was very busy at Oregano's at this time but didn't wait longer at all. About 30 minutes after we ordered our food, a manager came up and told us it's taking a little longer than expected so they're comping us desserts. We didn't mind waiting at all because we recognized we ordered a deep dish pizza and a lot of other food, so it was so nice that they were comping us desserts without being asked or anything. Our server Ashlyn was such a sweetheart and despite how busy it was, she so attentive to our table, and the other managers that gave us updates on our food were so kind too. It's customer service like this that is so appreciated and makes people want to come back!",

Young lady answering the phone took my order efficiently, pleasantly, and read it back to me to confirm.  (Basics, I know, but trust me when I say a lot of places have strayed from these basics). She gave me an estimated time of readiness (25 mins, solid time for me), and off I went.    Got to store at 23 mins later, young lady (different one by her voice, I think?) also pleasant.  Rang me out, offered me a drink while I waited (say what?) and told me it would be another 5 mins. It wasn't. It was 2 mins, just like originally stated.  When it came out, she went old-school on me and opened the lid to confirm my order. (See comment above on basics).    Pizza was hot, fresh, and as this was my first time with the Parm Pizza, really tasty! Different than my usual pepperoni, but still flavorful and a nice change.  Kids portion was generous!  Nice takeout container, even came with a little breadstick! Best part? Service with efficiency and courtesy. I haven't frequented this Oreganos a lot yet, but I will now!",

If you are not a patient person order your pie like a hour ahead but honestly if you dont it is always worth the wait. There pan pizza is the best in all of AZ. I have tried so many pizza places here and yet to have something better. I would gladly challenge anyone on it. There other food is delicious as well the wings of fire are workout a doubt one of my favorite wings always crunchy and not to greasy.   Finally the pizookie $4.99 for a incredibly satisfying dessert for atleast two. Way worth it, money aside unless you are some freak who likes a hard cookie with ice cream you will love this. So many flavors and you can get half and half.   Overall the pizza is heaven but i have come here even just for the dessert or wings.",

So finally manager brought the food said sorry and again reminded us of the 39 min. At this time I am pretty done and want to get out oh did I say we sat by a screaming child.   Told manager to just bring me a box and take my card we would like to leave.  She offered to pay for our meal I said no sorry giving me a free meal what will fix this place I paid and left.

The environment is somewhat noisy when this place gets busy but it is also somewhat cozy. Italian items line the walls and the theme is well done.  The customer service was great, at lunch time and during busy dinner hours. The wait time for food wasn't too bad, maybe 20 minutes, but when the food comes out, it's all worth it.  The food is just so good. Not much else to say about it. I tried the thin crust meat pizza and it was very good. The second time I went I tried the Baked Pasta in a bread bowl. I could only eat half because there was so much food.  Great place to eat. Call ahead and check the wait times though, they get busy at night.",

    "text": "Oh wow!  Homey and warm atmosphere friendly to families and with a sense of humor too!  Our server Sean was friendly and warm too, and spent a lot of time getting to know us.  The place was packed at dinner time and we were offered to wait or sit at a high top table for two at the bar.  So glad we did!  It was very comfortable and we felt like we were in our own little booth even though it was not enclosed!  We chose the Big Beefstro and the Oregano's Favorite salads.  The Big Beefstro salad that I ordered was huge and so tasty with strips of rib eye, jalapenos, Romaine, little onions, secret white cheese, cilantro, spinach and topped with crispy onions.  Served with a sweet Serrano pepper lo-fat dressing that made your mouth water!  The Oregano's favorite salad that my wife ordered was also full of flavor with all of her favorites:  Romaine, sun-dried tomatoes, kalamata olives, spiced feta cheese, roasted red peppers and raisins in a honey vinaigrette dressing and topped with red onions.  She added chicken and washed hers down with Blue Moon and I chose a local San Tan beer.  The T-shirts on the staff had hilarious captions on the back:  \"Legalize Marinara\" and \"Nice haboobs\" (have you looked that word up yet?)!  We will be back to this amazing place, an Arizona institution and well-run.  The signs on the walls and especially in the spotless restrooms were so interesting to read that my wife was about to send in a St. Bernard with a keg to rescue me because I had been gone so long!",

    "text": "Oregano's is within walking distance to our house and so it's a weekly staple for us.  Surprisingly, we don't go for the pizza!  We go for the salads.  Yep, you can eat healthy here (although I must admit...the garlic cheese bread and pastas surrounding you will make it difficult and call your name, tempting you to order them or reach over and steal a bite of someone's food!).  I think we have actually only sat at a table one time.  We always scoot on up to the bar to eat.  No wait, friendly bartenders and fast service right there next to soooo many good beers on tap.  The Oregano's favorite is MY favorite salad.  I always get it with chicken.  Hubby likes the classic chicken ceasar salad.  Both are always made fresh and not sure what they do to the chicken, but it melts in your mouth and is soooo delicious.    Occasionally we will \"splurge\" and eat something outside the salad \"zone\".  If/when you do that, go for the garlic cheese bread with marinara sauce.  I could eat 10 of those in one sitting (even though it would be \"carbocide\" - hahahaaha!!).  The pizza is pretty good but I find it very salty.  The wings (on the appetizer menu) are also delicious and I love that all of them are drumsticks, so you never get ripped off with the little wings that other places seem to give you more of.  All drummies here!    Everyone here is friendly and it's a must go when in Chandler.  Keep up the good work, Oregano's.",

Ordered a stuffed pizza (which, let's clarify... there is no such thing as a stuffed. Pizza. It's just a pie at that point) and I asked for 3 basic things. Sausage, pepper, & onion. I gave them like 20 min before I showed up to pick it up and it still wasn't ready AND my order was wrong. Sausage, pepperoni & onion is what I got. How?! How?!! Then I sat and waited some more for it!  I get home and not only is this not cut (maybe it's not customary to do so, so w.e.) but it's practically 70% cheese (if you have children PLS supervise BC as an adult I almost choked). A thin slice of sausage at the bottom and raw chopped onion throughout. It fell apart once I cut it and was a total mess to eat. For $28 this was NOT worth it. And don't get me started on their disgusting thin crust pizza. Can you say extra salt?! Save yourself a trip and get a decent slice of NYPD pizza.",

They gave us a cute little table for two, outside right by a fire.  The food, OH MY GOD, was so amazing. We ordered the Oregano's big salad, thin crust number one-o pizza, and a chocolate chip cookie pizza. We throughly enjoyed EVERY bite of our meal. I had the house made italian dressing with my salad. It was a very big salad and was plenty to share.The pizza was very unique and the crust was so delicate. Not your typical pizza from someplace like Pizza Hut. The cookie pizza was TO DIE FOR!!!! I haven't stopped thinking about it since out visit.   The service was a little slow but it was dinner time on a Friday evening so I can't complain. We enjoyed the fire and romantic atmosphere which made the wait for our food not seem too bad.   Visit your local Oregano's! It will be your new favorite!",

The Minestrumbo soup was good but a little spicy for me. And I love spicy! Hubby had the toasted ravioli and didn't care for them, said they were like cheese sticks.

Not much personality, and really didn't take the time to give us suggestions or explain the menu when we said that was our first time there.  Not so much as a smile, or a \"How you folks doing?\", etc.  Just kinda dragged the atmosphere down.  I did find it cute that they had a small pizza tray and a hunk of dough there for my 15-month old son to play with.  It's safe for him to eat too, we made sure there weren't raw eggs in it.  We ordered the Dinner Salad, cheesy bread, and the Uncle Ray's 12\" pan pizza.  Plenty of food for 4 people(probably could have done without the cheesy bread).  Salad was good.  Cheesy bread was okay, a little too cheesy for my taste, but  not bad.  The pizza was much better than I expected.  Crust was good, and the toppings were excellent with good overall flavor.  Definitely will go back for the pizza and salad.  They also have carry-out service, which may be a good alternative.  FYI, call ahead if you know you're ordering a pan pizza, unless you don't mind waiting 35 minutes for the pizza to cook.",

Will definitely be back to see try other things on the menu.",

    "text": "Let me preface this review by saying that I absolutely HATE chain restaurants and I avoid them like the plague...The only reason why I started coming here was because they opened a new location within walking distance of my house and sometimes it's just convenient. With that being said, location alone is not enough to earn them my four star review, nor is it enough to keep me coming in as often as I do.   The food will not blow you away, but it is still VERY good and it is VERY consistent. (And reasonably priced)The chefs may not be geniuses, but they are experts when it comes to cooking the food that Oregano's offers. I've never ordered something and had it come out not the way I expected. (With the exception of having my calamari come out way too greasy on TWO occasions, but when you order something 4-6 times a month for over a year, you have to expect some mistakes)  As mentioned above, I come in quiet often...so often, in fact,  that I'm on a first name basis with the bartenders and some of the wait staff. The restaurant is going to be (very) busy regardless of what night you go in. Expect a long wait and expect your server to be very busy...Where they may lack in time, for the most part, they make up for it in kindness. (sometimes their kindness borderlines \"cheesey\", but that's neither here nor there) I've learned to bypass this wait, by heading straight to the bar area. Even on the busiest nights I can usually find a pair of seats...  Like I Said, the food is very good...I get the fried calamari every single time I go in and in my opinion, it is some of the best I've ever had. Tender and crispy without being too heavy. (Ask for a side of the lime Parmesan wing sauce for dipping along with the marinara it comes with) My other favorite appetizer is the Holy Guacamole'...If you're a Guac fan, I promise you will not be disappointed.   I've had everything on this menu and there's nothing I don't like...The wings are drumsticks only, sauced perfectly. The pizzas, each variety, are great and all of the pasta dishes will leave you satisfied. (Not blown away, but definitely satisfied)   I will say that the lasagna was better before when they'd bake it fresh, but it was an hour investment and you can barely tell the difference...",

That is cool. I was bummed to see that they took the Ol Mexigano pizza of the menu. That was our favorite specialty pizza. We tried the BBQ chicken pizza as an alternative and it was very good. I would like to see an option with spicy BBQ sauce as the sauce used is very sweet. Still good, but I will be missing the Ol Mexigano pizza.",

All i wanted a small portion of pizza (which is on the kids menu for only a slice) but instead i have to order a whole 12 inch pizza because of him. Usually, I love coming here & it is a wonderful experience, but not today. I will be going to the Gilbert location from now on considering this unwelcoming environment. Highly recommend if you come here you do not bring your child that is 9 years old because they will have to eat a whole damn pizza because the server has a strict 8 year old rule. Also recommend not getting the server that looks like a younger George Lopez / Taylor Laughtner mix and approximately 6'2 server. (also says penne wrong) Disappointing!",

I got a personal pizza and I was stuffed afterwards. Getting that with a small salad and a cold soda , was great on a spring Arizona day. It could easily be a 5 but it is missing just a couple things . A little too corporate that's all . What I mean by a little corporate I mean a little too obvious , no real surprise. You get what you are expecting and getting what you expect. It is easily one of the best Chicago style pizza in the Phoenix area. Service great , parking great and food overall was very good.

We ordered the thin crust meat something pizza and it was excellent, but we were too full from the calamari, salad and beer.  We ordered a small salad and pizza and they were both medium at best.  Now to the service, the hostess was very nice and receptive to our needs.  The bartender was awesome as well.  The one that took the cake was our server, Sierra, she took great care of us for any need that we had and did a great job of keeping the flow of our dinner going.  Whether if we needed drinks, apps or the next course of food Sierra was always there.  She also took the time and chatted with us about all of our food decisions, which really helped out.",

The food quality was good and we enjoyed it a bunch. Service was good, considering how busy it was.

For non-pizza lovers - their bollo pasta is endless, but one bowl of angel hair pasta and homemade sauce is enough to fill up anyone who is hungry.   Recommendation: Their Alfredo the Dark is only \"okay\" if you get it as is. I would order extra sauce or it's too dry to be edible.  End with a pizza cookie. Just do it.",

I'm not one to try new menu items, I tend to play it safe, but I recently transitioned from the Bollo Pasta to the Rigatoni and OMG! To DIE FOR! Dylan is a great server!

Since pizza was their specialty we ordered a 10\" Chicago style deep dish pan pizza with sausage and portobella. Knowing it's a 30 minutes cook time we pace through the appetizer, salad & drinks but still had time to kill.  I browsed around and noticed other people only had thin crust pizza on tables.  I asked our waiter about this and he says no one wants to wait 30-45 min for pizza.  NO KIDDING!!!!  Then why not take customer's pan or stuff pizza orders when they are waiting for a table bc there's ALWAYS A WAIT?!?!?!  I know restaurants in Chicago do that.  Anyhow, by the time our pizza came out it was a big disappointment.  It didn't help when the waiter added dry, pre-shaved Parmesan cheese on top of it.  Pan pizza 2* - crust was soggy not flaky at all, sauce was nothing special.....not worth the wait!!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tVyLQzyhhinKcGzlZIFZjQ?select=71M8kVwvt_R3lV-Z7TYySg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/tVyL...</a>  Bistro Calamari  2* -  Big Beefstro Salad 4* - this was my favorite dish of the night.

We got some cheesy garlic bread that was just fine, lots and lots of gooey cheese, about what you'd expect would please a teenage boy.   Then came an enormous thin crust pizza, which was very nice indeed. I missed the name (I let him handle the ordering), but it had a slightly Mexican theme to it, with cilantro and some green sauce. I found it very appealing. And, needless to say (after that garlic bread), we didn't finish it, and you know what pizza's like the next morning -- yum.   Beer served in a nice tall glass (for me), and they have Dr Pepper (his favorite). A good pizza place with a bit of the exotic, I will no doubt visit again next time we're in Arizona.",

Just a note that if you want the stuffed or pan pizzas, they take 40-50 minutes. It was close to closing otherwise this would have been the way to go.   Ended up getting the cheesy bread as an app which comes with marinara as a starter.  It was so oooey and gooey and full of flavor. I loved the garlic under the cheese.  So good.   Then got the thin crust pizza with pepperoni and ham.   I loved that the crust was made with cornmeal dusted around the edges. This place sure knows how to do Italian right.  I loved how cheesy the pizza was and how the toppings were thick.   I really recommend coming here for some amazing pizza. It's expensive but well worth it.   I also liked how friendly our server Quincey was and the fortune cookies offered before exiting.",

I was jealous of his meal, it looked awesome.  I would recommend splitting plates here, because everything comes in massive portions.

Sauce is flavorful, serving size large, love the garlic bread, and they'll even make one to-go so lunch/ dinner the next day. And very reasonable price wise!  Would have given 5 stars but server missed request by both of us for our cookie desert and delayed our evening. Other than that we really enjoy Oreganos.  Take the family you'll enjoy!",

Do not disappoint yourself if you are not ordering deep dish and do not go at high peak times, you will be pleasantly satiated. A large salad can last for three to four lunch meals and is very decently priced for the amount of food that you receive. Flavor in food is wonderful. Gluten-free and vegetarian options are abundant.",

They were quite busy for a Sunday night but were sitting people quickly.    As I said initially, I ordered my food well in advance.  I'm a big fan of their Stuffed Pizza, it takes an hour to make, so I order it to go so I don't have to occupy a table for almost 2 hours for dinner.    My order consisted of Chicken-Not Wings(boneless wings), unfortunately they weren't anything to write home about.  We also ordered the Stuffed Pizza with Black Olives, Mushrooms, and Chicken.  It was worth writing home about.  Oh my gosh Y'all, so good!  Did I say how good it was, Wow!    This made it so worth it, it was better than I remembered!  If you get a chance, you need some Stuffed Pizza in your life.  You don't know what you've been missing! Just sayin'!!!!!",

Asked them to push 2 empty tables together at the 1 hour mark; they immediately started talking about me behind my back not realizing I was still standing there. A group of 9 that came in after us was given a table as we stood there and watched.   I spoke directly to the manager Rosie and she was extremely rude and told me I was welcome to leave if I didn't like it.  The way she spoke to me and my family, in front of my kids, was unacceptable.  Rosie told us the group of 9 had priority because of their group size, even if they arrived after us.  This was for my wife's birthday. Won't be returning to this oreganos or any other location.",

We ended up waiting 60 minutes and if we had known this, we would have just left. It was obvious we were irritated. Manager didn't seem to care.  We were finally sat an hour later. The guys ordered a pitcher of beer, he sets it down and it looks horrible. Looks like the sediment in the bottom of Apple cider. They take a swig, it was gross and flat and asked the waiter for a new pitcher. The manager then comes over and asks what's wrong with the beer??? We look at it and it's pretty apparent by just looking, but we tasted it and it was disgusting. He comes back 5 minutes later with a different attitude and tells us he's switching the taps. Because obviously we weren't complaining for the hell of it and know what that beer should taste like....   Food was alright. Just really disappointed that no one knew what they were doing. There was 5 people who have been servers at the table and our mind was just blown. Was surprised he didn't bring out some bread which would have been a nice gesture for the shit show and cost him near to nothing, but no. Won't be back.",

We walked in and was pleasantly greeted by the hostess immediately. Our server was Josh and he was so sweet, pleasant and efficient....now he knows how to provide great service!    We started off with a \"big\" simple salad. Made with romaine lettuce, tomato , pepperoncini and croutons. The \"big\" is enough for 2-4 people depending on the portions but the real big is really big! There was only two of us and we still had some left over.     I had a thin crust pizza with spinach and garlic while my friend had a thin crust pizza with sausage. My pizza was sooooo delicious!   This is the Oregano's I know!  Very good service with yummy pizza!!! Definitely recommend!   Oregano's has some good food options but the service today was terrible!!! Generally it is pretty busy here but today it was not so bad when we arrived, there was no wait. It started with the hostess who was annoyed we didn't want a high top chair and requested a booth. Despite there being empty booths, she made us wait for I have no idea what..other than she seemed annoyed that we requested a booth...really? Two elderly ladies came after us and made the same request  Others received their food way before we did even though we were there at least 30 minutes before they arrived. The same elderly ladies that came right after us were sitting next to us; they ordered a soup and salad yet they waited even longer for soup and salad! and they sat down a minute after we did. I don't normally care about this stuff nor do I pay very much attention but it was ridiculous...these poor elderly ladies looked at us and said \"we just ordered a soup and salad.\" Yet people that came after us ordered pasta, appetizers and a salad.  For some reason our waitress just avoided some tables around us and tended to those that came after us. The manager looked like he realized what was happening and pitched in to help out....thanks Mr. Manager. We ordered a thin crust pizza (with jalapeno, spinach and 1/2 sausage), wings and a \"Big\" House Salad they have the \"Big\" or the \"Real Big\" but the big was big enough for two). They got the pizza wrong (didn't put the jalapenos) but the pizza was still good. Overall the experience was not very good because we were here nearly two hours, for poor service and the wrong order. It's too bad because oregano's really offers some good food options....the service isn't worth going back.",

Often when a great little places branches out and goes in to the pseudo chain food business some flavor is lost, but not in this case.  For the launch party we had a special menu with limited options which meant i was forced to try something other than my usual favorites.   We started with the cheesey bread. Garlic bread covered in cheese, what is not to love with a side of marinara. If it were up to me this would get a bit of browning time under the salamander.  For my main I split a deep dish with mushrooms. It was pretty good very different than the usual thin crust I get. But be warned a deep dish takes 40 min plus to cook.  We also had a salad with fried onions on top, it had a sweet and spicy dressing that was very interesting, the hot fried onions on top did heat up the lettuce a bit so a chilled plate would be a good idea next time.  What does look great about this spot is over the original one is the ample parking and patio full of fire pits and places.  So go check it out I can assure you a few hundred others will be there, so be prepared to wait.",

After I got through the layer of sauce I was left with 2/3 of a bowl of inedible pasta. However, we also ordered the zany ziti dish and it came out perfect.

I won't go into details about the level of poisoning to save all who read this.   I called the store this morning and spoke to a rude little manager named Natalie. I didn't want my money back or anything at all. When I told her what was going on two things happened that made me furious.  1. \"well, no one else has reported being sick so maybe it's just a bug you caught.\" 2. \"What do you want me to do about it? It's not like I can really do anything.\" She even went so far as to say that ALL good born illness takes at least 24 hours to come up. Really?! Do you have a food handler's card?!?! It doesn't take that long in most cases. At minimum she should have to take that test again!   I used to work at the Scottsdale and Shea store. No manager who wanted to keep their job would ever be so snarky with a guest! And they would never try to blame said customer and blow them off.   I simply tried to let them know and she was basically a word I can't  say here!   I won't go back here. I was taught to take care of the guest. maybe she needs some lessons....

    "text": "So, I wrote a review about Oregano's before and having eaten there recently I thought I would write a newer review.  I haven't eaten here for over two years, because I had moved outside the state, but on a recent visit I had the chance to eat at one of my favorites.  I have to say that I was no longer impressed with the food. I noticed that the menus changed a bit and some of the same foods were altered. I had Zany Ziti with a side of Meatballs. Immediately, I noticed that the meatballs had no sauce added to them and the ziti wasn't as cheesy/saucy as before. This definitely alerted the taste of the dish. My wife ordered a standard cheese pizza and noticed that the taste want as good as we remembered.  Could be a change of palate but I know really good food and now that I've eaten here recently it was no longer a great place.  Is it True that with growth of the franchise that the quality diminishes?",

Plenty to share.   Then there is the pizza. So many different combos of flavors.  I have tried them all and cannot complain about any of them. They are like music to my ears and happiness to my stomach. They give kids their own doh to play with. The tropical tea is abundant  Bring a sweater...they like to keep it about 60 degrees in here.   If you live at the Vive...stay away. The businesses here don't need your cars flooding the lots here too. I bet the Vivers are the ones requesting all the giant boulders to block the parking for anyone not driving a Prius.",

The pasta was delicious, I got the baked ziti with meat sauce.  My only complaint is there should have been more meat in a meat sauce, it would have been better off to get extra meatballs on the side. AJ offered us a complimentary pizza cookie to go for our first time in and it was very tasty!! All in all,  a very pleasant experience, nice dinner, great atmosphere...the only drawback was the overzealous jazz music in the background.  Jazz seems to be their theme but it wasn't very fitting, it would have been better to have some Rat Pack goin on!",

From the pizza extremely salty, garlic bread was saturated with butter to the point you take a bite and butter dripped.  Yuck.... Kale salad, also too salty.  I don't understand what has happened, someone in the kitchen has a heavy hand in seasoning your food.  Like I said I'm from California, sitting my grandsons, wanting to have a special Saturday dinner working on a puzzle and just having fun.  That was short lived.",

Oregano's has pizza better than oh-my-god-I'm-in-love pizza. The sheer amount of amazing that they put into their pizza blows me away. Granted this style of pizza is not for everyone, if you don't like New York or Chicago style pizza (thin crust or deep pan with a tiny bit of spice to both) turn away now. For those who like this kind of pizza, this is the best (that I've encountered) of its kind. The taste of their pizza entirely makes up for any wait that might occur (depending on how busy they are). Their skillet cookies are better then any other I've ever had. As soon as it hits the table my entire family digs in and it's gone in a flash, we all love it (try not to burn your tongue on the heat of the freshly baked cookie). Did I  mention it has ice cream on top of it? My only real complaints with the place is the overwhelming loudness of the music and the long wait for both seating and food. Otherwise this is one of the best restaurants I've been to",

There was enough food that I didn't need to order a child's dinner for my son (In fact, we had enough leftover for lunch tomorrow).  We were immediately seated.  We chose to sit on the patio (there was plenty of room inside) which was fun but too many flies to make it totally enjoyable.  Next time we will sit inside.  My only negative would be that they put the bread sticks under the pasta of the Chicken Alfredo and that makes them too soggy ( I would serve on top or the side)  and it was a little pricy for casual dinning. Thanks for a great dinner!",

The only reason that I am giving a one star is the service was terrible.  We have been coming to different locations of Oregano's for years and years and have never had bad service.  But this time things got kinda confused with the waitress I guess........apparently there was a mixup in regards to who was taking care of our table.  There was a managers meeting in the back and our waitress decided to take our table, but then had other employees bring us refills on drinks and our food.  Our waitress forgot about us, we were done for about 10 minutes and decided not to order the pizzookie (which is our favorite) because it would have taken another 15 minutes.  Such a bummer tonight, we will come back again just disappointed in the service.",

Attentive, detail oriented, described the food items perfectly with any questions we had, simply just awesome! We had a perfect experience at Oregano's. The entire staff was attentive and helpful (something you don't see every day). Now the food....the food was ridiculous! For starters we had a house salad which was awesome, we ordered a deep dish and a thin crust pizza, flavors were perfect and plentiful so looking forward to our leftovers.

I realized after this that they didn't even ask you what our preference is (like most restaurants do), so now we're out in the cold & their response is \"we have heaters outside\" . NOT the same as inside. Cold chairs and a cold breeze make for a chilly & definitely not relaxing dinner. F this location. I will NEVER come back.",

Family and I decided to eat here after my niece's first recital, were seated right away & our server introduced himself & got our orders going. Everything was going well.. until our server brought out our cups of water and accidentally knocked them over & wet us.. and I'm not talking just one cup.. must've been a couple or more. My dad got his entire pants wet and so did my boyfriend, water somehow got inside my purse and wet all the contents in it, the floor underneath our table had puddles of water. It was very much a mess and the look of horror on this poor boy's face as he apologized over and over again while running back and forth to grab napkins. Family & I were more shocked at what actually just happened more than we were upset. But we understood, accidents happen. Not only did our server offer to pay out of pocket for appetizers or pay half our bill(we declined by the way, did not want him spending his own money), he told on himself to his manager who then came over to our table & also apologized. In the end, they compensated one free appetizer & charged us half the price of our entire bill which came out to be less than $20. They really did not have to do all that, but for them to, it shows a great deal of how much they value their customers and their name. Although it wasn't the 'perfect' dining experience, we were pleased with the service we received.",

I ordered the jumbo chicken parm which it wasn't.  Small piece of chicken with pasta and not enough sauce. Hubs ordered the sausage and peppers and he got juicy sausage and plenty of sauce.

Many of the locations but particularly the one on Dobson and Germann in Chandler. Many friends have recommended it but we seen to get stuck in ruts and go to the same places. Well lucky for us, this time we decided to give it a try. Wow! Well now we know that for sure that we will be back. Starting with service, we arrived just as Sean was coming in shift and he sat us in his section. That was a very fortunate break for us. He was very personable, professional and most importantly helpful. He guided us through the menu and provided a couple of suggestions for salad and entree. As he explained the servings are huge so we ordered one to share and also a salad to share. His suggestions were spot in for us.  The flavors are interesting with the mix of fresh Italian ingredients and some really nice Mexican spices like chipotle and poblanos. The spice is just enough for a nice little kick and not overpowering at all. Best of all we were able to enjoy the leftovers the next day and they were still awesome. The only down side is the entire area has parking limitations as there are a few restaurants nearby.  So for us the final grades are service A++ for Sean, food A+ for freshness, flavor and serving size, atmosphere A.",

There was a line outside that looked like forever. But, we walked right to the bar and sat down.   New menu! New Options.   I order oldies: Stuffed Mushrooms and Pesto Pizza. The parental unit orders the new Kale salad (I don't do meat products, so I pass. Smelled/looked good though).  Everything was on point! Best of all...my two Top Shelf Cadillac Margaritas! Hand squeezed with homemade Sweet & Sour! Who does that? Not many, that's for sure. 1st one was made with lemon instead of lime. Tasty, real tasty! 2nd....had it made regular (with lime) but with a lemon wedge. Man! Those drinks were on POINT!   Hands down to the manager over there! His menu suggestions were righteous and his rita's were the best I'd had in weeks!  Good food. Excellent service. And hearty portions. A little pricey...$85 dollars later, and worth every penny. But, hey! That's the price you pay for good food AND good service! Right?  I'll definitely be back!",

Once seated, we ordered a slice of pizza each. Also ordered some chicken parm to go for a family member at home. Told the waitress to bring the pizza but take their time cooking the chicken since it was to go. A half an hour later, no pizza was produced. There were many empty booths in our section and only one table was being served salad, and then some entree they ordered. I guess our order was not \"priority\". Why advertise that if you want a quick lunch, to order from that section of the menu, if you are going to not rush the thin crust cardboard pizza crust with bare minimum sauce and cheese? It was the worst excuse for a slice of pizza I ever had. Epic fail Oreganos!",

Of course the wait for a table was 30 minutes-ish. The hostesses luckily had square sampling of thin crust pizza to calm the hunger. While waiting we went over to the bar area where I sipped on a moscato.  Cold crisp sweet adult grape juice! One seat at the bar was so close to the dusty register that it was a good thing that we didn't eat food there. Kind of awkward to be dining with wires from the register in front of your face and no room to eat.   Table finally arrived and with so many choices we picked the Oreganos favorite salad, Parmesan line wings and Alfredo the dark. The waitress asked if we wanted one of the plates to come first and I suggested that the salad come first. ....... Nope. Didn't happen. All the plates came out at the same time - as not suggested and waiting so long for the salad that should not have taken 15 minutes-ish.   The salad is always great because it's reasonably packed with kalamata olives, romaine lettuce, feta cheese, roasted red peppers, red onion rings, pine nuts and honey vinegarette. The pine nuts tasted stale and old. Luckily those dropped to the bottom of the plate. Wings were great. The pasta dish was supposed to be composed of the poblanos pasta diced Roma tomatoes and cream. For some reason I didn't get much of the poblano punch in it. This was more of a vanilla dish for me.   Leftovers were packed in front of the table - which is how every restaurant should pack. The night was overly stuffed like a thanksgiving turkey but enjoyed the many bites.",

Once it came out the salad my husband ordered called Kale Ceasar had barely any kale. They offered to remake it which took another 10 minutes. The second version looked like what he ordered. He waited so long my LO wanted more pizza. So by the time by husband finished his meal the additional slice showed up. The meal was horribly timed. Then when we had finished she asked if we wanted her to \"start\" a pizza cookie for us. For fear of how long that would take, we passed.  Our waiter seemed over extended with tables and other people were complaining about the wait.   Overall, bummed.",

They did their best to take care of us.  That's good...but...  The Guaca-Tony bread was very salty.  No idea why, but it was.  And I LIKE salt.  I'm a potato chip junkie.  But it just didn't work here.  The guacamole was mediocre, too.  Definitely \"meh\".  If it hadn't been free we might have sent it back.  The calamari was overcooked, too heavily breaded, and salty.  We actually sent that one back.  If you read my reviews you would know I almost never do that.  Maybe once a year.     Lastly we got the rigatoni.  It was spicy and pretty good.  We added meatballs.  They were OK.  Not fabulous, but OK.  Reasonably large, too (though not large like Buca).  The garlic bread that came with it was salty. What's with all the salt? I love salt, but this was too much.  I've never experienced this before.  And it wasn't just me.  My wife had the same reaction.  I'm surprised to see four stars on Oregano's.  Maybe if we had ordered the pizza instead?  But what we ordered was mostly disappointing.  I don't think we'll be back, even though we have another free Guaca-Tony coupon.  I do appreciate the server and the concern of the manager whom the server notified, but that's not enough to make up for mediocre food.",

They also use cheddar cheese on most pizzas.  The salads are good and we have had the Pablo Picasso a couple of times.  The dirty monkey drink I ordered was mostly ice so the next one I ordered I asked if I could have \"light ice\" and when she brought me this the glass was just over half full to \"compensate\" for the \"light ice\".  This was odd in my opinion. The first Dirty Monkey I had was so full of ice that it was all that hit my lip as I drank it.",

But the thin cheese pizza (which, in my opinion, is the best way to judge dough and sauce) had no flavor.  Really, you only tasted cheese.  Sauce had absolutely no flavor, and the dough was dough--brought nothing to the flavor of the pizza.  Now, I'll definitely say that a lot of people had stuff on their pizza--and perhaps that's how you're supposed order at this restaurant.  But a good pizza should stand on its own, and this one really didn't.  We had to add Oregano, parmesan, and salt just to give the pizza some flavor. We had the Calamari--they were strips rather than rings.  They were deep fried with a heavy batter, and the oil was likely old.  The batter came dark, the marinara was too thick, and the calamari itself tasted old.",

There were only 3 of us, but our drinks were mixed up, it took over 15 minutes for our server to even take our orders. She did not come and check on us, and all of our iced teas ran out as we were eating. When we finally got our checks, the wrong items were in the checks so we had to ask her to fix them. One of the members of our party had to ask 4 times for an iced tea to go. The server brought our check without asking if we wanted desert. We were going to order desert but opted not to, as we figured we wouldn't get it until 30 minutes later again, plus after she dropped off our checks we never saw her again. The only reason I gave 3 stars was because the food was great as it usually is no matter which location I've been to. I can say I will not return to this location based on the service I received.

We go on off-times to avoid a long wait and usually the service is awesome. I wouldn't even bother trying to go on a Friday or Saturday night, especially with impatient kids in tow.",

    "text": "We had dinner here and it was really a cute place.  Ordered a 'Chicago-style deep dish' pizza.  The crust was definitely NOT like the good Chicago pizzas that have cornmeal and oh-so-tender crusts (a la Lou Malnati's or Giordano's or Uno's). The guys from Oregano's need to make a field trip to Chi-Town to actually eat some of those awesome pizzas.  But, the Oregano's pizza was certainly tasty, and we had plenty to take home - it was actually better re-heated the next day. Service was pretty ok, but we were served by the bartender, who had to keep running back in forth from our table to the the mixology station.  It was tough to get his attention when we needed something, but he was very, very nice about it.",

    "text": "Clearly a very disappointing visit to Oregano's.    Always been a fan of this place, but the quality sure seems to be on the downward spiral.  The Beefstro Salad my ultimate favorite lacked dressing and not much beef i.e. totally lacked the zing.  The pasta was very average and the sausage was kept whole on the side, not mixed in and nothing special about the Chipolte Sauce.  In summary very average.  I could have gone to Trader Joe's got some of their fancy pasta sauce, pasta and sausage and replicated the same.  Sadly this place is now a hit and miss, as its not my second time that they have come up short.  While this chain is growing, keeping quality and service that made them a regular favorite is something that seems to be a challenge.",
