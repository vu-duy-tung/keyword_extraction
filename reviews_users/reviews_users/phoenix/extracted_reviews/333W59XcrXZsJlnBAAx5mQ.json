The chicken tamale my daughter ordered was huge too and very good. My other daughter ordered the taco plate with rice and beans, it looked fabulous. I did not taste it but she said it was great. We ordered the fried ice cream for desert and it was great too! The waitress was very pleasant and she made sure our drinks were always full, asked if we wanted additional salsa without us having to ask for it.  We will go back!!!!",

I asked if we could have some more, and when the check came I was charged $4 for a side of grilled onions (didn't even have any peppers) So I felt a little ripped off, but I still love the steak fajitas and I also love the rice and beans. I will be back and nextime not order any extras to be safe.",

La Pinata is unmatched in terms of price, portion, flavor, and overall quality. A $12 appetizer nachos supreme filled up both my girlfriend and I. If it wasn't so unbelievably flavorful we even would've had leftovers. The fried ice cream defied all expectations by coming with a chocolate tortilla. The flavor of the ice cream and toppings would've been fantastic by themselves. We will be returning on a weekly basis. Highly recommend.",

On our most recent visit I ordered the beef mini chimis. It would be great if there was an option to have them available 1/2 chicken and the other 1/2 beef. Nonetheless they were delicious and the cream cheese dip is out of this world! Their refried beans and rice are authentic and delicious. The prices are moderate and affordable.

LOVE the outside patio lighting. Atmosphere is extremely pleasant. Booth seat isn't too worn in and still bouncy!   Got the #1- Enchiladas were delicious and served on a hot plate, had enough for leftovers, and would order again.  Margarita was 95% tequila-AKA fantastic and forced me to take an uber home. One tequila, two tequila, three tequila, uber... Ya feel? ;)   One negative experience was the waitress. she was not very friendly and never asked if we wanted drinks or appetizers. Ran away to the back with our IDs when we ordered a drink. Had to request through other employees to make orders and get her to the table. Never introduced herself.  In short, I enjoyed the atmosphere and food, we will be back again! Thank you!  PS please make taco Tuesday deals all day versus during happy hour times.",

    "text": "My favorite chimichanga at a sit-down restaurant.  Many years ago I used to hit up La Pinata about once a week in its old location. It's one of the best casual Mexican restaurants I've ever been to. I recently got to sneak in before the lunch rush at their new location. It used to be Mary Coyle ice cream *sad face*.  The chimichanga is big. It's lightly crisped all around in deep fried goodness. The beef has an option of either machaca (really just shredded beef, no eggs in it) or ground beef. I prefer the machaca - tons of seasoned shredded meat that has never been dry or burned. Lots of red sauce but not quite drowned in it and a bit of cheese, lettuce, chopped tomato. The lunch special I had comes with rice, which was fluffy and good, and beans, which were very creamy topped with a bit of 2 different cheeses.  I've tried their tacos (good), tamales (average), enchiladas (good), \"There's a taco in my burro!\" burro (interesting but okay), albondigas soup (very good), chicken tortilla soup (okay, was always salty), Pinata Chimi (very good), machadilla (great), fajitas (average)...almost half their menu but at their old location. I'll have to come back with an update and try some of these again.  Their complementary chips are above average. The salsa is very chunky and tasty. The hot sauce is really good - hot in heat and lots of chili flavor.  The new interior is all windows towards the street with a front patio that can seat quite a few. Plenty of space between tables and booths. The bar is off to the side with about a dozen seats. They still have a couple of pinatas a the entrance but not nearly as many as before. It's nice. Parking could be an issue - they have about 20 spaces and when I left around noon, not a single spot was open.",

    "text": "So I was coming from Portland on a weekend trip and wanted some good Mexican food. Not nouveau, authentic, fancy, Mexican. Just honest to goodness tasty Mexican food. And a margarita or three. I did a lot of research and talked to many friends and finally settled on this place. Mostly it was the pictures of the beans and rice. I like my beans pinto and mashed. And I like rice that is not in the shape of an overturned bowl, meant to look fancy.    So we get there on a Friday night around 7 and I'm expecting a wait because the parking lot if filled. We enter through the back and immediately the fresh smell of peppers hits us and I know we've made the right choice. We were immediately seated at a nice table by the bar and it was our good fortune to have Gabby as our server. She was very sweet and had a can do attitude!  She recommended several dishes and we decided to start with the Mary Lou Christmas tree. It's basically a fat quesadilla served with beef and red sauce on one side and pork and green sauce on the other.  It was phenomenal and a ton of food!  Seriously we would have been full from that, but my wife and I love enchiladas so I ordered the red/cheese with beans and rice. She ordered the chicken ala carte.  Again, very, very good.  Great salsa and chips too.  We wound up taking at least half the food home and had for lunch the next day.    The margaritas were just ok, not fantastic but the service was A plus!  If you're looking for good, down home, tasty Mexican with great and friendly service with huge portions at a very reasonable cost. this is the place.  There, aren't you glad I did your research for you?",

A sweet older lady thats been coming here for years recommended the tamale and enchilada to me and I'm a glad I ordered it. Best Mexican food! We will be making the trip from chandler more frequently and the owner was especially sweet as well.",

The food was tasty and not terribly expensive (though pricier than some 'americanized' Mexican food restaurants). I had the fajita chicken burrito and he had the bean and cheese burrito. He raved about his burrito. Mine was fresh and flavorful.... maybe not rave worthy, but good. I will definitely be putting La Pinata into my Mexican food rotation.

The menu is just as good as the old menu; I might have noticed a few changes, but not a lot.  The food is still spot on, just in a more appealing environment.  Check them out, you won't be disappointed!  JM",

The plates come out piping hot, the refried beans are incredible, the cheese is real cheese, the lettuce and tomato garnish is so fresh... the salsa tastes like a grandma made it after years and years of experimenting with recipes... resulting in the most delicious salsa that is not too spicy but spicy enough.   The restaurant is also decorated beautifully. Not sure if it was custom designed, or was an effort by the owner - but it turned out gorgeous. No matter what time of day you go there, it feels like an intimate night time dinner in another place. Even the women's bathroom is designed beautifully (I love checking out restaurant bathroom design..)  Definitely a great date night spot as the food is delightful and the ambiance is spot on.

So we hadn't been back in 6 months till today.  Our server was the bartender and we sat in the corner table. 1st he got my husbands order wrong... whatever,  towards the end of the meal I wanted another beer, he never came over, in fact I watched as he talks to a guy sitting at the bar ignoring us and the table next to us, so I went up and ordered my beer, he was quick to bring it out at which time we asked for to go boxes and our check... 15 minutes go by and he's still talking to the same damn guy sitting at the bar... by now I'm pissed. So I start to stand up to go talk to the owner, he sees me, runs over with the boxes, and again I have to ask for the check... I left pissed off and angry ... in my adult life I have never left such a bad tip for service, but ignoring your customers doesn't earn u a big tip. Here's a hit, if u don't have time to wait tables DONT, leave it up to the servers... WE WONT GO BACK",

I remember Hope, the first lady aka founding mom of La Pinata. When I get to Heaven my hope is she will be willing to provide an endless supply of chips and salsa to me. I have known Roseanne, Romana and Peter since I was a little kid. I grew up with a kidney disease and eventually had a kidney transplant. I am an alumni in the Make A Wish Foundation in other words I was a Make A Wish kid. When Roseanne, Romana and Peter learned about Josh going on this Make A Wish trip to Canada they eventually threw a party closing down their restaurant to celebrate my life and raise money for Make A Wish. These people are some of the kindest people you will meet. I go there often and am always met with heart warming communication.",

I got the tamales lunch special. I'm usually not huge on tamales, they tend to be a little heavy, but WOW! The tamale was perfect! Light, but filling, a little sweet, and the perfect texture! I was in love! The server also got my Arnold  palmer just right, mostly tea and a little lemonade, fantastic! The tables were far enough from one another to feel private, but not too spacious. The taco that came with the tamale was really good, itself. The shell was homemade, which really made it perfect. The server was attentive, even though she seemed busy, and I must have seen 50 people either coming in or going out in the hour we were at our table. Parking is a little rough, but that's always been the case with that location, and as a Phoenix native I expected as much. Fantastic place, and I'll definitely be going back.",

Although they have seafood throughout the menu, we were informed they don't serve seafood because they have too small a kitchen to handle it. Ordered veggie quesadillas (which the server said were excellent) only to be told later they've removed it from the menu. They offer beef and chicken fajitas but can't hold it and call it veggie? Asked for fajita vegetables on the side which turned out to be a dish of sauteed onions. These guys are in one of the hottest areas for new restaurants in the city, so they better get it together if they're going to survive. By the way, the space is beautifully decorated. Perhaps they should've diverted more thought to the menu for non-meat eaters and (apparently) the kitchen size.",

I asked to see dessert  menu,which was ignored twice by server.So no flan today !  Bottom line:Food was marginally OK ,Service was bad and this surprisingly  from an iconic  restaurant with 45 years in this  business . Emphasis evidently  is on bar offerings \"Casa Margarita'  they call it.Try El Bravo  or Las Glorias or Los Compadres if you are after good Mexican fare in  North Central Phoenix.   FYI :I've lived in this neighborhood for 46 years so I believe  i know  my Mexican food.  I voiced my dissatisfaction to the Manager.No plans to return.",

The restaurant itself feels large, but cozy. Well decorated with an outside area.  The Bentley margarita is amazing! The chips came out warm and the salsa had the perfect amount of spice. The server was very sweet and frequently checked on us.  We came earlier in the night, but by 5:30 pm it was packed. I saw many large groups. Overall a great experience. I would recommend to anyone in the area!",

The tacos was piled high with delicious and fresh ingredients and were my favorite of everything we tried. It comes with a verde sauce that is to die for. My husband ordered the combo #4 which came with a red chili burro, crunchy taco, and tostada. We added a side of rice to try as well. He really liked his dish, especially the tostada. Our server Reese was very helpful, friendly, and quick. Based on the food, nice and clean atmosphere, and amazing customer service experience we will be back again soon!",

La Pinata really stands out. The decor is modern with a neutral pallete, but they still have traditional Mexican flare sprinkled in to add some culture. Like the three Dia Dos Los Muertos musicians pictured.  The bartender was incredibly friendly. She kept checking in on us, and was always at hand for refills. I also think it was a nice touch when she brought plastic ramekins for our to go food. The margaritas she served were great. They weren't too sweet. You could taste the tequila and skip the heartburn. She also made us beer backs since we like to create our own Beer-rita.  The food was awesome! Their salsa is chunky, and has just the right amount of kick to it. If you need more heat they also have the hot stuff on deck. The shredded chicken in my enchilada and taco was tender and juicy. The enchilada also had green chiles and salsa that made my mouth sing. I'm so over one ingredient enchiladas. The beans were rich and creamy, and the taco was packed with flavorful toppings. Loved every bite!",

    "text": "After having been regulars at the old location on 19th avenue for years (and having reviewed it a couple of times), we were excited to visit the restaurant's new home. We had great expectations, and we can honestly say that we were not disappointed whatsoever.  The new site, which was once the old Mary Coyle's ice cream parlor, has been transformed into this superb Mexican food restaurant.  Every aspect of the new place is simply head and shoulders above their old locale.The parking is more spacious and less scary, the bathrooms are modern and expansive, and the whole interior was well laid out and just evoked an upscale bistro look.  The food, which was the highlight of visiting the old location, was even better - if that was even possible. My wife commented that her chimichanga was really crispy on the bottom, and the meat was very well cooked and seasoned. And my #4 (Taco, Burro, and Tostada) was simply scrumptious. And the flan I had was simply superb. It tasted like it was even more freshly made than normal, just for us.  Even though I have rated them 4 stars in previous reviews, I had to give them 5 stars for the astounding service. Marleen, our server, was just amazingly efficient, friendly and courteous.   All the supporting wait staff, including the lady that saw my glass empty from all the way across the room and came over to provide me a refill, were just simply astounding in their attention to detail. I had never complained about their service before in the smaller locale, but they really did elevate their performance here at the new place.  Although we had to wait for about 25 minutes, even though we didn't have to really wait before at the old location, that did not detract whatsoever from our experience. However other regulars were complaining about having to wait. They obviously haven't been to eat in downtown Gilbert on Fridays and Saturdays and wait for an arduously long period for a table - anywhere there! That will certainly get you to appreciate the diminutive time spent waiting at this restaurant.  The location, the food, the environment and decor, and most especially the service deservedly receives 5 stars from us!   We are now truly unabashed fans of the sensational new location.",

And I don't like that he never brought my change. There was one other person there besides me. So it wasn't busy and I asked two times for my change. This is on a Monday shift change at 3 o'clock and that was the guy you came in at 3 o'clock. And he just went to long is the way ignored me and never gave me my change. I will never never ever come back here again I get over I told them I was waiting till 3 o'clock on a Monday to get the 3 PM to 6 PM happy hour chimichanga price for six dollars. I'm a woman by myself saying I'm new to the area and this is how you treat your guests? You're lucky you got two stars from me you should've gotten nothing you don't rip women off. I was on a limited amount of money before my next check I thought I do a little something on my only day off. And you have male bartenders that take advantage of women and their money and don't even bother coming back with their change. I watched him and I'm wondering when he's going to bring my change back and there's only one other customer there. I left about 3:45 PM it was very very slow so what the hell was this guy thinking I'm Giving him all my change? Do you know how many dollars that was? You guys are full of crap and your food was so average and the drinks were water down Go take a vantage of women they come in there by themselves",

    "text": "The food is just as awesome as it ever was but there is a problem with an old school waitress. She was no fun at the old place and it continues today. I'm kind of recognizable so she probably has it out for me. Tonight I signed my bill with a note, I wrote, \"Poor service equals poor tip, please apologize to the bussing staff\". I felt terrible stiffing the kids but I felt I needed to express how I perceived her service. The other servers were working like rock stars and showing attention to each and every table.  To be True to the guidelines I will not mention names but many long time visitors probably know who I am talking about. It wasn't the half bowl of chips she started with or not noticing my tasty Michelada was empty when the food came and never dropped by to see if I might like another for the next 30 minutes. The next time we saw her was when we finished our meal and had to call out to get her attention for a check. I should have written, \"Poor hospitality equals poor tip\". When she brought out our food I asked her how the seafood place was doing that moved into their old location. She replied smartly that \"She doesn't go that far south\", making me instantly feel that she just disrespected the entire neighborhood that I have enjoyed for over 50 years. I know she has gone that far south, she worked there for years. I had no idea that moving 3 and a half miles would change people so much. Not a lot of love tonight, via con dios amigos... I can name a half dozen competitors that love my business and sell Tecate.",

Suddenly, a charming old school Mexican food with amazing food, margaritas, and servers turns into a loud, chaotic cafeteria experience with a parking lot far too small to accommodate the droves of people who (thankfully) didn't know about the other location. While the food is still the best Mexican in the city and the margaritas on point, coming here has become more of an annoyance than a joy depending on the day. I'm sure you've gotten a lot of new business, and I'm happy for you for that... but this location stinks!!

When we sat at the bar, the chips and salsa were served promptly and so were our drinks.  If you like margaritas, I highly recommend the margarita made fresh and upgrade the tequila to Hornitos. Oh my gosh, so good!   For food, we ordered a kids meal which was a great size and price. I ordered the Salad Carbon with grilled chicken. That jalapeno ranch is delightful too! My husband ordered the Tacos Del Mar and was very satisfied.   Also, one of my favorite things about La Pinata is their decor. The little pinata that serves as their mascot is just the cutest.

They sound busy so I give them 10 extra to be safe.  We arrived to pick up our order.  It's wrong.  They ask us to wait for them to remake it.  Businesses, if you make a mistake, and your customers have to wait while you fix it, a good practice is to redeem the experience in some way so that they return.

In my opinion, if you're going to have a Mexican restaurant in AZ it better be good, but there are a lot of white people around so it makes sense that it's popular. Just don't go if you like authentic Mexican food- that's my advice.",

The supremo nachos with half machaca beef & half chicken were good and plentiful, but the chips were a little soggy.  I suggest skipping the chicken as the beef had much better flavor.  We also had a combo plate with a cheese enchilada, green corn tamale, and a guacamole taco.  All were good. It's way too much food for me though.  The tamale and taco were great the enchilada was average mainly because the sauce was just average.   Service was good. Good atmosphere.  We dined inside , but the patio looked nice with a fire.",

Usually, we get excellent service, but today we had a server that either was having a very bad day or was just not very good at his job. He wasn't very attentive and my girlfriend had to shout at him for a box as he was walking away with our check, which he walked by at least five times prior. Up until now we have had nothing but a great experience at this restaurant so I will stick to a five star review. Also we highly recommend the tio panchos pollo con queso, and the chorizo con huevos. Such a big portion for both!!",

( like why do you think we are here)? Put them down. A young lady went to hand us menus. No thanks... we are just having drinks.  You would think we did something wrong once we weren't eating  That was it.... never addressed us again. We easily could have had another one.... but no thanks. I'll go someone else.  I mean.... $20 for 2 drinks.... you could have made a killing on us.  There are people that eat and drink water only!  We normally do both!!

The food was so good! I had the create your own burro and the red sauce is divine. My husband got the mini chimichangas and loved them. Daniel kept coming back to check on us, fill up our waters and spark up some small talk. My husband and mom ordered margaritas and I was so jealous because they looked so good.

Cheese crisps are actually crisp!!!    Love that the new location has outdoor seating which the old one lacked.  The restrooms are a great improvement too.    Their enchilada and sauce is closer to the great stuff we got back in the 60's and 70's than on most cheese enchiladas in restaurants in recent decades (deep red/rust sauce, tasty cheese with tiny chopped onion, wrapped in good corn tortillas, topped with chopped black olives and white crumbled cheese)....not the same, but closer than most restaurants.  Shredded beef tacos are always good.  Salsa is good and they can bring algo mas picante.  My husband likes their machaca dinner and rarely strays from it.  We will be able to go more often now that they are way closer to our home.",

When we asked for more chips the much older waitress seem annoyed. Also when you ask for an order to go why not put the container in a bag other restaurants do.

Like many others I suppose, we have a favorite place for one dish and another place for another dish. We've only been there twice, each time we were a party of four so we tried several different dishes. Their cheese crisp is standard (not as good as Los Compadres if you like a really crispy tortilla which we do), tacos were just okay, the enchiladas were a bit better, the salsa was ordinary, beans seemed canned and the tamales were downright boring. The best dishes we had were the Pollo Azteca and the Pork Carnitas. We'll probably go back occassionally for those since they are walking distance from our house but when we want really good Mexican food, this is not our place.",

    "text": "The NEW La Pinata is a major disappointment !!  This is a great place if you like your food served tepid.  The WAS one of our favorite haunts ( 200+ visits over a number of years at the old location).  Since their move in October 2015, things have deteriorated.  The service is now mediocre and slow.  The noise level is profoundly louder.  The food is not served hot.  The lunch special menu variety is greatly reduced.   Our LAST visit at the new location was today (our third attempt for a satisfactory experience at the new location):  We asked our waiter to make sure our order was served hot.  The food was barely warm.  We opted to take our food home to heat it.  When we asked for a container to take salsa home - the waiter informed us that the charge would be 75 cents.  We were insulted, especially since we had unsuccessfully asked our waiter three times for our first salsa refill.  In spite of all of this the restaurant seems busier - since the move.   I am truly happy for the owners - but WE will not be returning.   Three strikes and you're out.   There are too many better alternatives.  For example: Jordan's Mexican Food on 7th Street has vastly superior service, good food, and is pleasantly quiet.  It is only about 5 minutes away from the new (not improved) La Pinata.",

    "text": "Currently studying for a rather important and daunting licensing exam and decided to take a break and get out of the house for dinner with my husband. We just moved here a few weeks ago and decided to try La Pinata for the first time! The decor was really cool, and the porch looked like a fun place to hang out and eat, but it was sort of chilly so we ended up sitting inside. I ordered a mango house margarita to drink. When it arrived, it was most definitely not mango (it was lime), but I was enjoying it, so I told the waitress not to worry about having it remade and to just remove the surcharge from our ticket for the flavoring. Apparently the manager wouldn't have that and said I either had to have my drink remade or I was paying for the surcharge. So, I had the drink remade. It was right the second time. I worked in food service in varying capacities for several years and would have never, ever said that to a customer, though. When our chips & chili con queso got to the table, there was a long black hair attached to one of the chips (I'm blonde, my husband has light brown hair). I didn't say anything because the impression I was given when I complained about the margarita was that the manager would likely think I was just looking for a write off on my ticket. When our food arrived, it was great. Not a single problem and everything tasted fantastic. When we were finishing up, though, an upset employee (manager maybe?) busted into the kitchen and LOUDLY (loud enough for the entire main dining room to hear and turn around) said: \"if you guys don't start cleaning off the f****** tables outside...\". Very, very unprofessional to use profane language when dealing with employees or coworkers, and even worse to say it loud enough that customers can hear. Our server, Lindsey, was great. She did everything right! Management, on the other hand, could use some worK. Certainly not the experience I was hoping for tonight.",

Don't waste your money, go somewhere else, especially if you have younger children with you. We waited about 10 minutes once we were seated to get our drink order. Then we waited another 15 minutes for those drinks to come and for our order to be taken. Once our food arrived the waitress never came back to fill our drinks or ask how everything was. Nothing special about the food itself. My mom and I both had bean burrito enchilada styles. Which I thought for $7 was kind of expensive because it was a large flour tortilla with a small amount of beans and bland sauce. I had to put a bunch of salsa on it to give it some flavor because all I taste was the tortilla. Also it was recommended by the waitress to wait to give my children milk until the food arrived so I thought okay, sure. However by that time they had drank water and didn't really drink the milk (which happened to be $2.50 for a children's milk!). With all of that being said we'll never go back. There are much better places around. Bad service, bland food, and expensive for what you get.",

We come here often and have never been disappointed in the quality of the food, generous portions, and friendly service of the staff.  100% of the time we take part of our meal home so the value equates closer to two meals for the price of one.  My husband always orders the same thing, and has for years, the Carne Macacha dinner!  I i'm more adventurous and have tried just about everything on the menu and it's all been delicious. I've never been disappointed in one single bite. Guacamole is outstanding! I had the chicken tortilla soup on our last visit and it what is hearty and delicious! It is topped with fresh avocado and tortilla strips and cheese and is even better than mine and that's saying a lot!  If you want nonsense real deal Mexican food, this is the place!",

Not to mention the lack of carryout now - I'm assuming due to the limited parking. If you're getting tired of waiting DON'T let them talk you into sitting at the community table! They say no reservations but apparently that doesn't apply to everyone. We saw a table for 5 + 2 high chairs in holding for over 30 min. When I asked about it they said that there was a party of 7 ahead of us but obviously they weren't there so clearly they do take reservations. Once we agreed to go to the community table then they divided the table up for two other parties of waiting customers . Go figure! I still won't eat Mexican food anywhere else but it's unfortunate that the customer service has declined so much.",

My palette is delicate and must say that this place was not what I expected. I e thing I did not like was the fact that a restaurant named La Pinata he no Horchata which was not a big deal, I w tea and water did the trick. I will definitely come back",

    "text": "Ok y'all. It's time to let you in on a not-so-secret secret. La Pinata is my new favorite food. Period. Some tips: make a reservation if you're going during prime dinner hours. I've enjoyed this food several times now, and have been known to speed walk from the parking lot to beat other patrons to a table. To be fair, they were speed walking too. Next tip: try to be seated in Jessie's section if possible. She's super nice, has a great smile, and will help you regain your faith in humanity. Tip her well, she deserves every penny. Next, order food. Seriously. Any food. No one I know has disliked anything. My personal favorite is the Steak Picado. Seems easy enough, but I have yet to find anyone who makes it better. Include a Bentley Margarita if you imbibe. Lastly: grab a mint on your way out. They look like peppermint but they're the buttercream wedding mints of your childhood dreams.   I'll see you there. And don't burn your mouth on the beans. Mmmm.",

    "text": "I never visited the old location, but I love the way they have redone the old Mary Coyle's building on 7th Avenue and turned it into a great, upscale Mexican food restaurant. We visited with a group of seven people and had an excellent experience. Service was fast and attentive and the food was excellent.  Between us we tried everything from the carne machaca dinner to the shrimp enchiladas suizas, the enchilada combo plate, and the chimichangas. (As a side note, its funny that La Pinata also lays some claim to the chimichanga as I'd thought the debate was strictly between Macayo's in Phoenix and El Charro in Tucson who both claim to have invented the dish. La Pinata is careful not to claim to have invented the chimichanga, but they certainly play up their connection to it).  Everyone was very happy with the food they had and most of us went home with enough to eat again the next day for lunch.  Now that they are in my neighborhood I have no doubt that I will be returning!",

Even the fish tacos are amazing! Always well maintained and always clean from the outside to the inside. If you love Mexican food and a great dining experience then you HAVE to try this place! During the cooler months, sitting outside is a treat with having patio heaters. Even when it's warm out they have misters to keep you cooler. The lighting creates a unique and warm dining experience. All in all I'll continue to eat at this establishment. You've gotta try it!",

Although they were closing in an hour, they greeted us promptly and welcomingly. Chips and salsa were brought to our table immediately along with waters all around. Anthony G helped us with our selections and checked in on us about every ten minutes. I was blown away by the service he gave. I was amazed at how quickly the food came and how nice and hot it was. Our orders were: Taco Salad (perfect size in a tall deep fried tortilla bowl), Chicken Quesadilla (huge), taquitos (for the little guy), and a relleno, taco, tostada (combo). My Green Chile used for the relleno was actually hot, spicy and something to talk about (they are not always this good). Everyone enjoyed the meal, but the best thing we had was dessert. Sopapillas... so soft, so warm. With powdered sugar and honey. Mmmmmm! We waited too long to try it, But now it will become one of our regular spots!",

Every time I order my food, I ask for no garnish. Not too big of a request, I just don't want a side salad with my Mexican food. It never fails, they GIVE ME IT ANYWAY!   EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.  It seems small but I come here often and it happens every time.   Second, the Grey haired older lady always has a shit attitude. Not once has she been pleasant to anyone. I don't know what her deal is but she makes the place look bad. As harsh as it sounds.   Besides that, like I said earlier, the food is amazing. The waiters are awesome. The ladies who refill chips and drinks are always on it! If the kitchen could get their shit together a little and if the lady could pull the stick out, this place would be perfect.  UPDATE! La Pinata is still my favorite Mexican restaurant of all time. I've upgraded my review to 4 stars. They've gotten a lot better about not giving me garnish. They recognize me because I've complained about it so much . The white haired lady is still grumpy and unapproachable. I feel like the bun on her head is going to unravel and turn into an evil serpent and kill us all!! Besides that, LOVE THE FOOD! Oh, and the bearded bartender... Damn! Sexy!",

Usually, this dish is very neat, tiny rolled enchiladas with a dollop of sour cream on top.  Not this one.  The enchiladas were huge, smothered in delicious verde sauce and covered with sour cream ... literally, couldn't even see the enchiladas underneath.  So awesome.  Chicken was tender (though I don't think all white meat but it worked).  Arroz was moist and flavorful. The black beans were plentiful.  This place is the bomb.  Plus, I decided to take home an order of their Albondigas soup, something I love but have difficulty finding a good source for it.  This place is it.  The broth was delicious, just enough cilantro and heat to satisfy and the albondigas themselves were ping pong ball-sized meatballs filled with flavor.  Service and prices were great.  My go-to Mexican restaurant in Phoenix.",

Everything came out sizzling hot, fresh, and absolutely delicious. The service, although it was a busy Sunday night, was also on point.  The free chips and salsa were great. Since it was busy, we waited for about 10-15 mins for a party of two. However, once we were seated, our server was very attentive & took our orders right away. There is a small parking surrounding the restaurant. I haven't tried the drinks yet since there is a bar, but I will definitely be back!",

Chips and salsa are made fresh daily, sometime more often.  The place is spotlessly clean, the service is top notch and the food is the best!  The chef, Peter, is usually wandering around kibitzing with the new patrons as well as his regulars.  He's a hoot!  Eat on the patio if the weather permits.  It's beautiful with a large fireplace and flickering lights all over.  The food portions are more than generous and you can tell the ingredients are top quality.  If you have room, try the \"baked ice cream\" or the sopapias with honey or chocolate.  Go to this place once and you can be sure it will become one of your regulars.",

I informed each one of them and one was upset, as he said, \"I know the family.\" I reported this infraction of Yelp's standards to Yelp and they removed his negative comments from the reviews of Peter B.'s competitors.

La Pinata, having opened in 1970, is a Phoenix landmark in the field of restaurants. It offers traditional Sonoran-style Mexican cuisine, and staple of any Phoenician's diet. The food is always excellent, and always has very nice presentation.  Their new location, Missouri and 7th, the old site of Mary Coyle's is smaller than the original location, but has a similar feel and atmosphere. I've had the pleasure of knowing a couple of the owners for many years, and was very sad to see Leonard go a little while ago, as he made my experience even better, but I still enjoy visiting whenever I can immensely.    I will never stop coming to La Pinata, as I have been coming here since I was very young, so it will continue to be apart of my life.",

The entrance is in the back and has a very pretty Spanish style garden theme.   We had great seats inside. The space is just the right size but they also have outdoor seating. Loved the decor, the atmosphere and the food, of course!  The server was so nice and helpful. Asked a few questions and I was sold on the steak fajitas. They are covered in a super yummy sauce. Not dry at all. The veggies underneath were perfectly cooked. Large portions. I had to take some home.   Everything tasted amazing. By the time we finished our meal, the place was packed and more customers were waiting for tables.   We will definitely make the drive out here for those fajitas!!!!",

Really haven't found anything bad. Portions are huge, so if you are thinking about sharing, this is the place to do it. Rice and beans are very good. They do offer black beans also. Plates come to your table piping hot, so be aware. The salsa with your chips is a little in the hot side, this is the way I like it.  Service is good, can get busy there so sometimes you might need a little patients.",

This place is absolutely delicious and has the quality, portion size, and flavor I've grown to love back home.  One of the best things about this place, in my opinion,  is there is generally never more than a 15 minute wait given the ample space and seating of the restaurant. The staff is also highly attentive and very friendly. Once you are seated, prepare to devour some seriously delicious salsa. Pro tip: don't eat too much of the salsa as the portions here are very generous.  As far as the food goes, I always end up getting the fajitas as they are crazy delicious. They also seem to always be perfectly cooked. Never over done! I highly recommend them. Drink selection is pretty standard for a Mexican restaurant. I've had several of their margaritas and they are generally quite tasty without being ruined with too much sugar.  All in all, if you want some delicious and hearty Mexican food at an affordable price, this is pretty much my go to in the area. Definitely try it out! Your tummy will thank you :).",

My fav is the ground beef taco (and I don't even eat ground beef) and the cheese enchilada. The portions are huge so you can always share a combo. The chips and salsa are a meal all by themselves so make sure you save room.   Now for my no go's at here. The margaritas. Not my fav. For many reasons all the way from mix, to flavor to price. Stick to a beer or wine if you want a cocktail. The guacamole is also not my fav. It's fresh but bland so I don't think it's worth the price of a side of guacamole.   Otherwise come eat here the food is good you will be satisfied and you will have leftovers!",

False advertising!   If we can still order before close, the specials should be honored. The waiter had to adjust the ordering, to honor what the menu says. The owners or management need to straighten this out.    And ECfive stars except for the deceptive practice  ******  Here again on taco Tuesday.   3 Mexican beers on special all night.   Nice.   Inexpensive tacos.  The shredded beef was a bit salty, but with cold beer, plenty of lettuce, tomato and cheese it was just fine.  Friendly waiter and Stanley Cup playoffs on the bar TV---all good",

Recommendations include the Chorizo and eggs platter, carne asada burrito, and machacca burrito.   We've had Maggie be our sever a few occasions and she is tremendous.  Always offering recommendations, very personable and conversational.  The host (who I assume is one of the owners as well) is also wonderful to talk with.  One tip - be sure to ask for their hot salsa with your chips if you are a fan of spicy foods!",

The red chili beef is now very greasy- total let down. My wife had the pork carnitas burro- the pork was SO dry and bland. What happened???

I did not like how they would not allow me to take home a meal off the children's menu for my daughter, even though the rest of our order was well above $60 but I guess that is their policy. Other than that, and the lack of attractive female bartenders, is the only qualm I have with this place.",

We were totally bummed to hear they were closing but then excited to hear they would take over the Mary Coyle/Appettitos building.  I was glad to have some competition for Sylvia's.  It us nice they got a regulation replica sign for the place because that is vintage stuff.  They did a really nice job of making use of the space there and I think they might have added some dining space.  I was disappointed that the agave margaritas are gone as are some of the other menu favorites.   Thank goodness they still have the machaca chimichangas because they are AWESOME and always have been.   I miss the kitsch of the old place in its 70's vibe but this is nice.

The atmosphere was rather dull and I honestly was underwhelmed from the reviews I read and the 4 star rating. The service was decent and happy hour menu had some good items available. I loved the reg. queso and the fried flour tortilla chips served  with it! Made me think I was back home in Texas! The salsa is a typical traditional red salsa that was good, but nothing to rave about. I had the la pina cocktail that was surprisingly not too sweet, but not sure if it's worth $9. I shared beef fajitas with the hubby and we were surprised with the restaurants' version of fajitas. It was literally slow cooked brisket style fajitas with a brown gravy on top? But it did come with a generous amount of refried beans and rice. Our meal came with 3 tortillas and we asked for more to take home with our leftovers. We were charged for $1.50 for 2 tortillas... I've NEVER had to pay extra for tortillas lol. I wasn't even informed it would cost extra especially since they weren't anything special . I think it's kind of silly that a restaurant at this price point feels the need to charge their customers who probably spends a good amount of money to dine at their establishment. As a couple we spent $50 with a tip and have gotten more value and satisfaction at other Mexican restaurants. Was this place terrible? No. was it worth the money? No. Was it a fun and cool atmosphere? No. 2 months ago I ordered Uber eats from a Mexican restaurant at the same price point and similar style and got waaaay more of a value and was super pleased with just a to- go order! I think that says a lot.",

Of the three entrees, the bean burrito enchilada style was the best. Their enchilada sauce is pretty good. Their salsa is decent and the service was quick. I am glad this spot opened up because the neighborhood could use a good sonoran style mexican food restaurant.",

My husband got a beef chimichanga and I got bean and cheese burrito, which we both enjoyed. Chips and salsa arrived immediately; the salsa tastes sweeter than most and is equally flavorful.

We ordered the red chile combo, the taco combo and chicken fajitas.  The red chile was delicious and they didn't skimp on the meat like a lot of places do and give you mostly just sauce. Only reason for not giving a 5-star rating is that we got beef tacos instead of chicken like we ordered. They were still very good though. Order was ready at the time promised and staff was very pleasant. Will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Deliciousness - 3/5  Happiness - 3/5  The inside definitely doesn't match the outside. It is very swanky and cool, with an impressive-looking bar in the middle.  We went with a big group. Thus, we got a wide range of food - none of it bad, but plenty of it was mediocre. The chimichangas are darn-near-perfect. Too many places lack the crunch a chimi should have. They have managed to maintain the crunchy taste while still loading it with cheese and sauce. The machaca meat was also pretty good, as were the tacos. We ordered guacamole as and appetizer and a few different types of margaritas, none of which were particularly memorable. The waiter was attentive, but over-sold the spice level of the food (I found very few things to be spicy. In fact, I was piling on the pre-meal salsa to my burrito to get the needed kick!). A lot of the dinner entrees also require extra for rice and beans. That said, the entrees are so big and hearty, virtually none of us finished our complete meals (including the heavy eaters in our group!).   Also, I love tamales, but don't eat pork. Sadly, this disqualifies many a tamale place and La Pinata joins the group (they do have a green corn tamale too, but I simply don't like green corn ones).   The kids meal is too expensive at six dollars, and also overloaded with beans and rice.   The bottom line is it's nice food with big portions. The price is also very reasonable (other than the kids meals). It's definitely not the best Mexican I have had in Phoenix, but it has more than enough unique menu items to make it good to go into any good Mexican rotation.",

I was excited when this restaurant opened in my neighborhood ~ they took quite some time to offer \"to go\" food. I can appreciate  getting your bearings, but as a pregnant woman on strict bed rest who was craving Mexican food, it was disappointing that they were not able to serve us.  Their food is decent ~ tex~ mex only, if that's what you're in to. We don't go often but tonight after screwing up an at home dinner we thought we'd go. Now at home with twins, we also don't go out often but order to go food frequently.  When we ordered two meals and a kids quesadilla, we were told that they do not offer kids's meals to go.....because they do not have containers for kid's size meals. WHAT??? You can't offer me a kids quesadilla to go because the container is not the right size?  When pushed they said \"no\" because they just don't offer kids meals to go. So regular meals to go are finally ok, but no kids. If you offer it on your website, why don't you offer it to go? The manager, Terri, said that when the owner tells her something, she just does it, no questions asked.  So she couldn't even give me a a logical reason for not making me this kids meal.  With only decent food and ridiculous \"rules\" of business that you can't justify or explain, I will happily take my family's business, kids included, elsewhere.",
