When we arrived to pickup this evening, no record of our order.  They blamed a change in how orders are handled.  No acknowledgement of our inconvenience.  That is disappointing from a customer service standpoint.  There are lots of choices out there.  It will be awhile before we make this choice again, even though we enjoyed our food when we finally got it.",

Last couple of times we have eaten at PF Changs and ordered the Shrimp Dumplings we noticed that they have changed how they make them. They used to have chunks of shrimp mixed in with the ground up shrimp filling. The texture and mouth feel and taste were all different in the past from what they are now. Kind of disappointed in this appetizer now. It is not being made the same way it used  to be made. Wondering if anyone else has  noticed this.",

    "text": "I generally don't write reviews about chains that I rarely visit, but sometime rely on when I in a pinch while travelling... but this was just to classic to not share for posterity...   Sit down at the bar (you know travelling by myself) - looked like the right spot with appropriate elbow room for Me, Myself, and I, but lo and behold picked the spot with the dark mushroom on the counter, and the sticky hidden mess where I put my rental car keys.  Nice enough waitress/bartendress offers me a drink, I get a slightly chilled (54 degress perhaps) Malbec, which was good.  Ordered my peculiar dish (the only reason I ever come to this chain) - stock velvet Kung Pao with loads of veggies added to make it almost healthy (minus the heartache inducing sodium levels).  Figured it would be all normal like it usually is in a chain like this....  consistency for the sake of authenticity and the fact that Chandler is almost devoid of good cuisine.  First dish out - fast.  No veggies, they send it back... back in 5 minutes, chicken is not stock velvet, I didn't notice at first... waitress did, plates sent back... 10 minutes later.... food now in front of me to consume.  No problem, I can handle two screw ups, I will be gone soon from this place.  However my journey has just begun....   Young manager comes by, says sorry I talked to the \"chef\" and chucks a free appetizer card at me.  Good only for Chandler...  I let the waitress know later in a nice manner that they can keep it, because I don't live here.  She says oh, let me get you something else.  Then ensues some discussion with suave young manager and older manager..  older manager comes by and tells me that being that I didn't order an appetizer I couldn't redeem the appetizer card.  He repeats this twice because I couldn't fathom that he would be saying that the card that they just gave me, which I didn't want, I was now in trouble for trying to use???  He finally understands my confusion... and says, oh I will be back.  He comes back with a appetizer card I could use anywhere in the world!!! Yippeeee!!  And then he gives me his card in case I have trouble getting a table when I want to use the appetizer card back home - because he opened all the restaurants up there.  Trouble getting a table at PF Changs?????? !  I left going holy mother of cows, then I saw the UFOs over Phoenix and realized I was in the Twilight zone.",

    "text": "We used to go to PF Chan's once a year or so, back in California. The meal was always good and we enjoyed ourselves. I told my husband I was craving Chinese food and this is where he took me. I was pretty excited.  We were seated promptly, and we were asked our drink order right away. I was having trouble deciding on our meal (we always share) and the waitress (SUPER NICE) started on the egg rolls for us. When I finally decided on our Chang's spicy chicken, I called the waitress over, and she told me one second. she came back right away with our egg rolls. They were delicious!!! defiantly the best part of the meal. we waited a little while then got our chicken. When deciding what to order, I had mentioned to the waitress that I didn't want anything too spicy, and she advised against the kung pao chicken, and said the Chang's chicken won't be too spicy. It was pretty freaking spicy!! I couldn't imagine how spicy the kung pao chicken would be. They knew we were splitting the meal, so they separated the rice into two bowls for us. The presentation of the chicken was pretty lack luster.... it didn't look special, just chunks of chicken in an orangish sauce, and it tasted about as good as it looked unfortunately..... The only reason I am giving this two stars is because of our waitress. She was very personable and nice, but her positive attitude did not make up for the meal that we paid $25 for. it was worth $10 at most. Very disappointed. I guess we will just have to go back to the one in California next time we are there.",

We went later in the evening, so the location wasn't too busy. We were greeted and seated almost immediately by Barbi who actually ended up being our server. Barbi was busy as she was the only server left on the floor and though we arrived when she got a little bit of a rush; well, she treated us like we were her only table! Before I knew it, we had our appetizers along with a second set of our soft drinks waiting for us for when we finished our first!! I like that she did this because, she knew that she had gotten busy with a small closing rush and she prepared us to have everything we could possibly want so that we didn't have to wait!! Barbi continued to check on us throughout our meal and was just overall wonderful! She was friendly, polite, when I asked about certain menu items she took the time to explain regardless of the fact that she was busy. Of course the food was amazing but at this location; the food gets the credit it deserves by being brought to you promptly and with a friendly face! Was she busy with several tables? Sure. Did she give us just the right amount of attention to make sure we had a nice, intimate meal with just the right amount of service? Most definitely!! I would definitely return to THIS P.F. Chang's and definitely recommend to others. There were a few servers there who were closing down their tables and they took the time to help Barbi when needed (our appetizers) and they were just as helpful and friendly!   *We had gone in with a gift card from our previous experience at a different location and I have to say overall I am pleased with the companies outlook on long term retention!! Sure, someone reaching out to say they are '..sorry to hear...' is always nice but them taking the time to try to allow us a nice relaxing dinner like paid for... well that is priceless!! Thank you to the Customer Relations team and Tawnya who helped us to finally find a great location and enjoy the wonderful meal and service!! Definitely will recommend this place to family and friends' for whatever events they may have coming up as well!! Barbi would be a great server for such events!!",

Soup (had the hot and sour- very good!) then lettuce wraps (good as usual).  Unfortunately, when the entree arrived, the restaurant was unable to provide rice for several orders.  The official word was \"ran out- cooking more\".   3 couples were shorted rice. We waited a bit, but then started eating our cooling main dishes. After reminding the server  that rice never came out, we suggested to forget it, and just adjust the bill somehow.  Our server was very huffy and hostile and ignored that. She insisted that rice was coming.  A bit later she brought out some rice.  The main dishes were already eaten.  Pointless.  No apology-  She merely wanted to know if we wanted to take the rice home.       Guess we could have insisted on talking to a manager, but didn't bother.   Disappointed in the server's \"tough cookies\" attitude.  How does a restaurant \"run out\" of a key dinner component at 6 p.m.?",

Plan ahead as the place fills up quickly.   My only negative comment would be the extensive \"dust bunnies\" behind the bar on the ceiling.

Everything that made PF Changs a go to Chinese food spot 15 years ago has completely disappeared.  The food is sub par to say the least and I am positive the business survives on its ever aging senior regulars and young couples with coupons.    I did not make it past my appetizer when I completely gave up on this place.  The \"handmade\" steamed shrimp dumplings tasted soggy and frozen.  I couldn't even taste the little micro bits of shrimp in the soggy wonton wraps because the dumplings arrived coated in a cold oily black peppercorn sauce.   So.... Ummm ... Mister or miss chef ... What happens when you eat two tablespoons of whole black peppercorns in a sauce???????? I'll tell you, you can't taste anything to else for the next ten hours!!! Extraordinarily poor composition of sauce and plating.    In addition to worst food I've tasted in years, the bar service was even worse.  The bartender made it fairly clear she was \"opening\"'tomorrow and made cleaning and preparing the bar for the next day her priority over serving guests.  Hopefully she ll be a better server tomorrow.   If you have taste buds and care about your waistline, avoid this travesty.",

    "text": "As a foodie, I usually prefer local places instead of chains. However, PF Changs does a really good job for a chain restaurant. This location is very well managed. Inside, it has modern Asian themed decor, and is a bit more upscale than other chain restaurants. It's fairly loud inside, especially later in the evening.  Our server was above average. Better than most chains, yet nothing that really said \"wow.\"  The seared tuna was solid. Served traditional style with sesame seeds, ponzu sauce, and chives. The tuna was fresh and cooked properly.  I had a cup of egg drop soup, which was also a solid choice. It had a good amount of eggs in it, and wasn't overly salty like a lot of places.  For my entree, I had orange chicken with white rice. The chicken was moist and flavored appropriately. It was all white meat with no grit. The steamed rice was a good accompaniment. Portion sizes are generous here, making it very affordable.",

Everything was up to par, server was polite and attentive, atmosphere was pleasant, and the food quality didn't disappoint. I always appreciate when I ask for a special order, I wanted to add shrimp to my dish, and the don't seem to mind. We were pleasantly surprised with the tempura green bean appetizer. Mains were tasty and by the time we got to desert we were pretty full with leftovers. We decided to get a small cobbler and a lava cake, both were pretty small but they were perfectly sized for our stuffed selves. Overall, still a nice place to take a date out on a Friday night. If it's been a while, you'll enjoy it just as much as you remember.",

First owned by Paul Fleming and sold awhile ago this restaurant has not changed the menu much ( thank God).You can still find really good Asian Fusion food all over the country. ( I know I used to travel for business).  I was here at the Chandler location meeting my friend for dinner. Our waitress was fabulous. Smart, funny and really nice.  She checked on me  while I waited about 1/2 hour for my girlfriend to arrive.  Dinner was amazing. I had the Shrimp Lo Mein which I am addicted too. My girlfriend had a dinner portion of the lettuce wrap.  We both also had desert. Service was fast and our food came out hot just like it should. Our waitress checked on use frequently and didn't mind that we sat there and talked for an additional two hours after we were done eating catching up.  I see some of the bad reviews for this location, but for me I have to disagree. Good food, great service and wonderful atmosphere.",

So, then, you've been seated. It turns out the wait staff is very nice and very professional. A+ here.  We tried the PF Chang combo for two. The egg drop soup was fantastic. Someone apparently dropped an entire bag of salt in the hot n sour soup. I'd avoid that. And the dynamite shrimp appetizer was dy-no-mite! Very yummy.  We should have stopped here. The clumsy guy with the salt was back again. My Singapore street noodles had to have enough salt to de-ice the roads in upstate New York for a full winter. Couldn't finish it. By comparison, the Mongolian Beef was less salty, but it's possible a bag of salt might be less salty.  I'd write more but I'm gonna watch the hostess put on makeup at the front counter now. *sigh*",

The server I had was great. He was very nice, professional and went out of his way to meet specific food allergies and gave the table two types of iced tea because we couldn't decide which one sounded the best.  2. The food was good. I expected it to be better than Panda Express. It was. I personally like Pei Wei and found it slightly better. Pretty much the same when it comes to price.  3. The store is really nice, clean and welcoming. Again, the big thing for me is clean.  No for the disappointment that will be the main reason why I will not return to this location  CONS 1. Staff. When I got there with my friend, it was dead. I was sitting near the bar and what appeared to be the To-Go/Dishwasher entrance to the kitchen. There must of been at least 7 staff standing around conversing, laughing and joking. Two staff in particular were looking at customers, pointing and laughing. This is not appropriate at all. The other unsettling thing about this is I had what appeared to be the dishwasher (16-17 year old guy) standing at the entrance of the dish washing area just looking at me for over 9 minutes with his red rubber gloves on watching me eat. Then another staff came up and kept looking at me with him while pointing and laughing, every single time I put food in my mouth. I was going to say something right then and there, but it got really busy and people were running around trying to get there work done.  If it wasn't for that one CON, this would have been a 4-5 star experience.",

Nice and clean, crispy.  Easy to enjoy.  And the sauce is just fantastic.  I ordered the gluten free Spicy Chicken and it was EXACTLY what I was craving.  I had enough for lunch today!  I will definitely be back.  When I asked for more sauce for the chicken, they brought a nice, big bowl at no extra charge.  No roll of the eye.  Just simple, kind service... a dying art these days.

I asked the hostess if we had a waiter. She went to the back to try the find \"her\". It was obvious the waiter was not around so... We went to the bar thinking we could get immediate service there. Just before we sat down the bar tender walked off. We waited another 5 min which may seem short but is a long time in the restaurant industry. He didn't come back.  I was really craving lettuce wraps but my husband insisted we leave. On our way out I told the hostess we couldn't get any service so we were going to just leave. She didn't try to stop us or apologize. My husband stayed back to speak with her and the waiter that had been hanging out at the hostess stand. It was not pleasant. The hostess didn't seem bothered at all. Never apologized, never offered to get her manager, etc. What a waste.",

    "text": "The only reason I had come this evening was to take advantage of a BOGO deal and it turned into a fairly frustrating evening.   To start, the service was really slow considering that there were only two other tables. Yes we came later in the evening than typical but we were not the last table to be seated and it shouldn't have been, at least, 10 minute intervals between seeing our server.  I had to remind my server of a cup of soup I ordered that was brought out after the entrees. I should have had them just take the soup off the bill since what they brought out tasted like it had been watered down to stretch it to last the remainder of the night. The short rib appetizer and the entrees were actually very good and tasty but it was not nearly enough to make up for the rest of my experience.  If you recall there were only two other tables and one of those happened to be wrapping up their meal at the same time as myself and my boyfriend. I reviewed the bill before placing my card for payment and waited, a fair bit, before the waiter came to grab it. After processing the payment and bringing back the bill I see that my amount was different, as was the items listed, and the name on the card inside. I notice that the table finishing up near by is filling out their bill and I send my boyfriend over to check to see if they have our card instead. Turns out they did.  Had I not been paying better attention then that other customer AND my waiter, some stranger would have walked out with my debit card, and I theirs. I get that sometimes things are crazy and waiters can get switched around, but this was two tables with plenty of wait time in between for the waiter. After realizing that this other person already filled my receipt out I proceeded to wait another almost 15 minutes before ANYONE resurfaced to help me out and fix it.  Needless to say I won't be going back since this place can't be trusted to be on top of their game on a super slow, weekday night.",

No one that was there was before us. I will never go to here again and I would gladly like to talk to the manager about how those 3 hostess did their job and treated us.",

The surf and turf was tasty but I'm pretty sure they tried to pass crawfish off as lobster and there definitely wasn't enough protein on that plate to just a $25 price tag.",

From our table, we watched a group of male servers just hanging out and conversing as we sat patiently waiting for our server to come back and take our food order. The manager noticed us looking around and finally came over. We informed her we were just looking for our server. He came over right away after that. The manager cleared some of our appetizer plates and asked if our server had more drinks on the way. I told her \"Who knows. We haven't seen him.\" She made sure we had drinks right away. The 2nd star is for the server that actually noticed the \"ask for ID\" on the back of my card when paying and asked for it! Not many places do. I really appreciated that. Next time I will drive to the location at Kierland Commons when I am craving PF Changs. Martino at the Scottsdale location really set the bar high! His service is flawless. Perhaps he can show the Chandler team what top notch service is all about!",

After standing there for a couple of minutes in silence, she looks up at me and says \"just one?\" I think Firehouse subs is better at greeting customers, which really isn't a hard thing. Even a response to my greeting would have been better than nothing.   Now I am standing over here by the order pick up and not a single employee has said a word to me.. At least 10 people have walked by and not even one has asked if I've been helped. I understand I'm not dining in but is it hard to treat every guest with simple kindness?   This is hard for me as the food here is amazing! I feel cheated though as I think plenty of fast food restaurants would treat a customer better. I am a well dressed outgoing person so I cant imagine how someone who didn't look like their \"target audience\" would be treated.",

On this late lunch stop a few days ago, I elected a lunch combo with a sushi roll plus a couple of crab wontons.  It was quite frankly the perfect size for lunch and considering I was eating sushi at a respectable restaurant, it was priced very reasonably.   The roll was good.  I love sriracha, and this roll used it inventively.  The crab wontons were also quite good.  I love those things and I could have eaten 20 more of them :).      I enjoyed the meal and my Tsingtao was ice cold.     The restaurant was mostly empty.   While my meal arrived quickly -- IE the sushi chef prepared it quickly -- I would not say the remainder of the service was as quick as I would have expected.      All told, this was a good lunch.   I would definitely go back to this PF Chang's, and I would not hesitate to stop in at other PF Chang's locations in other cities on my travels.",

Unfortunately, the quality seems to be declining. After three days of constantly visiting the porcelain throne, I called the restaurant and talked to a manager named Brad.  He said he would file a \"claim\" and I gave him my name, etc.  By the way he handled my call to inform them so that other customers would not be affected, I got the impression that he is no stranger to complaints about the food. It is a shame.  They used to be great. Fortunately, there are so many other restaurants here in the Valley from which to choose.",

The server was extremely personable & very knowledgeable about the menu. I started off with a Key Lime Pie cocktail,  it was really sweet so I wouldn't do more than one or two but definitely worth a try. For the appetizer I did the Gluten-Free Chicken Lettuce Wraps and for my entree the Gluten-Free Lemon Chicken. Both were very delectable and I would definitely recommend both dishes. Unfortunately I was too full to get dessert this time, however if you go just for dessert only or have room for something sweet I would recommend the Banana Spring Rolls.  Side note about this particular location: it is a very busy and the wait times can get a bit ridiculous.  If they accept call ahead seating/reservations I would definitely recommend it, or just go at an odd time of day.",

Also, I'd like to clarify that I am giving this rating based on service and not necessarily on food, though the food was on par and as expected.  We had a great time at PF Changs today... only reason we went here was because my sis was craving \"chinese\".  Anyway, our server J was awesome and so was the manager (with whom we had a lengthy, funny, conversation about burgers, of all things).  The food was as expected but I was mostly impressed w/ our server who, when I told him in a joking manner that I might start gnawing on his arm because I was so hungry, he said, \"give me a sec\" and ran back to the kitchen and had them whip up our meal pronto.  It came out quickly and everything except the Buddha's feast was exactly as ordered.  Our server was not a fake friendly guy, he was just real though friendly, funny, and quick.  He didn't do any of that annoying interrupting stuff (I hate that, esp when you're in a deep conversation with someone and they interrupt you to ask if you want water.. yes, it's empty 'cuz I've been suckin' it down so please go for it) and walked by often enough so that if we needed something, we could grab him easily.  My martini (Dragon something or other) was pretty good, though a bit too sweet for my taste to order again.  My eggplant was really good (then again I was really hungry).  But like I said, our server was great and provided the kind of service that makes you want to come back because it's rare to find.  Yeah.. I know, I wasn't expecting that at all.  Also, they had a decently sized Gluten Free offerings for those with Gluten allergies - that's great to find!",

    "text": "I like to think of Chang's as the Area 51 of Asian dining. Mainly because the executive chef is constantly changing the menu, and whenever this happens, my favorite dishes become conspicuously absent from the menu. That is, until you ask the server for your menu-absent favorite.  Ahem, excuse me, \"What happened to the grilled salmon?\" \"Oh we still serve it - its just not on the menu anymore.\"  Why is this, I wonder?  Apparently, there was room on the menu for the shellfish disclaimer. And the peanut allergy disclaimer. And the gluten intolerance warning. And, how we should notify our server if anyone in our party has a food allergy.  Oh, and I almost forgot, the undercooked meats warning - the one about how eating meats cooked rare may increase my chances of a foodborne illness.  I imagine a conversation between Chang's lawyers and the executive chef going something like this:  Legal team:      \"We're afraid we're going to need about six inches on the bottom of the menu        for all the legal disclaimers, can you get rid of some of the entrees?\"  Executive chef:        \"I suppose I could pare down the menu if need be.\"  Legal team:        \"Yeah, well start by losing the spicy eggplant with ground chicken - no one eats         that shit, and get rid of that weird salmon dish too!\"  Chef:           \"Why yes, I believe I can get rid of those and a few more while I'm at it.\" [gigantic ass-kissing sound in background]  I'm afraid we'll soon see a day when the menu has no food items at all - supplanted by a dining contract, replete with fine print, indemnification sections, and hold harmless clauses and all thanks to diners who are more hungry for lawsuits than they are a great dining experience.  The world's getting weirder by the moment.  In the meantime, if you like eggplant, they make one fine dish that kinda-sorta makes up for the legal warnings - the ones that also hoodged out my grilled salmon.",

The orange peel chicken was just ok but it was chicken breast so that's a plus, the low mein was good wasn't too strong a flavor, fried rice was good as well not too much soy sauce not too little just right, the veggie spring rolls were not to my liking there were some pretty big chunks of cabbage in them flavor was ok though. The biggest PLUS for this establishment is the service it was perfect, got our refills without being too intrusive, we weren't bothered every minute about how the food is while we're still eating. Our server even removed a shrimp dish from our bill that we didn't like.",

    "text": "I've been to this place a couple of times, mainly for team lunches, so I thought I'd review it this time.  When you walk in, you get that classy Asian vibe.   It's fairly upscale looking.  But the first thing I noticed was how few Chinese people there are.  I think I was the only one.    We had the chicken lettuce wrap for the appetizer. The chicken was not as tender as some other lettuce wraps I've had, and the soysauce may have overpowered the taste of the chicken.  But it was edible.  I tried one of the lunch bowls: pepper steak.  It said it should by spicy, but I couldn't feel the spice.  The beef was cooked well, but they ODed on the sauce making it too salty.    I thought the dessert shooters were really cute.  It's a good portion for those who want to have some desserts but not overstuff ourselves after a heavy main course.  The tiramisu shooter isn't as good.  But then it's not expected to have a tiramisu flavor in a Chinese oriented place.  It tastes more like a tiramisu cake instead of the traditional soft and creamy tiramisu I'm used to at an Italian restaurant.  What I do like about the restaurant is the different tea flavors you can choose from.  And they bring it out for you in a traditional Chinese/Japanese like teapot to set the Asian mood.  It's a good alternative for a tea house.   Pf Chang's is good to have food for the people who like the Chinese-American fusion.  It may be a good place to start if you're scared of \"real\" Chinese food.  It's not a good place for authentic Chinese food.  And the price is more than I would pay for average tasting lunch.",

Appetizers this visit were crab wonton and pork egg rolls.  I would eat here more often if they had a little larger portion size or egg drop soup was complimentary with entree's. It baffles me why we pay so much and the plate is overloaded with the rice noodles.  The server was polite and complemented my son on his mannerism and behavior which was lovely to hear. For $10.50 a cocktail I rather hold off for a bar or cocktail lounge, I would also suggest more drinks suited for sake, less sangria and tequila margaritas, I'll enjoy those when we eat @ Z'Tejas. 1 more suggestion for PF's is having a signature, yes the lettuce wraps are a fan fav. But I would really like to see a signature \"must have\" sake cocktail or a \"must try green tea dessert\".  Just sayin'",

After returning from the manager consultation, she said we are not seating outside right now, without offering any reason.  Food was ok except one dish I used to come here for, Beef ala Sichuan.  The Chinese dish this emulates is supposed to have the beef, carrots and celery cut in matchstick pieces, with the beef fried until crusty/chewy. They used to do it this way.  It was great and something you couldn't do at home.  Now they have the carrots shredded, the celery bias cut, and the beef in 3/4  x  1 1/4 inch slices. I can do better at home. Second visit with problems like this. Won't be coming back.  Oh and they seem to have a bot replying to their Yelp reviews.",

Over the course of 4 years, they made a couple minor mistakes and would kindly comp us a free appetizer or not charge us for the meal if it was made wrong. However, the menu has changed and the service has gone WAY down hill!! On 3 occasions, in fact 3 times in a row of dining here, I was served fish in my vegetarian meals. Another time my friend was served an egg product in her vegan salad, and the last straw was that we were served PORK in our vegetarian spring rolls! Not even one of those last 5 visits did the server or manager offer a refund or give a crap about how dissatisfied we were! I am only sorry for giving them 5 chances to make it right. I will never step foot in this restaurant again, thanks to their new \"customer doesn't matter\" policy. Maybe someday they will go back to their old ways, which were way better!",

I have had the worst roast duck in PF Chang, house special pork rib was aweful. I don't understand how they can screw up such simple dish. My wife and I can make better dish than them. Price is way too expensive. I can easily find a bundle of Chinese restaurant better than PF Chang around Phoenix area. Sigh",

    "text": "I thought the Great Wall of Chocolate dish at PF Changs was really good. I shared with six other members of my family and we still couldn't finish it. It's huge. It's really sweet but for all you chocolate lovers, I bet you'd love it. I thought that this chocolate cake was one of the best cakes I've had; it had a chocolate sort of cream in between the slices.   I also enjoy eating the mini desert of The Great Wall of Chocolate if I can't finish a whole serving of the gigantic cake at one time. This small amount is the right serving for not having enough chocolate and having too much chocolate. It's just right. Other restaurants don't serve this portion of a dessert, which makes it cool in a way and different.   I love the to go containers they have for the left over cake. I could eat the rest of my cakes for three days after I had it. It was like a never ending chocolate fantasy.   The prices are fairly reasonable for the amount of cake I got . They could go down a little bit but there's three days worth out of that cake so I can't complain too much. The price for the mini dessert is cheap but could be lowered as well because of the small portion given.   This dessert is, by far, the best dessert on the menu. I've tried the banana spring rolls and the New York style cheesecake; they're pretty good but when I'm in the mood for chocolate, these two dishes don't compare. I don't think they have the same creamy texture and they're not the same size as the Great Wall of Chocolate. They're tiny compared to the chocolate cake.  Anyone, who goes to PF Changs, needs to try this dessert. It's a must on the menu. Nothing compares to it.",

    "text": "Whenever I go here I feel like everyone knows a secret about this place that I don't. The food isn't Asian in any meaningful sense, and it isn't particularly good in general. So why is it packed out and the dishes so relatively expensive? I just had the new Lemongrass Prawn, which was pretty good as far as that goes, but not even remotely Chinese. The fake Asian decorations are more annoying to me than anything, and the dim ambience is destroyed by the TVs playing at the bar since they can be seen from just about every table in the restaurant. The general pretense of classiness was ruined for me when I went to the bathroom only to find spanish profanities written all over the stall. Someone in my party was served the wrong dish, and it took a while for us to get the right one. We were mistakenly given an appetizer which we had not ordered. Clearly, the serving system is incapable of handling a full restaurant. I also saw people being moved to different tables to make way for other, larger parties. I understand the business sense, but that's a completely classless move. Our server was very friendly, but rushed us out as soon as we were done eating. Bland food, poor service, long waits, and high prices? I'll pass.",

Theres a line of people waiting and no one to help anyone. Eight minutes goes by before a girl finally emerges from the back . She says no word of greeting to anyone. We finally sit and a waiter named Dylan comes to our table and says he'll be back \"in a minute\" to take our order. Fifteen minutes go by and he never returns to our table. I flag down the manager and he acts annoyed and asks me what I want. I tell him I'd like to order, and to take my families order first  and he starts laughing at me in a mocking tone and with a sarcastic inflection in his voice and says \"I thought you were ready to order\"!. I inform him I'm deferring to my family first to be polite and expect him to be respectful. Needless to say at this point my meal was ruined. The manager is a man in his mid forties dressed like a slob and very disrespectful. He also doesn't manage his staff, as reflected by the disappearing acts the hostess and waiter pulled in a nearly empty restaurant hanging out in the back instead of attending to their customers. and with the disrespectful attitude that manager imposed on me.They have the gall to call this a top level restaurant. You'd receive better service at a Dennys.",

We were pretty hungry and almost left, but the two hostesses working were just so sweet that we decided to wait it out anyways (which turned out to only be around 10 minutes). One of them even checked on us a couple of times and told us that there was only one person in front of us and we were next. Such a sweetheart. Our server was Claire and she was just as sweet! Usually when restaurants are busy, you can tell the servers are stressed out and they tend to kind of rush you to make a decision, but she was the exact opposite. We ended up deciding on the chicken lettuce wraps and split the Mongolian Beef. NOM! It was so good. I wish we had leftovers because I can't stop thinking about the deliciousness that was P. F. Changs! The manager, Mike, is a very very nice man, too which I think must rub off on all of his employees. Great food and amazing service. I have NOTHING to complain about!",

I expected it to be okay, but I ended up loving it, especially their Kung Pao beef! The texture of the food is absolutely amazing. The crispiness of their beef comes through the sauce they put on top of it. The crispiness goes really well with the crunchy carrots and peanuts in the dish. It's a little salty, but it goes great with their rice.  Another great dish is their Salt & Pepper Calamari. It is nothing like calamari you have had in the past. Other calamari I have had is greasy and oily but theirs is light and fluffy. The outside has a nice crunch while the calamari on the inside still has its original texture. The dipping sauces are great and provide a nice sour twang to the calamari.  The service is attentive but not annoying and the decorations are super cute. Overall, it is a great place to go for a fun night out!",

Let me explain how wonderful they were...we took our 87 year old grandmother out to eat.  She loves the egg-drop soup and lettuce wraps.  When she picks the lunch spot, PF Changs is her place of choice! As we walked to the door pushing the wheel-chair, Amy, who turned out to be our waitress, politely opened the door and helped us to our table.  She was patient with our order and pampered us the entire time.  Amy cheerfully completed all our requests and even went overboard.  The food was well prepared, great portion sizes and straight from the kitchen to our table in amazing time!  Yes we enjoyed grandma's favorites as well as a couple of ours!  When it was time to leave, as if Amy hadn't bee fantastic already, she boxed our leftovers and spoiled grandma with several extra fortune cookies, just to make sure she got a good fortune.  Then she suggested we use the side entrance from the patio, which gave us a straight shot to the handicap parking spots and kept grandma out of the sun.  We really enjoy the food from Changs, but Amy really made our visit!  Thanks Amy, for everything!",

My son LOVED the ginormous horse outside, BTW thx!  We get a table and order.  I can't recall what my wife ordered.  Some sort of garlic shrimp plate with snow peas... It was worth a nom. My dish, however was the full triple nom. Double Pan Fried Noodles. Freaking amazing.  It tasted like the Kung Pao Chicken had rolled around on a bed of noodles so FAST that it cooked them to a delightful crisp and then left its tasty juices behind on its bed. Nom Nom Nom.  We also order Crispy Green Beans for my son, but we ended up eating most of them ourselves. Sorry Conor :( but they were too good to pass up!!!! Tempura coated green beans lightly cooked and served with a spicy ranch style dipping sauce.  It was equally delish!  Not to mention our waiter was on key that night.  He stopped by a few times and filled our mango ice teas and even bagged us up some extra sauce for the beans. Score!

I can almost swear that the little things that have changed are starting to annoy me. The proportions must have shrunk 30% in size (check out their new serverware, they're not fully round anymore, they more assymetrial and odd-shaped, to give the guest a more \"full\" visual affect that they haven't cut down in portions). But they have. They have switched to the cheap, off-white, plastic chopsticks, (they used to be dark brown or black). I think they have decided to cut back on costs by doing these things..but then their prices are higher now? That doesn't make any sense. How is it $6 for 2 spring rolls?   Other than the price gouge and portion's continually shrinking, the taste of the food is amazing. Yes, it is not real Chinese food. Duh. I'm Chinese. lol. But it sure beats walking into a hole-in-the-wall chinese restraunt with bright florescent lighting, awful music, and pink table clothes. You know what I'm talkin' about. Authentic Chinese food cannot be beat. Hands down. But P.F. Chang takes the cake for interior design, not necessarily the food.",

We sat for 15 minutes without one waiter or waitress even passing by let alone getting a measley glass of water! I told the hostess that we'd like our server and she said ok. We waited another 5 minutes and still no one!  We decided a 20 minute wait for lunch in a half empty restaurant wasn't worth it.  The last time I will darken their door.  Wise up Chang's!

So we decided to go with it.  We waited then I asked a hostess and she said we would have 2 parties a head of us and that ended up being 5 a head of us when I raised the issue I got a rude response back from one of the hostesses saying we would be seated with in the allotted time. I did not appreciate how and what she said.  But finally we were seated and I already had a sour taste in my mouth about this experience. But that is when Mike stepped in to change it all around he was very nice explained what in his opinion was best on the menu based on what we were in the mood for and boy did he get the meals we wanted and our meals were delicious to say the least and not only that we got to try the sweet and sour soup and we had the sesame chicken and this slightly spivey fish. Suffice it to say that Mike changed our 1 star experience into a four star experience if the hostesses would have done their job it would have been a 5 star experience we are going back in spite of the hostesses and because of  Mike and the great meal. Thank you Mike for making out valentines eve night a memorable and tasty evening.",

    "text": "I have been a regular customer at P.F. Chang's for many years, often using them for business lunches and meals with the family.  A key feature for me has always been their excellent gluten free menu as I am gluten sensitive.  I was shocked this past week when I was there on a business meeting for lunch and was told that the fried rice at lunch is NOT gluten free. I asked lots of questions of the waitress since I had been told many times in the past that it was gluten free by previous wait staff.  The waitress informed me that 2-3 months ago they changed this in the kitchen and that I should not order the fried rice there again.  I was in shock and felt very disappointed since I had asked about this numerous times in the past and was assured that this was safe.  On the following weekend, I was nearby with my family and we stopped in to this same P.F. Chang's for dinner.  We were greeted by a waitress who was about to go off shift, but did agree to take our order since we had been waiting and our new waiter had not arrived yet.  Before ordering, she had placed the sauces and I had asked a question about whether the sauces were gluten free.  Typically they bring the gluten soy sauce out first and have to replace the sauces, mustard, chili sauce after a gluten free order is made.  She proceeded to explain to me that these were in red ramekins so I shouldn't worry; that they were gluten free.  I proceeded to explain to her very politely how I wanted to make sure since I was very surprised to learn earlier in the week about the fried rice not being gluten free.  What a mistake.  She proceeded to patronize me and explain how their fried rice is never gluten free and that I should have never ordered it.   Not even an apology for my previous experiences.  Rather a 15 minute lecture on how nothing has changed in the kitchen there and that I must be all wrong and the waitress could not have told me this earlier in the week.  When I explained to her that the crab fried rice is supposed to be gluten free and is fried and is on the gluten free menu, she again proceeded to talk down to me.  It made for miserable dinner experience, which was only slightly improved by her going off-shift.  While P.F. Chang's makes a solid effort to put out a gluten free menu, after my experience I have to say the wait staff are not properly educated on food allergies or how to talk to customers.  My advice to food allergy sufferers is to be very cautious on dining at this restaurant chain. I know I have misgivings about going back...",

THIS IS  THE WORST CHANG's  FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. We have gone to PF CHANGS since it began in Scottsdale. WAY TO GO  TO DESTROY BRAND LOYALTY!!!!",

Nicely lit - dim yet, easy on the eyes - brings comfort to a very loud place.  Not a romantic place.  More on a good place to eat out once in a while with a fun group of friends and family - and I now have my parents doing take out on occasion.  They are good to hook you in and make you want to go back.  They should think about opening up one in SOMA here in SF.  They would have my business.  Otherwise, trekking out to the one in Emeryville isn't so bad - but, it seems so far across the bay bridge... hehehe (san francisco joke).",

We had never eaten at any PF Changs before and my husband had been hearing a local radio DJ gushing about how great it is, so we gave it a shot.      We told our server, Sara, it was our first time in and she actually clapped her hands she was so excited. She told us they were going to buy us lettuce wraps as an app for being our first time in. When she brought back the drinks we expressed interest in the 4 course menu and she asked us to trust her and let her order it all for us. We did, and it was all great! Egg drop soup, dumplings, Mongolian beef, kung pao chicken, and the manager bought us an extra entree of orange shrimp.       The service was great, the food was tasty, both managers came by the table to chat for a minute and thank us for trying out the restaurant. We brought home enough food for dinner tomorrow too! We were impressed to say the least. We will definitely return the next time we are in the area.",

It is the sister company of PF Changs so alot of the dishes are the same, in fact, I think they taste better at Pei Wei. In addition, its way cheaper and you get alot more then what they give you at Changs, Although its walk up and order and get your own drinks, utensils, etc, they bring your food to you. There is no tip necessary which saves ya $. Its just better all the way around.  Now I am not completely knocking Changs. Their food is very good. I especially enjoy the lettuce wraps and crab wontons (which I can get at Pei Wei), the orange beef (Pei wei has it also!), the Changs spicy chicken (only at Changs), and their lo mein (Different here then at Pei Wei). However, I feel like I have to order all of these things when I come here just to get full!!! That in turn comes out to over 80.00! K to sum it up, this place is not bad, not good, simply ok in my opinion but I will probably never go here unless someone else insist on this and I cant talk them into Pei Wei. Haha",

My husband has PTSD and high anxiety (he's a combat veteran) and we asked to get seated in a booth in the way back corner so that his back could be against the wall. She said she wasn't able to do it because there was no server for that section. She assure us that the booth we would be sitting at would have nobody behind us. Not even 5 minutes later a group was sat behind us...... when we asked our server (who was amazing) she moved us to the booth we originally wanted... she then told the hostess what she was doing to which she replied \"sure\" and stormed away full of attitude. I dont know who she was or what her problem was but she needs to have a little more hospitality if she's going to be a hostess. Other than her everything about our dinner was amazing!",

The dining area is big but the tables feel super crammed together. I was literally rubbing backs with the lady sitting behind me. My friend who sat in front of me could literally taste the cologne the customer behind her was wearing. Tables are waaaay to close to each other, ugh.   Our waiter come out right away, introduced himself, and took our drink orders. We knew what we wanted, so we placed our entree orders right away.   We ordered:   Chang's spicy chicken noodle soup a side of asparagus  Glazed salmon Shrimp with lobster sauce  and white rice  As always the soup was delicious. It can be spicy for those who don't eat spicy food! The asparagus are to die for! They were crunchy and were seasoned just right! The salmon was a first for us on that night, and it was very good! We always order the shrimp with lobster sauce as it is one of our favorites!  The waiter was attentive and very friendly! We did order our food right when we got there, and for some reason it took forever. We literally waited close to an hour. Parties who had arrived after us were getting their food before we did. I had never waited that long for food at any P.F. Chang's. The server did come around and apologize for the wait..   Sign up for their rewards program! You get pretty cool perks!   Service was good and so was the food, even though it took ages for it to cone out.",

Because of my illness i also require a service dog.  Belle is a Italian Greyhound,  9 lbs.  Well trained, not a peep, and sits quietly beside me.  There have been many times when a server didnt even realize she was there. We have taken her to PF Changs many times.  Never been an issue.  We have had the same servers or host(s) before and they have all loved her. Well today we got a whole different experience. Our server was an older Asian woman who was rude from the second she came to us. She said nothing about Belle, and she knew she was there because i asked for water for her. When we had finished our soup we asked for a take out container.  Minutes later a man came to the table to dish the left over into a bowel. He then said we could not have Belle on seat beside me. I told him she was a service dog. He said he didnt care she had to be on the floor. So I scooped her up to my lap, to which he sad No she has to be on the floor. On that flithy floor?  I dont even put my purse down there, and you think I am going to put my precious little one down there?  Crums, used silverware,  plastic wrappers not to mention stinky muddy feet.  Would he like to sit there for about an hour?  How about feeding your kids there?  Needless to say i got her and we left husband at table to pay check, which we shouldnt have. Belle, my walker and heavy doors made leaving tricky. But i couldn't get out fast enough. That woman was the one that told him to come hassell me, i know this because she came up behind me and thanked him.  PF Chang's took great pleasure in making us feel unwelcome.  Mission accomplished, we will never ever return. I go through enough in life with my disability to deal with this rudeness.",

    "text": "Yet another occasion I wish I could do a half star!!  Haven't been here in a long time.  But we had a BOGO coupon, so here we are!  Now I remember why we haven't been here in a long time.  The entree is standalone. No soup, no egg rolls, nothing. Even the lunch menu, where most places have a \"lunch special\" that includes extras, includes nothing.  No egg rolls, no soup, nothing. For lunch you can buy those things as\"add-ons\". Seems cheap for a nice restaurant.  Anyway, we ordered the Chang's chicken and the Sichuan beef.  Portions are small. They should be 50% bigger for the prices charged. Especially when they say they serve \"family style\".  For \"family style\" in most Chinese joints you could have four or five (or more!) people digging into the plates.  But here with these portion sizes you probably couldn't get more than three people getting a portion from any one dish ordered.  C'mon, PF, you can do better than that!  Chang's chicken is really just sweet and sour without the chunks of vegetables and pineapple. Flavor was good, but not what we expected. They should just call it sweet and sour.  We had anticipated something a bit different with some heat to it (they have the chili pepper symbol next to it on the menu).  Sichuan beef had really good flavor.  Really good.  This one was as expected, and we were happy with the flavor, if not the quantity.  The rice tasted old.  Not sure how else to express that.  Being married to an Asian lady we have had a lot of rice over the years, and for lack of a better way to say it this rice (brown) didn't have the fresh nutty flavor one usually gets with brown rice.  Service was fine.  Nothing to knock my socks off, but it was adequate.  Perhaps a bit slow given that they weren't that busy.  Without the coupon this lunch would have run us $37 plus tip.  For TWO entrees.  And, as I've said, not even big entrees.  The flavors were good, but not really \"wow\", and at this price point one expects some \"wow\".  The value just is NOT there at this price.  The BOGO coupon brought it down to $18 plus tip.  For the quantity provided this should have been the price WITHOUT a coupon.  So while the flavors were generally good, the very poor value forces me to go with two stars.  I would do three if the value was there, but it just isn't.  And Yelp still hasn't introduced the half star, so there you go.",

I r commend of you order this, ask for extra sauce. I have had this dish before and sometimes it doesn't come out with so much sauce so I learned to ask extra....so good! My friend had the Pepper Steak and said it was also delicious. I have been to this location before and I am usually pretty satisfied but today's meal was especially tasty (maybe it was the extra yummy sauce!) Service was also good and they were pretty busy.

But now I have to start my search again.",

The hostess sat us immediately, which was nice because I thought we were going to have to wait since it was during the week and during lunch time.  We began with drinks & both chose non-alcoholic beverages. I ordered the strawberry & cucumber drink which was tasty! My mom opted for something more generic like her iced tea. We then ordered edamame, wontons as our appetizers. Our waitress Devn was very patient & super nice! She was really pleasant to talk too. She helped us with ideas as to what was good. My mom ordered a soup & I ordered the orange peel chicken. Both were very good. My mom also got the california roll which was just as good.  We were happy with our visit & to top it off we got a red fortune cookie because its Chinese New Year season! That was exciting!!!",

We started with the lettuce wraps,because that's what you do at PF Changs. Yeah, they were ok, a bit salty.  We got big plates of a bunch of different dishes. Nothing memorable.   My dad sat with his beer and ate nothing, which really cracked me up. He hates Chinese food and there is not any American alternative to choose from. Occasionally we would hear him grunt in displeasure at the whole experience.   Over-hyped, over-rated.   My mother's take: This place is great! We should come here for your birthday Nesto.   wow.",

    "text": "Sad and disgusted I will never come here again...  I went for the first time to Pf Changs last night with the suspicion that I shouldn't because I hardly ever eat at chains because they are generally overpriced, over-hyped and have poor quality of food while trying to pretend that it is so hip. Boy was I ever right and this just goes to tell you that you should always listen to that little voice in the back of your head instead of the louder one in your stomach. Instead of going to a noodle house where everything is made fresh my partner and I opted to come here because it was in the parking lot of the mall where we were and he was ravenous.   Decor is nice et cetera, et cetera, and I ordered a glass of Malbec and some spring rolls. When the rolls arrived, they looked like they came out of the freezer bag and the sauce tasted like it did too. Not only that, but they did not even taste as good as the freezer rolls do lol. Completely void of taste and the only highlight was the arrival of my slightly chilled Malbec.  I ordered the vegetable lo mein and my partner ordered the mongolian beef. His arrived looking fine, nothing extraordinary and mine arrived looking like someone had gone out and purchased one of those Yakisoba noodle packs and just plopped it into a white plate. It didn't come with any rice and the lame oil and pepper trio they tout wasn't very good. The broccoli was undercooked and it was completely void of flavor. I was so pissed off that for a small ass portion which sucks by the way, they charge you $9 which you could get somewhere else at a mom and pop operation for about a buck less and it tastes so much better.  Good service but that's not enough to save their lackluster food, maybe just this one in Chandler sucks. Either way, I don't really want to find out.",

    "text": "Background:  I have wanted to try this restaurant since they 1st opened, and the rumor of their prohibitivly expensive food is what kept me away for this long.  Since it was Father's Day, and one of my daughters wanted to help defray the unethically high cost, I agreed to finally try.  Service:  Friendly, warm, and usually nonexistent.  There were 4 times out of 10 table visits where the waitress was unexplainably missing for over 15 minutes.  It took us over 110 minutes to get out of this restaurant-- we just kept waiting for the server.  I can also say that whenever she did arrive, she had a plastered-on smile, a soothing voice, and pretended to be attentive to our every need.  It's tough have a good family experience with her kind of ungenuine performance.  Price:  Unnecessarily expensive, and horribly overpriced.  Food from Pei-Wei (at cheaper prices) is easily comparable to these dishes.  Most of the entrees were $15-25, so this can only be a family restaurant for special occasions.  They will easily miss the entire market of routine family meals, because of their ridiculously high prices.  Please stop creating restaurants with price lists like this.  Taste:  The food was wonderful, and exactly what I'd expected.  I also would expect a 10-out-of-10 taste of food for this kind of money.  The portions were enough for a 2nd meal later, so this part was A-OK.  In summary, we won't be back.  My 1st impression when we sat down was that it sounded as loud as a cafeteria.  The concrete floors must have echoed the sound of all the diners clinking their silverware and talking needlessly loud in the dining room.  We will archive this visit in the family history and refer to it as, \"...remember the time we went to P.F. Changs?\".  I've enjoyed Wolfgang Puck's shows, advice, and attitude, but the prices are too prohibitive for any type of return trip.  I'm kind of stunned that they would pin their future hopes of success on the hope that another 1st time visitor will keep this restaurant going.",

    "text": "Four stars for service, comfy chairs and classy surroundings. Two stars for the food.   Chinese food has always been about inexpensive tasty food with some different flavors. PF Chang's is the antithesis of this: moderately good food at an expensive price. It probably costs so much because of the huge horse statues out front--I mean, really?   We were with a group and joined them late, but waiters whisked over to the table, brought us menus and drinks, and got us some rice right away. They quickly took our order and rushed it to the kitchen. We were eating in maybe 20 minutes. Considering that it was a very crowded Saturday night, that was very impressive. The servers were helpful with suggestions and very friendly. The kitchen was fast.   What I liked about the food was they came up with a little unusual and creative ideas: my wife ordered a lamb dish and they put some cilantro in it; not a classic Chinese ingredient but a good use of local flavor. I also liked that the kitchen was able to substitute shrimp for pork in my dish, although not on the menu.   What I didn't like was that my Mu Shu vegetables seemed overcooked without that much flavor, and the pancakes started toughening up at the end. By comparison, an independent Chinese restaurant in Phoenix made this dish with fresh-tasting vegetables with more flavor, and the pancakes were so delicate they practically melted in your mouth.   This place is okay for a larger group, and in this area, but for value and food quality, I would go elsewhere.",

We arrived around 6:00 PM on Friday night, and the place was very crowded already - a large party of 35 was taking up much of the table space so nobody was going anywhere for a while.  Nevertheless, the greeting staff were all calm, polite and cheerful, and we put in our name, were told we'd wait about 35 minutes, and headed for the bar.  Our bartender was a hoot, and gave us terrific service while we stood behind other patrons at the bar.  When our table was called (35 minutes later, right on the button), we were seated and joined by our server Brianna.  Despite what clearly must have been a hectic evening for her, Brianna was calm, focused and made our experience terrific.  When our food arrived, she commented on how beautifully my Oolong-marinated sea bass had been cooked (and she was right).  She was just delightful.  A number of people checked in during our meal to make sure we were happy with everything, and the managing partner offered us his business card and suggested next time we could contact him directly and he might be able to seat us more quickly.  The only reason I can't give 5 stars is due to the noise level in the restaurant (which can't be helped given their layout).  The evening was great, the food was terrific, and Brianna was one of the best servers we've ever had.  We'll definitely be back.",

It is sad because it WAS a great place to eat. Now corporate cutbacks and shortcuts along with the  gradual substitution of cheaper sauces and meats have rendered this eatery a mere shadow of its former self.  We tolerated it for sometime but most recently it became intolerable. Coincidentally the boys upstairs have released a frozen for supermarket consumers version of the recipes. It is marketed under the P.F. Changs name.              Frozen food!..Yuck. I might as well stay in, save money and put in a Marie Calendars or P.F. Changs TV dinner.

I've ordered twice at this location now that I live in Chandler. We have our regular dishes we always order: chicken lettuce wraps, beef lo mein, shrimp lo mein & side of white rice. I worked all day yesterday (Easter) so decided to order my favorite Chinese takeout PF Changs since they were open and I didn't feel like cooking. I really wish I hadn't. Our lo mein was very overlooked and pretty much tasteless. I forced myself to eat my shrimp and veggies since I paid $30+ for this food, although my husband could barely get through a quarter of his beef lo mein. The best part of the meal was the plain white rice. My husband called to complain. We order the same thing all the time and never have we had mushy overlooked noodles. They manager could have cared less.  He asked if we wanted them to remake it but by that time we were home and grossed out. He says thanks for calling and hung up. Didn't even offer us a free meal next time to make up for it. We will not be back to this location EVER.",

    "text": "If there was an option for zero stars I would absolutely use it. My friend had two gift cards that she received a couple years ago and called to make sure that they were still valid. She was told that they never expire by a staff member and then was put on hold while the staff member got the manager on the phone. The manager said that the number on the gift cards would show if they were valid or not and if she brought them in the store he would look them up. She then told him that she had the gift cards and could give him the numbers over the phone. He then said that he did not have time to look the gift card numbers up. My friend, frustrated and astonished that a manager would treat her so horribly called back and asked for the corporate or district manager's phone number, which the manager Mike refused to provide. I still can't wrap my head around how the manager Mike treated a potential guest. Due to this I will never dine at any PF Changs again.",

I highly recommend the hot fish! And our server (forgive me for not remembering his name) was probably the service I have ever gotten! He was very quick and precise. He took care of us with our drinks and refilled when needed. Bagged our food for us and even kept up on clearing the table with our empty dishes. Again the best service I have got in a very long time! Thank you for a wonderful evening with my friends!",

This time around after eating burgers, ribs, cups and cups of beer at the Phoenix Open and Chick Fil A I was in the mood for something healthy. I had that ginger salmon cuz I wanted something healthy and I was craving fish, lobster or oysters settled on fish and I gotta tell you it was something special. I wasn't really all that hungry because of all the appitizers I was munching on but at the end of the meal the plate was empty.  Changs needs no introduction. They're good at what they do and everything else just kinda falls into place.",

If you have friend like to take them out for a good dinner? PFChang still best for Asian restaurant.  Some people go to PF Chang's order Thai food I don't understand that is a Chinese restaurant, why? After they order Thai Foot and complain it's so funny I don't get it. Beautiful design great restaurant. Goodness of Asia present by PF Chang's.",

    "text": "Ok so looks like their service is certainly getting from bad to worse.  I used to return for their yummy food but I'm probably going to stop. When I first wrote a review I was asked to follow the contact us link -until today I haven't heard back! So that speaks volumes about their service anyway - or they just don't care!  Went out for lunch with hubby and yet again ordered the fried rice and asked for a vegetarian one so replaced the protein by tofu. Upon realizing that I had not mentioned plain/fried tofu I rushed to the server and informed only to know that the order is probably ready. But wasn't he supposed to ask me in the first place?  Thankfully he honored my request but this time it came in with eggs! Of course, I had to return as I don't eat eggs. The third and final time the manager on floor came to give my food. Instead of accepting their fault I was asked to be specific that I want vegetarian and not mention veggie fried rice as veggie comes with an egg - really? I was made to feel like it was all of my fault and not the servers in anyway! Extremely rude. Somehow I managed to convey that it wasn't my first time and I have dined in multiple times before and this error hasn't occurred as such after the first visit. Not sure if that how they treat their clients overall.  As you see on the bill attached- the also added charges for tofu- like a replacement of protein that costs probably lesser than chicken or to accommodate vegetarians come for a fee! Extremely disappointed and this was my last visit here.",

I never ever had bad tasting food or bad experiences any time I went to the ones I frequented in California. Since moving here to AZ a few years ago, I have been to two restaurants and both have completely ruined it for me and I will not be going again.   My most recent experience was last week at this location.   A water was accidentally spilled, and instead of cleaning it up, staff just put up a caution sign block at the table while the water pooled underneath. No one brought back any new silverware or plates after taking the wet stuff away.  The egg flower soup was ordered and it had absolutely zero taste and was thicker than I am used to so I asked for a bowl of the hot & sour soup instead. It was super thick, absolutely no flavor and was just not at all good.  The chicken lettuce cups were the only good food that night. Although it is hard to roll up iceberg lettuce as opposed to butter lettuce which is the kind the restaurant used to use in its beginnings.  The surf/turf meal was awful. Most all if the juices were soaked up by the potatoes which got soggy.   Really disappointed.",

The pork dumpling wrappers here were good. Not perfect, but good. I also had the spicy chicken. The chicken tasted fresh and there was a light crispy batter on the outside. The batter was not the lightest I've had, but better than the heavier batters, by far. The rice was also pretty good too. The rice was tender and fluffy. Overall, the meal was good. I liked that the spicy chicken was slightly sweet but also slightly spicy. The restaurant seemed busy, but it was because there were a few groups waiting at the front who were waiting to be seated even though there were a lot of empty tables. They also were good at refilling my water.",

We had a super friendly and attentive server, Jason K.  He was able to describe all the items on the menu and lead me in the direction of the kimchi fries which were to die for!  They were thick, hot, crispy and covered with kimchi, chives, siracha and the most delicious melted cheese that wasn't greasy or fake tasting like nacho cheese.  The cheese was creamy and delicious.  I also suggest the margaritas on the rocks.  They taste fresh and have the perfect little kick in the butt u need after a long day at work.  I'm going to try and make it back here on the reg.",

I brought my mom here for lunch, and we ordered several items that fit my diet. I ordered Egg Drop Soup, and then we shared the chicken lettuce wraps (I skipped the sauce and crispy rice noodles that came with it.), a pot of green tea, the Asian pickles, and indo-chine cauliflower with cashews. All very healthy, and delicious. We couldn't finish them, so we took the leftovers to go. The only reason why I'm giving it one less star is we had to wait for the soup a strangely long time.

We always start with a cup of wonton soup (me) and a cup of egg drop soup (my husband) and I've always gotten the combination lo-mein since it comes with so much meat and my husband switches it up between the orange chicken, the sweet & sour chicken, and the crispy honey chicken. The lo-mein is so good that it prevents me from trying anything else even though I really want to try the lobster fried rice. We last ate here on Thursday and that was probably our most underwhelming experience, I ordered the kimchi fries during happy hour but was not charged the happy hour price, it was only a $2 so I didn't make a big deal about it, but I just felt as if our food was cooked in a rush and the flavors weren't as well developed as usual. I felt as if our server paid way more attention to the family next to us than she did to my husband and I which left a bad taste in my mouth. But our first time dining here we had a really sweet server, her name escapes me now, she's a little older, tall, and blond and she really made PF Chang's an enjoyable experience for us and she always takes the time to say hello to us when she sees us. So other than the last time, we always really enjoy ourselves at PF and I'm sure we'll be back soon. Make sure you sign up for their email club because they send out pretty good coupons every now and again.",

So glad we went. The hostess Kayla was very friendly and quickly showed us to our seats. We talked about our hair being similar for a quick sec which set the tone for our visit. Our waitress was Taylor and she was GREAT!!! She spoke with us , was super friendly. She went above and beyond even tho I'm a little picky. She explained different dishes to me and was not irritated with me which was a big help. I loved the fact that she engaged in small talk with us but it didn't feel routine it felt like she genuinely cared about our experience there. My hubby said this changed his perception of P.F. and We will definitely be back !!",

    "text": "If I could give this place negative stars, I would. My mother and I came to eat this evening (having not been in P.F. Chang's for over 4 years) and were excited to see we had beat the dinner crowd and the restaurant was half-empty. We requested a booth and were told there was none available (there were at least four unoccupied ones visible) because the staff in that section was new and couldn't handle a table outside of their section. We asked if an exception could be made since I have a four month-old and it's more comfortable for us to sit in a booth with him. The hostess went to \"ask a manager\" and we waited up front. While we were waiting, a small party walked in behind us, with no reservation, and they were taken directly to a large round booth by the other hostess that was still at the podium. We asked why they were taken to a booth right away, with no argument, when they came in after us and we were told it didn't matter and they decided it was okay we were sat in a round booth, anyways. My mom asked to speak to a manager at this point, since there was no real explanation and we were still being treated like we were being difficult. We were told he was on the phone and would be with us shortly. Meanwhile, the server came to our table and was very delightful, we ordered drinks and spotted the manager coming from the back. Instead of coming directly to our table, he went up to the hostess stand, took one of the hostesses aside and talked with her, gathered menus, sat other customers (bear in mind, the restaurant was not busy by any means) and then chatted casually with the hostesses. We asked our server if the manager was planning to come talk to us, as requested, and our server went over to get him. The manager, Michael Gaietto, saunters over to our table and asks what the problem is. I could be wrong, but he appeared very \"out of it\", was slurring his words, had a hard time focusing on us and was blinking rapidly. My mom explained what happened and he cut her off, multiple times, and just said that the staff was new and that was the issue. My mom tried to elaborate to say that the new staff didn't bother us, but the fact that we were told we couldn't have a booth to then have a party behind us be sat in a booth with no pushback made us feel like we were a problem. At this point, Michael became very belligerent, continued to interrupt my mom and rolled his eyes at her and asked, \"What do want me to do about it?\" No apology, no real explanation, just frustration that he had to continue talking to us. My mom asked for a corporate number and/or a number for the GM of this Chang's and he took out a wadded, raggedy stack of cards and handed her a business card for himself and told her that she can \"hold on to that\" and that he was the GM. We began to leave the establishment and he continued to harass us as we walked out. I have never been treated like this at a restaurant before, and, if anything, I hope P.F. Chang's investigates the manager's behavior, since I don't think it's very professional to have a possibly drunk or otherwise inebriated \"Restaurant Operating Partner\" at their Chandler location.",

What you think you can order is not within the scope within the very small print on the bottom of the \"coupon\".  The menu has become so limited and although the portions are big enough for us they have also diminished in size.  The servers blame the new owners and the managers make lame excuses and say their hands are tied.  There is no heart left at Chang's.  Apparently they don't GAF about the customers........... who are ultimately their paycheck.  So sad!  RIP Chang's.",

But I still feel pf Chang should select better person for their reputation.",

Not only did the restaurant itself blow me away, the worker did too. Super friendly staff and always on top of things. Always made sure I was content and had everything that I needed.     Now my favorite part of this whole experience, the food. It's a little bit on the pricier side, about 15 dollars on a main entree. But I promise you it is worth the money. I recommend getting the \"Changs spicy chicken\" if you want a little sweet and spicy kick or the \"orange peel chicken\" if you want something a little but more mild. Either way whatever you pick on this menu, you will leave with a full stomach and a smile on your face.    If you're out with the family or even on a nice date with your loved one and you're hungry this is the place to go. The interior of the place is very lavish. The staff is very cooperative, and the food is to die for. I am very weird and picky when it comes to Chinese food but this place did not disappoint. My experience here was a 10/10 and I will be coming here a lot more.",

    "text": "I visit this location only twice and the reason I give this place 2 stars is because the first time that I've been there was exactly very nice: great food, great service. Just like you would expect in a dissent restaurant. The second time was awful!!!! If it was my only time there I wouldn't even give this restaurant 1 star if I could. The waiter was seems like his having a really bad day or he just didn't like me and my friend for some reason. At first his recommendation for the food was pretty flat and he couldn't explain any dish that had \"traditional taste\"  in his opinion. Now yes I do get that sweet&sour or orange peel chicken is very popular in Chinese kitchen but it has nothing to do with his attitude that evening. He was rude, uninformative and always speak super fast and ran immediately off the table when he was done talking (and no the place wasn't packed at all). Me and my friend were complaining that the time we were waiting to get our entrees was too long and my friend mention that we are in a hurray. Then first we couldn't find our waiter for a while so we spoke with couple of different  waiters to check for the food. When our waiter came by with his \"cheerful\" mood he decided that we didn't informative him that we are in a hurry and we are not waiting long enough. By the time It came it was 40 min from the time we order. I think 40 min it's a lot of time to wait for a fish and chicken. Even with the starters the gap between the courses was just too long and if the kitchen is on pressure at least the person that serves the food should be nice!! I told one of the employee about my experience that evening and he said \"he will tell the manger\". also explained him that I go to restaurants 3 times a week and I've never had such a bad experience in my life. When I finally ended my visit before I got out I asked from the host for a pen so I could sign my visa because the waiter was \"too busy\" too remember to bring one.  I told her that I hope the other waiters are nicer but she couldn't care less. This is my very first time I didn't tip a waiter, if that's how I felt after this visit I feel that I need to share my experience.  The only thing I can do is saying that the \"traditional\" sweet & sour chicken was tasty. And I would have come back for some more if I'll get treated better.",

My favorite dishes are the vegetarian lettuce wraps and the spicy eggplant. My husband prefers the ma po tofu and the vegetable curry. We also like to get take out. Did you know that you can order those little mini deserts to go? Ya, I found that out a few weeks back and ordered four of them. They are pretty good.   Beware though, P.F. Chang's food is extremely high in sodium. So if you have high blood pressure or something, you should probably eat somewhere else. Otherwise you might die.

During our phone call he kept talking to guests and yelling \"Goodbye!!\"  while I'm telling him my order. After I told him my order he asked if I knew what location I was heading with an attitude. I told him I was aware of what location I was heading to. He then told me he just wants to make sure the cooks don't make the food for nothing and I actually show up. At this point I want to yell at him, but I'm positive he's just mad that he has to take a to-go order from someone half his age. Customer service makes a place of business amazing and this place failed miserably because Mike couldn't take a simple order and say thank you. I won't be returning here ever again :)",

The experience I had on 7/30/18 with myself and 5 others was pretty bad, but I'll start out with the good. Our waitress Devan was very attentive and friendly. The food came out quick and was good tasting. In the middle of our dinner a cockroach was crawling on and around our booth. Our server came and helped us out and she was very apologetic, and told us she would have her manager sent over to us. After 10 minutes the manager still hasn't been by and the server again apologized and sent her over. Once she got to us she was very short and rude. She told us that bugs often crawl through their walls such as cockroaches and scorpions even.. I don't know why you would openly admit that to your guest. She apologized and offered us a free dessert which we declined because at the point we had lost our appetite. Our server dropped off our checks and said the manager took %25 off each tab, and after doing the math realized it was barely even 10%, which is beside the point. The point is the manager was rude and extremely unhelpful. I work in a restaurant and know how things should be handled, and that's not it. I gave it two stars and for our incredible server. Hopefully they get the \"bug problem\" fixed.",

First off, if you come to this location during Fri/Sat night. Be prepared to wait. Like 1hr for a table for two kind of wait.   And while the food was good; it was not wait 1 hr for a table good.    They have plenty of waiting/seating outside (no way I'd wait during the inferno summer) but this night is was nice out with a breeze so we waited.  While waiting  BE WARNED!! They clearly have a Scorpion problem outside.  While waiting along the small wall in front we notice two dead Scorpions right there at out feet.  Hard to tell if they were dead from being stepped on or sprayed first. Either way not a good sign.  We move to another area just to be safe and what do you know.  Two more dead ones along the wall. So be careful/ mindful of your hands/feet and little ones.   Once inside our service was excellent. No issues there. Waiter was great, attentive, and friendly.   Ordered the orange peel chicken and the avocado lobster roll. They were ok and not bad but nothing great either. Could have had the same quality at Pei Wei. Don't think I'll go out of my way to come back.",

I asked the woman what type of veggies were in the rice and she responded it's 2 vegetables. I then asked her \"what kind of veggies\" she said she didn't know.

Not having time to dine-in, I opted for carry-out at this location closest to my gf's house.   Pro's:  -Courteous and efficient staff on the phone. They cut right to the chase, offered me the typical add-ons and gave me a time frame to arrive. -Delicious food! We ordered chicken lettuce wraps (never disappoints), cashew almond chicken (large chunks of chicken and tasty sauce), beef with broccoli (my personal fav).  Con's:  -Tardiness. I showed up on the later end of the arrival range and waited 10-15 more minutes. -Busy waiting area. The carry-out cashier is the bartender and there's not really a great place to sit or even stand if the bar is full. There is a small seating area but it's directly adjacent to diners, so rather awkward (\"hey, mind if I steal an eggroll since I'm practically at your table\") -The broccoli beef leaked all over the bottom of the bag. Unfortunate.  Bonus points: -I was offered water a number of times. Mostly because I was standing in the way of the kitchen, but it was still nice of them to ask. -Very nice staff who apologized for my wait.  Bottom line: Unless you absolutely need to do carry-out, this P.F. Chang's China Bistro is really set up to give you a wonderful in-house dining experience. Gift cards or not, take them up on that!",

To psych myself up, I got there early to catch the tail end of happy hour. I was decently impressed with the black tea gimlet. It was served in a coupe glass, and the St. Germain made it sweet and smooth.  I ordered the Buddah's Feast steamed because I didn't want to deal with the usual 5 pounds of water weight gain that comes from consuming quadruple the RDA of sodium in one meal.   When our food was brought out, there was lots of confusion. The two servers started auctioning off our food, yelling down the table. One of the meals was wrong, and three other entrees came in its place. My entree was no where to be seen. I'm surprised they dropped the ball so badly. I thought part of the reason you eat at a souless, corporate grubateria was to experience a well-oiled machine that is able to execute orders correctly and efficiently. Splitting the checks was also a bumpy, drawn out experience.  Hopefully, I won't have to come here again.",

    "text": "I always enjoy P.F. Changs when I visit. They offer a special for two people: a choice of soup for each person, one select appetizer, a choice of select entrees, and banana spring rolls for dessert. I always order the lettuce wraps to start... You honestly can't go wrong with these. They are so tasty and come with chicken and a sweet soy sauce and ice berg lettuce. I'm sure you could make this dish vegetarian friendly. We also enjoy the California rolls here (yes, they have sushi! Don't judge my Cali rolls). For my dinner entree, I generally order Chang's spicy chicken with brown rice. The chicken has a spicy and sweet sauce over the delicious fried pieces. The Lo mein with chicken is also amazing if you love noodle dishes! My mom describes it as buttery in consistency... Delicious with lots of veggies. But the real deal here at P.F. Changs is none other than what is offered for dessert... The banana spring rolls and coconut pineapple ice cream! Please save room for this. My mom and I had no shame after stuffing our faces... We needed this in our lives. The spring rolls are filled with banana and fried to the utmost perfection. The coconut pineapple ice cream has to be the most delicious ice cream I have ever had... Paired with the spring rolls, it is to die for. I highly recommend these. The ambiance here is rather intimate but casual and offers low lighting for a romantic night out with a lucky individual. Cocktails offered here are interesting but a bit too \"fluffy\" as my mom would say. I just order a glass of house Chardonnay and I'm peachy keen for the night. Enjoy!",

The tempura veggies and calamari were bland,  soggy and really greasy.  When people don't finish an appetizer and ask that it be removed,  a server should know it's bad.   I had the Ma Po Tofu,  bland with no sauce to speak of and also the asparagus side dish.   The asparagus was ok but was also extremely greasy.   Husband had the sichuan beef,  he picked out some of the meat and left the rest.   His dish had no real sauce either, just...you guessed it...greasy...makes for some dry rice.  We really should have sent back some of the food, but it was my birthday dinner and neither of us wanted to spoil it.   But who knew that the food would spoil it for us!?   I put my to go box directly in the garbage when we got home. There are many, many, much better authentic Asian places in Chandler, stay in your car and drive to one.",

In my most recent visit I ordered some steamed vegi dumplings and vegetable lo mein.   The dumplings were good and maybe even a newer item as I don't remember seeing them the last time.   The lo mein was kinda overly saucy and could use some more vegetables.   Honestly Pei Wei makes a much better fresher hotter lo mein dish.   That's why I go there even without a gift card.      Service was okay.    Felt a little rushed and the server was a bit forgetful.     Overall a good meal with no whopping complaints.",

If we had found glass this would be a very different review.  We are forgiving people, I make mistakes at work almost every day.   Needless to say,  she did not get our usual 18 or 20% tip.

My boyfriend and I were wanting to eat but it was a little later than usual dinner time so the normal list of authentic hole in the wall types were out. But we also wanted something semi healthy so fast food was out as well. When we arrived, we were sat in a corner table as requested.The atmosphere was what you'd expect from a chain trendy forward american asian fusion joint. However, the lighting was very bright I felt like we were on stage: And now presenting... Okay, the key lime pie martini was amazing! It was delicious but just know they can be dangerous because you cannot taste the alcohol.  We started off by sharing the egg drop soup and egg rolls. The soup was decent but was too dark and not as flavorful as I expected. The egg rolls were way too greasy and soft. We then moved onto our main course where he ordered the coconut curry vegetarian plate and I the oolong steeped bass with spinach. The vegetarian dish was overly sauced in our opinion. The bottom of the plate was all liquid about 1/2 deep...hmm. The vegetables were overcooked and the tofu was very soggy (also there was a ton of it). My fish was prepared nicely but the spinach was a bit salty just sitting in the sauce underneath the bass.  The service seemed to be easy going at first but it got a bit repeatative as the night went on. The server seemed like he wanted to be anywhere but there taking care of us as well as his other guests. The manager stopped by with a typical insincere \"How is everything\" which I actually found to be annoying. The music was a bit loud and overbearing at times when we were just trying to have some calm conversation. All in all, for the prices they charge, I expected more.  Overall: Food = 3, Service = 3.5, Atmosphere = 3, Value = 2.5",

I like the chocolate dome for dessert and it's gluten free. YUM  I am very disappointed in the price increases of late.

It's a good place to bring friends or family and share dishes, love the Mongolian beef and honey shrimp. Our waitress Allison was friendly and we were sat and served right away even though it was busy. One thumbs up!",

Got up and asked the hostess if she could have somebody come to our table she wandered off never even came back to our table sat there for five more minutes we got up and left. They weren't even busy there were at least 15 tables in there that were empty it was like we were in the no-fly zone. There was a man sitting next to us waiting for somebody to arrive when she came in the waitress went right up to the table brought them their drinks took their order and walked off again. If this restaurant could get a minus one star that's what I would give it.",

Ok, how is it my fault that you can't understand what I'm saying in a crowded ass restaurant. I was only in there to pick up my order, so in less than a few minutes of being there he managed to insult me and lose my interest of ever recommending P.F. Chang's to anyone ever",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I stopped into this PF Chang's on a Saturday evening after watching a movie at the nearby theater. We were told that it would be a 30 minute wait. We were given our buzzer to wait to be alerted. As we stood right at the door in clear view of the 2 hostess who at several moments during our wait had eyes contact with me. Being I was the only 6'2\" black guy there. A significant amount of time had passed. I proceeded to the front to ask about our seating which at the time I was informed we had been passed up. I asked why that is when we did not receive an alert nor spoken to directly as they watched us stand there for almost an hour. As I was upset for being passed over for whatever reason they seated us towards the kitchen area. Irritated by what had just happened we sat quietly waiting to be served. We sat for 20 minutes and had not even received a glass of water let alone any help what so ever. A family then had been seated in our same area. I told my girlfriend to wait before asking for a manager to see if this family would receive service before I jumped to conclusions, and of course they hadn't sat there for 2 minutes before being asked if they wanted water or anything. At this point I was really upset and found a busboy to get a manger for me. During the wait another minority couple sitting directly behind me overheard our conversation and proceeded to tell me the same thing was happening to them. Mike the manager came over and asked what was wrong and I had explained everything that had happened and and my worst fear had been proven after hearing the minority couple behind us. Mike said well they just made a mistake and passed over you. I asked oh again? Like at the front door?! As I expressed a feeling of being looked over because of race. Then he proceeded to use the \" there are all type of people who work here... Black people, Mexican, etc. We wouldn't do that. But yet he couldn't explain how or why what had happened happened and didn't really seem to care too much of why then saying well I don't know what you want me to do. The other minority couple had the same type of discussion as I had from what I could hear. Then then got up and left. He finally then brings us water it has now been about 30 minutes since we had been seated. Asked what we wanted to eat. We then decided We didn't want to stay there anymore because we did not feel comfortable. So we got up and left and will never return! I'd advice any minority patrons to not dine here. Sorry so long but this was really upsetting to me. Thx for reading!",
