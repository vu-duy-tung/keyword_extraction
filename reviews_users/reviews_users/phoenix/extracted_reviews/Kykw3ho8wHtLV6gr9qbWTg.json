Amazing for restaurant food and I don't ever eat at restaurants essentially.  Make sure to tell them no veggies, though, if you don't want any otherwise they put some on and it was like $10 extra.  Super expensive for veggies.  Other than that, the healthiest option you can find for a restaurant.  And by healthy, I mean organic and not GMO (genetically modified mutant franken-food), which basically almost no restaurant is.",

    "text": "If this decision was based upon the food alone I would easily give this place 4 stars, but the service staff was horrible.  When we walked in the door there was no real host and the lady that sat us clearly did not want to be there. She was abrupt when she sat us and did not make us feel welcome.  The waitress was prompt in taking our drink orders but we waited 20 minutes for our food order to be taken and that only happened when I told another server (not our own) that we were ready to order. Unfortunately, the person that took our order was not our waitress but the disgruntled employee that sat us when we came in to the restaurant.   Also, let me say that the poor service wasnt a product of a full restaurant or a staff that was spread thin. There were easily 4-5 wait staff and another 4-5 support staff in the restaurant.  Once our food arrived we were pleasantly surprised with the taste based upon the service that preceded it. I had the mushroom rotelli pasta with chicken added and it was very good. I heard nothing but good comment from the entire table on the food, but the extremely poor service is what gives this location terrible marks.   Hopefully, it was just a bad night for the staff because I would like to go back for the pasta but I havent decided if I will take that step and return.",

    "text": "I've frequented both this location on Cactus, as well as the on on Scottsdale and Frank Lloyd Wright (Bell) since they both opened. Truth be told,  I've always preferred the Scottsdale location, and while the menu is the same, I've noticed the Scottsdale location was faster and more consistent in their food.  I'll NEVER set foot in here (Cactus) again, and here's why:  October 22, 2014, I went here with my 7 year old and my Mom. We arrived at 12:40, and by 12:45 we ordered. We watched another table get their food (who arrived after us), and so I asked what was the delay. The waiter said he'd \"go and check on it\", and by 1:20 we still didn't have our food, or an explanation.  (Keep in mind, the lunch rush was pretty much over that day,  as I counted two tables on the patio, and perhaps two more inside with customers still eating.) So, here I am with a hungry 7 year old and mother who's diabetic, and NEVER expecting to be waiting over 45 minutes at this point for food.   Ok. Things happen. Orders sometimes aren't entered in, I GET that.  I assumed someone either forgot to put in our order, or someone forgot to cook it, so I asked for some bread.  An easy request for an italian restaurant (or any restaurant for that matter). The waiter disappeared, and 10 minutes later, still no bread. I asked where it could be, and he said they needed to BAKE some.  What was inexcusable was that he was completely indifferent, not interested in correcting the terrible service, and the manager who came over was equally inept and unapologetic. My kid is awesome and patient, and so is my Mom.  I worked in restaurants many years of my life, and so I think I'm more forgiving than most but this was it.  We got up, walked out, and went over to Oregeno's across the street and proceeded to get top-rated service and food from these guys.  The reason Yelp is fabulous is you can have a head's up on what to expect at businesses. Just know what to expect here.",

The slaw looked good, didn't taste bad but could definitely use some added flavor. I don't think I would order it again. Thai peanut dish was AWESOME. tons of flavor, a good portion so you will have leftovers. They just came out with a new menu in March so they don't have a printable take home one but I will definitely be going back.",

    "text": "Just got a comment from Rob W. who works for Picasso ' s I guess? I usually don't care enough to respond but for some reason his comments struck a cord for me.      Rob, \"explaining\" to any customer about an inconvenience regarding a poor experience is pointless and comes across as if you lack any compassion. Guest perception is reality in this business as I'm sure you know. I don't like to plug the fact that I am in the restaurant business because who cares, but I feel the need to share with you my side of things.      In regards to the fire hazards in your restaurant you should stand proud in your staff being diligent about compliance.  However,  let's not embelish, the main side of your patio was over crowded with a large party which was far more hazardous than the 8 foot wide space to walk past our table once we were seated at the converted 2 top. Also by no means we're we in any way compromising safety of our family or anyone else in the restaurant. Remember it's 74 degrees outside and 6 o'clock on a Friday in April in Scottsdale, if you have the space available accommodate your guests. Don't excuse your oversight with a fire regulation it comes across a bit insulting.     In regards to the crayon policy no big deal there , it was just wierd and awkward to be given crayons to my 3 year old daughter which is a nice touch but then have them taken away. Once again it was 74 degrees outside and the sun was setting I'm certain there wasn't going to be an issue with melting. It's not my place and I really don't care about the crayons but because we were put off by the situation maybe you could educate your staff on when it might be appropriate to offer crayons on the patio. Take into consideration of outdoor temperature and follow through with proper cleaning after the guests leave you might be able to avoid the melted crayon problems.  Really though I dont care about the crayons it was just an uncomfortable experience for us.      Lastly Rob, owning your mistakes and learning from them are some of the most valuable lessons we have in this business.  I urge you to avoid standing behind arbitrary rules and instead treat situations with a little more common sense. Take note that your restaurant's food that night was subpar (which we didnt even get all the food we ordered) and should be addressed. No one ever in that moment acted as if they cared, and we left hungry and terrribly unsatisfied.     Again I'm not sure why I'm going at lengths to share this with you. Maybe it's because I love hospitality. Anyway I'm done with picassos but I maybe i can leave you with sime advice. Allow the customer to be comfortable,  be hospitable and genuine,  serve good food that you have tasted and when you make a mistake own it. Empathy goes a long way in this business.  I hope this comment serves you well. Good luck...",

All of us left our food either after 2 bites or not even 1/2 the dish eaten - we just wanted to pay and leave to finally get the check but had to wait forever just for that too!  We will never be back as a microwave dinner is way better from Whole Foods.  I filled out a comment card and left it behind with the \"manager\" that had no interest, but we literally paid $100 for absolutely nothing . Our son wouldn't even eat his \"Caesar salad\" it was so bad. Go to Pizza Heaven, New Vegetarian Green or Coronado.  It's worth going rather than throwing your money away and going somewhere else because the food and service was so horrible.  Just pure honesty.....",

We often have the same bartenders and wait staff, and they are always pleasant and happy to be there.  Their menu has changed quite a bit over the years.  But we are always open to trying the new stuff as it pops up.  We haven't been let down yet.  Their lunch specials are great for a break in the weekend errand running.

    "text": "Ugh, I always feel terrible writing a bad review, but sometimes it can't be helped...  The upshot is that the food was bland and dry, and the prices for pizza were super steep.  The food did look nice. Our experience: terrible, expensive food.  I heard good things about this place years ago, so we decided to meet friends there.  We arrived for Happy Hour, so the appetizers were half price and drinks were $1 off.    My \"Bruschetta\" was a rather dry flatbread, with a bland crust (maybe not bad for gluten free?), and toppings that weren't evenly spread out, so you got clumps of a lot on some pieces and not much on others.    The Brie was nice - a large portion with roasted garlic, fruit and sub-par bread.  The real problem came with the pizzas, which were incredibly overpriced for the size, even if they had been tasty.  My husband's pizza (\"super healthy wheat crust\", dates, red pears) was the smallest medium I've seen, and my small was truly a one-person pizza (mushrooms and vine-ripened tomatoes). With two toppings each (and free arugula), we managed to pay nearly $40 for a small and medium create-your-own!    The worst part was that the pizzas tasted incredibly bland.  I frequently order very healthy food- that's no excuse for flavorless results.  The organic tomato sauce was wet (but otherwise tasteless), making for a soggy pizza.  The fresh mozzarella didn't have the wonderfull taste and consistency that the name implies.  Even my mushroom and tomato toppings lacked flavor - how is that even accomplished?   The place was ok-looking and had nice service (aside from the male host who used the ladies restroom and left it dirty).    Our friends seemed to like their Caprese salad, Mushroom cap and Squash Ravioli with Pesto, so maybe our mistake was ordering anything with a crust.  I won't be going back to find out!",

    "text": "I want to give this 4 stars and would have if I'd written this review last year. I've been eating at Picazzo's for many years, both this location and the other one in Scottsdale.  Things have changed a bit over the past year that have frustrated me and took my rating down a star.  Over the years it has evolved to be a sort of healthy food driven concept which I like. I like gluten free and other attempts to serve quality food. I don't like the sometimes small portions and extremely high prices.  I tend to always get the lunch special of a pizza slice and salad. Salad is always great - I get the Chopped Italian. The pizza on the other hand goes from good to bad, just depends. Sometimes the piece is an ok size, fluffy and crispy crust, good amount of pepperoni. Today I was there with a friend and the slice was teeny, tiny and so thin I thought is was a pizza from Sauce.  It was a joke for a slice.  The special includes a drink, but my salad is an upgrade so overall it is about $13.25.  My friend liked her meal, but it was $16.00 and a bit more than what she wanted to spend.   They have a loyalty program that gets you a $10.00 credit for every $125.00 you spend. It is at least something to reward you for going there.  I wish they'd give some bread out with the full size salads but was told because of the focus on health they don't do it.  Weird, I saw someone order cheesy bread as an appetizer today so how is that healthy?  They also recently changed the dressing to my go-to salad and I don't like the new one. They made the old one thicker in texture and it is now kind of gross. Hey - it is ain't broke don't fix it!  Bring back the old dressing for the chopped italian!  These are some of the reasons my rating is what it is and not higher.  Overall it is a good place to go, but the owners need to review the feedback and perhaps make some tweaks to make it a bit better.",

We were seated in their outside dinner area, which fit our group comfortably (25 people).  There were outdoor heaters and a  very attractive outdoor fire, which kept us warm on a cool Phoenix winter evening.  I agree with the other reviews, that the wait staff could use a little more service training.    Advice:  Smile and check on your guests more frequently.  Food:  The walnut, blue cheese salad was absolutely incredible.  Sliced of strawberries, tear drop tomatoes, walnuts, tangy with balsamic vinegar.  We ordered the Napolitan(super thin crust) Naples Margherita, olive oil, tomato, basil, and a healthy dose of garlic.  Delicious pizza, and thin crust, so the pizza was too filling.  Organic and gluten free pasta?  Sounded strange, but I tried the Shrimp scampi dish, which was made with organic quinoa and gluten free focacia.  The texture was slightly different from any high end Italian restaurant, but the taste of the pasta, sauce, and shrimp was exceptional.  I enjoyed every bit, and highly recommend this restaurant.",

For a dinning room with 7 occupied tables there were 3 waiters yet somehow the guests were still neglected? We ordered the medium ultimate pepperoni and my 3 year old consumed 4 of the 6 pieces as I was able to eat 2, the waiter (who never told us his name) came by and asked if he could box up the leftovers???? I ordered 2 glasses of the tempranillo and when the second glass was brought the table was not cleared of any finished dishes. As we always have enjoyed the food we will go back (or do take-out at least) but the service is definatley lacking.  Hopefully the Scottsale/PV location can up their hiring criteria ASAP and make the dine in experience more enjoyable.",

I can say without hesitation that this Picazzo's has, by far, the best, most varied (relatively speaking; it is a pizza place, after all) gluten-free menu of any place I've tried since being diagnosed nearly nine years ago. It's such a thrill to know that I can go there and get salad, pizza, garlic bread, flat bread, bruschetta, or a cocktail without worrying about whether or not I will be able to digest it. The classic margherita pizza is to die for (my favorite), the hummus platter is good, and the chicken wings surprisingly tasty. Is this a good place to bring kids? Not unless you're raising a miniature James Beard. Take the kiddies to Chuck E Cheese. This is a restaurant for adults. My complaints are really more quibbles than anything. It's expensive (an unfortunate reality for celiacs), the waitstaff at this location (I've eaten at four) just this side of charming, and their gluten-free pizza-by-the-slice selection is really lacking. That said, I highly, highly, highly recommend this place for people with celiac disease.",

Today I was exremely disappointed. We orderd wings which were cold on the inside and lukewarm on the outside. Good wings should be piping hot.  The cheese garlic bread was a soggy mess with no good flavor. A stronger cheese would help matters along with a crispier bread as opposed to the gooey hunk of goo that was served. The artichoke dip was ok although it was not hot all the way through. The accompanying flatbreads were dismal.  The Caesar salad was ok but very salty and the dressing was loaded with garlic.  Any of these items ordered I could easily make at home- and with better flavor. The soggy bread, salty salads  with cold wings were virtually inedible.  I had I ask the waiter for napkins and then later for utensils.",

Again, the salad was an italian chopped but loaded with cheese. The meal could have served two people - and it was a lunch portion!! (pasta/salad combo) So if you're looking for good portions and something to fill you up - you found your place.  This used to be Pasta Pomodoro before, and the place was beat. But they've actually done some nice work to it and it's a very pleasant dining room now. Major props for that.  I'd probably come back with a hungry, large group (kid friendly) if we wanted a casual meal. Otherwise, I'll pass and stick to more unique places.",

Last time we went to the PV location they had Dogfish Head 90 on tap, which is amazing.  Pretty rare to find that on tap anywhere.  Great lunch specials also, I think it's like $7.50 for a slice of pizza, salad and drink - not bad in Scottsdale.  They also do a good job of communicating via email when they have specials.  All the locations are really nicely decorated and very upscale feeling.  Highly recommend it!",

So we stood outside for the .... 40 min wait ... in 110 degrees.   When we finally got in, we were never brought water. I had to ask the bus boy who brought us our over-priced avocado toast after waiting for 30 mins for our likely autistic server to appear.   And the server......omg. I actually hope he's on the spectrum. Because I can't think of any other reason why every aspect of his serving skills would be so poor. Unfriendly? Check. Slow? Check. Completely incapable of reading his customers? Double check!   Start to finish the entire experience was nearly 2 hours. And what a long two hours it was. $18.50 for chipotle pasta made with brown rice that was literally mush. Avocado toast so dry and flavorless I warned the people next to me against ordering it. Maybe the hipster who powers your toaster oven with his 10-speed was a little too hopped up on beard oil and locally sourced kale chips to do his job properly either.   Whatever the reason, food and service was abysmal. Do I look like I want dessert Andrew? Read the table. I want to leave this place and ne'er return. Save your money and head to chipotle. Least there's room to wait and escape the heat.",

I felt bad for the table behind me, where the lady had ordered a salad, but received something entirely different. Then, when they went to check out, the server got their bill incorrect.  I felt even worse for the couple at the table across from us who, having specifically told the server about a coconut allergy (they ask when they take your order), were served something that was made with coconut oil. They had to jet quickly to get to his EpiPen (understandably), but weren't even comp'd for the meal. Not my first visit here, but it will be my last. They should take the \"allergy friendly\" advertisement off of the window of the establishment, if they can't train their staff properly. Our food was ok, but  all of the negative things going on around us affected my enjoyment. I just wanted to get out of there.  Update 6/28/18:  Hey Nancy, the lecture was unnecessary. My review was, and is, a serious warning to people with allergies to skip your restaurant, lest the same thing happen to them.  It's not personal.",

It's on the pricey side, so today we came and took advantage of the $10 lunch special. They were also giving away a free cheesecake for anyone that checks in on yelp, and to be honest that's why we came. I ordered a caesar salad and pepperoni pizza which I was happy with- but it is hard to mess those things up. The raspberry cheesecake was just meh. My only real complaint was the service. The waiter was nice enough, but two things were slight annoyances: 1. The server never checked back after the food was deliver to see if I was satisfied. 2. The dirty plates were left on my table until I was done with dessert. I used to work in the service industry so perhaps I take notice more than others, but this is serving 101. The table was so crowded I could not even find a place to put the check so I had to lean it up against a dirty plate. Will I return? Probably. But am I dying to come back, no. Maybe if they do another promo in the future.",

That's definitely not acceptable... Luckily there were 8 of us and I ordered a bottle of wine so we had a way to entertain ourselves for an hour.   Let's get to what I liked though. I ordered the pulled pork ragu with butternut squash ravioli... It was fantastic. Pasta was fresh and the ragu was light. I finished my whole plate.",

I would have been fine paying that had the ambiance been more upscale. The ambiance feels similar to a low to mid scale family restaurant. Additionally, our server was acceptable but for the price we were paying it would have been nice to have some higher quality service.   This place feels like any other family restaurant but the food is a much higher quality! The food is also overpriced. Go for the pizza (not for the ambiance)",

I've always been impressed by their food -- delicious and cooked to perfection.  With that said, the price is a little high for me, but I do understand why that is -- the quality of their ingredients is superb, and since they cater to the gluten-free community, I see why the markup is necessary.  Service is also great.  I've been half a dozen times, and I have no complaints.  The waiters and waitresses are friendly and understanding, no matter the location.

Practically the entire menu is gluten free, but even my gluten-eating friends/family love it here.  The food is delicious and made with wholesome ingredients.

Pasta had my eye on this night, with which there was an array of diverse options. All the pasta's we ordered were magnificent. I will definitely be back to try some of the other dishes.

    "text": "I gave the two stars for the food-it's pretty good for being gluten free.   HOWEVER, the service? Awful.  The hostess was nice, but that's about it. We aren't quite sure who our sever was...it started out with one obnoxious girl who barley paid attention to us when she took our drink order...she kept looking everywhere but at us, it was super awkward. To top that, I asked her a question and she was so busy not paying attention that I had to say \"excuse me\" twice to get her attention while she was standing at our table with her pen and notepad out!! Luckily my boyfriend and I can laugh about this stuff.  After she took our drink order, another waiter came about 20 minutes later to take our order.  We ordered chicken wings as an appetizer and a pizza to share. We waited and waited. And waited. Drank our drinks...waited. It took about 30 minutes for the chicken wings to come out, the pizza came out a minute after that.   So, we had each eaten about 2 wings and just as I took one slice of pizza off the platter, our waiter comes over and asks \"do you guys need a box for all that?\" It caught me off guard for a second...really? We just started eating. I sad no thanks and went on...10 minutes later \"can I clear your plates guys?\" about 5 minutes after that \"you all finished?\" He kept lurking around our table, I could see him continuously looking at us... I almost asked him if he could just let us eat our pizza in PEACE but I'm too nice for that.   Anyways, our bill came out to $40 (not including tip) and our original waitress brought it to us then took about 20 minutes to pick it up. Needless to say it was the slowest, most obnoxious dinners I have ever had and I will not be returning any time soon.",

It was one of the best dinning experience (portion, taste, healthiness, ambiance).  Second time? Well, the order was fast, the waitress was prompt and it didn't take more than 5 minutes to get our order in after we sat down. However, the kitchen was awfully behind. We sat near the kitchen and I saw dishes brought back to the kitchen, waiters/ waitress commending dishes to be done asap. It's not the waitress' fault, I understand. However, with a hungry 7-year old child, we waited, waited, and then waited more. She could have offered some bread or dinner rolls, knowing that the kitchen was having serious problems. Or, at least, she could have told us that the kitchen was having trouble and the service was SLOW. So we could decide if we wait or leave. In addition, her manner was impatient, unwilling, and unfriendly at the end.   The food was okay this time: portion was inconsistent, sauce was still very  good. Not going back until they solve the \"kitchen\" problem. Sigh.",

Well, maybe check to see if everyone has their food before doing a check in with the table. Needless to say, we were all done with our meals when the 4th one finally showed up.

We had the truffle-infused mac n cheese -- blah. Salad came so lightly dressed there was no sign of the dressing, so we chased down a server to ask for more, he actually went to check with the kitchen to ask if there was dressing on it, then reported that there was and left. Had to hunt down another staff member to request dressing on the side. We split the entree and when the server brought it he asked if we would like clean plates or if we could use our salad plates. Really? No sign of our server when we needed her -- but she was quick to clear the table before we were done eating. We sat outside and the traffic on Tatum was too loud to converse.  Not so good.",

But where I used to live I would get a much smaller margarita pizza with kale and sometimes I would get 3 pieces of kale and it would be $15. So at least  here I get tons of veggies.

    "text": "Went to lunch with friends. One ordered 2 slices of peperoni pizza ($3.75 per slice, a bit pricey for one item slices in my mind), the other ordered the lunch special plate ($9): 1 slice of pizza (she choose cheese) with a side salad (in this case the Asian salad minus nuts). None of this was appealing to me by price or appearance. I ordered the lunch pasta plate choosing spaghetti & chicken piccata with a side salad (Cesar salad) with the drink included. My plate set me back $10.50, which is more than most people who eat lunch out during the week try to spend. Not a fan of the one item topping pizza and not gullible enough to go for the spicy Italian sausage slice at $4.25 a slice! I figured I went with my best option.   Well as I said theirs did not look very appealing. The Asian salad dressing and few slivers of wantons was all that made this lettuce salad Asian. Usually that salad is a cabbage based salad. The pizza slices were not very large for the price by the way and are basically precooked and warmed over when ordered with whatever topping you select. NYPD does this a lot better and gives you more options to top your pizza off with and you can choose more than one.   The spaghetti was cooked perfectly and the chicken piccata was tender and flavorful but still not outstanding and for the price was a very, very, small serving. My salad was old - ends were turning brown and it was not very crisp and the dressing thick and not so good. The small piece of bread that they rave about as homemade was dry and served without butter. I mean it was really dry! Like maybe days old dry!   All this organic and gluten free food did not impress me. Glad I don't require a gluten free diet and have lived many years without organic indigents, because if this is a fine example of both I would quickly lose interest in food. Oh and that drink was also an organic juice based 10 oz soda that by itself sold for $2.50 when not a part of the lunch special.   The restaurant itself sits on the corner of an unassuming strip mall. It has a small crowed patio that was full except for the 2 tables in the direct sun without umbrellas. The interior appeared clean and had a casual slightly upscale appearance but also a bit crowed by the closeness of the tables. Therefore this would not be a good place for kids.  Also they don't appear to offer desserts! And our waitress lacked personality and appeared that she would prefer to be somewhere else.   So I give the place 2 stars which is generous with all things taken into account.",

The pizza is quite delicious with the organic ingredients as well as the gluten-free pizza crust.  The overall taste is clever; I mean that it is good, but for some reason my instincts do not realize it is pizza.  The concept is to far removed from the traditional pie (e.g. the toppings and combinations are unique).    I enjoyed the dining experience, but the atmosphere was somewhat drab and stuffy.  The service was mediocre.  I would round up to a four star from about a three and three quarters.",

They have eliminated several pizza crust types and now offer thin crust only. The roasted garlic topping was whole cloves in the past and is now minced, it also appeared as fresh garlic on the bill. The caramelized onions were barely cooked. The pizza was also doughy in the middle but burned on the edges. The waiter was very inattentive and didn't give us any updates while we waited 30 minutes for our pizza. He also had someone else bring us our check when we asked about the unexplained change in garlic. Won't be going back any time soon.",

The fiance and I love trying new places and although we didn't know prior to entering that all the food here is organic and fresh, we were glad to find that out! they have 1/2 off appetizers from 3-6pm so we ordered the meat balls and stuffed peppers. Both were okay. The peppers were difficult to eat because the skin was still rough. However, the drinks were so good--he had the antioxidant cocktail and I had the sangria. Even better were the salads! I had the italian chopped salad & substituted w/kale (no upcharge) and he had the kale chopped--both very different and very good! the salad was so flavorful and fresh. We took them home and had them later that night and they were still delicious. We'll probably make this a regular stop after our lessons!",

Hubs had the Thai spaghetti and meatballs and he is hard to impress but it must have been perfect because he LOVED it! My aunt had a gf pizza that I tried a bit of and was good and my uncle had something that I don't recall specifics of but he seemed to enjoy enough to not have leftovers.

I would also like to say that the Manager/Owner of the one in Sedona shouldn't be folding Pizza carry out boxes! He needs to be focused on the customers instead. Maybe have all the servers/employees fold 10 each before leaving their shift.   I'm giving this a 5 star as the food was really good. Maybe a little help in waiting on tables, but both places were busy. You might give it a try. We definitely will be going back.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying this restaurant has one of the best staffs in terms of quality service I have ever seen. My servers name was Mark and not only did he steer me in a good direction for food selection but he was also funny ,smart and genuine. I came here for a Saturday lunch with a friend  to try out because a friend told me they can cater to my dietary needs. Just starting on a diet recommended to me by my doctor I sat down in a bar table and was greeted promptly. After introduction and receiving my  delicious lemonade ,Mark looking at my face obviously saw the confusion of me trying to read the menu and make a decision. He asked what questions I had and how  he could be of help to me. I told him the diet I was on and he replied that he reads about nutrition outside of work and knows exactly what I could eat. Wow.. A server who genuinely cares about their job and what they are serving. He told me not to even stress about it and gave me a couple suggestions from which I made my picks. The food came out and Mark told me to enjoy and that he will be back in a minute to ensure I liked my entree.  It was delicious. When he returned to check on us he didn't even ask me he just said your welcome and proceeded to chat and joke around with us. I myself like when someone is confident in their ability to please a guest and his joking demeanor was even better. It made me feel welcome from the second we walked in the door. The rest of the staff a woman waitress and a male busboy were equally engaging their tables with conversation and it just felt like everyone who entered the restaurant were family to this group of wait staff. I myself have never seen a busboy talking to customers and making them feel welcome. It's refreshing to see young people who actually care. Thank you for the stellar experience and the good fresh food, I will return and also tell my friends.",

There are also alternative crusts available like the honey wheat or the gluten-free. This location is pretty small, but they do have a patio, that is currently inaccessible due to the remodel, but I did notice heaters outside so when it is available it will be nice to sit at since the weather is cooling down. The price can seem a little much, but they only use organic products so I think its a fair trade. There is a full bar and the restaurant and bathrooms have always been clean every time I come here. Staff has always been friendly and I've never encountered a problem with food or service here. In fact, if you want a quick, delicious lunch, this is the place to go! Oh and I happened to notice they have a chocolate chip cookie skillet (aka Pizookie aka Pizza Cookie), yep, sold!",

The pizza is not bad but you definitely have to be in the mood to try something new, especially if you are new to the \"foodie\" world like I am.   We started with the spinach/artichoke dip. Highly recommend it! It comes in an edible bread bowl with slices of pita, celery and carrots. The dip was good with all four options.   There were only two servers on at the time and the place was busy! We still never waited for a refill on drinks. We will be back.",

Having visited the restaurant at the Promenade off Frank Lloyd Wright and also the one in Sedona, I would say this was the \"middle\" experience.  Sedona was our best experience (could it have been all the hiking we did before going there?) and Frank Lloyd Wright was just average.  At this Picazzo's on Cactus we sat on the patio next to the fire.  Had great dolmas for an appetizer, FAB Thai peanut pasta (gluten free!) and sulfite free wine.  As someone with food sensitivities this was BY FAR the best I've felt after eating out at an Italian restaurant.  Definitely check out Picazzo's - they are willing to modify anything and will satisfy even the non-gluten free folks in your group.",

We ordered the Chipotle Chicken  with the garlic and butter bagel crust and I got a small single Caesar salad. We were very hungry and when my salad was served I was grateful. As far as Caesar salads go this one was just OK, The pizza was very good and the crust lived up to it's name nice as a must try. My only complaint is that a large would be compared to a medium at Pizza Hut or Domino's for $24 keep that in mind if you just want some pizza. But if you want organic toppings, whole wheat crust, or gluten free crust then this is your place.",

We have given up on many restaurants and have found that we end up being the best educators as to this underdiagnosed condition. That being said...It's nice to go somewhere where the whole menu is available to my Celiac son. On our visit, I had the shrimp scampi which was perfectly delicious although could have used more shrimp for my seafood loving self. Both of my kids had the kids spaghetti with no meatball and enjoyed it. All gluten-free, I might add. For kids, they have coloring sheets, crayons and kids meals. Really, what more can u ask for? BTW, their chocolate milk is really good, but big. Go there, if u dare. I recommend for GF or Celiacs. Haven't had any issues so far. Service was a little slow, but I could hear they were training new servers. Not a bad thing.",

    "text": "This 2-star is deserved. I have experienced better. I've experienced better Picazzoses for that matter.  There are a lot of enthusiastic reviews on here. Mostly because people who must eat gluten-free for health reasons have a severe lack of restaurant dining choices, and are very grateful for any that exist. On the other hand, I feel there is a need to evaluate a restaurant based on its food, service and ambiance, and not upon my elation merely at having a GF place to eat.  Last night was just nasty. This Picazzos location has screwed me twice now on their (un)happy hour: half-price appetizers and $1 off glasses of wine. This makes most apps $5 and most wine glasses in the $6-$9 range. Happy hour ends at 6pm.  The last time I went, we were seated at 5:50. The waiter showed up at 6:03, and told us that we couldn't have happy hour specials because WE were too late. I requested a manager and got that straightened out.   Last night we weren't given happy hour menus or even told about happy hour. I had to ask. My belief is that this location would rather not provide happy hour, but are forced to because they are a franchise.   This time we got there at 5:25 pm, early for dinner, few people in the place. We ordered apps and entrees and wine. The waiter brought out app plates (sans apps) about 10 mins later. And we waited, and waited for our food. Meanwhile, other parties entered the restaurant, were seated, ordered and received their food. Our waiter was nowhere to be found. The one time he walked by, I gestured for him, and he walked by, his eyes less than 4 ft from mine, without acknowledging me.  25 minutes after ordering, I tracked him down. His response? \"Your food will be right out.\" I elaborated, \"I'm concerned because it has been a long time already. Other tables arrived after us and are already eating.\" His response: \"Your food will be right out.\"  10 more minutes went by. No food. Waiter came by. I nearly yelled at him - \"Where's our food?\" He said, \"It will be right out.\" I said, \"No-I want an explanation and an apology why we don't have any food. Everybody in this restaurant is eating except us.\" The waiter contradicted me yet again, claiming everybody was eating salads and they're easier. What the hell was this guy's problem?   Our apps came out about 40 minutes after ordering. The weird thing is that they were both very overcooked - chicken wings were dried out, shriveled. The artichoke dip was congealed from heat, and everything was incredibly hot. I'm going to guess that a cook forgot our apps in an oven.  Two minutes after our apps came out, our entrees arrived. My friend's ravioli looked good and he said it tasted good. My lasagna bolognese was a travesty: Separated sauce all brothy and sloshing 'round the serving plate, overcooked/heated lasagna, dried out cheese, small portion (about a 3\" x 3\" square), weird chunks of ground turkey strewn about (but not mixed in with the sauce). Bland flavor, no meat, no tomatoes, no herbs, vague cheese, could not find any filling between the lasagna layers - it looked like stacked noodles.  There was a new type of bread on my plate. At one time this place served regular and GF bread. So I asked. \"Is this gluten-free bread? I don't recognize it.\" Response from the dreadlocked, nose-pierced waiter? An eyeroll. Why? I asked nicely and I am concerned. He then said after a beat, \"All the bread is GF here,\" with a tone of \"you should have known.\" But they changed the menu and no, nobody told me. And his snotty attitude made me concerned that maybe he didn't really know what he was talking about. Nothing like rudeness to cause your customers to lose faith in your restaurant.   This place isn't cheap. Especially their pizzas, which are in the $20-$25 range for a medium. Dinner for 2 was over $50 - 1 soft drink, 1 wine, 2 happy hour priced apps, 2 entrees. Rude waiters don't do it for me. You don't have to be my friend, but there was way too much dismissive behavior among the waitstaff here. People who must eat GF are going to ask questions about the food and they deserve polite responses. And everybody deserves better food and service than are available at this location. Get yourself to any of the other Picazzos locations or Buon Gusto in South Tempe.",

    "text": "WORST. SERVICE. EVER.    Today was my first visit to Picazzo's.  i was SO excited, because the restaurant offers a full gluten-free menu, including pizzas, pasta dishes, salads, and even appetizers -- almost all of which are either gluten-free or can be made gluten-free.  I don't get to to out to restaurants much and it is such a treat to find a place that has good food that I can eat.  I was SO excited to go here.  My husband, our young daughter, and I arrived about 11:30 on a Sunday for lunch.  There were 2-3 other tables full in the restaurant-- they were by no means busy.    Everything was fine until our server arrived -- and I use 'server' lightly, because there was nothing service-oriented about him.  I think his name was Andrew -- and only because at the end, while we were sitting waiting for him to notice that he still had customers and bring us the check and some boxes, a friendly female server came, brought us boxes, and said, \"I'll send Andrew over with the check.\"  He did not introduce himself.  He answered every question we asked about the menu with a single word that conveyed complete and utter boredom.  My daughter asked if he was \"mad at her\" (!!!!!!)  He was uninterested and so unfriendly that he was just flat-out rude.  He seriously did not smile one time.  They do not list the types of sodas on the menu, so we asked, \"what sodas do you have?\"  He looked at us for a few seconds, and then said with disdain, \"Coke.\"  That was it.  The ENTIRE MEAL proceeded like this.  It was laughably bad service -- were we on camera?  It also pretty much ruined what was otherwise a fine meal.    \"Andrew\" was so amazingly unfriendly and unhelpful that I sat for about 10 minutes debating asking for the manager and requesting another server -- because this was a somewhat special occasion for us and to have it ruined by a guy who obviously didn't respect us, the restaurant, or his own job was just wrong.  In the end, it was easier not to make a fuss -- but make no mistake, I have no desire to EVER go back to this restaurant again, largely because of him.  HE HAS NO BUSINESS WORKING WITH CUSTOMERS.    The woman who helped us at the end was very friendly, and I am going to try to make myself go back to Picazzo's and just make absolutely sure that I never deal with him again.  Because the food was great and frankly, I don't have a lot of gluten-free places to eat at.  We had the bruschetta appetizer -- gluten-free and delicious.  My husband had the chipotle chicken pasta, which he liked a lot (and he doesn't have to eat gluten-free).  My daughter had the mac & cheese, which was a gluten-free fusilli with alfredo sauce -- very tasty.  I'd order that with some chicken on it any day.  They should sell it on the adult menu.  I had a gluten-free pepperoni pizza (with the raised edge crust) that was delicious -- the best pizza I've had in the 10 months I've had to eat wheat-free.    The food is a little pricey -- but they are making gluten-free food, with non-GMO ingredients -- to me it's worth the extra cost.  I do wish they had a few 'classics' on the menu.  It's hard to get those comfort foods in a restaurant when you eat gluten-free -- a straight-up fetuccine alfredo, spaghetti and meatballs, etc.  A ravioli dish with just tomato sauce and mozzarella baked over it.  What I would do for a good plate of gluten-free ravioli with tomato sauce.  Anyway.    No one asked us if we wanted desert -- and I did.  But we didn't really have a server, so Picazzo's missed out on our money there. \"Andrew\" literally handed us our check, took our money, and handed it back to us without saying a word or making eye contact.  It was just insane.  I can't believe anyone watching him would think it was appropriate to have him working with guests.  The entire experience -- which was supposed to be a celebration of our daughter's completing 3rd grade and a special treat for me (getting to eat in a restaurant!!!) -- was uncomfortable, a negative experience, and such a huge let down.  What an unnecessary disappointment.",

The Husband and I usually have to order 2 separate pizzas, because I refuse to eat most gluten-free crusts... they are usually crumbly with little resemblance to a \"real\" crust.  But, at Picazzo's, we have found a happy compromise - a seriously delicious gluten-free option.  Wow!  We have tried the Meaty-Meaty (they aren't kidding - it is LOADED with all-natural, nitrate-free meats) and the Diavolo (heaven!!) pizzas.  The Italian Chopped Salad is delicious.  Keep in mind that the SMALL salad feeds 2 people easily... we watched a number of tables receive what looked like enough salad to feed a small country!  You'd probably need 8 people to finish the large salad, especially if you are also ordering a pizza.    Thanks for offering edible gluten-free items AND healthier meat options!",

We only came here because we won a $50 gift card, and I would never come back. The hostess was nice, but the service ended there. Our server was snippy, looked angry the whole time, screwed up our drinks twice, then snapped at us when we tried to correct her. Our pizza was only barely cut, we mostly had to rip it apart ourselves, and the busboy kept trying to take our plates before we were done and without asking.   The pizzas were vaguely interesting in theory, but not very good in practice. There were very few options in the way of regular pizza if you didn't want to try one of their many \"theme\" pizzas (bbq chicken pizza, pasta pizza, enchilada pizza, etc). We tried the Shrimp Scampi pizza, which was tough and undercooked, and the \"Meaty Meaty\" pizza, which was okay, but had about six pieces of meat on the entire large sized pizza.   Overall, it was a free meal, and we left full, but it was uncomfortable, and only moderately tasty. I would certainly not come here again and pay,  given their extraordinary prices (a large and small pizza, two sodas, and a garlic bread appetizer for $52???), mediocre pizza, and lousy service. Definitely skip this place.",

    "text": "Today was my first visit to Picazzo's. I was thrilled to see the menu was organic (and therefore non-GMO). I was also with a friend who was vegetarian and we have vegan friends. The menu clearly delineates vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free. They even make gluten-free pizzas in a dedicated oven so that it doesn't come in contact with other gluten-laden pizzas. While I don't have celiac, I know how debilitating it can be for some - even if food just comes in contact with another food containing gluten. We had the gnocchi (mine with Gorgonzola cream sauce) and it was delicious!  I'm so excited to have found this place!",

    "text": "It had been awhile since we had been here but we saw a groupon and decided it was time to get back in. The food was great, as always, but the menu has changed. The new menu offers new quinoa bowls that I would like to try, but didn't try this time. This time we enjoyed a create your own pizza and had vegan alfredo, light daiya cheese, beyond meat chicken, spinach and mushrooms as toppings. It was amazing! We also enjoyed the vegan curry broccoli crowns as an appetizer. The portion size on those seems to have gotten smaller and I'm pretty sure the price has gone up. I also think the price went up on our favorite salad, the Heart Healthy. We get this salad every time we come and with no meat and no cheese I really don't understand why they need to charge $15+ for it. We're disappointed the prices have gone up, but with a groupon it was worthwhile. The new menu is expanded with more vegan options for us, so that is definitely appealing as well. Our server was Brian W. and he was attentive, knowledgeable, and patient. Great service even though it was a busy Saturday night and we could tell the table next to us was a pain to deal with. We will go back, but will look for lunch specials, happy hour and groupons since they are getting a little too expensive for our pocketbooks.",

Now the bad news is that for 23 bucks for a large....it is not very large....but it is filling.....so if your looking for great tasting pizza....salad....pasta....and desert....and remember it's mostly organic.....then go to Picazzo's.

This place re-invented itself several years ago and now emphasizes their organic, gluten-free, etc. offerings. But, you don't have to be a 'health nut' or have health issues to enjoy this place. The atmosphere is nice, the staff friendly, and overall, the food is good and always very fresh. This visit we decided to create our own Neapolitan pizza - a fun way to try different ingredients together - like artichoke hearts and sausage. It was actually pretty good! Our waiter was a bit pushy at first as we took our time deciding on what wine to order, but once that was settled, he only checked in periodically to make sure everything was OK. Nice little place - we'll return.",

The host was able to seat us as soon as we entered the restaurant, which is always good when you're hungry. The server was very nice, and the food came out promptly.  The food was decent. I ordered a pizza with grilled onion, pork sausage, and basil. For 100% organic food, it was good! I enjoyed my pizza, but it wasn't anything I would rant and rave about. For dessert, we ordered the brownie, which was inedible. I NEVER send food back to the kitchen, but the server actually took it back and took it off the bill. That definitely scored them some points, because I didn't even have to ask to take it back.  Overall, I would go back to try some more organic food, but not for the brownie :)",

I had a Greek chicken salad that was nice and fresh and my son had the honey wheat cheese pizza kids meal.  I must confess that I ate a piece of his pizza and the crust was delicious!  My complaints  had nothing to do with the food or even the promptness with which it came out.  My waitress was not friendly.  I asked her for some napkins (with a toddler) and she obliged by giving me two tiny bar napkins.  I got the feeling that she didn't want to be bothered with us because it was just me and my toddler and we weren't going to be big ticket customers.   The other complaint was that there was no changing table in the restroom so it was a real challenge to deal with that.  It would have probably been a pretty good dining experience if you were someone eating without young children.",

If you want it to be tasty and your order right, don't order anything to go.  A pizza will literally take an hour or more.  AND when your food is burnt, hard and your order wasn't to expectations, there's no reaction except for, \"oh sorry.\"  When you keep bad wine for by the glass orders and you know it's bad, you should throw it out and open a new bottle, not this place, they serve it anyway.    Recommendation is stop trying to save costs and staffing and get the appropriate number of staff in there instead of staffing with two people to run the place and be more considerate, especially to those that come in 2-4 times a week!  Sorry, passing from now, moving on to where customer service is important and delivering what you ordered is as well.  Super disappointing.",

I've been to Picazzo's in Flagstaff and on Frank Lloyd Wright on multiple occasions and it's always been good. I expected the same from this location, but was disappointed.  My partner and I headed out for our typical Saturday lunch and headed towards PV Mall. We initially were going to go to Chipotle or Oregano's but at the last minute I suggested Picazzo's. We were both hungry and in addition to our lunches I ordered soup and he ordered salad expecting them to arrive before our main course. They didn't.   When the food finally arrived, it took quite a while, still no soup. Alas, the soup was the last thing to arrive and it was lukewarm. I prefer my food hot or at a minimum warm. When I got to my quinoa bowl overall the flavor was good, but it had cold spots throughout. And yes, it was designated as a hot dish.  My partner's salad and pasta dishes were, according to him, pretty bland. He's typically very easy going and it's unlike him to make negative comments about food. We'll find another place to go the next time.",

Update 11/26/18 Dear Nancy, I don't not appreciate you're reply back I'm simply trying to warn people to never go to this restaurant! And yes the coconut is in your vegan pizza... you guys use the brand \"dayia vegan cheese\" and if you were educated enough to read the ingredients you would know they use coconut oil to create the fake cheese.  You claim to be the owner of Picazzos restaurant but you're not even aware of the brand of cheese you use... maybe you should extend your knowledge on the type of food you're working with.",

    "text": "The Sprint store next door recommended we eat here as we were switching out our phones and Sprint needed us to kill about 1.5 hrs while they did their downloading/transferring process with the new iPhone 8's.  If you're wondering why there are no pictures it's because we were phone less during our meal.  We came to eat at about 4PM today and the place had only a handful of diners in the restaurant. We were seated right away in the main dining hall and was greeted by a very nice waitress. Not knowing what to order our waitress walked us through the entire menu from salads to pizza to dessert. I love dining in a place where the staff is actually very knowledgeable in what everything tastes like and knows what's good with what.  After 15 minutes we decided to start with the Crunchy Asian Salad and then split a small pizza. What was really cool was that our waitress suggested we split the pizza in 2. So we did just that. One side was the California and one side was the Vortex.  Let's start with the Crunchy Asian Salad, the lettuce was nicely and evenly coated with the yummy sesame ginger dressing, the chicken a decent portion and nice and tender and the crunchy stuff just perfectly spread throughout the salad like the way it should be. Everything about this salad screamed delicious by just looking at it. The best part was that it was more then enough for two people to share one order.  Then the best part came, the pizza that we split into different types...All in all it was a total of 6 pieces and believe it or not, I was kinda worried that one type of pizza would overwhelm the other side but this was not the case. It actually complimented the two different flavors.  My husband LOVED the Vortex and I loved the California pizza. I have eaten all over the world and never ever had avocado, gorgonzola and spinach and bacon on a slice. There's something sacred about eating a thin crust pizza that has salad ingredients as toppings. I don't know what it is about this combination but it was just perfect in every single way. From the crust to the way the cheese was perfectly melted to the freshness of the avocado, this pizza was so perfect I wanted to order one to go.  As far as the Vortex, my husband said his pizza was so good he didn't have any left to take home. Rarely do we ever eat all the slices. Most of the time we take home up to 4-5 slices but with the pizza here we inhaled them.  To date in AZ, this was the best pizza we've ever had...  Now the journey of our meal was not over yet because when I checked in with Yelp, I found out that the restaurant was offering a free tiramisu or NY style cheesecake.  Was I excited or what?  At this point, the slow eaters we are, we were heading into the 1.5 hours territory and the General Manager then took over our table as our waitress had to start serving the diners starting to pour into the restaurant.   Throwing caution to the wind and with the recommendation of the General Manager, we chose the...get this...the gluten free Tiramisu. One word = HEAVEN. What a way to end the meal. My hubby and I gobbled up this white luscious yummy dessert that literally was melting in our mouths. Afterwards we wished we had gotten two orders. Next time.  I am so happy we stumbled upon this place because coincidentally my two favorite pizza places in the United States are both called a version of Picasso (my favorite artist too). So now besides having to fly across the country to eat at Picasso's Jacksonville, I now have something closer to home.  From excellent service, to restaurant cleanliness to FABULOUS, TO DIE FOR food, this restaurant is 5 star all the way. Excited we know about this place now as we plan to be coming back here as there are so many other things we still need to try.",

Charging additional for basic additions to pizza is a bit outrageous. Who just gets mozzarella, sauce, crust?! Making me pay more  (and per size, to add insult to injury!) to add one meat and/or one veggie is ridiculous. I could understand if I wanted more than one topping, but at this rate you could pay over 20$ for a tiny little pizza!  As always the food is delcious, but the menu change really left a sour taste in our mouths and we almost left without ordering (adding to the charge by the item issue, they took our favourite pie of all time (the lamb & chevre) off the menu completely. Woe is us. Not sure we'll be back for a long while, to be honest.",

It was tasty, although some of the salad on the bottom was icy cold so I believe it wasn't freshly made but simply pulled from a frig and put on a plate. A bit disappointing; however, I liked that the salad wasn't drenched in dressing.  My husband ordered a plain Caesar salad and spaghetti.  He said his meal was pretty average.  Nothing outstanding.  Soon after leaving, though, my husband became very ill.  It could have been a flu bug.  It could have been the food.  Hard to say.  I'm pretty sure my husband won't be back.",

This place is great if you care about organic, gluten free, blah blah blah stuff.  I don't really care about that stuff but I guess it is a plus when I'm chowing down on a wedge the size of my head.  Also, the Mama's Meat-Za Balls are just 'eh.  The meat is nitrate free so maybe that's why I didn't like them so much cuz I love me some nitrates.

    "text": "This review is long overdue, and I'm almost ashamed I didn't get to it until now.  But I'm writing it right before we plan to go back, it was so memorable.  We visited the Cactus Rd location a couple of months ago and had a fantastic time!  Our server, Kale, was one of the best servers we've had at ANY restaurant.  And that's saying a lot - we're middle aged and we eat out a LOT.  So we've got a lot of experience and not always that easy to please.  But we were certainly pleased with Picazzo's, not just because of the remarkably great service from Kale (more on that later) but also because of the food quality, particularly for gluten-free.  I know, I know, when you eat gluten-free or gluten-friendly, you're always qualifying your opinion with \"this was really good for a gluten-free version of X.\"  But at Picazzo's the food really IS that good, and you don't need the qualifier.  My wife has the gluten allergy, I don't, and I had no complaints whatsoever.  I specifically remember the cheese focaccia was really good.  Didn't fall apart, didn't crumble, really tasted great.  And the turkey meatballs were also excellent.  We didn't even try the pizza, but it looked great.  I had the eggplant Parmesan and it was excellent.  I mean, there are a TON of gf options at this place, and everything we did have was great. Since we're planning another visit to Phoenix, no way we're missing Picazzo's again.  It was THAT good.  A significant part of our positive experience was the service delivered by Kale.  He has a great personality, very friendly and approachable.  He did all the mechanical things skillfully - acknowledged us quickly, got our drinks (and by the way he's a great bartender because I had one of the mixed drinks, the Prickly Pear Margarita), timed our meal perfectly by giving us enough time to enjoy the appetizers before ordering the main dish, checked on us to see how we were doing - but more than just the mechanics of serving, he brought an art to it.  I'm serious, there is just something about this guy, Kale, that brings serving to another level.  It was easy and pleasant to engage with him.  He had great menu knowledge, and made good recommendations.  He seemed to enjoy what he's doing, and it shows in the quality of service he delivers.  Picazzo's has a winning formula, that's all I know.  This is a restaurant where you can not only enjoy great food, excellent service, and even have lots of great gluten-free options.  How could you not like it?",

The toppings included,shredded green chile barbarcoa with a jalapeno Alfredo mozzarella, roasted red bell peppers, red onion, sweet organic corn , and fresh cilantro, drizzled with chipotle sauce and queso fresco. The crust was perfect. I want this again next time I'm there.  I almost forgot! If you check in on Yelp, you get a piece of tiramisu or cheese cake. I got the tiramisu, it was fantastic!",

    "text": "(Lyrics - Dean Martin - Volare)  Pi-cazzo's, oh oh Oh Meri, oh oh oh oh Let's eat way up in paradise valley away from the maddening crowds  We can sing in the flow of a guy that you should know of Where Yelpers enjoy peace of a pie Let us drink the libations and eat at Italian Kitchen Just like Brie that is baked, some meatballs together we'll try  Pi-cazzo's, oh oh Please oh Meri, oh oh oh oh No wonder Bo Bites sings Your food has given me wings  We came to Piccazzo's with Merichelle from SheForksPHX gang and were delighted with some small bites, drinks, and a main dish of our choosing!  I've been here long ago when they first came into the scene, but much has changed and so has this Yelper.  With Vegan and Gluten Free options; Picazzo's really works to cater to the new eating habits of today's society.  Moving on, I started with a beer since I just banged out a tense workout.  For starters they served Baked Brie, Avocado Toast, Meatballs, Artichoke Dip and Baked Cheese.  My favorite had to be the Baked Brie; roasted sliced garlic along with baked apples over melted cheese and a fig jam to top it off.  Second and a close second had to be the Avocado Toast; avocado atop foccocia bread drizzled with olive oil, lemon, arugula, and feta cheese.  The bread here, I must say was banging!  I love the texture!  Moreover, for my main entree I ordered the Moroccan Chicken; baked chicken breast atop cannellini beans, heirloom carrots, braised with a spicy Moroccan sauce and finished with a fig jam.  The chicken was tender to the bite while the carrots and beans helped supply the texture.  The sweet and spicy mix of the sauce was on point!  In the end, Picazzos was kicking ass all night with the food and service; while keeping its menu classic with a modern twist.  Our group was in delight and food heaven while enjoying some each other's company. - Enjoy!",

My problem is with the Thai Peanut Fusilloni. It's my favorite menu item but it is the most inconsistent dish. On a spicy scale of 1 to 10, it was a solid 1. Three of us had the dish and all three were the same. I'm eating leftover as I write and it is zero spicy. Other times I have to drink eight glasses of water because it is so spicy. I've had the dish many times. There's about 50% in the consistency between excellent and not. I don't like to send dishes back and sending three back was totally out of the question. We ate it and it was ok but ultimately disappointing. This is just constructive criticism for manager's or owners who read this. We like Picazzo's and we'll be back.",

    "text": "This was my first time here today as well as my boyfriend's. I thought this place was great! The idea of gluten free, vegan, non GMO and organic can scare some people or put them off, but honestly - Picazzo's does these options SO well. You wouldn't even know that these things are gluten free or vegan or whatever else. The prices are worth it, given that you get to customize your food to your options (allergies, organic, gluten free, vegan, non GMO, etc.) and that the food is fresh and good FOR you. I didn't leave here feeling sick or bloated or so full I wanted to nap and that tells you something. The service is great too! Our waiter (a young man, can't exactly remember his name) was wonderful; checked on us multiple times, answered all of our questions and was just friendly in general when making conversation with us. Delicious, good for you and stellar service. We are already planning our next outing here!",

The owner of this establishment works well with the GF community to ensure his staff is trained in cross contamination.  The other thing that's great about Picazzo's is that almost everything on the menu can be made gluten free.  I always get the Diavolo pizza gluten free, GF of course!  The pizza is covered with caramelized onions, red and yellow peppers.It also includes the most amazing andouille sausage and pepperoni.  I have never had a bad one!  Their appetizers are good as well.  I can get great salads, cheese bread and hummus with pita that I can actually eat!  Life is good!  They even have a selection of GF desserts.  What's not to love?  This location always has pretty good service and consistently good food.  It's so nice to go out and not have to worry or explain your dietary restrictions!",

    "text": "My sister and I took my mother to Picazzos since she is currently on a gluten-free diet. I have been there before 3 other times and the food is always really good and since they have a lot of gluten free options to choose from, it seemed the ideal choice. My sister and I ordered a pizza to share which we specified to have no onions (the sis is a picky eater) and my mom ordered a gluten-free pasta entree. We also ordered some spinach dip and foccacia for appetizers because we were starving. The appetizers took forever to arrive (Like literally other people got their orders, ate, chatted, and then paid and left before our apps came) and came literally two minutes before the food and the pizza came with onions. We let our server know and she offered my sister a small personal pizza instead. We finished our appetizers and by the time my sister's personal size pizza arrived, we were ready to get the bill and go. When it came time for the bill, our server had no idea how to deal with the cost of the pizza we did not like and had to walk away again to figure it out with the manager. She ended up taking off the cost of the small personal pizza, which was fine except the original pizza that was only missing 2 slices, was twice as much money. Overall, I gave this place 3 stars because my mom LOVED her pasta and dinner was really about her anyway. Normally, I am not a complainer about service or food, but with Picasso's prices, their customer service and overall efficiency should be much better.",

There are lunch specials as well, but we really like this place as a quick dinner spot. They have a power card, so every $100 spent, you get $10 off. This is nice and can add up quickly. For an Arizona chain, this place has some good gourmet pizza.",

Came with mixed greens, a small cucumber, some shredded carrots and every other \"add on\" was minuscule.  The dressing was supposed to be olive oil, garlic and lemon juice.  No lemon taste what so ever.  Just garlic.  Like \"burn your mouth\" garlic.  AND the mixed greens had several \"old and bad\" sections that I had to pull out.  Shouldn't the cook have done this before he served it if the greens weren't fresh?  Bottom line, expensive ($15 with tax and tip) and not huge portions of the organic veggies.  I could have bought a bag of organic greens at Trader Joes for 3 bucks and had the same thing!",

Our pesto chicken spinach artichoke pizza was awesome, and chemical free!  Woo hoo.  If only they delivered, we'd order from them once a week!  I used the delicious deliveries service, but you know that always ads an extra cost.  We will definitely be regulars anyway.

Wife got angry with me because my surprise was quite audible re the cup excuse.10-15 mins to locate and clean a cup but at that point I was just hoping to get the meal over with.   Maybe it's my own fault but the service kinda changed from dismissive to not quite hostile but with a degree of contempt usually found  on staff at  tow yards. If you have a gluten free family member it's really really hard to find places to go  but at near $80 bill for 3 GF pizzas, 1 app and no real drinks  it just doesn't have the service to cover  the cost for \"ok\" pizza.  Really not doing a food review because if you have any reason at all to eat real pizza you don't need to come here:)",

Just have a bottle of water and bleach mixture and spray it on the inside of the sink - there is no reason for mildew.  To top off our experience, out waitress was constantly MIA, and didn't bring us utensils.

    "text": "We stopped in for lunch the other day   Service was good in the beginning and then just went nonexistent   We had at least 4 different servers taking care of us, by taking care I mean filling our water cups every 5 minutes, even when our glasses were still full... As far as the location, this particular seems to have a ton of regulars, which is cool... But each and every server/bartender was carrying on loud conversations with their regulars to be heard by everyone in the restaurant...   We ordered the Duncan Farms Organic salad and it was a good size for two people but it was very bland... The greens were not my favorite and the dressing was just as plain...   Our pizza took about 20-30 minutes to arrive and once it did, it was a bit small...  We chose the Naples Margherita  The medium pizza was devoured in less than 7 minutes...  I did like the pizza as it had good flavor and tasted \"healthy\" and organic... I also didn't agree with the size/price for it though...  I was still hungry while we left the restaurant... I would like to give Picazzo's a nothing try in the future...",

    "text": "I wanted to love this place but I have to say I was not really a fan of the pizza, namely the crust.  The toppings and sauce were fabulous and fresh like you would expect from an 'organic' restaurant.  I had the half Meaty-Meaty and half Vortex.  The meats on the Meaty-Meaty were fabulous!  I swapped the Italian sausage for andouille sausage (spicy sausage), but I am sure both options are great.  The vegetables on the Vortex side were just sliced in long strips and not diced, which makes eating it without dropping pizza everywhere or having stuff hanging out of your mouth quite the task.  I had the regular crust and I know this place strives to be 'healthy' and 'organic', but their crust does just not compare to many other great pizza places.  I know many people rave about their gluten-free crust; maybe it is 'good for gluten-free', but their crust compared to outstanding pizza in general... it does not even come close!    My server was great and very educated on the menu and answered all my silly questions.  I do plan on coming back; Picazzo's is quaint with good service.    I definitely plan to come check out happy hour and try many other things that are not pizza on the menu!",

    "text": "For a place that has \"vegan\" on the cover of their menu, this place is doing it all wrong. First off, Picazzo's has changed. Their menu includes far fewer vegan items than it used to. Now, if you want something to be vegan, it has to be gluten free too. They changed their bread so that it is not vegan. Pretty bizarre for place claiming to be vegan friendly. Especially when bread is typically vegan. They were not willing to make cheese bread vegan, when they have vegan cheese and flatbread they could use. And all of their pasta has egg in it, which is just disgusting. It is so easy to make normal semolina wheat flour pasta. Why is the only vegan option the gluten free rice pasta? Gross. For a restaurant claiming to be sensitive to people's dietary needs, they have no grasp of how the world works. Vegans are largely not gluten free. They should not be lumped into the same category and left with dry cardboard pasta as their only option. I used to love this place. But now that they have nothing decent I can eat, I'm pretty close to done with them.  Other than that, the food is generally good. Service is mixed, depending on the night. I do enjoy the vegan options they have available, I am just severely disappointed by the changes that have been made and the backwards step this restaurant has taken in the vegan direction. If they didn't advertise themselves as vegan friendly, this would be a different story.  If management reads this, please consider offering a vegan pasta that is not gluten free. A linguine or spaghetti would be nice, as that's what most of the pasta dishes are designed to be, and they don't work well with penne. It is so easy to get vegan pasta. I don't understand the obsessesion with adding eggs to things.",

Their meatballs used to be our favorite and we would come just for them. The last 2 times we've gone, they were MUCH smaller and almost taste frozen. Im not sure why they changed it.....maybe cost? Second was their flatbread with dates, Fuji apple and Prosciutto. The flat bread was doubled up and not cooked evenly and the prosciutto was gummy and fatty, not crispy as usual. Hmmmmm I sure hope this place isn't going down hill. One of our favs!  Update- food seems to be back on the incline :) thanks for listening guys! Last few visits were great!",

Much of my kale was fuzzy, looked completely unwashed and was visibly rotting in my salad.  I dumped my salad out, because there were just too many pieces of kale that were clearly rotting and when I did, I saw multiple bugs crawling around the to-go box.  The salad was one day old (not even 24 hours).  This experience may have caused me to lose my appetite for Picazzo's entirely, but for sure, my family will not be returning to this particular location.  I have posted photos as well.",

    "text": "EXCELLENT restaurant & bar, 1st Class & Elegant yet relaxed environment. The Supervisor -- named Kale, very fitting for an organic & health focused cafe -- was also 1st Class, obviously highly competent & passionate about his work, with an impeccable first impression, which continued for the rest of my visit. ... The Italian White Bean & Kale soup was delicious, as was the Hummus Platter. Both with great focaccia bread. Nice draft beer selection, too. There are a KOT of items in the menu, with a wide variety of interesting options. ... They are very accommodating as to dietary restrictions as well. ... The decor is beautiful yet unpretentious, and inviting with warm colors and lots of windows. ... This and their other restaurants are the Original Creation of the equally impeccable owner, Rick F. I was a frequent customer of his in the original Picazzo's in Sedona, when I lived there over a decade ago. ... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",

    "text": "This is a GREAT pizza and food place!  But, more importantly to us, this is AN AWESOME GLUTEN FREE HAVEN!!!!  My son cannot eat gluten or dairy and this location was so incredibly wonderful to us!!!  I am Vegan and my preferences were still important to them.  My son, with his digestive and allergy concerns, felt like a king because he could have almost anything on the menu!  They are wonderful because anyone without concerns will love the menu and for those of us who work with allergies are treated wonderfully!  Food is awesome!",

We always eat in except for picking up gluten free pizza dough to go. If you are eating gluten free this is the best place for pizza I have found since they make the dough themselves. The texture is as close to regular pizza dough as possible.  The menu is full of options for parties who's tastes varies from gooey cheesy noshing to clean eating.  The Spicy Uncle Louie is delicious, for drinks their sangria is great and the cucumber bay breeze is so refreshing.  If you're looking for something new to try or are on the fence it's a must. If you want a go to spot with consistency in the food it's easy to become a regular here.",
