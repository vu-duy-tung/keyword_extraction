Meat lovers would get their money's worth there. The variety of fruits and desserts can easily satisfy anyone's sweet tooth (fair warning, Indian desserts are really really sugary). It's a great place to get a little \"kick\" in your taste buds.  During my last visit, I spotted Mango ice cream and Mango juice, which made me tremendously happy. That being said, I think the quality has gone down a bit. Namely the chicken/lamb curry dishes have more bones mixed in and less meat on the bone.  I am not a connoisseur of authentic Indian food. But the presence of lots of Indian families there offers a sign of assurance. I like this place and hope it can maintain its quality.",

The ambiance was decent and the place was clean.  The naan was fresh and delicious and I LOVED their saag paneer (if I remember correctly).  That was my favorite part of the meal. I had a bit of the tandoori chicken, also tasty. The only let down was the gajar ka halwa, it was more like carrot that had been stewed in milk, it was not halwa. The gulab jamuns were good though so I loaded up on those. The wait staff were fairly attentive and courteous. I really look forward to trying their South Indian food particularly their Malabar fish curry and rice. They do offer appams as well (which I really really want to try). Overall, good food, I would definitely come back!",

Most fry fish will fall apart without battering which is a rare innovation upon fryer.  The lamb briyani was tender and garnished with yogert, mint, and one other spice sauce.  The mango lassi was crisp instead of thick amd griddy.  In many ways, this restaurant never stopped to impress me since I was trained as a chef/restauranteur.  Slight problem with redemption of Entertainment offer.  The owner claimed he didn't sign the 25% contract with the publication so 5% discount were offered.  I didn't want to argue so I just paid was asked.  Will return soon.",

    "text": "I recently stopped in to Chutney's for the first time in a very long time. It's a little out of the way for me, and I like a few places closer to my house enough to not bother with the trip. However, after my last visit, that's definitely going to change!  I did their lunch buffet, and I was pleasantly surprised at how big it was. The had all the staples, a few types of Tikka Masala, Chicken Makhini, Tandoori Chicken, Korma, Briyani, etc., etc. Basically, all the types of things that scream 'mainstream' Indian food (Not that I'm any sort of expert though, haha.) and all in one buffet too, which was awesome. Normally you get one of two things off that list, and maybe seven or eight other options. However, that was definitely not the case here. I think this is one of the biggest Indian Buffets I've been too. So, even though it's a little more expensive than others in the valley, I think the variety is worth it, especially if you're bringing friends who are trying Indian food for the first time.  In addition to all the basics, they also had a wide selection of things I hadn't tried before, and they were all equally delicious. Their sides, and desserts were also quite good. Even little things like having a wide variety of fresh fruits tells me they don't cut corners, which is definitely something to appreciate. Also, the spice level was perfect for a buffet, everything had a kick, but a very 'approachable' kick. Things could have been spicier, but they were super tasty even where they were at. Some buffets go way too much in either direction, but Chutney's is definitely a happy medium.  Atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice. Everything is very clean, and feels new, even though I know they've been here awhile now. Service is also good. The owner is friendly, and you get a container of water to keep at your table, which is nice when you're eating spicy food.   All in all, completely superior experience. I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "Right when you walk into this restaurant, the first thing you will notice is the quality and cleanliness. I think they have the right mix of fanciness and comfort, which is a hard ratio to get right. There are booth style seats to enjoy your meal with a little more privacy around the perimeter of the restaurant; as well as open area seating with quaint dark wooden square tables. Either are very comfortable and go well with the decor. The lighting is a delicately dimmed down and wraps the restaurant into a relaxed, laid back aura; giving you a sense of suddenly arriving in a new unique environment.   There is an aromatic lunch buffet I helplessly fell into, and I was very pleased with the diversity of options-both for the staunch vegan and proud carnivore. The tandoori chicken was tender and pretty bright orange-reddish color. The rice was as exquisitely all-dente as Joe Pesci's grits in \"My Cousin Vinny\". Yep. That good. The place doesn't mind you going back for more either, which bodes well for the hungriest of us.  I'll end by touching on what is probably the most important thing next to food: SERVICE. Are you used  to enduring the trifling Circuit City-esque style customer service of those unfortunate poorly trained and brusque Foodservice laborers oozing apathy while ruining your experience as they bowl over you on their high speed highway to increase the proprietor's turnover percentage? It's something we have all unfortunately experienced-similar to that of terribly long winded run-on sentences. However, there is good news! You WILL NOT get that cold dish here. Service is a dish best served warm, and this place throws it over to you like Tom Brady in the pocket. For example, I was enjoying the spiciness of their food and happened to cough a little bit. Without even asking, one of the employees (Bob) waived someone down for me-almost as if it was an emergency-and had them bring me over a fresh glass of water right away. WOW right? It's nice to be treated like people care that you are there. Oh if it were always so nice....SIGH  Go eat here. NOW",

Not sure about their buffet  2. Anjani is definitely customer centric. All the indian restaurants need to take a leaf out of his book on how to treat customers. He didnt know that I was the guy who left a 1 star review, but in general he was courteous with all the guests including our table.  3. The paneer butter masala was a tad sweet, the other vegetable korma (in a spinach sauce) was rich with cashews mixed in.  4. The 4 star review is mostly for Anajani's customer service and a visible improvement in the quality of service.  If you can hold up to this level of service and up your ante in buffet, you will return to your glory.",

Sometimes we come for the weekend buffet, which has a huge variety, love the chai and all the chutneys.  Other times we come for dinner.  Usually we get the dosa since I can't eat naan.  The dosa is amazing.   We came down one night when they had live music and wow, the guy turned out to be a top notch jazz musician from Seattle.    Other reviewers have written about the slowness of the service, but I think that people should recognize that Chutney is not a place for speed dining.  This is a place where one comes to relax, enjoy a leisurely meal, soak up the ambiance.  It's a great place for a date, or enjoy a night out with friends.  It's good for conversation.",

Not sure what they were doing!!   * The food was ok, just ok with the portions way too small for what they charge for them.   * Don't bother trying the Malai Kofta.   * The paneer dish should come with fishing poles or scuba gear to fish out the paneer from it.  * The naan was thin, and dry.  * The meat-daal was ok.  * Finally, I had to wait a long time for the check to arrive and then it seems they forgot to run the card. After a reminder they apologized and quickly processed it. We were not there for speed date but didn't want to hang around looking at our dirty dishes after we were done with our meal.  To their credit, their presentation with the pots on the stands with the tea lights is nice. Though the pots were delivered first and then someone came running with the stands and tea lights. That was almost funny. Well, almost.  Not sure if I am going back and I don't recommend that you go there either.",

We ordered Chicken Tikka kabab (which came on a sizzler) and Chicken manchurian for starters, which were excellent. The best Chicken Manchurian I ever ate at an indian restaurant in US so far. We ordered Naan and vergeterian curries which were good again. The chicken biriyani in the menu says north indian style, however they serve the Hyderabadi DUM chicken biriyani which is again excellent and no complaints about food absolutely. A+ for the food and C- for the Service  However here are some Negatives: 1. The service was still let down as usual. There were plenty of servers this time, but no use. They do not address you frequently to your needs. You need to call them. When you call them, they do not come to you immediately, however give a smile and say they would return only to come back after 5-10 minutes when they could easily listen to our needs. 2. They did not care to see if the water glasses were empty, we had to tell them couple of times to get the water and finally a water jar was placed on the table with no manners to serve the water in the empty glasses which was at least worth our wait. There were hardly few customers that night with several girls to serve who only seem to be busy walking down the aisle to serve one customer and then go back to the kitchen without caring for anybody else on their way back. They do not even look towards anybody else. 3. The main course arrived with only 1 dinner plate when we were 3 of us. The girl said she would be back with plates but never came back and saw her serving food to some other tables. We then had to get hold of somebody else to get our plates since the food was getting cold. 4. The girl who was serving food never came back and asked for any desert or drinks until we called her again. She was in a bit of demand as she was not to be seen for a while.  5. My final comment is the price of Chicken Tikka kabab.. It was 13.95/plate, and we felt it was exorbitant, highest at any indian place in Arizona. The second highest i have seen is at 12.95 at couple of indian restaurants in scottsdale. The Tikka was good but not worth at that price. I had to order it since my son loves it and there was no option for me. The Tandoori Chicken entrees  are highly priced and really should be lowered in my opinion. The tandoori chicken for instance was 12.95 which is again exorbitant, since it is around 10-11 everywhere else.   I hope the owners(with their highly inexperienced staff)  and other customers will find this review useful for the dinner and service.",

But I myself has seen the owner who did a couple of violations right infront of me. He needs to improve. 3. The biryani taste is over powered by spices which needs to be toned down.

The review is missing - I am not sure how but I did get an e-mail  from the owner stating that they will take good care of me next time. They also wanted me to read all the good reviews which are posted.  If bad reviews are filtered  -then all reviews will be good. The owner  should work on improving the quality of your food not just filtering bad  reviews. I would like to  give details about my food I had on Diwali weekend.    Gobi Manchurian - I wanted it to be spicy - they added Sri-Racha sauce to  dish which overpowered  everything else. Mango Lassi - It was so thick we could not drink it with a straw. kids would not drink it . Kothu parotta - this was on the Diwali special menu - wanted it spicy - so they added green chillies which were  raw. every bite had raw fennel seeds.  I have  visited this restaurant in the past and food was much better. But I was disappointed this weekend.",

The waiters were extremely good and helpful. They are Americans but they seem to practice a lot on their vocabulary of Indian dishes. We had mainly South Indian food. Sambhaar was brilliant. The taste was like home made. Dosas were crispy and cooked to perfection. The owner also came and met us and was very social and humble. Last course was Desserts: just too awesome to be explained. I would say the best gajar Halwa, I ate in US so far. Gulab Jamuns were very soft and they just melted in mouth. Badam Halwa was like a rich royal food. I will definitely go next week to try their North Indian delicacies. An amazing and stomach stuffing experience!!",

Order the \"Lollipop Chicken\" when it is being served and keep going back for more as, compared to Pasand, you have many options for your entree.  The only set-back outside of the new bright and cheery interior is the wait-staff is fairly young and inexperienced.  Ordering a dry martini was a challenge and was sent back as I basically got  a glass of vermouth and vodka-- not shaken, not stirred.  Why have a bar if you don't know how to use it?  Best bet:  stick with the Flying Horse beer.  A delicious way to wash down the spicy European influenced cuisine.  The joy and happiness the owner brings to environment is a welcomed changed form that dreary, drab, processed Indian food serving Pasand was.  Night and day.  Once the staff is up to snuff, this will be a five start rating for sure!",

My fiance got the butter chicken and it was pretty close to the authentic Hyderabadi butter chicken I so missed. I got the mysore masala dosa which came with TWO chutneys and thick, flavorful sambhar that was almost as good as my Mom's sambhar. We shared a medu vada to start, and it was crisp and delicious as well. Since I was such a fan already, I decided to take some chicken manchuria and fried rice to go for the next day. I haven't eaten Indian chinese food since my trip to India the previous year, and I was so satisfied that I am willing to drive to Phoenix just for dinner sometime to appease my homesickness. The wait staff was friendly, and the decor very inviting. I will definitely return!",

    "text": "A quick clarification on the one star rating - this is based entirely on the abominable service, which ranks in my all-time Top 5 horrendous service list for insanely bad restaurant experiences.  The food was decent.  Not great, but certainly not awful, and completely serviceable for an Indian restaurant attempting to rock the greatest hits of various regional Indian cuisines and not focus on one specific region.  The chicken tikka, vindaloo, and palak paneer were all solid three star dishes.  Everything besides the food at this place is an absolute disaster.  Arriving at 7:00pm with a party of 6, we were ushered into what appeared to be a banquet room to the left of the front of the house next to, well, a group there for a banquet.  A server promptly arrived, took drink and food orders, graciously made some suggestions, then, well, nothing happened.  Drinks promptly arrived, and then we waited.  And continued to wait.  And watched longingly as the banquet next to us was served and other tables were seated and served in the main restaurant area as our server flitted about the place taking care of every table but ours.  Around 7:15, with no drink refills nor food in sight, I started to get extremely mad, and my brother, who was visiting from SF for the weekend, in an attempt to prevent a scene and a walkout, got up and had to walk around to find our waitress, who assured us food was on the way.  Finally, around 7:30, two dishes were brought out.  And then another wait for about 10 minutes ensued until the balance of everyone's dishes were delivered with the naan bread that was ordered.    At this point the meal was obviously ruined, but we made the best of it, and asked for the check around 8:00.  Of course it was another 10 minute wait for the check to be dealt with, and then when it arrived I received the pleasant surprise of an 18% gratuity added for a group of 6 or more.  I'm usually not opposed to mandatory gratuities for large groups at restaurants, but considering the negligent service and our obvious displeasure, a conscientious, or even present, restaurant manager would have done something.  However, we didn't even see the guy, though we were told that the checks took so long because the manager had to run our cards.  Good job by you on that one Chutney's manager.",

Also to mention , the food was fresh and nice in taste for a buffet quality. They can deserve a star extra for cleanliness and the interiors.

I've been searching for a good buffet nearby and so far this is the best.  The selection was of good quality and there were multiple items that were appetizing.  Sometimes buffets are too small and have not enough selection and this was not the case here.

Both were delicious, I loved the cashew sauce that came with the biriani, and would recommend the vindaloo to everyone.  To complete, we tried an Indian style ice cream that is made in house.  It was the best!  Denser and more intensely flavored than American ice cream.  We had the pistachio and mango-- make sure you try the mango!",

    "text": "I'm writing this review as someone who was in the US Navy, has been to India, and has had Indian buffet at a minimum of six restaurants in the last two years.  I like to check out new places and revisit old ones to update reviews.  The food here at Chutney's is good, but prices have gone up several dollars for the buffet while some Indian buffets around Tempe have not.  What I would like to see change:  Some other Indian Restaurants offer Sunday buffets with garlic naan, samosas, free drinks like Tea, soda and also sweet mango lassi included.    Here at Chutney's it's all extra, so the buffet and drinks along with tip can run well near or over $20, which is quite high.  They do have traditional hot Indian tea, which is great.  Since discovering some other Indian buffet places, I admit I'm not visiting here as much as I used to.  I do like Nandini and also Delhi Palace, and I do switch between them.  Chutney's is still good, worth checking out.    Nice Indian pop music, nice clean environment and great selection of items on the buffet including dessert.    I haven't ordered off the regular menu in quite some time as I'm only here for the buffet now.  Thanks.",

If you aren't sure what to get he will give you some great suggestions. The butter chicken is probably my favorite.",

    "text": "For me, Indian food must have the right level of spice and spiciness. That means they have to use a certain blend of really intense spices and also make me sweat. Of course, I told the chef to give me the hottest and darn right he did.  Taste I went here with about 8 of my crew. What was awesome is that we had an Indian guy order some awesome dishes we could try.  I apologize if I butcher the names of almost all of the Indian food but I need to tell you, I enjoy the heck out of Indian food.  Appetizer - The appetizer laid out this spiced flatbread and three different types of chutneys but the only distinct one was the red pieces that looked and tasted like candied onions. The other two sauces are typical indian fare. A sweet red sauce and a green, almost minty green sauce. The flat bread had cumin baked into it. It was a light appetizer.  Garlic Cauliflower- Ordered as an appetizer and it literally looks like Sweet and Sour Pork. I'd argue it tasted like it too. I didn't think it was worth $8.00 but it was pretty good. Decently spicy but I've had garlicier foods.   Pepper Lamb Rogenjosh - I asked for the hottest Masala they could give me and here I got a very spicy pepper lamb masala. In hindsight, I kind of regretted it because it was hard for me to distinguish the flavor of this one because there was so much heat. I guess I should have listed to the table: never ask an indian chef to make it the \"hottest you can make it\".  Chicken Marsala - Standard orange-sauced chicken Masala. If you haven't had it before, you can describe it as the most basic Indian dish you could get. I'd recommend this for beginners who have no idea about Indian food. In general, theirs did the job.  Vegetarian Dumpling Masala - This yellow sauced dish had pretty big dumplings in it. Upon further inspection, and taste, I noticed that it was potato-based. I only tried a little bit but it was pretty good for a vegetarian dish. It reminds me a lot of a very thick Chicken and Dumplings Soup but with much more curry in it.  Puri - We had two what looked like relishes on our table. They tasted very refreshing and because my food was way too spicy, we got this to cool our palates down.  Masala Dosa - The most impressive dish by far was the Dosa, a gigantic crepe filled with spiced potatoes. My Indian friend said that this crepe was made of rice flour and tasting it, you can tell it was a bit sour which means the dough has been fermented a bit. Either way, this crispy, delicious piece of work has this spicy potato filling in it that reminded me a lot of the vegetarian dumpling curry my friend had.   Naan bread - The naan bread was charred and delicious. We like to go all out and order a lot of Naan. We ordered regular naan, buttered naan, the garlic naan and the filled naan. I would say the best naan I had there was definitively the buttered naan.  Ambiance There's a weird Indian MTV station that played in the background. In general, the theme of the restaurant radiates with a glow of \"yellow warmth\" with specs of rosy red due to the color of the silverware. The rice and masala dishes come in these legitimate metal pots that may look deceptively small, but the content fills you up fast.  Service My friend told me that the manager said one of their servers was gone today so our food was slower than normal. Either way, they had great service or the waiters were very friendly. I had the spiciest masala and they kept giving me pitchers of water to drink.  Cost About $20 dollars a meal. Disclaimer is that we as a group ordered a lot of food. Main course is usually about $12-$15 dollars and the extra pieces of naan, appetizers, and relishes made the price rise a bit. Since we all ate each other's food, we decided to split the bill evenly.  Selection A traditional Indian food restaurant is like a traditional Chinese food restaurant. It needs a huge menu to feel legit. Chutney's has a lot of items and it is presented in a nice, Silk-Road-like feel.  Overall Chutney's is a great place for your Indian fix. I unfortunately can't tell you the best Indian restaurants in Phoenix mainly because I don't go out of my way to eat it as often as sushi, noodles, Chinese food and Korean food. I guess I'll have to go to more Indian restaurants. Do you have any Indian restaurants that are a must-go in the Phoenix area?",

The first impression as we walked in the door was very positive, decor and ambiance were a step up from the previous establishment that was in this location.  Service was also good - prompt and responsive, but that's where the positives end.   Food was where they fell short with most items we ordered lacking in flavor.  We ordered a tandoori chicken and saag paneer, both were OK at best, the garlic naan was pretty good but it's hard to go wrong with that.  Being a native Indian I have pretty high expectations for indian food so I can only give them 3 starts based on the food.  It's a new place so hopefully things will improve as they get established.  I might try it again for the lunch buffet in a few months.",

The only complaint was the ridiculous pricing for the tiny ration of food. This time around the service was extremely slow and lacking which doesn't make sense for a not busy Saturday dinner service at a restaurant. My husband had to get up to ask for a beer. He also then had to get up a second time to get a cold glass for the beer. It also took forever to get our appetizer. The appetizer came out just a handful of minutes before the meal.  Now the first time I ate here the aloo gobi was great. Portion was small, but it was a flavorful assortment of cauliflower and potato and tomato.  This second time around, the aloo gobi was watery, bland, and at the most there were two little bits of potato and hardly any cauliflower. The rest of the mixture was just straight up red onion. Not to forget, there was absolutely no spice. I ordered it medium and got ridiculous bland. I also don't think it helped that the food was served lukewarm.  Not sure the hubby and I will be back after the two extremely different experiences we had.",

When started everything is rosy and great attention to the detail and respect to the customers? As time goes on, they think they are pioneers of the business start showing attitude. We are there for the dinner, ordered Goat Biryani, the meat is not tender and my kid commented that meat is slippery and rubbery; she is only four year old. You need to have strong teeth to eat. The chicken curry is actually smelly and it has some raw chicken feel to it. If they choose to ignore the signs it's sure will go down and history will repeat.  I agree with other reviewer Rand H about Buffet comments. The chicken Biryani served in the buffet is pale not tasty at all. I completely agree about the styrofoam cups nothing upscale about it.  Nan placed at the buffet is not warm, and service is OK.  Unlike other Chutney restaurants in the country(been to one in portland) they don't offer any chutnies at the dinner table as a complimentary. I was excited to hear they are opening one in Tempe with the name chutney, but looks like it's an empty promise.",

However the butter chicken I ordered tasted like chunks of chicken in a lightly seasoned tomato soup.  It was good, but extremely bland.  Rice was cooked perfectly, and the naan seems to be hit or miss.  First time I ordered it was perfect, second time it was like heated matzah.  I feel its important to note I've ONLY ever ordered butter chicken with plain naan.  It's possible that butter chicken just isn't one of their good recipes.  However based on that I'd say that if you want to introduce someone to Indian cuisine this is a nice place with with an American-friendly palate.    If you're trying to find more of a \"home cooked\" style flavor, you may want to keep looking.",

The cooks are from Southern India - but have experience with a variety of regional dishes from all over India. Classic with contemporary creativity - great service, lovely space, very accommodating and heartfelt people, committed to success - try for yourself, in particular the weekend buffets!",

But given the sheer number of available dishes on the buffet requires me to give it 4. I am a bit of an Indian buffet aficionado, and this place offers literally double the next highest number of dishes Ive seen at an Indian buffet.  And the food is good, too! It really is very good quality...BUT, I have had a lot better too. I like that they place naan on the buffet. I like that everything was well stocked. I liked the variety of entrees and desserts. I also liked the chai offered on the line. Really, this place is a great place to bring someone who has never had indian before or someone who wants to try a wide variety of dishes.  The service lacked. About 3/4 of the way through the meal, my father and I noticed that literally every other table had been given dosai as part of their meal. We did not receive these, and were somewhat bummed. Also, water service was lacking. The have a pitcher on each of the tables which contains just enough water to fill exactly 4 glasses. We were out of water for quite a long time and it was difficult to flag down a server.  Finally, the price was just ok. I had come to this location many times when it was Pasand, and they have remodeled and revamped everything from the decor to the menu, but Im not quite convinced that the price is worth the quality. My father seemed to really enjoy this place though, and given its proximity to our home, Im sure he will be back many times. I will probably not be back unless invited by someone else, or Im specifically in need of an Indian restaurant within a 3 mile radius of this location.",

Our table wasn't clean and we wanted to move to a booth, but they didn't let us. We had to wait endlessly to place our order, for the food to arrive and for the staff to get our check.  And yes, the curries are served with a side of rice, they forgot the rice part too. I would be okay with all this if the place was overcrowded and there were too many orders, but in our case, the place was almost empty, there were 3 to 4 other groups but they were done eating and ready to leave.   The food was good. I specially liked the chicken tikka masala.  Malai kofta was good too. Their spice levels are from 1 - 10. Anything beyond 5 would be really spicy ( I can handle medium to spicy food, but not super spicy)",

Food has been been consistently very good on our visits with a great selection for vegetarians.  I'd say they are a little on the expensive side for the buffet - so marked them down for that  - otherwise a good choice.  Get's pretty busy after 12 - with a ton of Indian folks coming in for lunch, but they seem to be able to cope ok.  Have not had a chance to try the Dinner menu yet.  11/23/12 Update  Overall the lunch buffet food selection is great. Very tasty - good section of meat and vegetarian options. Probably one of the best Indian buffets around.  Best if you can get there at say 11:30 since buffet can get pretty busy at 12 - though they do seem to handle the people pretty efficiently. I guess it's a good sign that there are so many Indian folks going there for lunch.",

    "text": "Well, well...the standards for Indian cuisine in the Phoenix just continue to rise and rise. Just a few short days after discovering Matka, I tried Chutney's, which is located in the space formerly occupied by Pasand.   For those of you who have been to Pasand, just forget all about that. The new owner has gone all out on the new place. The furniture is all new, new bar, new kitchen, new buffet table. Everything is shiny and clean and just a little upscale-looking. But for the three or four people out there that actually read my reviews, you'll know that ambience and decor are at the bottom of my list when it comes to judging a restaurant--service, flavor and price are what is important. Fortunately, Chutney's has all three covered in abundance.   The owner is a great host. For the people who look a little lost, he quickly steps in, giving them a tour of the buffet, which has a very generous number of selections (I have not been here for dinner yet). Several times during our visit he stopped at our table to let us know of something new coming out of the kitchen, or to recommend some dish or drink. Our waiter was also very good, knowledgeable and attentive. Pretty good considering how new the place is.   The food was great. My wife and I are still debating which we liked better--Matka or Chutney's. I guess the only solution is to each Indian twice as often and go back and forth between the two. I mentioned the selection--very large with six chicken dishes alone, not to mention numerous veggie selections and lots of other stuff.   Price is about what you expect--$10.99 per person and $6.99 for kids. I'm not sure if price and selection varies on weekdays--we visited on a Sunday.   I live just down the street from this place. I intent to be a very regular customer.",

There were certain dishes that we couldnt find elsewhere, for example the kerala dish \"Avial\". The chutney was the best, no wonder the name.   Everything we ordered was hot and tasty. Didn't realize the waiting time because of the \"Papad\" and 3 different  chutneys that was served initially.   The menu has no many varieties and the best part is, they cover all the cuisines of India from the north all the way to the south.  The two owners were really nice and sweet to talk to us and gave personal attention. Great hospitality by the staff and very nice Classical music in the background.   All in all, a restaurant I would recommend to anyone looking for best Indian cuisine. All credits to the chef!",

    "text": "A modest little place worth checking out. Very clean, nice interior. It seems that Indian restaurants have either an over the top design with big floral drapes and bronze whatnots, or they'll be a bit on the trashy side. 80's, diner style tables and Bollywood TVs. Chutney's was right in the middle. Comfortable, inviting.  I love that they mark what is and isn't vegan which is something a lot of Indian restaurants don't do which can make ordering a pain in the butt. Especially if the servers don't have very good english.  I had the veg vindaloo which was very good. A bit more watery than the vindaloo I'm used to, but it's forgivable. I really like a thick gravy in all my curries, which this didn't really have. The spice level was perfect. Lots of crisp cauliflower and toothsome potatoes & chickpeas. This would easily be a 4 star if not for 2 things:  a.) Despite the dinning area being near abandoned, service was slow. I was in for perhaps 15 minutes before I got my drink order in. There's really no excuse for that. b.) They didn't bring me rice with my vindaloo. We ordered 3 curries and only two plates of rice came out.  So, there you have it. Perhaps I came in on a bad night, but I feel the wait staff could use some improvement. With that, I think it could be one of the best Indian joints in the valley. I'll be returning and will adjust my review accordingly.",

    "text": "For those of you who can't figure out why this location is familiar, this used to be Pasand's Indian Food. I had walked in and walked out because it did not look great on the inside- NOW- this place is Chutney's, new owner, amazing interior! They gutted the place and completely redesigned this restaurant. All new everything! My silverware was sparkling, love it!   -The staff was very attentive; promptly greeted and seated, we were able to get assistance from our waiter with what to order and his suggestions, our glasses never emptied, food came promptly and piping hot, and empty dishes were immediately taken away.   -At the end of our meal- the new owner stopped by our table to see how everything was. He was extremely nice and you could tell how much pride he takes in his restaurant; you can tell by the way it looks and is run.  -To top everything off- there is even a generous feedback area at the bottom of every receipt. My friend and I had left our comments about how great the service was and delicious the food is. We did ask that if possible, we would like to see them add mango chutney to the menu (it's one of our favorite Indian sides and is a personal staple with naan in my opinion). :-)  -To start off your meal you will get some crispy Indian bread (can't remember the name), and you get their homemade dipping sauces. Everything seemed to pack a punch and was delicious. There was a sweet & sour sauce, a savory mint sauce, a tomato based sauce, and a coconut sauce. They were all very good and went great with the house made naan ($2.00) we ordered which was OMG delicious! Fluffy and perfect!   -We ordered two different chicken dishes, one was Chicken Tikki Masala and the other came as a recommendation from our waiter, both were very good. Their heat scale is 1-10. We tried one at a 3 and one at a 4 and they were both very hot! The four was extremely spicy for us- not so much that we couldn't enjoy it, we both just prefer a more mild heat. Both dishes were very smooth and tasty, you could tell the quality of chicken was high too (plus it was all white meat).  We will absolutely go back. We have been waiting for a clean, delicious Indian restaurant- even though the entire set up isn't complete, you should head in and give it a shot, I don't think it will disappoint. I look forward to trying the lunch buffet. :-)",

The Buffet spread is one of the best in the valley,they have a huge spread.A lot of variety from biryani to kebabs ,chaats to south indian dishes like dosas,vadas etc.  The only thing i would say is that the desserts were not up to the mark, they had several types of halwas and ladoos very colorful and pleasing to the eyes but the taste was a let down.My suggestion would be to include desserts like rasgullas,gulab jamuns and jalebis which are popular favorites  Overall definitely worth a visit.They also keep having different events which are open to the public.

The food here is a refined indian cuisine that you will find in no other place. Not too spicy or mild. Perfect. The staff at work are respectful attentive and want to make your experience as pleasant as they can make it, and they do a good job of it. My recommendation is goat biryani and mango ice cream for desert its made in house with real mango. Indian mango. You have not tried mango until you had indian mango. And you'll love that ice cream. Don't want to make this review too long so just go there. Just go.",

They seated us pretty quickly even though they were super busy when we arrived. The owner came and suggested items to try and made us feel welcomed. Will definitely be back for more.",

We said sorry very and also offered to pay for the drinks. But a lady (at the counter, may be manager. not sure) made a big deal out of it knowing the fact that it was just an accident happened with 3.4 year old kid. Later they charged me for the drinks and paid for the same.  Guys it's not just about food but these guys should also know how to treat the customers however food is not out of the world but average.

    "text": "My husband and I recently moved to Arizona from Southern CA and have been been trying out new Indian restaurants religiously in an attempt to find one that matches the quality of food and service that we are used to from back home. This place knocked it out of the park!   Let me start by saying I read a lot of the other reviews people wrote about this place, and it seems like most of the \"issues\" are service-related. We went for lunch when they have the buffet open, so there was not a whole lot of service required, however the service that we did receive was fantastic. We are not hard to please, but I was extremely happy when the server brought over a pitcher of water and placed it on the table for us. I know for some that might seem like a negative, however, for me I prefer it that way. Indian food can be spicy, and my husband and I both drink a lot of water, so rather than have to moderate how much food we eat based on how low our water glasses are, or wait for the server to come and refill our glasses every 5 minutes, having the pitcher on the table was a huge positive to our experience.   The food itself was delicious and they had a really good variety of food- plenty of familiar items alongside items that were foreign to me that I got to try. Also, even though they didn't put them out on the buffet, the hostess informed us that the dosas are included in the buffet price which was a great addition to our experience!   Overall the experience was great and we will definitely be going back, likely once a week. For $11 each, it's a great deal and definitely worth trying if you haven't been. My only suggestion would be to go early- we went at about 11:45 and they had pretty much just opened, but by the time we were finishing up (about 12:15ish) the place was PACKED. There was a HUGE line at the buffet, so definitely go early or late, but I'd say avoid the standard 12-12:30 lunch time.",

Full version: we ordered through Yelp eat24 & after waiting for 50 min, we called and they said the driver just left and that he was coming straight to us. It takes no more than 3 min to get to our house from them. Ten min later our food STILL hadn't arrived so we just drove to the restaurant & the person we spoke to at the restaurant called the driver, driver said he'd be 2 minutes, so we went home and waited...for another 15 minutes. They called us just after they dropped the food off & said he'd been pulled over by the cops on his way to our house, that's why he was late. Well, we didn't see anyone pulled over when we drove to the restaurant so unless he took a really, really long & out-of-the-way route, that was a lie. Then we called the restaurant back to speak with a manager, we asked for them to refund the delivery fee & tip, they said the driver wasn't affiliated with their restaurant (funny, the guy at the restaurant said he loaned the driver his car). So we contacted Eat24 & Eat24 refunded the fee & tip immediately and told us that they did not have any Yelp Eat24-affiliated drivers that were responsible for that delivery and that in fact, they do not have any Eat24 drivers at all in our entire city. That, of course, means another lie from Chutney's. Things happen & delivery drivers can be late but lying is just flat out unacceptable.",

However, I have spent time in India and other parts of Asia where I have had quite a few Indian meals and this appears to be very similar and therefore I'm guessing fairly authentic.  The second clue is that there were a lot of Indian familes there.  It has a nice family feel about the place, draws larger groups of people, so all in all a pleasant experience.

I am leaving as a highly unsatisfied customer and would probably not come back to this place again.",

Vegetable Samosas for the table....Brock informed us they were out. WHAT?!    This should have been our sign to leave but we stayed. The service was AWFUL and never once did our server come to check on us. We saw him chatting it up in the corner with the bartenders...we waved down others and instead of helping us they told us they would go get our server.  The food was pretty good when we FINALLY got it. But the fact that they were out of my favorite food item and the awful service we will never return here and hope that people read this as a forwarning and not waste there money.",

We definitely were not disappointed! The food came out very quickly and it was absolutely delicious! I'm not one for spicy foods but what we ordered was just the right amount of spice and there was a ton of flavor! Would recommend to anyone!",

The restaurant itself is super nice and ridiculously modern and clean- I'd have to say that's the main reason why this place gets 2 stars an not 1.   The food though was just bad. I realized this isn't your typical Indian food spread- no chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, channa masala, etc. That's alright though- I was actually excited to try Indian food that was not what I was used to- - that's until I realized a lot of this wasn't even Indian- but kind of Chinese asian? And one I came to terms with that, I realized that the food just wasn't good at all. We got there when it opened expecting hot and delicious food but a lot of the fried stuff already tasted old and a lot of the food was incredibly dry. The deserts which looked delicious, were also just below average. For $15 a person, this is so not worth it. Little India is in the same intersection and I do not see any reason why I'd go to Chutney's over Little India.",

First of all I'm very delighted to see many items in all the section like chat station , starters, main course, and dessert station. The day when  we went we had only bhel in the chat station. Other than that in breakfast items we had dahi vada, Idli and chole bature. Idly I felt a routine item and didn't get time to taste it and dahi vada was so soft and tasty. And bature they placed the tawa on the flame so that we can have piping  hot  chole with  bature. It was amazing. But only thing is we were not even informed that we also can order dosa Sitting at the table We didnt knew about it. Coming to starters they need to still enhance the taste of tandoori chicken and chili chicken tastes good but they need to low the input of vinegar in it coz the chicken was took tender!! And main course was fabulous loved the butter chicken and Rajasthani mutton curry.allapy fish curry was worth trying. The way they placed  the biriyani in the hot cases is quite interesting thing in this restaurant . We can get a chance to eat soft and tasty  biriyani rather than hard ones. Finally gulab jamoon is the heart of this buffet. Amazing taste will definitely go back for gulab jamoon here!! Baklava is not the traditional one. Gazar halwa is ok. Overall it's a good experience and the service is ok but still need to be improved.!!:)",

They had mutton instead of lamb. The rice was cold and not replenished. The chili chicken was overcooked and the Naan was cold and not fresh. To top it all off we were pissed when we saw or bill of 15 dollars each for a lunch buffet. We should have went to our usual place which is India oven in Mesa.  The service and food there is amazing and they bring fresh Naan to your table. I'm never eating at chutneys again.",

I have visited 4 or 5 times and have been impressed by the seemingly genuine kindness of the staff and by the deliciousness of the food.  Today we were treated well, we enjoyed the food and paid our check and included a generous tip, despite the fact that lunch was a buffet, so we served ourselves, apart from drinks.  We were  chatting and preparing to leave when a member of the staff breezed by our table and said that he needed to clean this table because other customers were waiting.  We jumped up in shock and headed for the door.   There were zero people waiting to be seated. None. Again, this perplexes me. We didn't eat too much food. We weren't noisy or obnoxious. We were well dressed. Others in the restaurant had been there longer than we had.   A puzzle.  I imagine my family members, who live nearby, will continue to dine here.   I might too, but that odd request that we leave has undone all of the gracious service we received in the past.  Odd indeed.",

Well he handed me a plate and then guided me through the buffet line telling me about each dish scooping samples for me to try. It was flavorful, tender and absolutely amazing. He explained the chef was a 5 star chef from India and his food absolutely was like no other food I have ever tried. I promised that I would come back with my family and have shared this story with all of my friends. One of them is on their way there now!  Every dish I tried was incredible!",

I saw that and I ended up not drinking it and left it there.  Unless they change there business practice I will never go back there again.",

    "text": "Take-out orders always have errors, but take-out is the only way to order off the menu here. Picking up a take-out order is interesting. The last time I ordered through GrubHub my order wasn't ready yet, so they directed me to sit at a table, then kicked me out of the table, then directed me to the bar, then kicked me out of the bar. Finally I was like, \"I'm just going to go sit over by the door and you can bring it to me when it's ready.\" 20 minutes later (seriously??) they asked me to come back to the bar, so I walked back through the entire restaurant AGAIN only to be handed the bag. Poor customer service. Pick-up customers really shouldn't be traipsing through the restaurant half a dozen times. They need a better system.   Their menu is FANTASTIC and I really like their food (except their samosas, which were SUPER salty the last several times I ordered them), but they push their buffet so hard it's nearly impossible to find a time when they'll let you order off the menu. Their buffet has a limited selection of vegetarian items, and the last time I ate off the buffet, I ended up eating mostly bread and fried cauliflower. They are also very slow in restocking, so if the one thing I can eat runs out, it's a looooong time before more arrives.  The first time I ran into the \"Oh, no, order the buffet\" pushback from the manager, I told him I was a vegetarian and wanted to order veggie pakoras and samosas off the menu. He refused, and assured me there were several pakora and samosa choices on the buffet. There weren't. None of my favorites are ever available on the buffet, and since I'm apparently not allowed to order off the menu anymore, there's simply no point in ever going back. If they want to be a buffet restaurant, they really should just ditch their menu instead of teasing us with it.",

The lunch started with the chat items as starters- Aloo tikki, chole, bhel and vada pav- all very nice. Tha main course has Sambhar, Rassam, Mysore vada, onion bhajia, rice, biryani, aloo mutter, palak paneer for the vegetarians. Didnt hv a look at the non veg menu.  While that looks like a lot of dishes, they all somehow didnt go well with one another.   While the taste itself was authentic enough, Ive had better Indian food in tempe. The taste wasnt exactly memorable enough for me to recommend this place wholeheartedly. The gulab jamun and fruit salad made for nice end though.  The decor of this place is classy and very contemporarily indian, so thumbs up for that. Between the 8 of us, the bill came to $132, which included an 18% 'Large Party' charge, which is charged to groups of more than 6 people (absurd american custom).  Thats definitely on the pricey side.   In short, if u wanna have decent indian food in a classy ambiance, worth a visit. But keep the expectations low",

The flavors in the Samosas were nice, as was the Palak Paneer...but again, it wasn't anything I couldn't get at the Supermarket from a box.  In addition, most places include naan with your meal... but at Chutney's, they charge 2.50 for two pieces. Seems like a rip off.  Let's get to the worst part.  Our time spent in the restaurant - TWO HOURS. This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things. \"I think we're missing naan.\"  \"Ohhh, right...\"    \"Did you need anything else?\"  \"Yes, the soup?\"  Then at the end of our poorly timed meal, plates still filled with food, they brought the check. Didn't ask if we wanted dessert, or boxes.  Now, the guy who brings the water and bussed the table: He was on the ball! Promote him to a server position, because the girls leisurely walking around the restaurant? Can't hack it.  I miss when this place was Pasand : (",

A little pricey though($10.95 (?) on weekdays & $12.95 on the weekends), but TOTALLY worth it..Huge selection of dishes (Brunch,Desserts) & great taste! I recommended this one to more than a dozen folks & everyone seemed to like it..They have idli/dosai/vada/pongal for b'fast & the sambar is good. Lot of veg/non-veg entrees to choose from & best part is the biryani(generally egg/chicken/goat, no veg) is included with the buffet! Wide variety of desserts & this is the only restaurant (from the ones I dined) that serves gulab-jamun HOT!   On the other side - Service is really bad & they'll need to improve by miles, if they want to get their act together!  Final Verdict: ANYTIME! ANYDAY!",

    "text": "Not good for Vegetarians!  I went for the \"special\" labor day buffet. This restaurant is the priciest Indian buffet in the valley as far as I know but they always raise the prices for occasions like labor day, Independence day, some Kerala festival etc.   At over $14 per person (including taxes), I expected better service and better food. I asked for a high chair for my son and the waiter acknowledged but when he didn't bring it, my wife politely reminded him. He still didn't bring it and I saw that they were having a busy day so I tried to bring it myself but couldn't find it. So I asked a different waitress for assistance. She took me to the original waiter and asked him to give me a high chair and somehow that seems to have upset him. He pretended that I was invisible and brusquely took the high chair and placed it at our table while I followed him. He hadn't looked at me then and made sure to avoid our table since! I was polite throughout so I couldn't see why he had to do that!  Also, the water we were served had some floating particles and when I pointed it out the waiter (or perhaps manager) took them away and sent one clean glass and another glass with floating particles!  The variety of food for vegetarians wasn't commensurate with the price. In particular, the only rice offered was \"mint rice\". It would have been nice to offer a vegetarian biryani since most of the appetizers were meat anyway. There was a notice at the buffet counter that Dosa and Naan would be served at the table but not once were we offered Dosa or Naan. We could help ourselves to naan though. And if I had waited for the Dosas to be replaced, I am sure I could have helped myself to Dosa too but why the notice of table service when they don't even ask once!   There was a decent variety of desserts but I can't say the same about the quality. The gulab jamuns were anything about round and were somewhat lumpy (undercooked perhaps?), the ice cream looked unappetizing although I hadn't tried it. Custard with fruits was okay.",

The food was alright, but the ability to sample North Indian, South Indian, Mughlai and Pav Bhaji at the same time was great. At around $13-$14, this is one of the pricier ones in Phoenix. The food is alright but I wouldn't really call it value for money. My favorite would have to be India Oven in Mesa that offers Mango Lassi (that I couldn't find anywherehere  even if it was offered) and a wider selection.",

Our server never said anything until after the food finally came. When we mentioned it had taken a long time, he said there was a new chef and then walked away.

Typically though, these are the places that I admire most because the food and service speak for itself. I've dined in more times than I can count and take out has been a breeze too. Garlic cauliflower is something I dream about. I drove from central Phoenix for it last night. These servers really do care about the business. I really do love butter chicken even though my server last night told me it's actually from a British chef. Not really Indian at all. So he recommended some more traditional dishes.

    "text": "My wife and I came here on Sunday  (4-10-2016). This place was pretty nice walking in. Without getting into details of the surroundings, let me get right into the food. I ordered a plate with lamb. I wish I could remember the name of the plate, but it was $18.00 and it was lamb, My wife had a spicy curry chicken (again, I don't remember the exact name). The lamb was a bit over cooked. It was a very \"well done\" (like leather) cut of meat. I've always cooked or ordered my lamb medium to medium rare, but I wasn't asked how I would like it cooked when my oder was taken. It came out on a hot iron skillet with veggies surrounding the lamb drying to a crisp. I was also given a Bowl of white rice to complete my plate.  On a scale of 1-10 for my order, I would give it a 4. The meat was to dry, veggies were dried as well. On the other hand, I like what they were doing with the flavor. Had the meat been rescued from the oven maybe 10 minutes earlier with about 5 minutes to rest, the plate would have been phenomenal!  Let me backup to drinks. They brought to our table a pitcher of water that had citrus slices and possibly mint marinating at the bottom. This water, although looking refreshing, was far from it. It was room temperature, if not warmer and served in room temperature glasses, not one cube of ice was even offered. So far this was the only type of drink we were offered. My wife finally asked a table runner if we could order drinks, he quickly got the attention of a waiter (not ours). I ordered an iced tea, my wife ordered a really good orange looking drink (mango lassi). Iced tea is supposed to have ice in it. I literally counted 3 cubes of ice. I didn't want to be rude and ask for ice so my wife \"manned up\" and got ice.........for herself! \"im still running warm here guys\"! End of the drink story. At the end of our dinner, our waiter gave us free desert cubes (those were amazing). I agreed to give my honest review of this restaurant just as I promised our waiter and here it is.  In all, the service was slow (took close to 35 minutes), my food was over-cooked, the drinks were warm (No ice) and we had to ask for our drinks. So will I go back? Absolutely! This is a review that I know they will read. I'll order the same thing, hopefully be given the option on how I would like my lamb cooked, hopefully be given iced water, hopefully they will ask for my drink order and hopefully those drinks will be nice and cold with lots of ice.  One thing I forgot to mention. The workers there were so extremely nice, very welcoming! That alone would get me to go back as well. Smiling faces are always a huge plus and there was no lack of smiling faces there. Kudos to you guys!",

My boyfriend and I are quite picky when it comes to our vegetarian paneer tikki masala and saag aloo. The masala was rich with butter and sweet notes, definitely recommend opting for a level 5 or 6 on the spicy scale to balance out the sweetness. The saag aloo was savory with a noticeable layering of herbs and spices. One entree alone is enough to share, but we love our leftovers.   We thoroughly enjoyed our service from our waitress, she was knowledgable of the menu and encouraged us to try the samosas with our salad. They were delicious especially when accompanied by a trio of flavorful toppings. She also recommended we try two different naans. Who were we to say no to more bread? Our favorite was the garlic naan, without a doubt. We were informed that their naans were cooked on a charcoal grill which definitely showcased in it's light and chewy texture.   We know we will return, simply for the fact that we've been craving it ever since we left.",

We had a table of 12 and everyone was very happy with their food, lamb, chicken, appetizers - everything came out delicious. The service was great as well. We didn't tell them it was a special occasion but they picked up on it and brought out a plate of ice cream for everyone on the house which I thought was a great touch. Especially, since I've been to places where we told them it was a special occasion and they did nothing extra. So it that little extra attention was appreciated.   This place used to be Pasand awhile back and I gotta say it has improved a lot. The decor, the food, the service - everything is much better now. We'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "My first experience at Chutney's was a decent one overall.  I arrived at the restaurant around 8pm, which seems to be a bit late for eating out in Tempe unless you're near the university.  The dining room and entrance/lobby is a bit dated, but appeared to be kept very clean.  Outside, the restaurant is barely lit, the parking lot and sidewalks almost non-existent.  I would recommend earlier dining just on that alone.  The staff was pleasant, very attentive,  and the food ordered was all delicious.  I've made a note to come back early one afternoon on a weekend when the buffet is operational just so I can sample other dishes to review.  This time I ordered the Apollo Fish, the Lamp Tikka Masala w/ Kashmiri Rice, Vegetable Pakora, Saffron Rice, Mango Chutney, and a Mango Lassi (smoothie drink).    First, I would highly recommend the Mango Lassi, it was a great palette cleanser between courses, and offered some sweet relief when the spices began to burn.  Next, I would recommend the Lamb Tikka Masala, the meat was tender, the Red Tomato Curry sauce along with the Kashmiri Rice was bright, crisp and fragrant.    I personally did not care for the Apollo Fish, I simply believe this was just a personal preference. More of a texture hang up that I had with the type of fish and the amount of spices  while it was prepared (but to each their own).  Overall though, like I stated earlier, I plan to return and take advantage of the buffet to get a broader sampling of Chutney's.",

I have also tried the weekend buffet many times, and most items are extremely delicious and very authentic. They even have a buffet of desserts from different parts of the country, which is very cool. The owner is a great guy as well, and he explains the menu options with great patience. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to try great authentic Indian food at a very reasonable price. 5 stars from me! :-)",

    "text": "I wanted to go back to Chutney's b/c the first (and until today, only) time I'd visited their lunch buffet, it was Superbowl Sunday, and I felt like I left with kind of a personally negative experience; not that it was the restaurant's fault, but I hate (a) crowds (b) football so, you can imagine.   I chose a Monday b/c - and I don't think this is listed on their website - but I googled their prices, and they're one of the restaurants in the area that charges a little more on the weekends than on weekdays, and I chose to update this review just to say that the difference in price is reflected in a difference, not in quality, but in quantity of food. Noticeably (and irrelevant to my enjoyment), the BIG dessert I had seen on the Sunday previous was absent.   But, there was still an ample spread - several chicken dishes, three rice options (chicken biryani, peas pulao, plain basmati), four desserts (gulab jamun, fruit custard, kheer, and I don't remember the name, but the sweet vermicelli dessert), several chutneys, fresh fruits, naan and dosa, and in veg options - rajma rasila, aloo methi, rava upma, matar paneer, and maybe something else I'm forgetting. All of the dishes were different from the last time I visited, so I imagine they'd be different still if I visited again.  The atmosphere was also decidedly more my speed - not as full (but still doing good business), with chill instrumental music (mostly wooden flute).   I don't think I'm going to make this my go-to Indian buffet just b/c there are a couple places I liked yet more - not b/c they're better, necessarily, just for extremely specific personal preference reasons. BUT, I will 100% be back for their mushroom pepper fry, which I have not stopped thinking about for the past three weeks, and I would not discourage anyone else from going.",

I have seen a lot of Indian restaurants make a similar mistake: They try to serve too many items by sacrificing the quality instead of focusing on delivering a select number of great items.

It came out individually and so everyone was out of sync. This is especially a problem when the adults food is there but not the kids ! The food itself was totally inedible. Runny vegetables, tough meat, cold starters , overly spicy soup. It was generally a nightmare to eat at and a lot of the food seemed like it was frozen prior to being cooked. The butter chicken was also lost all marsala (see picture). When we complained the manager (owner) disagreed which was really not doing him any favours. We didn't eat most of the food, got charged inflated prices for stuff which should be been cheaper even if it was good quality, and left hungry. Saved your money and go somewhere else - even Mcdonalds. Would give it ZERO stars if I could",

After being loyal to Delhi Palace and a few others that recently have gone down the drain in terms of service or quality of the food or, especially, cleanliness and decor. I asked my Indian friends for recommendations and was given Chutney's info. To Yelp I went.   My father has been all over the world and is very critical of Americanized ethnic food but I brought him here and he was SO happy! We came for the lunch buffet, which was fantastic. I wished there were more dishes out that were without dairy, but the few that were there were fantastic and I left full but not feeling like I'd just eaten a grease bomb. Indian food can be very heavy and fatty, much of which I steer clear of now. The Naan on the buffet was cold and should have been replenished quicker than it was, but all the other dishes were amazing, especially the lentil dahl and the carrot halwah dessert.   I will certainly return to this place.",

It was a sad occasion and we did not return because of the association to Chutney's.  After a *year* we returned because we were in the area and the manager recognized us and welcomed us back! That is *service*. He remembered our friend and seemed genuinely saddened by his passing as it was his favorite place for Indian cuisine.  I like coming here for dinner, because I can ask for exactly how spicy I would like it. Chutney's makes it hot.. so deliciously hot I have only had few that can compare.

Usually Indian places are too bland for my tastes as they try to appeal to the masses.  Chutney's seems to hit a nice medium level.    Unfortunately the food was cold.  I visited at noon and a lot of the dishes seemed to be full.  I don't know if the buffet setup is incorrect - not many lids and the Tandori was covered in tinfoil - or perhaps the food was prepared ahead of time.  The place is obviously still under renovation - you can tell by the pile of junk outside the front door - so maybe the buffet is still under renovation as well.  The service was friendly but when I ordered an iced tea, the waiter brought me pre-sweetened tea.  Granted I didn't specify so perhaps it's my fault - but it did take a while for them to bring me an unsweetened tea.  I think the buffet was a bit of a bust but the food was tasty enough that I would like to try the dinner menu.  I have high hopes.",

It has a banquet hall or sizzler feel that doesn't match the mid to high price point for the entrees.   - Service: The service seems forced and a bit arrogant. The one waiter seemed to have little to no knowledge of what was in stock in the bar, and he poured and served me the wrong beverage. When I asked about there being another location, the server downplayed the other location stating that the Tempe location is bigger and has more chefs. He literally snarled his nose as he was talking about it and telling me not to go there, to come to the Tempe location.   - Alcohol: If you're ordering draft beer, you should be aware that it's a 10 ounce pour at 12 oz to 16 oz prices.    - Prices: While the prices are not wildly out of line like some places I've visited, the things I mention above make me feel as though Chutney's should be offering a lower price for a less than premium product. They were slightly more than the best curry restaurant I've found in town.",

    "text": "It's strictly average. I went along with 6 friends based on a friends recommendation. Let me start with the server who forces you to try a drink you don't want to. He gave us a 5 minute monologue on how good this new drink is. It might be the best drink in the world, but the way they try to sell it you is beyond me. I'd rather have the drink do all the talking than the server.   We ordered Cheese Masala Dosa's which were good. They weren't heavy enough so we ended up ordering Daal, Malai Paneer & some Naan. We all know Malai Paneer is inherently sweet, so we made sure we ask them if they make it differently(spicy) before ordering. The guy gave us a puzzled look saying that it's not at all sweet and will be very spicy. Alas, it was sweet! To be fair them, the cook was kind enough to make it again with extra spices. It was better but again a little sweet. Daal was good and so was the Basil Naan(highly recommended).   I wouldn't be going back anytime soon. I've tried there lunch buffet as well and wasn't impressed. Oh and I hope they improve their mediocre service & reduce their prices. It took them 15 minutes to take our order.",

The variety on offer was superb -- both South and North Indian dishes -- and the dessert menu was delectable.   However, in the recent past -- a couple of months at the very least -- the variety on offer has sharply dwindled. Where once the entire buffet slate used to be full of different dishes, now the desserts (sweets) take up about one-third of the original buffet space.   Added to the high price of the weekend lunch buffet (north of $13 per person), Chutneys has become a very poor choice indeed. Buyer beware!",

    "text": "We ordered delivery through Yelp. The whole process was very confusing and seemed to confuse the staff as much as it confused us when I called to ask some questions. The reason why that is frustrating is because I expect an establishment to be able to help me through a service they offer, and not refer me to a website that refers me to a customer support number.  We received an underwhelming amount of food for the cost, and the veggie samosas were burnt to the point of being inedible. They were so hot when they were put in their styrofoam container that they burned a large hole in the bottom. I've attached pictures of the amounts of food and the burned samosas. The delivery person rounded the total of $45.27 to $46 when he gave me the price of the food. This probably seems nitpicky, but it im in the food service industry and I think it's lazy and dishonest to do this. I'm really disappointed. Won't be eating food from this establishment again.",

    "text": "I've now been to Chutneys three times, and each time I've been introduced to something WONDERFUL!    Each time, I've been with a large group (10-20), so have had the opportunity to see what others have ordered, and get to taste a lot of other items.   One of my favorite appetizers is the garlic cauliflower.  I'm not a big fan of a lot of heat, so am thrilled that you can designate your heat.  I'm a 3-4 on a scale of 10.  Sooo good!   On this outing, I opted for the butter chicken. Large chunks of tender chicken in a creamy, yummy tomato yogurt sauce.  Served with rice, I could lick the bowl clean.    We tried several varieties of naan - plain, rosemary and cheese.  The cheese is almost like a quesadilla. All good.   My friend had their grilled lamb chops - amazing.   A few ordered the sizzling seafood platters (I'm allergic, so couldn't try it) but they loved it.    The owner came in to chat with us, and you could tell how much he cares about the food he serves.  He has a lot of respect for his chef, and takes pride in the musical entertainment provided.   The only thing preventing me from giving 5 stars is the service.  The staff are all caring, friendly and helpful.  But all three times we've been there, the service was disjointed and slow.  Some people waited over 30 minutes to get their beverage.  A few entrees arrived after the rest of us were finished.  The bills are often mixed up. It took over 15 minutes to get our credit cards back after we paid.  Maybe it wouldn't be such a problem if we were a small group.   No matter that - the food is well worth the wait. Just be patient.",

The restaurant boasts a variety of indian food on their menu which you are unlikely to find elsewhere in US. Of course the traditional butter chicken, tikka masala etc. are also served.  So far I have had their Garlic Cauliflower and Tawa Corn for appetizers. Cauliflower was awesome, corn recipe could be improved, but still pretty good. I was very happy to find a spicy corn dish on the menu finally which is a rareity. Andhra chicken curry  did not taste anything like the andhra curry I have had at other places, nevertheless, it tasted very good. Methi malai paneer was tasty as well. The whole wheat tandoori roti was nice. We finished the meal with a delightful malai kulfi for dessert.   Indian food is best when served steaming hot. They served all the curries on cute little stands with a little lamp underneath to keep the food warm. Again, something unique for indian restaurants in US. The owners were very enthusiastic about the food they served and we enjoyed our conversation with them.    I must also note that they had really clean well maintained restrooms , something I have never seen in any other average Indian restaurant in US.",

    "text": "Chutney's by far has the best Indian food I've ever tasted in Arizona. The lunch buffets are excellent, and so are the dinners. My family friends introduced me to this restaurant when I moved here from Oklahoma back in November. Indians in particular will be picky about Indian restaurants because our moms already cook the best food, but I have nothing but great things to say about this place. I'm away from home, so this is the second best thing to my mom's home-cooked food.   Service: The owners are extremely friendly and go out of their way to tend to their customers at all times. After noticing that my friend and I have finished our meals, one of the owners came by and brought us kulfis (ice cream) to taste before we even got up to get dessert ourselves. When I asked if they had pistachio, he went to the kitchen to bring me out pistachio kulfi. So sweet!  Seating: There are booths as well as tables with chairs. They accommodate large groups as well putting tables together so everyone can sit with each other.   Food: EVERYTHING, and I am not exaggerating, everything is so delicious and more than so, authentic tasting absent of creams to make the dishes less spicy like a lot of Indian restaurants in America tend to do. I believe they use yogurt or blended cashew cream instead of heavy cream so the food doesn't taste as heavy and fattening.   I'll just go ahead and describe some of the many delectable dishes they serve here:  Rice:   *Chicken biryani* The chicken pieces are well seasoned and moist, not dry. For the buffets, they have rice cookers with copious amounts of chicken biryani in them.   *Veggie Palao* flavorful and not dry  *Naan* not burnt- that's probably the best thing you can say about naan. Also fluffy, and has that tandoor taste to it.  *Dosa* they serve a large-sized dosa, as it should be. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, which enables you to still rip apart the bread and dip it in either coconut chutney, tomato chutney, and sambar, which are served with the dosa.  *Chicken Saag* Chicken pieces cooked in a creamy spinach curry. One of my favorite dishes from Chutney's. I love dipping naan in this and eating it with rice, too.  *Chaat* not stale. The one thing I cannot stand about restaurant style chaat is how stale it can get. Every time I have been to Chutney, the chaat is always fresh. Good job!  *All of the veggies* All of the vegetable curries other vegetable dishes are  so fresh.   *Desserts* oh my gosh, they have SOOO many options! From beet halwa, carrot halwa, different flavors of kulfi (mango, strawberry, pistachio, pineapple), gulab jamun  I highly recommend coming here if you are on the lookout for some authentic-tasting Indian food. If you can handle a little spice and taste some REAL Indian food, please come here!",

The cooks take pride in what they make and it shows in the flavor and presentation.  I'm partial to the lamb vindaloo, which I'm sure I misspelled. They ask you for spice level from 1-10 and 10 will light you up but it will not lose its flavor. The garlic naan is out of this world and if you like heat, get the naan infused with habaneros.  I usually get the samosas to start but tried the garlic cauliflower, can't go wrong with either.  There are a lot on the menu I haven't tried but I will be back every time I'm in the area.",

We got in our family when they visited us with big hopes for a great evening and were extremely disappointed.  Please understand. We didn't come to eat for free. Don't treat customers like you are doing a favour serving us food.   We were a regular customer. But disappointed and will never return.   P.S -  their menu says raita with rice and biryani but they will charge your for the raita separately. When we asked them, they said that we were wrong and that their menu doesn't say so. Here is the proof. Check the photo.  It's funny how you want to be so defensive when you bill us for something we didn't even order. Plus the attitude.",

I admit that I have driven past it several times over the years because restaurants that don't have windows kind of sketch me out.  I decided to give it a chance and try their lunch buffet so I could figure out what kind of Indian food I like and don't like.  The owners were welcoming and accommodating the music was nice and the food was good my favorite was the cauliflower appetizer dish and the garlic chicken with naan from the buffet.

They have a great choice on their buffet and it's not over $14. Thank you. Good luck",

I wasn't feeling too great when I went (getting a cold, couldn't taste too well) and I will say I could still smell that the food was insanely delectable! I knew for sure I'd go back again when I was feeling better so I could truly appreciate the unique flavors. I ordered the Chana masala but really wanted the Gobi manchurian as it's a fave. Next time . I'll get that. The naan was great, service was top knotch, super attentive, friendly and helpful. I found Chutney's while traveling through the area and craving some good indian food. So glad for yelp that helps me find the best places! The strawberry dessert was a nice touch, better than expected! Highly recommend Chutney's.",

Biggest part of this is attributed to the amazingly hard-working and considerate owner. Despite having multiple tables to check up on, he made us feel like we were the only ones in the house, fully explaining the menu in detail, even down to cooking styles and ingredient sources. We felt truly like family here.  The food itself just added to the great experience we had. At first, it seems like they might just be blowing smoke, but the way they describe their dishes in such a delicious way is very much understated. We got the garlic cauliflower, naan bread, and veggie kabob. Then a side of rice, another appetizer, and their tomato soup. We couldn't stop! Everything was absolutely phenomenal. And, the best part, we felt full without that groggy, lethargic feeling all night!  I will be suggesting this restaurant to everyone I come by in Tempe. Really has become a staple. You must try!",

I don't know what's with the color, they put too much color in food. Like the fish pakora or the grilled chicken. To me it looks unhealthy! And who puts color in \"sooji ka halwa\" !!

Inside a tired strip mall sits this well appointed indian spot, which was a buffet for our saturday lunch. ~ $12.50 each.  Pick up a plate and some Styrofoam cups for the sauces and get started. It starts with the starch, rice, flavored rice, a polenta like item and rice pillows. Then move on to the soups. After the soup the main event begins, You will fist be greeted by vegetarian dishes that become less vegan to a egg dish a fish dish then the full on meat.   A few dishes here were new to me, like the egg masla, it had a great flavor with the sauteed onion and Masala seasoning.  Next are the name sake of this place, the chutneys which were decent but again not as bold, which may be good if you have a mid-west palette.  The real surprise here was the huge desert buffet, it has the usual galub, keer but it also had items I have never seen like fried bread in a mango syrup and a dal based sweet sauce that is like caramel.    If you want to try a few new items or have a taste for the bland give this place a try.",

In fact, my wife an I returned on a first Friday to catch the live jazz.    However, let's get to the meat and potatoes of this review.  One of the things I enjoy eating is the naan bread.  Their naan is prepared in a tandoori oven which gives the bread an excellent consistency and flavor.  We have had different dishes each visit and they have been very consistent with presentation and taste.  A few months ago, I decided to bring my Toastmasters group in for their Chef's Table.  If you have not experienced this, you are missing a True treat.  This six course meal will leave you very satisfied and VERY full.  The Mullitgitawny soup was sublime with its delicate balance of flavors.  The show stopper was the garlic cauliflower.  To this date, I still run into Toastmasters who talk about how good this dish was.  The 65 chicken is also very tasty.  I have been relaying these raves back to Shilpa, the manager and she leaves with a smile on her face.  The main entrees of choice are very tasty and customers are given a choice of spicy or mild.  The desserts are pretty tasty as well.  Speaking of Shilpa, she is a delight to work with.  I worked very closely with her in setting this up.  She did everything promised and then some.  Any concerns I had were dealt with in a very professional and expedient manner.  But even if we don't do the chef's table often, we will still return because of the quality of the food and the excellent live jazz that leaves a good note with us.",

My only real complaint (and what's keeping this place from 5 stars) was the price. $14 for a lunch buffet is a bit steep in my opinion - plus they ask for a tip. I don't normally tip at buffets but I was too intimidated to not leave one as I had to do that right in front of the cashier.

Every dish tastes so different and distinctive. The lamb was a little over cooked in the saagwala, but it was still SOOO good. The samosa are so exciting for what is typically a very basic item. Everything I've ever tried is outstanding. The restaurant is so cute inside too, it's a fun, fresh, chic dining experience without trying too hard. I love this place! The owner is so awesome and proud. He is very good at what he does, and he makes every diner feel special and valued, like it's his first day running a restaurant. Every day. I recommend this to anyone who is craving good Indian food and a fun, special dining experience.",

I like it a lot - the lamb curry, chicken tikka massala, and other foods you would expect to be there are outstanding!   However....it just took EXTREMELY long for the food to come out and there was some type of miscommunication between the server and the kitchen because 3 out of the 5 orders at our table were wrong and it's been around 45 min to an hour wait time. Since we were hungry, we took the food anyway - but it WAS good!  So all in all - not bad food wise.    For some reason or another - the service we got that day was extremely slow and flustered (which may come off as a first world problem). Despite that, I would still give this place another try because I truly enjoyed the food when we finally got it.   With an attitude of gratitude I see the bright side that I actually got to eat that day as opposed to many that are struggling in the world - I can't bad mouth the place.  I was fed.",

The palak paneer was probably the best dish.  The keema's spices were overpowering and was hard to eat.  The tikka masala was ok, but seemed to be missing something.

We were looking forward to the dosas that are seen on the website.  The \"dosas\" served at the buffet were like thick doughy pancakes that were lukewarm.  The naan bread is cooked ahead and is kept warm on the buffet line, not hot and fresh.  The currys, paneer, and Dahl were not bad, but I'd rate them as average.  I showed the waitress a photo of the dosas from their website and she said they are available at dinnertime. Considering what they called a dosa at their lunch buffet, I have my doubts that they can make one worth returning at dinner time for.",

We were the first to be seated in our section, but the LAST to be served. Our meal turned out to be a two hour dinner, our server was no where to be found and the owner was as clueless as the staff. We noticed that all the \"natives\" were served first before everyone else, which is a HORRIBLE way to do business.   The food was decent when we got it 75 minutes after we were first seated. It took 15 minutes to ask someone to get our bill and when the so-called server returned, he didn't even bring one. They are lucky that I didn't dine and dash, but I bet that they wouldn't have even noticed.   The service needs to improve or they won't last. But I wouldn't even waste your time or money going here because they honestly don't care about improving.",

He told me point blank that the buffet will be closed at 2:40 PM and I have to eat in 20 mins. No restaurant will ask you to \"eat\" in 20 mins. They will just ask you to make sure you take all that you need from the buffet in 20 mins and finish within a reasonable time. where do they get these \"bozos\" from? My wife just reminded me that he mentioned we have to pick up everything we need in \"5 mins\". Are we near Armageddon?  First of all, the advertisement says buffet is open till 3 PM. He was damn rude and reminded me of my hostel warden in India. I am a regular customer and go there at least once a week, sometimes with customers.   It is ironical that they got a new guy to fix the problem and he is only making things worse.",

I am a vegetarian, decided to eat the Idli-Vada combo. The sides-coconut chutney, tomato chutney, and Sambar- were beautifully presented in 3 small bowls, separately. Idlis usually dont make it on my \"to-eat\" dishes at any restaurant, because by evening they dry out. But these were soft and fully cooked. The Medhu Vada was done perfectly. Crispy, crunchy, and tasty. I also had samosas, and the accompanying chutneys( tamarind sweet chutney, and cilantro mint) were tasty too. My husband, found South Indian style Chicken Sukha( dry ), and enjoyed it immensely. The Egg biryani was also quite tasty. Rice was fully cooked, and they give quite a generous portion. Price wise, probably same or at par with most other Indian restaurants in the valley. Non veg dishes come at 10.95 to 11.95. and whatever I had was under 12 dollars. The staff told me that their buffet spread is extensive, and weekends they offer more variety.   Definitely a Must try!!! We will go back again, if possible.",

First, the food was cold which made the chicken kind of hard and everything in general much less enjoyable. Plus the flavors were really mild compared to actual Indian food. The butter chicken was okay but was really watery. There was a good vegetable variety so I guess that is good for vegetarian people. The service was kind too.  Although it wasn't a bad experience, it wasn't memorable at all. I don't think I would come back for the buffet.

The wait staff is very friendly, kind, and patient for a Friday night.  And the food. My wife and I went for dinner and ordered the Masaledar Lamb Chops and the Nilgiri Lamb curry, with some Roti. Both dishes were spiced 5/10 and were wonderful with and without the bread! The best Indian Food we have found in our immediate area. I would recommend this place (at least for dinner) 5 times out of 5.  I also wish to mention that we are on a very strict diet and we're able to eat here for less than $50. Score!",

My favorites so far are the tadka dal and the chana masala. They are wonderful! The rice is also very mildly seasoned with bay leaves and something else. It's the best rice I've ever had on the side anywhere. And it comes free with entrees, not sure what others are talking about who said they paid for rice, unless it's biryani or extra rice or something. I highly recommend this place. I can't wait to branch out and try more on the menu!  UPDATE: We've been to the restaurant now and we love it. Go check it out- you won't be disappointed!",

The only reason im giving 1 star is because i use yelp to help me find really yummy food. So unfortuantely you wont get that here. BUT you will get a lot, and i mean A LOT of variety. SO if you are in the mood to try many different things i would recommend this place. I do think they should reduce the number of dishes and focus more on taste. Key things to change immediately: desserts: change the ice cream recipe because its way too sweet and the sugar overpowers the flavor so you cant tell what flavor its supposed to be. Gajar ka halwa: reduce the amount of condense milk or whatever you add. cant taste the carrots and ive never been able to (its been a year now). Reduce the amount of desserts present and focus on the Chai (add more masala and milk). Everyone ends the meal with chai so its important that its good.  If possible, add south indian coffee to the weekend buffet and reduce the amount of desserts you have. the gulab jamun is finally really good!!! it was also very sweet (95% of the desserts you serve at the buffet are too sweet and often mask the taste of the dish. Its still good but thats because im eating sugar. it would be better if you could taste what the dish is supposed to taste like)  the dahi vada here is SO GREAT! thats never bad and neither is the fruit. I recently discovered amaravati in may 2018, and since then ive been choosing between the two. I went to chutneys Diwali buffet this past weekend and was so disappointed because it just wasnt good and wished i had done to amaravati. the variety at chutneys was spectacular and thats what convinced me to choose chutneys over amarvati this past weekend but the food was not yummy at all. Prior to may 2018 i would always go to chutneys. I think as of now, the only restaurant chutneys is competing with is amaravati. All the other restaurants are below both these restaurants. So i would recommend amaravati first then chutneys.  GOODLUCK!",

Huge assortment of vegetarian fare, but also plenty of meat/chicken/lamb/fish for those so inclined.  Complimentary pappadum and condiments to enjoy while you peruse the menu.  We started with the garlic cauliflower, lightly battered and deep fried in a spicy red sauce. Delicious.  I ordered one of the paneer curries (fenugreek and cream sauce), which was delicately flavored. My husband had the mango lamb curry, perfectly spiced and stewed. Presentation was also excellent. Ample quantities, so we'll be enjoying the leftovers tomorrow too. Pricing was reasonable as well.  In summary, a well-deserved five stars.

They also serve Papadum with 3 different types of dipping sauce. For entree, I ordered a sweet chicken Korma curry dish. The curry sauce was absolutely favorable with the right amount of chicken.   Service was absolutely outstanding. The manager (possibly the owner), our waiter and a guy who delivers food from the kitchen to the floor all work together to provide everyone with services.

My husband always gets the Butter Chicken, and I've had several different dishes. The Methi Malai is awesome, and so are the fish dishes and the curries. We always get the garlic naan too. So good! We recently decided to try the mango ice cream and we are so glad we did. We get it every time now. The wait staff are extremely helpful and attentive, and I often just take their suggestion on what to order. We are never disappointed!",

    "text": "WoW, where do I start... We went here for the Sunday buffet and then went back for dinner the following Friday.  The buffet was pretty good, a little spicy, but that wasn't a bad thing at all. They had a live dosa station but they only offered plain dosa's which was a little disappointing. The buffet had a 70/30 mix of South Indian and North Indian dishes and and also a bhel station.   The dinner was average. I ordered the malai kofta, Punjabi paneer and garlic naan. My friends ordered a chili onion uttapam, chicken tikka masala, lamb saag, and a masala dosa. All were pretty bland as in lack of Indian spices/seasonings.  The food was average so I give it 3 stars, decor was modern and restaurant overall was very clean so that would bump the rating up to 3.5 stars...  So here is why they get only one star... Their waiters and staff have no concept of how to split a ticket! First at the lunch buffet we were a party of 6. We all got the buffet and I had a beer with my meal. We needed the tickets split as such, 2:2:1:1. First they just dropped the check off, didn't tell or ask anyone if it was all separate or together, and it had everyone's tab on the same check. So then we asked for it to be split as mentioned above it took them three tries and 40 minutes and it still wasn't right. We finally got so frustrated that we worked something out ourselves and left. I mean, cmon, how hard is it to split up a check with only buffet charges on it???!!!  Theeeeeeen, when we returned for dinner and after the lunch check debacle, we told our waiter to split the checks up front because of what had happened last time. He said he would take our orders on one check and then split them at the time of the bill. We were a party of 8 this time and we looked at each other and reluctantly agreed. That turned out to be the ultimate mistake! Our actual ordering and eating time? 1 hour. Time spent on these knuckle heads trying to split our check, no joke... 1 hour! A whole friggin hour!!!   Things that happened within this hour: check once again was not split initially, waiter had the audacity to ask me to initial each persons order and then he would create the separate tickets (so I am now doing his job) still was not correct. Manager \"takes charge\" and tabulates new checks, still not correct. Sister gets pissed, actually takes charge, writes each out individual check, see included pic. Manager feels bad, gives us all a free dessert, doesn't give my sister a spoon for it lol! We finally get our checks and depart grumbling and ready to eat again since it took so long just to get our checks.   Moral of the story: if you eat here, and want your check split, DON'T DO IT!!!",

    "text": "Want to try something a little bit different? When I do, I head over to Chutney's for some savory and spicy indian and indoasian cuisine.  There are dishes here that are famliar favorites along with some dishes that have a more heavy indoasian take, that may not be available readily in the valley.   There is a HUGE parking lot with bike parking as this restaurant is located in a strip mall.  The inside is rather large and includes a banquet hall for holiday parties and other occasion where one may rent the space out and have an event catered.    The service was a little sparce in the begining, however I did come at the busy lunch hour.  There wasn't anyone to greet me when I came in, however within a few mins someone came out of the kitchen to check on the front of house and he welcomed me and showed me my seat. Lunch time offers a buffet with some appetizers (various fritters depending on the day and dosa) sambar, sauces and salad. They have several types of rice including and interesting fried rice that looks what you may get with chinese takeout, however the spice profile is more complex and similar to what you would get in a biryani. The offer several main dishes with familair faves like butter chicken & paneer masala and some indoasian treats like mushroom or baby corn maruchan. You really need to try this for your self, but for me its like two of my favorite types of food had a beautiful baby! I love the savory taste of the chinese inspired ingredients along with the myriad spices used in traditional indian cuisine.   There is also Chai tea and dessert avialable. None have ever stood out at this location yet, but its nice that they have them at the end of the meal.   Come by during thier lunch buffet and give it a try!",

I had been once before (I can't believe I didn't review...) for the lunch buffet about a year or two ago and it was really good... there was a wide variety of food and all was tasty....anyway, flash forward to last week, I went for dinner with a friend. We were one of two parties there and it was eerily quiet. Our waitress was a bit odd, but nice enough... the food was expensive and they were trying to push drinks and appetizers and whatnot....I felt like they were a bit disappointed when we just shared one entree and some naan. We got the chicken tikka masala, and it was good, but not as good as I had remembered it from the buffet. About half way through the meal, we were the only people in the restaurant (at like 6:45), and it felt like the employees were all staring at us...they had nothing else to do, it was just an odd feeling. I would consider going back for the lunch buffet, but don't think I would eat there for dinner again.",

That is what we saw at Chutney's. We were there yesterday for dinner. The food was very slow to come even though they hardly had any customers. The wait staff spent most of the time inside the kitchen and not outside looking out for customers who need service. When we asked for the bill, they took 15 minutes to even have it ready. And when it did come, we were overcharged for a few items. When I send it back to be fixed, it did not come for another 15 minutes. I had to finally go and pay for it at the register. I would never ever go back here again.",

But yesterday it was just the opposite. Sambhar was even worser than the dosa and uttapam. There was no taste whatsover. It felt like drinking some masala water.  This was not our first time. We tried their buffet as well 6 months back. We were disappointed then as well. Chicken and potato curry were totally uncooked. I could not even cut the potatoes with my spoon. But yesterday we would give another try and after yesterday's experience, we would never go again there. For the price they are charging they should serve much better food. Morever, there are better indian restaurants close by.",

    "text": "We were craving Indian food today and thought we would give this place another try. We tried it once after it was purchased and no longer Pasand's (which we loved). The food wasn't very good but we thought it was because they had just opened and we would try again at a later time. I looked on Yelp and there were mixed reviews but thought we would take a chance.  That being said we arrived and were very suprised that the inside had been re-vamped and was quite nice. The host was pleasant and we were seated right away.  We chose the lunch buffet and were impressed with the selection of entrees, soups and desserts. The food was just ok and I defintitely agree with past reviews that they really need to do something to keep the naan warm on the buffet or bring it fresh like most other restaurants. The real issue came when it was time for our check.  We sat for about 10 minutes after we had finished eating.  I finally went and found one of the waitresses to request our check. We then waited another 10 minutes and got up and went over to the cash register. Apparently, their credit card machine was down and they were trying to reboot.  This happens, we understand, but it didn't just happen. She knew about it when we asked for the check and didn't come back to tell us the situation. I could have left and went to the bank and got cash while my co-worker stayed there so there wouldn't have been an issue. They chose not to tell us, make us wait, and then proceed to write our credit card numbers on a torn peice of paper and hand the credit card back to us and not even say - here is your total, I appologize for your wait and the inconvience etc...- No he hands the cards back to us and takes the next persons card in line (did I mention there is a 10 person line at this time). Fortunate for the guys behind us they had time and were going to run to the bank while one guy stayed there to wait. Unfortunately for us, we needed to be back at work and had to leave our numbers just sitting out in the open for all to see:( We just hope our cards are charged correctly and our credit information is secure. We will not be going back to this restaurant and will drive the extra 8 miles to India Oven.",

    "text": "This place used to be really good. I've been here a couple of times, the first time being the best experience I've had at this restaurant. Subsequent visits have seen a decrease in quality of service and food. My most recent visit was probably the worst experience I've had at a restaurant. The service was terrible. The waiter didn't seem completely knowledgeable about the menu, but that was the least of our problems. We waited about 1 hour and 15 minutes for our food to arrive. Other people in the restaurant who had arrived after us received their food before us. We decided to wait patiently assuming that our food took longer to prepare. When we asked the waiter what was taking so long he told us it would be a short wait and that we were \"next in line\". However, after telling us that there was a table across from us who ordered the same dish about 25 minutes after we had ordered it and they received their food before us. Once again we waited, but after another 20 minutes of waiting we decided to leave. Either they botched our order or they were playing favorites with the customers. We told the waiter we were leaving and he didn't say anything and that was it. I won't be coming back here again.",
