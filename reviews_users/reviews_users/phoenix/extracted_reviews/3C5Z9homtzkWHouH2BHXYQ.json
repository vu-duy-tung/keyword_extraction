If you want to have a conversation, the noise level in the evening is going to make that difficult.  between the music and the high ceilings you will need your loud voice--  I give the place credit for a wonderful reuse of space.  visually that restaurant is spectacular and it is worth going once just for that.    The service is hot and cold. I got there early for dinner and was seated immediately.  I finally had to get someone's attention after 10 minutes or so --to get a glass of wine and some water.  to the waiter's credit--there was an apology for the wait--but i really hate being ignored--some sort of acknowledgement is all that is needed to lower that frustration even if they can't get to you immediately.  I also have to say for the rest of the evening the service was fine.  Now the food--it is okay--Unless they really do something to improve it--it will never be the reason why people come here.  Someone in our party ordered one taco--even on a salad size plate--it was very very small--for $4 a taco you just expect them to be extraordinary of which they are definitely not.  I had a chicken burrito--it was okay--chick was dry and not much flavor.    If you want really good food--go to your favorite neighborhood place or someplace like gallo blanco or richardson's.    Taco Guild will be fine to meet for happy hour and a drink--but there are much better places to spend your dining $$$ for good food.",

It always looks closed when I go by but it was really full when we went inside. The door was opened by a guy with huge sideburns and he was happy and helpful. We were taken to a booth really quick and it was seamless. Perfect. Our server was a nice kid. Quick and full of smiles. Brought me a Rita and beans for the kiddo on the fly.  Have I mentioned he ambience is awesome? It's a really cool churchy old town Mexico feel.  The salsa and chips were good. The kiddo loved them. The guac and queso came mixed together which was alright I guess, flavor was odd but enjoyable.  Had a pork taco on corn and a duck taco. Both were pretty good. I'd eat them again for sure.  All in all a good experience. As with most taco places it can be hit or miss with each build. The lady will want to check it out too, so I know I'll be back.",

    "text": "Ok the food is tastey, and the atmosphere is welcoming and very comfortable.  However here's the rub (for myself anyway) very little food for. I went to taco guild on a recent week nite along with two friends. We all agreed the food was tastey and the atmosphere very nice. Its 3.75 or 3.95 for each taco at first I thought it seemed a bit on the high side price wise but I thought well this is a gastro pub and the tacos are going to be special, so I went with it. I ordered 3 vegetarian tacos and one side I choose corn off the cob. My companions choose 3 chicken tacos withe the side of corn.  Now when the food arrived we were all surprised at how small the tacos were and they were small. The side of corn was tiny also. The chips and salsa were a nice addition however the small amount of salsa they give you means you need to continously request a refill. Now we ate our food and. Enjoyed the atmosphere. We all had the same feeling we were all still hungry.   There are so many fancy restaurants in the phx sctsdale area. And as always it seeems like the main foucus is on making sure the plates and the decour are posh and that there's expensive art. And the food may be delicious. How ever you pay for the atmosphere and the fancy art. And most of the time the portions are small and the prices are high or very high. So you pay a large bill and you leave hungry.  Taco Guild is one of thoses places. For ladies who lunch it may be perfect for a small business lunch fine. But if your  working class lot and are looking for a lunch or dinner. I don't think taco guild will satisfiy your hunger and your wallet will be empty at the same time",

Most appetizers are delish...I prefer my guacamole without onion & its very good.  The only reason I can't give more stars is cuz, as a lover of more traditional mexican food...never been a fan of the tacos. There is something to be said for simplicity when it comes to food. The fix is so easy - no one could even imagine. And the parking at times is difficult. So if I can ever get a really good Taco here...that is orderable consistently - not just for happy hour - that would be nice. I know not much can do about the parking. It is what it is. I hate to valet my vehicle & refuse to do it. I prefer Sundays ...the DJ & special events just don't go with vibe so I don't do friday or Saturday here.",

I don't know if this is always the case, but the food seemed to  come out really quick. They weren't empty, but there weren't people waiting to be seated. The shrimp didn't taste or smell fresh, the mahi mahi was okay I guess, the chicken was just okay. The corn was cooked too much and not good at all. Service was good, but it felt like they were forced to help (facial expressions and body language from hostess and server). Having had Sharkey's Mexican Grille last night, Sharkey's was MUCH better...and it's fast food. Can't recommend this place.",

My girlfriend found the Guild on yelp (yes, I love her more for it) and we were determined to see what the old chapel had to offer. The salsas were each perfect in their color, freshness, picante and pairing with fresh chips. The trio of tacos was delectable: Duck; pork and coffee braised beef - each one more delicious than the previous. We washed it down with two of their custom cocktails and who'd have thought a champagne float on top of grapefruit and vodka could be so tasty. We'll definitely be back and the Guild is not to be missed.",

    "text": "This is a unique restaurant, set in an old church. They have some interesting tacos on the menu, including duck and lamb tacos with various toppings. My favorite was the chipotle cherry steak. You get your food quickly. As a group we ordered about 10 tacos, and everyone's food came out within a few minutes!   The pricing is what brings down the rating here. Their tacos are good, but not worth $5 each. Even their beers like PBR are overpriced. With so many options in the area, that is enough to keep me from returning unless it is for a special occasion. In fact, the last time I came here was for a graduation dinner three years ago.",

They did not skimp on the sauce.  The corn tortilla was exactly right and did not fall apart. I had the seasonal veggies as a side, and I loved them.  Grilled veggies are my favorite.    Cons: We also had the Guild Duo appetizer - guacamole and quesso.  That was a little disappointing for the price. But the chips tasted fresh! Also - parking was tough, ended up in the neighborhood behind the restaurant.  I'm looking forward to coming back and trying more things on their menu!  Next time, it will be a happy hour. :-)",

So I finally called the manager and said he's having a bad day and I told him I work with customer service and that's unacceptable. Long story short we got another server and  was great felt the warmth. Other than that horrible experience I always go back for the frozen margaritas and the salad!

One lady ordered a lamb taco and said it was delicious.  Might try that if I go back.  The restaurant is a former Methodist church, so it's pretty neat inside.  The stained glass windows remain.  The bar is where the alter was.  The service was good.  The real negative is parking sucks!

I rushed to order the fastest, easiest items on the menu to have my friends eat before taking off to New York; needless to say, we all eat tacos! While we were eating, many other people arrived and they were served what they ordered without rushing them; their last costumer arrived approximately about 10:30 and were served.

Set in an old church, this restaurant has a fun and funky vibe with unique tacos and flights of tequila. We tried two trios of tacos so we could sample them. All of them were very good but the cherry chipotle steak was our favorite. We got a sampler of salsas with chips as we sat down and our waiter was attentive and made good recommendations. We are going back soon and it was worth fighting the traffic into Phoenix. The beautiful stained glass windows, the paintings, and the huge chandelier are worth the visit. They've kept some of the Church memorabilia on the walls. Definitely a must see when in town.",

I like the chips and salsa your get, they have one mild and 3 spicy salsas. Most places just have one or two and they're never spicy. I got three tacos and the rice, al pastor, adobada, and duck. The duck was amazing, the other two were good but nothing unheard of. Get the corn, it's really good!",

    "text": "Honestly, the only things worth noting here are the building itself and the starter - chips and salsa! We devoured two bowls. I didn't care for the other three, but the main \"medium spicy\" salsa was borderline addicting.   I wish I had heeded the warnings of other yelpers, as I did find nearly everything we ordered to be bland (and dry!). We ordered the al pastor, Yucatan shrimp, and braised beef tacos. None were memorable or even warranted a second bite, but we finished them because we hate to waste food. The chicken enchiladas look absolutely heavenly in photos, but tasted like something you could buy in the freezer aisle. The rice was so colorful, but could've passed for plain white rice in flavor. The street corn was probably the only thing we ordered that I actually enjoyed.   I came to this restaurant knowing it wasn't going to be authentic Mexican food, but Mexican INSPIRED food. Still left disappointed. They have a great concept, but completely missed the mark.",

I loved the large basket of chips with a nice selection of four salsas. I enjoyed their signature corn and three tacos (al pastor, braised beef, and their fish taco). All were good but their fish taco was the stand out. My friend had a burrito, beef I believe and was satisfied. I don't think he loved it but liked it. Good overall visit and will come again.",

Not much to say about the chicken taco either.  The service here was very pleasant and the venue was in an interesting converted church; hence, the second star.  Go here for the atmosphere, definitely not the food!",

No apologies after we sat and waited another year for you to bring us some waters after I went up to the bar and asked for them because the orange salsa was hot as shit.

Housed in an old church, they have retained the stained glass windows, but pretty much renovated everything else into a spacious restaurant with some cool painted murals on the walls. We were there on Cinco De Mayo for happy hour. Really not a very good one. One dollar off overpriced craft beers, although they have a decent selection of local taps. Normally $6.95 for a pint, so still $5.95 during happy hour? Only happy hour food option was the taco of the day for $2.50. Not bad, but you have to settle for whatever it is. That day it was carne asada. Meat was tasty, but kind of dry. Overall, the tacos were just so so. The complimentary chips were good and came with a variety of different sauces and they readily brought more chips if needed. We also tried the special margaritas they had come up with for Cinco De Mayo. At $5.95 for happy hour a pretty good deal, but maybe not $12 regularly. We did not try any entres, which seemed reasonably priced, but not sure of portion size. Certainly worth a visit, but if you like a few drinks with your meal, be prepared for a hefty tab.",

What is exceptional here is the atmosphere, the interior design and the concept.  Let's start with the good. The huge stained glass windows and the giant spherical wrought iron chandelier give this place killer ambiance. The huge open space doesn't lend itself to intimacy, but it's a great place to bring a group for drinks and a conversation.  There is one fatal flaw, and that is a common flaw with places like this: the food doesn't live up to the decor. Gourmet tacos are a great concept, but if you're going to put gourmet prices on your gourmet concept tacos, they better blow me away. I tried every gourmet taco on the menu, and none of them were memorable, or worth $5.  Good thing for Taco Guild that there isn't an actual Taco Guild. Because their tacos probably wouldn't make the cut.",

When the taco came it was literally a tortilla with 4 shrimp in it. It looked very sad. I had to track down another server and ask for some plain cabbage to add to my sad looking taco. After 10 Minutes that was finally delivered and I ate my okay tasting cold taco. Overall a little disappointed in the lack of care for a customers request.",

The space is really cool and unique, I'll give them that. The food, however, was subpar. The guacamole was OK and the queso dip was fine. We each ordered 3 different flavored tacos and agreed that across the board the meat in all of them was dry and they all were missing something -- acidity or more sauce or something.  The service, too, was lacking. There were only a handful of us in the restaurant and yet it seemed to to ages to get our food. Also we kept having to ask for refills on our water.

The staff is friendly and very helpful. They seem to always make sure that the kitchen knows about my gluten allergy, because I have never had problems after my visits. That's not a given, I have experienced the opposite elsewhere.  An additional plus, nobody ever rushes you with the check.

Food: Got their special taco of the day which was buffalo chicken. Wasn't bad but wasn't great either. Their lamb taco was great but not worth the price ($5).  Service: Our server was good and checked up on us regularly.  Parking: When it said private lot, I was imagining a lot for Taco Guild customers but it's a small shared lot with veryyyy few spots. Luckily valet is free.  Overall it wasn't very memorable. I could have seen myself coming here more often if it was so overpriced. $5 for a mediocre street taco?? No thanks.",

It's kind of funny it took us trying one of their tacos at the Taco Festival this year to actually go to their restaurant. The restaurant is beautiful too! So unique. I love that they kept the Church close to its original form with the original wooden ceiling beams, stained glass windows and the old hand-crafted pews. You definitely catch a vibe when you walk in.  That night we tried a few different things. First we started with their Fundido - melted menonita cheese, longaniza sausage, roasted jalapeno mushrooms, caramelized onion, epazote, house-made tortillas. It was perfectly melty with a tiny bit of spice. And for our cocktails we ordered the Forbidden Fruit Blanco  Tequila, Blood Orange, Apple, Lime, Ginger, Mint and the Sinner or Saint Blanco Tequila, Velvet Falernum, Lime, Blueberry, Rosemary. Both were perfectly hand crafted and not too strong. As for the tacos, I tried 3 different ones. First the CHIPOTLE CHERRY STEAK poblano straws, chile aioli, Bleu cheese. This is an absolute must for me! I think next time I'm getting 3 of these they are just so perfect. I could eat an entire bowl of the Cherry Steak alone. Second the URBAN BEAN COFFEE BRAISED BEEF caramelized onion, mango jicama relish, Cotija cheese. And lastly the PORK ADOVADA mango jicama relish, avocado, cilantro. Let me just tell you... these people know how to make a taco with complimenting flavors. I wish we could have had desert but we were so stuffed we could hardly get up to make our way out. I can't wait to come back and try more. Although... like I said, I will be back to have more of those Chipotle Cherry Steak tacos for sure!",

They're homemade, fluffy, tender and perfect accompaniment to the taco fillings.  They held strong and none of my taco fell out of the tortillas.",

The service is prompt but blunt, which I would argue is part of the bucolic feel. I mean the waitresses honesty about what she prefers is symbolic of the church. She was able to guide us on what to expect with each taco. Her perspective was refreshing on which sides, appetizers, and tacos to get. Everything you've ever thought about a street taco has been upscaled, hipsterized, and made in almost a satirical way of deliciousness. The street corn is a must, the avocado fries are better than expected, and the lobster taco is phenomenal. The only bad thing I have to say about the wonderful experience is I wish they did not have a jukebox... it was weird and took away from the natural ambience. Very strange to see an ugly Jukebox in such a perfect place. The bar looked amazing though! Anyway, every time a family member comes in to town I suggest we go here and we do. It is like Americanized Mexican food or what I call True Phoenix indulgence. It is a must.  A Must!!!",

It wasn't reprehensible but it definitely was not on the same caliber of the food.  Service was timed decently but both the server and the manager/supervisor who brought our plate seemed annoyed and didn't make me feel welcome. They did check on us quite a bit but due to their demeanor I would've preferred to have been left alone here.  The tacos were amazing, the presentation was instagram-worthy. The place inside of an old mission, and they've got stained glass windows inside, it really has to be appreciated in real life. Tad expensive but nothing insane.",

We will definitely be returning to Taco Guild.  We will be making reservations ahead though because the wait can jump up to an hour and a half easily on a Friday or Saturday night.

Go early if you want to have a private chat otherwise after 7-8 it looks like a tapas bar. Every table was taken by the time we left.  Just do people don't think that I am writing lots of positive reviews suddenly -- everything we ate during our trip to Phoenix was amazing.   If had to nit pick, I think Taco Guild could have a better tree leches. The cake needs to be soaked through and there should be whipped cream. We have some leche and the cake was delicious but dry. Still we finished it so like I said I am just nit picking here.",

The staff was very welcoming and attentive which made it even more enjoyable. This is why I'm giving it a 5. I ordered the street corn shaved which was perfect! I also had shrimp tacos which were full of flavor.  The one item I wasn't to fond of was the rice. It was a bit dry and felt like it was made out of a box. So I give the rice a 1    It is a spot I would recommend over all!",

I have friends who get all religious about their love for a good taco.   We walked in and were immediately greeted.   The place seemed happening and kinda funky.   The waiter was cool and helped us navigate with some good suggestions.   The Taco's were great!   I got the Al Pastor Pork, Yucatan Shrimp and the Peking duck.   They were all excellent.   My wife let me try the Chipotle cherry steak and I think next time I come back Ill just order three of those.   Wow, really good.   They bring out a huge bowl of chips and different types of salsas (I recommend the Habanero salsa, its killer).   The service is top notch and the place is pretty clean.   The tacos weren't the best I've ever had, but plenty good enough to come back and eat here again.    Can I get an Amen!   Nicely done Taco Guild!",

We probably visit 4-5 times per year!  I give only 4 stars because the service has been sporadic.  Servers and bussers have been moderately attentive, others just vanish for long periods of time. This creates a problem because the tables are a bit small for all the great food and drinks on the table!  With that said, Stephanie served us this past Sunday and she was outstanding...easily the best server we've experienced at Taco Guild.  We will probably be back sooner than normal due to her outstanding service.",

I had the worst experience I've ever had at ANY restaurant in my entire life, while trying to celebrate Father's Day with my family today. The manager Sean Snelling tried to send our waitress home for the day as punishment because he didn't like the way she explained the new menu to us. (She said the menu was getting mixed reviews). After getting reamed by this absurd manager she came to our table with tears in her eyes to say we'd be served by a different waiter. We asked what happened and she told us. We asked to speak with Sean. He came to our table, arms crossed,  with a smug look on his face. We told him the waitress comments weren't offensive at all and asked if she could still be our server. I couldn't help but interject that I couldn't believe he'd send her home because of her comment. His response \" I cant believe I'm having THIS conversation \" WHAT THE HELL SEAN!? Verbal abuse to staff and customers,  isn't a winning combo. He expedited the food in the kitchen for the remainder of our lunch....which was CLEARLY why it took an hour for our food to leave the kitchen. Terrible, check your ego Sean.",

Seriously, I look forward to the one day per week I've limited myself to going (after having gone twice in my first week and realizing the dangerousness of the deliciousness) for the whole preceding week. I'd highly recommend you get the Cartel Coffee Beef Taco (significantly better than its predecessor Urban Bean Beef Taco, sorry, but it's objectively True) as well as the Molido Lamb Taco. Both are phenomenal. The array of salsas, namely the house salsa and the orange salsa (whatever it is) included for free with a basket of freshly made chips is just icing on the saucy, spicy cake. Don't forget to miss the happy hour and Taco Tuesday specials too - big ass $6 margs shouldn't be neglected, though I'd advise you pass on any of the Taco Tuesday taco specials (they're not nearly as good as their regular menu tacos, though they'll get the job of filling you up done for cheap). The waitstaff and bartenders are yet another reason to frequent the place as much as I do as well: Gabe with his expert service, attentiveness (never letting water glasses dip below halfway when his patrons are conquering the salsas especially*******), and friendliness; Harren, who you should feel free to ask questions about the area (he indulged me while I barraged him when I first arrived); and Sunny who also has excellent service. GO TO THIS RESTAURANT IT'S CONSISTENTLY MY FAVORITE IN PHOENIX.",

    "text": "Worst service ever. I sat at my table for 10 minutes and no waiters had approached me to offer anything. Two caucasian guys come in and sit at the table next to me. They get service within two minutes. A waiter takes their drink order and brings them chip and salsa. I try to get his attention but am unable to. So I flag down the host and he talks to some other waiter. That waiter finally comes over and takes my order. Then I am sitting for another 5 minutes. And another group of caucasian men are seated at table near me and a waiter comes up to them and takes their drink order and brings them chips and salsa. Mind you I have been there for 15 minutes and still no water and chips and salsa. Frustrated I go up to the bar and tell them I still haven't gotten water or anything and that I would prefer to sit at bar to get service. My waiter makes up a BS excuse about why he hasn't brought water out. I sit at bar and have my tacos. They offered $5.00 off. I thought that was not much and didn't leave a tip. Still wondering if you have to be a white male to get good service here. It may have not been about race but it is interesting that the two tables next to me with white males got service right away. I won't be coming back to this place ever. I like being treated fairly with the same level of attentiveness.",

    "text": "Although the tacos here might pass in the middle of the country, given the number of delicious, authentic tacos you can find in the Valley for under $2, I have a hard time understanding why anyone would muscle through the tacos here.  Although the combinations sound trendy, they taste like an expired fad - something you'll regret when you look back on them.  Here, you need only wait a bite or two before that regret sets in.  On our first and only trip here, we had the guacamole, lamb taco, pork adovada taco, and Thai snapper taco.  Although you can choose to flavor your guacamole with tastes like jalapeno bacon and pineapple mint, we opted for the house version since it was our first time.  The guacamole, although a sizable portion, was completely lacking in flavor.  There was no hint of cilantro, jalapeno, or lime in any of the bites we tried.  A True waste of delicious avocado.  In each of the tacos, the flavors weren't well developed and didn't marry well.  Blue cheese and curry sauce might sound like interesting toppings for a \"gourmet\" taco, but if you can't pull it off, you shouldn't try.  Even the pork adovada was completely nondescript and lackluster, even despite the attempt to spruce it up with mango jicama relish and cotija cheese.  The side of \"street corn\" that accompanied the tacos was abysmal and tasted little better than canned corn drowning in butter.    This place might be good for drinks since the converted church is a nice change in your average scenery, with high ceilings, lots of wrought iron, and stained glass, but we would not come back here for food if it was free.",

I have yet to try the burritos but I have seen them and they look spectacular. They have a touchtunes system so that you can throw on whatever music is available. The church that this restaurant was constructed in is very nice and well maintained, they have even kept the churches stained glass windows! The bar is very inviting and Eric the bartender is very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and of course any drink you can think of. Just an absolute joy to be here, I would recommend it to anybody who enjoys Mexican food. Don't pass this place up!",

I had to track her down to pay for our bill. The server forgot other items we requested as well.  Ironically we received a survey ticket with our bill and the survey website states that they are no longer taking surveys.   The food was good.

I was excited to have an opportunity to eat lunch here as I am usually serving lunch myself.  We showed up after 12:30 and it was still a little busy.  We waited about 10 minutes for a table as I didn't feel like eating lunch at the bar, bad choice.  After 2 different people brought us water and chips our waitress finally made an appearance.  I had the taco plate with a free side and he had a steak burrito with a free side.  My meal came out pretty quick however his meal came out 7 minutes later.  My free side turned out to be ice cold rice and his free side never arrived.  It's not really a free side if you don't bring the said side.  Our food delivery and drink refills were done by other servers.  At no point did our waitress or any other server ask how our meal was or if we needed anything, isn't that server 101?!? Check on your tables.  My boyfriend had to leave and get back to work as it was taking a long time and could not foresee when our server would reappear.  When she finally decided to check on me and brought the bill she apologized for the confusion?  What confusion?!  She told us she would be our server so I expect she will be serving us, not everyone else.  She just flat out IGNORED us!  When she knew I was not pleased she got short with me.  Probably not how you should treat a displeased customer.    Whitney, dear this business is not for you and stop putting blame elsewhere.    I'm not sure I will be back for lunch.  Maybe when it cools off the patio would be a nice experience.  And the food, pretty good but not worth the bad service.  Also, the manager should be managing his staff not tending the bar at lunch time.",

The place has a good happy hour along with weekend brunch and breakfast burritos/tacos. Good selection of tequilas as well. The food was delicious and portions were very well sized for the price. I got three different tacos and each one was an explosion of flavor from the pork adobada, guild chicken, and Peking duck. Breakfast burrito is massive too. And of course, complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa is very flavorful and rich. Not watery or boring like most Mexican places. Service was a bit slow to start with a waiter coming over but they were a bit busy for Sunday brunch time. No wait to get seated and food came out pretty quickly. They totally missed an opportunity to put their drink and tequila lost menu in a bible though.",

My boyfriend and I went on a Monday for happy hour after work. I ordered a house margarita on the rocks and he had a Cartel Double IPA. Both fantastic!   We were given a plate of chips and salsa that came with four different types to try. If you're a salsa junkie, make sure to ask for your complimentary basket. Their spicy red pepper sauce was my favorite.   For our meal we ordered three tacos: the ono, the shrimp, and the al pastor. For our sides we got a house salad and street corn. The street corn made us both say hallelujah. It was the best part of the entire meal.   We both agreed that we would be back with a large group of friends. What a fantastic place!",

I wish there had been more of the orange and green spicy salsas. The pineapple guacamole was great too. The chipotle cherry steak taco was delicious and I would definitely order it again. The Yucatan shrimp taco was just okay. I ate that one second thinking I would like it better. Someone I was with asked the waitress to pick two tacos and surprise her. She never did come back to say which two she chose. I ordered the street corn but that never came which was fine since I had loaded up on chips before my tacos. We had to ask that be removed from the bill.   Lastly, parking could be better. But I would definitely go back, especially to try some of their tequila and other new and old world tacos.",

Unfortunately the service was abysmal.   We had a young, blond, male waiter who was constantly forgetting to bring things our group had either ordered or asked for. Several in our party ordered the special \"all you can eat\" taco deal which serves approximately two tacos at once and then requires you to order another two each time you're ready for a \"refill\". Our waiter repeatedly forgot to bring several of the people in our party their taco refills. I ordered a kale salad (which was delicious) so I didn't have this problem personally, but it was annoying to witness nonetheless.   I loved my salad. Would have loved not to have to ask for water twice, a drink refill twice, and a \"to go\" box twice when I was ready to leave! I may give this place another shot but only in a party of two or less. I won't go with a big group again.",

The array of tacos, fresh corn tortillas, and the corn is the best \"mexican street corn\" I have had for a long time in Phoenix!  The chipotle butter sauce was so good on the corn and the corn wasn't a KFC-caliber, marinated and sitting all day type!  I even have to say that their types of salsa were great to try with fresh chips.  There were 4 types that had me wishing I had more!  I also am Irish and German and their selection of micro brews had me happy with me trying a few with my tacos.  I like their 3 taco deal and added a side of corn.  It hit the spot and really didn't damage my wallet either.  My wife's margarita was above average too (but not the best in PHX)!  The reason for 4 1/2 stars was the service.  The food comes out fast, but I wish the server was more punctual at refills and the check.  I think the server could have done better with recommending drinks for each type of taco.  But it wasn't like it was horrible service (hostess was awesome and friendly), but 5 stars, the service needs to be perfect!",

Our service wasn't great, we had a coupon which had no limits on it but both our server and the manager refused to honor it. This was particularly frustrating, since we had come because of the coupon. Also there's something about eating an old church that either creeps me out or bums me out (im not sure).

The server said you could get the corn side for $1.50 when you ordered 3 tacos, but guess it didn't count on the happy hour tacos (which he clarified after the fact - when the bill came) Had to order 3 tacos off regular menu to get that price, so we ended up with 9, plus the 3 coffee bean braised beef..

    "text": "(Review includes update)  My daughter and I arrived on a Friday night and were seated after about a 10-minute wait.  Hostess was friendly.  The place was quite busy but staffing seemed adequate.  We knew something was wrong when the hostess who seated us said, \"I'll have someone wait on you as soon as possible.\" I've never heard that before.  After two minutes of not even being acknowledged, i.e., \"I'll be right with you,\" we continued to be treated as if we were invisible.  My back was turned but three servers made eye contact with my daughter and they also had time to converse amongst themselves - yet NONE said a word to us. I started the stopwatch and said if no one comes to us in three minutes, we walk. After three and a-half minutes, we got up and left.  What a shame. The menu looked interesting and the ambience was pretty cool.  But the lack of service was the worst I've experienced in a long time. Will never go back.  UPDATE I commend management for responding to my complaint and they have invited us back to try Taco Guild again. I have adjusted to three stars and will update the rating again based on our next experience.  Their manager was embarrassed by the service we received and thoroughly apologized. That's quite honorable.",

    "text": "I'd driven by Taco Guild before it was open and I was eager to finally try it today. I was excited about the concept and couldn't wait to try the food.  I arrived for lunch shortly after noon with a colleague. I realize places can be busy around lunch, but most are accommodating to working professionals on a lunch hour and are staffed appropriately. There seemed to be plenty of open tables, but we (party of 2) were told the wait would be 15-20 minutes. When I asked why, I was told it was because the kitchen was backed up. Ok, fine... but I asked to be seated so we could at least order drinks. That was not an option and the hostesses were less than polite about it.  After waiting 15 minutes, I asked about how much longer. The hostess informed me it would be at least another 10 minutes. My colleague and I were hungry and becoming a little impatient, but we waited. We then noticed another party of 2 (who came in after us and were below us on the list) get seated before we did. It was nearly 30 minutes before we were finally seated - and outside at that! I realize we're in Phoenix and patio dining is an option, but we were not looking to sit outdoors as neither of us were dressed appropriately and there were seemingly plenty of options available inside. Hungry, crunched for time and annoyed we took the patio seating.  Our server was GREAT! She quickly brought out chips and salsa - which were very tasty. She also explained the menu and seemed very knowledgeable. Because of the wait we were immediately ready to order. Sadly, they were out of a few things we wished to try. Beef and pork. How can a place known for tacos be out of beef and pork during a lunch rush?!  The food arrived - we both had tacos - and it was surprisingly delicious. We both enjoyed the Guild Chicken tacos and the corn appetizer.  We also noticed the randomness of the music. They have a juke box type thing and it does nothing for the atmosphere. It went from like hip-hop to country to EDM. Totally random and ruins the vibe of the place.  The friendliness and the first impression from the hostesses left a bad taste in my mouth. The food and service from our server slightly made up for it, but it remains to be seen if I'll return.",

    "text": "So...here's the scoop: Host asked what we wanted when we walked in the door (to eat, both of us, please?) He seated us at our choice if tables, and seemed surprised that we were OK with a \"community table\"...there were a dozen other people there at the time. A server brought waters, then told us the other guy would be our server. The other guy stopped by about 5 minutes later, and asked if the previous server had taken our drink or app orders, and seemed annoyed that A) she had not, and B) we hadn't decided yet. When he brought our drinks back he didn't get the order right, and seemed bothered that we wanted it right. When we asked for HIS recommendation for what he liked, he said it was all good and he didn't have a favorite.  When Jen asked for hers without cilantro, he asked if it was a preference or an allergy (it's an allergy). Our appetizer came out quickly, followed too quickly by dinner. We had: roasted corn on the corn appetizer, four tacos (al Pastor, Lamb, snapper, and braised beef). The food was DELICIOUS, the place was architecturally noteworthy, and the service was as bad as I can remember, and we eat out way too much. Maybe it was an off-night for our guy. I hope so, because I could be convinced to go back!!",

    "text": "Dined last night 1/28/14  First, let me say that  the food at Taco Guild is (mostly) awesome. The salsa is too runny, though, and I judge a lot about  Mexican food experience on the quality of the salsa. I had the grilled romaine salad and a side of corn-off-the-cob that was delicious, and their draught beer selection from local breweries is solid.   HOWEVER, the service is so horrendous that it nearly neutralizes all of the positives of the cuisine. First, our waitress brought me the wrong wine. Instead of allowing the table to keep the accidental glass, from which I had already drunk, she said that she had to take it back from me, or charge me for it. Really?? You'd rather waste a perfectly good glass of wine  than just let us consume it? I surely hope you weren't going to pour it back into the bottle for reuse!!  Secondly, one of the members of our table did not receive his drink, and upon waiting  fifteen minutes for it to arrive, instead of admitting she forgot, the waitress told us it was because the drinks are handmade, thus taking a long time. Said drink arrived three minutes later. Then he did not receive his soup, then he only received a single a-la-carte taco rather than the full plate that he ordered. Then he received the wrong side dish with the plate. It was absurd.   Third, after mentioning to one of the owners (who I am told also partially owns z tejas) that we didn't care for the jukebox (the general public seems to have an affinity for mediocre 90s alt rock), his reply was, \"Okay. Pretend it isn't there.\" What a rude, smug, jerk.   I'll be going elsewhere for my Mexican food. I'd rather not wait 15 minutes for the wrong class of wine, while being forced to listen to the Gin Blossoms.",

The murals and stained glass windows with dim lighting gave it an authentic feel. They give you 4 different salsa dips to try with tortilla chips, which we all loved. The tacos were filling and a great choice (shrimp, fish, and beef) The corn was definitely one of my favorites and was cooked perfectly and spicy but not overwhelming. The queso dip was excellent and I honestly have never had better. We also had spicy meatballs that were good, but to spicy for me but my friends loved them. The happy hour menu was quite small with very little appeal to us, therefore we won't be coming for Happy Hour. Over all we were pleased.",

But they have really fun, fancy, creative and tasty tacos and the margaritas are great. They have a three-taco special where you get a free side, but I ordered a Sonoran hot dog taco and you can't get a taco of the day and also get the special. The entire restaurant is in a former church, which is neat, but you really do need to sit outside unless you want to scream over the too-loud music. Also, there's a lot of parking but it's hard to find a spot.",

I liked the guacamole a lot but the cheese was just okay to me. I'd probably opt for something different in the future. We had the Mexican street corn as well, which was super delicious.

    "text": "ORDER THE CHERRY TOMATO BEEF TACOS.  EAT. REPEAT. LEAVE. TRAVEL OVER 800 MILES TO COME BACK AGAIN. THANK ME LATER.  We first discovered Taco Guild on a whim, during a roadtrip from the bay area down to Phoenix and we were craving good food- TG (as we affectionately refer to this place) popped up on Yelp and we came only to discover the AWESOME church structure it is located within... adds so much fun to the already incredible flavor of this place. Ambiance is a huge PLUS in our books.  We were just in Phoenix again this past December and had to stop by again. Always have a good time here- albeit this time we were trying to sit at the high tables and were told by the front desk lady that we couldn't push two of them together that were just 3 feet apart and would not have gotten in anybody's way... and her response was, \"we just don't let people push tables together, that's policy\" and we saw another group push other tables together shortly after. A bit condescending and perhaps discriminatory but we let it go since we absolutely love Taco Guild. We then were sat by the manager and she confirmed that there was no existing policy for making it illegal to push two tables together and apologized to make our experience much better (mistakes CAN be fixed and rectification makes things better).   Anyways, we ordered the usual which consists of the Cherry Steak Tacos (much better than the coffee version imho) and the street corn as a side (a must). We usually get a variety of the other tacos also just to remind ourselves that the Cherry Steak Taco is pretty much the only one you should order because it's the tastiest, but the other people we ate with also really liked the lamb taco and the shrimp one as well. The chips are always a nice touch as a freebie and the sauces that go with it are immensely delicious and I slather it all over my tacos.  Great place and great desserts as well. All in all a fantastic unique spot to have lunch/dinner and I've never left this place unhappy- highly recommend!",

When I order BBQ chicken tacos but I can't taste or see the BBQ sauce, that's a problem for me! We decided to spend our memorial day at Taco Guild.  After reading yelp reviews, we decided to give it a chance.    Yuck.... on the BBQ chicken tacos... lets just say DRRRRYYYYY. The best part was the three different salsa sauces that I duncked my BBQ chicken tacos in.....   Lord help these tacos, please!   The margaritas were the stanard frozen or on the rocks pretty good for $5.00 all day but only for today's day.   Listen I love ambience but I can't eat it... Taco Guild needs to set up there taco game. We live in AZ people..tacos are the staple of Mexican crusine!   Taco Guild missed the mark.....",

We visited around noon on a Saturday and had no problem getting a table (we had a reservation, but definitely didn't need it).  Our waitress was great - very knowledgeable on the menu, paced our meal out, consistently checked back and didn't rush us out when we were wrapping up.   We were able to try a few of their guacamoles - we really enjoyed the pineapple mint & jalapeno bacon varieties and they kept the chips flowing during our entire meal.   We all had various tacos - our personal favorites were the al pastor and the chipotle cherry steak. Also - highly recommend getting the street corn!   There is a parking lot for easy parking while you are visiting as well.",

    "text": "We came to this place after seeing that it was advertised as Phoenix's best taco. We were super intrigued. It was Tuesday, so they had a select Taco Tuesday menu with tacos for $2.75 each. We ordered three carne asada, three blackened shrimp, and one chicken taco. We also ordered street corn on the side.   The street corn was actually the best part of the meal. It was nicely seasoned and tasted good.   The tacos itself were okay. The carne asada meat was dry. They didn't serve any lime with any of their tacos. I would rather go to a hole in the wall taco joint for more authentic tacos. Overall, still good. But I wouldn't say it's the best.",

We all got taco plates, I got the Guild Chicken, chipotle Cherry steak and the cartel coffee beef. The chicken and steak were my favorites. I also got the Street corn and would go back for that alone.  Chips & salsa were delicious as well, everything tasted freshly made.   We went around 2:30 on a Sunday and the parking lot was crazy. It looks like they have free valet for dinner, which would have been great.   Only issue we had was my beef taco was just one big blob of fat. But I brought it to the waitress attention and she got me another with no questions or problems.   We will definitely be back!",

The food- I had the shrimp bacon  taco and it was okay but $5.50 for one small taco is ridiculous. The margarita below average since it tasted like old bitter lime.

    "text": "We were excited to visit this place as we had heard rave reviews. We were so excited to the point where we had considered hosting our wedding reception here (and buying out the restaurant for the night). We had just moved from AZ to FL but were flying back to look at wedding venues but decided that we HAD to stop off at the Taco Guild. After working with the Events Coordinator she told us to come in and sample the menu.  I have to say the concept is pretty great. A taco restaurant inside of an old church! We came in and sat down, advised our server that we were working with Jenny (the event coordinator) and were going to sample some items off the menu. We knew in advance that these were not going to be your traditional tacos but would have unique and exciting flavors.  We ordered 4 tacos from the Old World section. Once we received our tacos we could see the beef tacos were dripping in grease and our tortillas were completely soggy. After letting the grease drain out we tasted the taco and it was just bad. It tasted as if it had been sitting out in a bowl of grease for hours! After trying all of the tacos we came to the consensus that the meat was extremely dry and all tacos that we tried were lacking in flavor! Such a disappointment! Our server seemed to care less about refilling our drinks or checking in with us. The restaruant was practically empty and we practically had to chase him down to give him our money  I dont get what the hype is about this place. I am guessing that its the unique idea of the taco restaurant in a church? We wont be back and will be looking elsewhere to host our wedding reception.",

Came with a small group of 6 for a birthday party.  No reservations between 6-8 (the only time you want to make reservations lol).  No biggie we waited briefly and were seated in the corner by the men's room.  Eh...thanks?  We were brought menus offered drinks all the usual.  The waitress was nice but quiet a a church mouse (get it?) and the place was very loud.  She recommended nachos and tamale app so we did it up.    The craft beer menu was legit.  Definite highlight.    The venue is really dope.  Old church redone into a gastro-pub type feel.  Another highlight.   The nachos were weak.  Nothing stood out and they were pretty plain.  The tamale was outstanding.  The sauce, corn, soft masa, everything about them was right.  Highlight.  I ordered a duck taco, coffee beef, and carnitas.  Also shared some of the chile relleno.    The duck taco was hella dry.  Like hard to swallow dry.  Covered it in salsas and choked it down.  The coffee beef was interesting but also on the dry side.  Not feeling either one of them.  The carnitas was decent.  Moist, some good flavors, and tender.  The sauce on the relleno was amazing.  Not what I'm used to in a chile relleno but the flavors in the sauce would make anything special.  Ordered a michelada and it was mad weak.  No spice, no lime, and it was luke warm.  Poured the ice out of my water into it and choked it down.  Pretty mixed review here.  Relleno sauce amazing, tamales excellent, craft beer menu and venue on point.  The rest really fell flat.  Would I try it again?  Maybe?  Would I recommend? Not at this time.",

Guacamole was nothing special. The beans and corn sides were pretty good. However the tacos we tried all sucked. They were bland, things that were supposed to be crispy were soggy. Nothing special about their tortillas at all. For instance the Korean fried chicken taco -- the chicken had the texture of day-old fried chicken bits that you pulled out of the refrigerator and reheated in the microwave. The ground beef taco could have had flavorless tofu for meat and it wouldnt have tasted any different. Just a \"meh\" experience....Which really sucks because the concept is awesome. The ambiance/atmosphere is super cool. If I ever went back it would be only for happy hour drinks, maybe chips and salsa. No way would I get any of the tacos again...",

There are stained glass windows with paintings and pictures of I'm assuming members of the church. It's a cool thought, but a little odd for me personally.  The food on the other hand was actually very good! The tacos were amazing and the street corn was good. If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, this is NOT the place. But the fusion flavors are pretty good. The only thing I was disappointed with was the grilled serrano peppers guacamole. It was not spicy...at all. It honestly tasted like regular guacamole. Our waiter told us it was spicy, so I was really disappointed when it was not spicy at all. We even asked for jalapenos on the side to try to make it spicy by ourselves. Like most Mexican restaurants, they give you free chips and salsa. They had 3 different types of salsa and they were all yummy! I could have eaten just chips and salsa!   Service was very attentive and helpful. The price was kinda steep for me. I think I spent close to $15 for 3 tacos and street corn. But I'd probably come back just because of the unique tastes.

So there you go.  But it only gets better from this point forward. A sampler of four tasty salsa with \"fresly\" baked oven chips are promptly served. The menu offers plenty of choices for all palates. Beef, chicken, lamb, seafood, vegetables at various heat levels. The staff constant attention to our needs was amazing! We were a big group of 24 friends and we were treated with the best individual attention. Best way for you to judge Taco Guild is to try it. You will be pleasantly surprised and you will want to share it with your friends as l an sharing it with you today! Bravo",

It was a nice sized taco. But the execution was like a child said I want this and this on a taco. Terrible. Taste. Let's just say interesting. Who makes tacos with root beer and fruit. ? It's like they wanted to experiment with tacos. Don't. Tacos are a simple dish not hard to mess it up. But this place managed to do it.   Hostess was friendly and good service. Food meh.

We were seated at a side table, which was nice. The restaurant itself was quite loud and noisy.   We were greeted by our server with a large bowl of chips and four different salsas. Chips were ace and the varied salsas were good...I wasn't thrilled about any one in particular, but was still good for sure. I had the vegetable burrito with a side salad. The salad was yummy with a cilantro dressing. The burrito was probably a 3.5/5. The rice and bean portion was good, but the vegetable part was a bit bland. The corn looked really good. All in all, I really enjoyed the ambiance of the place. Definitely would be a cool place to come back to. They had a small selection of vegetarian options, but better than nothing I suppose!",

We started off in the bar inside and have to say it is beautiful.  It is worth it to go and have a few drinks and just experience the place.   After a drink inside we went outside to wait for our friends.  Unfortunately the tacos were not up to par this time.  We all had different tacos and nobody was impressed.  I had the lamb taco which I had before and remembering loving.  This time there was too much blue cheese on it which masked all the other flavors.  It didn't even have the distinct lamb flavor that lamb is supposed to have.  I was even wondering if it really was lamb!  The other tacos were the shrimp, pork and beef but nobody was impressed with their tacos.  We also had an appetizer which consisted of green humus and guacamole with vegetables and crisp pita like chips.  The guac was all right but the humus was absolutely the worst I have had in any restaurant.  I was told it was hummus, may it wasn't?  Anyway it did not have much of any flavor to it.  They gave us about a quarter of a cup and we didn't even eat half.  Too bad because I love hummus.  Drinks are good here so I would come back for that.  I like that they have a brown ale and a stout because so many places don't carry dark beers and have like 5 IPA's!  I like a good IPA but so many at one place?  Also had some good red wine here too.  Can't complain about the service inside at the bar or outside.  Very attentive & friendly service.  I hope that this was just an off night for them because, like I said, the past 2 times I was impressed with their tacos.",

Boyfriend had the same issue with his food and didn't even finish his it was so bad.  The rice was over cooked and seasoned with not sure what.  and the iced tea tasted like it was brewed with hot tap water.  The one good thing was the queso fundido which was very good and full of flavor and large sliced vegetables.  Oh and the building is amazing.  Will not return to this place though, way better restaurants with actual authentic Mexican food in the area to be satisfied with.",

I really felt that she was absolutely not interested in being there. Honestly if my cousin and I were not in an amazing mood, it would have been a horrible experience. Still, I know servers   have bad days, but the art of serving is to leave your problems at the door, and walk in to work with a smile. And the art of managing a restaurants and servers, is to notice my server is super blah and should be either given a break or sent home to take care of whatever is making her look the way she was. She wasn't rude, she wasn't unresponsive, she was just bland, no smile and sounded like a robot.  - manager (or someone who looked like a manager) did check on us and ask how the food tasted, and I always feel  that's a good touch.  - now the food. We both got tacos, It was good, BUT it was a bit cold. There was some warmth to it, but I'm not sure if by the time it made it to our table it got cold, or if it sat way too long before it was brought to us. I know for a fact it didn't sit on our table for long, because we were both hungry and didn't have drinks, just waters so we jumped right into it. The tacos were chicken, steak, fish and duck and they all really tasted good, but if they were a bit warmer, it would have been AMAZING. Chips and salsa were great too.  - ambiance and location. Parking was somewhat of a nightmare but my review has nothing to do with that, just saying it so if people are gathering to go eat there, they should probably carpool or uber. The location is very good and central and the ambiance is amazing. The building looks like it was an old church or was built that way, and the stain glass windows are beautiful. High ceilings which I love.   Thanks so much for a good (not great) experience and looking forward to coming back for better service and warmer tacos hopefully.",

It was packed when I arrived but luckily I snagged a couple seats at the bar and got a hh margarita. I asked the bartender if there were any sort of specialty margaritas for hh, and she said there weren't but she could add things, or make it spicy. I really appreciated that info. I got the basic margarita but spicy and it was perfect! She was SO on top of service and as I was waiting for my friend I could see her scanning the bar constantly to make sure everyone was taken care of. Wish I had gotten her name, whoever she is she is phenomenal. Once my friend arrived we got the guacamole with bacon, yumm! And after a few margs we got some tacos, which came out quickly and were fantastic. Great vibe, awesome service, and fantastic food. I love this place bc it's consistent. I haven't ever had a bad experience here. It's my go to now for margaritas and tacos!",

    "text": "I thought the food here was fine. I want to start by saying that. It all looked/smelled good, and I would go back to explore if I had friends that really liked the place. For a taco place, they have a good selection of beers.  But, I would also say it's a very hipster place trafficking in food that's \"elevated,\" which I think just means \"more eloquently described and expensive.\" Vegetarians will have the option of two salads, a pepper-and-hummus taco and standard sides (beans, queso and rice, my veggie ppl). If you're there for tacos and down for the meats, there are a few \"new school\" tacos that might pique your interest, but breaking $5 for a street taco is something I just can't get behind, even if they are created by self-initiated taco guildsmen creating flavors \"worthy of the masters.\"  Real talk, I'll probably go for the \"all you can eat tacos\" on Sundays at some point. It's got a good vibe for hanging out, I can eat a lot of tacos, and there's a church altar stocked with booze. But I cannot overlook that this place makes me laugh out loud. It is a parody of itself - the hipster gastropub where an exclusive guild of prodigy taqueros fulfill their destiny of re-inventing the street taco into something more perfect not ere discovered, perfectly situated next to the Starbucks and Buffalo Exchange, across the street from the place where a starry-eyed young man fell back in love with the enchilada by redefining it. (Seriously, you can't make this stuff up. It's like they forgot we turn it into poop.)",

That in itself is worth some conversation. The food is amazing. I had chicken enchiladas and my wife had  shrimp tacos. Both dishes were excellent. The service was just as good as the food and the extremely affordable prices added to a great night out. We will definitely be back. For those who haven't been there you need to go.

    "text": "My husband and I went to dinner at Taco Guild tonight in spite of the rating I had seen on Yelp. To start off, I would recommend going here...  Saying that, I would advise that it is more of an artisanal taco restaurant, not abuelitas mexican cuisine. I ordered an Al Pastor and a Pork Adovada taco in the lettuce wraps. They were both wonderful!!  My husband ordered the chicken taco and a cherry steak/beef taco (I forget what it was called), and neither of them were fabulous.. The chicken was very bland, and neither taco was seasoned quite right and did not have enough meat in them. He tried both of my tacos, and loved them both. We will both stick to al pastor and pork next time we visit.  We both enjoyed the chips and salsa, as well as the chorizo meatballs as an appetizer. Spicey!! But really good :).  The ambiance inside is nice. Bad music choices, (we both like country but not particularly in a historic church over tacos...), but they have put a lot of effort in making the place unique.  We both LOVED our waitress, and felt the service was great. I am rating 5 stars now because I think this place deserves higher than 3.5 stars... Previous reviews tear the service apart but we have to be understanding of new restaurants--they don't get to choose the country's top 50 servers and hire them for their grand opening.   This place offer tacos in butter lettuce wraps...you don't find that often!! And they were so good, my husband (who is no tiny twig) is going to order them my way next time and pass up the corn tortillas.   We will be back, and I'll cross my fingers my hubby gets meatier tacos in subsequent visits. It's worth a shot.",

Situated in an old Methodist Church, this place is beyond unique. The walls are flanked by stained glass windows, the jukebox is inside an original enclave of the church where the service songs would've normally been hanging.  It's very unique.    We opted to start with the guac/chips.  The guac was outstanding and super fresh and we inhaled it.  They also had sides of really good salsa, and some much too hot for me chili sauces.  We each got the '3 tacos and a side' deal.  These are not your average tacos. Think more upscale.  I opted for the lamb which had some delicious crispy sweet potato 'straws'; the coffee braised beef which was rich and delicious, and the cherry chipotle    steak.  All were outstanding and my side of corn was crunchy and sweet.  The only 'eh' was the handmade corn tortillas that I wasn't super loving.  They were a little too doughey for my taste, but they did hold up well to the amount of food in the tacos.   Delicous!",

In a crowded field of Mexican restaurants they stand apart    The restaurant is housed in a repurposed church. They have used parts of the old and augmented the decor with thoughtful new touches.  They built a giant iron candelabra in the building and have papered the ceiling with reproductions of Rembrandt murals.    The food is great.  They take great care to look after the little things.  A perfect example is their chips and salsa.  They bring four different types of fresh salsa to the table and one is the \"chef's choice\".    They seated our group of eight promptly and checked on us throughout the meal.  The manager took special care to ensure that we had a great night.    I would suggest ordering the street corn, fresh guacamole, queso with chilis, and any of the tacos.   Happy hour has awesome deals. Come for a drink and the daily special taco.  The last thing I will mention is price.  The food is affordable.  I have paid more for worse food often.  I will visit again every time that I am in Phoenix.    P.S. Awesome tequilas... Order a flight of three and get a Lyft.",

The ambiance is great and I love the candles, crosses, and all the fun accessories hanging on the walls! Also, I like that they sometimes have live musicians playing in the evening. However, it is a restaurant and the food is mediocre. I have tried the vegetarian and various seafood tacos here and they are okay. I enjoyed the beans and corn more than the tacos. Plus the prices are a bit costly considering the portion size. This restaurant is in my neighborhood, so if I do return it will probably be for happy hour drinks and side dishes.",

We also had margaritas and beer which were also scrumptious. Our server was excellent and the atmosphere was lively and entertaining. Will definitely be back, plus the prices are really good!",

Started with the taco of the day which was a crispy catfish taco. WELL DONE taco guild well done! On to the Al Pastor....yes again a winner! Finally rounded out by the cherry beef something or other taco and this one owns the crown for tacos. Habanero straws, great tender beef, blue cheese.... Hells yes !!!

We have had one fantastic server recently the rest have been sub par. When the manager Justin was here we never had any problems with service. We will still come back here because we love the food just want management to be aware of the change in the level of service.",

    "text": "We have been here twice. Our first experience was so enjoyable we had to come back, and Taco Guild has become a new favorite for us.  We met managers Justin and Garth who were both funny, knowledgable, and hospitable. I appreciated that they both visited the table to check on us, and get to know us.  I asked Justin about the history of the church, and what led it to becoming this restaurant. He really seemed to embrace the history of where this building has been, as well as its present, and where it is going. It was nice to hear that the former congregation has been supportive of the transformation. A lot of local memorabilia has been donated and is on display, including pews for seating. It is very community driven here from the decor to the draft list that is all from Arizona (I liked the Porter). The stained glass windows offer great lighting, and the atmosphere in general is vibrant and fun.  They have so many deals here. Happy hour M-F from 2-7, and 11-6 on the weekend. If you order 3 tacos, you get a side for free. They offer all you can eat tacos (I think on Mondays) DJ on Fridays, live music on Saturdays...  The first time we came was a Friday night, which is a louder, adult setting. Lots of fun. Our second time we brought kids at 5:30 on a Monday which was much more calm and quiet. They don't have a kid's menu, but they made us a chicken and cheese quesadilla, perfect.   Overall the food is flavorful served in good-sized portions at a great price point. The new Ono taco was my favorite with a delicious coconut slaw, and the grilled Romaine salad was filling and tasty with the shrimp.  Taco Guild is definitely worth checking out, and we will definitely be back!",

Beautiful stain glass windows.  Now for the food? I got three different kinds of tacos. Don't remember but I think there were about 8 different ones to choose from. These tacos were what I would call street tacos. I may be wrong with my definition but that is what they reminded my of. Lot of other stuff on menu but only tried the tacos. The ones I had was good. I will definitely return. The service was good and everyone was friendly. Their lunch pricing was very good for the quality and quantity of food.  Now the bad. As with most of the new places it is noisy. Hard to carry on a conservation with the people that are with you. Maybe if you can't talk to your lunch partner you hurry up and eat and leave, making room for the next people??? Anyhow I will return as I like the old church and the food.",

Waited 20 minutes to get seated because the servers were busy which made no sense in a half empty restaurant.  They put us in the back room which was fine except we were sort of forgotten.  A server other than ours handled the other bigger table and we never were offered drink refills. My kids asked for knives and one of the ones she brought had dried food on it. Flies are definitely a problem and  I saw others commented on that. One set of the tortillas my kid had were undercooked but couldn't find a server to assist. Sadly we won't be coming back.",

The restaurant was an old church at one time so it made for a very unique dining experience. Stained glass church windows and a bar that fit very well with one another was very cool.   The service on the other hand was just mediocre at best. My biggest complaint was the server kept forgetting or just plain forgot to bring us what was asked for. Although this didn't make for a great overall experience, I would definitely try it again with the hope that the service next time would be much better.",

I think they are a bit overpriced for what you get and not all that flavorful. I do understand it's not authentic Mexican food. If you stick to the taco of the day, it's much better on the wallet. I do like that you can get a corn, flour, or lettuce cup for the taco. The frozen margarita is tasty and stronger than the on the rocks version.  The Bad- My last visit was with a large group of 15 people that was called several days ahead to reserve on a reverse happy hour Friday night. We had to wait 20 minutes to be seated while we all stood by the door in the way, but our tables looked ready the whole time. We never got refills on our waters at all. It took a long time to get a drink order. And we waited an ENTIRE HOUR to place our food order. After that service was good, but that first hour was awful. I will likely not be coming back.",

It's almost like dining here for the first time on each visit. You have no idea what the al pastor tacos will end up tasting like. The homemade corn tortillas taste like homemade garbage. Pray that the waiter remembers to ask if you would prefer flour tortillas. Hint: you do.  The only bright spot is the Mexican street corn which is probably the unhealthiest thing on their menu.  I am almost embarrassed at how many check-ins I have at the taco guild. I have a theory that the prime location is the  only thing Keeping it in business.  Stay away",

Seriously, great chips.   For food, I always get the tacos. So far I've had almost all of them and have yet to be disappointed.   The atmosphere is good, not great.

Immediately I was drawn in by the architecture and how the place looked.   The waitress came by with our waters and salsa and chips. We were both hungry, so we ordered the ceviche as an appetizer. It was so damn good. Fresh. The chips served with it were warm, and delicious. (I wish I took a picture because it was so, SO good) Then we ordered our tacos. I'm a pescatarian, and he's on the keto diet. So it helped that there were lettuce wraps for his tacos, and veggie friendly ones for me. I ordered the Yucatan shrimp from the New World Tacos and the Grilled Seasonal Vegetable from the Old World Tacos. Once they came, I ate the shrimp one. It tasted kinda sweet, kinda hot but mostly sweet. I wasn't crazy about it. Then I fell in love with the vegetable one. All the flavors were happiness in my mouth. And we ended our meal with Fundido! The aromas were great!  Everything was pretty good, and plus, we heard good things about this place.",

For starters, there is a sign posted stating that staff may not pet dogs on the patio which was great because my dog is extremely shy. However, every single staff attempted to pet my dog. Secondly, my glass was absolutely covered in filth. It looked as if somebody filled it with salsa, poured out the salsa, let the cup dry, and then filled it with ice and water before bring it out. The food was very very underwhelming. The rice and beans lacked any sort of flavor, my taco was cold, the meat was definitely unseasoned, my side of veggies tasted like week old canned veggies, and portions were tiny and overpriced. Truly, the most flavorful things were the chips and salsa. Definitely do not recommend!",

Maybe it's that it's located in a repurposed church with a lot of the interior features intact; the bar is where the former altar would have been located, now backed by an impressive array of Tequila bottles to admire as you decide on your food.  The bartenders and servers are engaging and friendly.    Admittedly, I've only ordered the Street Tacos ( categorized into \"Old World\" and \"New World\" ) on each occasion I've visited and, thus, can't speak to the rest of the menu but I have not had a bad sample yet. The Yucatan Shrimp, Guild Chicken, and Chipotle Cherry Chicken stand out.  Usually there is a Taco of the Day to choose from as well, which varies. The 3 salsas provided with the tacos vary in intensity so you can choose your favorite. The basic salsa served with the chips is also pretty tasty.  The margaritas are tasty, but not really above average; just pretty damned good. I find the frozen version tastes slightly better than my usual \"on the rocks, with salt\" preference.  Taco Guild is a great place to hang out at the bar with a few friends, imbibe your favorite cocktail and enjoy the tacos.  It's earned a place in my regular \"rotation\" of hangouts.  Recommended.",

    "text": "After last night, sadly, we WON'T be coming here again.   We had been here about 6 months ago with family for the first time and all had a great time and really enjoyed the food and service.   Last night...not so much. Really, it was the service that was the worst. And if management is reading this, we dined out on the patio around 7pm, the table nearest the door, and our server was the taller man (not Julian who was taking care of the birthday party and whom we wished was taking care of us). Oh, I also left a note on my 'merchant copy' of the bill so hopefully you saw that too.   I won't go into a whole narrative here, but our experience from the brunette hostess at the front door to the server we had, it either felt like it was too much for some people or they just didn't want to be working last night. Service we received was cold, unfriendly, impersonal, felt rushed or stressed, not an environment I wanted to be in after working a long hard week and wanting to go out and enjoy some good food, drinks and atmosphere and spend my hard-earned money. Plenty of other places we can actually feel welcomed.   The food was okay, but not as I remembered it from last time. I had three tacos: braised beef was really bitter, lamb dry, adovado forgettable. I opted for the side of mexican street corn which was so watery I wondered if I was eating canned corn. Beef enchiladas were dry and in much need of more sauce which I asked the server for more chips and salsa (best thing we had all night) in order to pour the salsa over the enchiladas.   All this time, we kept hearing Julian (I hope I have his name right) get seated new tables and how he greeted them, introduced himself, was polite and friendly and thinking to ourselves, \"Damn, why did we get stuck with this guy?\" He should NOT be a server. He didn't even so much care while he was pouring water or setting things down on the table, spilling and knocking stuff over. It was oddly intense. I couldn't even look him in the face by the end of the meal, just get us out of here!  We were going to ask for another server but my trust level just wasn't there in not having been served our food yet and we didn't want to make it worse.",

Quite frankly, I wasn't expecting it to live up to the hype! Yet, I was blown away. Food is phenomenal, drinks are amazing, service is outstanding, and vibe is great!  The service: From the moment we pulled up to the restaurant, we noticed how great the service was! First, there's complimentary valet! Not only was the valet complimentary, the kid (teenage-ish) was super friendly and polite! We sincerely enjoyed meeting & chatting with him. Once we walked in, our hostess seated us almost immediately and we were able to choose seats without waiting! Our waiter was also very sweet and made great recommendations.  Food: I haven't had good street corn since we left California ..that was until we came here! Holy moly, the street taco trio and  corn is to die for! You are also able to mix and match tacos to your preference.   Ambience: The place used to be a church! It was turned it to a restaurant but they kept most of the decor. The altar is the bar! Being a Catholic, I wasn't sure how I would feel about taking shots in the father's house..but hey , he sees me taking shots everywhere ;) As it used to be a church, it's a bit dark but super cozy. There are stained glass windows and ton of  candles everywhere!  It's such unique and cool place! I HIGHLY recommend!",

I ordered a bunch of things because I couldn't decide after reading the yelp reviews. I got the tostadas, the yucca fries, and a steak taco (the one with the crispy jalapenos and blue cheese. They probably thought I was so fat but I COULD NOT STOP EATING. I devoured the taco in 3 bites because it was so juice and had so many flavors going on! I was able to slow down on the tostada because it is truly loaded with chicken and and beans and salsas that you kind of need a fork rather than your hands. It was amazing. Then I got to the yucca fries and I honestly had to tell myself to stop because I could've eaten the whole plate. The aioli that was on them was amazing and I was so full after. The waitress was very kind and kept my water filled the entire time. I also loved the decor and dim lighting. My only complaint was the parking. It was complimentary valet but I didn't have cash for a tip on me so I didn't want to use it. Fortunately I waited for about 5 minutes in the car and someone pulled out of a spot for me to park myself. I would definitely come back with a group!",

The last, redeeming quality about this spot is that their chips and salsas, dips, and appetizers are good. We only come here for that. The drip trio is satisfying, tasty, and plentiful. The corn is always fun to enjoy.   Come here for appetizers and drinks, get your main course elsewhere is what I'd recommend.",

The hostess was immediately available, and asked if we wanted to sit inside, outside, high top, low... So far so good... And then bam... Screeching halt to the good experience. One of the disgruntled servers rudely stops her from seating us, to gripe at her about a small group that was waiting outside. (Mind you, there are plenty of open tables) He actually took the menus from her, and sent her away to go clean off a table outside!! He was standoffish, and had no idea where to seat us because he interrupted the hostess from doing her job, so he takes us over to a dirty table, so we can stand there awkwardly while he cleans it off, seats us with no menus, and not another word. BAD FORM TACO GUILD.  Our actual server came up, and was apologetic, offered us an appetizer on the house, which was a very nice gesture, and you could tell he was trying to make up for the debacle that we dealt with when we walked in. The meatballs, are interesting, the duck and steak tacos are delicious, but ultimately, the food isn't good enough to cover up the half a** service and the unusual mix of country music and old school hip hop that is playing...",

    "text": "Fantastic!!! ***********  The biggest sales point about Taco Guild is the cool building.  Its everything you've heard about on other reviews.  A wonderful inner city rehab. & preservation of a Church building that has been made into a beautiful restaurant!  The very unique features from the stained glass window and old woodwork with large overhead chandelier are very nice and different than other food places serving traditional az/mexican fare.  Super bar setup with tons of local beers specialized margaritas & a tequila menu to be challenged by only a few!!    The food is great. The price even better with the daily taco 1.99 special each along with the drink specials it's a great meal at a shockingly reasonable priced chow!!  Large selection of specialized taco's  that are made like high end culinary tacos.  They all have unique and wonderful flavors with the combinations.  When was the last time you had a lamb or duck taco's.  They serve 4 types of salsa all hand made in the kitchen that are all very unique and excellent!  We had the Urban Bean Coffee Braised Beef taco.  The Corn on the Cobb was off the hook as Guy would say on TV. Very classed up place too. Justin was the manager and he was super with us as first timers and offered a lot of help and conversation on the menu and tequila's in the guild.  Super friendly staff. The ambiance is top-notch and they have a very nice outside patio that has a cool mist setup too.They have sourced AZ things like beer and raw items from local farmers for their current produce! That alone makes me come back for the tacos all the time Justin has a great management style and I would suggest coming during a happy hour off time when less crowded like a Sunday afternoon!  Can wait to bring my Norwegian family here for this outstanding well priced food and drinks!!!",

The quirky fact that the restaurant used to be a church makes for a beautiful and intimate space, while still pulling off a fun, trendy vibe. Comfortable seating inside and out is the cherry on top.  Service has always been outstanding. The servers are always friendly, going above and beyond to make recommendations, even conversation if they're not too busy.  Could not recommend this place more!

Now on the other hand if you like gastro pubs this place is cool. If you want tacos not great. If you want an adult beverage this is a very good place to hang. Sorry for the low stars. Cool bar.

    "text": "I went to Taco Guild expecting to love the place but unortunately, I was rather disappointed. Expecting a hefty wait at about 7pm on a Saturday, but my buddy & I were seated at a patio table right away. The space itself is excellent; cool concept & well thought out. I ordered a $10 drink of which the name escapes me, and that was tasty enough but really not worth ordering again. Service was attentive & prompt. The requisite chips & salsa were quite good and I liked all the varieties of the trio of homemade hot sauces that were brought to the table too.   Now for the problems: I ordered the taco trio, which includes a side dish. 1 braised beef, 1 al pastor, 1 duck, achiote rice for my side. The braised beef: flavor was fine, but it /literally/ smelled like a barn. It was difficult to reconcile its' decent taste with its' terrible smell. The al pastor: the pork was almost white, with nary a hint of chile or pineapple flavor; almost to the point of being simply a pork taco. It wasn't awful or anything, but it just wasn't anything resembling any al pastor I've ever had. The duck: stringy, dry. If you've had carne seca & know the dried, sinewy texture it has, this is about all I can compare the duck to. Duck is considered a bit of a 'luxurious' food, but this didn't stack up by any means. The achiote rice: the rice tasted like it came from one of those Uncle Ben's 90 second flavored microwave rice packs and was left in for 60 seconds too long. It was dry & gritty & the corn in it was wrinkled & devoid of any moisture. The rice just had that processed sodium bomb texture & taste to it.   I wanted to like Taco Guild, but 4 food items ordered & 4 strike outs don't bode well. Maybe it was just an off night; I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and try it again. If it's bad again, I won't return & won't recommend it.   One more thing: whoever has control of the music in the place needs to be fired, and fired like.right.now. ALL OVER THE PLACE. Bad nineties stuff like Blues Traveler, R&B, classic rock and multiple country music songs on rotation. I'll readily admit that I'm a pretentious music elitist, but I can tolerate most stuff by just tuning it out. Country music, however, just makes me ill. Besides-  country music at an urban, younger crowd taco shop...  Why? How does that even remotely fit in w/ the customer demographic of a place like this? Nobody there wants to hear country crap piped in to this old church building.",

Then ordered 4 tacos - meat lacking flavor.  No bueno!)  Service:  3 (nothing special as other reviews noted.  Had to wait a while for a water refill and they weren't even busy)  Price:  3 (not real value for money at almost $4-5/Taco)  Venue:  5 (cool building, was a church I suppose.  Holy one probably left because food sucked)  The most IMPORTANT question of all?  Would I go again?  NO.    Ironically, a friend of mine went there two days after me and also didn't think anything of the place.",

We asked for the quietest part of the restaurant and the hostess was happy to accommodate.  Chips came with a selection of different fresh salsas - that was a surprise.  All were very tasty.  We had the chicken enchilada and it was very good - not too much cheese like so many places.  Also, ordered the fresh guacamole which was excellent.  Staff were friendly and helpful and the place was hopping.  Wish I could go again - not sure when I'll be back in Phoenix.",

I was cut off in the parking lot by one of the restaurants OWN Valet driver, who was parking a car in a spot that was NOT designated for valet parking area.  I had to end up parking across the street due to lack of parking spots.  Upon entering the restaurant, I asked for a manager. The manager that came to assist me was \"Bo\".  I explained to him what happened, went outside and pointed out the employee, and also let him know it was my first time at restaurant and it was not starting in a good light.  Bo stated he was going to speak with the valet employee.  I went back into the restaurant to join the rest of my party and sat at a table.  The manager NEVER came back to me for a follow up, nor did he apologize for the incident. I will NOT be returning to this restaurant. Not only was the customer service lacking but the food was not worth the aggravation.  The lack of attention to the matter on behalf of management was unprofessional and not the type of restaurant I want to give my money to. BE CAREFUL WHEN TRYING TO PARK YOUR VEHICLE",

My boyfriend ordered the Guild Duo which came with chips and two dips (guacamole and cheese). Sooooo good. The cheese dip was so good you could put it on anything. For tacos, we ordered the al pastor pork, yucatan shrimp and peking duck which we enjoyed. My boyfriend did comment that the pork was a little dry. There are definitely better mexican restaurants in the valley however, Taco Guild scores high as a whole. You can't beat the ambience, the $5 margaritas and the BEAUTIFUL church-turned-resto. We will definitely be back!",

However, I had a bite of my brother's lamb taco which was dynamite, and the cherry something one, which was steak and that one was amazing!

Taco Guild has very interesting and innovative tacos.  I only had two.  The Urban Bean Coffee Braised Beef taco with caramelized onion, mango,  jicama relish, and Cotija cheese was fantastic.  What great flavors.    I also had the Yucatecan Shrimp taco.  Again very good and not too spicy, which is a problem I find at many restaurants.  They bring out chips, which again are good as well as several salsas.  I found the main red salsa to be a bit watery.  I believe the orange salsa may have been a habanero salsa, and there was an avocado salsa I believe.    Nevertheless, with the fantastic atmosphere inside and very friendly waitstaff , I am giving this place 5 stars.  Highly recommended!",

The happy hour is alright, it includes a 5$ marg, discounted beer, and discounted shot of tequila with a beer. Additionally, there is a special on the 'taco of the day' (2$). Pretty slim pickings, but not terrible. We each got a marg and we split a taco ( just to taste it). The frozen margarita was STRONG. It tasted like straight tequila. Some people may like this... I would rather it have more flavor. We had chips and salsa with our drinks. They bring out 4 salsas... one large container of red salsa and 3 small containers of other spicier salsas ( one tomatillo based, one orange sauce that tasted very acidic and maybe was made with habanero?, and a pink looking salsa that was spicy and tasty). 2/3 of the small salsas were good, but so small they were hard to eat. The large red salsa was terrible... it tasted like marinara sauce... yuck. The taco of the day was a pork taco with onions and peppers... Our server couldn't pronounce the name and I don't remember what it was, but it was fairly good. The meat was tender, but it was a little overly oniony. I would consider coming back, but it wouldn't be my first choice in town for tacos.",

Stained glass, funky furniture and art, and  cool dishes! They also have a great private back room that I've used for a company dinner. Worked really well! Fits around 20 people.",

First off their menu is tiny, I felt like I had nothing to choose from and it's extremely over priced for what you get. Also we waited almost a half hour for three tacos and burrito. The food is okay but it wasn't anything to rave about. I remember liking the rice but I did not like their beans at all. I had the three tacos and all were ok but it wasn't anything amazing or that I couldn't get for much cheaper elsewhere. I don't have a lot to say about this place... It's an interesting environment, clean establishment, the service was friendly but the food isn't worth the high price; overall it's not a winner for me.",

We actually found seats at the bar after stalking it for about 10 minutes. The bartenders were great and excited to have new people sit at the bar. I had the 3 different types of taco (al pastor pork, duck, and cherry steak) and my boyfriend had 2 tacos and the street corn. I'm so jealous that I didn't get the street corn! I know for next time I might just get corn. I've been here a bunch of times and can't wait till I can go back!",

    "text": "I love Mexican food. I love architecture. I love tacos. I love creative uses in re-purposing cool old architecture. Taco Guild, you have impressed me when it comes to my aforementioned passions. Could your tacos be a bit more flavorful and offer some spicier options? Yes. Could your use of an old mission as your restaurant contribute to a loud dining experience? I know so.  Nevertheless, one does not simply visit Taco Guild and forget the experience. It is definitely one-of-a-kind. I was stunned by the beauty of the interior; they did an amazing job with the space, even re-using pews as benches along the walls, and incorporating beautiful stained glass. I totally dig the fact that this piece of land was purchased for $30 back in the late 19th century and was used to build this church!  A \"guild\" is the name here to signify that they are expertly passionate about tacos, tequilas, and using farm-fresh ingredients from local farmers in their food whenever possible. There's a righteous amount of fresh-made guacamole options, for about $8. I highly recommend the Grilled Serrano variety to add some smoky pepper love to your guac!  As far as the main attraction, the tacos, let's get real. They're authentic when it comes to size, preparation, and griddling of the corn tortillas. Some people have mentioned, and I agree, that there isn't nearly enough spice or flavor as expected with some of the preparations, but I suppose now that you, dear reader, know this in advance of visiting, that you can ask for extra spice. Tacos can be ordered individually, priced from $3.95 to $4.95, and served on your choice of house-made corn tortillas, flour tortillas, or lettuce cups. If it behooves you, you gotta go for the corn tortillas here.  If you're feeling extra frugal as well as hungry, order yourself the Taco Plate, where you can elect tacos, and earn yourself a free side item. Not into tacos? What's wrong with you? Just kidding, they have build-your-own burritos as well as a small salad menu, but I only saw tacos, sides, and guac orders at every table, so clearly this is why people come here.  Speaking from personal experience, the al pastor pork taco, the molida lamb taco, and the Thai snapper taco were each rad in their own right. I would like the chance to try all of the taco varieties here, with maybe some extra something-something picante! Regardless, the prices are right, the service is good, and the atmosphere is unique and awesome.  Oh, and the tequila selection? HUGE. I didn't have the opportunity to imbibe, but the tequila/margarita list looked impressive!",

As we walk up we were stopped and informed that the restaurant was currently hosting a wedding and that they only had their patio open but unfortunately they had no tables open . I totally understood and began to talk with him He felt terrible that we had traveled so far so he gave us coupons for our next visit and even recommended another restaurant near by . As I was about to leave he calls ius back and introduces us to the manager Garth who was very sorry we drove out so far . He said he would accommodate us and make room for a table on the patio . So we stayed !! And so glad we did . The street corn was delicious as well as the duck tacos . The service was excellent although it was a little hot on the patio . Garth the manager came back to our table and he even took us on a quick tour of the inside . The place was a church and totally beautiful inside . Stained glass windows add such a great vibe inside . He even bought out a sample of the meatballs we said we would order on our trip back . All in all it was a great experience we left stuffed and so happy . Kudos to Garth the chef me the young guy at the door Sorry missed his name ... Great staff Can't wait to go back!!",

The diablo deviled eggs are worth a try for sure. I am not a huge fan of sausage, but they're good & the sausage comes from a local shop across the street.  I wish there was more consistency in the salsa as well. One bowl will be full of flavor and spice and the next could be watered down and taste like nothing but tomatoes. If they could work on that, I'd buy it by the tub and bring it home with me.  There is no kids menu, and everything packs some heat- so unless your kid only wants a cheese crisp, this isn't the place for them.  All in all, worth a stop. Would like to receive better service, or at least have it be more consistent.",

The restaurant used to be a Methodist church, so there are still stained glass windows and the vaulted ceiling has exposed wood which is gorgeous!  I had a blueberry margarita ($6 during happy hour) that was a bit strong for me, so I felt overheated for most of our visit. It had a nice blueberry finish though. The chips, salsa and variety of hot sauces were very tasty. The fundido was a delicious starter, and the tacos served on homemade tortillas (about $5 each) were bomb! I had the Pork Avadado, Guild Chicken, and Mahi Mahi tacos. They were all spectacular, but I have to say the Mahi Mahi tacos were my favorite. I also had a side house salad with creamy cilantro dressing that was superb in flavor. My husband had the Cherry Steak, Guild Chicken, and Mahi Mahi tacos. His favorite were the Mahi Mahi tacos as well. He also had the street corn which he thought had great flavor. We highly recommend Taco Guild, and we will definitely be back again.",

Great food, amazing people, and beautiful setting in the oldest Methodist church still standing in Phoenix. Ivy was our waitress and she was beyond phenomenal, same with Wes, who seated us. Make sure to stop by... you'd be missing out BIG time if you pass this place up and choose somewhere else!",

The beans were over cooked and the rice was bland , I covered it in salsa. Thanks to the enchiladas though I will be back. They were so good , I had the green sauce. The shrimp were large the tortilla was thick and also tasted fresh. I loved everything about those enchiladas.",

    "text": "I went to this central Phoenix restaurant with some friends who had been there before. I was so impressed with the beauty of the ceiling and stained glass. But that's not why I was there. I was hungry!   We all ordered tacos. I wanted to order the fish taco, but my friends warned me that it was served with a \"very small piece\" of fish. So I ordered the guild chicken taco for $4.95. I expected a full size taco at that price. I was so surprised at the size of these tacos when they arrived! They did not look anything like the tacos you see on their web site, or what you would get at any other Mexican restaurant. These tacos are what is commonly called \"street tacos\". Very small and with a small amount of filling. In addition, I ordered a side of vegetables, which also was a very tiny portion. The 1/3 cup vege side contained oily bitter yellow squash, red pepper, and stringy broccoli stems that were inedible. The TG is known for unusual offerings. On the menu there were items such as marinated lamb and 'coffee beef\". My  tiny street taco was flavorful, but after we left, I had to stop at a grocery store to buy a snack. I was so hungry after eating lunch at TG.  So, if you do not mind getting very small portions at a very high price, you might like it. At least go to see the stained glass, and then you can stop off at another restaurant to fill up.",

I went for lunch and deal is 3 tacos (choice of corn tortillas, flour tortilla or lettuce wrap) and a side (rice, beans etc) for $10.50. They have a cool spin on their tacos so you aren't going to be getting the standard - they even have duck.  This is a sit down restaurant setting but I'm sure you can get food to go. You shouldn't though because the ambiance I'm telling you is so cool.  The wait staff were all friendly,  service was excellent, and the food came out really fast. I haven't had good service in a while in this area so I extra appreciated it!  I sat in the regular dining area but the bar area looked really cool so I'd like to check this out next.",

However on our visit today, we were very disappointed in the way the restaurant manager, Sean Snelling, handled our customer service situation. He was rude and defensive to our situation and I am sure delayed our lunch service by at least an hour. We noticed he was the expeditor in the kitchen and thus had control over service. Our meals were mediocre at best, greasy and under seasoned meats for tacos. I am disappointed to have to write this review but hope upper management will look into the restaurant manager's customer service skills.",

It's the perfect venue to nosh on an Arizona favorite and maybe feel the crushing weight of religion to boot.    (Don't bother trying to park yourself.  Spare the couple bucks for a tip and just valet.  It'll get you to the tacos and guilt faster.)",

All of which were so unique in presentation and flavor. Our party was utterly AWESTRUCK by the live performance of Emily and AJ. So much so that we asked to meet them and followed their social media to show support. Beautiful restaurant. Used to be an old Catholic Church so it's got a very vintage chic feel. I am from Cali and this place makes me wish I was a local. We thoroughly and genuinely enjoyed everything and every single minute of our visit. I will make it a point to come here every single time I am in town. Thank you, Taco Guild for the amazing experience.",

And dry. The fish taco. Bland. And overcooked. The carnitas. Soggy. On top of that they are so pricy. $3.95 for a pastor taco. $4.95 for a fish taco. The best part of the meal was the side salad.   The only place that is less Mexican than this is, Gadzooks Mexican down the street. (Never been there but the name, wtf Phoenix). Why not open a Taco shop called Chow Fung's authentic Tacos while you're at it. Smh.   So if you want Mexican food, this ain't it. Not even close. If you want bland overpriced Ingredients in a tortilla, this is the place for you.   Three stars only for the free chips and salsa and good service. Food alone is a two-star.",

    "text": "First off, we have been coming to Taco Guild for quite some time and have visited them over ten times. We have always enjoyed the food. The problem with Taco Guild is that their service is beyond reprehensible.   There is a specific hostess, a woman with short black-hair that we have had problems with. The first time, we were seated by her we had to wait for 15 minutes to be seen and served. The waiter apologized about the mix-up and said that our seat wasn't assigned to him. He was very gracious about this. We shrugged this off as a mistake. The second time, the same hostess walks us past three open tables and sits us in the back-room behind the wall where you can't see the rest of the dining area. Again, we waited for some time for a server. Meanwhile, other groups were sat at the empty tables that we walked past and saw others get their food before us. This was starting to feel purposeful and vindictive. Lastly and most egregiously, we decided to eat there on a Sunday. The SAME hostess sat my family outside, which we requested. Strangely, the waiter that was working the patio did not come and greet us. In fact, we waited 20 minutes and still nothing. We got up and asked this hostess for someone to serve us and she said someone would be right out. Still nothing! After another bit of waiting we get up and leave and tell the hostess and manager what happened. The hostess had the gall to cheerily say \"have a nice day!\" as we left Taco Guild for the last time.   The real kicker and important part for everyone reading this is that my family is mixed-race. We absolutely hate the idea that this was based on how we looked, but happening three times by the same individual, makes us question the integrity of the restaurant.",

    "text": "The meal was amazing! The service was outstanding. We started off the meal with chips and house guac which tastes a step above most places! My fiance is doesn't eat red meat and had the vegetarian and shrimp tacos which were delightful. I had the staples: chicken, carne Asada, and pork. Each one tasted different and unique.  My favorite of them all was the chicken surprising, not because it tasted the best, but because the favors complemented each other well.  We had two beers for the table and didn't touch one of them because of good conversation. When the server came around they asked if we didn't like the beer and we said no, and explained about the conversation. The server insisted he take it off the bill and that was that. Highly recommended for service and food!",

    "text": "Every bite was absolutely delicious!  The interior is gorgeous! At first when my husband and I walked in with our two young children we almost left because it looks so nice inside and we thought maybe it wasn't appropriate for our kiddos. However the entire staff was gracious to our whole family from the very start and made us feel very welcome.  My husband, who is Mexican, and grew up in New Mexico is a hard judge for Mexican food-- loved everything. Especially the queso  fundido  (hope I am spelling that right). He said, \"tastes just like it does back home\". A huge compliment! We both had a three taco platter and the tacos were so expertly crafted, they take you to a different place. The fish taco transported me back to my childhood in San Diego and had a very Baja feel. Then there were several marinated tacos that were so reminiscent of our time spent in the Yucatan peninsula, which is a whole different style of Mexican food that most people have never had.  Then the tequila selection! We are always so disappointed by other restaurant's selections because there are so many really good tequilas out there. We will definately be back sometime soon without the kiddos enjoy  a couple of tequila flights with some more excellent tacos!",

It is an old converted church with neat stained glass windows and dark, rich wood accents everywhere, very spacious and clean.  The food is amazing.  All ingredients locally sourced and fresh, fresh, fresh.  The tacos are unbelievable and the burritos and street corn are also fabulous.  One thing that has set this place apart in my book-the friendliness of the staff.  From the bartenders to the servers and everyone in between.....these folks smile and talk to you and genuinely care about how your experience there is.  Only thing keeping this from being a five-star affair is that it is a just a tad  pricey (not way pricey, just a bit in my opinion), but I also 'get' that at most places, good, quality food is usually worth the extra cost. Taco Guild is definitely a winner.",

I met the bar manager, Darren or something (again, the margs awill make you stupid); but he was very hospitable to my buddy and I.  if you want great food, great service, and just an all around great time, the guild is where its at.

The best part about eating here is they give you an ample serving of chips with four salsas.  I usually get the taco trio.  The Yucatan shrimp taco is the best (I personally did not like their grilled chicken taco whatsoever).  The street corn is good, too  It's kind of cool how they give you a knife to cut off the kernels.    They're very accommodating and on top of their game with service.  I've been here twice in which my dining companions had special requests, and they honored the request without any issues.  I would recommend this for tourists and locals.  It's one of those unique spots that I haven't seen in other cities.  Parking can be a bit tight, but it's worth it.",

I had the Happy Hour Daily Taco which was delicious, delicious, delicious.  Then I had two more and the street corn.  Food was amazing.

    "text": "My wife and I went to Taco Guild for dinner and to hear a friend who was playing there. Taco Guild has both good and not-so-good aspects. So in the spirit of ripping a band-aid off quickly, let's begin the not-so-good.  First, parking is a nightmare. I didn't know that a majority of the parking by the entrance is complimentary valet; not a big deal since it is complimentary until I realized I had no cash for a tip-- the valet was working his behind off and was very nice.  We went inside to put our name on the list and expected a 60-75 minute wait-- the hosts were spot on with the estimation, we were seated about 65 minutes later. The wait was expected and not totally outrageous since it was a Saturday night; however, there was no place to  wait without being in the way of people running food, others trying to enjoy the music, etc. So we kept moving around and around.   Also didn't know that reservations were accepted. While we were standing around there were a few large tables that were half empty because they were reserved. I know, they were reserved, but it still doesn't make customers too excited to wait 60 to 75 minutes with tables half empty. Still not a huge deal since we were listening to the band.  We were seated within the wait-time we were told when we arrived-- so kudos to the hosts! My wife ordered a margarita she said was very good. I had a soft drink and water and my daughter had a soft drink as well.   We started with the Guild Trio which was good. The tortilla chips were hit and miss. Some were fine others tasted like they had been left in the fryer too long and were extremely oily and soft. We also had the Fundido. There aren't many fundido sauces I don't like and the Taco Guild was no exception. The Fundido was good, but it tasted like velveeta queso dip. Which again, I don't have a problem with Velveeta, but when you spend $9 on an appetizer and the chips are suspect, the Fundido should be orgasmic.   The Guild Trio was good and my wife liked the guacamole. I thought the guacamole could have used a bit more garlic or salt and pepper. Now I'm not a guacamole connoisseur so take my opinion for what it is worth.   Then I had the Pork Adovada, Guild Chicken and the Yucatan Shrimp tacos with the Borracho Red Beans. The adovada taco had a nice flavor but was a little dry. The Guild chicken taco also had a nice flavor to it, but the chicken had a weird texture to it which threw me off-- I'm easily put off by foods with weird textures. The Yucatan Shrimp taco was delicious. My wife had the same except she had the taco braised with coffee, I can't remember the name. It was really good. My daughter had a salad which was nothing more than iceberg lettuce with red beans. The Borracho Red Beans tasted like cowboy beans.   Overall the food was good enough that I will definitely try Taco Guild again for different tacos. However, the prices were a little high on some of the menu items.",

    "text": "So my friend and i had come here Saturday night for dinner because a friend told me i \"had to try it\". So we ordered the horchatas, guacamole and shrimp and chicken enchiladas. Let me start by saying the horchata is so different here and very very very small on top of being very different(very thick consistency). Definitely wouldn't recommend to anyone craving the horchata you get anywhere else. Since I'm pregnant I'm very thirsty all the time. With the cup being extra tiny i ordered the aguas fresca thinking it would be in a pint glass by some slight chance. Wrong again!!!! A small baby size glass(and thicker consistency which makes no sense since aguas frescas is like a \"fruit water\" this was almost like a smoothie) each of these costing me 5 dollars per drink mind you almost the price of a whole dish!! I felt bad for any server i get because I'm just so thirsty. I'm sorry! So i then ordered an ice tea and made sure this time to ask if it came in a normal pint glass. I'm sure she was totally peeved with me by this point for ordering so many drinks. I did drink them all but totally regretting everything right now which we will get to.    Onto the food.  The guacamole was probably my favorite thing on the menu next to the Shrimp enchiladas.  The tortillas were like nothing I've ever had before for  an enchilada super thick. Was super impressed with the shrimp and was in heaven and full not touching more than half not including the beans and rice.  I needed a box as well as my friend.  We paid for our tab and were pleased with our experience. Here comes the great part.  Both of us had our stomachs completely done for starting close to 8 hours after eating here so i ran to the toilet and thought something was seriously wrong with my stomach or unborn baby. The whole day my stomach was just not right and is still not right after 72 hours.**update: it's now 5 days still no improvement/after a little over a week my stomach is now back to normal thank god**Both my friend/coworker and i check in on each other to see if each other's stomachs let up. To no luck not much. Constant bubble guts. Sorry for all the TMI but just wanted everyone to be warned while the food is good is it really worth your health being on hold of other delicious food and drinks for days on end? I think not. I can't say I'd feel safe coming back.",

Each taco is big and packed with different toppings and sauce. A burst of flavors with each bite.   Tacos are $4-5 each. A bit pricey but you can get a taco plate that comes with 3 tacos of choice and a free side.   Chips & salsa - complimentary as you wait for your food. Comes with 4 sauces - salsa, habanero (good), verde (good, has a hint of jalapeno) and a spicy red.   Elote - good! Option to order it on the cob or off. I recommend off so it'll be less messy. I love the habanero butter and chipotle mayo  Al pastor pork taco - comes with grilled pineapple, jalapeno bacon and pickled red onions  Chipotle cherry steak taco - comes with chili aioli  Peking duck taco - comes with plum and apricot sauce and Brie. The sweetness goes well with the duck",

    "text": "Never thought I'd write a bad review of this place.  It's been my favorite restaurant for years, and the best place to bring newbies or out of town guests.  I frequented so much at one point I was on a first name basis with many of the staff there.  That said, I've noticed it seems to have gone down in quality over the past year and the staff has had a high turnover rate, and that I never recognize anyone anymore.  Still, when I heard about the new menu, I was eager to try it all out.  My friend and I stopped in yesterday evening.  We ordered two happy hour frozen marg's with a 'flavor'shooter (mango and acai).  The large salsa was completely watered down and flavorless.  So bad, that I mentioned it to the waitress, who commented she noticed the exact same thing, and that it happens when the staff fails to 'stir' the batch of salsa.  She later brought a 'thicker' batch over, but it was still watery and tasteless.  For dinner I ordered street corn, a vegetarian taco and a tamale (new).   The corn was good, although less seasoning and cheese than in the past.  I never received the taco I ordered.  The tamale was cold when I cut into it.  Not like 'luke warm sitting for a bit', but cold as in - never even heated up.  The waitress offered to bring me a new one, but at that point between the bad salsa and not receiving the taco I just declined.  The manager came over and apologized, and offered to take care of my drink for me instead, which I thanked him for.  When we received the bill, however, the drink cost was still on there.  Additionally, the happy hour margarita was $9.  I asked about it and was told the add-in flavor was an additional $2.50.  Seriously?  The margs USED to be $5 with $1.00 for the added flavor.  $6.50 for a hh marg PLUS $2.50 for the flavoring is extreme.  I understand needing to raise prices, but if that's the case, give your customers a heads up about the additional costs.  So between the water-salsa, not receiving a taco, the cold tamale and over priced drinks, both my friend and I agreed it will be a LONG time before we frequent again.  It's a shame too, because it used to be one of the best places in the valley.  *UPDATE* I've updated from 1 star to 3 stars to reflect past experiences at the restaurant.  Additionally, the manager kindly reached out regarding my concerns and assured me they would be addressed in the future.  I appreciate any business who is willing to listen to its long standing customers.",

I got three tacos and to be honest they all kind of tasted the same, it was hard to figure out which was which. I got the street corn, and while that was definitely the best part of the meal, the portion for the price was not awesome. The sides in general were not priced according to the size. Don't get me wrong, I'd definitely go back but they're not the best option in town.   PS. If I could I would defiantly give this place a 3.5.",

First thing you will notice is the building! In its previous life, it was a church, and they have done an incredible job of repurposing it into a taco place. The stained glass windows and wood everywhere is impressive. The bar is large (the only place I've sat) and the bartenders are friendly and make a great margarita.   My only complaint (which doesn't change my opinion of the place) is the price. This isn't your typical $20 for a boat load of tacos place. It is expensive for tacos, yes, but the quality of food is great.",

    "text": "Taco Guild is spectacular for so many reasons but I think the biggest one is that it's so unique! I mean, where else in the Valley can you get duck and Brie, cherry rubbed steak, or lamb tacos?! They also offer lettuce wrapped tacos in place of tortillas, for all you low-carbers.   They serve a variety of complimentary salsas with chips and their guacamole is out of this world! The service is always very prompt as well. My office is down the street and Taco Guild has become our favorite spot for a celebratory lunch. Definitely a must-try in the Phoenix area!",

    "text": "One of my favorite taco places. I got a pork burrito the 1st time I went here and then tacos the 2nd time. The pork burrito is a good portion-sized! And their pork is AMAZING. The tacos are flavorful! And the best part is their $2.50 Taco-of-the-day during happy hour!! I got the chance to try fish tacos and roasted chicken tacos- both delicious and flavorful. The Peking duck taco is super. It has a weird fruity twist to it. And corn on a cob is absolutely mouthwatering.  And to top it all off, the service was great. I mean the 1st time I went, they were busy and it took a long time, and they messed up our order a couple times, but our waiter was so nice and apologetic and gave us several tacos- on the house. The second time I was there, they overcooked the corn (which was still tasty and not burnt at all) and they gave us another corn on a cob for free.   It's always nice to have that considerate and thoughtful aspect in a restaurant!",

We knew it was going to be a bit of a wait, but after two hours, we found out they didn't have our names of the wait list.  They corrected this issue quickly, which was appreciated.    Food was good, liked having some unique options for the meal.  The duck tacos were fantastic.  The tacos were quite filling, so only needed two to make a great meal.    The decor in this old church was amazing.    Not my typical sort of haunt, but great food, good service, and a fun time.",

I received the initial text saying I was added to the waitlist, but 40 minutes later I still never received a text about the table being ready. I went inside and checked on my place in line, and was told that another person came in and took my table, then was told that they texted me twice to say my table was ready (which one is it?) but I never showed up. I showed the hostess the text with just the initial confirmation of being added to the list and nothing else after that. She apologized and took us to the table.   My friend had fish tacos and said they were good. I had the $13 beef enchiladas and they were really just mediocre, nothing special, not worth the 40 or even 25 minute wait. Drinks weren't anything special either.   I don't understand the hype over this place, it just didn't do it for me. I don't plan on returning.",

    "text": "My family and I had a really great evening outing at Taco Guild, and I can understand why they're one of the undisputed leaders of the Phoenix taco scene.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  As a converted Methodist Church, Taco Guild has one of the coolest atmospheres of any restaurant I've been to in the country, and they combine it with top notch service even when things get busy (as they were on a Thursday evening over the holidays. The food comes out quick and there are chips and dips to hold you over until they do. Star.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  My only gripe with Taco Guild is their pricing. I'm no newbie to contemporary new world tacos and the fact that they're often priced well above the $1.50 you'll spend per taco on the street, but the small tacos at Taco Guild will often run you $4.95, which is just crazy given their portion size. I both wanted to and could have ordered six of these tacos just for myself, but spending upwards of $30 for tacos for one person was ridiculous. No Star.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  I ordered the Al Pastor, Coffee Braised Beef, and Peking Duck tacos in addition to the Pozole soup of the day, and it was all divine. The pozole was surprisingly the standout dish of the evening, but the meats and peripherals in these tacos was fantastic, and made all the better thanks to the fresh made tortillas. Wonderful. Two Stars.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  It will cost you, but yes I would gladly eat at Taco Guild daily. Star.",

I understand it may be a seasonal reason. I also ordered a vegetarian taco, requested on a corn tortilla, served on flour. No biggie, but if I had diet restrictions, I would have said something.

The coffee braised beef was way too  sweet. The chicken was not exciting. The chipotle cherry steak was the best, by a small margin, but the blue cheese really brings it down. The corn tortillas were too thick. Our server was really sweet, but the hostess took thirty minutes to seat us with 4-5 empty and clean tables available to them, so maybe they were understaffed?

Actually it'd be really nice if it didnt feel so weird to be in a former church, and I'm not even religious.  But I was praying that the food here would be so good that I could make a \"sacrilicious\" joke.  It's not.  I saw a ton of older white people and lots of yoga women etc.  I should have known I was in trouble when there was a Starbucks and a Buffalo Exchange both right next to it.  But I felt committed, and then saw the menu.  Fine, put your stupid pineapple on your al pastor, people love it.  But Jesus Christ, how much mango and jicama slaw can you jam into your handmade but bland as hell corn tortillas?  I don't want dessert tacos.  I blame white people for this.  I love you, white people, but look at what the fuck you've done.   This shit is hilariously overpriced, sweet, and a horrid bastardization of everything that should be right with tacos.

The GM contacted me and apologized and asked if we would return and see the changes they have made as a result of the reviews here on Facebook.  That is amazing! Our reviews make a difference.    Well, of course I would go back. I love everything about the food at Taco Guild.  So back we went. We sat at the bar...and within minutes we were welcomed and invited to review Happy Hour pricing. We talked about various drinks and met \"Michael\" - the bartender.  PERFECT!  Honestly.  I barely got my order in with Michael and the chips and salsa - warm and oh so yummy - were placed in front of us. Waters delivered promptly and dishes, napkins and utensils arrived immediately...it was magical.  Did we want to eat?  Yes, yes we do! We ordered tacos and a salad and then more chips arrived and drinks were filled and we were just settling in and our food arrive.  IMMEDIATELY.  Or well, my hubby's food arrived...my steak took longer than the expected so my salad was a tad longer to arrive.  Still unsure how that happened but...it eventually arrived and I had more time to monopolize the warm and tasty chips.  The salad was new to me. I liked it a lot. I would have liked a tad more cheese and nuts, but the fruit and streak was perfect.  The Kale was substantial and very crunchy.  I even took some home for lunch :-).  Kale is the best!  I wasn't offered dessert so I don't know if they have any.  I was offered another drink, and I gladly ordered one and left with quite a warm and happy feeling. For the record, that was three drinks and I was not driving :-).    I highly recommend Michael at the bar. He's delightful and very engaging.  He is thoughtful and attentive.  He works most evenings.  I observed him with the other patrons and he was equally efficient with everyone. Thank you Michael.",

It strangely tastes like canned corn when they do that. Never again! On the cob is the way to go! The decor is breathtaking and unique and adds to the wonderful ambience. The salsa trio is also fabulous! I'm so lucky to live nearby so I can frequent taco guild.",

We were seated at our table and waited 10 minutes for chips and salsa and another 5 minutes for water and to place drink orders.  The meals ordered were staggered in time arriving.  The food was so so - steak salad had too dull of a knife to cut the meat with.  The place itself is very cool.  Service SUB PAR/food not that good.  Prices are a little high.  3 out of 5 stars.",

Delicious chicken, cheese, rice and bean ratio in the burrito. It's seriously my version of perfect!! I did ask for it without the pico because I'm just not a fan of that in my burritos.

The inside of the restaurant is SO COOL and has a great vibe. They have daily taco and soup specials. Their cocktail menu is beautiful. I had the Forbidden Fruit and it was really delicious and refreshing. The chips were fresh and tasty, and the salsa was some of the best I've ever had. Be careful...the green salsa is deceptively hot but sooo good! I had a pork adovada and guild chicken taco - excellent!! The tortillas were fresh and perfectly prepared. The meat was quality, and the toppings/garnish did not overpower the taco. I also had a cup of the soup of the day which was a creamy roasted corn and poblano. It was definitely the hit of the evening. So so good and perfectly seasoned. My whole meal was less than $25! I couldn't believe it. I will absolutely be back and can't wait to bring my whole crew.

    "text": "The only thing better than a word of mouth recommendation, is a word of mouth recommendation that leads you to tacos! When my girlfriend heard about Taco Guild, she sent me a photo of what was clearly a church, saying \"I want to go here\". When I realized tacos were involved, I was more than happy to oblige.  It only took a few minutes, sitting at the bar next to an incredible selection of tequila, for us to realize how wickedly cool this place is. Yes. Wicked. I realize it was a church. It has candles, art work, exposed wooden trusses, the original stained glass windows, and an altar dedicated to libations.  The first thing you may notice is the extra-ordinary chips and salsa (see photo below) which includes a medium spiced main dish. It is complemented with three more varieties of salsa to spice it up a bit. This is the first bowl of chips and salsa that we have failed to finish. It's generous! And there was a lot of great food and beverage to enjoy...  The Fresh Ceviche was a perfect item to follow the chips. It had mango, avocado, shrimp and bay scallops with onion, tomato and peppers. It was light and refreshing and highly recommended.  In order to sample the most menu on this trip, we each ordered a three taco plate with sides. The Spanish rice was the only low point on my plate. It sounded promising but didn't deliver much more than most similar dishes. My girlfriend's street corn was unbelievable. We agreed that if it was the only thing on the plate, we would've been happy. It made up for the less than zesty rice.  We shared and compared notes, so I can say that all six tacos were enjoyable. The only taco she didn't care for was the shrimp. However, the pulled Guild Chicken was surprisingly moist and had great texture. The Chipotle Cherry Streak was a surprise. Great marinade! And my favorite... The Ono taco which had the single most generous portion of grilled fish I've ever had on a taco! Great sauce and the usual cabbage accompaniment. Plus, I've never had Ono on a taco! This was a very filling and satisfying meal!  Our bar tender Selena was amazing! We were greeted and received our beverages promptly. Not only was she friendly, but she had cool anecdotes to share about the premises. We will be asking for her excellent service the next time we are in the area.  Judging by my Yelp! motto, I'd be one happy camper if Taco Guild was my last meal!",

    "text": "Take me to church! Or at least if church is like Taco Guild, I'd be there errday!  Located about 3 miles north of downtown PHX (N 7th & Osborne), Taco Guild is in an old church complete with stained glass and gothic candelabras - the coolest vibe. They have a great outdoor patio with light misters to keep you comfortable, but we ventured inside to enjoy the ambiance. The hubby and I really wanted to order the street corn and found that they have a special - if you order 3 tacos, you get a side of street corn (on the cob or off) for only $2.75, so we both chose that. Margaritas ordered, we dove into our tacos. I chose the adovada pork, yucatan shrimp, and the guild chicken. My least favorite was the pork. I should've gone with the al pastor. The chicken was my favorite and I could have ordered 3 more of those! The street corn was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The habanero butter and chipotle mayo made the overall flavor perfection.  3 tacos and a side is plenty for one person. We were both full after we finished our plates. They do give you complimentary tortilla chips for the table which includes a trio of sauces - a chili-spiced salsa, a green thick tomatilla-esque sauce, and a red habanero sauce. Mmmm!  When we visit PHX again, this place will definitely be on the list!",

I mean this when I say, the tacos tonight were the most underwhelming sad excuse for high end tacos. I ordered the mahi mahi taco and the pork pineapple taco. The fish taco I legitimately removed the mass of lettuce to see if there was any fish in there...there was, but barely! What a joke. I've had better fish tacos from a 2 dollar taco stand on the side of the road. The pork taco equally bad. I remember back in the day it would have all this wonderful fresh pineapple on top...not a single piece present on this taco. All and all a really disappointing experience.",

    "text": "This is my first review. I've never left a review on a place before. Why? Well if an establishment delivers the service they promote, well good for them. Why review someone just because they do their job? That's what their continued business and paychecks are for.  If it is less than satisfactory, well maybe it was an off day for the staff or management. We all have bad days. I chose to go there and I can choose to not go back.   Taco Guild however does not fall into either category which is why I will take the time to share my experience.   To be honest, I was skeptical about coming in. They proudly advertised #2 Mexican Restaurant in the US right on their website. A lot to live up to don't you think? Well, let me tell you, whoever is #1 better be serving edible gold because Taco Guild would never be a runner up on my list.   From the moment we walked in the vibe was contagious. We were created be exceptionally friendly staff and seated almost immediately. Upon seating our server, Jordan, greeted us with a warm smile and was more then generous with his time throughout the evening in offering us suggestions and tips from the menu. Jordan was readily available at all courses. We never once waited for service. He was friendly, outgoing and very knowledgeable in the food selections.   From our appetizers, to our tacos, to our desert and all the way to our drinks at the end, Taco Guild was second to none. The atmosphere was great! Seated in an old church, it was quaint enough to feel cozy, but light enough to keep up with energy of its incoming customers. This was our first time here but it won't be the last. We left with full stomachs and happy hearts, already talking about our next visit.",

Not only am I a True repeat customer as I have been in numerous times after my first visit i feel like I'm now a friend of of the establishment as I know some of the amazing people that work there. One person in particular continues to stand out as AMAZING in everything he does. That is the general manager Justin. When I first met him I thought I was speaking to the owner as he has love and respect for what he does that is out of this world. This man bleeds tequila to say the least. His knowledge of the product is out standing. I have learned so much from him about not only the different kinds of tequila but the history of tequila in general. I used to come for the amazing tacos, great atmosphere, and good vibes, but now I come for the knowledge and history as well. This is all thanks to the GM Justin. Its incredible what he does for this place. Truly incredible. Taco Guild has a customer for life in me. If you haven't been GO. You will not be disappointed. If you don't know Tequila and want to learn about it, have a seat at the bar and allow Justin to paint a picture for you.   Justin thank you for the hospitality. If you ever open your own place, not only would be amazing but you would have me and my friends as regulars!  Kelvin",

There were candelabra's on a couple high tops in the center that were a little too bright but not a deal breaker.  Adam was our server and he knows his stuff. We asked for his suggestions for margarita's and taco's and he was spot on. I am not a fan of frozen margaritas but their house - $5 happy hour margi was awesome. We tried the veggie, duck and lamb taco's with a side of guacamole and their vegan beans.

There was a sauce that looked like ketchup that was delicious and spicy. My favorite. For tacos, we had the shrimp, the lamb, a beef taco, and the chipotle cherry steak taco. All were fabulous, but one stood out. The chipotle cherry steak taco was out of this world. Amazing. And the wait staff was super friendly. We can't wait to go back!",

The staff was welcoming, pleasant, and attentive to our needs.  That aside, the food was very good. Chips and salsa are complimentary and were really delicious. Our party couldn't get enough of the salsa variety.   We had a party of four and everyone ordered something different. All were satisfied with their food choices although my single taco came with nothing and sides have to be ordered separately. Burritos had rice and beans, which were very tasty. It would have been nice to have a little cup of beans or rice with the taco (you get a free side only if you order 3 tacos - too many for me). I had a shrimp taco and ordered a side of local vegetables. The shrimp was plentiful and very tender; the side veggies consisted of zucchini, squash, red bell peppers and Brussel sprouts (the Brussel sprouts were barely visible - only two leaves). I like that they were locally grown; they were fresh and cooked nicely; however, it was too small an amount (about 1/4 cup size) and made me want more.  I would suggest going at an off time since the parking is horrendous. Good food, great venue.",

There are two things Z Tejas does right which are margaritas and chips and dip. Nothing else. Chips and salsa were meh. The happy hour here is terrible. One taco on special and draft beer for $6? It made me sad so I went to Gallo Blanco and turned my frown upside down.",

I ordered one shrimp taco and one chicken taco, both on corn tortillas. They delivered me a lamb and a chicken on flour. It went back and came back correct except I got flour tortillas instead of corn. I just kept them. My husband ordered one duck and one lamb taco on flour. He got 2 completely different tacos. When his came back he enjoyed the lamb but found the duck to be cold and greasy. The third person in our party got the tacos she ordered but they were sure to tell her that the beef taco had no cheese. She did not request it without cheese so they took it back and brought it back as ordered. The manager came by to apologize and offered us free dessert. We took them up on this and got one slice of coconut cream pie which my husband and I enjoyed a lot. Our companions got the Tres Leches cake and also enjoyed it.",

The rest were a little fatty, so we didn't get to eat a lot of the meat in our tacos. It was a lot of awkwardly pulling out the fatty parts of the taco meat. The Elote was really yummy though, and we loved the salsa variety.  Oh, also, our server gave us a little mini history on the church that the restaurant resides in and they have items from a time capsule left by the church on their back wall. Definitely an original touch! Loved that!",

The restaurant is trendy, beautiful, has a lot of character, and a creative menu, but that's where the pro's ended, and why they're getting the 2 stars. I found this place through an event advertisement on Facebook for their 125th anniversary, and decided it sounded like it would be quite the event, so I drove my family of 5 almost 30 miles to try the food and festivities planned for today. We should've stayed home and saved the $100! The waiter was friendly and polite, when we actually saw him, which was almost never. We never did get the sugar we requested twice for our ice tea, so we gave up. We ordered a variety of tacos (Tequila Chicken & Carne Asada) some on corn tortillas, and a few on lettuce cups, but the tacos all showed up on corn tortillas. We also ordered sides of beans, chips, salsa, and queso. The taco meats were cold (chicken and steak), and the steak was not only cold it was dry and tough as if it had been precooked and chopped for quite some time. The salsa varieties are good and tasty, but the queso was also very cool, and was no longer a dip since it had already thickened up. I don't know if this was an atypical experience for this place, but to spend $100 on a dinner that was very poorly executed, and waste the gas from Buckeye to fight rush hour traffic is disappointing to say the least. Of course I would've mentioned a lot of these things to our waiter, had he actually came by the table more than just to take our order, drop our food, and leave a check. ",

    "text": "Life sized murals of Rembrandts line the walls in this high ceilinged church turned restaurant. The stained glass inspires one to an earlier age of divine purpose with quotes such as \"love...in deed and in truth.\" At the center hangs a massive gothic wrought- iron chandelier with candles (LeD).   You will find many more like them throughout.  The two large communal tables also feature gothic candelabra center pieces, giving the place the same ambiance and feel of a Guild Hall from the 1600s. Lighting is low and alluring, noise level one you would expect at a gastropub.  On a  Tuesday night the place was very busy, which says a lot about an establishment.  Very impressed with the bartenders, so skilled at their  craft and knowledgable about the menu.  Ambiance and decor I give this place 4 stars. Service and Staff: 4 stars. Food is sadly only 3 stars, and here is why.  First off, the drinks are amazing!  Great craft cocktail menu overall as well as many local beers on draft such as Cartel, Papago, Four peaks and San tan. The Blushing senorita was my favorite! Coppola rosso, hangar one berry vodka, raspberries, blueberries and blackberries.  Order it as the Virgin Senorita for a fabulous non-alcoholic cocktail.  We ordered the The Duo Guild which is one small portion each of their guacamole and the queso. Upon a recommendation, we ordered the Guac with the jalapeno bacon.  Sadly all we could taste was bacon, and I personally feel that bacon has no place in Guacamole, unless you don't like the taste and texture of Avocados.  So, the bartender happily switched out our order and gave us the traditional Guac instead.  It essentially tasted like smashed avocadoes, and lacked any specific flavor or spice level.  You get spoiled when you have Guacamole at places like the \"Mission\", so we were very unimpressed.  The Queso was unremarkable, it virtually tasted like the Nacho cheese you get at the movie theater.    Next came the House salad with cilantro dressing.  While the creamy and flavorful cilantro dressing is delicious, the lettuce had all the appeal of a cheap bag of iceberg in a bag at the grocery store, and the sliced avocados on top did not help much.  The side of Corn off the cob grilled in jalapeno butter was a side we ordered along with our three tacos, but aside from a little heat at the end also remained uninspired.  This restaurant being called \"Taco Guild\", I was ready to be wowed and to find some divine inspiration in one of my favorite comfort foods.  We sampled the Al pastor, the  taco, cherry steak, and lamb.  Al Pastor: Grilled pineapple, jalapeno bacon, pickled red onion.  Least favorite.  When you have been in the south of Mexico and noshed on an Al Pastor from a street vendor, with merely the flavor of the succulent and marinated meat and fresh cilantro and a squirt of lime - you get disappointed when every restaurant wants to add pineapple and weird pickled onions or essentially just distract you from the fact that the meat itself isn't all that great. So, no bueno on this one.  The Cherry Steak Taco.  Crispy poblano onion straws, chile aioli, bleu cheese.   Awesome!  And then just a bit strange.  Disclaimer: I love bleu cheese, and it pairs well with a good cut of meat.  Add the onion straws and a little kick of chili and it's a very good combination - but it doesnt really taste like a taco but a steak wrap.  Completely americanized taco, in my opinion not a good choice for the taco purist.  The Molida Lamb taco.  Creole aioli, bleu cheese, sweet potato hay.  Again, same interesting combination as above, but I don't think lamb works with bleu cheese or creole seasonings.  My tastebuds prefer mediterranean combinations.  This would have been great with a garlic tzatziki instead of bleu cheese.  I would definitely come back here for cocktails and socializing, the salsa and chips are excellent, and I would possibly sample other items on the menu - but when I have a Taco craving I would rather venture to Joyride or basically any authentic Mexican taqueria where I know what to expect and pay $1-2 instead of $3-$5 for a taco that isn't really a taco.  Please add fresh cilantro to all your dishes.  I believe I spotted some, but it looked wet and tired and I tasted none of it.  Kudos to your incredible house hot sauces.  We loved all three, in mild medium and hot.  Mild is a green jalapeno which burns a tad at the end but delicious. Spicy, the habanero chili, is amazing!!! Medium is Chili Pequin (chile de Arbol, chili Pequin, tomato sauce, garlic, salt, white vinegar, agave nectar).  The chefs may be hesitant to kick the food up a notch, but I want to be the biggest fan of this place, as I love the space and the staff and the entire concept.  Just adding fresh cilantro and limes to the tacos, and maybe offering some more simple tacos for us purists, would create some enlightenment.",

    "text": "I tried Taco Guild for the first time a few weeks back. We were booze cruising for a \"friends\" birthday and this was our first stop to grab some food. Walking in and realizing that the place was at one time a Methodist church was pretty cool and getting drunk in a old Methodist church was even better! First thing we noticed is that there really isn't a ton of tables so I would assume that there can be some pretty heft wait times during the busy hours.  4 of us bellied up to the bar as the tables were packed. Our bartender/waitress was awesome and was very helpful as 3 of us never ate there before. Looking over the menu, there wasn't a massive amount of items to choose from which was a pretty nice change of pace. I got the grilled steak burrito as it looked to be the most appetizing thing on the menu to me (i'm not an overly adventurous eater, I like simplicity). We had a bowl of chips and salsas/hot sauces and I ended up eating a whole thing of it on my own lol. The regular house salsa was awesome, not too spicy but a decent kick after a few chips. There was a habanero hot sauce that was pretty good as well.  Once my steak burrito came out, I jumped right in. I used some of the salsas/hot sauces but the food did not need it at all. The steak was cooked perfect and was juicy and some of the best I've eaten in Phoenix (I am a HUGE carne asada buff too). I destroyed the burrito in no time and probably could have eaten another one but decided against it as we were biking around Phoenix and it was hot.   My buddy got a couple of the lamb tacos and I was blown away by it. I HATE blue cheese with a passion, its gross and just no. I took a bite of one of the tacos with everything on it and it was amazing. We ended up ordering a few more before taking off.  I have been thinking about this place nonstop since I ate there but haven't had the chance to from being busy. I will probably get the same thing again as I said, nothing else looked like my cup of tea (other then the lamb taco) and I will enjoy every second of it.  I gave 4 stars because i will honestly only eat the 2 things I mentioned but its a 5 star joint, prices were very fair and the drinks were made right.",

Housed in a vacated Greek Orthodox church, they've done a lovely job by leaving the stained glass windows and murals and making the vestibule into a small dining area.  Not many food options, limited menu. I got the tacos because they had interesting options...lamb and duck were my choices. The rest of the menu is kind of meh and overpriced.

    "text": "Writing this actually makes me sad.  I would actually like to rate it a 2.5 but I'm being kind and rounding up because I am hugely appreciative of what they have done with the building.  That being said when architecture is the 1st thing that comes to mind when talking about a restaurant, there is probably some room for improvement.  The usage of the space is remarkable. It's a very trendy looking place with warm tones and despite it being one large open room, they were able to pull off at least the appearance of intimacy. But that's where the warmth stops.  The deafening mix of customer driven music selection is way too loud. It is almost impossible to hear anyone even at a small four top without leaning in and utilizing your best lip reading skills.  And if the owners could limit the techno trance options to maybe 1/3 of the options, I would gladly toss in another half star.  The bar is spectacular however, so if you just want someplace to just soak in the atmosphere, park yourself under the magnificent chandelier and drink it in.  The menu is less than user friendly.  Everything listed is ala carte, however there seem to be combos available which only appear to be available to people on the inner circle.  We even asked if there was a possibility of getting a quesadilla (since tortillas and cheese are key components of several items) and were told that if it's not listed on the menu, it is not available.  The prices are way out of line with other similar venues.  The tacos are $4 per and they are the smallest street tacos I have seen in a very long time. They are not bad. They are just four bites and that is way too steep.  The burros are reasonably priced for what you get, so go with one of those if you don't eat like America's Next Top Model. The salsas (both fresh and bottled) are good but the chips come straight out of a bag and that irritates me. If you are going to sell yourself as a gastropub, you need to be able to carry off the \"gastro\" portion of the title. Everything else seems fresh, why would you chintz on the chips?!!  And the $8 guacamole? It's ok but no more. Yes it's fresh and clearly made on site but it is not worth even half that. I love that you can select chunky or smooth but that is where the love story ends.  Service is my final pick point. Our order taker was very friendly, but the four other people that sporadically delivered food left a lot to be desired.  There was a five minute lag between the first taco hitting our table and the last burro... unacceptable; and then we had to ask for the guacamole that was delivered and then were told they had given it to another table by mistake. They took that off the check but it just added to the already uneven service.  So I will probably give it another try after they have had some time to work the kinks out.  And I truly hope they do. Like I said, I'm unbelievably happy they have saved the building and I like what they have done with it for the most part. Now if they could just bring the food up to level of the space and work on the service it would be great place to hang out.",

I also give the service 5 star. Sat at the bar and the service we received was exceptional.  As far as the food - it was a bit mediocre to me. The tacos are upscale and depending on what kind you get, between $3 and $5 a taco. If you get three, you get a free side. For being this expensive, I figured there would be more flavor with the tacos. I've had much better at hold in the wall places to be honest.   The chips and guac were perfect though - I had that for the starter. Plus the salsa is very good as well. I'd give it a try if you're interested in checking it out - I'd probably go back for happy hour sometime.",

    "text": "This is the True definition of gastropub (A public house which serves upscale food but with a primary mission of being a bar).  So, if a restaurant knows what they are, then I am not going to judge them on things that would never apply.  When I was in Ireland, did I make a reservation at a pub?  No! OK, enough on my thoughts on the commentary of reviews judging them on reservations, waiting on food, blah blah.    Now, let's get to the review.  We showed up with no reservation and I am not sure they even take them; but who cares?  It's an upscale pub.  We no sooner sat down when we were asked what we'd like to drink.  The beers here are only local breweries so if you want bud light, forget about it.    The tacos were unique street tacos. Very tasty and well presented.  I would recommend getting the queso/guacamole starter.  Be careful not to go crazy ordering food.  This operates just like a pub so you can order add-on. They don't have hot plate service so when food is done, it is brought to the table.  Like I said, order in small orders like you would ordering a pint with food in a pub and you'll get it.  The place is very nicely decorated and servers equally awesome.  About the only drawback is the parking and this location lacks it after 5:30 PM - of course that would explain the valet required.  This is a pub with fantastic food.  It's pretty 'dern unique and makes for a nice meet-up place before going large in the naked city of Phoenix.",

Normally, I would have sent it all back but I was with a party of 5, and I didn't want to mess up the dinner. The side dish was a whole other story. The last time I was there they brought a bowl of corn that was (no joke) 50% oil. It was inedible. This time I specifically asked for street corn, which they normally cut off the cob at the table. After being assured this is what I would be getting, of course, they brought the bowl of greasy glop and denied that they scooped it out of a bin filled with butter. When I called them on it they assured me I was wrong. No point in fighting with them...just won't be going back.",

Both are mexican restaurants set in old churches that have since been renovated, however upon entering Taco Guild I found the ambiance of Taco Guild to be much different. It is warm and inviting, with vaulted ceilings and almost an upscale pub feel. I loved it. We were sat right away, and we tried quite a bit of food. The chorizo meatballs were extremely tender and basically melted in your mouth. The queso dip had the perfect level of spice and an excellent texture. Their chips are very good, and their guacamole is made fresh and the perfect consistency of \"not too smooth, not too chunky.\" I also ordered the a shrimp taco and a chicken taco on lettuce, and they were both wonderful. I love this place because it's affordable, charming, and has really excellent mexican food that is fresh and flavorful. I will absolutely be coming back soon!",

The decor of this place is unlike anything I have seen in Phoenix ever, and I've been here my whole life.  This place is housed in an old church and is nothing short of beautiful.  We sat down at the bar and were promptly greeted by Kristin. She was awesome!!  She was incredibly helpful with helping us choose food and cocktails!  For drinks I ordered The Blushing Senorita, which consists of Coppola Rossa, Hanger One berry vodka, fresh raspberries, blueberries and blackberries and my boyfriend ordered The Myth.  All I can say is Hallelujah! If you want the best hand made cocktail in town, sit at the bar at Taco Guild and ask for Kristin! She's definitely been studying her cocktail bible.  For Food, Kristin helped us decide what to order since we had never been there before.  We ended up ordering The Guild Duo to start and it was amazing! Awesome Guacamole and Fire Roasted Chile Queso that holds the key to my heart.  For dinner, I ordered the Molida Lamb Taco and the Cherry Steak Taco upon recommendation from Kristin.  My Boyfriend ordered the Thai Snapper Taco and the Peking Duck Taco.  These tacos were the best tacos we both have ever had! I have an addiction now and its for Taco Guild Tacos.  If you want THE BEST TACOS, COCKTAILS, AND BARTENDER, then go to Taco Guild and sit at the bar and ask for KRISTIN!!!  She gives impeccable service!!",

The main room is very loud but if you sit in the front part of the former vestibule, it's much more pleasant. - Good sangria. - Friendly server. - Tacos are good, the lamb was my favorite.  Cons: - Expensive. I like America's Tacos just as much (and their corn is better) and my bill will be far less. Granted, not the same atmosphere, but come on, did Phoenix really need another place to get tacos?  - Service was iffy. Our party of five was willing to overlook given the business is new, despite this being a concept restaurant from an established restaurant chain that one would presume has its act together. But the food did not come at the same time, served one plate at a time with about 5+ minutes wait  in between. Only the first person served (who politely waited and ate his food cold) got exactly what they ordered. Only I got my dinner delivered from our server. The rest was brought by mystery staff who weren't all that friendly. - The charge for the bill was wrong. Our server blithely told us to pay however we wanted, so one of our party paid for two people and the entire tip. Two of us discovered the next day that the restaurant had charged each card 20% extra, effectively changing the amount from the signed slips.  The bottom line for me is, I would only go there again for an occasion. And I would take cash.",

    "text": "I tried Taco Guild again and the second experience was WAY better the second time around.  I'll definitely be going back.  The service was awesome, music wasn't as loud, food was amazing as always.  This time we sat at one of the high tops instead of a booth and I thought it was way cooler to be able to look around and check out the cool design of the place.  On this visit I tried the veggie tacos and they exceeded my expectations--they were tastier than my non-veggie tacos since they were marinated (I think?) roasted veggies.  We also ordered the corn and had them cut it in half, one of my favorites.  We ordered cocktails and if it weren't for the price to strength of the cocktail ratio I would have given them 5 stars.  The drinks were good!....But, for the price ($9-$11ish) they had less alcohol than I'd prefer.  That's an expensive drink in my opinion and I'm not splurging for a second one at that price if it's a lot of filler.",

I decided to take my mom out to dinner for her birthday since she wanted to try something new. Atmosphere and ambiance are definitely cool. As for the food it was not even that good. Everything we ordered was missing flavor. We started off with the guacamole with bacon. That needed ALOT of salt. And I don't even like salty food. I ordered the shrimp taco and the thai snapper. They were OK. You can definitely get better somewhere else for half the price. Their tortillas are weird too, too thick in my opinion. We also tried the corn and that was good, but again needed salt. Taco Guild needs to step up their game on FLAVOR!! I would only go back for a margarita and chips and salsa. Our waitress was not that great either. 2 stars is all you get Taco Guild.",

    "text": "\"A lovely atmosphere, decent service, but unacceptably bad food.\"  I deeply wanted Taco Guild to be a success.  That's not to say that my expectations were too high, only that I would enjoy a restaurant that fit this description.  I'm not even opposed to the concept - a la carte tacos, many of them gringo influenced.  However, when it comes down to it, this was a horribly conceived menu.  My date and I tried nearly every taco.  She reminds me to tell you how bad the salsa was.  This is True, in addition to all of their house-made hot sauces.  Something different tastes bad in each of them.  The mild red sauce, for instance, tasted bitter and bland.  We ordered an appetizer of ceviche.  Ceviche should be fresh and crisp.  This dish was a pile of mango salsa and scallops.  The tacos.  I don't even mind paying $5 a taco.  All of them were bad.  The meat in each is way too dry. The flavor combinations sound good on paper - but none of them were executed well.  We tried the pastor, the urban bean coffee braised beef, the lamb, the duck, the Thai snapper.  Bad bad bad.  Even the sides were bad.  The beans were a bowl of dirt and turmeric.  I will briefly mention the drinks.  I only tried \"The Legend.\"  Roger Clyne's mescal with an orange liquor and ground pepper.  The $9 drink is a glass of orange juice.  I can't even just get drinks here.  I will say, I loved the decor, the converted church theme, the servers were friendly.  I even like Ztejas - so you'd expect this venture would be better.  Maybe if they retool the menu, but even so the damage is done.  Check out the cool building while it's still open.",

We got our appetizers AFTER our main course with no side of chips for our appetizer of different dips. We had to basically fight for his attention, clear our own plates from our table and wait forever for our checks. Weak margaritas too, which was a bummer. I've never felt so ignored at an establishment in my life. My first 2 visits were great and the food was so yummy but this experience left a real bad taste in my mouth. The service was so bad!!! I don't know if they were just understaffed tonight but their attitudes didn't help the situation. I was definitely disappointed.",

During my last visit to the restaurant, the manager stopped by our table to ask how we enjoyed our food. Undoubtedly, everything was delicious, but my friend mentioned noticing a recipe change - the duck taco was different than she remembered and she preferred the other version. In an extremely candid conversation, the manager explained that their chef had been trying multiple recipes, trying to lock down the \"perfect\" duck taco. He expressed gratitude for our transparency and treated us to their Tres Leches Cake, which was 10/10. That type of personable interaction, along with a delicious and eclectic array of tacos, is the kind of experience that will make me a loyal supporter of Taco Guild for years to come.   P.S., the cherry steak taco was out of this world!!!",

If the service is anything like the first few times before I'll be more than happy to edit my review again. Since that's all I'm looking for anyway! I've always enjoyed the Taco Guild and I want to be able to enjoy it again...   None the less, I'm very pleased that Taco Guild took their time to reach out to a frustrated customer, hear me out, and resolve the issue. That's how more restaurants should be like!",

Dinner is just as delicious while sitting in those big cushy chairs! Cheers!",

The street corn is by far the star on the menu and their habanero butter sauce has a spicy food lover like myself craving more. I give it 4 instead of 5 stars merely because I was a little bummed that the duck tacos might as well been chicken because the duck wasn't soft and juicy like I had expected it to be, it didn't even taste any different from the chicken which was a little disappointing since I love duck and they serve it at so few places. I suggest a slower cook and more sauce for heavens sake! You make the chili sauce on it sound so good but I could barely taste it. Anyway take from it what you will, I am coming back just the same to try more tacos.",

I love the vibes of Taco Guild and the building's charm, but the food doesn't meet expectations. I was excited to try the many interesting \"New World Tacos\" like molida lamb and peking duck, but really couldn't get down with the flavors. Even the classic tacos left more to be desired.   Prices match other restaurants in the area, and the hipster vibes are there. The prices do not reflect the taco quality - you're better off hitting a more casual, authentic Mexican place. If I were to return, I'd stick to margaritas or maaayyybeee try something besides tacos. But really, if the tacos don't impress, what's the point?  +5 building's charm +4 drinks -2 tacos",

On the taco menu, there's old world tacos and new world tacos. It's basically the traditional tacos or new & fusion tacos.  I decided to get the taco plate which is 3 tacos plus a side. My choices: al pastor pork, urban bean coffee braised beef, and tropical ono with elote corn. While waiting for our food, we were given homemade chips with a selection of salsa to dip with. First off, chips were delicious! Each salsa definitely had a kick to it. If you like spicy, you'll like the salsa. When I get my taco plate, I was surprised at how loaded each taco was. If you don't like getting your hands dirty, you may not enjoy this. Overall, my favorite was the beef. It was super good and with the salsa, it made it better. My least favorite was the ono. I've had better. This was okay. The corn on the side was delicious. Order this off the cob if you don't want to use your hands or eat off the cob.  What's really cool about this place is that it's in a church, or what used to be a church. The chandelier is super pretty and I love the stained glass windows.",

Why, oh why did I deprive my soul of their tasty goodness? For years and years, I have wandered the earth, an empty shell of a man, hardly aware of the True good in the universe....the goodness that is Taco Guild! I have lived a life of True taco celibacy until now. I have been enlightened. My spirit awakened by the glorious cooks that have surely been guided by the hand of the Almighty! Chipotle Cherry Steak tacos are mana from heaven, able to please even the harshest of food critics and if the Chiplotle Cherry Steak tacos are that good, then the Coffee Braised Beef is communion for your food soul, bringing salvation to our hunger! Being prepared by Angels, their Grilled Seasonal Vegetable taco would bring the most devout carnivores to a moment of veggie weakness, forcing them to give up their meaty ways! From a fantastic atmosphere and phenomenal service to possibly the best tacos I have yet enjoyed, this place gets 10 out of 5 stars!",

    "text": "Having been here just over a half-dozen times, maybe it's time to write a review to let you good folks know why I choose to come back here more frequently than any of the many other, independent-ish, hip and tasty restaurants in the downtown Phoenix area.    I'm not going to spend time talking about the awesome look and feel of having a restaurant in a re-purposed old church, complete with stained glass windows, beautiful open-beam ceilings and...and I digress.  Food.  More specifically, tacos.  Amazing tacos with unique and wonderful flavors.  When was the last time you had a lamb or duck taco?  On house-made tortillas?  With the exception of the vegetable taco (seriously?), I've had them all.  My 4 consistently awesome, favorites are: Chipotle Cherry Steak, Pork Adovada, Al Pastor Pork & Urban Bean Coffee Braised Beef.  In that order.    I'm told that the the Street Corn is not-to-be-missed, but I've missed it so far.  I'll get it eventually.  The guac is absolutely terrific, and the the four salsas with the complimentary chips are very flavorful, no doubt due in no small part to the use of fresh, locally grown produce.    And finally, the sides.  All are good, but on my visit Thursday, the Borracho Red Beans were different than they've been in the past, and as long as they stay this way, they will be the only side I consider from here on out.  Whatever the change, keep it!  I'm tired of typing, and if you made it this far, you're tired of reading.  Check out the Taco Guild, take your friends.  Do it after work and sample the tequila bar too.",

We did come right at lunch so there was a slight wait but we were seated in the \"quieter room\" as the bigger room does echo and can be noisy. Our waitress was really attentive and serve was great overall. Chips and salsa were wonderful, I liked that was a mild salsa and other options to spice it up. I ordered the chicken enchiladas, my friend ordered the taco plate and corn. I personally thought the tacos were pretty expensive but they looked great! My chicken enchilada plate came with 2 enchiladas, rice and black beans. Food was great!!   I will definitely be back- probably would like to try again for HH or dinner.",

I am so glad that we were seated in the back room away from the main dining room as the DJ began a set at 6pm and the music was very loud and would have made conversation nearly impossible. I want to try this place during lunch when the music isn't deafening so that I can truly experience the atmosphere of dining in the old sanctuary. Perhaps management should consider having the DJ after 9pm.  After reading all of the reviews, I was worried that I was going to have bland tacos and dry street corn, but I experienced exactly the opposite. The tacos were yummy and very generous in their fillings and the street corn was fresh and delicious. I had the cherry steak with cojita (not a fan of bleu cheese) and the peking duck taco. The duck taco was a great combination of spicy and sweet and was my favorite. We also ordered the house guacamole. It was lacking salt and lime, but was okay with tortilla chips.   Complimentary valet is the only option for parking, so we chose to park in the neighborhood and had no issue nor safety concerns. We will be back, but will try it during lunchtime instead.",

It was huge though, so since that came out first we were pretty stuffed by the time the tacos came out.  I think they could work on their beer selection a little bit; they seemed to be out of a lot of stuff when we were there.  The setting was gorgeous.

Definitely found us a NEW spot to come to when we are back in town next year.",

Brittany our server didn't smile once, we have never been here and we were hoping for an introduction of what this place is all about and what their specials were... we didn't get nothin... didn't even tell us her name (found out from the receipt) once we got the food it was very bland dad and I liked the shrimp taco, the chicken was awful (maybe that's why they put it in the middle) don't think we will be returning. The atmosphere is neat but the service ruined it for us.",

Go with the Guild Duo as an appetizer, queso and guac are a heavenly combination. I've tried several tacos (which were all good) but the romaine salad with chicken is by far my favorite. The chicken has the perfect charred taste that I like to let you know it is grilled but not overdone. I would eat here everyday if I wasn't concerned with my health.",

I have frequently stopped at the Starbucks in the same parking lot and the smells have always made me think I have to try that place out!! Well today was the day and I am just sorry it's taken me this long to enjoy the foodie delights that awaited me inside! My friend, her son & I went the Children's Museum and it was the perfect way to end the fun filled day! Carlos was are Amazingly attentive server and her guided us through the menu! We did the taco platters- we each had 3 different choices with the corn added! I had the beef, pork and Delish Duck!! It was like a Flavor Party in my mouth and all the tastebuds were digging the vibes for sure!! Desmond our little man had a quesadilla and he devoured half of it enjoying every bite! The margarita was perfect as well!! Well done Taco Guild!! Great atmosphere, food, drinks and service!! A+",

I would say the al pastor is a little weak, but the beef was excellent, as was the shrimp. The street corn was farrrrr from the best I've ever had, but it is corn covered in mayo and cheese so I can't say I didn't like it. The only warning I would give is this place is suuuuper trendy, so expect a long wait, and very loud music.",

    "text": "Definitely in agreement with the four stars on this restaurant.  I actually found them on a list of the ten top taco places to try in the country.  Not sure where the list came from or if I'd actually put them on that (criteria are subjective on any list), but I'm glad I looked them up and grabbed dinner on my recent visit.  They have a pretty diverse menu with interesting choices.  Food is well prepared and portions are generous.  The drink menu is interesting and diverse.  Decor is nice and service was prompt and friendly.  The live music was a bonus.  I'd definitely recommend a visit.  Or more than one.  As for specifics, the chips come with a variety of salsas that range from fairly mild to quite spicy.  One had a garlic flavor that was amazing.  I, the one who leans away from spicy, kept going for two of the spicy varieties because the flavors were completely worth it.  We also ordered guacamole.  Great flavor and nice sized portion.  And more chips came along and were hot so I'm guessing they are not coming out of a bag.  We ordered a variety of tacos, all of which were good.  I found them a bit spicy but was able to eat them; flavors were really good.  The side of beans was good; the side of rice was superb (I'd opt for that next time, but got to taste my daughter's).  I heard her drink was strong and well mixed as well.  Cheers!",

That's a different story.  Like everything else in the restaurant, the menu looks like something you'd see in a great eatery.  You'll find street corn, creative aiolis, slow-cooked meats, pungent cheeses, and freshly made tortillas.  But the chef seems either unwilling or unable to properly use the tools at his or her disposal. I had street corn and the lamb and cherry steak tacos, each one of which was drenched in their homemade mayonnaise.  And in the case of the tacos, both were loaded with so much bleu cheese that I barely noticed the well-cooked and seasoned meats stuffed at the bottom of the tortilla.  This place has potential, but right now, it clearly misses the mark.",

Luckily, the food delivers, so you aren't just enjoying eye candy at Taco Guild.  I like that the tortilla chips are warm when they're served, and the accompanying salsa is fresh and delicious. My husband and I started with the Guild Duo - guacamole and queso. The queso was great, with fresh tomatoes and cilantro. The guacamole was good, though a little lightly seasoned for my personal taste. The portion size was big, though, so I can't complain too much.  We tried the guild chicken taco, vegetable taco, and molida lamb  taco. The chicken was really nice, with a touch of sweetness. I could see this becoming my favorite go to taco at Taco Guild. The veggie was great, with wonderfully seasoned vegetables. The molida lamb was rich and delicious. Make sure you like blue cheese before ordering this, and I would suggest only ordering one because it's rich and heavy. The lamb was moist and wonderful - really liked this taco. We also had the beer battered onion jalapeno straws, which were your standard fried goodness, but nothing spectacular to write home about. I think I'll try the corn next time.  I think the prices were pretty reasonable, and the service was good. Parking was easier than I thought it would be. I would forgo turning in from Osborn but instead turn in from 7th St behind Taco Guild and Starbucks.  I will definitely be back to try more tacos.",

The waitress was good but the manager cut us off at 3 beers in. We asked for the manager but he never came to talk to us. After we asked for him it seemed like the staff became rude towards us. We had a birthday party there but never will again. This place used to be a regular place for me and 6-8 others but this Diminished Any Chance Of Returning. You Would Think Spending $400 or so per visit with my triends and family would be worth respect from the Manager. So To Say The Least Worst Experience Ever.",

The Peking taco is the opposite of what it says. It's full of beef with a few duck strips on it. Also, the tacos are not nearly as good as a taco truck at 2.95 a taco not worth the money.

Great place to grab happy hour with co-workers or friends.",

    "text": "We've been coming to this place for three years and don't plan on stopping anytime soon. As such, we figured it was finally time to drop a review! Over the past three years, Taco Guild has become our go to spot for everything including anniversaries, graduations, date nights, birthdays, finishing exams, hosting family when they visit, Friday's, basically we look for any excuse to go here. The building itself is awesome, being a converted church. When you go to this restaurant you feel like you're in old world Spain. All of the decor and furniture is beautiful wood and there are amazing mural paintings on and around the ceiling. When we found out the owner was from Ocean Beach, CA we knew this place was going to be legit. The menu has something for everyone with a large selection of tacos of different flavors, as well as side dishes and non-taco items such as burritos and enchiladas. The place also has a great drink menu with lots to choose from. Staff is always very friendly and service is great. Sometimes there's even live music in the restaurant.  Naty (The Veggie Perspective): I have grown to love this place so much that I even had my med school grad party there LOL. You can make anything on the menu vegetarian basically, and the veggie taco that's already on the menu is amazingly flavorful and unique. I typically judge Mexican restaurants on the quality of their chips and salsa, and theirs are the BEST. The chips are thin, crunchy and usually still hot from being freshly made. Their salsas are sooo good, and they bring you a plate of 4 different kinds so you can't go wrong. Also I definitely appreciate that they don't judge us when they end up repeatedly bringing us refills of chips/salsa like 5 times during our meal because we inhale it so fast....(sorry not sorry, it's just that good).  Drew (The Omnivore Perspective (I Eat it All): I've had almost every taco on the menu and they're all pretty awesome. My go to's are usually the guild chicken, pork al pastor, and the Urban Bean beef taco. The veggie taco is also pretty good. Their salads are also great, and the cilantro lime dressing is life changing. The drink menu is also delicious and unique for those that like to partake. I particularly like the Jalisco Mule, since I love Moscow Mules. This drink is basically a Mule with added tequila.  N&D: Dude we've been coming here for 3 years, and go at least once a month...what more do you need to know?",

I read reviews and prepped myself for what I thought was going to be the best taco experience I've had in Phoenix.   I ordered the cherry steak as suggested, my favorite al pastor, and the ono cause I wanted to have a fish taco. I also got the street corn as my side.   The tacos all were bland and the tortilla overpowered them. I did however love the street corn. I got it in a cup not on the cob.   The building is a good reason to go try this spot but that's about where my enjoyment ended. Sadly I doubt I'll be back.",

One of the fun and awesome parts of a visit to Taco Guild was the fun cocktail menu.  The format and drinks were very clever, church themed and great tasting!!  I brought a different group with me on Christmas Eve to find the cocktail menu (book) is gone and so are all of the fun cocktails...what!?!?!?  This was one of the things that made Taco Guild unique and really fun to bring a group of friends to try the various church themed drinks.  The food is still fantastic and I love the building, but part of the draw and fun of Taco Guild is gone.  Why did they do this????  Please bring back the fun drink book!!",

My fiance and I went in on a busy \"Taco Tuesday\" and all couples had a 45-50 minute wait. They should definitely expand their area because they were obviously a hit!! Once we were seated our waitress, Lauren, was immediately attentive and very friendly. She brought menus, took drink orders, & came back with chips and salsa in no time. I loved the variety of salsas they offer!!  Once our drinks were being served, we were already ready to order. Our food came out promptly and perfectly. I attempted to take a photo of my steak tacos because they were AMAZING and I wish I could've shared with y'all, but my phone had other ideas. The waitress stayed on top of refilling our drinks & we even ordered more food =) If you have a craving for tacos and a chance to stop by this spot, you won't regret it!! Yummm",

The building is an old Methodist Church which has been converted into a cool restaurant space with some articles of the original church and unique lighting and a very impressive chandelier in the center.   We began our food journey at the Taco Guild with chips, salsa and guacamole. The chips were warm and crisp, the guac was tasty and good-we added a bit of salt to bring it up a bit. The salas were really great--but HOT!  We are salsa people but were going light due to the heat of these three salsas.  Note, the tacos are not your standard traditional fare, unique combinations and flavors make for tacos you're likely to remember and be amazed by.  We each ordered three and found that to be about right for dinner. I had the duck, cherry steak and shrimp.  Each was incredible, lots of flavor, texture and taste.  Service was fast and our server was very friendly and helpful.    When in Phoenix-check out the Taco Guild.",

We ordered jalapeno margaritas, the cheese dip, three tacos, and the corn on the cob and everything was out of this world. Our waitstaff was absolutely amazing , the atmosphere of this spot was really cool and I can't wait to go back next time I'm visiting!!",

    "text": "I have fallen in love! We were hesitant to try this place despite the unique theme, only because it did seem very hipster-y. Parking was a little bit of a hassle but at a certain time they do have complimentary Valet so you're not having to continuously circle the tiny lot. It was a matter of, should we stay or should we go, but finally someone left and we snagged a spot. I was actually pretty excited to try this place, had a craving for tacos and all the pics on yelp looked super delicious.   The inside wasn't that packed, they had at least 10 tables in the front open area inside but the waitress wanted to stick us in the dark library room in the back. Felt it odd because being our first time that's partly why you come here, for the experience. We simply asked to sit in the open area so we could see everything and they happily accommodated. We joked that maybe we weren't hipster enough to sit with the cool kids but it could be they try to put tables of two in the very back, who knows.   The menu was a little daunting, I'm not opposed to new foods and combinations, but I also like simple ingredients. When I read a menu and it sounds like a chef on one of those cooking shows describing a dish with things I've never heard of...I get lost and it's hard to imagine what even sounds good when I can't process all of these ingredients coming together.  HOWEVER, I was proven wrong as each dish from the salsa to the entree. First off they serve chips and a sampling of salsa. Chips were perfectly thick, crispy and just enough salt. Their salsas are made in house and their main is super flavorful, I forgot to ask if they sold it to-go I wanted to take some home. We also tried their guacamole, super fresh, a light sprinkling of flavor that didn't mask the nice big chunks of avocado.   I had the Taco Trio with the side of Corn. The tacos are about the size of your palm. The pics make them look larger but they are actually more like street tacos, small in size but BIG in flavor and you will get full. These were a big surprise, the flavor combinations were out of this world! I got the Guild Chicken, Pork adovada, and Veggie tacos, all of them got me trying ingredients I don't particularly enjoy on their own or would never try, but together they were delicious, one bite and my eyes perked up from amazement. The mango relish and even the vegetables, never thought I'd like cucumber but the way they put it together...I'm craving it now.   Lastly the best part, the street corn! Holy hell! No pun intended, it was literally the first thought in my mind when tasting how delicious it was. I'd actually recommend getting this \"off the cob\" they cut it for you and put it in a small bowl but you get all the juices after. The habanero butter, chipotle mayonnaise, Cotija cheese melt together and you kinda get this delicious soup after that I used to drizzle on the taco remnants. I was so full but the corn was so good And I didn't know when I'd get a chance to return that I asked for another order. There's always room for more street corn.   I don't think there is anything I could truly find fault with this place, the food was absolutely amazing I just wish it was closer to the west side. I can't wait to go back!",

It was also the only service they gave us.  We sat for a good 30 minutes waiting to have our order taken and no one even tried approaching us. We eventually left and no one said a word, including the hostess who had sat us 30 min prior. Maybe in the future I'll try here again, but it won't be any time soon.",

Built for a choir and sounds great.  Chips are light and salsa top notch, thin with a bite. Not thick and clumpy.  The Taco trio with free side was really good.  Although not on the menu, they have a flour less chocolate cake that is yummy and again not on the menu, they will do a flight of mescal for you.  Make sure you're not driving after.  Soooo much fun!!!",

And on top of the wonderful food, the restaurant offers complimentary valet. I would absolutely recommend Taco Guild if you're in the Downtown Phoenix area.  The only 'con' is that the inside seating is very loud (because the restaurant is in an old church). Ask to sit outside on the patio - there are misters and cute lights.  :)",

    "text": "This was a perfect place to celebrate Cinco de Mayo last night! We decided we would arrive about 445pm to attempt to  settle in before the celebratory rush would ensue..  and somehow as our luck was with us!.. Our party waited less than 20 minutes for a table! After that! The queue to get in was very long! I had forgotten how lovely this place is on the inside. The old church windows and some having excerpts from the Bible give it a very eclectic feel. The decor is just so cool and you find yourself looking around at all the windows and ceilings and murals! We were sat in the back room of the building and immediately there were chips and a variety of salsas on the table; waters too! I like that. In my previous review, I noted not liking the chips and salsas, but tonight I loved them! The variety of the salsas ranged from hot, to one that was a bit fruity, to a more chunky, garlic version. Happy hour here is great! Tonight was special drink that was a Paloma type cocktail with grapefruit; champagne; cerveza and Roger Clyne tequila.. and a wedge of grapefruit too.. fruity and fresh for $5. The management of Taco Guild was having a cool little contest for anyone who took part in this fresh libation: name the drink and if your entry is chosen, get a $50 Taco Guild gift card. In! Thats a few tacos and margs! Speaking of margs! The 1893 Margarita is their version of a 'house' margarita. $5 on happy hour! AND, its really, REALLY good! NOT too sweet and not too tart. I asked if this was smaller than the regular menu one, that is still a great deal at a $7.98, and our waiter said they were the same size. Happy Hour Monday thru Friday is 400-700pm. There is also a reverse happy hour later at night AND on weekends.. MOST of the day. Can anyone say, \"Sunday Funday?!\" The Brunch Menu looks fab and so do the Brunch Cocktails. Breakfast Beer?!   The 'Daily Taco' is a daily unique street taco of greatness available during the weekday from 300-700p and late night for a cool $1.99! Because this was Cinco de Mayo, we started with a round of drinks for all in our party and some starters: The Guild Duo: Housemade, fresh guacamole and amazing green chile queso that comes served warm over a tea light.. like a fondue. Seriously so good! We also started with the Diablo Eggs: Taco Guilds spin on a deviled egg that has a bit of serrano pepper, truffle oil and topped with a longaniza sausage to give it just enough kick. You get an ample serving of six of these! So, so tasty! Because this was my cheat day, I was seriously about to cheat my way through this with carbs and tequila! My entree was the Chicken Enchiladas. These enchiladas were so FULL of chicken and goodies that I was full half way through the first one and ended up giving my husband the other one! House made corn tortillas are filled with annatto braised shredded chicken, just enough jack cheese, green chile and tomatillo sauce. They are topped off with a bit of cojita cheese and corn and a drizzle of sour cream. The beans that are served with these are out of this world; NOT refried! This super filling entree is just under $10! I also had to try the Daily Taco. I can not tell you what it is! Not because I had a margarita, (okay, I actually had two!), but because even after I asked our waiter to repeat it twice, I could not remember! It was shredded pork and it was marinated in tequila! That's all I needed to know. Super delicious. Despite the fact that was a crazy, busy day for any restaurant serving tacos and tequila.. our waiter did not try to 'churn and burn' us out the door. We were given fresh chips and more salsa to go with the numerous drink orders coming from our group. He never let our waters go dry and apologized for the 'wait' , (not really a wait, at all!), for our drinks since it was Cinco de Mayo. The live music started in the bar around 5pm and it made the ambiance a lot of fun!  I decided to delve into the history of Taco Guild after dining here last night . The Taco Guild building history is pretty neat!  Fun Fact: The lot that the Taco Guild sits on was purchased for $30 to build a church. When construction began in 1893, it evolved into a one room schoolhouse named Osborn School. A year later it opened as a church and remained that way until 2012 when the property was deconsecrated. Taco Guild uses local farms for its produce for freshness and flavor.  The use of 'up cycled' plates kind of goes along with the history of the building and what you have when you dine here :  a story. This is the downtown place for trend, mixed with history, great service and amazing food and drinks!",

Came to you with all my friends and you tossed us some shots You tossed us some shots, you did To give me all your love is all I ever asked Cause what you don't understand is  I tried the Taco Guild for ya Throw my name on your place for ya I'll Bo Bites my reviews for ya You know I'd try anything for ya  Taco's in a church!?  This I had to try!  I came with my running gang to celebrate a birthday.  At first sight the place was pretty enclosed with some stained windows around.  High vaulted ceilings and the bar is up front where the altars would be.  This place was pretty cool in my book!  Complimentary chips and salsa at the start.  It was a hefty size and perfect with 4 different salsas to dip.  I ordered the Chorizo Meatballs to start.  Doused with sweet pear sauce it had a tad bit of kick as you chewed through the soft and warmly served meatballs.  For my tacos I shot for the Al Pastor Pork, Urban Bean Coffee Braised Beef, and the Chipotle Cherry Steak.  My favorite was probably the Al Pastor Pork; topped grilled pineapple, jalapeno bacon, and pickled red onions.  I didn't really care much for the Coffee Braised Beef though it did sound fun.  It was topped with caramelized onions, mango jicama relish, and cotija cheese.  The Chipotle Cherry Steak again sounded fun, but was okay at best.  It was topped with pablano straws, chile aioli, and bleu cheese.    Overall, the place was a delight and beautifully nestled into a church.  Live bands during the weekend and service was lovely.  In the end, I would rather much prefer my street tacos...Street, but this place is a still a cool place to hangout.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "This place was formerly a church now converted into the Taco Guild, making it a unique place to grab tacos and drinks.  The ceilings are high, and the windows have colored stained glass. In the center, there is a beautiful candle chandelier hanging from above. As I was walking in, the bar was located at the front. Two large TVs were playing near the bar. I immediately sensed the cool, pub-like ambience.   Arriving around 4pm on a Friday, there were plenty of seats around. The server let us pick our favorite spot. He immediately brought us complimentary chips, salsa, and 3 hot sauces.  We had fresh made guacamole to dip our chips. The guac had nothing special in terms of flavors; it's something I can easily make at home. We ordered at least 3 tacos to get a free side. The al pastor was my absolute favorite, and our server's favorite as well; everything was juicy and flavorful. I also enjoyed the pork adovada as the meat was very tender and delicious. The urban bean coffee braised beef was our least favorite since the beef was a little dry. Each taco was generously loaded with a lot of meat. It would have been perfect with a little more sauce and more toppings on the tacos. I'm not counting carbs, but I personally prefer double tortilla instead of the given one tortilla as it keeps the tacos intact better. It would be nice if they routinely provided lime on the side instead of the customers requesting them. The side of veggies did not have much flavoring, so expect it to be plain vegetables.   Service was wonderful. Our water was refilled in a timely manner.  They also serve a lot of delicious mixed drinks on the menu. I shall return.",

If you like overly spicy food and and very alcoholic sangria, then you probably would give it more than 2 stars.  I am giving it 2 stars because my salad (even though it was overdressed) it tasted yummy and it was fun to checkout the decor. Good thing my husband gave me the heads up about the bathrooms (how much louder the music was in the bathroom), otherwise would have given 1 start instead.",

Service during their peek lunch and dinner hours can be somewhat slow but their tacos are worth the wait.

And the lighting decor in middle was a nice touch.  We came here for taco tuesday. Weeeeeeee. COMPLIMENTARY CHIP AND SALSA. Yummmmm. The sauces were really good. I had the 3 tacos and corn on the cob on the side. Oh my goodness. It was a lot of food. On my three tacos I had 2 with vegetables that had zucchinis and bell peppers and the third taco was with rice and beans. It was mediocre.. I had to add hot sauce for flavor. They added too much cheese in it. Especially my corn. Ekkkkk. I had to scoop it off. :/   The server didn't ask me if I wanted corn or flour tortilla.. so I had to flag him down to ask. No biggie.  I'd come back....for chip and salsa :D",

Once the waiter did come to our table, we asked that he summon the manager to our table so we could air our grievances.  She arrived at our table and we explained our dilemma.

    "text": "Wanting to get out of Scottsdale for a change a friend of mine recommended Taco Guild. Wow! Can't believe I've not heard or been yet before to this unique gem!   Located in a former decommissioned church the decor instantly catches your attention. This is unlike any other dining ambiance.  Stained glass and vaulted ceilings still remain and add to the allure.   I laughed out loud when I was presented by my server with 'The bible'.  Which is their separate menu of 100's of varieties of tequilas. I opted for 2 separate tequilas that the server recommended. Both were fabulous!  After that I went with their margarita with a mescal topper, which I have had previously at higher end Mexican restaurants.  Mescal adds a touch of smokiness to the margarita and takes sourness down just a touch. Highly recommended for my fellow margarita connoisseurs.   The chips came with 3 varieties of all hot goodness, which I love.   Tacos were phenomenal, steak and shrimp! Definitely had zing!    I'm literally debating driving over there right now just writing this review... It's making my mouth water and stomach growl! Maybe I'll see you there as I plan on numerous future visits!",

The menu is small, but of course most people are going to order the tacos.   We had the guacamole for a starter, can't complain! I love guac and it was yummy! For dinner, I tried the yucatan shrimp, chipotle cherry steak, and urban bean coffee braised beef tacos. My favorite was the chipotle cherry steak - it was a unique flavor combination, but completely worked! My friend had the enchiladas and was very happy with the dish. It was a decent sized portion with a great flavor.  I also tried one of the margaritas, it was pretty strong, but still tasted yummy! Definite win!  I would  go back.",

We sat at a high-top table in the bar area, and were served very quickly.  I tried the classic margarita and was not disappointed at all.  It tasted very fresh and not margarita-mix like. I enjoyed the elote, guacamole, and the al pastor tacos. The food was not as memorable as the margaritas though.  Not sure if that means that the drinks were just that amazing or if they were just really strong :)   Next time I am in the Phoenix area I will definitely be back again.",

Outstanding tacos and other delicacies with the only problem being there are so many great choices, you'll be full before you can try too many. The street corn is a must-try.  It's on the cob and on the mark for best side dish ever.  The tacos are nice and hearty, so two should suffice unless you're super hungry.      It's almost impossible to do, but save room for dessert. The Coconut Cream pie is outstanding.  The Prickly Pear sorbet was also refreshing and had great flavor - not overly sweet.    The atmosphere is beyond hip and cool - it's an old repurposed church.  The service is fast, friendly and efficient.  Prices are reasonable too - Hallelujah! I've found a church I'll frequent.",

Located in the shopping complex right across the street from Urban Beans, Taco Guild definitely delivers on personality upon first glance. With a high chandelier and stained glass windows, as well as wallpapered pictures of characters during times long ago, you feel like you've just stepped into a time warp situation. The menu includes delicious tacos with large helpings, and if you order three you have a choice of an appetizer or Street Corn. Please go with the Street Corn! The Chipotle mayo is divine and it is some of the best corn you will ever taste! The tacos we ordered included a range of meats and we sampled half of the menu, with the most notable being Urban Bean Coffee Braised Beef. Each taco had its own unique flavors, but this one stood out amongst the rest because the beef was very juicy and paired well with the mango relish and cojita cheese. For drinks, they offer tequila samples, and although I passed on that the tequila based drink I ordered was very smooth. Their beer selection was average so I recommend anything with tequila to pair with the drinks, tasted much better. Finally, can't complain about the customer service either. We came during lunch time on a weekday and Eric, the bartender, took great care of us! We can't wait to come back!",

Enjoy a casual Sunday Brunch with a beverage of choice in an old Methodist church, really!  The menu selection offers choices between old world cuisine or new world cuisine.  No matter your preference the flavors are delicious and the portion sizes won't put you on the couch for the rest of the day.  The food was hot and flavorful with a depth of spices that most would appreciate. Although the brunch crowd hasn't picked up that much yet, the ambiance was unique and I liked the ability to have a conversation with my guests without too much noise.  Their location near a light rail stop makes it easy to get to and enjoy the mimosas and Bloody Mary's without concern.  Enjoyed visiting with the manager as he explained the history and vision behind opening a restaurant in an old church.  It just works!  Amen.",

Huge stained glass windows and they carried the design through with the tables and candelabras. Nice.   My burrito was totally great! Loved it! The salsa selection was fun, but the main salsa was too watery. Our server, Joshua was terrible! Very disengaged. He was way more interested in talking with his co-workers than serving tables. Ten or more minutes after saying he'd get more water, I finally went to the bar for it. That is just one example of how lame he was. BUT, go to Taco Guild, just make sure you don't have Joshua!  Food great! Atmosphere greater! Service terrible at best, but need to give it another try!",

    "text": "Cool place. Inside of an old church. First time I went I was impressed. Good drinks, good food, excellent service. Second time couldn't have been more opposite. Service was garbage from the jump. First guy said he'd be back with chips salsa and water. Five minutes later he strolled right by our table with chips salsa and water and went to another table. Then a new server came up and asked if we were ready to order. I said I'd like the chips salsa and water to start. She came back with chips and salsa, no water. She took our drink order, ten years later she came back with them. They were decent, not as good as the first time I'd been there. My first time we sat inside and the server Jen was awesome. Acted as though we were friends, told us a bit about the old church, told us her favorite drinks, her favorite tacos. Told us about there salsas and how they're made. Super friendly without being over bearing, and on top of shit(and it was a busy Friday night). She get 10 stars herself.  This second time we sat outside, and that must be where they have the dum-dums work. Super slow, felt like we were totally forgotten, and there were other guests outside too. Drinks took forever, when I looked inside I saw our server chillin, flirting with the guy at the front entry, not doing shit.  When drinks came I said it'd be nice to get that water we were told about. Drinks were ok, not as good as before. Ordered our food, took forever. When it came mine was as advertised, but my girlfriend who ordered the Al Pastor tacos(grilled pineapple, jalapeno bacon, pickled onion, pork) had just pork and onions on it, WTF!! I told the server and she tried some bullshit line that the pork is actually cooked with pineapple and bacon flavors. I stopped her mid sentence since I figured this would be her logic. I told her I'd been here recently and ordered the same thing and it came with all the stuff it described. She look perplexed(I'm guessing that's normal). She took it off the bill though, so that was one thing she managed to not screw up.  Second round of drinks took forever again, so we decided to settle up the bill. At this point I'm still planning on tipping 20% like I always do(I've served tables myself, I know the struggle). But it took longer to settle the bill than it did to suffer through this shitty dining experience. She was no where to be found. I pulled some dude in that worked there to have him do it. Then she magically appeared, and then took forever to come back with my card. I put up with slow shitty service, the sloppy lazy kitchen, dehydration, and now I gotta wait 30 freaking minutes just to pay and leave. Now she's getting stiffed. She got 2 bucks on a $70 ticket, and we wanted to spend more, we were out to get lit up and blow money. I've never stiffed before and hopefully never will again but this was ridiculous.  Consistency is what carries a good restaurant. If I go one time and I'm impressed, and I tell my girlfriend about it all week, we go and get shit on, I'm never going back again. Too many other options, especially in Phoenix.  Step your game up Taco Guild. If you go, sit inside, hopefully you get Jen who waited on us the first time, otherwise good luck!!! I'd like to have given a 1 star, or none at all. But the first time was really cool.",

It's an old church and it has lots of original stained glass (from what I saw) and a badass chandelier globe made of wrought iron. The bar is equally visually appealing with iron and wood.   The drinks are definitely well assembled but not very strong. I asked for a cucumber gimlet at the bar and they more or less understood the instructions. Points for effort (drinks still 3/5).  Food was hit and miss. Grilled corn app was delicious. Tacos were all over. The lamb was excellent and their pork tacos are both solid but their Yucatan shrimp and thai curry snapper were both 2/5. I got nothing uniquely Spanish or thai out of those last two, respectively. These are back to the drawing board tacos IMO.   Overall a solid place but nothing that really blew me away. I might come back if I hear some fellow yelpers giving updates but for now it's a one and done for me.",

The salsas were okay, good for Phoenix standards but I've had better in SD. I'll be coming back for more tacos and tortilla chips (which sprinkled with lemon and salt are heavenly).",

The atmosphere is really unique here, converted from an old church. Its a wonderful clash of old and new.  The free chips they serve you while you wait come with an assortment of salsas. Ranging from guacamole dip to a mango salsa with some heat. I ordered the special of the day ,orange glazed chicken tacos. Just wow, let me tell you, very very good. I got three of them, skipped dessert, and was more than full.   This is certainly a place that I will be revisiting. The service, atmosphere and food were all great. Next time I will probably get something a little different just to be adventuresome.",

    "text": "Sadly, the Ferrari of Minivans is no longer... she met an untimely demise a few weeks ago.   The whole famdam, including our St. Louis branch, decided tacos were in order before the St. Louians headed back home. We bandied about this place and that.. until mum (MUM!!!) suggested this gastropub. Natch, I've heard of it... just hadn't had time to venture down there from SoTem yet.  I'm firstly grateful that the historic old church building was saved from the wrecking ball and that Taco Guild left some of it's rustic charm in place. Who in their right mind would demolish stained glass?  I wouldn't go so far as to say this is a great place to bring kids, but we had a 5 y/o and a 2 y/o. The restaurant was more than accommodating, but the atmosphere is more grown up in nature. Not holding that against them.  Some of the famdam got the 1893 Margs (happy hour!) and said they were stupendous. We stuck with water... so we'll take their word.  The salsas... they give you FOUR... a big bowl of their house salsa that's on the mild side, with a slight kick and three small bowls of various other heat levels. I enjoyed every single salsa they had. Each had their own unique depth, flavor profile and heat level.  Our table also got an order of guac. It was a little \"too chunky\" and had to be hacked a little more, but the flavor was perfect; nothing missing.  Now for the tacos... they do not disappoint. I'm already plotting my next visit so I can try a couple of other meats. Several at our table got the coffee braised beef. It had a smooth, complex flavor to it - just like your favorite cup of coffee (not of the Char-Sucks variety). You can't \"taste\" coffee, but you know there's a smoothness to the flavor of the meat. A few of us also had the Adovada and that was incredibly flavorful and rich. There is no question every single taco filling is lovingly and artistically created by the chefs.   My husband also got the Cherry Steak which was a religious experience in and of itself. I could have rubbed it on my body and died happy. My sister got the Peking Duck and it was a shockingly pleasing flavor adventure. My brother had a shrimp taco and - while he said it was a little light on actual shrimp, the flavor of it was spot on.   These tacos are amazing. Again - I can't wait to go back and try some more.",

    "text": "Upon arriving we were seated promptly and that's where all the good parts about this trip stopped.  Our waiter took no less than 15 minutes to get to our table to get our drink orders.  But before our drink orders came (other than water) he asked us if we were ready to order.  We purposely spaced out our appetizer and entrees so we were sure to get our appetizer first (We told him we needed another minute we really didn't we were famished and tired of waiting but we just know if we didn't we would get everything at the same time).  Our drinks took 20 minutes to get to the table after they were ordered.  At that time we placed an order for our entrees they came out within another 10-15 minutes when we told him we never got our appetizer he bragged and said \"Yeah food comes out pretty fast here.\" So we just struck the appetizer from the bill and told them not to bother.  The food was generic fare but for the price you'd think there was something I was missing it's completely ho-hum not innovative or cutting edge (There's literally a thousand taco places within a stones throw of this location)  And the thing that really ate at me about this is how they tried to paint themselves as some trendy upscale hipster hangout even dubbing it as a \"Gastropub\" well Gastropub.. I ordered a beer I ordered a 10% Double IPA not only did they serve it to me in a shaker pint glass (that was also dirty as the lacing only stuck to one side)   first of all anyone who orders a premium beer of any kind should get a proper glass not to mention something that's high gravity!? They have an extensive beer selection and yet still serve these massive high gravity premium aromatic beers in pint glasses.  This isn't a VFW in the midwest  slinging Bud Light this is an establishment painting itself as a premium restaurant there is no excuse for not providing a premium experience!  The main takeaways are this: Slow, unprofessional and boring.  There is no shortage of good places to eat in the valley so there's no reason to put up with mediocrity.",

It was a dj who was dj-ing music which was odd as the place isn't really that kind of place.  No dancing was going on, and I requested to sit as far away as possible and found myself screaming \"what?!\" about fifty times.  We eventually just gave up and ate without talking.  But we had to listen to top 40 crap music.  Seriously, don't talk about authenticity and then blast autotuned music in my ears.  All in all, the food was good, the place really nicely decorated, but not at all a relaxing dinner out.  I went in the afternoon with someone else prior to this and it was very nice...maybe just avoid weekends?  I want to eat and chat with friends, not listen to a dj and sit in relative silence.",

Pretty much everything is a disaster... from high-top stools designed by Torquemada, to the brazenly over priced drinks fetched by surly independently wealthy cocktail servers.  Our server looked like a lumberjack, yet acted like Serge from Beverly Hills Cop.    I had two tacos, \"torn lettuce cups.\"  What I got was half a head of wet butter lettuce with a neat tablespoon of sodium soaked protein in the middle.  The pork adobo was indistinguishable from the coffee braised brisket.  Truly stunning for $3.95 EACH.  I have eaten more satisfying fare out of an MRE packet.    It is loud inside, which amplifies the horrific choice to put a jukebox in a restaurant.  There is a ton of service staff, none of which will make eye contact with a patron begging for a drink.    The chips were fresh and crunchy, and the salsas offered were not bad.  Perhaps that merits the single star I was forced to give.",

Now I love the food enough to endure this, but I've stood at the door so many times to the point it was awkward I had to stop someone to get seated. I've also been told they were on a wait while I could see open tables and simply needed to get somebody else to get a table.  On a sidenote the jukebox can be a blessing or curse. Lots of horrible music but they also have old soul music like Joe Tex on it. My advice is take it over early if you're going to stay for a while.",

    "text": "This would be a 5-star review if I left out the food.  I love the building, the decor and the layout.  It is a bit loud and the waitstaff seems to wander a bit without real direction.  We were so looking forward to having a great new lunch spot near our office.  After our dining experience we have no plans to return.    The food looked great... But it didn't taste great.  That's a real problem for a restaurant to overcome.  I did not enjoy any of the things I tried.  I had three different types of their tacos and only ate half of each.  The coffee beef was the worst.  The shrimp was the best of the three but again, wasn't great.  Heck, it wasn't even good or I would have polished it off.  The beans tasted as though they came out of a can and were off-brand.  The corn was probably the best thing we ate (besides the chips--but how do you screw up chips?).  When my parents came to town recently I took them there to show them the building.  My Mom was very excited and wanted to eat there and I dissuaded her based upon my experience.  There had better be some HUGE changes in their kitchen ASAP or there will be no hope for their future.  Great name but they don't deserve it!",

    "text": "These are some of the best tacos I've ever had. Reasonably priced with tons of different options that vary between traditional Mexican favorites like Pork Al Pastor, chicken, and coffee braised beef. If you're feeling adventurous don't be nervous to try the Molida Lamb or Peking Duck! The service is friendly and fast, and people always come by to fill up your water and get you more chips and salsa. The salsa comes on a sampler platter of sorts that ranges from a traditional tomatoes based salsa to a mango/habanero salsa. All on the house including refills. If you get the taco plate, be sure to pay the extra 3 bucks for the Street Corn, which is freshly grilled corn cut off the cob mixed with chipotle cream and cotija cheese. Go during happy hour to get $6 margaritas that will beat any other margarita available at that price. This is foodie food for sure. And enjoying it while hanging out in an old church converted to taco bar just seals the deal as one of the best restaurants in PHX. Only issue is parking, but Taco Guild is worth running a marathon for, let alone dealing with bad parking.",

The first thing you absolutely notice when you walk in is that this place looks like an old church. And that's because..... SURPRISE! It is! They have amazing stained glass windows, high ceilings, and anything else you could think you might need to have a religious experience involving tacos.  We ordered a few tacos, street corn, some guac and queso (which I remember coming as a duo appetizer type thing). Everything was delicious, albeit somewhat unconventional. Who knew peking duck would be so delicious in taco form?! The coffee braised beef taco was also delicious. I remember we had a taco of the day as well - it was alright - nothing worth writing home about but not bad by any means.   The real standout was the STREET CORN. Granted grilled corn is always a winner in my book. But whatever they smear and drizzle all over the top really makes it outstanding.  Overall we were quite pleased. It was a pricier than other happy hours I've been to with similar menu options, but none of us left feeling dissatisfied.  Raise your corn cob in the air and pray to the peking duck taco gods!",

It's an old church, although you can drink yourself silly if you choose. We had their fish tacos. For lunch, the prices were good for larger than street size tacos. Plenty of fish bites in the tacos. 2 each were enough. It came with a side of beans and rice, both also very tasty.  The food and service were great, but I wasn't impressed with the beer bloody Mary drink. I normally love bloody Mary's, but not this concoction.  So glad we found this place by a random drive by.",

Happy hour:   Ended at 7pm tonight, we got there in time for $2.50 daily taco, which was bbq pork. Got 4. So perfect. Juicy, and those crisps in it were delicious.  Appetizers:   Deviled eggs were made just right. The serano peppers is just blended into the yolk and it wasn't spicy. The sausage that came with it was overcooked and dry, but the eggs were the primary item and were great.  Meatballs were good. The sauce was just the right blend of sweet.   Chips: Crisp, not hard and thick like many Mexican restaurants. Salsas were great, came with a large mild dish, and 3 small cups of the spicier salsas.  Verdict: Will definitely go again.  It was a Thursday and packed up just before 7pm. Seating smaller than most places. Not sure if they take reservations.",

It's definitely a trendy atmosphere.  We sat in the back room that is a little smaller and quieter so we could have a conversation. Obviously tacos are the star of the show here, but I decided to get the grilled Romaine salad - pretty good, perhaps a little too much dressing. It's a big portion.  Also got a Lamb taco to get my protein and that was fantastic, very flavorful.  Service was very attentive even when it started to get very busy about noontime. All in all, a nice lunch but I'm sure there are more standout tacos in the Phoenix area so I might try something different next time.",

    "text": "This is one of, if not the best restaurant I've been to since moving out to Arizona 3 years ago.  The service, the food, and the atmosphere all get 5/5 stars.  Trish is a great manager and I constantly saw her helping out waiters/waitresses and the bus boys with their tasks while the dinner rush was still dining.  Jon was our server and he was extremely helpful with recommendations and provided great service.  I recommend any of the margarita flavors and especially the chipotle cherry steak tacos as far as an entree goes.  You will not be disappointed.  Live music on Friday's and Saturday and the guy they had Saturday was great.  The building is equally great to look at and the renovations to make the church into a pub/restaurant were extremely well done.  My wife and I live in Mesa and I'd rather make the 25-30 minute drive to Phoenix to eat here than most places by us.",

I tried the street corn and the 3 taco sampler (shrimp, roasted veggies, and fish).  While these were all good, I don't understand how this place earned the reputation for being one of the best taco places in Phoenix.  Yes, the restaurant itself is interesting.  However, the food wasn't any better or worse than any other so-called modern gourmet street taco places.  Would I return?  Sure.  It is a neat place.  However, don't expect to be absolutely blown away by a delicious and unique menu.",

    "text": "Good food, good choice of tequila, fun atmosphere, but it is noisy as heck. I mean at times its just down right loud and you really cannot expect to have a conversation across the table. Its inside an old church and given that they kept the interiors as is to a very large extent I do not think the acoustics do not lend itself to playing R'n'B or techno or anything at that volume that the music is currently played at least.   Now that I am done complaining about what is wrong, what is good is the drinks. The selection of tequila is extensive enough to keep me from complaining and that takes a lot. The service is fast and the bartenders are fun and great to talk to and do not rush you when eating at the bar. The tacos are good, but not necessarily make me want to go back right now kinda great. The chips and salsa is also pretty legit and happy hour prices are well the kind that make you happy.  Regular prices are I believe about a 150% more (2 vs 5$) and I have pretty much never been here at any other time, so take the taco pricing at face value.",

    "text": "Came here on a Sunday afternoon. The place was moderately busy but we came in the early afternoon so not quite dinner time yet. I will start off with the pros. Chips were amazing. My wife and I literally went through 3 bowls of chips before the meal was over. Salsas were decent. I liked their house salsa and the other 3 were unique. Service was also very good.   Now on to the cons. Overall, tacos were very unimpressive. I feel like they are trying to do way too much with their tacos. I feel like the idea is there but the execution was lacking. I had the vegetable taco, al pastor, and the pork adovada. All of them were either lacking in flavor or were spiced too heavily. For example, it tastes like they put a lot of cinnamon in the pork adovada which would be good, but it was just way too much of that flavor. I got flour tortillas which are supposedly homemade but you could have fooled me with that one. Best taco they had was their daily taco it was a smoked chicken taco with a mustard aioli and coleslaw. That one was really good. The side of rice literally had no flavor, super bland and it tastes like they didn't even put salt in it.   I most likely won't return. Their deviled eggs did sound good, but now I don't know if I will return to try them.",

The atmosphere was beautiful, with its tall vaulted ceilings and frescoes painted on the walls, the full bar is majestic, making you forget that for decades this building was an ugly rectangular church.   Oh and you cant forget that the outside looks like a gdam castle!   Those are the only good things I can say about this place. The menu is small and the food is bland, made with seemingly store bought materials and lacking any flavor. The drinks are over priced and the waite staff seems dead inside, at least each time I've come in.  All in all its a cool place to point out to people, maybe even to grab a drink, but definitely not worth getting food. Especially not when Gadzooks is across the street, amazing, and cheap!",

We came in the afternoon and had no problem getting a table for four. Service was good and friendly. Tacos were just okay. We each selected two and stuck to that for the other two places we hit. I had the shrimp and the lamb. Lamb was decent, but a little dry. Interesting flavor. The shrimp was very bland. Shrimp doesn't have a lot of flavor to begin with so I was expecting something to give it some staying power but there just wasn't anything there. Others in my party were pretty much the same with their selections - one so so and one ok-decent. Worth a stop in, but not sure the building is enough to get me back considering the other options around.",

We were told we got lucky and a long table at the entrance was just clearing out so we went outside to wait.  20 minutes later, we were seated.   Server came over to let us know it was still happy hour and took our drink order. We started with bundido and 2 orders of deviled eggs with chorizo on them. Both were good.  After seeing all the corn and taco pictures, we almost all had to try it. I also had the ceviche which I wouldn't recommend.  The chips are good but very oily. The salsas were all good. They gave a big bowl and 3 little ones with more flavor and heat.  Service was just super slow.  All the food came out separately. It took forever for 4 people to get their food and everyone had to start cause the corn was getting cold.   The last 2 guys got their food 15 minutes at least after everyone else.  Server said sorry but my corn also didn't come out.  Great on asking if we wanted more drinks but I felt bad for my birthday dinner guests who watched us eat.  The kitchen must-have been backed up.   The interior is beautiful in a side note. Old church with stained glass windows and beautifully decorated. Loved the wood benches and the owner or manager seemed to be at the front entrance trying to keep an eye on everything.  Would have been nice for him to stop by to at least say sorry for the delay.    They also have a patio that looked cute.  Located right next to a starbucks and they have valet parking in their lot.  Food is good. Service time was really bad thus just 3 stars. Definitely try the corn...it's great and even the soup was delish.",

    "text": "3rd time's a charm! First time I went with co-workers for lunch & it was amazing. Food & service were both great so a few weeks later we decided to go for happy hour. I was disappointed by the happy hour menu, not really a place to go for happy hour if you're looking for good deals. I also strayed from the margarita and wasn't happy with the vodka berry drink I got. Server was very accommodating & switched my drink out for margarita. Unfortunately the margarita tasked like sour mix with a drop of tequila. The food tasted like it was almost a completely different restaurant - the Guild Duo we got during lunch was amazing, unlike any other queso I'd ever had...not so much the 2nd time. First time at Taco Guild I got the guild chicken & seasonal veg tacos & they were both delicious. 2nd time Al Pastor & Guild Chicken but it just didn't taste as fresh and there was something else missing that was there the first time. The other difference was - first time we were seated in main restaurant area which has a really cool vibe but there is this overflow area that is slightly separated from the main restaurant &bar area. The room has 8-12 tables but it absolutely feels separate from main restaurant and when it got busy it felt like our server forgot about us. My third visit that room was my only complaint. I was the first and only person in that room while I waited for the rest of my party and I felt like an outcast. Everything else about that third visit was spot on. I told the server that last time I was in I wasn't thrilled with my margarita. He convinced me to try the frozen margarita  even after I told him I am not a fan of frozen. 100 times better than the other margaritas on the rocks I had tried the 2nd visit (too bad the frozen margarita isn't on happy hour menu). That same server convinced me not to exclude the blue cheese from the chipotle cherry steak tacos. I hate blue cheese but he was 100% right, there is just something about the combination that makes the blue cheese melt in with everything and enhances the flavor bit not with that typical blue cheese flavor that I'm not a fan of.  Also had pork adovada which was awesome. My guests, out of town consultants I was working with, truly enjoyed taco guild and vowed to be repeat customers when they return in a few weeks for our next set of meetings. They both loved the taco guild version of sangria which I wasn't a fan of but I didn't realize it was supposed to be a version of sangria since there really isn't any wine in it. ( it's berries vodka and something else that definitely isn't wine). The only other issues I have had at this restaurant is the servers really seem go get confused with table numbers in that back room and servers are very eager to take your order. During second visit we had at least 5 people try to bring us food that wasn't ours. Third and fourth visit servers tried to take our dinner order at least 6 times before we were ready (and 3 or 4 of those times were before we had our appetizers). Then  when we were ready to order our server was no where to be found. If they can figure that part out this is easily a 4 or 5 star review. Maybe I'll be able to update in 3 weeks when my office moves & Taco Guild becomes an after work meeting place!   *CHIPOTLE CHERRY steak poblano straws, chile aioli, Bleu cheese. 4.95 PORK ADOVADA mango jicama relish, avocado, cilantro. 3.95 AL PASTOR PORK grilled pineapple, jalapeno bacon, pickled red onion. 3.95 GUILD CHICKEN annatto-braised chicken, grilled corn, red bean pico, avocado, Cotija cheese. 3.95 GRILLED SEASONAL VEGETABLE fire-roasted peppers, roasted jalapeno hummus, Cotija cheese. 3.95",

    "text": "My wife and I just happened to be at Starbucks when we decide to try Taco Guild. Once arriving we were seated very quickly. Unfortunately it was at a table that hadn't  been cleaned (kinda gross if you'd ask me) which shows a lack of communication between who ever is cleaning the tables and who ever is sitting them (or they couldn't care less where they sat my wife and I). The tables and chairs are booth style so it was a bit uncomfortable for me. The server was very nice and greeted us very warmly. Unfortunately (and I might attribute this to a busy night on his end) we weren't really told about the menu. Once the waiter left my wife and I felt as if we knew nothing more about Taco Guild then when we sat down, this could have been excused if this places had been open for a couple of months but this was the third night it was opened. All in all the meal was great it came out quick and hot and the server seemed to have adjusted better and was accessible more and more throughout our meal. I recommend the Taco Guild the food was great at the atmosphere is killer and I'm very excited to see if there are any sports nights or weekends coming up at Taco Guild. If you're a selective eater please make sure to ask questions (next time I'll take my own advice as well). Please see below for a personal side note...  *The meal went fine and I seldom felt a I need to call my waiter over. As we were leaving a man which I presumed worked there (he was standing around looking at the tables and standing with the host and what I assumed to be the owner...or maybe he was the owner) went to the door and held it open. What I hadn't realized was that he was holding it open for a couple (white and in there 50's maybe) coming in and not for my wife and I (Hispanic and white respectably) which were going out. The man after noticing my wife and I motioning towards the door continues to motion the couple which was entering to come in. Awkward at best this situation left a poor taste in my mouth.",

The pastor is definitely the best, and from opinion of my other 10 coworkers, it was amazing. The corn was extremely delicious. I wish i had more but overall satisfied. It can be pricey but its worth it. Its definitely a cool concept and environment. I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I am not sure what the hype is all about, but this place was not very good. We were seated at one of the tiniest tables with no room for the silverware or plates of food. I dropped my silverware a few times during our dinner. They were closing pretty soon so they could have easily given us a bigger table since it wasn't occupied all night.  The chips and salsa were very good. The elote was really good. The guacamole was fresh and delicious. I will give this place two stars for those reasons.   However, the tacos that are actually mini tacos that are priced the same as regular sized tacos were awful. They were filled with dried meat and completely lacked flavor or spices. It was as if someone blindfolded the chef and told him to grab three ingredients and throw it in a taco and put it on the menu. The duck taco is literally fatty duck meat, and fatty pumpkin seeds. Throw something fresh on there to cut the fat of the duck off! All the tacos tasted the same. They were all equally bland. I would have been much happier going to Chipotle, sadly.   The service was also subpar. The waitress had poor time management skills when we were waiting for our credit card back and she spent 20+ minutes returning it. It literally takes two seconds to put a check on a table. I understand if you get caught up in stuff, but come on! I also let the manager know about our awful dining experience, and he told me that he would call me back. That was a month ago. And here I am writing this review because this is what happens when management doesn't take care of the issue at that moment. I would not recommend this place if you're looking for tacos. If you're looking for drinks and appetizers, go for it.",

The seasonal veggies are flavorful & locally grown. The service is on point too. Every time I come here, I am greeted promptly by an upbeat server that is down to earth & really knows their stuff. You can trust their recommendations, no doubt! And if you don't check out out for the tacos, go just to experience the rad architecture & art because it's an old cathedral.",

The Salty Chihuahua was a melted down grapefruit drink with salt rub against the rim.

I went shortly after they opened and it seemed they still had a few kinks to work out, but I know that is normal for any new spot so I will go easy with the criticism. It took up space in the old Methodist Church and maintained the beauty of the structure by repurposing the gorgeous old building instead of rebuilding it. The stain glass windows, giant chandeliers and alter bar truly are magnificent.   The tacos were gourmet street tacos and they were not bad, but for their price point I expected a little more. (Gallo Blanco knows what I'm saying, they've got it down). The chips were delicious but I have to admit the salsa reminded me that this is the child of Z'tejas. I like that they serve all local crafted beers, but I was disappointed there was not one Mexican beer on tap. Who wants to wash down a shot of tequila with an IPA?  The place is family style which I don't mind, but the table they sat us at was so cramped I barely had room to move. Also the brick walls and high ceilings really carry voices, and I had to shout through my meal to hear my bf (not the best thing when you are sitting next to 4 strangers).  The service was horrible, but I won't harp on that because they had just opened.   The valet service was atrocious, this has no impact on my review but hopefully they can get the feedback somehow. We went to get the car and it was raining, the valet wouldn't leave his post because he was waiting for another guy to come back, he wouldn't give us the keys because the car was parked across Osborn. We stood there for over 10 minutes in the rain. They weren't that busy, there was no rhyme or reason for this.   I will return and hope for a better experience (and maybe skip the valet), it really is a cool spot, and it just needs to work a few things out.",

Great location and well executed on the use of the church, makes the artisan guild concept really work. The \"duo guild starter\" is great for a party of three or four to start. Pray that you get sat in kutie-Kyle's section. This guy is heaven sent: sweet, sincere, efficient, and charming to boot. Take him up on the jalapeno bacon in the guacamole - delicious!  It's a loud place, has a juke box, and the acoustics of a church. So if you're old, lame, or kind of a \"stick in the mud\", probably not your scene. The night I went it was swarming with couples from the Biltmore and Arcadia area, followed by Melrose gayberhood crews and Roosevelt Hipsters came about 7ish - fun scene if you don't take yourself or religion too seriously.",

The salad was very bland...probably since it was made with iceberg lettuce. Green leaf lettuce or spinach would elevate this salad.

Parking is a bit tough but it's definitely worth stopping by and having at least one experience there. It's one of my top 5 favorite restaurants!",

They were not that great this time around. We did enjoy the chorizo meatballs and margaritas. From reading other reviews, it seems the food is not consistently great. Maybe different chefs and they don't follow the same recipe?",

Anyhow we visited on a Sunday night and were seated fairly quickly.  Then the waiting began.....no waiter/waitress....no menus....no water.  It started to get uncomfortable/irritating and my husband was on the verge of finding someone to wait on us.  I think it was the manager who finally came over and gave us menus and a water.  Not impressed at this point.  Yet, I was hopeful for he food.  We ended up getting a happy hour margarita and the guacamole/cheese dip duo for an appetizer.  We also both ordered two Daily Tacos for our meal.  As far as the food goes....the guac wasn't too flavorful but the cheese dip was delicious!  The tacos were cool/room temp and lacking flavor as well.  The margarita was decently strong...especially for happy hour.  So overall I'd give his place a grade of \"average\".  And I'm not sure I'd go back....maybe because the building was so cool and unique but I'm not sure that's really a reason to go again.",

    "text": "This place is alright. The food is slightly above mediocre for Mexican food. The best way to describe this restaurant is \"Gentrified Mexican Food.\" This does not compare with most street taco places, and the price is significantly more. When we were ordering the waitress said the tacos are \"slightly bigger than normal street tacos, so that is why they are around $5 per taco.\" The tacos were brought to us and they were very small, about a 4\" diameter tortilla. They are definitely trying to capitalize off of Mexican culture, without bringing the benefits of good food. Pick another place if you are wanting authenticity.",

I believe it was the manager that finally came and acknowledged us. He quickly looked for an open table and mentioned one open towards the back of the restaurant. He didn't even walk us to the table and instead chatted with another table before coming over and handing us the menu. 5 minutes go by, 10 minutes, almost 15 minutes later we finally asked a waiter if someone could take our order. Maybe we were forgotten since we were in the back, idk. Not sure why we didnt just walk out. He mentioned that our waitress was bringing us our chips and salsa and would take our order soon. She finally comes 2 minutes later and takes our order. We haven't even gotten water at this point.  They bring our food (chicken soup and 2 tacos) within a reasonable time after we order but I'm so hungry from all the waiting that I nearly finish the big basket of chips and salsa. Boo.   The soup was okay. It came in a cauldron-like bowl that is NOT ideal for soup. I had to bend the spoon for more convenience. The tacos were again average. Nothing special. If you want gourmet tacos, go to El Hefe on Mill. Our drinks were not refilled until after we finished our food. None of our dishes were taken away from our tiny table. Crappy service the entire night.",

I really enjoyed looking at the paintings on the wall and the cool chandeliers while waiting for my food. I always appreciate any place that gives you chips and salsa. The chips were a little salty for me, but I like the variety of dipping sauces and salsa for them. I ordered the three tacos plate with the red beans (which were delicious). My favorite was the Yucatan Shrimp. It was full of flavor and had a generous amount of shrimp in the taco. The Al Pastor Pork was good but I found the Guild Chicken just OK. I never know what to think of the prices of these street tacos. I think I'm used to getting $1 street tacos in Mexico where the whole point is good food at a cheap price. Majority of the places here in the U.S. I have visited (like Joyride) charge $4 to $5 a taco. I guess that is just how things are these days. Overall, I had great service and the food was pretty good. The story of why they named it Taco Guild is kinda cool and creative (on their website).",

When you walk in, they have the place somewhat gutted with the exception of some of the pews left as aisles.   Now, in our case, we went with a party of 10 and our server was new, so we had a few rough spots. One being, we ordered drinks that were missing, and food that didn't get put in.   However, the food was phenomenal. I had the steak tacos and I could have eaten 1394723 more. We also got drinks, We had mescal mules and they were also great. Not to mention, the manager/owner came over and had us try some $1300 tequila, told us all the history of it, etc. and there was live music that was REALLY good!  I would definitely recommend this place to smaller parties, or dates. It is worth the price and they have done a great job.",

The food is not bad by any means, it was quite good actually. However, it was lacking spices and wasn't that authentic tasting. I did love the corn on the cob that they serve though!

I tried the ceviche first...Amazing. Had shrimp and small scallops and included flour chips with a chipotle seasoning...Second, I tried the grilled corn.  Best I've ever had.  Next we tried the tacos...Cherry Steak taco and the Urban Bean Beef taco were both out of this world.  Might be the best two tacos I've ever had.  We also tried the Al Pastor Port taco but I wasn't as happy, it was good but not like the other two.  Adam the bartender was really helpful with navigating the menu and Garth the manager was so pleasant and welcoming.  We ended the dinner by splitting a piece of their Coconut Pie.  Soooo good.  Even though the drive is 30 minutes, I plan on coming back over and over.",

Say hi to Jason Kline who is the general manager.   He made a point to stop by and make sure our experience was awesome which it was as always.  If you Lauren as your server, you will be totally taken care of.  Enjoy!    So we came back today which was a week later after our review and I tried the chicken enchiladas and they were amazing.  You must try them during the next visit.  Also try the green chili queso!  Delicious!",

The restaurant itself is an old Korean church that was converted. The decor in the interior resembles an old cathedral. Upon entering we were immediately seated and drink orders taken. On Fridays, they have live music and it can be a little hard to hear. Our waitress was very sweet, and after she brought our drinks, she quickly took our food order. Everyone in my party ordered tacos and one person ordered a burrito. The tacos were good, not great, but good. I had a pork taco and a shrimp taco. The shrimp was over cooked and rubbery and not good. The street corn you can get as a side however, had great flavor and was good. Lastly, definitely a place to try out and take a gander, maybe next go around will be better!",

My husband and I have had it delivered twice--It is his favorite place to eat as well. We always get the same thing: street corn,rice, beans, 3 chicken tacos and 3 lamb tacos.  The Fundido-AMAZING!",

    "text": "Had some friends in from San Diego in this past weekend and decided it would be a great time to check this place out. We had a party of 11 so it took about 40 minutes to get seated which wasn't bad considering it was a Friday night.. The hostess was as sweet as can be and totally kept us informed about when we would get seated.   First of all this place is downright gorgeous.. The whole church architecture makes for a great space.  I heard others saying how loud it was but honestly I didn't find it bad.. It was louder than most places but gives it a hip vibe.   We had a great server.. He was working hard to get all our drinks and food out and kept all our drinks refilled. Took him a while to sort out all the separate checks but considering it was busy and all I totally didn't mind the wait to get the check.   The menu consisted of pretty much only burritos and gourmet tacos.. Everyone seemed to enjoy them..I had the grilled steak burrito with this really good cajun aioli sauce.. But the side of onion straws it comes with was a definite fail.. No seasoning and mostly crumbs..seems like they could do better than this.. A few complaints about the sides but overall everyone enjoyed it. Price wise it's not cheap for what you get and food wasn't anything mind blowing.   I don't see myself visiting this place much but if others wanted to go I would go back..maybe they will improve some as they go along.",

Eggs, little bits of jalapeno bacon, salsa in a corn tortilla = delicious!  Breakfast tacos are essential in Austin (and TX in general) and I've always wondered why all taco shops don't have them.  They also have cheap margs and a taco of the day for a couple bucks.  Two of us were able to have drinks, 6 breakfast tacos (they are street taco size) for about $20.  They also did a good job on the building, with big vaulted ceilings, and church-ie decor.    John at the bar is always helpful and happy, and the rest of the staff are professional and polite.  Good job z tejas and co.",

    "text": "I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of Taco Guild for months. I drive and walk by frequently since I'm a nearby Cheery Lynn Historic neighborhood resident. I checked out the menu online before they opened their doors and could hardly wait to taste each of the deliciously described taco creations. So tonight we were excited to finally get to check it out.   The very first thing I noticed when we walked through the doors was how freaking LOUD it was!! Like really loud!!! The music is blasting right over your head and my husband and I felt like we had to yell to each other over the 2 feet of table between us. It is a big open space with concrete floors so not a lot to absorb the sound but the music needs to be kicked down several notches. I have been to places where I think to myself it is too loud (and I watch movies and t.v. with subtitles because I can't hear all that well) but for this reason alone, I could not wait to get out of there. It stressed me out the whole time... so uncomfortable.   The tacos on the other hand were pretty yummy! It is not on the menu for some reason, but our very nice waiter told us that you can do a three taco platter that comes with a side (the menu only has everything a la carte). It was my husband, myself and our six year old son. We got two platters, so six tacos and two sides for us all to split. We did the Al Pastor Pork (delish), Urban Bean Coffee Braised Beef (the only thing our kid could eat since everything else was on the spicy side and there's no options for kids), Guild Chicken (my third favorite), Yucatan Shrimp (good, but my least fave), Thai Snapper (my second favorite - so good!) and the Peking Duck (my favorite - surprising flavors - very creative!!)  The sides were pretty bland. The descriptions on the menu make them sound so good. I was disappointed in the Grilled Corn \"off\" the Cob and the Green Chile Achiote Rice. I just wished they lived up to my expectations and were more flavorful.  Another thing is I realize with the loud music and the bar that they are not necessarily catering to families with kids, but there should be something kid-friendly on the menu at any restaurant. A chicken and cheese quesadilla or bean and cheese burrito or something. Take it from St. Francis and Postino's: both more adult settings, but have kid friendly options on their menus. We eat out A LOT and pretty much always have the kid with us. We don't want to have to get a babysitter just because we want to have good food in a fun atmosphere.   Since it is just down the street and we love to support local owned business we will most definitely come back and give it another chance. Like to try some guacamole since I saw the people that sat at the table next to us order it and it looked delicious. I also want to try the Grilled Romaine Salad since the pic on the website looks amazing.  I've reread my review and I hate that I sound so negative. I'd like to think they are just getting into their groove and it will only improve with a little feedback. I want to see them do well since I think it is a great addition to the neighborhood!",

The menu made ordering so exciting, but what came out on the plate did not match up to the description. Everything just tasted so bad. Like very surprisingly bad. It's upsetting because I really wanted to like this place too.   If I am in the area again I would go back for the beer and some chips and salsa but that's it.",

Chunks of yummy chicken in a broth laden with melted cheese and a little kick. I also had the al pastor taco. Tender pork cooked in sweet and spicy yumminess. It also had pickled onions, which I loved. The tortilla was soft, but held together very well, even when I kinda rolled up the whole thing to eat. BossMan had the Guild Chicken and Yucatan Shrimp tacos, which he really enjoyed.   The three tacos were a plate dish that included one side and I chose their rice. It had corn, which I love, and was good, but overall it wasn't anything spectacular. Our order also came with a bag full of delicious freshly fried tortilla chips. Probably some of the best I've ever had!  The taco plate and cup of soup with tax was $16+...a little on the pricy side considering my favorite tacos are the $1-2 authentic street tacos, but Taco Guild will be a good treat once in a while! This point is where they lack in receiving a 5-star review.   The restaurant is located in a renovated old church and I think they did a wonderful job keeping the beauty of it. Even though everything is new, it has that old world feel to it.  Also to note, I believe it was created by the owners of Z'Tejas, so a lot of their flavors may have been brought over. My boss said the tortilla chips and salsa were similar, as well as the looks of my tortilla soup.",

Apparently they have a dj on the weekend so if loud music isn't your thing, might wanna go during the earlier week days. I however thought he was good and didn't mind it. I'm not sure how busy they typically are on fridays but they didn't seem to be prepared for it. My bf and I both ordered chicken items; he ordered 3 tacos and I ordered chicken enchiladas. A few minutes after ordering the server let us know they were completely out of chicken. The only meat we typically eat is chicken but since we needed to make a quick decision on substitutes, I agreed to the pork enchiladas and he got some steak tacos. He actually really enjoyed the tacos (chipotle cherry and adobada). I personally wasn't a fan of the enchiladas. There was a hint of mole taste which I'm not a fan of. Perhaps it said this on the menu and had I seen it I wouldn't have ordered it. On the other hand the drinks, complimentary chips and salsa, and my bf's tacos were delish. The building itself is a restored church with news bulletins and stained glass still intact. I loved the feel and it had some real positives so we'll certainly give his place another go",

But only because we had the BEST waiter ever, Miles, along with some other gems on their staff (his girlfriend, the lovely girl who used to be the hostess, the asst. mgr, etc).  However, some things are better than others:  The service varies too much when we don't get Miles or one of the waitresses that we know.  As in, its been so bad that we've just left.  It shouldn't be that inconsistent.  They have not been anywhere near as adventurous with their tacos daily tacos as they were a few years back.  While never bad, many times they are just OK.  The biggest selling point is that the daily tacos are only $2 each.  The salsas are not robusto!  This one hurts as, again, it used to be much better.  Plus, this is where my toddler learned to love salsa.  The decor is, of course, amazing!  Seating is good and the valet service (in such a tiny parking lot) is welcome, even if the poor guy has to hustle all night.  We may return again but, sadly, never every Friday as we used too.",

    "text": "So I'm probably going to sound like a total a-hole, but I have to say it anyway. Being a native Angeleno, I really know my tacos. Not only do we have the traditional, street, guisados, and mainstream, but we also have the fancy new styles popping up throughout the outlying cities and counties.  So far, I've never had anything quite like this.  My dining companion and I are well versed in the language of tacos and all things delicious. We happened to be in the general area for a few days and decided to test out Taco Guild (\"it's rated highly - let's see what they got\").  The appetizers: Diablo eggs, Tostones (with coffee beef) and Queso fundido  The foods: Taco flights (Al Pastor, Cladestino Shrimp, Chipotle Cherry Steak, Duck Breast) with a side of Street corn.  I still can't believe that we at it all. But what is most surprising is that this place isn't Michelin star rated (okay I may be exaggerating a little). But from beginning to end, this meal was a masterpiece, the drinks were great, the servers were friendly and happy to provide suggestions.  One of my favorite things about this place is that the restaurant is a decommissioned church and the back bar is where the altar once stood (now an alter to tequila).  Also, free valet parking. (Coming from LA - this is huge)  In conclusion, since visiting Taco Guild in May, I am now in the process of finding gainful employment in the Phoenix area so I may move and be near my beloved tacos.",

Although it shouldn't be too surprising due to the fact that a lot of old churches in different cities throughout the country are converted into nightclubs and restaurants as well.   Well anyway, the overall atmosphere of this place is pretty great. It is generally busy and the wait staff, despite being busy, is still pretty attentive. They have a great selection of alcohol, and the food menu has a pretty nice selection.  The food is okay. The tacos lacked flavor, and the tortillas they used seemed to be a bit dry. Given the ambience of the location, I can see why their menu prices are the way they are, but with the overall taste of the food, their prices should be lowered so it can reflect the actual taste. What they try do in making the tacos' presentation look great, they drop the ball in terms of taste. The chips and salsa are fantastic though so that is a redeeming aspect, and the avocado they served with my taco was plentiful so that makes up for it.",

    "text": "There has been a lot of hype about Taco Guild, and I was pretty skeptical that they could really live up to it. But we were more than satisfied with the stellar meal we had at Taco Guild.   RESTAURANT AMBIANCE/DECOR: To start, the ambiance was so unique. They had decorated for Halloween already which I think was brilliant! They really capitalized on the creepy old church vibe, and I thought it was a fun way to enhance the dining experience. It's also worth noting that we went on a Saturday night and they had a live band. They were FANTASTIC and because they were so talented, it wasn't distracting like live music can sometimes be in other restaurants.   FOOD: They bring out chips and a selection of four salsas while you're waiting for your food. The chips are warm and crunchy, not too salty or soggy which is something I'm really picky about. The salsas are all delicious, but our standout favorite was the pequin pepper salsa. We ended up asking for a large bowl of it and used every last drop on our chips, and our tacos! It had a really delicious flavor profile and also a solid kick of spice.  And miraculously, it paired well with every single taco we ordered even though they were all very different in flavors and spices.   Of course the star of the show was the assortment of tacos we ordered!  We tried the taco of the day (chicken fajita) and they were a great deal at $2.75 each!  We also ordered the lamb, the pork adovada, and al pastor pork. They were absolutely delicious and I'm not that big of a fan of lamb, but the lamb taco actually ended up being my favorite of them all! They grind the lamb so they avoid the problem of tough meat that can sometimes ruin otherwise delicious lab dishes.  The side dishes were good, but nothing spectacular. We didn't order the street corn, though we saw a few come to the tables around us and it looked great! We'll definitely try that next time.  Overall, we had a great meal at Taco Guild and will definitely be back on account of the salsa alone, but obviously ato try even more tacos!",

Both were great portions- enough that we ate about half and took the rest to our hotel for lunch the next day.  The only reason I'm not giving a 5 star is that the happy hour margaritas are... eh. I think I'm more of a gold tequila persona and they use silver I think I'd skip and go for a top shelf next time. Other wise a wonderful place to stop in!!",

I've really enjoyed a couple of the menu items but was sorely disappointed by others. It kind of seems like the flavor balance is off on many of their tacos. The Al Pastor tasted primarily like pineapple, the carnitas was mostly just onion. Appetizers were underwhelming. For positives, the chips and salsa were great and the cherry steak taco is a gem on the menu.   Servers are always nice but service is generally fairly slow, so prepare for that.

In all seriousness, this restaurant is pretty cool. It's in an old church near downtown Phoenix and still has the gothic, cathedral feel. The owners did a great job of creating a new, modern restaurant while maintaining the integrity of the building.   My husband and I both do the tacos a la carte. He orders the corn, too. I posted a photo of it - I'm not a photographer by any means but every time I look at it, I want to go back for more! They have vegetarian options as well.   It's pretty busy during peak hours (Friday nights, Saturday lunch and dinner) so be prepared to wait a little bit, but it's worth it. Have a drink and enjoy the atmosphere. The service is great too. It's very casual and the pricing is reasonable. If you've got family from out of town and want to show off some of the Phoenix food scene, this would be a great spot to hit.  I don't have anything negative to say about Taco Guild. Highly recommended by this Yelper!",

I'm not usaully a huge fan of corn tortillas because the tend to be dry and coarse but they make their own masa there and it is wonderful. Fresh, chewy, and compliments the tacos extremely well. The bartender was a cool dude who made an effort to be entertaining, I appreciate that style in the right setting, cheers to him. The building is way cool as well, it's in an old church, but you don't feel bad pounding tequilla, well played Taco Guild.",

I'm not sure if there was a stinky cheese or veggie in there but it was inedible.  We also ordered the appetizer duo (queso + guac).  The queso was decent.  The guac although fresh was severely under salted.  The perks were the fresh salsa and the street corn which was the best I've ever had.  Butter and spiced.  Super yum.  Bottom line:  I'd only go back for the street corn and what was that smell?",

The waiter circled back around trying to take an order until he comprehended the four of us would not give him our order until I had information about what was gluten free - or not. So finally, the front of house manager shows up with an allergen menu and proceeds to explain the items on this very short list were gluten free which I knew immediately had to be backwards. If Tres Leches cake is on the list, its the gluten list, seriously. Scarey! But scarey became laughable when he proceeded to tell me that so many of their items were not gluten free because they contained dairy and the chef could not guarantee the dairy was gluten free because, after all, \" certified gluten free milk would cost them $12 a gallon.\" Fellow celiacs, you know jiggery pokery (I believe that's the latest for supreme BS) when you hear it. The manager went on to recommend a salad which contained blue cheese, an iffy cheese in the world of celiacs. I gave up on the gluten free menu, ordered a plain side salad, and plain corn which turned out to be an overcooked greasy soggy mess. My partner really liked the salsa!",

The happy hour pricing for house margaritas is excellent, and I've discovered that some of the tacos (especially the lamb and duck!) are exceptional.  My mouth is actually literally watering when I think of them... they're that good.  Staff has been very friendly and accommodating to our group, and the outdoor patio area is a great place to bring a bunch of friends or co-workers.

The atmosphere is unique and upbeat with enough historical references that you recognize the building's history goes back more than a century.   Started out with guacamole and the deviled eggs,  which were both remarkable. We had a variety of tacos that were not your average fare. My favorite was the coffee rubbed carnitas,  bold flavor with a bit of heat and a sweet finish.  Our server, Nick, helped with the selections and we were not disappointed with any of his suggestions.   No room for dessert, but I would consider taking home some more tacos.  The beer selection is primarily local brews with a varied selection.  For a Thursday night it was impressive that they were on a wait by 6 PM.  Complimentary valet is suggested as the lot fills up fast and double parking is the norm.  Any time I am back in the area I will be looking forward to a return visit.",

The sauces and sweet fruits took away from the marinated flavor of the meats. Stay away from the side of veggies. :( My Mexican-American grandmother has a \"two-rule\" about places that serve street tacos: 1.) If you don't see any Latinos in the place, that's usually a telling sign; 2.) If the price of a street taco is more than $4, you run the risk of being less-than-satisfied. I didn't see Latinos (and this is Arizona!) and all taco prices where $4 and up. I won't be returning, however respect those that appreciate this restaurant.",

The corn tortillas are some of the best I've had and the fillings are all so simple but so delicious.   In addition to the standard chips and garden salsa, you are given three other salsas (habenero, jalapeno, and picante) that are <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>.

On the other hand, the atmosphere of the place was great and the staff were quick despite being pretty busy. The decor was interesting in a good way and it looked like an old church. It is a good place to check out if you want to try something new.",

The guacamole was delicious, and I would highly recommend as an app. Their own hot sauces were good too.   Drink selection was decent, and the margaritas were amazing. Also affordable.

They did not bring our food at the same time so I had to wait awkwardly to eat.  Somewhere  we were planning to go frequently turned into somewhere we may go if we are in the neighborhood.",

Tried the tacos, $5.00 for a dam taco? Have had way better tacos than that. The chicken taco was drenched in fat, the only one that was semi-good was the adovada taco? I think. The salsa was delish! I'm a salsa freak, so I would know.  The rice was gross and the beans?? Don't even get me started on that. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being yummy, I say their food is a 3!!

We were a party of 6 and it was a Friday night at 8 pm, but it still should not take 25 minutes for our cocktails to arrive after we ordered them.  And when they did start to arrive, they came out a couple at a time.  So by the time we all had drinks, some were ready for round 2.  And we all thought the margaritas were more like large shots.  3 sips and the drink was empty.  Small glasses, lots of ice.  Decent taste though. I will say the salsa was decent and the warm chips were great.  The tacos were just ok.  I have had much better tacos for a lot less.  And the sides were forgettable.   I would return to try other tacos, but the service just left a really bad taste in my mouth.  It just fell short.  From the terribly long wait for the drinks, to having to search the entire restaurant for the server to get a bill, it all just was disappointing.   We had 2 apps to share, 2 cocktails each, 3 tacos each with 1 side and the bill was $46 per person.",

So WHAT DID SHE DO ... she took my 15 yr old daughters menu to make room on the table!  How was she supposed to make her MEAL selections?  I waived down the very polite and kind hostess who sent over the manager.  The manager offered a VERY half-hearted apology.  I can see why her team thinks its ok to be rude to PAYING patrons.   The replacement waitress was NO BETTER per her nails were unkept with chipped nail polish and lent in her hair.  We ordered ceviche, 3 tacos & corn that came on a husk that needed to be chucked!  If I wanted to chuck corn, i'd eat at home.  I saw other patrons with bowls of corn & she said I didn't order a bowl.  My mistake, who knew.  She also told me it isn't that hard to chuck & instructed me on how to do so!  The food was sub-par & the manager did her good deed for the day by waiving the cost of the ceviche.

Unfortunately because of the acoustics, it was almost impossible to hear the waiter or any explanation.  The food was good, but I did think it a bit strange that when our food came out, it came out piece meal.  We were a group of four.  One plate came out, then two, and the last plate came out five minutes later.  When we place our order, we indicated to the waiter that there would be three individual checks.  When the check came, it was all together.  He offered to split the check, but got the splits incorrect.",

When the sun comes through the stained glass windows it is magical.  Last night we met friends there and as the server was clearing the table, one of the empty taco sleeves fell and grazed my boyfriend's back and red sauce got on his shirt. The server let him know right away, brought over soda water to clean it, then the manager came by with a Tide stick and spot cleaned his shirt. Then he left his card and asked us to send him the bill for the dry cleaning. Then as we left, the manager came by again and gave us a discount card and insisted that we take his business card, as my boyfriend had left it on the table.  I noticed too that they bought us all a round of drinks.  It was over the top nice and their efforts were really appreciated.",

I had dinner with my son and we ordered a variety of things and everything was really tasty.  We started with the guac w/pineapple and serranos & queso duo.  I never would have thought to add grilled pineapple to guac but the sweetness played well with the spice of the serranos.  We had the Schreiner chorizo meatballs.  That came with slightly sweet and sour shredded beets and their prickly pear sauce.  They had me at Schreiner's.  We sampled two of the tacos - the taco of the day which was grilled chicken, corn and I don't remember what else as well as the chipotle cherry steak.  We enjoyed both and loved the (I believe house made) corn tortillas.  We also ordered the Adovada burrito.  Good stuff.  My son somehow still had room for dessert and ordered the tres leches cake.  It was fine but we both agreed we've had better.  Cocktails are handled well with a strong emphasis on craft tequilas.  No maragarita mix here.  2 thumbs up and we're looking forward to the next visit!",

Have to give them credit for the converted church to taco restaurant idea and ambiance- it's really a lovely building with an inviting atmosphere. For those of you that know, good Mexican food is not that easy to find in Phoenix and we were hoping this might be at least a minor Holy Grail find, but alas that is not the case. Food is good, but not great and the prices are really kind of steep for what you get. Out server was really good, helpful, courteous and funny. The drinks are actually quite good. We ate outside in the patio area early evening and it was a cold evening for Phoenix. There was only 1 outdoor \"torch\" heater working and it was by our table. After we finished the meal we were talking and finishing our drinks and another server came by and asked if we would give up the heater so it could be moved to a nearby table where the customers \"were eating dinner soon\". So what is this? You don't have enough working heaters and we're supposed to give up ours right this minute because we are waiting for the bill and finishing our drink? Not very good customer service when we had drinks that were $10 and tacos that were $5. Someone else said their esp was telling them this place was more about the $ than being a good restaurant and having good food, and the evidence coming in seems to support that. Probably not going back. Good concept, nice server, but not worth it for the price, quality of food and customer service (again, our server was great!).",

On par with every new, hip restaurant in town, the music was too loud , the place is designed to be loud and it's not conducive to having a conversation. I'm being a little more generous in my rating than I might be because it's only been open a week. If I were only rating the food I would only be at two stars because you can get good street-style tacos elsewhere that are just as good at almost half the price. I was surprised that ala carte tacos were $4.00. I expected them to be bigger and better at that price. We ordered the ceviche of the day which was nothing more than tiny shrimp and a few pieces of white fish with some mango and onions. When I saw how small the portion was I immediately thought it to be was overpriced at $10. It was nothing special. I won't be ordering that again and I don't recommend it unless you want to spend an extra $10. We didn't enjoy the chips they served with the ceviche either. They looked interesting and there was twice as many as needed for the small amount of ceviche, just didn't like them. We liked the chips that were served with the guacamole better. The guac was which was fresh and very good. Maybe I'll give the food a try another time but I think I'm more likely to come back for drinks and eating will be my secondary focus.",

    "text": "After seeing all the reviews, we were so excited to try this place! Unfortunately, we ended up completely underwhelmed and disappointed. I wanted to love it, but the atmosphere was as cold as the queso and the tacos were a bit try hard - especially the braised lamb...but in all fairness, it's my fault for thinking it's ok to put blue cheese on a \"taco.\" Rookie move. If you order flour tortillas, they are the Mission tortillas you find at the grocery store. The corn tortillas are hand pressed and grilled - very tasty. The skinny margarita was delicious (late night happy hour 6pm-close) and our waiter was pleasant but not worth the $ and wait. Good news: it shares a parking lot with Starbucks so if you get sleepy during the long wait, caffeine isn't far. Overall: skip the Guild and head to The Mission.",

I just took my out of town guests here for my 2nd visit and I realized how much I need to make Taco Guild a staple in my life.   The staff is super friendly, all the waiters help eachother out and ensure that every diner has what they need super fast. I've probably ordered every taco on the menu at some point and they're all delicous. My friends got the guac and loved that too, although I'm weird and don't partake myself. The lamb taco reallllllly stood out to me last time, I wish my entire platter was just those. The drinks are as good as the food and everything is reasonablely priced. After Gallo Blanco closed and changed names on me, I'd been on the lookout for another modern mexican place and I'd have to say that Taco Guild is even better! Check them out, its awesome.",

He's playing covers of 90s, 2000s, and today. A bar at the front dimly lit and with architecture vaguely reminiscent of a dungeon. Everything about it is unique and eclectic.   Loved the generous serving of chips and salsa. All the salsas offered were fresh and delicious. The chips we salted a little for taste. My hand kept reaching over for more.  Tacos themselves were okay. Most of our party of 13 got the 3 tacos combo - select 3 tacos and get a side for free, or street corn for $2.50   Al Pastor Pork taco - super greasy, dripped all over my hands. Flavorful. Pork Adovada taco - large slices of avocado. Mango jicama relish was delicious.  Yucatan Shrimp taco - a crowd favorite, generous with the shrimp. Local veggies side - soft, salty, lacking in oomph   According to dinner companions: Tropical Ono taco - Ono was dry and lackluster Crackling Lamb taco - too many flavor combinations that didn't work well together Street corn - awesome presentation but not the best ever in terms of flavor. I wished I had gotten it when I saw it, but according to my cousin, the corn wasn't spectacular and could've spent a little longer on the grill.   Our server was really accommodating and friendly. I'd be back to try some of their other tacos, probably on a Saturday to enjoy some of that live music.",

They start you off with chips and 4 different salsas and of course-bottomless! We ordered the bacon jalapeno guac, a taco for each of us (al pastor), and their street corn. A must is their corn!

I had them put it into a cup so it wasnt as messy or so it wouldnt stick in my teeth the rest of the evening.  However by doing so it was not that good.  The flavors and spices were off.  They didnt even cut the corn off the cob.  It was out of a can.  The tacos were just ok.  Nothing I had'nt had before unfortunately.  They were hot and fresh so nothing bad about them.

Have no chips with guacamole in to go order",

They were very knowledgeable with our group, explaining the different types of tequila. I would recommend for a group setting anytime! I will go back again on a date night as well at the bar. Thank you Taco Guild! Oh and also very importantly, the food and drink were great!!",

    "text": "Cool space and great staff. I had a really good beer, and the chips were awesome. Ok, that was the good stuff.  The salsa that went with those chips? It had a little texture, but no life - badly needed some brightness, more spice or a little smoke.  Our \"old school\" tacos failed on almost every level, starting with house-made corn tortillas that desperately wanted some time on a griddle. Not only did they fall apart while trying to contain the generous helpings of bland filling, but the pale color and weirdly-smooth texture were more like rubber than anything else.  The coffee-braised beef taco needed more than java to perk it up. No spice, under salted, and the jicama relish was missing its crunch. Sorry, Urban Beans.  Pork adovada, at least, had some flavor. But the cilantro was leathery, the avocado not quite ripe (poked through the tortilla!) and that same, sad jicama relish.  Finally, the al pastor. Reliable, safe, al pastor. Uh oh.  Bland, greasy, and chewy, sweet like sugar instead of pineapple tang. Even the pickled onions were bland - a real shame since these badly needed some zip and crunch.  The final disappointment was the local veggies, a halfheartedly-warm cup of brussels sprouts, zucchini and others that were sorta-cooked in such a way that I can only assume they were tented in foil and left in the hot Phoenix sun for a few hours. Roasted, sauteed or grilled? No. Steamed...maybe? It's a mystery.  Thanks to the host and server who kept our early-afternoon visit from being a total debacle. And let me know where to buy those chips for home, since we won't be back.",

The church presence creeps me out and the chairs are kinda uncomfortable.",

Pros:  - This restaurant has an awesome vibe. - The chips and salsa. - Queso dip  Cons:  - The chorizo meatballs were meh. - The taco meat in every taco was very bland  The service was fine, which I see a lot of people complain about. Didnt try anything from the bar, so cant comment.  So, why 2 stars? This is a taco place and if your tacos are bland or not great, I have to judge that hard.",

It was made with grapefruit which was light and refreshing. For an app we got the duo which comes with queso and guacamole both were very tasty I enjoyed them a lot more than the salsa that came with the chips. I did the 3 tacos pork, chicken and shrimp with the street corn. The AL pastor was very dry, chicken delicious and the shrimp was OK but nothing special. The street corn was fabulous and sweet. Would definitely come back for apps and drinks!",

Great choice! It seemed fairly busy that night, but with her speedy service we wouldn't have even noticed. She kept our water filled, got our margaritas promptly, and helped recommended sides for our entrees. The blueberry margarita was the highlight of my meal. Parking was a bit irritating, but next time i will be usuing their complimentary vallet.  Overall it was an amazing anniversary dinner! Samantha helped make it specail with her service and she even took a photo of us at the end of our dinner.",

I ordered three different kind, I believe the steak, duck and crispy fish. The crispy fish wasn't Terrible but it wasn't great either. I feel the pairings of toppings on the meats are just bad choices and the flavors are not brought out very well with the options they selected. On all of the tacos I noticed that the corn tortillas tasted like they were right out of the bag.. not warmed up at all, very gritty. The rice tasted like it was out of a box and the service wasn't the best either. Again I hate writing negative reviews but in all honesty, my 3 stars for the margs, chips & salsa and ambiance is a bit generous.  Sorry guys.",

We liked the church setting, the stained glass windows were pretty cool. The not so great....it was super noisy in there. Some noise absorbing bolsters or something would help. We had a hard time even hearing our server. We sat at a raised long table, it would be nice if their raised tables had foot rests other then just on the chairs. We also weren't very impressed with the service, in general. The good.....the chips were great! Perfect amount of salt, still warm and plenty of them. The dishes we ordered were all pretty good. The tables are arranged nicely so you don't feel like your are on top of the table next to you. They worked with me on dairy avoidance and substitutions to my meal, so I appreciated that. Not sure if we will be back, mostly due to the parking situation and the noise level, but glad that we gave it a try.",

The restaurant is in a former church, so there's beautiful stained glass windows and there's a mural (there's a better word but I can't come up with it right now ) on the ceiling as well, which is also fun.   To start, you get a bowl of perfectly fried tortilla chips (you can get refills for free!) and 4 different salsas. The menu isn't super large, which makes decision making easier, especially because everything sounds and tastes great. I got a taco platter with a side of Mexican corn--totally worth the $2. The flavors were complex, and the ingredients fresh. The margs we're good too ;) Totally worth checking out if you haven't been.",

    "text": "UPDATE 1: I recently went back to Taco guild to have the AMAZING brunch again, and had a very odd experience. Let me just say, the issue is not the food/server/runners, but the hostess. The hostess on shift was extremely rude to my family and I and completely soured our whole experience. I went in to ask about outdoor seating at first, she shrugged it off and gave immediate attitude when I simple \"I'll check!!\" Would be suffice. She then tells us there is a seat, but it'll take 10 minutes to seat us. I asked why and she said \"cuz I have to clean it\". She stood at her stand for 5 minutes just staring a wall (also checking her phone once) , then proceeded to take one thing at a time to the table. It was like she was dragging out the experience on purpose. She then, gives us attitude when calling us over to our table and plops us down.  Our service from there was amazing but we had very sour attitudes for the first half of our brunch due to her rude aura. When we were leaving, she said bye to another family leaving the patio, and just stared at us.   Taco guild is a hidden gem in Phoenix that houses GREAT food for GREAT prices. I went to Taco Guild on Father's Day, for brunch.   I was sat with my family the moment we got there, which was a nice surprise since it was Father's Day at lunch time.   The waiter we had was very pleasant and very attentive to us overall.   I ordered the coconut French toast, and it was DELICIOUS! I opted for no coconut, but it was still amazing. I ended up boxing some of it, but I ate it later because I was craving it so bad! The sausage was okay, pretty average and very, very greasy.   Everyone else's dish was received with no complaints.   I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant, it is casual, but feels very upscale. The fact it's in an old church makes it seem even cooler.  Overall, I would definitely recommend to a friend and return back. My only complaint is, I wish our plates were brought at the same time. But, it's easily fixable!!",

SO COOL.   So now to the food. Also so good! We way over ordered appetizers so we didn't end up eating a lot of food, but the tacos we had were great. I had the old age pork taco. If I had to key in on one thing other than the atmosphere here it has to be their AMAZING deviled eggs. I don't even like deviled eggs and I swear I couldn't get enough of these.",

I had three lobster tacos and a side of queso, my husband had steak, chicken and lobster he ended up getting 5 because of their size.  These tacos are amazingly good, they top it off with a piece of fried avocado and I just couldn't get enough. Three tacos were plenty for me, I ate a lot of the chips and salsa which is also filling.  I will say the queso was not my favorite. Initially it was ok, but became cold and hard really quick. I wouldn't order it again. I also had the 1893 margarita, that also wasn't one of my favorite things. I wouldn't order it again either.

    "text": "Within a month of moving to Phoenix, I'd been told multiple times to try Taco Guild. I don't know why it's taken me this long as it's clearly a downtown favorite, but I finally made my way here for Taco Tuesday last week. My overall impression of the food was kinda meh (minus the complimentary chips and house-made salsas, which were stellar), but the decor and creativity were impressive. It definitely felt like I was paying more for the experience than the food though.   Located in the same small plaza as Starbucks and Buffalo Exchange, parking is an absolute nightmare during dinner time. There's a complimentary valet at the door and street parking in the residential area close by though. The decor inside is rustic and roomy, and I think the interior designer really pulled out all the stops, down to the modern-antique chandelier. Because the inside is one huge dining room, it did get pretty loud with the echoes of everyone's voices bouncing off the walls. Service was fine.  Taco Tuesday wasn't a specific set of tacos; instead, all tacos were 50% of their original prices for a smaller portion. Tacos ranged from $5-$7 generally, and the Taco Tuesday portion was about the size of my palm (I don't have very large hands). There is the option to choose between corn or flour tortillas.  Chips and salsas: Ohhhh my goodness, hands down the best chips and salsas I've ever had. The chips were so fresh I could inhale them, and they were the perfect thickness and crunchiness. Paired with the variety of salsas, I was really impressed at the beginning of the meal. I liked the original the best, but the green sauce had a lovely freshness and bite while the orange yielded a nice sweetness paired with spicy. Definitely my favorite part of the meal.  Red meat tacos: Short rib, leg of lamb, and molida lamb tacos weren't bad, but nothing to write home about. Carnitas taco was dry as a bone and tasted like jerky. Combinations were creative, but I don't know if all the ingredients really went together to elevate the tacos.   Seafood tacos: I probably liked the fried cod taco the most. The cod was battered and fried well so that it was super tender inside. The overly crunchy cabbage slaw ruined the texture a bit, but I thought the combination worked. The lobster taco had impressively poached lobster that was very tender, but it was cold to the bite and made me not want to take another bite. I also think this would've been better with a flour tortilla because the corn made it a bit gritty.   Duck taco: I think this was maybe the Peking duck taco before, but I'm glad they renamed it because it was not reminiscent of Peking duck at all. I could barely taste the duck because of how many components there were, and they all seemed dissonant.   I'm all for innovation and creativity, but sometimes I think that can go overboard. Taco Guild falls into that category for me, and I left somewhat disappointed and craving a hearty traditional plate of tacos. It's pretty unlikely I'll be back.",

It's a bit removed from the downtown area (where I was staying), but an Uber/Lyft ride there is definitely affordable.   The restaurant was crowded, but my friend and I were able to stand at the bar and have a drink before our table was called. Once seated, we ordered the queso fundido with chorizo for an appetizer. The portion was on the small side, but the queso was excellent. We both had the three taco plate for our entrees - I had the al pastor, chipotle cherry steak, and clandestino shrimp. They were all very filling and the meats and toppings were excellent. I got the bowl of street corn as my side, and it was extremely oily/buttery. I'm normally fine with a little extra (and it's not like I was trying to eat healthy by going to Taco Guild), but the corn was swimming in the oil.   All in all, I'd definitely return to Taco Guild. I loved the old church vibe and beautiful ceiling frescos. The tacos were great and the service was decent!",

But, the food and drinks live up to the hype as well.  They have a generous HH from 2-6:30pm with $6.50 margs & $2 off all other alcoholic bevvies.  The frozen marg is pretty delicious and well-made. I also had their house Clandestino Mexican Lager (with a lime) and it was perfection with my taco trio & street corn.  I got the coffee braised beef, clandestino shrimp, and lambo tacos. All we're absolutely exquisite and flavorful and each was a fav for very diff taste reasons. The sauce on the shrimp taco was wowsa, the sweet potato hash on the lamb taco was nom, and the coffee braised beef was a taste-extravaganza unto itself!  The street corn was also abfab delish and a must have on the cob!  I had their horchata w/the shot of tequila as my dessert and it did not disappoint!   Also, the service from the min u walk in is top-notch! The bartenders were so good! Gracious, engaging, and knowledgeable about suggestions!  Will definitely be back with recruits as I have seen the light!",

Wow pretty bad all the protein, had 6 different kinds, none were memorable, ones most memorable in a horrible way is the molida lamb, it had blue cheese a shit load wtf, couldn't taste anything else, it could of been horse or snake meat, grounded absolutely weird.  Korean fried chicken, omg soggy sadness, I think you would be punched in the Face In Korean town Los Angeles if you served that shit and called it kfc,  call Roy Choi for some tips.  Chicharron, hard af burnt parts.  Not even gonna go into the rest, fried cod like filet o fish mcdees flavor, all the tacos had 75% garnish and 25% protein.  I'm not a fan of this Americanized fancy tacos but came here for some tequila and vibe, that was good.  Tequila flight and margarita house was more tart than sweet, I liked.  But yea just meat cilantro onions and limes, done.  Not of this bs.    Fried avocado. Breading too thick.  Guacamole pineapple mint, needs more acid, maybe juice from half a lime.    Chips were the best!  Salsa was all about same heat level.  Most real deal Mexican spots would make a super hot salsa upon request, not here.  They have a habanero , weakest I've had.  Like habanero for beginners, or for middle school girls.    Flour tortillas a bit thick and undercooked.  Corn not much better.    Come here for drinks, can't go wrong, salud!  Arriba!!!  Sorry gonna change to one star.  I remember server saying salsa is homemade, how hard is it to blend up a bit more habanero and add to your habanero salsa to turn up the heat.  Pretty pathetic and lazy, I hate lazy people.",

Every time I come in, the servers are super friendly and polite, always have great suggestions for the drink menu, and the no matter how busy they are, the food comes out really fast. The wait is usually a little bit long 20-30 minutes is the average, but it is SO worth it. If you're looking for a top-notch taco place, Taco Guild is your best bet!

We got there after the dinner rush which was great. It was quieter, the music was fire, and our waitress wouldn't be frazzled. But service was still slower than I expected. It took 25 minutes just to get our cocktails. When I got mine, it did not taste anything like mango so that was a waste of money. Then we ordered. I specifically asked for my duck taco not to have gorgonzola and it came with it anyway, I think it ruined the taste. When I asked for a new one; it was 100% better without the cheese. The steak and lobster were both creative but not very memorable.   The saving grace of the dinner was the plantains. They were wonderful and the added sweetness it's sauteed in wasn't overkill. I loved them. The atmosphere of the renovated church is so cool! It's just not worth the price tag.",

Walked inside and took a little bit to get seated and even longer to get greeted. We also had reservations :(   The ambiance of the restaurant was really cool, it's an old historical church! Super unique. When you are inside I could literally imagine where the pews would be and the stage, etc.   Tour meal comes with chips and salsa- a little disappointed with the salsas. They were very mild.   But then! I got 3 tacos with the corn off the cob and all of those were super spicy. It was like two extremes. I was not impressed with the shrimp tacos with bacon- it was a weird combo.  Chicken and steak tacos were good though.  They have a Jux box you can play music on with the app on your phone too! I didn't get a wow experience, but it was a nice, unique place with some interesting flavors.",

    "text": "I'd been wanting to check out Taco guild for some time now. Finally got a chance to visit on a Sunday evening. It was a pretty busy weekend just before labor day. I ordered a burrito but they made a mistake and brought me veggie enchiladas, the food had taken awhile too. I will say, I'm happy for the mistake because the enchiladas were phenomenal and I'm not a big enchilada fan mind you. Next time, I'm definitely ordering the burrito and expecting that though. My friends ordered tacos and a burrito I think the lamb one, boy their burritos are HUGE!!! We were unfortunately too full for dessert. I like that they have options for vegetarians and vegans too. Overall our food was good with the exception of the burrito arriving not really too hot (which they did reheat and bring back) and the mistake w/my order. Our server was available and around but felt they could've done a better job with clearing the table as we sat with dirty dishes in front of us for awhile. I also did not like when you go to pay, they bring you the electronic device for you to swipe your card at the table and then the server stays with you while you sign and put in the tip. This is kinda uncomfortable I feel and puts pressure on the customer at that point. Due to some of these experiences I'm giving them a 3 but I will say the food was a 4! Definitely will be back again.",

Taco Guild takes some basics from south of the border but isn't afraid to take many liberties with them. This can be hit or miss.   I liked the vegetarian tacos.  They were a bit on the sweet side for me so I couldn't imagine having them as an entree, but I would definitely redirect the vegetarians in my life to give it a try. My friend ordered a tamale (stuffed with green chile and cheese), and I was pleased when I had sampled it as well. Nothing that blew my mind, but it was different. In a good way. Just keep in mind their happy hour menu is an entirely different menu than everything else, with each item containing noticeably cheaper and less creative items. This is opposed to having at least some regular offerings at a discount. That feels rather avaricious, but at least you'll feel confident you can enjoy *something* here.   What really impressed me was the salsa--it's surprisingly good. I absolutely adore the habanero variety, even if it had me fronting like I'm not tearing up and burning a little bit inside. Trust me, I love that feeling, and can't wait to torture myself again. Overall I believe Taco Guild keeps things different enough to warrant a return trip, and I'll be sure to stick with the dinner menu next time. In fact, I'm excited on that prospect. If I get dragged in for another HH, however, I will be content.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I first dined at Taco Guild several years ago and felt kind of neutral about the whole experience. While the church is impossible to forget, I have very little memory of the food itself. Recently, we decided to make a return visit in order to refresh my memory.  Admittedly, I've never really been a fan of corporate concepts. And when you look at Taco Guild from an objective standpoint, that's kind of what this place is. Nevertheless, the idea of converting an old church into a lively restaurant and bar arguably has its charm. Plus, my Mom will be proud at hearing that I attended church for once, since she's been nagging me about it for the last decade. Hey, it might not be Sunday service, but it still counts!  Anyway, there's a spectacular little restaurant making all kinds of positive noise over on Broadway known as Cocina Madrigal. The reason I'm mentioning this is because it happens to be operated by former corporate chef Leo Madrigal, a man who previously had connections with Z'Tejas and Taco Guild. And if you're familiar with Cocina, one of the first things you'll notice is, despite the fact that he's moved on, Leo's fingerprints are still all over this menu. The guacamole options, dessert pies, and even some of the tacos themselves are very similar in style to what you'd find over on Broadway. Taste? Well, that's another story entirely, but I'll get to that in a minute.  The guacamole here steers more towards the pureed consistency. I like my guac to be creamy, but this felt more along the lines of what you'd find at those fast-casual chains that make it in mass bulk for convenience purposes. The fact that it was delivered in less than a minute has me thinking that's probably the case here as well. Street corn tasted fine, but was a bit too soupy compared to what we usually prefer.  Now, as for tacos, it's kind of tricky. I've had incredible bare bones tacos that use nothing other than the meat itself. At the same time, I've experienced some that are unique, inspiring, and delicious as a result. Taco Guild is shooting more for the latter. The cherry steak taco was a notable standout in terms of flavor depth, while their soggy pastor just wasn't really my style. Carnitas and coffee beef were just bland, with the additional ingredients providing minimal help. Please note that they do not provide limes by default, but you can always request them. Unfortunately, by the time our server returned with limes, our tacos were almost gone, defeating their purpose.   For dessert, we opted for their coconut cream pie, which came with some very good cinnamon cream on the side. The coconut itself, however, just didn't have that \"pop\" that you find in some coconut-style pies. It was fine, but not something I'd ever order again.  Overall, I still think this is a cool place when it comes to atmosphere. Service was very friendly and prices are pretty similar to most joints that are going for this particular type of taco style. If you're a full-blown taco snob, I doubt you'll be blown away. However, in terms of what they're doing here and based on the crowds, they've running a pretty nice operation that most people appear to be very pleased with.  If you haven't been, they're definitely worth checking out. And whenever the tacos slip from my memory again (which they undoubtedly will), perhaps we'll return one day and give them another go around.",

The parking was terrible,I felt relieved when we got inside because it is the coolest place.We were seated in a church pew. The food either lacked flavor our had too much flavor it was very inconsistent. Ordered the bacon jalapeno guacamole and it was exactly that, bacon jalapenos and avocado.No flavor no salt no acid in the mixture.It's a fine balance when you make guac and this was just so bland. The tacos were just ok but I've had better from the taco truck at Charlie's. The \"chicken\" taco was awful, the meat was unidentifiable.I honestly could not tell it was chicken very soft but a weird soft, the shrimp was o.k. small pieces. Pork was o.k.I had hopes for the cherry blue cheese steak but it was a total fail. I get that these are more upscale tacos but you still need to have taco staples, you need the basics not just crazy tacos with a bunch of interesting ingredients.I feel the restaurant has a ton of potential but it's just not there yet. Better quality meat I expected grilled steak and chicken, nice pieces of shrimp for $89.00 for 4 people we left starving because we could not eat the food.I didn't even have liquor.Oh and I ordered the corn it was decent.The rice was bland, the red salsa was good I reminds me of Baja fresh salsa but better.  So, it was a cool place I'd go back for drinks but not the food. Maybe it's because I'm Mexican and I've had tacos all my life but some people say if there aren't people of the same culture as the type of food eating there it's not good. I must say the service was excellent! But still....I'm never eating here again.",

These are \"gourmet\" tacos with lamb and peking duck(cough), but I didn't find them any good for the price. I prefer La Condesa for this type of fancy tacos.  For real street tacos, stick to holes-in-the-wall or stands/trucks. Given that, the old church setting is actually kind of cool and worth a one-time visit.",

    "text": "This is officially a new favorite for date night. Love the ambience of the renovated church setting. Great decor, albeit the space is not huge and the best seating is definitely at the bar. The bartender was fantastic. Didn't catch his name but he's a taller bald guy with lots of tats (everyone has lots of tats there but he'll stand out). Very friendly, interactive, and gave outstanding service. Things move a bit slowly here so go in knowing that this will be a leisurely dinner.  Drinks: order These Boots Are Made for Oaxacan. I'm a tequila girl but rarely like any sort of mix drink...this one was out of this world, 10 out of 10.   Food: build your own burrito and the shrimp and snapper tacos were TO DIE FOR. And definitely worth the wait (the kitchen was allegedly \"backed up\" but the place wasn't overly busy..) It's satisfying to leave a place, look at each other and say, \"every single thing we had was amazing!!\"",

The atmosphere was beyond incredible.  Such a good job was done on preserving the church the restaurant is located in. The stained glass windows are fabulous, the re purposed light fixtures are amazing! When the chips and offering of salsas came they didn't disappoint. There was spicy options for my fire loving Hubby and daughter and more mild yet flavor filled option for me. I ordered the veggie omelet and it was so yummy! The veggies inside went way beyond the regular offering of peppers and mushrooms I usually find. There was asparagus,  thin sliced Brussels sprouts and so much more! I loved the mismatched china, great touch! My family loved their taco combos. I look forward to our next visit to Arizona and the Taco Guild!",

When you walk in, the church vibe of the restaurant was really cool, but that is when our cool experience ended.  Our server was nice, but the food service was so slow. We sat down and immediately ordered since it was just two of us, Food took over an hour for a vegetarian burrito, and when it came out is was average at best, and the side was a bunch of fried veggie things. The salsa was uninspired, and the Guild Duo was not great either. Gallo Blanco has better guacamole. La Contessa's burrito's are far superior.  Then it was insulting that they wanted to give us $5 each to take off our next meal, WHICH DOES NOT ADDRESS THE SLOW SERVICE AN BELOW AVERAGE FOOD ON THIS VISIT. They did take off $10 because we vocalized our displeasure about their offer,  We will probably use the $5 off for a beer, since that we be hard to mess up.",

The house sauces come in 3 small bottles tableside, but it's nearly impossible to get anything out of them. La Condezza on 16th Street with its impressive salsa bar delivers this same concept much better and cheaper.",

My only complaint: We all thought is was pretty disgusting that there are no doors covering doorways to the bathrooms. Yes, you don't walk directly into the bathroom, but when you are sitting anywhere near the open doorways, which lead to a tiled \"bathroom looking\" area, it can be enough to turn your stomach. Why not cease the opportunity to place another beautiful and creative piece of woodwork? Come on, Mr. Fox.",

The decor and architecture is an amazing mix of new and old so you get an ethereal feeling from the minute you walk in.  Then comes the whole tequila and beer experience!  Nothing like sharing a shot of tequila and a cold beer on a Thursday night (their happy hour lasts till 7 PM) and feasting on a duo of queso and fresh guacomole infused with jalapenos and bacon.  I honestly didn't know if I would have any room left for dinner, but where there's an amazing taco, there's a way.  The tacos are divided in two groups, Old World and New World, which basically means old-traditional, new-mind blowing.  I had two off the New side, the Yucatan Shrimp (a favorite of the entire table) and my favorite, the lamb with Creole aioli, bleu cheese and sweet potato hay.  I can not wait to take my next group of out of town visitors to this amazing little place and I will ask for Joshua again.  He was knowledgeable, helpful, funny and a great waiter.    PS:  They do not take reservations, however you can call and get put on a wait list.  Its worth it.",

Chips and salsa were pretty good, on par with what you would expect from a mexican joint.    Coctail... I ordered the Gentlemans Agreement, this is a solid drink.  I cant recall exactly what was in it but I can remember being skeptical on how smooth it would be.  I was very pleased.

Always great service even when they are busy everyone works together and makes you feel welcome.  Can't wait for my next trip back. My husband and sons love to go to learn more about the different types of tequila. The manager, Justin is very knowledgeable and takes the time to explain how they are made and the differences between them. They have a large selection of tequilas and offer passports that you can purchase to try the different tequilas as you learn about them.  My guys all love this place.

The place is very nice inside but that's where it ends. 2 stars for ambiance. Do not expect real Mexican food. It's all trendy bar food. The beef taco I ordered was greasy. The carnitas were dry. Portions were small and expensive. I will not return but it was nice to see the beautiful interior.",

Drinks are average price but try the frozen margarita, It's really good and strong.     Only reason why I didn't give it a 5 stars, the Spanish rice was undercooked.   It was borderline hard.   But other than that, the food was great and amazing service and I'm full.  Capiche.",

    "text": "This is a great find! In an old church which the property dates back to the 1880's, the current church building was constructed in the 1940's. Exposed wood beams, original stained glass, eclectic decor, including enlarged copies of Rembrandt's on the upper walls. The huge bar takes the place of the old altar complete with 2 60\" tv's that almost appear to be floating above the massive back bar. They squeeze a lot of fresh fruit for their cocktails. I had the Blushing Seniorita.. It was so good I ordered a second;) it's a berry sangria. My husband had 2 craft beers. The tacos are street tacos, so they're small but packed full of flavor! I tried the coffee beef, Peking duck, and shrimp tacos with a side of onion straws. The Peking duck was my fave. My husband had the coffee beef, the chicken, and the al pastor. He enjoyed the coffee beef the best. His side was the corn off the cob and he said it was really good. History+good drinks+good food+ atmosphere= cool place ya gotta check out!!! The service at first was a little slow, but the place was packed. We were seated immediately, but it took a bit to order and get our meal. To be expected when its a new place and the place is packed. I know we'll be back again:)",

The manager on the floor was very accommodating and so was our server.  They placed a generous amount of chips and salsa on the table and we indulged in the ceviche of the day (which was the bomb. com. ) I tried the lamb taco and a side of if i remember right habanero corn. YUM! The history of the restaurant was very intriguing. Also they have 100+ tequilas on hand and a jukebox with 3 million songs on it! If you are looking for a good crowd, good vibes,and  good food this is the place to stop by!",

I am a bit of a guacamole snob, and theres is the best I have tasted anywhere, period.  The server, Jesse, was exceptional, friendly, and made sure everything was up to par.  One of the owners came over, introduced herself, and was very friendly.  The service was just to the point that you weren't annoyed with them constantly checking on you (face it, we all know what that's like), but checked enough to be sure we were completely comfortable. (and full!).  The restaraunt is near downtown (ish), so it isn't a long trip.  Service was fast too.  They took an old church and made a restaraunt that is functional and works.  Stained glass windows, and even have old church buletins on one wall.  I will be going back.",

Now I'd like to make it clear that my star total is strictly for the food.  The service, the decor and the ambiance are wonderful.  This place is beautiful and everyone was super friendly.  I will go back just because the experience was awesome, but I won't be the one suggesting it, because of the food.  The food was alright, but not outstanding.  I do like the options.  They have a duck taco and a lamb taco.  So that's fun.  However, the tacos were small.  For $4-$5 a taco, two should fill me up.  And you don't get a free side unless you buy 3 tacos, otherwise they run about $2.50.  I had a side of rice which probably wouldn't have filled up my hand.  I get that they are quality local ingredients, but I feel like the markup is a little ridiculous.  If you have a large appetite and a small budget, I DO NOT recommend Taco Guild.  Being that we live in Arizona, there are MANY other taco options around.  If you do go, go for the building.  It is really lovely.",

Fabulous bar, spacious restaurant seating area, good acoustics and the decor is great.  Whitney was our server and she could not have been more helpful and friendly.  Once we poured over the menu, loved everything we ordered.  Grilled romaine salad knocked it out of the park!  Coffee marinated beef taco was beautifully prepared and huge portion of meat that was tender and great flavor profile.  We also devoured the roasted corn.  Thank you Whitney for the wonderful service!  Can't wait to come back!",

Very interesting mix of tacos to choose from from lamb with blue cheese to peking duck. Prices were fair and service was excellent. Could turn into a new regular place for us.",

I was a little concerned with the 3 star rating in Yelp. The restaurant was really nice inside and out. I love that they kept the stained glass. To start off with it took about 10 minutes for our server, she blamed the long wait in another table. As an starter we had the Handmade Guacamole, it was super bland. It seems to be really basic onion, a little tomato and the avocado. We tried adding some salt and pepper, it didn't help. My husband doesn't like a lot of spiciness, when we asked for a recommendation the reply was \"everything has a kick.\" I tried three tacos and received a free side. The Yucatan Shrimp was only ok. The Peking Duck was bad, the duck was very dry and the taco was over powered by the Apricot compote. The Thai Snapper was good, really small for the size. Tacos for $4.95 not again for us. The best thing I had tonight was the Pacifico, maybe I should have had more than one.",

A little pricey at $4.25 par taco but if you get three you get a free side and it always comes with chips & 4 kinds of salsa. The coffee braised beef, lamb, or Pastor pork are amazing. Never tasted anything like them. Went to work the next day and told everyone about it.",

The food was as inspiring as the surroundings, with some of the best tequila and margarita drinks that Jesus ever transformed from water. The complimentary chips met all of my expectations of crisp and fresh chips, and the diverse mix of salsas that accompanied them were fresh and tasty (my chips were a bit over-salted though according to my blood pressure readings).  It was tough to settle on food choices, but I chose the scallop and shrimp ceviche, the cherry beef taco, and the Pork Al Pastor taco. Three solid choices. The ceviche was beautiful and perfectly seasoned with cilantro and onion, served alongside ridiculously addictive chips. The tacos were both great choices, but I will have to say that the cherry beef topped with bleu cheese was probably the single best item I enjoyed on my Phoenix Mexican gourmet tour.  The service was excellent and very attentive. I do believe Jesus is calling me to come back to this church again.",

Duck was slightly too sweet, but not a deal breaker. Beef could use more jicama crunch, but no complaints in the flavor. Mmmm.   The corn LOOKED amazing, but I wasn't hungry enough to get it. Definitely will next time.   My cocktail was decent, but the waitress didn't have enough knowledge of the menu to guide me toward the best option for me. If you're going to drink, opt for the craft beer or straight tequila instead.   Taco Guild is holy ground indeed. A Phoenix must!",

Why not 5 stars? They forgot to give me a place setting (fork and knife). Otherwise great service.",

It brings pain to say, because hopes were high, that the tacos are not great. - Shrimp taco: the amount of sodium in this taco was such that I couldn't taste anything else. - Snapper taco: although the snapper was dry, the flavor was actually pretty good. If Thai curry were to be a taco, this is the one. - Veggie taco: this was probably the most confusing...and sad. It was listed in their \"old world\" taco section. I took this to mean that this was going to be standard southwestern flavor.  Nope. Soggy Brussels sprouts, tomatoes, cheese, and...guacamole? Why?!? I love Brussels sprouts. Taco version was horrifying. -Pork tacos: flavor was, for the most part, absent. Meat was dry.  Overall...sad times.",

It got really busy and there was a group that wasn't attended to at the host stand so they were just looking for a table to sit - which they decided to sit at one of the long tables where two people were already dining at. Very unorganized. Service was mediocre. Food was not that great. I had guacamole and chips, the Mexican corn and the taco trio plate: duck, shrimp and Ono.I took one bite of each of the tacos and corn and only could consume all of the shrimp taco. Corn was drenched with mayo and the Ono and duck taco were bland. Guacamole was ok, salsa I liked. Overall, I probably will not be going to this church anymore.",

I'll start with the good -- tacos off the menu (my shrimp taco and my friend's coffee-braised-beef) were delicious. A little bland, but their give chips/salsa with various salsas that helped add a nice little kick. I also got street corn, which they drizzle/slather jalepeno mayo and cotija cheese on. It was amazing, I ate every last bite of it. I have to take a star off though because the daily taco (chicken with a jalepeno marinade) and tres leches cake was not impressive. Daily taco I can understand, it was a $2 deal at happy hour. And salsas helped make it pretty good. But the tres leches cake was more dry than it should have been. It did have a nice mango topping though!  I sat at the bar and had excellent service. My receipt said my server was Eric -- thanks for taking good care of us! Everything came out quickly and our drinks were quickly refilled :)  Oh and parking isn't the easiest -- the lot gets packed and has some reserved spots for Buffalo Exchange nearby. There is street parking nearby. I drove around the lot twice and found a spot that (thankfully) wasn't reserved by buffalo exchange.",

I've been here just enough times to try nearly all, and I have yet to be disappointed. What I fell in love with the most was their street corn. BEST. STREET. CORN. EVER! It has a lot of heat, but the sweetness of the corn makes it so worth every bite. I also love that their drinks don't feel skimped on the alcohol and I can leave with a good buzz after two and a very happy and full stomach.  The service here is incredible as well. The first time I visited, I sat at the bar, and the gentleman was sure to take his time with us, and really personalized our service. It made me come again, and again. Each time, my waiter/waitress has made our meals really awesome experiences. There is also live music, though I have to admit, nothing has been able to compare to the first time I went and there was a gentleman singing with his guitar, I swear I fell in love.  Thanks for the great atmosphere Taco Guild, I'm sure I'll be seeing you again soon!",

    "text": "If you're ever in Pheonix you gotta try Taco Guild! It's a pretty unique resturant that has settled in to an old church building built back in the 40's. The atmosphere, however, almost seems to take you back to a modernized version of the middle ages. My group and I decided to sit in the outside patio area to enjoy the embracing hug of Arizona's dry heat.   The menu choices, which all seemd to be original creations, had a sense of foreign familiarity. I chose to order the Taco Plate which allows me the option of 3 tacos and a side. My choices were (from left to right) the Chipotle Cherry Steak, the Tropical Ono, and the Urban Bean Coffee Braised Beef. (Each were satisfying in their own way, as I'll explain in more detail below.)   The Chipotle Cherry Steak, which contained poblano straws, chili aioli, and Bleu Cheese, was amazingly flavored packed! If flavors were colors I was definitely chowing down a rainbow. Now I'm dedinitely not a fan of Bleu Cheese, but the combination of flavors gave it a homey feel, and for the first time in my life I can say that I enjoyed the strong aromatic taste of Bleu Cheese. Overall, this taco kind of had a BBQ sauce ambiance about it (despite the fact that it did not have traditional BBQ sauce) which caused me to be more critical, since I'm a BBQ sauce fanatic. That being said, I rate it with a 7.5 out of 10.  The second taco I tried was the Tropical Ono. Ono, also known as Wahoo, is a fish closely related to King Mackerel and is found in tropical waters, especially around Hawaii. Although this fish is commonly know by the name Wahoo, the Hawaiians called it Ono, which means, \"sweet, very good to eat\". And \"very good\" it was! The Ono was lightly breaded and a wonderful crispness to it. With menonita cheese, roasted tomato salsa, coconut slaw, mango, tomato, and cilantro, this taco was definitely the freshest tasting of the three. The taco did have a sweetness about it, especially due to the mango and coconut, but it was balanced with the right amount of saltiness from the fish. Overall I give this taco an 8.  I was the most hesitatant about the third taco, mainly due to the fact that I don't like coffee, but I gave it a go anyway! This taco came topped with caramelized onion, mango jicama relish, and Cotija cheese. When I took my first bite, I immediately knew that this was my favorite of the three. It was the taco that surprised me the most! Although, I did taste the coffee flavor and it's bitterness, it was beautifully balanced with the sweetness of the carmelized onions and relish. The braised beef was shredded and perfectly tender. Overall, this taco was a surprising win for me. I honestly didn't think I was going to like this one so much, and so have to rate it a 9 out of 10! Definitely a must try.  Lastly, I finished my meal by eating their famous street corn. It's a grilled corn on the cob with habanero butter, Chipotle mayonnaise, and Cotija cheese. This corn was a combo of sweet and spicy, but not an unbearable spice, despite the fact that it contains habanero. It was more of a \"tickle the back of your throat\" spice. I would totally recommend this as your side if you come here.   So, in conclusion, if you're ever in Pheonix, this is a MUST try place! These options I tried were definitely not the only options, and I guarantee there are others just as good or even better. Go check it out!!",

Really, pleasantly surprised with this place.  I had heard that the atmosphere would be cool (which it is, stunningly nice, even), but not to expect your traditional Mexican fare.  Armed with that knowledge, came in with no expectations and left very full and quite happy.  We started with the Guild Duo of their guacamole and green chile queso.  Both were good, but not amazing.  I would say the tableside guacamole at The Mission is a superior guacamole, but this one is just fine.  The green chile queso lacked a little green chile punch, but I would still order it again based on my love for melted cheese and chips.  The ceviche comes with an order of what are basically totopos - deep fried tortillas, and the are delicious.  A little over-seasoned on this trip, but hard not to like in any situation.  The ceviche was a shrimp and scallop ceviche and it was good.  Not great, but good.  Could have stood to have a little more acidity but it is a dish I would order again.  As for the star of the show.  Ordered the Taco Plate which comes with 3 tacos and your choice of a side.  I was getting full so I ordered the side salad, which was great.  I couldn't help myself, at heart I'm a taco purist, so I went with two Old World tacos and one New School taco.  The Old World tacos were the pork adovada and the coffee braised beef.  The new School taco was a Yucatan shrimp.  They were all tasty.  The braised beef was well braised, juices dripping from it.  I was the coffee would be overpowering but it was not - well balanced taco.  The adovada was similarly balanced between some heat in the meat with the mango relish on top.  The shrimp taco was perhaps my favorite.  Los of tender shrimp with some avocado - it was subtle, mildly flavored, and very well executed.  So again, don't come expecting street tacos.  This is elevated Mexican with some additional pizzazz.  Together with he friendly service and the setting - it's worth the trip to this old church.",

The daily taco is only $1.99 during HH, that is the only HH food.  I used to not like corn, but now I am addicted to their street corn. The salsas that come with the chips are great, most are super spicy for me, but my husband loved them. First time I was here, it was with our International Supper Club.  Now I come with my husband a few times for they amazing HH.   The place is very cool, I haven't been to a church in ages, but  I will come to this one anytime.  Parking is a little tough, you might have to find some parking around the corner on the street.",

I sat at the bar with my boyfriend and ordered a few margaritas along with some tacos and appetizers. The guacamole was great and the chips were nice and crispy. The tacos amazing! The corn tortillas were made To perfection it was light and and airy so it did not overwhelm the overall taste of the taco. My favorite was the beef chorizo at only $2,50 during happy our and the street corn with chipotle mayo was bomb! We also ordered ceviche which to me lacked a little bit of salt and lime. I also like my ceviche well diced and the small shill came as a whole so that was the downside. My favorite margarita was the 1893 at $6 during happy hour.  The price value was good for the quality food you get, differently worth the trip! Everything was fresh and tasty or the most part! :)",

The food is way too overpriced for it to not even taste good and the atmosphere was disappointing.   The only good things were the margaritas and the service! Our server was prompt and helpful.",

Stain glass and everything.   The tacos are amazing. You have a few to pick from and you can't really go wrong. I typically will get about 2 tacos. With that and chips it's more than enough to feel 100% satisfied.   The servers are great and the atmosphere is relaxed. This is the place I go to whenever I have people in town. There are a ton of cool places to eat in Phoenix. But, this for sure is one of my top 10.  I use it to show off how cool Phoenix can actually be. If you want great food and a cool experience do yourself a favor and check this place out.",

Came here for a date night with my husband on the recommendation of my masseuse. The service was fine, despite being busy. And I have to agree with the reviewer that said their salsa and chips are great. That ends there. The tacos had a good amount of meat, certainly filling and the corn tortillas were soft and good. However the meat was a tad dry (with the exception of the lamb) and not super flavorful. Additionally, my margarita was good and not too sweet, but the actual volume of the drink was small and mostly ice which was disappointing. Overall an okay place with a neat atmosphere and service, but the tacos and drinks leave a bit to be desired.",

I ordered the taco plate with the chicken taco, shrimp, and steak. They have specific names but I already forgot sorry guys! However, the best one was the steak one I think it was like a cherry steak concoction. I do have to say the food is a little too bland for my taste. The rice lacked a lot of flavor and so did the tacos.   Our waitress wasn't very attentive I had to flag her down for a refill of my water after waiting 15+ min to spot her. It wasn't busy either so I was a little confused as to where she was. It took longer to get my check and pay for my food than it took for us to finish our meals :(   I do have the say the chips and salsa were amazing. And the host at the door was amazing. He was very welcoming! All in all it's a cute place maybe next time I will just do happy hour. I would love to try their drinks and maybe a different dish",

She was very sweet, and she was attentive. Also, the young lady who walked me to my table was an absolute doll!! She really wanted to make sure I was happy where I was seated and it showed.       Now for the food, EXTREMELY overpriced, very small portions, and not very good at all. I got the Queso dip to start. The dip was ok at best. The portion was VERY small. I got three tiny tortillas to dip with. Those were pretty good, but the dip had a dark flavor that I really didn't like.       For the main course I got the three taco plate. I had the pork, the duck, and the beef tacos. When they arrived they were TINY like street tacos. When you're charging almost $5 per taco, they should be three times that size. My total for the night was $27, for three really small tacos and a small portion of dip. I can go to the Beach House on Camelback and get three large fish tacos that are fantastic for $6 total.      The tacos were really not good. Just not much flavor to any of them. This is what happens when you try to make gourmet tacos and you don't make sure the flavors are top notch. They were a bit mushy, the flavors were not meshing at all. Just not good!      The building was an old church, which is very cool, except for the fact that, it was EXTREMELY LOUD. I couldn't hear the waitress at all, even when she was shouting in my ear.      I won't be back, mostly due to the price and the quality of the food. Waist of money to go here when I can go someplace else and pay $15 dollars and get much better food, and a great deal more of it. So much for Taco Guild.",

I like that you can order just one, or get a selection. Perfect for if you just want a light snack to go with your sangria. Chips and salsa selections plentiful.

    "text": "Amazing food! Amazing service (great job Madison) I stopped in for lunch today and had a wonderful experience. (Thank you Steven) This restaurant opens Nov. 18th and I can't wait to go back.   I had the guacamole with pineapple and mint, it was very refreshing and a must for AZ warm weather, house salad, and two tacos. I tried the Urban Bean Beef and Thai Snapper. I love coffee and Urban Bean (the local coffee shop next door) so the beef was my favorite of the two. I recommend the Cilantro Dressing on everything.   The decor and ambiance is wonderful, so glad to see that they kept many elements of the old church but it still feels like a restaurant. They have happy hour on both Sat and Sunday which is really nice.   Thanks for a wonderful lunch Taco Guild, I can't say enough great things about my first dining experience! Excited to return and try the Lamb Taco and Ceviche.",

Amazing! !! A bit loud on a Friday night with the live dj in a small space. . . But that pork is enough to pull a 4 star and I'll be back! !",

They still incorporated some of the church originals in the restaurant, which I personally feel like gives it a lot more charm. Food was fantastic. Try out their guacamole, it is so yummy. The chorizo was yum yum yum! The tacos were larger than I expected so I should have ordered 2 instead of 4 lol. Overall, I had a great experience here and will be back with more friends.",

No cilantro means no cilantro usually, but at the guild it means extra I guess. 3 of us made small changes to the menu items and none of them were complied with.   Also, refills were non-existent (water or tea).  The poor hostess had to come through with out only refill of tea as we were about to leave. I apparently forgot to ask for iced tea as all we got was warm tea in our cup.  So to recap, chips and flavor of food was awesome. Don't change anything on the menu. Don't expect solid service. Maybe they were busy. Or had an off day.",

This place should be called \"Tequila Guild\" (because the selection is vast) and not \"Taco Guild\" because the selection isn't great. My girlfriend ordered chicken enchiladas and her beans tasted like straight up Hormel chili!! Everything else was really bland.I ordered 3 tacos and was only impressed with the shrimp one. All in all, it's a really cool atmosphere with lack luster food. For the price you pay the quality of food you receive is not adequate",

It almost felt like we needed to eat and get out quick because of where we were awkwardly sat.

Had a margarita, some tacos and a side and it was very, very tasty. Do plan on coming back.  The only issue I had that I noticed when I was looking at my online banking, the processing charge on the card I used was 20% more than the receipt, which left me confused (also I tipped with cash instead of on my card). I called the following day and talked to a manager, they said it was charge for the proper amount and wasn't sure why it showed up as a higher charge. Maybe it was because it's a fairly new business or with my bank (BOA), but wasn't completely clear why. When the charge was processed, it was for the proper amount. Not sure why that happened, maybe next time I'll pay in cash...",

During happy hour, the taco of the day (that day was pork carnita) is only 2 dollars.  We got 3 tacos (you get 1 free side then and the rice is a must try) and 3 of the happy hour tacos and were stuffed at the end of it.    Like I said the rice is awesome.  Its got more flavor that you typically get, bits of corn also adds to the appeal.  I really liked the pork adovada and the carnita.

The service was ok though we were confused about who our waiter was because it seemed it was someone different all through our time there. Can't say it was great because they didn't even keep  my water glass refilled and when they finally did (after being asked) I didn't get any ice.   We LOVED the salsa that comes with the chips. Just the right blend of flavors and quite unique. It was also nice to have the different sauce bottles of varying heat but really not necessary as we are now addicted to their salsa. We tried five different tacos with mixed reviews. The chicken and the lamb were good, the veggie and the beef were okay and the fish was awful - very fishy tasting. It said it was snapper on the menu but I have never tasted such fishy snapper. My sister had the veggie burro and that was pretty good. The side of rice was so-so but the beans were great. We also had the prickly pear sorbet with berries and liked it.  The owner?/manager was quite friendly as was the staff. This is just a preliminary review as this was our first visit. Since we just bought a house in the neighborhood, I'm sure we'll try them again - if only for the salsa and the beans!",

First of all, I LOVE the whole feel of the environment.  They did an incredible job of converting the old Korean church into a trendy hangout spot.  The presentation of the bar is really great, and the balance between keeping some of the original features of the building with new accents is spot-on.  Between the 2 of us, we ordered 5 tacos: an al pastor pork, a duck, a snapper, a lamb, and a veggie.  The al pastor was incredibly good!  Probably the best I've had in town.  All of the other ones were also really delicious.  I also love that they have their own sauces that are made in house!  All of their draft beer is local.  My fiance had the Cartel IPA and it was really good!  Food service was quick and all of the staff was super friendly.  We will definitely be coming back here over and over!  There wasn't a single aspect of this place that I didn't enjoy.  5 stars for a job well done!",

The only disappointing part about our experience is that the waiter gave the incorrect bill and once it was corrected thought he may have charged the wrong card for the wrong bill. Despite the unorganized pieces, we are likely to go back!",

    "text": "The Taco Guild is just ok. I really, really wanted to like this place, but the food and service aren't all that great. The building is awesome. Some really cool historical features were kept, and they did a great job with the decor, but unfortunately it doesn't really make up for what they lack in the food and service departments.  My only complaint with the building was it was really loud. The place wasn't half full, and I could barely hear my dining partner.   There wasn't anything exceptionally bad about the service, it just wasn't good. It took them forever to greet us, and then to take our order. Drinks and food took a long time to come  and they switched servers halfway through our meal (which was at like 7:30).   Chips and salsa were good (often a determining factor as to if we go back), but none of the tacos really stood out. The lamb and cherry steak were the only tacos we actually liked. The snapper was awful, and the pastor, coffee braised beef, and duck tacos were mediocre at best. And the sides...I opted for the onion strings and the little lady got the corn.  Both very boring. The only other options were beans or rice (not and).  I like beans and rice, but find both uninspiring by themselves.   I would love to go back to this place, but with so many great places around (including Gadzooks across the street), I don't know how I can justify it. Maybe for drinks one day...",

Owner reluctantly gave us a $5 chip after that. I gave it to one of my friends that night and I live 2 blocks away. I remember when this was a Korean Methodist church.  Decor: cheap looking 'Christopher Columbus' italian border on the former church's inside. Big plasma tv sets by bar. Bad use of such a amazing space!  Food: friend noticed only soft tacos on menu, no hard. My espn says the goal of this is makin $ not good food.",

As a manager, I would reconsider your host. It was extremely rude of him to ask us to move. He called the people's name and they weren't there so he sat us. I was so excited to bring my family whose from out of town here based upon my previous experience which was a 5 star. I will not return because of the host, the food was delicious. I am shocked the manager didn't come over to us and apologize for the rudeness of the host.",

That was so delicious, generous slices of flavorful chorizo on top of deviled eggs! So yum!!! The complimentary salsa for the table was good, i must say the salsa was fresh, abundant amount of fresh tortilla chips! I could not stop devouring them. The corn was delicious as well!   Had the duck taco and the lamb taco. I must say both pretty underwhelming. The flavors sounded great on the menu. The duck had a sweet taste to it, i always look for the gamey meat taste that I crave from duck...and the lamb was overloaded with bleu cheese :(   The service was great and the server was super attentive!",

The menu describes it thusly: \"Tropical Ono menonita cheese, roasted-tomato salsa, coconut slaw, mango, tomato, cilantro.\"  I was not familiar with ono. I found it to be a pleasant, fresh-tasting fish. The Taco Guild grills it. The taco featured a heavy amount of coconut slaw; I'm not a fan of coconut shreds in food, but I really enjoyed this slaw! It had a pleasant crunch without a lot of flavor. I couldn't really taste the cheese, but the mango and tomato complemented things nicely. I'm not sure if I would get this taco again because it's not up to the level of my favorites of lamb and duck, but it's still good. This would be great for folks practicing Lent or wanting a healthier taco.",

    "text": "A very unique experience to say the least. I come from Southern California, so I'm kind of picky with my tacos. The tacos are a little pricey, starting $4.50-$5.00 for a street taco. I had the Pork Adovada and the Taco of the Day which was Cod. Both were very delicious and was packed with a lotof flavor. They tacos were filled with meat and toppings and the tortilla is strong enough where it didn't break or get soggy with all this filling.  I could've and would've eaten more, but $4.50 for a taco is still quite pricey, no matter how good the taco is. They also give complimentary chips and a variety of salsa.  The interior is actually really cool. From the outside, it looks like a church, and they preserved some of the insides to look like a church from stained glass windows to redesigning the alter/tabernacle area to a bar. Lots of history behind the building, if you're into that sort of stuff. I was really surprised. I was a little skeptical of purchasing a $5.00 taco but it was all good in the end. Probably wouldn't  eat here on the daily because of it's hefty price tag, but definitely worth trying if you're in the area.",

The decor and ambience was really nice, and they have a great patio as well. Thoroughly enjoyed our lunch and plan to come back. Think it would be a great place to have a family dinner as they have nice, big and long family style tables.",

Taco's are the dominant menu item but there are also burritos and salads offered here among other items. I ordered 3 different taco's along with a side of borracho beans. We also had chips and salsa. I thought this was a weak part of the meal. Plenty of chips but the salsa servings were small. However I gave them a 3. The taco's arrived in a timely manner and were very good. I wish I could remember their names but one had duck meat, another was chicken and the third had pull pork as the meat. These high end taco's were very good (4).

During that wait time, we were able to admire the reused space and discuss current personal situations. Which was a good thing.  After being seated, we were brought chips and a salsa sampler. That was great, and tided us over whilst waiting for our tacos to arrive. I ordered the Molida Lamb and the Peking Duck; Paul ordered the braised beef, grilled veggie and street corn. He said all his items were average and under-seasoned. I thought mine were flavorful, if not messy to eat. The lamb had a nice gamey-ness that was enhanced by the bleu cheese; the duck was sweetened with plum sauce and apricot compote, topped with a tiny fried mozzarella stick. Which was a good thing. But those things were packed full (which was a good thing, for the value) and a challenge to eat. Paul said it's because I try to eat all proper and stuff.  Overall, this was a good dining experience for me. Not so much for Paul.",

We also enjoy it as a romantic date place although it can get a little loud during the afternoon crowd. During the cooler months wonderful outdoor seating with the right ambiance to take one back in time or to a magical place. A must see when in the Phoenix area.",

The server was kind of snotty, inconvenienced by my menu questions and recommendation requests. The margaritas were decent...the tacos and fundido appetizer were just meh, nothing to write home about. My gut hated me within hours, and that hatred lasted well into the next couple of days.",

    "text": "Wow! How did I not know this great place existed! This is one of the best places I have been in some time! I'll start with the food since that is what you always come back for. Basically, it's fantastic.  We began with the guacamole which was fresh and very good.  The chips and salsas were also excellent. The main \"medium\" salsa was neither too mild nor too hot and had a great roasted tomato flavor. I then had the chicken taco (very good) and the cherry chipotle steak taco (outstanding).  Another in our party had the lamb taco, which he said was ok, but 2 others had the veggie taco, which they raved about. You get your choice of flour or corn homemade tortillas - perfecto!  And now for the setting - old church building built in 1895, original stained glass windows and more. Just a great, great ambiance.  Service? Impeccable also. When we had questions about the building and restaurant our waiter sat down for a few minutes with us and shared some of the history. I simply cannot think of a single negative about our experience. We will definitely be coming back!",

    "text": "I booked a table here for lunch for myself and 3 colleagues very last minute using OpenTable. While booking, I was asked to confirm our preferred seating: outside, standard or high table. We requested standard. Upon arriving at the restaurant, we were warmly greeted and I told the host about my reservation. As I was explaining we had originally requested standard but it was so beautiful outside, he said, \"I was wondering if you would prefer outside - the weather is great!\" And so he put us at a great corner table out on the patio. (Later, a huge great delivery truck pulled up blocking our view and stayed way too long, but nothing could be done about that.) My colleagues all ordered margaritas as it was happy hour (during lunch? on a Monday? Awesome!) but I had a delicious agua fresca. We started off with chips and salsa - the chips were really thick and crispy and the 3 salsas were amazing. Each was a vibrant colour and very appealing. I particularly liked the habanero which was bright orange. We each ordered the 3 tacos and the menu selection was overwhelming. The server in particular recommended the Molida, lamb with blue cheese and also the Chipotle Cherry Steak. I went for the Molida, the Mahi Mahi and the Clandestino Shrimp. I had a real problem with trying to figure out which was the best and most delicious of the three after eating them! I probably found the Molida the most flavourful, but the Clandestino was terrific (that slaw!) and the Mahi Mahi was modern and delicious. Tough choice! I hated to leave the fun, cool place but we had to get back for some meetings. I absolutely loved this place and hope to get back some day!",

In addition to that, the food is outstanding.  I ordered the breakfast burrito, and the others at the table ordered the YUCATAN SHRIMP taco (green cabbage slaw, avocado), the URBAN BEAN COFFEE BRAISED BEEF taco (caramelized onion, mango jicama relish, Cotija cheese), and another breakfast burrito (GRILLED STEAK BURRITO with scrambled egg, grilled steak, pico de gallo, Jack cheese, seasoned potatoes, green chile sauce).  The prices are incredibly reasonable, and the menu is both simple and original (both good things in my mind). Each taco has the right combination of flavors, and the breakfast burrito is both filling and delicious. Overall, a great place to fill yourself up with great tacos.",

I am sure locals would likely love the food, but it was way too \"hot/spicy\" for me. I had the Al Pastor and could only eat a couple of bites. I did order the Ono which wasn't spicy but wasn't the greatest fish taco. The street corn was delicious but once again I could only eat a small amount. The service was great and the venue was interesting with the stained glass windows. Maybe adding a heat scale to the menu items would help a wimpy white girl like me",

The taco itself looked pretty good but when I tasted it, it was gone within a matter of seconds. After I wanted another one it was that good.  The soup was a beef and veggie soup, overall it was soup. The beef had a good taste to it and the cast iron bowl it came in was convenient and kept my soup nice and hot.  The Hubs got a smoked pork torta. Which he thought was good as well..   My favorite part was the chips and salsa. I make homemade salsa all the time and am usually doctoring up restaurant salsa but this one. Nothing to change it was great! Spicy, Peppery. And just right!   The only reason why I did not give a 5th star was due to the long wait. We asked our waiter for the check and it took him about 5 min to do so. Which we were in a rush that's why we asked. But besides that everything was good!   Next time I will plan better but definitely going back.",

    "text": "My friend and I try a new place every week to celebrate Taco Tuesdays. We decided to visit this place based on another friend's recommendation. God bless the man! Let me start with what first meets the eye.. its a church! It literally couldn't be more church-y. Stained glass windows, Renaissance reprints on the walls, an altar converted to a bar.. it's got it all. It has a really cool vibe overall, which already makes you feel positive about the restaurant.   Their margaritas are alright, but I generally stick to beers to play it safe. I've tried a bunch of things here over the last few months and almost every one of those items have delivered! Their version of fundido is actually pretty fantastic.. I would highly recommend it. Also, they have phenomenal elotes. I would absolutely recommend that you get them on the cob. I tried the alternative only to find corn kernels floating in a pool of butter. Stick to the cob.   Two words- Lamb. Tacos. Holy hell! It has got to be the most well balanced flavor profile on a taco I've had thus far. I despise blue cheese with all my heart but it totally works here! They top em up with fried sweet potato strings.. absolutely genius! I have a pretty standard order when I visit.. it's two lamb tacos and elotes. There's no way you could possibly go wrong. I have friends who've tried other things and none of them had anything negative to say about the food. It certainly is pricier than other taco places but I think the lamb tacos are totally worth the splurge, so to speak. Try it and thank me later :)",

They had a very talented artist playing guitar and singing. It was beautiful and very pleasant. Remember to tip them too by the way if you enjoy their music! Anyway, I tried the grapefruit cocktail to start. It has grapefruit and some jalapeno which surprisingly complemented each other quite well. They offer 4 salsas to start And they are all different heat levels, with the orange one being the spiciest although tolerable for my palate. Very yummy! If you order 3 tacos, you get a free side. I ordered the cherry beef, the old age chicken, and the carnitas. Honestly I wasn't a fan of the chicken taco, but the beef and carnitas were very tasty and juicy! I wasn't really a huge fan of the rice either.  I also tried the margaritas with elderflower liquer and wow! It is up there with some of my favorite margaritas, and I have had many margaritas in my life. Definitely try it if you're visiting this place.   Amazing atmosphere. Great cocktails. Tacos for anybody's taste and salsa too! I really enjoyed this place. Service was also exemplary.",

    "text": "It's been a long wait for me and my first time at Taco Guild.  Part of the reason is, well, there's taquerias pretty much around every corner in the valley.  But the biggest reason for my hesitancy was the lackluster early reviews.  The complaints were pretty wide ranging but the price point of the tacos seemed to be the biggest beef Yelpers had with this place.  Lately it seems like the trend is much more positive so I can only assume that means they've gotten themselves into a better groove with their customers.  My brother-in-law suggested we go here for dinner on a Wednesday so off we went to the northwest corner of Osborn and 7th Street.  The biggest selling point about Taco Guild is and likely always will be the building.  Its everything you've heard.  Its gorgeous.  A spectacular rehab and preservation of a longtime valley Church building that has been transformed into a beautiful restaurant space.  The multitudes of unique features from the stained glass to the murals, to the woodwork and chandelier are enough to make for an entire dinner's worth of conversation by itself.  When we arrived around 6:30pm the place was packed, but fortunately there was room at the bar which was where we were headed anyway.  We started with the usual chips and salsa, though here you get three other sauces to go with it.  One of which tasted like a cilantro veggie sauce, another tasted similar to Tobasco, while the other I'm pretty sure had a tinge of habanero.  Nice variety and I was quite fond of the cilantro option.  The menu here is pretty straight forward with a heavy emphasis on the tacos (appropriately enough), but also with some other Mexican fare including burritos and enchiladas.  The 3 taco plate seemed like an appropriate opening salvo for my first time so I went that route.  I went with a Pork Adovada, a Guild Chicken, and a Yucatan Shrimp taco with a side of rice.  Total price for the tacos, tax and tip came to about $16.    The tacos were terrific with the Pork Adovada being my favorite of the bunch (I think the relish was the biggest reason why).  The rice was a lot spicier than I had expected (I only later discovered the rice has green chiles plus two types of peppers).  In the end Taco Guild provided me a tasty, filling dinner served by friendly staff.  Yeah, the price per taco might be a little steep, but not completely out of line.  The quality of the ingredients and the tortillas were such that I was still quite pleased.  And as mentioned earlier, the environment and the aesthetics were outstanding.    As I write this, Z'Tejas Inc (Taco Guild's parent company) has filed for bankruptcy so I hope I'm not going to be among the last to write a review about this place.  I can't speak to the current condition of the Z'Tejas restaurant chain (admittedly I haven't dined at a Z'Tejas in awhile).  Though if tonight was any indication, it doesn't seem like Taco Guild is anything but a success story for Z'Tejas.  Even if Taco Guild itself doesn't survive, there is absolutely no reason any other business shouldn't be able to succeed in this breathtakingly beautiful space.",

Their happy hour is FABULOUS! $5 margaritas that are just crafted beautifully! Great selection of ales and beers as well. The inside is GORGEOUS!!!!! It is a converted church and is so stunning!

We had great cocktails, delightful local beer, and wonderful food! I highly recommend the Chicken Guild taco and the Coffee Bean Beef taco! There were eight or nine different tacos at our table, and each one was thoroughly enjoyed. The side dishes and chips and salsa were also top notch! And save room for dessert; best Tres Leches I have ever had! There was one small issue with my cocktail, but the bartenders, servers, and manager went above and beyond to apologize, correct the issue, and make sure that we were happy with our experience. I was very, very impressed... And will be back again for another outstanding night!",

The word Taco caught my eye so we wandered over for some dinner.   The environment of this place is amazing. Everything is beautiful, I feel like I could look around for hours and hours. All of the plates are from the Salvation Army. It's so fun to see what plate you will get next since they are all mismatched.   I got the taco plate which was about $10 with the Al Pastor, Urban Bean Coffee Beef, and the Veggie taco. The al pastor taco was extremely flavorful and had very tender pieces of pork-no nasty grizzle. The coffee beef with mango and jicama salsa was wonderful with the contrast of sweet and salty. I especially liked the veggie taco with roasted brussel sprouts, peppers, and mushrooms with hummus. All were very flavorful. The Corn with Habenero Butter was also amazing and flavorful.   Service was extremely friendly and we never had an empty glass. I can't wait to come back!",

The shrimp was SO flavorful with just the right amount of toppings in the tortilla. The snapper was very tasty, but not my favorite. My husband got an al pastor, lamb, and a cherry beef taco.

After 3 different servers auctioned off our food around the table, all the tacos were cold. The ancho chilli black beans were unedible, they tasted like a handfull of chilli powder and cumin. The chorizo rice was bitter and no one ate more than 1 bite. The happy hour $5 wine could not have been much more than a 5 oz pour. The happy hour margarita machine was down, no subs offered. Had a small $9 margarita that tasted good, but no value at that price point. Never offered a dessert menu, still not sure if they even have dessert?  This look like a case of spending a ton of dough on the building, and trying to make it back by cutting corners on the food and alcohol. Probably wont be going back anytime soon.",

I give them credit for trying to do something unique and special with the menu like a Thai taco and duck taco, however the delivery falls short. The first time I went my tacos were cold and the second time they were just warm, but almost like they had been sitting out too. The service still remained likeable, but I could hear that they hadn't done away with their mish mash of music which had no cohesiveness from country to oldies to pop. Don't get me wrong I do like different types of music, but they had nothing really similar that it was just distasteful. The building itself is beautiful and well done. This place really could be great, but for now it's just as okay spot, with slightly pricy food that I don't see myself returning to.",

When we left 45 minutes later, we informed the hostess(?), she didn't really care that the table was still dirty. Then we are over charged.

The concept and the theme was spectacular, we rushed in around 10:30pm thinking that their kitchen is probably closed but they actually ended up bringing out the full menu for us.  When you first walked thru the front door the entire dining hall opens up, the acoustic and the setting made me felt like im going to have some tacos with St. Peter himself.  Here are the things we had ordered, 1. 1893 Frozen Margarita. 2. Jalapeno Bacon Guacamole  LOVED IT! 3. Fresh Ceviche of the day (Shrimp and scallop!)  I had ordered all the New School Tacos and my personal favorite was the Chipotle Chery Steak, and the Peking Duck.  Just beautifully done, the texture of the steak just melts in your mouth.  Their Tortillas were so fluffy and fresh if i had a bed  made out their tortillas i would sleep on it and eat myself with it.   she had the Pork Adovada, Urban Bean Coffee Braised Beef and Guild chicken. She really enjoyed the Pork Adovada out of the 3 (Old World Tacos)  They also gave us 2 free sides, the Green Chile Achiote Rice, and Crispy Poblano Onion Straws.    The service was fantastic, loved the jukebox and the restroom was pretty cool too.

The queso was very good. We probably could have had a meal just from apps alone.   For my lunch I got a trio of tacos. 1. Guild Chicken. 2. Yucatan Shrimp. 3. Chipotle Cherry Steak. All three were very good! My favorite was the steak. I could have easily eaten three of those also. For my side I got the corn. I had them take it off the corn for me so it came in a bowl. Very good. Not as messy. Full of flavor!   Overall good meal. It was good to get away from the downtown meals that we had night after night in Phoenix. Would recommend you give it a try.",

I think that it being an old church being made into a restaurant was a factor.  I loved the design, architecture, and look of this place with it's stained glass windows, old church style doors, and paintings! We were seated promptly and water brought to us by our waitress (who did a great job!)  Chips and 4 different types of salsa was brought out while we thought of what to eat.  The menus reminded of old church hymnals. We went with chicken enchiladas and they were superb! I highly recommend this place!",

Yes, I think he liked it a lot better than I did, but he just really loves tacos.    Now, the place was gorgeous inside, I have to give it that.  It was old church and they kept the beauty of the structure, which actually made me happy.    The service was alright.  Nothing that stands out there.  But I was looking forward to the food.  The menu is limiting.  We started off with the chips and guacamole.  It had NO FLAVOR!  None at all.  It actually made me very sad.  And the tacos?  (I had the chicken and shrimp) was actually bland.  I wasn't impressed.  But I will try you again Taco Guild.  Maybe it was an off night?  But I do have to say, your margaritas were great!",

My new Sunday spot & Happy Hour starts at 2 with a secret menu including an egg brunch taco. WIN! As a vegetarian suto vegan, I have many options.  This place is like the 'Whole Foods' of tacos.  The veg tacos are to die for with rotating local seasonal vegetables...which included brussel sprouts, carrots & collard greens! The tortillas are fresh made soft corn, YUM so tasty! The rice & beans are veg too. And as for the drink, it was so delicious --- I got the Osbourn -- nice & strong, well worth the price using a top shelf smooth Anejo Tequila & all the juice is squeezed fresh.  I don't think they use mixes at all. Great bar & delicious food. & also the chips & salsa are complimentary. Like I said, this place is my new Church on Sunday.",

You can get restaurant high chairs in a single trip to any supply store. It's obvious they do not care for families or care for suggestions. Great food but don't go with kids or large groups.

The warm, fresh chips are served with homemade spicy salsa and three different types of sauces that are fun to try.  We have now been to Taco Guild four times and have haven't gotten past the tacos on the menu-they're that good.  The Mexican street corn is delicious and the drink selection is great, as well.  My companion is a bit of a beer snob and he loves the selection here.  Service is attentive and polite.  We recently held a special occasion party at Taco Guild and they made the experience extra special for us.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  I didn't give it five stars because parking is a bit limited.",

The food has much more of a sweet seasoned flavor over a savory spicy flavor of typical Mexican food.  All Spice, pineapple, mango, banana, apricot, basil and is used and the flavors are unexpected.  This restaurant is a subsidiary (of sorts) of  Z-Tejas, a Scottsdale based franchise.  The conversation I had with the staff lead me to believe they plan to expand as Z-Tejas did to other locations within the state. They also intend to open restaurants in San Diego and several other locations.   Don't get me wrong the food is good. It was so fresh and tasty, it's obvious that chef has been inspired and is trying new things.  It was just not what I was expecting so do not go expecting \"typical\" Mexican.

Walking into this unique and beautiful building to taste one of the cities best tacos- was pure joy. For starters the chips and salsa ( just the way I like them) are served light and crispy with the choice of mouth watering flavorful salsa, from mild to hot habanero. The made in-house corn tortillas the tacos were served in are great. We ordered the Yukon shrimp, both al pastor and pork adovada taco, and the lamb and all I can say is; let the choir- start singing:~ :~ :~   The most moist and delicious coffee braised beef in a taco I have tasted in a restaurant yet. Wow! Not to dishonor the other tacos that we enjoyed, but that one was outstanding. We ordered street corn to eat with these tacos. Pallet pleasing Street Corn -full of flavor! They might have just given the Mission (in Scottsdale) a run for their money on their street corn- which has always been one of my favorites. I am so thrilled that we went to church at Taco Guild! I truly cannot wait to go back to enjoy some of their decadent delicious dishes. If you are a fan of tacos, you make tacos, eat tacos and enjoy them as much as I do - I would suggest that you make a Heavenly stop at Taco Guild Today. Amen & Amen.",

The other Yelp reviewers that I read were luke warm to negative. I am a very picky person. Well traveled. Very demanding. A group of five friends all ventured into the Taco Guild on a Friday night after Thanksgiving, and we were thrilled. The atmosphere is hip and rocking! No wonder the reviewer thought that it had no kid friendly menu! They are right, but they should not knock the place! It is not meant for kids. Shame on them for expecting that from a Taco/Tequila Bar!!!!! It is also loud in a good way. The vibe is super modern, really epitomizing what is happening on Phoenix. The energy was awesome. The drinks were adventurous, if not always successful. We all had a different one, and some were better than others, but none was boring. The food was reasonable in price and tasty, with the hot sauces really awesome. We had planned on buying some to take home, but, sadly, we forgot. We will be back to do so! The tacos were delicious, the burritos were also great. I had the chicken burrito with a side of beans. Others had the steak burrito and various traditional or modern tacos. All were really very good. Service was great, prompt and fun loving. Really hip!  All in all I am thrilled that we ignored the rather mixed reviews on Yelp. They were often missing the point of this urban marvel. The architecture of this converted church alone makes it worth the trip. The food is an added extra. Don't hesitate! Just go!",

I'd been to Taco Guild before for lunch and had been itching to return with husband in tow, but we are never on that side of town. I texted my husband to let him know I had a surprise for dinner! Little did I know, it was also National Tequila Day (how I didn't know this, I'm not sure as Tequila is often my drink of choice). We arrived at Taco Guild to find there was no room to park and an hour wait, but I reassured him it was well worth it. We passed our time listening to Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers while sipping on free samples of his Mexican Moonshine Tequila. Once seated, we accompanied our margaritas with chips, salsa and chorizo meatballs! My husband ordered the Tequila Day special--three tacos and a margarita for $7.24--and I ordered two tacos wrapped in lettuce, which trust me, does not sacrifice any flavor. Together the architecture, food, drinks, service and overall atmosphere make for a perfect night in North Phoenix! We will return to Taco Guild again and again!",

We finally went and like so many others, I have to give it a 5 for the atmosphere and the building. It's unlike any place I've ever eaten at to be honest. But...for the rest it's a big \"meh\". There little tacitos are similar to what you find at nearby Joy Ride which I found to be very close in terms of coolness but with tastier tacos.  I took a dive into what I thought was some creamy avocado and it though it wasn't something that set my pallet on fire it was later confirmed by our waiter prior to ordering that the avocado sauce was with jalapenos...now that I could believe.  As for the important thing, the food, I went for the \"safe\" chicken tacos but there was just something lacking. Not as tender as flavorful and the tacos felt a little too thick. I'll be honest that I'm all for mild tasting salsa and it would have been nice for the waiter to warn that the dipping sauces provided (they are all good and probably perfect for most) are on the spicy side. It also didn't help that there were flies in the restaurant. Not the most enjoyable thing.  I would recommend the place for a drink and happy hour for sure but I'm not honestly sure I'd be back for lunch or dinner. Worth checking out and hopefully having a higher opinion of it then me, amazing decor aside.",

    "text": "so I decided to get some takout from Taco Guild and have a drink at the bar. The design of this place is AWESOME!!! it's like an old church in there with the stained glass windows, tons of wood beams and huge gothic looking chandeliers. I had a margarita on teh rocks, just the perfect margarita. For food, I wetn with three tacos: The peking Duck, the Lamb Molida and the Carne Adovado. The wife had the house salad and a side of crispy onions. Now I will say the tacos are a touch expensive at $5 each for the specialty tacos, but they're quality and loaded with great ingredients. My fave, hands down, was the Peking Duck. it had this peanut and carrot slaw and just perfectly fatty roasted duck..stupid good. I wasn't a fan of the molida lamb taco, it just tasted funky. Teh adovado was pretty good, and had a great apricot chutney on top that worked well with it. From my experience, it was 3.5 starts. Wifey didn't have a good experience. her salad was under dressed, plus done with cheap iceburg lettuce..ickey. And they forgot the aioli with the crispy onions, which they desperately needed. they also left off the avocado on her salad. All in all I'll be  back for sure to eat the peking duck tacos and try a few others out.",

    "text": "Our family went for an early dinner around 6PM on a Tuesday based on a recommendation from our hotel concierge.  Stephanie was right on.  The staff was very friendly.  Jen, Justin and Julia (guess you need a name starting with J to work there) all greeted us warmly, offered insight and assistance for first-timers and seemed to genuinely enjoy what they were doing.  Whether describing the history of the building, the flavors of the drinks and salsas or recommending meals and sides based on our interests, they were knowledgeable and informative.  I was glad I listened to Justin's recommendation to go with the street corn as my side over another selection.  It was delicious, as was the rest of the food.  The guacamole was fresh and flavorful.  The salsas provided a good variety of heat and spice.  The classic tacos were solid, and the modern tacos were creative and tasty.  I wouldn't say it is generally a kid-friendly place, yet they welcomed our tween and teen, and allowed our one son, a somewhat picky eater, to custom order off the menu.   While it may have had an impact on other patrons' experiences (see Tiara's review about \"unusual mix of...music\"), the juke box allowed the boys to program a few songs for their enjoyment during dinner, which were played at a reasonable volume, so you could still easily carry on a conversation.  Parking was the only draw back, as the lot adjacent to the building was relatively small and not surprisingly full; but I'd gladly park a block or two away and walk to the Taco Guild again.",

The wait for the table wasn't a big deal at all, it was a Friday night at 7 - needless to say, we knew what we were getting in to. But the hour wait after that to get food was awful...  especially when you are only getting a couple of tacos. Very tiny tacos at that. Then it took and another 30 min to get the check and pay our bill - no bueno Between our small party, we had duck, snapper, shrimp, steak, lamb and chicken tacos. All were 'meh', nothing to come back for. My friend said the lamb was good, but not something going out of his way for. The specialty drinks were equally unimpressive, and the very average house margarita was still ten bucks. Just for me, 3 tacos and 2 drinks was 37 bucks, for food that was tiny and nothing special to boot!   The design of the building was very cool, well done ambiance (but some really douchey people congregating at the bar who wouldn't move out of the isle as I am trying to walk by with my 4 month old sleeping baby.)  The tequila list looked impressive, but I am not going to spend $200 on a single shot of tequila. Again, everything was in place for a cool dining experience - then the food and service got in the way. (Although either the manager or owner who sat us was very kind and accommodating)",

So last night - when the group suggested we go - I went along cuz that's what I do - if I don't have a strong objection, I can usually find something on the menu I can enjoy.  So how did it go?  First - I love the complementary valet parking.  Score!  Second, love the interior - it's so funky and lets me know they take the experience of eating a great meal seriously.    Third, LOVE LOVE LOVE the process for the wait list.  We had a twenty minute wait ( I think it was actually less - but who cares when you are enjoying the wait.  Am I right?)  I loved that they rang my phone when it was our time.  SCORE!  Next, the bar while we waited.  Happy hour - great margaritas, friendly staff who could hold a conversation while they were working.  Chips and Salsa on point and with out asking.  SCORE!  When it was time to sit -we had a great table and serving staff were right there with ice water and menus.  We ordered THE GUILD DUO - guacamole and fire roasted green chile queso. (Actually ordered it twice - it was so good!) I'm a guac lover - and this was great.  I would have added a bit (more?) garlic - but I'm not complaining - it was great.  The star - OMG - the queso.  I'm in love with the queso.  I could take a bowl of it and eat as a main course.  I'd like to know  how they got that balance of flavor to enhance the cheese without overtaking it.  I tasted cheese AND green chile!  SCORE SCORE!!  My entree - the BEEF ENCHILADAS - birria beef, peppers, tomatoes, house-made corn tortillas, Jack cheese, birria sauce, avocado, sour cream, red beans, rice.  Two enchiladas stuffed full of the most incredible flavored meat - juicy, flavorful, beautiful, and filling.  The sides of beans, rice, avocado, etc were great - but the enchiladas themselves shine bright! SCORE SCORE SCORE etc. etc. etc.  Taco Guild, I'm sorry I doubted you.  Please accept my apologies and my love.  I will be back!  Soon.  Really soon!  And maybe I'll try the tacos.  I hear you do tacos, right?  SCORE!",

The server was super nice and more than willing to provide you with his recommendations if you're unfamiliar with the menu. I went with the three taco platter and it came with the elote. I highly recommend the Chipotle Cherry Steak Taco. It was my favorite one of the night. If you're looking for a more nontraditional taco, then the Peking Duck one is cool to try. Also, you can't really go wrong with Al Pastor and Taco Guild made a pretty dang good one.   I was very satisfied with my meal. My elote was a little on the smaller side but the chef just provided me with an extra one, so it was definitely worth it. The meal was complete with a nice refreshing bottle of Mexican Coca Cola.  If you're in the area and you're craving Mexican Food and Tacos, Taco Guild is definitely a spot to check out. I will be dreaming of that habanero mayo for months to come.",

The fresh salsa is a little spicey, I loved it but a couple of friends in our party couldn't handle the spice. The atmosphere is also amazing, trendy and hip, yet homie and warm.

Sister had three chicken tacos, and I had a customized vegan burrito. The guacamole and chips were excellent. A poll of our Jolly Diners was that it was a 3.5 rating out of 5. Issues: my sister had a 1 inch chicken bone in one of her tacos, the soup of the day type that the waitress quoted when ordered turned out not to be what she told us, so she brought another she thought my mom would like but it was too spicy, so mom ordered a taco. My aunt's taco was not put together very well when served(messy). When the chips were served, they were nice and warm and included four types of sauce. The first and most mild was hot as purgatory. The remaining three were hot as Hades. All were too hot for all of the Jolly Diners and so we needed to order non-spicy guacamole which was delicious. The food was good but because of the issue mentioned we gave it a 3.5. Well come back and try it again sometime in the future.",

We've had a couple very nice waiters but also a few very awful ones (to the point where we had empty glasses, an empty chip bowl, and cold queso because we had no chips to eat it with so we had to sit there awkwardly for several minutes until we could continue our meal).  Overall, the ambiance is wonderful and I love what they've done to the inside of the old church. The food is good and I'll happily continue visiting.",

First impressions matter and this \"little\" restaurant was really great from the outside. The huge, wooden door and stained glass added a lot of character to the entrance. Upon entering the restaurant I realized it is much bigger than I had expected and judging by he crowds of people waiting for a table, I could tell that the food wouldn't disappoint. I think everyone at our table of 5 ordered a taco trio so between us all we tasted every one on the menu. Unfortunately, I wasn't blow away by them but there were some interesting combinations and flavors going on. I'm more of a traditional taco girl and these were pushing the boundaries a little on my tastebuds. The tacos were filling, the presentation was great, but I just wasn't digging them as much as I could have. The margaritas and other cocktails were delicious however! The service was impeccable and I was really impressed with everything else this restaurant had to offer so I'm happy to give 4 stars. I applaud the unique flavors and simple menu. We enjoyed our evening here and the live music was just the cherry on top!",

When you walk in the interior is a church like duplicate from the windows to the the design, very awesome! But I also heard it used to be a church. There brand is to serve local and organic products which is very good it's always good to go local. Hey! You get what you  pay for. As the first time going here, I had a delicious 1893 which is very 2017, see what I did there?! But for 5 dollars why not get a margarita. It's part of their happy hour menu drink they also do 1 off draught beers. Also a awesome thing is they give you free chips and salsa, not just one salsa but 3 other flavored ones to try! Be careful it might be spicy to the taste but nothing's wrong with a little spice in your life. Definitely a totally different menu from your regular taco shop, they take it and make it an adventure. Tacos were awesome, and I guess fairly priced, definitely check it out If in Phoenix. Cool vibes, cool people local too! Stay hungry Phoenix !",

But make no mistake, you're getting great food, great drinks, and TOP notch service.  Lets start with the tacos/food: They have two styles: Old World and New World. Cherry steak, Chipoltle chicken, lamb, thai snapper, a bunch of tacos that deviate from the standard. But they are fantastic. Some of the best tacos i have ever had in the states. When i visited Phoenix, i came here three times and tried every taco on the menu. The thai snapper was my favorite. The tacos were pricy for what they were but the quality is great.   Second, the bar: Awesome. The bartenders are the best part of this place. We did a sampling of mezcal (first time id heard of it). The bartender (hipster guy with beard and tattoos) was just awesome. Told us all the nightlife spots, and knew about seemingly everything behind his bar. Explained how certain liquors were made, local craft beer selections, just awesome.  We came back one night just to talk to him and have some drinks.  Ambiance: Oh yeah, this place is a church. I dont know the history of the building, but its made to look like a church. Steeple, stained glass windows. I have never really been to church before so getting wasted in one was a pretty cool experience. Don't miss this place if your'e in Phoenix.",

    "text": "This restaurant was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, and that recommendation alone was good enough for us, having looked forward a long time to trying it out. It is also touted online, in the menu, etc. as the \"#2 best Mexican restaurant in the US\"! After this experience, I think this must be a rating the restaurant has given itself. At almost any other Mexican joint we go, the food/service is better. The building and main part of the restaurant itself are super cool. We loved the feel and atmosphere, and is the only reason it I gave 3 stars. It was not even half-full when we arrived at 5-ish on a Sunday evening with a group of 20+ that was split up at three tables in a back room, six at our table. It was too warm with no atmosphere. Near the end of our meal, they finally opened an outside door in the room to some fresh air with 70+ weather, which was nice. Now to the meal. I ordered red wine which was so bitter, I sent it back. I got one each of a Guild Chicken and Al Pastor Pork taco. These are literally the smallest tacos I've ever seen, on a minuscule corn tortilla. The chicken was fairly tasteless with \"dry\" grated cojita so tiny (I like crumbles of fresh) that it was like a sprinkling of canned Parmesan cheese. There was no \"grilled corn, red bean pico or avocado\" visible, so very disappointing. The pork was to be served with grilled pineapple, jalapeno bacon and pickled red onion--sounds awesome, doesn't it?! The pork was good, but the only condiment visible were the onions. I had to douse each taco with one of the sauces served with the chips. My fiancee ordered the chicken enchiladas, which took so long that the rest of the table were half-way through their meals by the time it arrived. (Another guest ordered the same entree and his plate came out at the same time as the 4 plates of tacos. We insisted they go ahead and eat after waiting several minutes so their food wouldn't get cold.) I will say the enchiladas were pretty good. But $9 is too much for the 2 tiny barren tacos, with not even a veggie garnish of cabbage, lettuce, tomato, or anything! I wish I had asked what the $1.99 \"Daily Taco\" was, but by the time we could order, I forgot and the waiter did not offer a description; $4 wouldn't have been as bad. Anyway, except for having too many chips while we waited to be served, I left a bit hungry, disappointed and unsatisfied. We might return again to enjoy the atmosphere of the main restaurant and maybe, if we aren't a table of 6, the food would come within a reasonable time and the tacos would appear as literally described in detail on the menu.",

The chips and salsa they brought out were amazing - there were 4 salsas including a really good verde salsa.  Two of them had quite a kick.  We had the guacamole with caramelized pineapple and mint - delicious!  It was a very generous portion of guacamole as well.  For our meal, I had the chicken, shrimp, and lamb taco and my husband had the chicken, lamb, and al pastor.  All of them were very good.  The tortillas were amazing.  Highly recommend!",

I was picking people up from the airport at 10 pm. I called before 10 pm to order specialty tacos, since they serve daily tacos after 10 pm. We got there around 10:40 pm, and when we walked in, there were mostly workers there.  We sat down at the bar and instantly our food came out within minutes. They weren't sure if we were still coming, but they made it for us. That was amazing!  The bartender and server was the real reasons why this place rocks. They were still full of energy and actually enjoyed having us there. They made jokes as we did with them.   The drinks were cool, and tacos were amazing!   I would definitely come back again.   I can see why this place is famous.",

I know a lot of restaurants have their style of preparing tacos, and a lot of them are excellent (even the typical fried or greasy goodness that represents well, but is not the best for the body).   Enter Taco Guild.   Was this building a former Catholic church? Very cool decor, chic/modern with touches of the inquisition.  I like the portions (small) for several reasons.  You can order as many as you want, but 2 will probably suffice.  I had the AL PASTOR PORK grilled pineapple, jalapeno bacon, pickled red onion. 3.95 and the URBAN BEAN COFFEE BRAISED BEEF caramelized onion, mango jicama relish, Cotija cheese. 3.95.

Though the vibe is nice, the food is the most important part!   I ordered the taco plate. I got the adovada, duck, and shrimp with rice as my side. The adovada was amazing!!!! I wish I ordered three of them. 10/10. However, the duck was gross. Actually gross. It tasted dirty. The shrimp was OK but definitely not anything special. I would not order it again but I wasn't horribly disappointed. The side of rice was obviously old because it was crunchy and tasteless... sadly.  Finally, the food came out extremely fast. Too fast. Too fast to be anything close to fresh.   Overall, I would come here again but I wouldn't come for dinner. It was too spendy ($19 with tip) for only one good taco. I'd be more willing to come for happy hour when things are cheaper and I won't be annoyed with subpar food because the menu was interesting. Though, interesting is only good if executed properly.",

The building alone is worth the trip - the resturant is inside a beautiful old church, complete with high ceilings, stained glass window and atmosphere out the wazoo!  The trappings of the restaurant (tables, bar, etc.) are blended nicely into this gorgeous setting.     Excellent food:  The guacamole was delightfully fresh and delicious and the complimentary salsa was tasty (chips - a bith thick for my taste, but fresh).  The tacos really stole the show.  I got the Thai Snapper taco and the Shrimp Taco, and both were super impressive!  I was delighted to discover that, in addition to corn or flour tortillas, you can order them in lettuce wraps!!  I'm not a huge fan of tortillas, and this means I can fit more guacamole in my tummy, plus the lettuce is fresh and delicious, giving the tacos a lovely summery lightness.  I also had a bite of the seasonal vegetable taco, which somehow tasted even better than mine - woah!  The seasonal veggie side was small and tasty, too (I sampled my husband's).  We took advantage of the Sunday Happy Hour (starts at 2pm, all day!) and had beers and wines at a bargain to complement our tasty eats.  Their beer list is short but super local - Four Peaks, Oak Creek, Cartel.  Our server was funny and attentive (excellent drink refills).  Overall, a big win!",

The food was excellent! I loved how they had old world and new world tacos lined out on their menu. So you can get carnitas and pastor but also duck! All decked out with different kinds of veggies and salsas. So rad! They have an amazing queso dip and their guacamole was perfect!

I was incredibly thrilled to see they used home made tortillas in their tacos. Great happy hour menu! Friendly staff and QUICK serving times. Quality ingredients and unique flavorings. I have a new favorite spot to add to my regular outings list. I am thrilled to have Taco Guild in Phoenix. The music is pretty random as well, but I liked it. As I told my friends, Taco Guild is basically church, tacos and Drake all at once. Enjoy lovelies! Five stars!   (Brown person approved lol)",

My favorite, hands down was the duck, it's topped with roasted peaches that compliment the juicy shredded meat just perfectly! Second was the shrimp, flavorful and the sauces it came with with chosen just right for this one. The lamb was overpowered by the tartness of the blue cheese, and the sweet potato hay made it too dry, decent at best. Coconut thai curry was also one we could have left behind, bland and simple.   The interior was pretty cool, and staff was friendly. Definitely recommend!",

While all were good, my favorite was the Al Pastor Pork It had such good flavor and the toppings complimented the meat very well My recommendation: The Al Pastor  Also, they have great deals on drinks during Happy Hour",

I am pretty sure that we were the first patrons in the building and the bartender was very eager to serve us. We parked ourselves at the bar and looked over the brunch menu.   We each picked a few tacos and decided to split a street corn. Our bartender was very nice to ask if we would like them to put the corn off the cob, I very enthusiastically accepted. No need for corn teeth.   The tacos were delish!!!! My breakfast taco, was ok, but eggs don't have a ton of flavor on their own so no fault of theirs there. They put this awesome jalapeno infused bacon inside, very interesting and yummy! I also had the chicken taco, which was perfect! Very juicy and flavorful, usually chicken can be underwhelming, but they hit it on the mark. Jon had cherry steak (I think that is what it was called) and a pork taco and a breakfast one as well. The steak was killer, they put these pepper fried string things on top that made the whole taco. The pork was very good as well, but probably my least fave of the tacos we had.   The street corn was my only disappointment. It isn't what I am used to like at Blanco or Gallo Blano. Theirs is spicy, less creamy and kinda watery. I don't think I would get it again, but some people might like it, you decide.   The place looks great, and being walking distance from mi casa I can see me being there often.",

    "text": "Today was my first time at Taco Guild and I found the entire visit to be very disappointing and the entire reason was because of the level of service I was provided.   As a person with food allergies (dairy, gluten and corn) I try to be as straightforward and responsible about my understanding of a menu as possible before visiting a restaurant. That way I can arrive with some ideas for what I will eat and ask some clarifying questions/inform the server of my needs to ensure that what I am ordering is something I can eat. This is so I do not haw to send something back or take too much time making a decision, which is what I did today.   I ordered three tacos all without cheese and in lettuce wraps rather than tortillas after explaining my food allergies to the waitress. We cut the cheese and and were good to go... So I thought.   When my food arrived, my two beef tacos had breaded and fried green chiles (not gluten free) on them. The menu simply says green chile strips and the waitress failed to inform me they were breaded and fried. Well, alright, I'll pull them off. No one is perfect and my food allergies make things a little difficult. Then, under all that is meat that is covered in a cream based sauce... Great. Well, I guess I'll just move on to the other taco.   I took a bite of the Peking Duck taco and bit into a 3 inch bone that was shaped and was as sharp as a toothpick. I should have taken a picture. I was so frustrated. So I finally waived the waitress offer. She said, \"Oh, well that happens sometimes. I can call my manager but she's just going to tell you the same thing.\" Which she did. Are you kidding me? That is the answer you give a customer? I was done after that. They comped one taco and I paid $19 to go home hungry and eat leftovers. Oh, they also gave me a $5 coupon for my next visit. Well, that was a waste of paper because I will not be returning.",

This time things were much different. We walked in and was immediately greated. We decided to sit at the bar and was greeted by a wonderful bartender (forgot her name but she was pregnant). She told us about upcoming events and about the awesome new live music they have on saturdays. We asked for taco suggestions and we got some great ones. We ended up with the Pork Adavado, Thai snapper and the shrimp. They were all amazing.  I decided to update my review because I belive that they were very deserving of it. We will definitely be back and I highly recommend  this place! !!  Thank you Kennedy Turner for taking care of the original issue and going above and beyond to make sure recaptured our business.",

I came in with a group of about 10 with a reservation made two weeks prior, and our table was not ready until about 20 minutes after the scheduled time, with no apology. Also due to the layout, there was nowhere to wait, so our big group was just milling about in front of the door trying to stay out of the way as best as possible.   The tacos were ok, but very pricey for the size of street tacos. I couldn't get anyone to refill my drink. Ultimately, if it were up to me, I would not return here, although it is a staple in Phoenix, so I imagine that I will. Maybe just for drinks.",

As the previous reviews and pictures imply, the ambience is absolutely one of the highlights of any visit here. Not only is the whole renovated church thing super neat, but they have this GINORMOUS chandelier that hangs in the middle and is a focal point right as you walk in.   I was a little disappointed with the HH selection. None of the food seemed to be discounted other than a daily special taco and one margarita was available for HH pricing. I think they maybe offer $1 off beers, but overall the HH selection was a little bit weak. It would've been nice to see some discounted apps on the list or maybe offer a wider selection of margs.   The service was spotty. The best term I can think of to describe our waiter would be aloof. We had to flag him down to order apps and when we wanted to order a second round (all our drinks were empty at the table) he only asked the two people nearest to him if they wanted another. Again, we had to flag him down after he walked away so that the rest of the table (only 6 of us) could get another drink.   I'm not a tequila buff, but this place has an extensive selection. Food-wise, there's really not much more than tacos and a few apps. I'd love to see a salad or quesadilla on the menu in the future. The food was really good I will say, I had a steak and blue cheese taco and sampled all the apps. Queso is really yummy and the guac was super fresh. The meat ball app was a bit spicy to my liking but it was still tasty.  Would come back here... But would hope to have a little bit better service",

    "text": "This place has amazing food.    For starters, I sampled their 1895 margarita, twice.  For our appetizer, we had the guacamole with pineapple mint.  I had a difficult time deciding between this one and jalapeno bacon guacamole, but I'm glad I tried this unique fusion.  The caramelized pineapples complimented the light mint flavor, and the creaminess of the guacamole smoothed it all out into one amazing little dip.  Added with the appetizer was the complimentary salsas.  The standard salsa was full of flavor.  The spicy salsa was habanero salsa, which was smokey and sweet.  I had to get some to go! For the main course, we had every taco available, excluding the taco of the day (we think!). This ended up changing my understanding of tacos altogether.  For example, the Peking duck taco was topped with fried Brie, so we had a stronger flavored meat mixed with a mild cheese.  Delicious.  My wife's favorite taco was the taco with pork and mango (al pastor pork).  My personal favorite was the pork adovada.   For dessert, we had coconut creme pie and prickly pear sorbet.  The sorbet was just right.  It wasn't saccharine by any means.  If you've had the fruit, it is just like that in flavor profile.    All in all, I'm really glad we came.  For being rated number two in the country, it's earned this position.",

Parking is alright though during busy hours like during lunch and dinner, it's certainly difficult to get parking especially with Starbucks a literal stone's throw away.   The place certainly has enough space inside though to house a good sized crowd with huge bench tables for probably a 8-12 people on the larger ones. There's also an outside covered patio which is smaller but also looks like it could hold a alright sized group.   They used to carry the Four Peaks brand of alcohol but stopped since they try to only carry local and Four Peaks sold out toe Anheuser Busch. I had a Woodchuck though and it was quite good. I prefer apple-ly stuff like Woodchuck, Strongbow or maybe a Stella Cider when I don't drink liquor. Aside from that, they still have a wide assortment of local crafted alcohol.   Food was good. I wanted the ceviche that was the chef's special for the day but since the kitchen was just about closed, I got the daily special instead which was the red chile pork tacos. They were still pretty delicious. I had three of the tacos and combined with the salsa and chips that are complimentary, I walked away quite full.   Service was fast and friendly. Place was clean and looks pretty of cool since it's built around a church...really nice stained glass windows.  I would recommend this place.",

First of all, the restaurant is set inside of an old chapel and the story of the restaurant can be found toward the end of the drink menu. I really liked the stained glass windows and huge chandelier! From the very beginning our server was very friendly and attentive. I'm a self-professed wimp when it comes to spicy food (more on the menu later), and I never had to ask for a water refill! The servers were amazing. Next, the tacos were great! I ordered the Yucatan Shrimp Taco and the Chipotle Cherry Steak Taco. Both were great! I especially liked the flavor combinations in the Chipotle Cherry Steak taco. Our group ordered a wide variety of tacos and we all said we would order them again. We also ordered an appetizer of the Fundido in addition to the complimentary chips and FOUR types of salsa!! Can't wait to go back to Taco Guild!",

The decor and atmosphere of this restaurant would absolutely hands down get 5 stars! The food on the other hand would get 3.5 stars. So I've decided to give 4 stars for Taco Guild.  The best part of my evening was the chips and array of salsas they give you to start the meal. They were all so different with their own little kick.  (Can't wait to enjoy again soon).  As for the remainder and entrees, we opted to go with the Jalapeno Bacon Fresh Made Guacamole. I will say that it was fresh but it was not that tasty for my liking. We finished with a trio of tacos - Al Pastor Pork, Tropical Ono and Grilled Seasonal Vegetable.  The tropical Ono was probably the best with flavors, but all of them lacked taste according to their descriptions. We also tried the street corn and although it was juicy it lacked flavor.   I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere at Taco Guild, job well done!",

A few candle stands and love the jukebox in between the old Methodist Church sign.  Music is very loud and upbeat and sometimes drowning for conversations.  Chips and Salsa are very good. Salsa and 3 different sauces, that go up in heat, but the salsa is still the best.  Ordered 3 street tacos pork adovado, shrimp and Peking Duck along with the corn on the cob. Out o f the street tacos, like d the Pork Adovado the best followed by the Shrimp.  Eating for happy hour is the way to go for $1.99 per taco rather than almost $5.00 per taco regularly.  Service was very good and the interior was fun and upbeat, prices were a little on the high side.   With all the mexican restaurants in town, if you want real mexican food this is not your place, if you want hip mexican food and a chic place to be seen or even take out of town guest, this is unique and a place for you.",

Don't start taking valet spots if you aren't going to start the valet yet. No apologies or solutions were offered which prompted me to immediately drive somewhere else.

The venue is stunning and the serving dishes and utensils set it apart from your average place.  -- I had always felt eating a taco was a must , but no more! I was tired of walking away over full from three tacos. I had tried all the different varieties and was not disappointed overall. Next time if I get a taco I will try lettuce instead of corn tortillas to save calories and the tortilla is not that stunning.  --The reason I say \"If I order a taco\" is because of the grilled Romaine Salad. You can add chicken or steak, but I did not.  I swear the salad tasted just like a steak. Maybe it was cooked just before the lettuce on the grill top. Either way is was delish, This salad is not to be thought of as a side or something to eat because you are on a diet. It stands alone as a meal. Paired with a beer you cannot go wrong.  --I will also put in a 'go for it' to the street corn. If I came it for a small bite and drinks this corn is the only thing I would order. Outstanding. Two could split if easily if you cut if off the cob.  --The reason for 4 stars instead of 5? The service. I wouldn't even say i expect fast service, this is a place you want to visit and linger, but constant service would be nice. Four times I have visited and each time service lagged in the areas of taking the order, refilling the drinks and checking back to see if we were done and bringing the bill. I will go back because it is close to family and easy to jump into happy hour.  --I also recommend the TACO of the day, which is half the price of a menu taco.",

Sitting at the bar is a MUST. Order the grilled romaine salad with steak , because there's so much flavor and the portion is generous. This is a place to bring friends if you're trying to wow them, and get a taste of Phoenix culture.",

We loved looking at the old stain glass windows and then talking with our Server about the history of the building.   The food was amazing. The chips were fresh and warm. My hubby is a super picky eater of tacos and he LOVED them! We each tried three different tacos! The Lamb taco was by far my favorite while my husband loved the two different pork tacos they offered! And the margaritas were pretty tasty as well!    Our server Mike made the whole experience even better. He was very helpful with everything on the menu and he was probably one of the best servers we've ever had.   I think we found our new favorite restaurant!",

We ordered the Serrano guacamole which was just average it didn't taste fresh. The chips were good, salsa was mediocre at best. There was no heat to any of them, that may be what's one people like but when I'm having Mexican food at least the salsa should have a little kick.  Then I ordered ONE al pastor beef taco, and it was served on the wrong tortilla. It was ONE taco for Petes sake!  The rest of my party had been having frozen margaritas and had had 2 already, their third one was brought out on the rocks.   Service isn't the greatest and their food is mediocre. I'm giving them two stars because at least the place itself was cute, quaint setting in an old church but definitely not enough to come back.",

Happy hour margarita was alright, nothing special. Ordered four tacos. One was amazeballs- the lamb. Wish I had just ordered that four times. The daily taco was pretty good too. The other two were decent but forgettable. The corn tortillas were pretty thick and chewy; not my favorite texture. And the side of veggies were mushy and didn't even taste like they had salt on them. The service was great.   Summary: cool interior; okay drinks; decent tacos; amazing lamb; horrible music; good service",

    "text": "I remember having gone to this place a few years ago when they newly opened and being amazed! I had dropped in a few times for lunch, and it was always amazing, we were thoroughly satisfied. But this last visit, which was for dinner, was completely underwhelming. Not only was management and the staff lackluster, but the quality of the food was subpar (compared to previous experiences). They made it seem as though it was a huge inconvenience to accommodate a party if 8-10 persons, and wouldn't seat us until the entire party arrived, even though we expressed that we would be ordering throughout the wait. The manager basically rolled his eyes at the request of us being seated, mind you, it was a Tuesday night and the restaurant was at about 50% capacity, so we expressed frustration. Now onto the food, besides the service taking longer than it did for us to be seated, once we got the apps, nothing tasted fresh. Everything tasted as though it had been sitting under a heat lamp for houses, oh and did I mention that they decided to tell us three minutes before 10pm, that the regular menu ended at 10? (our reservation was for 9:30, we weren't seated until 9:50). Yeah, even though I called in advance to confirm their kitchen would be open late, which the hostess failed to mention had its conditions. Even the tacos (because what else were we there for?) tasted the same as the apps, dated and dry. I was saddened by the realization that what was once one of my favorite gourmet taco shops, had been, or is continuing to be run to the ground. They have not changed a single thing on their menu since their opening back in late 2013. Needless to say, we will not be returning. I generously gave them a 2 star rating, vs what would have been 5 stars back in late 2013, early 2014, for not truly expressing concern or care for us, and the lack of progressive efforts.",

Tacos are really good but I would avoid the rice.  Seems to be always under cooked and dry.  Quite a shame because a side would be nice.  Instead Order a salad.    Beautiful and unique building.  They recently added music on Fri and Sat nights.   ( ok for kids but would suggest not)  Local favorite hangout for me.",

My favorite is the braised beef taco on a flour tortilla. As for sides, the house salad and red beans are great choices.

Speaking of mouthfuls the Chirizo meatballs are certainly a fantastic way to stuff your face. The nectar of the gods (beer) slaw is also stellar. The Atmosphere is great here, really cool vibe and the live music on the weekends adds to that a lot. Oh yeah, service- also solid. The Hot Sauces were great, but let's get to the places namesake, tacos. The Steak n' Blu, though not traditional, is one of the best modern fusion tacos I have ever had. The Coffee Beef was also good, but if you are going to go just one beef, try the Steak n Blu first. The Pork was all right, little dry, but the flavors were there! Did I mention the hot sauce? I'm a bit of a fiend for hot sauce, and this stuff really impressed me, which is hard to do in this category. I mean I make about 20 bottles of 12 varieties of hot sauce a year from peppers I grow, plus have a dedicated cupboard in my kitchen to purchased hot sauces. So for me to say a hot sauce is good-- that means something.   I'll be back.",

The menu is small and everything is made fresh from organic or local businesses.  You get chips and 4 types of salsa while you wait.   I had the beef taco and the shrimp taco.   Both were good but I think the beef was my favorite, I was a little worried about the description of the mango pico de gallo on top but the mango was not overpowering and the beef had excellent flavor.  The shrimp one had a little too much house made cabbage salad on top, so the dressing, cabbage to shrimp ratio was off a bit for me.",

    "text": "So I finally checked out Taco a Guild after reading an article that it was voted one of top 10 taco restaurants In America. Couldn't believe that I was holding out so long. Plus I heard that it was at an old restored church. Super cool!  Came on a Sunday night and sat down at the bar. It was happy hour all night so I ordered a local beer and my wife had the house Margarita. Both very good. I love local breweries and was happy to see that Taco Guild carried all local taps. Went with Historic's Pie Hole Porter. See my review  View of Historic Brewery in Flagstaff for more on that brewery!  We shared the 3 taco plate. Went with the cherry steak, shrimp, and pastor. All three were amazing with the cherry steak being my favorite. Wife liked the shrimp the best but you can't go wrong with any of them. If you order 3 tacos you get a free side which we chose the rice. Also when we sat at the bar we were served chips and salsa which was really good. All the salsa's were tasty and the chips were quality.   What I really liked best with Taco Guild was the building. You can read all the reviews on here but it's really cool that it's in an old church. The bar was the alter and they kept the stained glass windows. I took a few photos of the inside and share them on Yelp.   I was really impressed with Taco Guild. I can't wait to show my out if town friends and family that Phoenix does in fact have some quirky and unique restaurants. I can't wait till I come back for the food and the ambience.",

Could have had a little more spice for my taste which would add more flavor. The disappointment came as half my meatballs were soaked in the pickled beet juice which my severe disdain for beets prevented me from fully enjoying. The street corn looked amazing and did make me wish I had went that route.",

Our hummus appetizer (combo of hummus, guacomole, and roasted peppers) was pasty and bland.  We mentioned this to the waiter and his response was \"It's not our most popular item.  We're thinking of removing it from the menu\" (really?).  As for the tacos, they were a decent size but were cold when we received them and dry and bland.  The duck taco had a strange mid eastern spice to it and the lamb taco was served with bleu cheese (very odd).  I left almost all my dinner on the plate.  My husband, who has a very healthy appetite, is not a picky eater, and always cleans his plate had a few bites and left the rest.  We will definitely not be back to Taco Guild.",

Amazing chips and salsa, amazing tacos, great atmosphere- the fact that it used to be a church adds to the ambiance and just puts it a notch above all of the other Mexican food restaurants in the area. My only complaint is parking- it's in a small center with a Starbucks so parking spaces are limited. Get there early enough to get a table and you'll get a space, but wait until \"traditional\" dining times and you'll be circling the lot for days. But that food though....",

    "text": "I've made three visits here with family and friends, and will be back again.    The good:  It's a great concept.  They converted the old Bethel Methodist Church into an eatery.  They kept the stained glass, added some \"Reformation\" murals, and obviously made an effort to respect the architecture and history.  Kudos putting the bar at the altar - an ironic twist.  It's a great little strip center, with Buffalo Exchange right next door.  Parking sucks when it's busy, but it's a safe surrounding neighborhood.  More good:  The taco menu is creative and many of the taco choices are genuinely tasty, if (as others have noted) some are a little bland - the salsa choices help remedy this.  The \"taco of the day\" and \"three taco\" plate are great introductions, but it's worth a couple of visits to branch out and try a broad range of the traditional and fusion choices: the coffee-braised beef, chipotle cherry steak and peking duck tacos were unexpected, and absolutely delicious.    OK:  Waitstaff are friendly but service suffers a little when the place gets crowded.  It's like they haven't fully grasped just how popular they've become and don't schedule / scale their staffing to match the crowds.  First visit wasn't long after they'd opened, and I figured they'd adjust.  Second and third visits (most recently a few months ago) were a little better.  Service, especially at the host counter, has never been what I'd call \"attentive.\"  Not-so-good:  \"Street Corn\" (Elote) is a very specific thing (albeit with lots of seasoning variances from place to place ...); it is not executed well here.  Twice now, it has been dry, food-bank quality corn, overcooked and slathered with a nasty mayonnaise and not much else.  If, as the menu claims, cotija cheese is involved in the preparation, they must wave the block over the top and move on.  This could be a \"signature\" menu offering if it was done as well as, say, the 20 or so recipes I found on a web search just now.  Don't go cheap on this, guys.  Start with fresh corn, make a quality sauce with actual garlic and herbs and good chili, and *roll* the hot corn in the crumbled cheese to make it stick - don't scrimp!  Also Not-so-good:  The noise level in this place is - at best - not conducive to conversation.  At worst (e.g. during the Friday night DJ sets), it is genuinely hazardous.  Live music and / or a DJ are great, but this is a midtown gastropub, not a Scottsdale hip-hop dance club.  Turn the volume down and consider installing some dampeners (some banners would be cool ...) up in the roof structure to mitigate some of the echo.  Back to where I started:  I'll be back,and I'll bring friends and out-of-towners!  This is a great concept, with a wonderful setting and many gems on the menu, which reaches the \"good\" level in execution.",

I had the one with lamb and blue cheese it was amazing!!  I was super excited about the chips and salsa, you get a larger bowl of tradiational salsa and three smaller ones that are a bit hotter and all were absolutely declicious.

    "text": "2.5 stars  Conceptually, Taco Guild is really cool. It's an old church converted into a modern day eatery. The interior is dope because it still retains the old stained glass pertinent to the church.   The food. Meh. Meh. Meh.  My sister and I both did taco plates where you can order 3 tacos and get a free side and/or tack on a street corn for $2.50.  We ordered the following tacos:  -al pastor pork ($3.95): grilled pork, jalapeno bacon + pickled red onion -urban bean coffee braised beef ($4.95): caramelized onion, mango jicama relish, Cotija cheese -Yucatan shrimp ($3.95): green cabbage slaw, avocado -chipotle cherry steak ($4.95): poblano straws, chile aioli, bleu cheese -peking duck ($4.95): plum sauce, fire-roasted poblano apricot compote, Brie cheese -tropical ono (($4.95): menonita cheese, roasted-tomato salsa, coconut slaw, mango, tomato, cilantro  The good: the coffee braised beef + Yucatan shrimp - good flavor and fluid in taste.  The okay: the al pastor + cherry steak - good, but not memorable. The bleu cheese on that steak taco was no bueno because it basically overpowered the steak.  The bad, bad: the peking duck had this congesting aromatic flavor after every bite. It was overwhelming and unappetizing. The ono also bordered on gross because the coconut slaw was a bit too sweet and too much.  The real downer? The corn. Our corn was overcooked or something because it possessed an unsavory dark yellow tint, which we thought was odd. After shaving the corn off and mixing it with the condiments, it was inedible - pretty gross. My sister justified it by saying that perhaps corn was no longer in season?, but after glancing at other tables, our corn was clearly an anomaly - other people had normal looking corn.  We're from LA., so 5 dollar priced tacos are digestable, but if I'm paying that much for a taco, the ingredients better be top notch. And, be forewarned - the tacos are substantially much smaller than they photograph.",

Normally this would be enough for me to leave but we drove an hour to try this place so we carried on. Then the flies arrived. They were landing on our straws, our chips, and our hands while we were desperately trying our best to enjoy this place. One of the items on the menu we were looking forward to was the street corn. It didn't taste fresh and reminded me of old corn you give to livestock. It was lacking in sweetness and the butter/cheese/mayo stuff that it comes in didn't help. The waiter sold me a drink that he compared to an apple mule, but it was made with tequila not vodka so this was yet another surprise and disappointment.   I'm always on the lookout for new and interesting places to try, places I can take friends and family.....but I think I'm gonna scratch this one off the list. Simply too many things going wrong to consider giving it another shot.   On a positive note, the inside of the church is beautiful. Our waiter was OK.

Imagine an actual church turned into a restaurant. That was about the extent of it though, you would think with the name \"Taco Guild\" this would be the place for tacos, NOT!!! Ordered two tacos both being El Pastor tacos which took about twenty five minutes to come out, only to find them to be cold and bland. I didn't bother complaining wasn't worth my time, I'll never visit again. How hard is it to make a taco.",

All were phenomenal! I love how fresh the mahi mahi was, and that it wasn't breaded. The flavour was amazing. The Peking duck taco had such interesting flavors - really good spices to it. Had both tacos with the lettuce cups, instead of tortillas, and it was fantastic. I love that they have options.  Also had the 'burning bush' cocktail - and it was stellar. Not sweet. Not spicy. Just perfect.  Would recommend this place to anyone!!",

Definitely on the weak side and pale red mix never boads well. Christmas style taste like a limade. Was told they came with an special hard boiled egg. Did not. However chef made us two deviled eggs with a chorizo topping. This needs to be on the starter menu. Had the enchiladas. Meh not enough meat. Tortilla turned to soup. Had the taco trio as well. Not bad. Little pricey for what you get. Needs some seasoning.",

They remind of someone who is throwing things in at the last minute in attempts to cover up mistakes. I ordered the shrimp taco, which included rubberized cooked shrimp which tasting without the mess of toppings was flavorless ( I think it was $5 which was $4.75 more than it should have cost.) The tortillas just don't have that vibe of authenticity you can get from about 1000 other places in Phoenix. I know I'm in the minority here but the food is just not worth the wait, (it's the Applebee's of a Friday night place)   Yes it's an old church,which  does not improve food. The surfaces of the interior are all hard surfaces, coupled with folks ability to play DJ, the vibe is more 'hey look at this place I found' vs. 'I want to show you some great food/time that phoenix has'   Skip for other more awesomeness places.",

    "text": "I have lived about a mile away from Taco Guild for about a year and a half and earlier this month I decided to finally give it a shot. We decided to go on a Sunday morning for brunch and we had really heard a lot of hype about this place. The first and most memorable part of my visit here was how cool the building was, which prompted me to read about its history. Pretty neat!  We got seated and ended up waiting for quite some time before we were greeted by our server. When he came to take our drink and appetizer orders he seemed to be somewhat overwhelmed, but we put our order in for the street corn and drinks and sat back and talked. After about 10 minutes we got our drinks and chips, and shortly after received our appetizer and put our food orders in. I asked for a recommendation and told him the breakfast hash sounded good, so I ordered that and my fiancee ordered the chicken enchiladas.   We were happy to see that our food order had arrived until I saw that my order was completely wrong, which was frustrating because I had spoken to the server about it and he recommended it to me. He promptly apologized and sent it back to only get the order wrong, again. At this point my fiancee had finished half of her food and I was frustrated and ate it. Our server came back with the bill and had taken off my food from the bill, which was very nice and professional of him and the restaurant.   I came away very disappointed, especially after hearing over a year of rave reviews and recommendations for this place. I would be willing to try Taco Guild again, as the number and quality of reviews shows that it must be good, but I really hope that it is isn't this much of a disappointment again.",

The cod fish was ok a bit fishy.  The Koren fried chicken taco was ok if you like chicken nuggets from KFC drizzled with sweet and sour sauce topped with greenery. And to top it off the table beside us took his floss out and proceeded to start his oral hygiene early and in public.  Service was good and so was margarita . Overall to pricey for mediocrity.

First off, it's in an old church so the building is beyond cool with stained glass windows, cathedral ceilings, big wooden doors, chandeliers, etc. I came straight from the gym so I ordered my meal to-go from the bar, but I'm very sad I didn't stay to dine! They have a full bar and a variety of table-side guacs and I feel like I missed out (guess I'll have to return!!) They also have patio dining- I never met a patio I didn't like....  I ordered my To-Go meal from the bartender who was pleasant and gave me the low down and recommendations. I got the taco platter- with 3 tacos (you can pick any 3) and 1 side. I chose Ono (fish), shrimp, and chicken with a side of their street corn off the Cobb. Food arrived promptly and they even threw in a chips & salsa order without me asking. A+ Service!   Everything was YUM! The corn tortillas were handmade and every taco had amazing, individualized flavor! And that Street corn..no words!! I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Best. Tacos. Ever.  I came here during my most recent trip to Phoenix. I had done a little bit of research ahead of time to find places that had been dubbed the \"Best Mexican in Phoenix\" and came across Taco Guild. Boy did it live up to the hype.   Upon arrival, we were quickly seated at the back patio and given chips with four incredible salsas. It was happy hour so I of course ordered one of their $6 margaritas (definitely recommend!). I already knew I was going to order their taco plate special (order three tacos, get a free side), but it took me a few minutes to pick just three tacos from their amazing lists of \"old world\" and \"new world\" tacos. I finally settled on the pastor from their \"old world\" tacos (pastor pork with grilled pineapple, jalapeno bacon, pickled red onion), and the chipotle cherry steak (poblano straws, chile aioli, bleu cheese) and peking duck (plum sauce, fire-roasted poblano apricot compote, brie cheese) from their \"new world\" taco list.  Oh. My. God. These tacos BLEW MY MIND. The marinade on the pastor pork permeated every little bit of the meat so it was absolutely packed with flavor. The salty bacon with the tartness of the pickled onion and sweetness of the pineapple was sheer perfection. The steak in the chipotle cherry steak was also marinated wonderfully, and was SO tender. I often get beef that's overcooked in my tacos, and was so happy this was still on the medium rare to medium side. It had a slight charred flavor to boot. I LOVED the poblano straws for a bit of crunch, with cooling bleu cheese crumbled on top. The peking duck was like nothing I've ever had. The brie was actually lightly fried which was an awesome surprise, and provided a nice contrast with the sweetness of the apricot compote and sweet plum marinate for the duck. The duck was tender and delicious. All the tacos were wrapped in a fluffy, homemade corn tortilla. So yummy. I really enjoyed the achiote flavored rice too.  My mom ordered chicken enchiladas and said they were some of the best she's ever had. They were made with white meat chicken but the meat was so juicy--not easy to do with white meat. They also packed a lot of flavor. She also particularly liked the variety of salsas, which were actually spicy (not like the wimpy salsas we're used to in the Pacific Northwest!).  I can't recommend Taco Guild enough. I will ABSOLUTELY be back during my next trip to Phoenix.",

    "text": "It's hard for me to give a comprehensive review of Taco Guild when I only ordered a couple of their tacos, but here's my take after my first visit:  First, it's an engaging atmosphere. An old church restored and reclaimed into a hip (and decidedly upscale) restaurant. Hip, to be sure, with an even hipper menu of artistic tacos and other Mexican items like burritos and enchiladas. I like how their menu is small - doing fewer menu items and doing them well resonates for me. They have a daily taco - which is only available after 2 pm (except for Taco Tuesday, when it's available all day...I know, it gets a little confusing...). They also have a daily soup and happy hour, where the prices go down to a bit more reasonable, at least by my standards. We stuck with the tacos for lunch. I did appreciate that you can order your tacos with either corn or flour tortillas or just go with lettuce as your wrap.  I ordered Yucatan grilled shrimp and al pastor. We also tried the molida lamb and coffee-braised beef. I mostly tasted the pickled onions in the al pastor tacos but the pork was moist and had a wonderful sweet flavor; the grilled shrimp tacos lacked any sort of flavor for me - even after adding some of their delicious jalapeno salsa, they were just bland - to my tastes. I love the assortment of salsas and fresh chips they bring to the table after you arrive. I think I'd like to return perhaps for happy hour or Taco Tuesday to try a few other tacos - I'm sure I'll be able to find one or two tacos that become my favorites! All in all a fun place to visit.",

    "text": "Happened into Taco Guild late on a Tuesday night, and we weren't disappointed.  The building itself appears to be an old church, or modeled to look like one. The murals and stained glass are gorgeous, as are the exposed beams and old-world feel.  My brother ordered a burrito and I ordered the three taco plate, each of us added the corn as a side. He really enjoyed the burrito and corn, and had left overs as the helpings were pretty big. I ordered the veggie, ono, and coffee braised beef. The veggie and ono were delish, I have the beef to my brother (as I wasn't that hungry). I was expecting small street tacos, but they were actually pretty large portions. I personally did not like the corn's flavor.   Our waitress was extremely helpful, despite it being late. She even sent us home with to go drinks and extra salsa!",

The guac was boring, couldn't taste the lime or cilantro. The veggie tacos lacked flavor and were a little cold. I brought home the leftovers to doctor them up. The price tag for the 2 of us with tip was $48. Could have gone to Chipotle several times and been very pleased.  The ambience was cool.",

The margaritas were very good, but the descriptions of the drinks were so overwhelming that we just asked the waiter to recommend us drinks.   I liked the corn tortilla flavor, but I was disappointed in the flavor of the tacos. They had good descriptions, but I didn't find the taco flavors to match their descriptions, meaning the tacos flavor was a bit of a let down from the awesome sounding descriptions. The cherry steak taco had little to no cherry flavor. The coffee braised beef had an impressive amount of beef.   Overall: come for the atmosphere and drinks and you won't regret it.",

That flavor and texture combination was perfect! I'm bummed they made the duck into a standard taco  w/tomatoes and cotija cheese :(  Duck deserves better. The lamb taco tasted great but looks a bit unappetizing. The sharp taco had wonderful flavor. Of course the street corn was amazing, and the Happy Hour margarita was so smooth and yummy! Just bring back the cherry duck w/fried Brie!",

I couldn't stop looking around at all the cool features. LOVE the stained glass windows and giant candle chandelier that hangs over the center of the room. We ordered our food, and about 30 minutes passed. Then the waitress came by to tell us that the kitchen was slammed and our food would be a bit longer. Another 10-15 minutes later, our food came out, but not all at once.  The food itself was very good. We couldn't stop eating the freshly made chips and salsa that they brought out. I got the pork and beef tacos with a side of corn, and my boyfriend got the chicken burrito. Everything tasted fresh and authentic. The tacos are really small, and I could have eaten at least 1 more. The waitress came over after our meal to let us know that our meal was totally on the house because of the long, ridiculous wait. She sat down with us for a minute to explain that they had just opened up (we were aware of that) and really weren't prepared for such a busy lunch hour. I really appreciated her taking the time to apologize and explain things. I told her that we understood and would definitely be back to try them again. Overall: Cool place, great tasting Mexican food, but they are still working out some kinks with the service/kitchen so don't expect a quick lunch experience.",

There wasn't anywhere to sit at the bar so we waited outside.  Wait quoted was accurate.  Once we were seated we ordered drinks (a beer and a margarita) and the chorizo meatballs.  The server also brought chips and a selection of salsas.  Meatballs were good- spicy, but we were expecting that.  My husband got the steak burrito and really enjoyed it.  I ordered 3 tacos (in order of preference): beef, al pastor, and duck.  If I visit again I'll stick with the beef tacos which were very good.  We also got the signature corn, we were not blown away by it.  Service was decent and the manager stopped by our table to check on us. The setting in an old church is a neat idea, but I am not sure if it was just an ugly church or if the restaurant ironically redecorated.  The stained glass and murals are gaudy.",

When i walked inside to go to the bathroom I realized how LOUD it was inside. They definitely need to work on the acoustics to make it more personal for each table.

However, the concept is a bit poorly executed. The music selections were odd and clashing. Our server was nervous and redundant. For example, when I ordered a water: \"Would you like a straw? Or lemon? Or both?\" It was just an awkward way of asking.  The bathrooms are not clearly marked. I watched as several men walked into the women's restroom without knowing it. All of this would have been fine if the food were good, which unfortunately, it wasn't. My chicken taco had cold kidney beans on it, which were highly unappetizing. My husband ordered 3 small tacos, each of which left him underwhelmed. I'm not trying to be overly critical of a new restaurant, in fact, I badly want them to succeed! But right now, Gadzooks is the better Mexican place on that block (Osborn/7th).",

    "text": "Taco Guild seems to focus more on style than substance.  The building itself is beautiful.  I love restaurants that are inside old houses, so a restaurant in an old church is right up my alley.  I admit I was confused by the decor choice of having Dutch paintings in a taco restaurant and Johnny Cash playing on the jukebox, but once I got past that odd juxtaposition, I decided I liked it.  The giant chandelier is amazing, the bar is gorgeous, the stained glass is really pretty, etc, etc.  The food however, was the opposite of all the complimentary words in the previous sentence.  I like fancy tacos.  The tacos here are overpriced and extremely basic, despite all the frou-frou words on the menu describing them.  The prices are extremely high for the amount of food you get.  For $3.95 each (some are even $4.95 with more \"premium\" ingredients,) you receive basically four bites of taco.  I don't mind paying almost $4 for a taco, but when I'm shelling out, I expect the taco shell to be filled out, if you catch my drift.  My al pastor taco at Taco Guild arrived at my plate with a meager amount of pork and some sad looking pickled onions.  Allegedly there was pineapple and jalapeno bacon as well, but I didn't notice either.  I also ordered the coffee braised beef taco, which strangely had loads more meat on it than the al pastor, but was really lacking in flavor.  The meat was dry and the cotija cheese was kind of an odd accompaniment.  My dining companions both really enjoyed their chicken tacos, so perhaps I just made the wrong choice or they have bad taste.  The free chips were my favorite thing about the meal.  They were really good!!  Lightly salted, not greasy at all, and served warm.  The salsa was eh, but oh, I ate LOTS of those chips.  Service-wise, we were greeted and seated immediately, our server was attentive, and we were thanked numerous times as we left the restaurant.  Essentially I enjoyed everything about our experience except the food, which should really be the core of one's restaurant experience.  I'd maybe come back here for a drink, because the bar and interior atmosphere is truly very cool.  For a good fancy taco that is worth the upcharge, go to Gallo Blanco or even America's Taco Shop.  Still pricy for street tacos, but definitely higher quality filler than you'll get at Taco Guild.",

    "text": "I've been stalking Taco Guild for months now. Every time I'd go to Starbucks next door, I'd creep on Taco Guild, snapping pics of the structure and the dope typography on the wall. Being sure, of course, to upload it on Instagram and hash-tag it with things like #omgtacos #imadesigner #typographynerd #wheredemtacos. So as you can imagine, when they finally opened, I was quite excited and had high hopes for the restaurant.  First of all, there was a lot of meticulous thought put into this entire concept. Being a designer/art director, I know what it takes to maintain a level of consistency throughout a restaurant. This place was just excellent in terms of execution and aesthetic. The actual building itself was gorgeous, and I'm a huge sucker for stained glass windows. Everything from the logo, to the murals, to the design of the menu - color me impressed. Which is the color of chartreuse, I heard. Anyway, we all know why I really went - to stuff my chipmunk cheeks with savory tacos. You can have awesome design, but the food is key (duh). I started off with the chips and salsa - pretty standard, good salsa. Whatevs. I was particularly hungry, so I ordered 3 tacos and 2 sides. I had the peking duck, molida lamb, and guild chicken with a side of red beans and grilled corn. The tacos were very delicious, I loved the unique toppings and flavors to all 3. My favorite however was definitely the lamb. The sides didn't disappoint either, both were packed with flavor and by the time I had consumed everything, I was quite plump and happy. There was no way I could eat any more food and...oh what's that? You have a prickly pear sorbet? Sure I'll take that as well. This turned out to be an excellent idea, as it was the perfect amount of sweetness to satisfy my sweet tooth.   So why the 4 stars instead of 5, Lindi K.? Cause I felt like it yo! Just kidding. It's because I felt the food was a wee bit overpriced (but not surprised by this) and because the tacos weren't as good as Taqueria Los Yaquis, which is literally $1 for a taco. Although, Taco Guild does have a bar...bonus. No matter though, the entire concept was impressive and I had a lovely time there. I think this place will do very well.",

The tequila pork and the chicken taco they put up were IMO, the best ones I had all day. I spent some time chatting with one of the reps at the tent about the food and how they do things and was pretty enthused about house made salsa, seeing as how everyone has their own version. The tequila menu would be a big draw for those looking to step out of the Patron/Cuervo repertoire, but I like that they now offer a special where if you buy a regular entree, you get a penny Margarita! I am looking forward to visiting the home location and seeing just how they stack up against my taco testing to urge zones when they have a full kitchen.",

The atmosphere is very welcoming from the moment you are greeted to when you leave. If you are a fan of lamb meat as a source of protein their lamb tacos are a MUST TRY!!! Seriously I've been to numerous Mediterranean places and Taco Guild is head and shoulders above the competition. The Peeking duck has a very unique texture and taste as well but back to the lamb...if you have ever ate lamb and haven't tried this place you have NOT experienced life yet. Same goes for if you have eaten tacos but not at this establishment, you are missing out! I'm here in Phoenix for work but if I ever lived here I'd be a regular at this establishment. Did I mention the local craft brews? Large selection from blondes, ales, lagers, and pilsners to stouts, browns, and IPAs you name it they have it. Great service as well even on a busy night my food was prepped and served in less than 10 minutes maybe even faster. How this place does not have 5 stars for every review I do not know. Must have gotten a bad bartender or server but don't let that steer you away from this amazing place. Just for a little piece of history..this place is an old Church...how cool is that? Next time you go out for tacos and you don't chose taco guild you should probably slap yourself. Don't make the mistake I did of not coming here on the first day of my visit in Phoenix.",

By the time he came around to ask for an appetizer order we were already losing patience. The food took forever to hit the table. The food was mediocre and the service didn't help. We had to ask several different people to fill our waters and were only checked on once which was when we asked for the check.

The atmosphere is well worth the visit. Beautiful stained glass windows abound with a very high ceiling and murals on the high walls create an almost Gothic surreal feel.   The food on the pallet is clearly Spanish fusion, something I'd describe as southwestern/New Mexico with a splash of Mexico. The street corn on the cob is magnificent. The salsa fresh and original. The food has a delicious smokey flare as if cooked over and open camp fire. The cost is appropriate. The bathrooms immaculate. Service outstanding. If your looking for spicy flare ask for more of  homemade house brand hot sauces - dishes are on the mild spicy side, but not  without flavor. There is a bar there and they advertise craft beers, but I don't drink so I don't even know what a \"craft\" beer is! Bonn Apatite!",

I shared the chorizo meat balls with my friend (it came with 6 and a pile of shredded beets), the sauce was sweet and savory with leafy bites of cilantro. I often find anything with chorizo to be too salty, but it was just right, especially with the sweet sauce pairing. They have the healthy option to get lettuce wraps instead of corn or flour tortillas, and seeing as there was an abundant amount of free chips and salsa, I didn't miss having a tortilla-the lettuce was perfect! The free salsa and chips also came with three smaller and unique tasting salsas/sauces that varied in flavor and spiciness-it was awesome to have variety. To top of the great food and service, the atmosphere was amazing. I loved the high ceilings and stained glass, a huge rustic chandelier and beautiful well kept bathrooms. I will definitely be back!",

The tacos are authentic and pretty tasty. The house margarita is a decent one. They do serve chips and salsa with every meal. However it does get super busy, if you're trying to go for happy hour on a Friday-you will have to wait at least 30 minutes.   I don't know that I will come back here too often because there are too many other places that I can get a taco and a marg for a better price.",

Located in an old, repurposed church, Taco Guild has a cool vibe with stunning decor.  I'm not much of a taco eater, but I obviously had to order some while hear. I wasn't in love, but they were good. I loved the chips and salsas they bring you before your meal. The salsas had varying temperatures and all were delicious. I also tried the corn which was amazing and I loved that they gave you the option to get the corn off the cob (less messy!)  Overall a fun place. Could definitely see myself coming back if I'm ever in the area again.",

Sat at the bar and the service was the best they checked in with us but not annoying and very friendly.  The food we very good we had 1 special taco if the day habanero chicken taco it was good the chick was a little dry and not as much flavor as I personally would like and cherry steak was delicious very flavorful and the meant was juicy!  The chips are excellent not super greasy and very fresh the salsa was great flavor and I enjoy the three other sauces they give with it. All three very different and tasty. We also tried the chicken enchiladas with rice. The enchiladas could of use a little more sauce but the flavor was tasty and the rice was good  enjoyed the add in corn and celery etc.  The corn tortillas are fresh I just wish they could make the taco shells crispy but it will not stop me from going back! Definitely need to go down the menu and try everything.",

The chorizo meatballs from the appetizer menu are also amazing with a sweet and spicy glaze. The cocktail drinks are really good. They give you main table salsa but also three specialty salsas that are amazing- I especially love the vinegar carrot one.   Fun atmosphere, live music occasionally. Highly recommend!",

It's situated in an old church so the vibe inside is really cool.  Dark, high ceilings, like an old gothic cathedral.  The tacos were on point as well with a lot of meat and good flavors.  My only draw back was the time it took just for 2 tacos to come out was a little long.  The tacos were also a tad on the expensive side, 5 and up, but for gourmet fancy tacos I guess it makes since.",

There was live music, the two person band was taking requests for songs which was fun. The food options were great, but my husband and I specifically went to try their tacos. We each ordered a taco plate which came with 3 tacos and a side. We decided to get all 6 different tacos and shared to try as many as we could. The least favorite was the Mahi Mahi. I feel as though the fish lacked flavor and seasoning. The best taco was the molida lamb (I'll probably order three of these next time we go). Service was average, nothing out of the ordinary but no complaints. Why did I rate it 4 stars and not 5 you ask? Because i find it very difficult to find tacos that compare to Mexico City tacos :)",

Getting a table on a Friday night can be a bit difficult and you may have to wait a while but they've made it a bit easier to order drinks to help pass the time!   On Friday, the background music was a solo guitar player/singer doing covers and he was SO good!   But my vary favorite part is the ambiance and the building this gem of a restaurant is in! This old early 1800's church is gorgeous with stained glass windows, giant chandeliers, and would details! Just beautiful",

    "text": "A new drink menu just opened today. This calls for a cocktail.   My server, Tommy, was at the ready with recommendations and a friendly smile. He was knowledgeable about the spice factor in both tacos and drinks.   Apps: ordered the ceviche but it never arrived. Not sure if the server forgot or just didn't hear me; or maybe he was distracted by my sweet smile. Either way, I'm kind of glad because with the hefty complimentary serving of chips and salsa, I had more than enough to eat.   Drinks: arrived after my meal but it was also put in after I ordered my food. Into dress the Serpent. A close replacement for a Moscow Mule, the cucumber and ginger fusion is a refreshing choice for a hot day. At $10, I'd be happy to have a second or third.   Main dish (Taco Apovada): I went against Tommy's recommendation for the Al Pastor taco (he indicated spicey and I'm kind of a whimp). The Apovada had my attention with the jicama salsa. It was good for sure (the Salsa) but was a smidge on the dry side. Maybe a touch more salsa would help or some type of a drizzle. The corn tortilla was thick!   Atmosphere: it was a little chilly inside but that is typical the warming AZ temps. Music was going, typical bar noise from where I sat. At 130 pm, the place was busy but not packed. Bar was full but I was sat quickly at a high top bar adjacent. I enjoyed the atmosphere very much. A fun place to have a lunch by yourself and people watch, work (as I was doing) or with a friend / date.  Restrooms: clean as a whistle after the lunch rush. This is always a good sign to me of a well-run restaurant.   Cost: a skinny girls lunch: $15.69 for one drink, one taco, and complimentary chips and salsa.   Side note: I was a smidge thrown off by the tweety bird plate but I'm all for keeping it light and reducing / reusing in this world!   All in all, definitely heck this place out for lunch or a post work bite! You won't be disappointed.",

We ordered the three taco plate with a substitute for street corn as our side and the food was very satisfying and we enjoyed being adventurous with our meat selection. My girlfriend ordered a horchata and a mango margarita. The margarita was disguised with sugar coating around the rim however upon picking up the glass, my girlfriend was pierced with loose shards and began bleeding. A concerned wait staff approached and promptly sent over management to see if we needed any assistance. He offered a bandage and ointment and we appreciated the concern. We finished our meal after having our drinks replaced and even ran into a friend. Although a complementary drink was not offered, I would have assumed the blood soaked napkin my girlfriend was using would be more than enough to get a meal comp. Instead my bill was rung up at full price and drinks were charged in full. An active bleed caused by a lackadaisical wait staff and a poorly managed restaurant has left me with a bad taste in my mouth and glass shards literally in my girlfriends fingers. As we prepare out spring 2019 food blog we will be sure to leave your restaurant out of the listings. Needless to say that is my last supper at the taco guild.",

The salsas that come with chips are fab and come in varying heat levels. We consumed the Taco of the Day and it was quite delicious. They are only $2.50 or $3 dollars each. This haunt sports a nice bar small patio adjacent the front of the building. Located next to the Buffalo Exchange lends to fun after dinner shopping. It is worth a visit for sure. #vinosquared #vino2ultimate",

    "text": "The service at Taco Guild was really good. I went with my boyfriend yesterday at 5pm and we were seated right away. They served us nachos that were nice and warm with 4 choices of sauces. I ordered 3 tacos (al pastor pork, pork adovada, Yucatan shrimp) that got me a free side (I chose salad). My boyfriend ordered a burrito and he also got the free side salad. I'm a picky eater and I'm not a fan of onions and cilantro so I asked for the cilantro on the side for the pork adovada. Our server, Candice, mentioned that the cilantro was mixed in with the pico and that the al pastor pork taco also had cilantro. I told her it was fine to leave it in if it was too complicated. When the tacos arrived, I was pleasantly surprised that she had remembered to separate out the cilantro for me.  My favorite taco was the al pastor pork. The pork adovada was a bit dry so that was my least favorite. The Yucatan shrimp taco was good but I didn't find it as satisfying as the al pastor pork taco since it felt like it was mostly slaw.   In the end our server Candice was able to get us a to-go container for one of the nacho sauces that we really liked.   Overall my experience at Taco Guild was great. It was my first time seeing a restaurant in an old church building which made for a unique experience. The service and food were great.",

The menu was very limited and they barley had any main entrees.  3. The taco menu was just okay. Considering taco is in the name of the restaurant.  4. The happy hour menu was HORRIBLE! The only food item on the menu was the Daily taco. Today's daily taco was BBQ chicken. Mmmm no shanks I'll pass on that.  5. I ordered the taco guild chicken and the shrimp taco. I make better chicken tacos at home and the shrimp taco was not good at all. The shrimp was soooo cold. We sent back our shrimp tacos and they were removed.  6. The margarita was basic and there was only one margarita on the happy menu hour for $5.95 for cheap tequila. Doesn't really sound like a deal to me.   The positives: 1. The elote was AMAAAZZZZIIINNGGGG. Literally the best thing here.  2. The chips and salsas were good.   It's safe to say I definitely won't be back.",

Hopping Happy Hour, Live Music, Crazy Good menu, Creamy blended Margaritas, Amazing waitress (Rebecca - This is your chance to ask for a raise / bonus), and that man who makes it all happen (Jason - Marissa already said you are amazing).  We were visiting Phoenix for our daughters graduation from Grand Canyon University.  (We hail from San Diego, so we know a little something about good Mexican food.)  Anyway, we figured that as a special celebration dinner that our daughter would choose a fancy place like the Biltmore.  Even though we don;t have a ton of money, we would have splurged on a place like the Biltmore.  (Shh.  Don't tell our daughter but the bill for 6 people with drinks was under $100.)  Our daughter came up with the idea to come here.  Good call to our genius daughter that graduates Cum Laude in 2 1/2 years!!!  We ordered several of the corn on the cob and my mother, who attended boarding school in Mexico as a child, had the biggest Cotija Cheese grin.  When my husband asked her if she liked it she just grunted and smiled as she grimed away on it.  Classy!  We also ordered the Fundido (because it is fun.)  We had never had it and it was super yummy, cheesy, sausagey... I guess I am my mother's daughter because the drool on my chin is definitely NOT a classy look.  Did I mention that I am a foodie, ... hard-core!  In fact afterward I hunted down poor Jason with the look of a stalker and pinned him in the corner until he revealed the basic idea on how to reconstruct the corn.  My family was like \"Mom!  Taste the sauce so you can make it for us at home!\"  Usually, I can pick out the nuances of just about anything.  Ironically, for as easy as the recipe Jason explained, such simple styling, such lovely ingredients, such a homily of flavors ... each lifting the other up.  Okay, I'm starting to palpitate!  I'm so glad we talked Jason.  You are my new best friend.  Regarding anyone who gives poor marks (or less that 5 stars).  Um, you either had a one off experience (every restaurant has hiccups sometimes) or you are an idiot.  This place has great food, beautiful ambiance, neat backstory, and super cool people.  Best restaurant we had been to in all of Phoenix.  I just wish there was an old church in my neighborhood that we could take over their building and make into a Taco Guild West.    Jesus would be proud of how this old building has been reinvented into another place which brings peace to mankind.",

By the time I leave, the place is packed.  It's a tequila & taco place - no wine list, fantastic drinks, over 100 different tequilas.  The site used to be an historic church & the owners preserved much of the original building.  The stained glass windows are impressive & I love the decor & ambience.  I'm longing for another visit soon.  The selection of tacos is extensive - some classic & some more edgy selections.      There are several other options as well.  I'm recommending the Taco Guild whole heartedly - have a margarita for me!  Tee hee",

The food started off amazing, their salsas are tasty and the street style corn and guac are def two thumbs up. Out of the three tacos I ordered (which were all different flavors) I only loved one. But the one was unique and really good; It was the urban bran coffee braised beef. My husband had the same experience with his set of three tacos; he only loved one; which for him was the molida lamb. The thing is we are Mexican- and having al pastor on the menu means we are judging and comparing to traditional street tacos from Mexico- which is hard to match or even come close.  This applies to the bean and rice. The drinks are also really good and unique. Overall, great place to try!!",

The parking area is used by several small businesses in this location and can be a little tight during business hours.

Lets face it, this is Phoenix, there are good tacos everywhere that were made with passion by someone who has been doing it for generations. A taco should be simple and that is what makes it, Taco Guild seemed to make it something it was not. As a gastropub only this would easily get another star as it fits that bill perfectly, but when you add taco to your name, you get held to a higher standard.  If you want a place to relax with friends go here, if you want tacos go to whatever hole in the wall you find south of downtown or on West Indian School because that is where the real tacos live.",

Situated in an old Church, they have remodeled but kept a lot of the character traits such as the stain glass windows and everyone has to sit in a pew. I am kidding about the pew.   The food was great, very authentic and fresh. We had the beef tacos and burrito along with street corn (which was phenomenal) and then we also partook in their delicious chips and salsa. My daughter loved the salsa so much she asked if we could have some to go (she is 6) and our waiter brought us a huge bag of chips and a large to go container of the salsa. Needless to say we were both very happy!  I think I am going to go there today!",

The server did not smile, didn't greet us and had an attitude. When we ordered freshly made guacamole as appetizers, it came out cold. We informed the server and he was adamant that couldn't be the case. After a few back & forths, the server got his manager and the manager got us a freshly made guacamole again just to reaffirm that something was off with the avocados.   Once we got our main entree- 8 different variety of tacos, it was again NOT meeting our expectations. First of all, the sever didn't ask if we wanted corn or flour tortilla & the lamb, duck & chicken were undercooked without any flavors to it.  I would NOT recommend this restaurant besides just stopping in to check out the ambiance and the cool \"church story\"   Do NOT fall for the trap.",

I like how they kept the stained glass.  Our service, although very nice, was bumpy.    We ordered the soup of the day which we were told was tortilla but not what we got.  No big deal as what was served was terrific.  Not sure what it was exactly but it had ground beef and fresh veg.  We then ordered our dinner, the duck tacos were delicious as were the shrimp tacos.  We also ordered a side of corn that never arrived.  We let the food runner know we were missing the side but he did not seem to really care.  He said it would be along shortly but never came.    If you get a chance, ask for the Tequila Book.  The book (menu) contains a huge list of pages of different kinds of Tequila they offer.  I did not bring my reading glasses so at first I was sure I did not read the menu correctly as I saw shots of tequila for $500... what???  I asked my dinner partner if that was five dollars and he assured me it was indeed $500.    If your bank account does not allow for five hundred dollar shots, be advised they do have a great happy hour where you can get a draft beer  and shot of Tequila for five dollars.  (pretty sure it is not the five hundred dollar shot)   They might have dessert but did not see any on the menu and we were not offered any.",

What was once filled with scrumptious morsels of perfectly cooked lamb topped with crunchy sweet potato strings and crumbly salty cheese has been replaced by a texture-less jumble of too many flavors combined with dry, stringy, braised lamb.  If you go I would, ironically, recommend the enchiladas. They've been perfect every time I've gone and you get a much bigger portion for what you pay.",

    "text": "Yes! The Taco Guild is a little bit in your pocket as far as price but let me tell you what you get!!! You are getting the most picturesque ambiance at lunch time in the middle of downtown Phoenix that you could not get anywhere else. Here, let me set it this up for you. Picture the beautiful sleepy coastal city of Ensenada with its perfect beaches and small town vibe. You wander the streets in search of what others have come to know as the best taco's this side of the California Peninsula otherwise known as \"The Cinderella of the Pacific\" and you approach what looks to be like a church. You get closer and notice a visible line outside the door adorned with the letter \"G\" and you ask yourself \"What kind of Church could this be\"? The crowd standing in front of you whispers of a gourmet taco obviously sent from the TACO GODS (probably best that this special place is located in a refurbished church) and you wonder if you have stumbled upon a real live FIND. Not just any kind of gem its the kind of gem found by the best archaeologist  kind of gem like  Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade kind of gem. A gem for the books. Once inside this remarkable edifice you are seated immediately that's right no wait time and If you remember earlier in the review I mean novel I mentioned there was a visible line in front of the door! We sit and order a frozen margarita and while we take in the breathtaking art and stain glass windows our drinks arrive. The menu isn't remarkable and not very extensive but when you know you have a good product you don't need 3-4 pages you just need one really good page. There's something to be said about a little simplicity. He ordered the famous Yukatan Shrimp Tacos , Barracho Red Beans topped with Cojita cheese (Awesome). I decided to try something different and normally my good sense would have stopped me from making the \"lets see if this taste good\" mistake but in this case with what I had already seen I WASN'T SCARED!! So I ordered the Chipotle Cherry Steak poblano straws, Chile aioli, blue chees tacos, Barracho Red Beans and the famous ELOTE corn. When they call the tacos \"New World Tacos\" that is exactly what you are stepping into a NEW WORLD... These tacos were a beautiful delight and I couldn't eat them fast enough. So much so I couldn't eat my corn because I was already full . Our waitress was awesome she had our food to us so quickly and asked along with other TACO GUILD personnel if we were satisfied or needed anything ... Of course we were fully full, happy and content. Excited to tell you, yes you that the TACO GUILD is a win. Run don't walk to the BEST STREET TACO you are ever going to get. Please excuse any grammatical errors : )",

The staff was very friendly when I picked up my order, and I was very pleasantly surprised that it came with chips (a big bag of them!) and salsa. The burrito was tasty and the steak was tender; my only suggestion would be for the kitchen to not pre-cut the burrito in half for to-go orders, as it got a little bit soggy around the cut line. (Side note: I heated up the half of the burrito I didn't finish in my toaster oven the next night and it was perfect!) The salad was good but the dressing was a bit too sweet for my taste; I may try the avocado dressing instead next time. Overall a solid meal and good value for the price - I'll definitely order from here again.",

The place was really cool, old church. Live music busy but not packed.  The food presentation was beautiful, it looked great but just fell flat at every turn.   Chips and salsa, decent nothing great. We ordered the guacamole and queso dip duo, the dip was decent the guacamole was f.l.a.t. We have never not finished guac before last night :( We both ordered the tacos trio with the street corn. Our food arrived looking amazing! Sadly it was cold and again very flat.  Just not worth the hype. We may go again but probably not.  I think there are plenty of other great Mexican places that may not be as cool but the food service and price are better.",

The whole Taco Church concept was super cool, so were the beautiful stained glass windows. The patio was quaint and cute. But if we're being honest, I wasn't there to admire the structual beauty. Let's get down to brass tacks here. So, I got the 3-taco plate. The 2 shrimp tacos I got had so few  pieces of shrimp in each taco, accompanied by a ton of saucy cabbage. The al pastor taco I got was ok, but it was insanely spicy (and I actually love heat). Oh and the salad I got as a side to my meal was awful. It had Mexican style beans in it but it had this weird vinegarette which didn't compliment the beans at all. It just made it into a weird vinegarette-bean paste, which made the lettuce very soggy. Over all experience was meh. I had such high hopes after all the things I heard too.",

Food came out cold.  Repeated requests for silverware.  On and on....In the end we paid $140 for the entire experience.  I can see how the taco's would be great if they weren't cold.  Not warm, cold....In the end.  I will not return.  No way.  For the four us to pay that, granted alcohol was involved, for the level of service you would get from a stoned Chili's waitress.  Not trying to do that to myself or anyone I know.  IF, the taco's were hot and the service impeccable, I would be telling a different story.  But they weren't, so I'm not.  Don't do this to yourself.  Go somewhere else and feel like they want your business.",

    "text": "Let's start with the fact that I gave Taco Guild 3 stars because it's really gorgeous inside.  Great ambiance.  I would bet it's super sexy at night when the lights are low.  Amazing reuse of an existing church! If it weren't so pretty, I would have given it 2 stars.    One of the remaining two stars can be attributed to their GREAT happy hour prices.  $5 for a killer margarita that certainly was NOT stingy on the tequila, is worthy of it's own star.  Without the yummy margarita at $5, I would have given it 1 star.  It was NOT WORTH $60 FOR LUNCH.    For a place that uses the word \"Taco\" right in its name, the tacos better be top notch, mouth-watering, dreamy.  Two out of the 6 we tried fit that description.  One was the Pork Adovada.  It was delicious.  The other was the special taco of the day, chicken with mexican cheese and some delicious sauce. Hopefully they put it on the  permanent menu!  It's far better than the dried up, tasteless options we unfortunately chose at the suggestion of our server (who was very nice btw).  So disappointing.   We also had the ceviche of the day, which happened to be Ahi tuna.  Although, had they not told us it was Ahi, we never would have known it.  The dish was $10 and there were maybe 4 minuscule pieces of fish in it. And the chips they served with it completely overpowered the ceviche.  To the point that we used the tortilla chips they gave us when we sat down (paired with 4 different kinds of salsa...each one more bland than the other, with the exception of one, that tasted like sriracha poured directly into a ramekin...which isn't bad.. not just very authentic).    Sadly, the street corn was soggy and bland. It was the first time in our entire lives we've left street corn uneaten.  Normally we battle for the last kernels, licking our lips along the way.  Theirs simply wasn't worth eating. Better to save the calories for something good.  Like their margaritas.   So the net net.  Go after 10pm for their late night happy hour. Sit in the gorgeous candlelit room, sipping on fabulous margaritas for $5, order yourself a couple of the tacos of the day for $1.99 each (that way if they aren't that good, you won't mind so much), and you'll get to experience Taco Guild in a great way.  Otherwise, I fear you may leave like we did.  $60 poorer, hungry, and feeling like we just got rolled.",

    "text": "So first off, I have to say that what they have done with the church is amazing and renewing older Phoenix structures is exactly what Phoenix needs more of. Also, the inside decor is amazingly beautiful and it is obvious that it was thoughtfully chosen. The one thing I have to say about the ambiance is that the music was WAY too loud. I could barely have a conversation with anyone at my table. I would like a restaurant ambiance and not one that I would find at a Scottsdale club.     Despite the awesome decor, I had many issues with the food. First of all I thought the guacamole was WAY over priced for the small little dish that we received. I honestly felt totally robbed for a guacamole dish that wasn't particularly special. Second, I thought the tacos were also way over-priced for what we got; $4 or $5 a taco left me again feeling totally robbed. Our waitress did let us know that if you order three tacos then you get a free side, which we all took advantage of. However, these sides are quite small and if ordered on their own are $2.50. Definitely not worth the price. Overall, the taste of the tacos was very good so they did get that aspect right.    Finally, we went during the opening week so I won't be entirely harsh on the service, but what service we did receive was very poor. Once we were seated we waited 20 minutes for a waitress to come to the table and she wasn't even our actual waitress. She kindly took our orders, but we still had to wait ten more minutes for our waitress to come by the table and fill our waters. Thankfully, she took an item off our bill to show us that she was sorry. I'm sure the service will get better with time, but if prices stay where they are then I'm not sure I will return.",

    "text": "Can someone in Chicago please copy this idea? I went here with my husband and some of his co-workers, so I avoided being that person who takes pictures of their meal, but this place was outstanding!! Such a unique ambiance, and I love the way the church is still incorporated into the decor and menu (stained glass windows, biblical paintings above, and drink names - i.e. the serpent). The guac is topped with perfectly crispy bacon, and multiple people at our table raved about how ridiculously good the queso is! The majority of us went for a variety of tacos and just raved about them. They also have a great variety of FROZEN MARGS with flavors beyond regular and strawberry. This place is a MUST DO if you're looking for good, affordable Mexican food. This is also spacious enough for groups and has a cool factor if you're looking for something unique to the area. Loved everything about it and would definitely go back next time we're in Phoenix!",

    "text": "High ratings pulled me in this place..... Bad decision. Waitress was snotty, if there were specials, we never heard about them.  When I ordered my taco, I asked if I could have a small side of guacamole, not an unreasonable request at a Mexican restaurant?  Apparently so!  I was told it was only sold as an appetizer.  I said that I wanted really wanted to try it, but couldn't eat an appetizer sized order. The waitress, with the GIANT hoop earrings, shrugged her shoulders, \"too bad\" plus attitude.   So no side of guacamole for me! I ordered the URBAN BEAN COFFEEE BRAISED BEEF with caramelized onion, mango jicama relish, and Cotija cheese.  With all those ingredients, you would think that it would have some flavor?  Very under seasoned.  Although there WAS an overwhelming part to this Taco, it wasn't greasy.....it was oily.  Everyone loves a greasy taco now and then, but oily?  Yuck...  The Mexican Street Corn was a disaster!  This is the description right from their website: STREET CORN - grilled corn on the cob, habanero butter, chipotle mayonnaise, cotija cheese. Ok see in the description where it says \"grilled corn on the cob\"?  Well there was NOTHING grilled about it, just a soggy, and I mean SOGGY, piece of corn!  I have included a photo.  Just look at the husk, when I picked it up, so much liquid streamed out of it that it went right through my napkin on my lap and soaked my jeans.  No grill marks, no charred grilled corn taste, just soggy BOILED corn with mayo,  I couldn't identify any habanero butter taste all.  I hope I can get the spot out of my jeans,  I don't need that as a reminder of my dismal food experience at Taco Guild!",

Also, they immediately welcome you with chips and four different salsas (I'm a huge salsa critic and I loved every single one of theirs!). I had the pork adovada taco and the chipotle cherry steak taco. Both were so amazing, despite their lack of spice!  I originally asked for the spiciest taco and the waiter said that there wasn't much spice here, but said that she could substitute in a habenero butter into my tacos. LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. The butter wasn't spicy, but it was so delicious and I really appreciated the waitress' willingness to accommodate me. Can I please live here?  You HAVE to come here! Bring a friend, bring two.. honestly, just bring everyone!  So this is what love at first sight feels like.",

The energetic vibe and physical restaurant atmosphere (the restaurant was formerly a church) makes a great place for carrying out good conversations. Food is good, though I believe that the price point is a smidgen higher than it should be (tacos are on the smaller side and costs an average $3.50 each).  While it's really difficult to have spectacular Mexican food in Arizona, these guys have done a really good job making creative dishes here.  Lastly, their hottest salsa is actually spicy-- we love it!",

The outside seating was not available and misters were not on. We sat in the old church foyer and the floor was disgustingly covered in food and we were constantly swatting flys. So bad we asked to move and explained why. After we moved they sat a couple there who didn't last long and left. Another couple were sat there right away! Unbelievable.  There were 4 of us. Waiter seemed uninterested and stated he was in no hurry. One dish came out 10 minutes before the rest. Tacos were not hot but sorta warm. On a side note, when we were walking there across the parking lot a complete stranger stopped their car, rolled down the window and said it was terrible and don't waste our money! I just may have to stop bragging about this place. Totally let down.",

When my husband and I arrived we were seated immediately. It was happy hour so we were a little surprised. Our waiter was amazing- very attentive and friendly.  Chips were good but the salsa was too hot- something I never complain about but whatever, I kept eating anyway.  I ordered the beef enchiladas. Wow, bland bland bland. The red sauce was unedible, in fact, I scrapped it off and was surprised to find that the beef was unflavorful. The red beans on the side were ok but questionable. The only good thing about the plate was the side of rice.  My husband had the tacos. He had the shrimp, coffee braised beef and the chicken tacos with the side of red beans. He didn't seem to complain about his plate as much as he did the beans. He did make a comment about the smell of the beans but I'll save you the graphic detail.  I did enjoy 2 of the happy hour margaritas but mostly because I wanted the taste out of my mouth. Can't say I'll be running back to the guild anytime soon.",

We also ordered the fundido which fell a little short.  The sausage didn't have much flavor to it, but the menonita cheese was perfectly melted.    Dinner:  One ordered the chicken enchilada which was good, not great.  Another ordered the steak burrito which was the clear winner of the night.  Cooked right, good mix of fillings, wrap was good, overall, best thing of the night.  Then I ordered tacos.  The al pastor pork, guild chicken, and lamb.  The lamb and pork was not edible, they were bad, like, i'll eat and finish tacos if they're just okay, I took one bite and left them, didn't want to touch or even give it a second bite.  The guild chicken one was absolutely delicious, but it unfortunately did not make up for the other two terrible tacos.  Would I go back?  Probably.  I'd just stay away from certain things like those two tacos, the fundido.",

I would recommend for going with a group so people can order as much food as they want and it helps balance the desires of those that want to eat a lot with those that want a snack.

    "text": "So let me start by saying that i have eaten tacos and drank margaritas all over the valley from street tacos to 24 hour corner stops and grandiose restaurants alike and Taco Guild fell anything but short of what id hoped it to be. Its housed in an 1800's church with original structure intact if that tells you anything. When i entered its doors i expected to disappointed but when i caught glimpse of what was hiding inside i felt as if a symphony should have been playing as i gazed across the beautifully inlaid church \"of tacos\". I was greeted immediately (it was one of their slower times) and given the choice to sit wherever i liked(i choose the very back center of the building so i could take in the surroundings as i enjoyed my food). I want to say my server was ?Jessica?, but on to the food. It was happy hour so i ordered their house margarita which was far from well(a sauza base). I always say if you really want to test the taste of someone's food start simple. Upon receiving my margarita i was served a flight of salsa along with chips made in house. There were 4 salsas ranging from a Habenero to jalapeno and a simple but sweet house salsa all of which were made In house as well. Let me tell you for the next 15 minutes i let the flavors of these salsas roll over my tongue from sweet to sour, from pugnet to a tingling burn they touched every part of my palette. What a flight! I was not starving but wanted to soak some of the sauza up before i made my way home, so i ordered the pork taco. The taco was every bit as delicious as the menu description led it to be enticing. I spoke to Jason the manager and was compelled after my experience to complement him on the excellent job his staff and him were doing. I will definitely be coming back when i make my way back around.",

No better way to start off with hot tortilla chips with the fresh guacamole, made to order!  (I dont even like onions, and I ate it, cuz it's so good) I've tried different tacos, but the one that stands out to me is the Pork Adovada Taco made with mango, jicama relish, cilantro and fresh advocado slices.  The marination used for the pork adovada is the best I've ever tasted!!  Let's just say.....This taco is very pleasing & tantalizing to my pallet!! The Guild Chicken tacos and Tropical Ono were also my favorite, and the Street Corn is                     A-Mazing, with their Chipotle mayo & cotija cheese!!  No other street corn like this!!  Now, I want to take the time to brag about one of the superivisor's named Jason,  He made our whole visit there even more special, by accommodating our needs in such a friendly manner. And having a table ready for me and my guests, checking in on us a couple of times to see if we needed anything. That is how managers/supervisors should be at every restaurant.  Even though they were crazy busy, Jason still stopped at our table.  Which is now the main reason I brag about the Taco Guild!!  Jason You Rock!!!   \\\\m//",

The tacos were good, not great, but good. My wife and I had the lamb, cherry steak, braised beef, and the duck. Each of the tacos seemed to be a little dry though. My favorite was the lamb with the blue cheese. I'm not usually a fan of corn tortillas but they make them in house (I think) and they were pretty bombski.

We got really nice table and the best sever ever. Yes, his name is Eric.  Eric was exceptional. The best sever I came a cross in a long time.   Food was amazing, from appetizers to entrees, to drinks...etc.  Everybody was so happy with the choice. Grandparents enjoyed the ambiance and loved how the church was transformed and made into this nice restaurant.    Eric made sure we were taking care of at all times. No question we are going back, but calling ahead and making sure Eric is working if we have a bigger party again.   Thank you Eric! You are amazing!",

My experience at Taco Guild is always amazing! I love the food and highly recommend the chipotle cherry steak tacos and the Mexican street corn. They are both off the charts! As other people have said in reviews, I love how the restaurant is built inside an old church. It gives the restaurant a different vibe than almost any other place to eat in Phoenix. The service is also top notch as well! Jason has always been very courteous and attentive to my needs and makes the whole night out a great experience. If you have time ask him for a tour of the building! I love going to a place that treats you like family and each visit to Taco Guild leaves me feeling extremely satisfied!",
