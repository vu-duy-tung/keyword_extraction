They were still warm from being made and the bagel itself was a big portion. Everyone in the office was in awe with these bagels. There were two types of cream cheese: Veggie and lox. I had never tried lox before today and am now in love. It does not have a super strong smoked taste which is good. The veggie is also delicious and actually has veggie chunks including carrots and cucumbers. The egg bagel was fabulous. I can't wait to go to the location and check out more menu items.",

I will never be able to have a store bought bagel again thanks to the bagel man.   On another note the fresh made cream cheese is the perfect accompaniment.

The best I'd found in PHX since moving here in 2012 was Scott's Generations on 7th St. They were decent bagels, but not memorable. Just bought my first dozen at Bagel Man. Excellent, excellent. As good as my favorite place back east. They were still warm, as they should be. The scallion cream cheese I bought was also wonderful. So glad to have found this place.

My husband and the owner chat about New York every time he goes in there, reminding us that there's more to life than grab your food and go - this is a neighborhood joint and repeat visitors are remembered and appreciated.  Although we typically go there for bagels and bialys (they run out QUICK!), the sandwiches are killer as well, particularly the Reuben.  The place is pretty small and in a nondescript shopping center on Elliott, so you'll probably want to grab your food and go.  Perfect for mornings when you want breakfast in a hurry and fast food joints aren't on the menu.",

I walked in and nervously asked the lady, should've gotten her name, if they served lunch. She smiled at me and said, \"I can do anything.\" I got so happy and ordered \"The Sexy\" but with no herb mayo because I can't stand mayo, AT ALL. So she asked, \"Would you like to substitute the herb CREAM CHEESE instead?\" I got even more happy and asked, \"You can do that?\" She smiled and repeated herself, \"I can do anything.\" Needless to say, I was super happy about it and let me just say, that SANDWICH was f*cking phenomenal.

Top cream cheese spread would have to be the scallion but the Lox comes in a close second for me. As for bagels, the salt bagel is the best I have ever had.   The prices are great and it's a great pick me up early in the morning. I'm already looking forward to tomorrow morning just so I can have a bagel.",

Well, the Bagel man came up and ... because we don't have many great bagel places in Hawaii, we jumped at the chance! After riding our luxurious bus to the strip mall, we see \"The Bagel Man\" right in front of us! It's PACKED!!!!!!!!!  A GOOD SIGN! We go in and stand in line chatting excitedly and this guy bumps into me and says \"sorry\" - it's the THE Bagelman!!!!! I told everyone \"hey the Bagel man bumped into me\"!!!!!! OK, not many bagels left - because it's close to 12 and they close at 12. Still, several options to choose from. How did it taste? Well, it was great! Different from some other bagels I usually eat on the mainland - a little lighter with a good bite. Perhaps not as chewy, but still great! Someone else ordered a walnut bagel and it was incredible. I had the breakfast bagel and it was very good - excellent. The coffee was standard diner fare but got the job done.  The workers are FUNNY! I can't repeat what they said, but hang around and you hear funny stuff over and over!  Next time I go back, the Bagel Man will be on my list again!!!!!!",

He said the only way to tell if a bagel is good is to get the bagel of your choice with plain cream cheese.  He picked everything and since I don't much care for bread I ordered nothing.  While he waited for his bagel he asked for water the owner told him take any cup and help yourself to ice Tewa if you like.  Excellent business practice!  The bagel arrived and looked perfect, nicely toasted with a healthy helping of smear.  I took my fourth of his bagel and enjoyed every bite.  As we sat in the parking lot we decided what the heck it's practically lunch, and headed right back in for a bagel sandwich.  As we were trying to decide what to order the clerk said there was no reason to split the sandwich his half meat my half veggie because he would give me a free sandwich!  So I had the everything bagel all veggies and fresh mozzarella cheese....delish!!  He has a grilled chicken with roasted peppers, bacon and herb aoli.  Also a total win!  Now, I don't like to eat bread because it leaves me feeling sluggish but not these bagels.  I felt great and full of energy all day.  Now do I expect a free bagel every time? Nope.  But the Bagel Man has 2 new customers.  4 stars for yummy chewy, crispy outside, flavorful bagels and the extra star for over-the-top exceptional customer service.  Making plans to go back tomorrow......yum!",

Not good when you are anticipating your meal. On one occasion, Owner was out of change and actually told me he would \"Catch me Next Time:. Really?  If anything, he should have offered to undercharge me by the difference, and not the opposite. Also, if you need a receipt be ready to give out your email address, cause that is the ONLY way to get one. Not even sure this is Legal! Should be given the option of a hard copy at time of service, OR, emailed at your choice. Bagels may be good at times, but, too many other important things are off putting.",

I agree that it can be a little awkward, but I've always gotten what I wanted and been served well.

We made a point to stop at this place both times instead of taking the Phoenix Bypass that would save us time on our trip. The food is THAT good here. I love their cheese bagel with the scallion cream cheese spread. My husband has gotten two different bagel sandwiches. Both were delicious. The service is really great here too. The owner is a really friendly dude that seems to genuinely care about his customers. I am really sad that we don't live closer to this place, but you best believe we will stop by on any future road trips.

The bagels were so soft and moist and flavorful and on top of that the customer service was excellent. The cook gave us a mini tour in the back where they boil the bagels in house fresh before baking them!   I ordered an everything bagel with cream cheese and a small coffee and my boyfriend got a cheese bagel with butter. Both of us ate for under 7 bucks and we left with full happy tummys :)",

But I don't eat them very often because most bagels in the Phoenix area are so mediocre it's just not worth it.  Bagel Man bagels are incredible.  We went there on Saturday to pick up a dozen and the everything bagels had just come out of the oven.  OMG.  Fresh, piping hot, soft, flavorful - PERFECT.  And the veggie cream cheese is also amazing.  I wish we lived closer but then I might eat 5 bagels a day.  Maybe it's good we're a few miles away.    Can't wait to go back.  Oh and I love The Bagel Man himself - he's legit.",

    "text": "Fantastic bagels!  I want to give this place 5 stars, based on the bagels, but my experience there was a little off, so I'm reserving it at 4 for now.  I had a strong craving for a bagel sandwich one day at work, so I decided to check out this place. I walked in and wasn't overly impressed with the place. It's a little run down and not the cleanest place. It's a small place, with only a couple of tables (but there aren't many people sitting down to eat here, I suppose). I came around 12:30 or 1:00 in the afternoon, and I immediately noticed there were not many bagels left in the racks. The group before me got the last of a couple different varieties of bagels, so I was pretty limited with my options.  I was thinking breakfast bagel sandwich, but I ended up going with one of the lunch sandwiches instead. Cinnamon raisin was the best of the remaining options, in my opinion, so I went with it. It was perhaps an odd combination with the red peppers and turkey on my sandwich, but oh well. When I got my sandwich, the bagel had been perfectly toasted. The texture was great! A little crunch on the outside, and nice and tender on the inside. This bagel truly was great. The sandwich toppings were decent, but as it should be at a bagel shop, the bagel was by far the star of the show. I'm definitely going to come back for more, and I may just do that cinnamon raisin bagel again for a sandwich, because it really was good.  I definitely will be back for a breakfast sandwich. There is little better for breakfast than a nice bagel sandwich. And with these bagels, I can only imagine...  The service was friendly, but spotty. When I ordered from the cashier, he kept gazing off in different directions and seemingly forgetting what he was doing. He definitely seemed distracted. I had to remind another of the guys of what I had ordered a couple of times. But in the end, I got what I ordered, and it was great.  Had I had more bagel options and the service been better, this place is a 5. I'll give it another chance in the future.  Thanks, Bagel Man!",

Some of the popular spots in Phoenix -- e.g. Chompie's -- don't make real bagels. They're just \"rolls with holes\", just common bread. A bagel is distinctive in its chewy texture and unique flavor.  For reference, Einsteins and Back East Bagels will give you real bagels, far better than Chompie's. Bagel Man is better still. They don't just make real bagels -- they make good bagels. Best I've had anywhere in the Tempe, Ahwatukee, Mesa, Chandler area.",

    "text": "First let me tell you my theory about NY bagels.  I left NYC in 1958 so my recall is of that era.  The last True bagel bakers were unable to interest their grandchildren to become bakers and the \"art\" slowly morphed from the '40s - '50s style to the 21st century, baked by non-Jewish bakers of other origins. Yes they still boiled and then baked but were different.  Not not good or great but a new style for a new people.  We love things based on good memories and the current younger population likes their newer style of bagel, hence the great reviews that I can't agree with as I am (a long retired New Yorker longing for the bagels of yore:)  To me a bagel always has a distinct hole in it's center, a shiny, tough, and lightly crunchy rich brown crust and a chewy dense interior.  I thought that Bruegger's Bagels came close.  They are gone from our area but still in Tucson. Bagelman's bagels taste good, they are however not what I expected and hence not a NY bagel to ME! Their Bialy however is too dense, as their bagel is not dense enough.   To all the young folk out there (born less than 50 years ago), you will love Bagelman's baking!!! Mr. Bagelman, keep it up, you are indeed pleasing those you need to please!",

So I was stoked when I saw the good reviews about this place.    I ordered cinnamon raisin bagel with veggie cream cheese ( don't knock it till you try it). I was pleasantly surprised, the cinnamon raisin had lots of flavor and the veggie cream cheese had crisp veggie chunks in it which it great!!   I ordered 6 bagels to go of other flavors and those didn't  disappoint and they held up in softness and weren't rock hard the next day , always a plus!

Most of the varieties are the usual suspects, but their cheese bagel has a wonderful surprise in the center as the cheese melts into the hole, and caramelizes on the bottom, it is the real treasure. They also have in house made specialty cream cheeses and a variety of sandwiches. On weekends the line can be long and slowish but it is worth the wait.",

Being from the East coast, ever since moving to AZ the bagels and bread and pizza crusts don't taste the same. I know it's got to do with the water somehow but let's just say THANK YOU BAGEL MAN! I do not live close by, but I will be coming back for sure. I tried their sesame bagel, pumpernickel, cinnamon raisin bagel,YES I took a few home and they were all delicious! Exactly the REAL bagel I've been looking for. Also, the veggie cream cheese was so good, I regret not buying more of it because it didn't last in my house. Highly recommend the bagel man for anyone who loves a good bagel. PS, the next day my bagels were still great and delicious. Many places the bagels are ok the first day and the next day hard as a rock, but not these. Perfect once lightly toasted :)",

I was born on the east coast and my family lives there, so I'm very particular about foods like bagels, pizza, soft pretzels, and seafood. Not just any will do! This east coast girl (at heart) approves. I got a traditional bagel and lox and it was so good! And HUGE! I had to take half home.  And the customer service is great as well. I was greeted promptly and warmly. They made me feel as if I had been coming in for years. They also seemed to know all their customers that came in. I love to see that.   My only negative comment is that it was so hot in there!  I will definitely be back!",

The owner is a pleasure and genuinely loves providing his customers with delicious offerings.

As others have said, these bagels are superb and the service is stellar.  The prices are very reasonable and the food is fresh.  No fru-fru coffee drinks here (just the basic cup, which is fine with me), the focus is on the bagels, and that is obvious.    Small little place and it can get busy, but it seems to go fast.  Get in line, order your food, maybe grab some coffee while you wait.  Pay when it is ready and either sit at one of the few tables inside or sit outside to enjoy the nice AZ weather.  Breakfast sandwiches, fresh made flavored cream cheese (I asked for jalapeno cream cheese and he made some for me on the spot, cream cheese + jalapenos), Boar's Head meat for the lunch sandwiches, and some home baked pastries (from someone else's home).    With all of the good stuff on the menu, my absolute favorite is the lox and cream cheese on an everything bagel with all the fixin's (tomato, onion, capers). YUM!  I could go on, but my breakfast has arrived and it is time to eat!  Enjoy!",

Now, let me say that Bagel Man carries by far the best bagel I have ever tasted outside of New York State. The owner has a location back east as well, so it is no surprise that he knows what he's doing. You can try anywhere else you want in the Phoenix metro region, but you will never find a bagel that comes even close to the flavor and taste of these authentic bagels. Every single one of my family and friends that have come to visit me agree. In addition, anytime I introduce these bagels to any of my local friends they are blown away and from then on will not buy a bagel anywhere else.   Plain and simple, Bagel Man has the absolute best bagels you will have outside of New York and I have even found in many occasions that his bagels are better than some of the places back east.",

Not a little under-baked, but squeeze-the-bread-just-little-and-it-turns-back-into-dough, under-baked. I can't give any higher than 3 stars for that baking faux pas. I get that they are turning out bagels quickly, but they needed to give them another good 10-12 minutes in the oven, minimum. Make the customers wait for quality.   The flavor, however, was excellent. The salt bagel had the perfect amount of salt without making me feel like a blowfish, and the jalapeno bagel was jam-packed full of jalapeno flavor. You can also tell they use the boiling technique which makes them a chewy texture. If only they had been baked well!   I did not get a sandwich, or even cream cheese, since I wanted to see if these are truly NY-style. They are...except for that one thing I mentioned 120 times.   Maybe a bad day for the Bagel Man. I probably won't be back to find out.",

    "text": "This is my go to place when I have time to breakfast in the mornings.  I think the word \"authentic\" is thrown around way too often in Yelp reviews and I am guilty of using too often too . . . so please forgive me for using one more time; The Bagel Man has authentic NYC bagels and frankly, if they weren't they are still amazing.  Meal:  Just pick anything off of the menu.  Don't think . . .just choose.  It will be well worth it.  I recommend that you don't taste the bagel because it ruins the taste, but that is just my preference.   Taste:  These bagels are the cat's pajamas.  While the sandwiches are terrific, I recommend keeping it simple and just stick with the bagels.  10 out of 10.  Value: You can maybe go somewhere else and find cheaper bagels, but they are exactly just that, cheaper bagels.  The quality of these bagels could demand almost any price but they are reasonably priced. 4 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:  The Bagel Man has to be the nicest man in the food business in the East Valley.  He always greets you with a smile.  He loves to interact with the customers . . .but his supporting staff lately has dropped the ball.  The last time I was there, one of his employees begun to take my order and walked away mid-way.  She went to the back and after waiting for a few minutes, I just left. 6 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  It was it is - its a bagel place and I don't thing there really needs to be anything else, right?  3 out of 5.  Overall:  I feel there service has really gone down lately.  If every employee there was just like he Bagel Man himself, this place would be an easy 5 star place!  23 out of 30 points, 3 out of 5 stars.",

I'm from Ohio and miss the great Jewish NY-style deli's I had all around me, because there is a serious lack of them in Arizona. However, Bagel Man has the best bagels in the valley. They have great varieties and are incredibly delicious and last for longer than most you would get at Chompie's or some other fake deli. The owner was awesome, he introduced himself and was doing everything well. They serve Boar's Head meat which is the best if you ask me and they have some variety for being a small place.

The Bagel Man himself has been behind the counter on both of my visits, and he's super friendly. He bakes and boils the bagels himself and the quality shows. On my first visit a few months ago, I ordered the Sexy sandwich on a pumpernickel bagel (my favorite!), which if I recall, was a sandwich wiith turkey, havarti and roasted red peppers among other things. I got a combo which included a drink and a side, I chose the plain Wise potato chips. It was all tasty and fresh. On my second visit, I just went with a toasted pumpernickel with cream cheese and an untoasted everything bagel to go. I also noticed the big black and white cookies in the pastry case, so I had to throw one of those in as well. The bagels were top notch as usual, and the black and white cookie was good too. I'd never had one before but immediately thought of Seinfeld when I saw it. These cookies are more akin to half of a whoopie pie (very cake-like) iced in simple vanilla and chocolate frostings. I didn't ask if they were made in-house, but they may be. My one and only gripe about the place is the ambiance. It's in a strip mall so my expectations weren't that high but it would go a long way in increasing the inviting nature of the place if they had some music playing. All in all, if you're looking for authentic, chewy bagels, look no further than the Bagel Man!",

They are by far much larger than other bagels from anywhere else, like Einstein Bagels. I usually need to eat 3 or 4 of Einstein Bagels to get full (and I'm a little 5'4 120lb girl), and just 1 or 2 of the Bagel Man's bagels are more than enough to fill me up. The owner is so sweet and remembers you after you show up once. He always asks how I've been and remembers details from last time, he is so friendly. The second you walk in the door he will greet you. As for what was said by that negative review below, that isn't True at all. The place is clean and smells wonderfully of freshly baked bagels. There are other workers who have rang me up before, and were very friendly with it. The only thing I could find negative at all about this place was that its slightly warm inside, but that's just because they are baking bagels all day! Every time I am in Phoenix I stop by and get some of their bagels! They are great to eat after a morning workout. Sometimes when I stop by at the end of the day, I get a couple free bagels with my order. I would definitely recommend stopping by, and trying the egg bagel especially!",

I'm not sure.  I decided to keep it simple and ordered a toasted cinnamon raisin bagel with the honey, walnut and raisin cream cheese.  It was good but to me the bagel didn't' taste any better than a grocery store bakery.

Not only does this place pack in the cream cheese, but they also bring delicious flavor with great value!  You can't go wrong with anything that you get here, I am partial to the garlic bagels- hope you have some extra gum or mints laying around because they don't play games when it comes to bringing the garlic flavor! Averaging about $3/bagel by the time you add your cream cheese, the pricing is very reasonable.   If you go early enough, you can meet the owner! He's a friendly man, and you can tell he's passionate about what he does.   The only negative to this place is outside of the outdoor seating, it's not really a 'sit down and enjoy your meal' kind of place. I would describe it more as a grab and go. The interior is small, but I'd much rather go to a small tasty shop than stand in line for a restaurant chain where the bagels are so-so.",

Some of the newer guys working there are...new....let's say. Go early and often!",

Yelped some nearby breakfast locations and this seemed to have great reviews. I'm not from New York, but I do have decent bagel standards. My so, who IS from New York, was with me, and he has high bagel standards.   The place still had customers hanging around even though it was only an hour until they supposedly close at noon. We were greeted by two people, one of which  guessing was the owner (by other review descriptions). Our orders were taken immediately and rung up. The owner was cheerful and jokingly said that 'I would never go to Starbucks again after I tasted their coffee'. I'm not hard to please and ordered a breakfast sandwich with bacon on a sesame bagel, and a small coffee. My so ordered the same thing on a cinnamon raisin bagel.   Bagels were tasty! And the eggs looked real. Not that liquid egg stuff. The coffee was yummy and I was happy! My so said that this looked like a typical bagel joint back in NY, with baskets of bagels, a small crew and quick service. I would definitely come here again after workouts for a quick breakfast stop. Bagels are way better here than from any major chain. It looks like they also have lunch sandwiches and a few other things to try.",

You are better off going to Fry's or Safeway and picking up a french baguette and slapping some cream cheese on it. Much cheaper that way and hey, probably tastes better too.",

The guy recommended not to toast the bagel since they were already freshly made and hot out of the oven! Really glad he did because it made the sandwich that much better.  I didn't give the place five stars because it was so small and got really busy. There isn't really any place to wait for your to go order. It took awhile for my sandwiches and then when I said the order was mine the guys tried giving it to someone else. Maybe they can take down names when calling out the orders instead or give out numbers.",

The first time I stopped in, I paid for my meal and he looked at me and said \"you'll be back\"... he was right, but I didn't think it would be the next morning!    It's nice when small businesses like this GET IT - and are able to consistently crank out a quality product within their niche.  Clearly his recipes are spot on, for the bagels and the schmear which are made fresh daily.

I don't see how people waste their money at Einsteins bagel. Man I would die for a bagel right now with some coffee, reminds me of when I was in New York City.",

But I have to say I was pleasantly surprised while in Phoenix last week to have a delish NY style bagel shop across the street from my hotel.  The Bagel Man makes a good bagel. And even better tuna salad and I am a tuna lover.  Better than my Jewish mom's tuna salad!  It even came with a pickle and some pretty decent potato salad. They even have some deli sandwiches. All at reasonable prices. How good is this place?  They close at 2pm and by 1:30 when we got there they only had 3 bagels left. Not 3 flavors, 3 bagels.  Got my pumpernickel, hubby got the last poppy. Now I have to fly back to Phoenix for the tuna on an everything bagel and get there before closing.",

    "text": "Another Yelp breakfast search success! Bagel Man whips up one delicious breakfast sandwich that hollers New York authenticity. The eggs, meat, and cheese bust out from the fresh and spongy bagels. There's a reason they're called Bagel Man and not Bagel Boy - this is a grown up establishment.  I came through on a Saturday morning. Craving eggs and coffee, I had searched Yelp while driving through the area. The outstanding reviews convinced me so I pulled on over. The restaurant can be a little cramped with the counter taking up most of the space. My eyes darted around the large menu behind it, covered in tasty bagel options. They've got quite the spread, and I don't mean what goes on your bagel! The smear options go for days.   I ordered the scrambled eggs with sausage and cheese on a wheat bagel. It came out wrapped up in foil to go. The bagels are soo good. They consistency isn't bready, it's more pliable and buttery. The trick is in the boiling and baking. Very scientific.   The store is a little warm, but the real heat is coming from their kitchen. Check out this gem of a bagel shop off the I-10/Elliot.",

I have no idea why you would go to any other bagel place in a 5 mile radius, well except on Mondays when they are closed.  My suggestion is a Bacon, Egg, and Cheese on a Cinnamon Raisin, it will change your life.  The Boy loves their Scrambled Eggs with Lox sandwich which is an amazing deal.  His sandwich is always loaded up and feels like it weights pounds.  The Boy and I always say we wish we would try their lunch sandwiches but I love their bagels by themselves so I stick with that.  They have had a minor change in prices so the older photos of the menu are out of date but don't let that stop you from visiting.  All the Points to Bagel Man!",

Their bagels have great texture from a slightly crispy exterior to a chewy and delicious center. I would highly recommend checking this spot out especially if you are a bagel-lover like myself.

Apparently,  they can close earlier if they sell out. When we arrived, there was already a line out the door. It was a tiny little cafe. A lot of people were ordering their food to go. We stood in line for about 25 min before we could order. When we got up to order, half of their bagels were already sold out. The plain bagels were even gone. We ordered 5 bagels and 1 bagel sandwich. My husband ordered The Sexy sandwich. It had Turkey and roasted peppers in it. He said it was ok. The Turkey tasted fresh, but the sesame bagel had an overpowering taste though. They were all out of plain bagels. The other bagels were humongous. They were quite chewy and flavorful. The Raisin Walnut Cream cheese was delicious.  They had many topping options for bagels, such as various cream cheese and jelly.  So just make sure that you get there early to get first choice on foods.  The bathrooms were clean and well kept.",

This is one of the handful of places in Phoenix that I've tried to find a decent bagel at and is by far the worst.  I got somewhat excited when I read all the reviews saying this place is the best they've had outside of NY or that the owner apparently has a bagel shop back east. But, I've come to the realization that whenever someone says that on Yelp they're either lying or they must of been going to some horrible places back east to begin with.  The bagels look more like Kaiser rolls than bagels... Where is the hole in the middle? The texture is more like toasted bread rather than the soft chewy texture that a proper bagel should have.   Also, I don't know if this place makes its own cream cheese. But I got the plain cream cheese and it was completely sour. Not something you want to be eating.   So far the most 'authentic' bagel I've found is the Lenders frozen ones you can find at grocery stores.",

Putting a few additional tables outside certainly would not hurt this business.  There are plenty of options on the menu and you can see that they are making the bagels fresh in the back. There's also a good selection of deli meats displayed at the front counter. I would say this is a great place to pick up a dozen bagels for the office.

Yesterday was definitely my last time there, this place has gone way downhill. There's never any management there, so the staff is always just screwing around, joking and laughing. Then they get my order wrong every damn time. I literally order the same thing every time I go in there, and the girl even tells me my order before I say it... then they make it wrong, and it's not even on a bagel. Yesterday when I was waiting for my order, someone else came back cause his was wrong too. Wtf! Seriously done, I don't have time for that crap.",

And just a warning, if you go there near closing (like I did) they may run out of certain bagels. Was sad I didn't get to try their Everything bagel, but will definitely be back another time!",

The real issue with this place is they seem to run out blueberry and cinnamon raisin. They always have bins full of onion bagels... but they  Can't seem to figure that out. I like blueberry bagels but I have struck out three times recently so I have to cross this shop off my list. Very sad, because the bagels are good but if they can't make them I can't waste my time trying to catch them with one on han.   Like an idiot I tried again today to get a blueberry bagel and they were out. Again. Waited 15 minutes to be told they were out. I'm done. These guys are just inept. Terrible way to run a business.

    "text": "In general, I make it a habit to visit any restaurant that has a line out the door.  In fact, the longer the line the better.  Which is just what happened one sunny Saturday recently in Phoenix, when I was visiting a bucket list fabric store and (coincidentally) felt my empty tummy rumbling.  As I pulled out of the parking lot I noticed several out-of-place people standing outside a nondescript strip mall establishment.   Who are these people?  I asked myself.  Why are they just standing...on the sidewalk...on a Saturday morning?  And then I spotted the sign above them: \"The Bagel Man\" it read in big red letters.  A quick peek at Yelp told me all I needed to know: it was here that I'd be stopping for breakfast.  So I parked the car and got in line.  I didn't even care what was on the other end of that line.  I just knew it would be good.   I waited patiently, and eagerly, with the smell of fresh-baked goodness wafting past me.  I ogled the deli case, full of delicious-sounding house-mixed cream cheeses.  I thumbed my debit card as the line inched painfully forward.  Finally, it was almost my turn.  And just then, as if by magic, I heard two amazing words:  FRESH SESAME!  They were yelled from the bagel chef (er, baker?) as he tossed about a dozen puffy sesames into one of the many bagel baskets behind the front counter.  But the guy in front of me had heard the announcement too.  His forehead was practically sweating as he uttered the words \"I'll take a dozen sesame.\"  I wanted to beg him to take pity on me!  \"Give me my favorite bagel!  Please!  I love sesame bagels.  For goodness sake, I ONLY WANT ONE!\"  But I didn't.  As if by fate, though, his young daughter said \"Daddy, can I have a plain bagel?\"  So he swapped a sesame for a plain and you know how this story ends: the sesame bagel was mine.  ALL MINE!  I got it with a thick smear of lox cream cheese, quickly ran to my car, and devoured the whole thing in about 2 minutes.  Okay, 5 minutes.  And as I proceeded towards the airport and a flight home, I regretted I hadn't gotten one for the plane ride!",

They were ready to go for me when I walked in the door, all I had to do was pay. On top of that, they were actually baker's dozens. For this being my first time, I gotta say this place rocks.

No more debating which half of the bagel to eat first (I'm looking at you, Einsteins everything bagel!) Second, the bagel was perfectly baked, slightly crunchy outside, moist and chewy inside. And the scallion cream cheese was the icing in the delicious bagel cake. I also spoke to the extremely friendly owner, and I'm so glad to hear that business is going well for him. The only trouble with this place is it's very close to my office, and I'm afraid of all the money I'm going to be spending here!",

When I moved from NY to AZ over a decade ago, I failed to anticipate that the every day staples of food I grew up with exist in very limited supply out here. My every-Sunday-morning-breakfast consisted of a bagel w/ cream cheese and some smoked salmon. Throw in a cup of coffee, the morning paper, and you have my perfect Sunday morning. Fast forward to me residing in AZ; where are the bagels at?! No, I don't mean rolls that are shaped like donuts (most places that sell \"bagels\" like Chompies, Back East Bagels, and other chains that don't do this food justice). I mean big, crusty on the outside, and dense soft dough on the inside bagels. Here is where The Bagel Man comes in. The taste, the texture, and the quality is the closest to anything I grew up with. All of their variety tastes good and fresh. Their staff is very friendly. If you want the best, be there at opening; but if you get there before me, save me some 'Everything', 'Sesame', and 'Onion' bagels. BTW, their smoked salmon/lox with cream cheese actually has chunks of smoked salmon in it versus the other guys who whip their cream cheese to the point that all I see is some pink in my cream cheese. Thank you, The Bagel Man for restoring my Sunday mornings.",

The outside has a nice crunch and to top it all off they are probably a half inch larger than your normal bagel. I had them make me an Everything Bagel, toasted with cream cheese, bacon and egg.  A truly amazing taste experience - not too garlicky, not too salty, just perfection in the form of a boiled piece of dough.  If I lived in Phoenix I would be eating here every weekend. The only criticism is that the store's A/C doesn't ever seem to be working and so it gets a little warm if you decide to eat on site.   When I return to Atlanta I will be stopping here before I board the plane to purchase a few to show what a real bagel should be.   Kudos PHX - the best bagel West of the Mississippi!",

    "text": "I've only been to New York once.  So if you're looking for comparisons to independent bagel shops back east, you're barking up the wrong review.   That said, it sure seems like plenty of Yelp reviewers (and even the Phoenix New Times) are willing to stick their necks out and declare this valley bagel shop worthy of New York style buzz.  I like bagels.  I'm not devoted to bagels, but I like them.  So on a Saturday morning around 8am, I figured I'd stop by and see what all the fuss was all about.  Owner Kal Salih's The Bagel Man can be found on the southwest corner of 51st Street and Elliot in Ahwatukee, just a stone's throw west of the I-10 freeway.  This is actually the second location for The Bagel Man (the original is run by Kal's brother just outside NYC).  So this place at least on paper brings the east coast bagel credentials to the table.  Arriving at 8am, the place was packed with 12 patrons in line in front of me.  The lines can certainly be attributed to their popularity, but also to its tiny size (with seating for 15 only), and to a bit of disorganization (more on that in a bit).  After waiting my turn for about 15 minutes, I stepped up to give my order.  There are at least a dozen different types of bagels to choose from at any one time, with Kal's crew visible in the back making new ones as fast as they can crank them out.  You've got your plain, sesame, poppy, onion, garlic, salt, egg, honey wheat, pumpernickel rye, blueberry, cheese, and even your \"everything\" bagel.  But for my first foray, I got one of their Cinnamon Raisin bagels.  I opted to go with a breakfast sandwich in fact.  Sausage, egg, and cheese on a toasted cinnamon bagel to be exact.  Total cost?  $5.  Now here's where they lose me a little bit, and perhaps where The Bagel Man might be a victim of its own success.  Before, during and after I ordered, the front crew were kind of a mess.  They mixed up a number of orders, they forgot mine for a brief period, and there wasn't a consistent flow of responsibilities.  At times the crew stopped everything, huddled in a group for something they were confused about and left us hanging.  In fact the gal at the front register walked away to fix a coffee issue right in the middle of me telling her my order.  I'm not sure if today's front crew was less experienced or just not on their A game, but a more efficient operation would've kept the line moving at a much faster clip.  There, now that we've gotten that out of the way, how's the bagel (and more specifically the bagel sandwich I got)?  Divine.  The bagel is a perfect mix of crispy and chewy.  The cinnamon and raisins don't overpower the dough flavor as other bagel shops often do and its the perfect vehicle for all those breakfast fixins.  Most of the patrons in line this morning were ordering bagels by the dozens (one guy ordered 4 dozen).  Given how my bagel tasted, I get why.  So to sum up the verdict, yes I do buy the hype around the bagels themselves.  Fresh made, done right, and priced right.  The service at the counter left something to be desired, though clearly the long line suggests they have regulars ready and willing to accept a little inconvenience.  Seating is limited (I found one, but I got lucky), so chances are you'll be coming here for take out only.  New Yorkers, feel free to judge for yourself.  But locals are clearly going nuts for these bagels, and rightfully so.",

I remember one time while standing in line, they brought out fresh salt bagels and I got one with butter instead of cream cheese....it was so simple yet life changing!!! Still hot and super soft topped with creamy butter, it was just perfect. Typically, my go-to is some sort of sweet bagel like blueberry with a savory cream cheese and sausage with egg, topped with cheese. Or a savory bagel with a sweet cream cheese and same toppings. Or just have everything savory and switch it up with ham instead of sausage. Lol there are so many options and they are all THE BEST.",

I've been hearing about The Bagel Man from my girl Christie S. for like forever and when Amber R. got her delicious looking lox and bagel from here, I knew I had to make to trip out to The Bagel Man for some bagels! That and we were eating AYCE sushi nearby and I just so happened to remember this place. Wee!  These bagels are the size of my face. We came by to pick up six bagels and they gave us three for free! I want to say it's because he saw the absolute bagel-lust in my eyes and felt my love for carbs resonating out of me but in reality, it was nearing closing time and he knew it was my first visit. Way to win a gal over! The first bagel I tried was the Cheddar Jalapeno bagel with jalapeno cream cheese. My goodness... It was SO good! I would have bit my fist if I didn't already have a mouth full of bagel. Also, the everything bagel *is* everything.   I need to come back for their lox and bagel. I love me some salmon and I love me a good bagel. It's a no-brainer. This needs to happen soon.  *pterodactyl screech*",

I mean, that creamy goodness was just overflowing out of my bagel with every bite... Much like my little belly rolls will be overflowing out of my jeans after I come back for more and more bagels. love having so much cream cheese! However, the walnuts (or walnut taste?) advertised in the name were nowhere to be found. It's alright though, it was still sweet & crunchy.  Coffee options are limited to a big pre-brewed batch of caffeinated or decaf with a side or creamer and sugar. I wish they offered more drinks. The bagel sandwiches are definitely their forte. I can't wait to come back for more fresh-baked goodness!",

The bagels from this place are huge! You could probably make two meals out of them if you really wanted. We got them for breakfast and I ate half and could have saved the rest for later if I wasn't headed out that day.   I went with the cinnamon raisin bagel. It had a good consistency and wasn't overly chewy. The bagel was pretty flavorful. I went the maple walnut raisin cream cheese on it and it didn't disappoint. The raisins in the cream cheese were fresh. The cream cheese was very thick on my bagel and maybe too much for people, but I'd rather scrape some off than have too little.   For what it's worth I live in Albany, NY and still think these bagels are amazing...and I've had a lot of east coast bagels in my day!",

As I pulled into the parking spot, I noticed the Bagel Man right next door with a Boars Head sign in the window.  No contest.  I love Boars Head so I decided to go there instead.  From the outside, it doesn't look like much, it doesn't look like much from the inside either - small and no attention to the decor at all.  An incredibly friendly gentleman greeted me and he could immediately tell it was my first time there.  I told him I wanted a turkey sandwich with mozzarella and while trying to decide on what type of bread I wanted, he suggested I eat it on a bagel, he said that I can't find bagels like that anywhere else and promised me that this wouldn't be my last visit to his bagel shop.  I found him irresistible, it may have been the accent combined with the fact that I had just returned home from NYC where these little bagel shops owned by foreigners are in abundance.  Since it was late in the day, already past 2:00 by the time I was able to break away from work, the bagel options were slim so I settled on a salt bagel which I had never had before.  When I got back to my office and started eating my sandwich I realized that he was right, the bagel was delicious and he made a patron out of me.  I've been back four times and I get the same amazing service each time and I haven't veered from the salt bagel yet, it's so delicious.  When my dad wanted to meet me for breakfast we met here and he thought it was a great little bagel shop, too.  Next time there is a morning meeting at work, we're ordering from this place, forget Einstein's!",

Let me start by saying that this bagel shop is clean; that being said there is no atmosphere but who is expecting atmosphere in a bagel shop. The bagels are some of the best I've had in Phoenix and definitely worth the drive. I found the owner (I'm guessing he was the bagel man) to be polite, client orientated, and knowledgeable. If I didn't know any better I would say that the bagel man is from a small town somewhere, because memories of my childhood in the Midwest were reminiscent as we experienced all that was the bagels from the bagel man.  Mr. Bagel man all you need to do now is deliver bagels to my office in downtown phoenix and the world would be tolerable.",

    "text": "Hello. Need to educate. From Brooklyn Staten Island Catskills New York  and Nj. Loved the bagel mans style of bagel. Had the jalapeno plain with nothing on it and the everything plain nothing on it. Would come back and purchase bagels again. I have eaten from the best ny bagel bakeries in the ny area for 55 years. AUTHENTIC BAGELS ARE BOILED AND THEN BAKED. Like any baker it is an art. Fact, these bagels are excellent in their own right. They are not New York style bagels in the least bit. Anyone claiming they are is out of touch with reality. If you are from New York and are looking for authentic style jewish ny bagels then a trip to chompies bakery in Scottsdale is where they have the old style rye breads pumpernickel breads bagels and cakes that you grew up with back in the 1950's. Chompies also has a Sattelite store on w frye rd by the chandler mall. This being said I enjoy both styles very much. The classic ny chompies style bagel and the bagel mans recipe for his bagels which are excellent also. As for NEW JERSEY, there is no such thing as a nj style bagel. You can buy a bagel at 50 different stores in nj and get 50 different tastes and textures. There is only one way to make a classic by style Jewish bagel which is where they originated but there are thousands of variations. The bagel man makes one of the best variation of a NY STYLE BAGEL, but the taste and texture have nothing to do with the ny original. Call it an Arizona style bagel and it hands down wins the title best Arizona style bagel",

This place has some of the tastiest bagels I've come across here in the valley and they are all made fresh on premises using the old NY boil and bake. The Bagel Man himself seems to be working as a jack of all trades up front serving customer and working the bakery.   I was pretty impressed that the selection of bagels included some classics like salt (my favorite) and pumpernickel rye along with some unusual recipes including walnut multi grain (will be trying this) and chocolate chip.   My gourmet lunch sandwich ingredients couldn't really improve upon the perfectly cooked salt bagel they were placed upon. The sandwiches are piled with quality deli meats and cheeses and the 'gourmet list' included a choice of macaroni salad, chips or potato salad all for $5.50. I tried the macaroni salad, which was the  and it was very okay, also heavy on the mayo and light on flavor.  I am pretty happy to have another friendly option for breakfast around the office and will back for more salt bagels as well as to try the lox soon.",

I do a lot of traveling and I always look forward to enjoying a fresh bagel whenever I get to the east coast.  Authentic New York Bagels are very hard to find on the west coast.  This morning I was out and about and decided to stop in and pick up some bagels to share.  The Bagel Man greeted me as soon as I walked in the door and cheerfully asked if I had been in before.  I smiled and said no.  As I was giving him my order.  I asked him if he made the bagels on the premises; he cheerfully said yes and I told him I was excited to give them a try.  He said that I would be back!  He told me how he prepared them and I told him that I realy enjoyed the bagles in New York; he said I would be happy I found the shop!  He was right!  The bagels are perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside with wonderful flavor.  When I bite into one I can see the Statue of Liberty through the misty haze...  ...anyway The Bagel Man is highly recommened and you won't be disappionted!",

I got a bacon, egg, and cheese everything bagel, and my two small kids shared a blueberry bagel with cream cheese.

There are only 2 people working usually and everytime I have been there it has been PACKED so you probably got there during or right after a rush.

If you're paying $9 for a bagel with lox & the works, you expect it to be worth it but I was disappointed. I had to come home and add more cream cheese and capers, that was fine,...what was so upsetting is that the bagel was at least one day old so it was stale and not the usual quality. I was so surprised because I have had great bagels here for so long! The owner made the bagel too which was so upsetting. I will give The Bagel Man another try because as I stated they're usually fantastic but I hope today was just an \" off \" day. Cal is great but he's going to have to continue with his usual quality product for me to keep coming back.",

It will be crackly on the outside and chewy and tender on the inside. Toasting is for store bought bagels.  The service here is a little haphazard, many of the workers will try and take your order, just talk to one of them and your order will be fulfilled. I had an Everything Bagel with Sliced Lox Sandwich. 3 days in a row. And while the salty Lox maybe the big draw for some, the bagel was the star of the show. Long meetings and lactose intolerance prevented me from enjoying the simple delights of a Bagel and Cream Cheese (of which they have many flavors). But I can tell you these Bagels are good enough to eat dry.  Do not miss out on this place. If you are staying at the Sheraton, brave that 120 parking lot. It is worth even that.",

I moved 6 years ago to CA and could not find a single bagel place that even touched what I was used to. So I'd have my mom just send me bagels! Although not as a fresh, it was a better alternative. So, when I moved to Tempe, I was VERY skeptical to find a place that I'd like.  I looked up bagel shops on Yelp and found The Bagel Man. Many other east coasters approved so I figured I'd give it a try. I went in on a Sunday morning around 7:30am and there were only a few people there. I think I was in and out in about 5 minutes! Their customer service was fantastic!  The bagels themselves were exactly what I was hoping for. They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Tasted like NY heaven to me!   The only downfall I had was that my bagel was a bit too over cooked and a little burnt-ish on the outside. But I bought a half dozen and no others were like that. I'd give them a 4.5 stars if I could. I certainly will be going back!!",

    "text": "Bagel Man's rudeness exceeds his lack of business sense.   When trying to buy 6 pumpernickel, 6 whole wheat, and some egg bagels, Bagel Man snapped \"My bagels are expensive and you will be taking them away from my other customers.\"  What's that all about?   Isn't Bagel Man in the business to make and sell bagels?  When presenting a coupon to buy a dozen and get 3 free (which we've used many times) we were told that the coupon was counterfeit and he did not want to honor it, but did so with a growl of anger.  Another problem is the inconsistency of the bagels.  Sometimes they are dry and when cut, have air holes.   Sometimes they are uneven with rather large holes and misshapen.  Sometimes they have a crusty outside like they have been egg washed.  I've actually cut one and the whole outside crust fell off, leaving very little bagel left. The place is dirty and tables and floor are speckled with crumbs.    Bagel Man should be baking enough bagels to satisfy all his customers, not scold them for ordering them.  We have given up on Bagel Man.",

Starbucks, Einstein bagels are the same in my opinion.  However I found bagel man on yelp as I was looking for a breakfast joint.  I'll have to admit The bagels are the best in town as they are made fresh everyday.  I had the lox onion bagel with cream cheese scallions and my husband had the works on a garlic bagel.   That's was the beginning of my bagel addiction.  I come atleast twice a week and get the breakfast bagel that comes with bacon, egg and cheese.  They have a variety of bagels to choose from and I've had a few and they all taste great.  Go get yours today!",

A nice lady from the kitchen had to come out and help.  Apparently though, nobody but the owner is allowed to handle the money so he finally broke off his conversation and rang up the sale.  I didn't like the way he treated the nice lady and I was troubled by the way she seemed overly deferential to him and almost frightened.    Bagels are okay but nothing special.  Would NOT go back!

My rating compares these bagels to those that I have tried out of a bag at a grocery store, to chains that claim bagels should be smart, and to the only other family owned shop in the east valley that claims they know bagels for 'back east'. Bagel man bagels are exeptionally larger and pretty much consistent in their round,donut-shape, something that constantly bothers me about the competitor. Because these have a consistant round puffy shape, they might not be as dense and crusty on the outside when stored and reheated in the toaster, which is what I like to do. Bottom line, i like the huge, round puffy shape. I also love their walnut rasin cream cheese but for me this is definitely an eat the same day bagel, which is fine with me. This is a very basic, tiny, family owned shop that specializes in very good bagels and a few freshly made cream cheese selections. It has a counter with basic coffee and a fountain drink machine, that's all!!! Come here and rate it for the bagels only.",

Get the Lox . . . special ordered with bacon.  Yes.  Trust me.  Unkosher that bad boy.  Garlic toasted bagel, house made scallion cream cheese, Lox AND bacon.  The silky smoked salmon with crispy bacon . . . fantastic.  Everything is held together with excellent bagels that frankly put Chompie's to shame.  Seriously.  And the house made cream cheeses . . . smooth and creamy and decadent.  Yes, decadent.  And they certainly do not skimp on the bacon.

The Man knows how to make bagels, people. And bialys! Bialys, I tell you: I wanted to cry when I saw them.   Anywho, my SILs have lived in the 'Tuk forever,  when we moved here they told us see the Man about some NY style bagels. The first time we went it was at opening, and our bagels were still hot! The salt and pumpernickel are my favorites; Scott is an everything or egg man: \"Goo goo g' joob\" (that's the Beatles, millennials) When my Mom was here, she asked for bagels every day: Brooklyn born and bred stamp of approval!  They do run out of bagels early, you will encounter a line occasionally, but they move quick. 5* as good as it gets in PHX fo sho!   * closed Mondays * ** they have deli sammies ** ** breakfast menu *** **** nice lox and yummy homemade cream cheese varieties ****",

For someone who really knows the real thing, it is so different than that. Maybe it's nostalgia for the delectable deliciousness of a semi hard exterior with a fluffy interior. Or the subtle semi salty after taste. The smear should also be of high quality. It's not Philadelphia cream cheese. A good bagel place will make their own.  The Bagel man is definitely that. This is by far the best bagel place west of the Mississippi. It honestly competes and is on par with what New York has to offer. The owner is a kind man who knows what he is doing and remembers his customers even after long absences.",

He asked me what other bagels did I want, I told him, but he didn't add them. When I got home, I had 9 bagels and paid 12.00 for a dozen. The closed right after we bought our order so no correction .   Taste - These taste good. If you like soft slightly sweet pizza crust, this is what it taste like. Slightly crusty on the outside and spongy soft on the inside with cornmeal on the bottom. Not worth the price I paid for them though.",

We walked in and were greeted by some awesome staff! They were all way nice and helpful with recommendations. As we looked over the menu a few people stopped in that seemed to be regulars, and they knew their names, orders, and asked them about personal things they had done that they obviously had heard about last time. Nice work! That's a touch of customer service many restaurants will never get to.  The bacon breakfast bagel on the salt bagel was delicious! And the everything with the cinnamon walnut spread was amazing. I'm really sad I'm only in town for a day or two or this would be my new weekly go to.",

On postmates it gave an option to choose bread or bagel with the sandwiches, but not a type of bagel. The driver called me and told me they made the sandwiches on cinnamon raisin bagels. I asked him to see if they would remake them, as this was not what I ordered and it makes no sense to make an egg salad sandwich on a cinnamon raisin bagel. They refused to remake them and charged me for them. This isn't what I ordered. Now I have to spend even more money to order food somewhere else. The food I was able to eat was so/ so at the best. As a local business owner myself this is frustrating to me that they wouldn't ensure the companies they work with have appropriate options on their app, wouldn't use common sense and wouldn't spend a couple dollars to make it right.",

Maybe I am just a bit green and have never experienced a True bagel before (I am a native Phoenician) but Bagel Man seriously has the best bagels I have ever tasted in my entire life.   I stop by here once a week or so before work and usually get an egg and cheese sandwich on an everything bagel, or a cheese bagel toasted with veggie cream cheese. The prices are very, very reasonable. I think they charge me less for coffee than Circle K, and the coffee is much better. I have never been by when the coffee is cold or stale.  The bagels are not the only reason this place earns 5 stars though.. The staff at this place are absolutely delightful. They are all so nice and friendly and work very hard to get you your order as quickly as possible. The owner is always so happy, and it is really neat to see how someones business can really succeed with love, dedication and hard work.   The only thing I want to caution Yelpers about is if you plan on hitting this place before work, maybe call in your order. Sometimes it can get a bit chaotic here, and you wouldn't want to be late to work because you were waiting for your bagel!",

The place is TINY and it was getting pretty hot in there but, with the exception of the heat, I felt like I was time machined back to when I worked at JFK airport and it was my turn to pick up our regular order of bagels from the tiny shop just downstairs from our office.  You could almost say this guy is like a \"Bagel Nazi\" in the most complementary way but I think he's more like a \"Bagel Whisperer.\"  He creates work-of-art bagels and has to train the uneducated customers.  In front of me, a guy with the whole-arm tattoos and a forward-facing Coyotes cap read off his orders (no orders are \"taken\" they are just spoken and relayed to the back kitchen).  He read, \"One everything bagel with the bread dug out.\"  The owner first just looked at him like he was speaking a foreign language, and then said, \"Why would you wanna do that?\"  The Coyote fan said, \"It's for my mother in law.\"  The bagel man had a serious look of disdain on his face and said very little after that.  The next guy had a little kid with him and said, \"One toasted plain bagel with cream cheese...\" and the Owner interrupted, \"These bagels are very hot, you don't need to toast them.\"  The guy was about to speak again and he said, \"TRUST me.\"  I had to speak up, \"Trust him,\" I said.    These bagels brought me back to those days in Queens when the bagels were so fresh that the idea of toasting them was,sacrilege.   While I was waiting a good 20 minutes in line, all but three types of bagels were sold out and two pans came out to replace two types.  I'm sure this seems like a bad thing to some people but when I see bagels being brought out and being sold out constantly, I know that whatever I end up with is going to be insanely good.  Go  here!  And try read-up on and respect,  \"Bageletiquette.\"",

I was up early this morning wondering who was open at 5:30 a.m., and was also looking for a place I've never been and this joint fit the bill.  I had a honey wheat bagel toasted with the honey almond spread and it was delicious!  Warm and chewy and just what my belly needed that early in the morning.  The employees were fast and friendly too.  I've attached photos of their menu as of today.  This would be a perfect stop before a hike or bike ride on South Mountain.  And a great stop for lunch when you're done.  I can't wait to grab the unsuspecting Mr. M and go back.  The only reason I would ever go back to Einstein Bros. was if I was craving a cinn/sugar bagel.",

That long walk turned into an insanely long walk and I feel like we walked to the next state - long story short we were hungry and wandered into some sort of industrial park with not a coffee shop to be found.  We kept walking and found a small strip mall with the only open business at the time... The Bagel Man.  We popped in for two coffees and bagels.  The Bagels were good, but I'm from the American North East - we have high standards for our bagels...so there is good and then there is GOOD.  This was good.  The coffee was basic, the service was friendly and really quick.  It is a tiny little place with very limited seating so if you don't get in early, you are likely to have a tough time finding some place to sit.  Out door seating is available - but do you really want to do that in the Arizona sun?",

These suckers are huge, fresh and there are a variety of flavor options to choose from with sandwiches, bagels and fresh cream cheese. The shop isn't anything to look at, but they make up for it with the quality of their food and the kindness of their staff. The honey walnut spread is great as are the cheese and everything bagels (not with that spread...unless special flavor combos float your boat. :-) Go at an off hour in the morning to avoid crowds and sell-outs and don't plan on eating there, as seating is sparse and cramped right against the ordering area.

    "text": "The Bagel Man has certainly earned that title and easily at that. The attention to detail of his craft is second to none in the entire state of Arizona. Hands-down the best bagel sandwich I have ever had in AZ.  I ordered the bacon, sausage, egg and cheese sandwich on a pumpernickel rye bagel. Yes, pumpernickel rye. Not the average bagel, this one was expertly crafted and baked to perfection. The sausage was flavorful and of great quality. The bacon is thick and crispy with incredible flavor that's apparent in every bite, not that soggy \"bacon\" that's served at other places. This bacon was hearty. It's easy to tell that they use real cheese and they have high quality meats. The cheese was thick and melted into everything that was in the bagel. The eggs were just right, not too greasy, not too salty. Everything in the sand which was just perfect. As I said, best bagel sandwich in AZ. The coffee is piping hot, just the way I like it. Not extra bold... smooth flavor but still certainly delivers that \"kick\" that is needed in the morning! Definitely coming back to try the Lox on an Onion Bialy bagel and after that I must explore their lunch menu. Well deserved Five Stars for the best bagel sandwich in AZ!",
