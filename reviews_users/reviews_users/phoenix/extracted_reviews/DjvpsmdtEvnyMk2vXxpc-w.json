The food and drinks are much more casual compared to the Watershed. I had soup and salad and my friend had a burger. We enjoyed our food and the service was great.  The view of the lake is not as good as The Watershed.  Overall, it was a good experience, but I don't see any reason why I would come back.",

Menu has changed but we have a party here every year of 8-12 people and everyone's able to find something. Good selection of beer and such. It's is an outdoor eatery, food may cool off fast.. sometimes they have live music so maybe hard to carry on a conversation, but it's a fun fun place with the right people!",

    "text": "This is for a visit from October 2015.   A big group of us were in town for an event and made reservations at Pier 54 for a group dinner. The service was not good at all. We were 20 people separated into multiple tables. It took a while for the waiter to come and take our orders and to bring us our drinks. Then, things got worse when it started to rain! Obviously, the restaurant cannot control that, but what they can control is them helping us and they didn't. We had to move the tables ourselves underneath the limited area that was covered and at one point, the waiter was just standing there watching us scramble and move the tables and didn't even do anything. When the food came, it was cold and dry. And when we asked for our check, the waiter offered separate bills for each table which we gladly accepted since she offered and then later when we expressed concern about how long the bill took, the owner came out and said it took so long because we asked for separate checks. Hmm.. let's rewind there... the waiter offered so we gladly accepted otherwise we all had cash to pay for the bill. My last comment is that I honestly think this restaurant shouldn't have taken our reservation because they were not equipped to serve such a big party.",

The view is nice and I believe they count on their local customers from the surrounding houses for business. Food is a hit or miss too. Sometimes they have really nice food. Sometimes the burgers are cold. And unfortunately, I encountered some rude behavior from the waiters too.",

    "text": "WOW! What a nightmare this place is! If I were you I would stay far away. I was there this last Thursday around 5PM. We were a party of 5. We were greeted pretty quickly, drink order taken, but then waited for drinks to arrive for at least 15 minutes.The bar was busy and taken care of , our waitress only had two other tables. Finally ordered. Food started to come out. Two of ordered fish and chips. Both came out without tarter, we had ordered extra. Waitress said they were out of tarter. We both said we didn't want fish W/O tarter. She took them back . I then ordered a burger. It came out almost raw, and smelled like rotten meat. Fries were ice cold. I sent that back and said I was done, I wanted nothing else. As my party was finished with their meals the waitress bring me another plate of fish and chips and says that they \"mixed\" up some tarter sauce. I kid you not , the tarter sauce was pink colored. I thought it was strange she didn't ask me before doing this, but the attempt to please was halted. Everything on this plate was cold as well. I think they took my other fries and fish I sent back and put them on a new plate with the \"mixed\" up tarter.  Believe me out there, I am not that fussy , but this place really takes the cake!! RUN! To top everything off , no one ever came out to see what was going on, apologize, try and correct the problems the waitress was having...nothing. The waitress just said she wouldn't charging us for what was sent back!! Yikes! Like she what we were going to pay for any of it?? Pier 54...hope you read these reviews..you really need a serious makeover of staff and policy.",

    "text": "Dropped by for dinner recently with a couple friends who are vegetarian. Pier 54 doesn't have anything for vegetarians aside from salad and soup. There was pizza and grilled cheese on the kid's menu and we asked if they could make an adult size version of that since we were hungry for some heavy food but they don't do that. My vegetarian friends ordered the soup that was available for the day (tomato soup) and all of us gave it a taste and no one liked it much. I ordered the chicken skewers, hoping for a nice filling meal and I got two thin sticks of chicken with a side of fries. The fries on the side were not good either. I had checked out the pics on yelp before heading down there and it seemed much better than when we went there ourselves but maybe it was an off night. For dinner, it wasn't my favorite as none of us were very happy with our meals. The redeeming quality of the place was the drinks! The drinks were fabulous! If you're a fan of sweet cocktails, the Malibu Mai Tai and the White Gummy Bear are awesome! My conclusion would be that I would go to this place for drinks and maybe try it out for breakfast, but not for dinner and definitely not if you're a vegetarian. Seems to me that this place has its specialties that it makes really well and you may want to stick to if you go there. Might be best to ask the servers what they think Pier 54 makes really well and go for it because otherwise you may end up with something not so great.",

Our food was pretty good but it took forever to get to us. I had gone on a Saturday night for my birthday so I was planning on having some drinks but my waiter was hard to get a hold of and she only stopped once to serve us some more water. On the other hand if you mention your birthday they will bring you a slice of cheesecake but according to my waiter they don't sing happy birthday. Overall this is more of a place to go and have some drinks with a couple of friends but I suggest you eat before you go because the food takes forever.",

    "text": "Just came here on a slow Saturday. My girlfriend and I ordered an omelet, skillet and biscuits n' gravy. The food came out and nothing was as expected. The omelet was under cooked and watery, the skillet was just a mush of things thrown together and the biscuits were tiny with the gravy barely noticeable. In fact the gravy looked clear because it was also so watered down. The only thing we really couldn't look past was the omelet. My girlfriend tried it to make sure it wasn't how it was supposed to be and the one bite made her feel sick. Between the two of us we've had many years working in the restaurant industry so we are very patient and neither of us hardly ever complain. However we decided we had to send back at least the omelet. That was the plan at least except our server didn't return until we were ready for the check about 30 min later. She walked past us several times though and didn't acknowledge us or the empty coffee cup, the uneaten food or the empty waters. We were finally able to ask for the check and inform her that the omelet was under cooked after we ended up splitting my unappetizing skillet. When she returned with the check she said she let the kitchen know about the omelet and they said \"it wasn't undercooked that's how it comes.\" It was a final test of patience as I wasn't about to argue about a dish as simple as an omelet that was raw inside and had a pool of liquid In and around it. We left having experienced the worst food and service we've ever had together.",

The views and setting are stunning and well worth the trip through the neighborhood to get there. The giant fans were a big detraction (kinda noisey but you can't avoid them) and the cigarette smoke from a fellow diner was gross. We will go again and hope for better service next time. I'm sure as the weather continues to cool the fans will be uncessary. Hopefully we won't encounter any smokers again.",

    "text": "I was disappointed with this establisment. The food was average, with my dogs I was relegated to a small strip of the patio but, worse, I had asked that my fries not be darkly fried, which they accomodated. However, the chef saw fit to use burnt toast; actually black, on my sandwhich, turning it around so I didn't notice it until I bit into it. I told the waiter. I don't know if he bothered to report it. They certainly didn't make it up to me. Finally, there are some specials, but they are only for two people or more. As a single person, they severely limit my options in this regard. I gave the waiter a 15% tip; I've worked as waitstaff before. He had forgotten my drink. I normally tip 20% or more. Needless to say, I probably won't go back.",

We ordered chicken tenders and a Ruben, this was not a large or complex order. Not one patron at the establishment had food. All I could get is \"we're working on it\".  Poor excuse for a restaurant.

They have added some great salads, excellent sandwiches, and a few cool appetizers to freshen things up.   I will take pictures of the menu on my next visit, but it was late and I was enjoying wine with friends to get into trying to update yelp.    On this visit I kept it simple, BBQ sliders with fries, bottle of house red, and these awesome smores puffs things that made my week. All three items were great, as was the service. The BBQ pulled pork was juicy, with a hint of heat, and the fries seem to be house made fresh cut, which is awesome for a small local establishment.   This lakeside spot is great for a lazy day of drinking or  nice bite to eat with family & friends. It doesn't hurt that the food is great, the staff is friendly and the drinks are cold while being within in riding distance via beach cruiser from my home.",

I would definitely come again for taco tuesday or happy hour. The deals for couples are also interesting. Definitely worth the view and going somewhere unique in Tempe .",

    "text": "We live close to Pier 54 and visit it occasionally for a drink or light dinner.  It's a nice change to be able to sit outside in Arizona when the weather allows, and the weekend live music is pleasant and not overwhelming.    Pros: Food.  Really good and at a reasonable price.  Not too fancy, but a cut above the usual bar food you'd expect from this kind of place.  The sandwiches and flatbreads are nicely prepared.   View:  Situated on Tempe's Lakes development, Pier 54 offers a nice view with plenty of seating when the lower level (lakeside) is open.  And the misting system is much better than other outside bars in the summer, if sometimes a bit too \"wet\".    Dog friendly: Dogs are welcome, and we enjoy this feature.  Entertainment:  Subtle guitar players on weekends.  Not too loud to drown out conversation.    Cons: Service:  We'd give it a higher rating if it wasn't for the spotty service.  If the bar is over half full, service is dicey, particularly on weekends.  If you're sitting at the bar, it's quite efficient, but Pier 54 needs to work on their staffing needs.  We've regularly waited ten minutes for our first contact with a server, almost to the point of walking out.  Either hire enough servers or schedule more at heavy traffic times.  That said, all the wait staff we've had were friendly and pleasant.    Decor: Pier 54 could use a facelift.  The tables and bar are old and dingy, and the overall decor looks like it was slapped together by college kids.  While cleanliness is average, the place is is serious need of a makeover.  Summary:  With the nicely appointed and great food offered by Waterhouse next door, Pier 54 faces some stiff competition, but it's nice for what it offers.  I'd recommend weekday nights until they figure out how to properly staff the restaurant.  Nice little neighborhood pub.   Note:  This is a bar that permits smoking as it's all \"outdoor\".",

My order wasn't good at all, chicken w/coliflower pure or i don't know what that was.  Music very loud, couldn't enjoy the songs; we were all sweating by the time we had our meals served.

If you go to eat, don't expect a lot.  I ordered the lamb kabobs with the grilled veggies.  The two kabobs were about six inches long with small chunks of lamb.  They were placed on the plate--no rice.  I asked for the grilled veggies for my side.  The veggies were sliced Brussels sprouts, broccoli and yellow squash.  I thought that was the strangest combination of \"grilled\" veggies especially to go with lamb.  My cousin ordered the mahi-mahi tacos ($11.95, I believe).  It happened to be Taco Tuesday, but we didn't know until later.  His three tacos were small street tacos with about a 2x1 inch piece of fish on each one.  There was some guacamole sauce in top.  No sides, nothing but three street tacos which he gulped down in less than five minutes.  When we got the bill, the had been charged $9.95--Taco Tuesday prices we surmised, but then we wondered if those were the normal tacos or if they were Taco Tuesday tacos.  Appetizers or burgers are probably good, but maybe ask questions (which we didn't do--who would have thought?)  I'll go back but with no expectations.",

The singer tonight was fantastic, great talent they found in him (unfortunately didn't catch his name). The meat and cheese played were very satisfying, the accompanying bread was crispy yet somehow soft. A perfect pairing.   The rest however was just awful. To start the service was terrible. took forever to even be served water, let alone get our order taken because he just kept walking by. We waited ~40 mins to get said cheese and meat platters! Then the food....dreadful. Nobody finished their meals. They forget to even put my order in. The salmon was dry as a rock, the steak skewers were tough and overcooked, and they didn't have any of their tacos on the menu except brisket...and we don't think there was even any brisket under the huge beds of cabbage!   Upside, if you spend $25 between two people you get a free bottle of house wine ($25 isn't even worth it though unfortunately).",

It only has outdoor seating and they do take reservations although the couple of times we have been there we have been able to find a place to sit down.   Food and service have been good when we were there. I have tried the flatbread and the turkey con chile sandwich. They were both fine. My husband has tried fish and chips and a burger. I prefer crispy fries and these are hand cut so not my favorite, but had no complaints, just preference. Not amazing, but it's really more about a nice place to sit outside, relax and enjoy being near water.   One other time we stopped by with friends after trying dinner next door on a Saturday night and they had live music and that was good too!",

We didn't receive our food until about 1:30. Absolutely horrible. Our server ran his butt off trying to wait on the whole patio. Why they had only one server for an entire patio on Mother's Day, blows my mind. Once the food came it was average at best. Nothing to write home about. My boyfriend got the special which was a lamb shank with mashed potatoes. He said it was absolutely flavorless and gross. Even the table next to us asked what it was and said it looked disgusting. The manager really needs to realize they need more staff especially on a holiday to accommodate everyone and work on their food.",

First of all I love pier 54 because it is a gorgeous scenery and chill spot to have a drink. You guys have a PRIME location but your losing local customers like me and at least 10 of my friends because the food is god awful and your bar is starting to look trashy. I've been in the restaurant business my entire life and alllll you need to do is seriously update your menu , use good  fresh food , and spend a couple 1000$ to spruce up the place. Everything is torn and ragged and so sad to see it start to look so bad. I've returned my food there not once , not twice but 3 times and I don't ever return my food. My burger was burnt and dry , fries were so over seasoned I chocked , my spinach dip had a giant piece of plastic in it, and the salmon salad tasted like it was caught in the dirty lake. Lastly the water just the water tastes like I'm drinking directly from the lake . Please please please just make some changes I want to love this place so badly!!! I'll come help you if I need to !!! The owners deserve a steady stream of business but you gotta realize you need to make some changes !",

Once we got our food, it started pouring.  Since the entire restaurant is outdoors, a good amount of the tables are uncovered.  No one came out to help us.  We covered our food with napkins and started to move the tables ourselves.  I understand mother nature is out of their control, but they could have done more to help us. We asked the server to close us out and after 20 minutes, still had no check.  I went and asked her again and told her I was in a rush to get somewhere else..still no check.  The third time, i brought cash to pay.  She went back in the kitchen and didn't come back out for another 10+ minutes.  We were close to just walking out. (i honestly don't think the server would've even noticed)  From the time we asked for the check till when we left was almost 45 minutes. I understand that good service can be difficult with big groups, but you would think that so many paying customers, they would try a bit harder to provide better service. Although there were 20 of us, we sat at separate tables with separate checks.  5 tables of 4 people could not have been that difficult.   We sat down at 5:30pm and left at 8:00pm to go eat dinner somewhere else.  It took 2.5 hours for 3 apps, one sandwich and 2 drinks...that is pretty unacceptable.   I am only giving them 2 stars because of the nice view and the tasty cheese balls.",

We got there and they were busy but with several tables opened and maybe two people at he bar. When we walked in, there was not one server on the floor and the bartender was missing as well. After waiting a few minutes someone came out of the \"kitchen\" and I asked about seating. I was told it was open seating with the exception of the downstairs area.. well I didn't even know they had a downstairs so I was fine. We sat down, just two of us, and proceeded to look at the menu.  We waited for about 15 min and not one person acknowledged us during this time.  No one offered water ... mind you this was Saturday afternoon (12:30) and it was quite warm/hot.  Water would have been nice. After another 5 min or so we decided to get up and leave.. on our way out, a waiter did notice us but made no attempt to talk/stop us. During our 10-15 min there we had noticed three people walk in and sit at the bar, bartender came out and promptly served them their drinks... I wished we had sat at the bar.  We ended up leaving because even though we were not in a hurry, the fact that no one even acknowledged us or offered water made it not worth waiting to see how bad the rest of the service was going to be... not sure if I would ever want to come back, to bad because they seemed kind of a fun casual place to hang out.",

The food has been consistently very good (3 to 4 stars) and the service has always been very good as well (4 to 5 stars).  Waterside seating is unbeatable in the desert (5 stars)!  Twice I have had unpleasant experiences due to what I feel are rude or inconsiderate smokers who want to sit upwind of non-smokers.  Seriously, if you are sensitive to this do not eat or drink here because this is a 'smokers rights' place as I was told by a long time local the first time it happened.  I suggest an upwind non-smoking area be designated to include the tables between the bar and lakeside seating areas since this is the prevailing wind direction.  Only about 17% of people smoke these days so it seems poor business practice to cater to this minority of customers at the expense of the 83% majority.  Just went back after a long while and now there's a no smoking area so I am raising my rating to 4 stars.",

We came on Friday night at 10:15 pm we were greeted and a guy told us that it's self seated and he brought us the food menu as well the drinks menu and he was nice and welcoming. A 20 - 25 minutes later after failure tries to call any one to take our orders a guy named Miles came to us with such an ignorant attitude and said hey guys the kitchen is closed! No food just drinks!! We waited this long with the food menus and he saw us but didn't approach to us until around 10:40 pm. We told him that we came for dinner not drinks and that we were here at for 25 minutes and they gave us the food menus and he rudely said kitchen closed just drinks and took the food menus away!! That's really rude and ignorant and a horrible service from him! With no apologies and no attempt to solve the issue he just gave us the \"unwelcome\" treatment and we left because we were really disappointed and he said ok then bye! OMG if I was the owner I would be ashamed of him.. even the guy who greeted us was upset watching us being treated like that, he waisted out time for half an hour or so, he definitely ruined our night, and still he didn't apologized about his mistake! Why would they greet us and give us the menus unless they were welling to serve us diner, but obviously this Miles didn't like us and didn't want to serve us. He didn't even try to see if they can make us those burgers and didn't offer a snack or bar food. We talked to the bartender and he gave us the owners number and he apologized as he was nice and polite but omg this Miles was really the worst server I ever met! I would never ever go back again just because of him and I really wanted to give this place a try as I live 3 minutes away. Good job making customers run away Miles (y)",

Service is comparable to any other bar/sports bar kind of joint, and the laid back atmosphere is part of that.",

Come here if you want to kick back chill.... Not if you're uptight and impatient. The service can be slow but it's not a fast paced type of place. So if you wanna chill outdoors by the water with a couple drinks and appetizers, this place is a perfect gem.",

Apparently I have to come back with my dog in order to sit in that area. While our waitress was very nice the service was very slow and the food was terrible.

The first time we went here our burgers were more on the well done side rather than medium as requested, but were still tasty. I've also had the salmon BLT, which had a generous portion of tender salmon with crispy bacon and lettuce.   While I've enjoyed the food here, service can be hit or miss depending on how busy it is. On our last visit they were severely understaffed and the poor waitress was the only one there to check up on a nearly full seating of tables.  The plus of outside seating is that they are extremely dog friendly. The minus of eating outside (If you are sensitive to smoke) is the plethora of smokers that tend to frequent this restaurant.  While the atmosphere is great, some of the chairs could use some cleaning or replacement. The ones at our table had cushions that were supposed to be a cream color, but had some dirty brown spots on them.  Overall I'll definitely be coming here again to try more of their menu items, but probably at a less busy time.",

I can't even begin to describe all the mouthwatering food I ate here, from meat or cheese platters, to burgers, to lamb skewers, to Romanian sausages (mici), even the salads taste amazingly good. I love their food presentation, which teases my taste buds as soon as the plate is in front of me (hence all the photos I take!). A few weeks ago, I had the best burger ever, juicy, with avocado and finished with an egg.... Just reminding myself of those flavors makes me salivate! I also had a Hungarian soup (unfortunately I do not remember the name of it), so good I ended up wiping the inside of the bowl with a piece of bread (manners had no room here!). We also had a few parties held at Pier 54 and they met all our expectations. The live music is different every week (I believe Thursday to Saturday) and I love that they encourage local musicians to come and showcase their creativity. Oh, and I should also mention the sunsets, so unique in Arizona but even better from one of tables at Pier 54, right on the lake's shore. Did I mention we eat there at least once a week????",

She, her husband and the AMAZING bartender Emily helped us set up and find us obscure things we needed. Her husband also helped me hookup a slideshow and video to all the televisions, which was a big hit! Also, Emily was truly exceptional. Her services and personality really elevated the event to another level. The bridal shower was amazing and I couldn't have been happier with the result. We served a brunch buffet and mimosas. The food was delicious and the mimosas were unlimited and a big hit! I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND Pier 54 for any event hosting. Thank you Pier 54 for hosting a day my bride will never forget.",

As a vegetarian there is not much to eat, and a grilled cheese is a good go-to. It is absolutely ridiculous that I cannot eat a meal they usually offer just because of the time of day. My entire family and I would go there for dinner all the time if not for this, so they've lost a lot of business. This rule makes absolutely zero sense and is losing them a ton of business, and not just from my family, as the waitresses said many others have the same issue. Awful.",

However, sitting by the bar looking out to the lake, especially during sunset, is an awesome trade-off. Our server was very nice and attentive. She was also the bartender who made our awesome drinks: Manhattan and Moscow Mules. She even asked for a whiskey preference when it comes to Manhattan :)   We ordered a grilled salmon with a side of rice and a affettato misto sandwich with fries. Sadly, the food couldn't compare to the great service and drinks. My sandwich was VERY dry. The ciabatta bread was a little bit stale. The supposed-to-be homemade pesto is too basil-y and tasted like it came from a store-bought jar. The lettuce was also not so fresh-looking. At this point, the only thing I was looking forward to trying is my side order of simply basic fries. It turned out to be so-so: plain and not crispy :( My friend's salmon was gamey and the rice was super bland, which was describe to be somewhat like a grainy mush...   Overall, great atmosphere for a casual and fun date, awesome drinks, decent price. However, food needs a lot of improvement so maybe eat before then come by for drinks afterward!",

Just rude. I'll stick to the watershed next door.  Update: my shrimp was raw !",

    "text": "I visited Pier 54 about 3 weeks ago after a spring training game with some friends. The first thing I liked about this place is that it is an outdoor setting only. The combination of great Arizona weather and the fact it sits waterside makes for a really laid back and comfortable setting. The live music only further enhances one's experience.The wait staff is attentive and quick to serve. Sit back grab a beer and enjoy the view, cause the food takes some time getting to the table, but that is not necessarily a bad thing in my opinion. I had the Southwest Style burger, which was good, but not quite what I expected totally. Though I'm not a big beer drinker and nowhere close to being a connoisseur, this is the place where I was first introduced to Kronenbourg beer. The crab cakes as an appetizer are worth a try.  A great local hangout.",

    "text": "Waterfront dining in the East Valley that doesn't cost you an arm and a leg....who would have thought?  Now the food is average bar style foods, wings, burgers, popcorn chicken...not fine dining by any means, but plentiful and comforting. They do have some seafood dishes...but after our first experience I tend to avoid the seafood. I had ordered the artichoke & crab dip and salmon salad, which I happily ate, and my husband shared, and we both had significant GI distress that night. However, I think this must be the rare event, and to be fair, we tend to have delicate GI systems.   The service tends to be inconsistent, more often slow than not, but always friendly and polite. The bar area seems comfortable and reminds me of Cheers...there are always a few people sitting there enjoying their beers and watching the TVs. I keep expecting to see Norm and Cliff sitting there.  But it's all about the view and atmosphere at this place. It's cozy, even though it's outdoors, with a very pretty and relaxing water view as the occasional boat is trolling around, and stylish homes line the shores. Living in the neighborhood makes it very easy to visit this place. I don't think I would ever drive here for the food, but if I were desperately missing a lake or oceanview, this might be a reasonable substitute.  Oh yeah, apparently although they used to allow dogs on the patio, they're no longer allowed to. We end up tying our pooch near the door so that she gets to meet and greet people as they walk through.",

The bartenders were very friendly, but as the menu states pretty clearly, don't expect fast service.  There were two bartenders servicing the entire place so it seems like they plan on being understaffed.  The menu is pretty big, and they've given many of their dishes fun \"nautical\" names.  However, it's pretty standard fare, so don't expect anything very unique from your food.  I will definately be returning for drinks after I've eaten.",

Great beer on tap including Kronenborg 1664! My second favorite beer! Food is okay, try the pecan and brie quesadilla and the daily soup! Service is normally quite good and they also feature great local musicians on the weekends, like Walt Richardson.  If you live on the lake, you can even dock your boat here! How cool is that?  There are new tables right down on the waters edge for that romantic date!  Give this place a try, you'll love it!",

Every time I come here there are other pooches and they all sniff each other out, it's great. Any place that allows furry friends on the patio gets my respect. So when I've been working a long day and don't want to leave Clover at home while I chill out, this is where I'll head.  The food is not mind blowing but it's good. I've had the salmon salad a few times, it's different and pretty good. In the winter they have a fire going, so it's lovely to sit next to it with a nice view of the water in front. It makes me feel like I'm not in Arizona, eating in a strip mall like is often the case.  I hosted a birthday dinner here for a friend and the owner was so great and helpful. She had me send people's food preferences ahead of time and things were ready to rock when we showed up. They had hot chocolate going to warm people up, had to have some baileys in mine, it was a great night. We were served so quickly and they did a great job remembering everyone's orders.  Great little hidden gem in Tempe, I want it to stay hidden though!",

    "text": "We went here for our 6 month anniversary and I have to say it could be a 3 star maybe higher depending on where you sit and who you get as a server. We sat downstairs to be close to the water and some of the tables and chairs had pigeon poop or similar on them (very appetizing). I got the lamb and my wife got the salmon. Here are some of the reasons they get a 2 star:   1) My wife and I don't drink soda, but the water was so nasty we had to order an apple juice and a diet soda just to have a drink. My wife's apple juice had floaty things in it and it made her really sick afterwords.  2) One of the waitresses accidentally set chips and salsa on our table (we thought it was something they give all their customers) and then our waitress saw her do it and came and grabbed the chips off our table and handed it to the table next to ours who ordered it.    3) A Lot of the customers seem like locals who go there all the time. We got treated as if we weren't customers and more like an inconvenience (not part of the \"in\" crowd). Our waitress visited our table only a few times very briefly and took forever in between trips. We waited over 15 minutes just to get the check.  4) The water where we were sitting had a bunch of filth and was turning my stomach. We ended up moving tables and that wasn't much better. The table was dirty and my wife got her brand new shirt dirty...there was an exposed socket right next to us and a bunch of local kids running around our table. (hindsight we should have sat up stairs - might have made it a 3 star).  5) The lamb had a bunch of fat on it.  6) The food was inconsistent, my wife had fries with her meal and she said they were the best fries she ever had so we ordered another side. The 2nd batch were gross and not even close to the first batch.   Although the ambiance wasn't there, here are the reasons they didn't get a 1 star:  1) My wife's salmon was good 2) The lamb was good (minus the fat)  3) french fries if you get a good batch are delicious!  4) cool that is by water in AZ and that you can ride a boat to the restaurant",

    "text": "My mom was in town, and wanted to see where a relative got married a few months back, so I showed her The Waterfront. Next door, she noticed a restaurant, Pier 54. She mentioned she'd like to try that out for lunch before she left. So we did.  Service: Bad. We arrived around 11:40, 40 minutes after they opened. We walked onto the patio/deck, and didn't see a server at all, so we just sat ourselves. After a good 15 minutes, a waiter walked out and took our drink order. Another 10 minutes, drinks arrived, and we decided to place our order then. We didn't receive our food for another 20 minutes or so. We didn't mind TOO much, since it was a nice day and we had a nice view of the man-made lake.  Food: I ordered the Fish & Chips and both were pretty good. Sadly, the fries were probably the best item we tasted. My Fiance had the regular burger & fries, and her burger was over-cooked and very dry and lacked flavor. My fish, was battered to perfection, although, the middle of the fish (most dense area), was cooked, but the consistency was different from the fish on the outer edges. Kinda mushy and not as appetizing. I enjoyed the ends and outer edges of the fillet of fish the most. My mom had the 1/2 sandwich & soup- roast beef panini & clam chowder. I took a bite of the panini, nothing special. Not gross, but not GREAT. its just ok. The clam chowder had a great flavor, but was awfully runny and thin and not as thick as most chowders. There wasn't many items: potatoes, clams, etc in there either. I was mostly a thin chowder broth.  In the end, I don't think we'll be back. Great location and nice atmosphere (minus the annoying bird that kept squawking all day long), but it was nice to enjoy the weather, the view and the ducks in the lake). I dont know why the service was soo slow, on a sunday, with only 3-4 tables. (more arrived as we left, but we were still shocked by the slow speed of the waiter). He was friendly, so I give him that, but we were really looking forward to this place, and it let us down quite a bit.  If you dont' mind slow service and can use a very laid-back atmosphere, then you'd like it. The food was passable, but nothing to drool over.",

That being said, we went here on St. Patrick's day and it was a little busy but not too bad, we got our seats right away and our waiter brought our drinks and menus out promptly. They had cheap drinks (I'm pregnant so I didn't get to enjoy them, but my friends absolutely loved them), and we were really enjoying ourselves.   After waiting about 20 minutes, we finally got our order in. The waiter seemed out of it, almost like he had had one too many Irish car bombs himself, because every time I spoke to him it took him way too long to respond. People that came long after we did got their food way before we even got our appetizers. When we got our entrees the burgers tasted charred and disgusting, it was a weird spicy taste that ruined the whole thing. The cheesecake was pretty good for desert and we loved the ambiance, but after the food..I will not go out of my way to go here again.",

Last time I was there, there was a musician setting up for live music. I personally avoid live music at all costs, but if you're into it this would be a fun spot. Out of the few times I've been here the service has been pretty average. I've only eaten here one time and i am hesitant to give them another chance. The fish sandwich I ordered was nearly inedible. My friends both ordered soup and said it was mediocre. But their draft beer selection is pretty good and they have my favorite, Hop Knot, so the bar gets my stamp of approval. The only draw back is that they don't stay open very late 10pm most nights, so its a happy hour or early evening location. All in all the ambiance and the bar are great, there's entertainment if you like live music, but this shouldn't be your destination if you are looking for a meal.",

The chairs were breaking, our server wasn't very attentive (drinks were never refilled) and the food was just OK. The fries were over seasoned and the chicken was dry, but the fish in the fish and chips was good. This place seems like a better place to go for a drink on a nice evening opposed to a meal.",

I also could never resist bringing friends there to have the s'mores kit. It's pretty nice being near water in Arizona while munching on some gooey marshmallow goodness.   I live in San Francisco now and really miss this place. Definitely on my list of places to hit for good food on my next Tempe visit!",

Everything I've had on their menu is delish and tasty. They have a nice appetizer selection including a great cheese board and panko crusted Brie.  I will continue to come here especially now that the weather is almost perfect. (It's outside seating). I've even come here in the summer and it's doable. Lol. They have sunscreens, misters  and fans.  There is usually live music on the weekends which makes for a great casual date night.  If you want a place to decompress from a long days work, this place has the cure!! Come and check it out.",

    "text": "This place is HORRIBLY overpriced! I ordered the chicken wings, and an idea of crab cakes. They come in an order of 8 for $12.50. Please explain to me how chicken wings suddenly became some kind of gourmet food. $12.50 for 8 wings is a joke. They were ok but very peppery. The crab cakes were very small and bland, and they only come 3 to an order for, you guessed it, $12.50. My waitress was pretty non-existent. I was there for a hour and she came by twice, that's it. When I finished I was handed the check. The total was over $34. WTF?!?! Turns out, my waitress added on another order of 4 wings for $6 because she said I ordered \"a dozen wings\"which was not what I ordered. I asked for an order of wings,  it a dozen. When I pointed it out she got an attitude and insisted I said a dozen. She feared to see if the manager would remove the order of 4. I really don't want to deal with it so I just gave her my credit card and said forget it.      I will not be coming back to Pier 54. The food is fair at best and tremendously overpriced. And the service is subpar. I will leave this place to the power drinkers, and the smokers at the bar. They can have it.",

    "text": "Are you like me, in that you like dining outside when the weather allows? Do you enjoy seeing a serene body of water in the middle of a desert? How about good food, great service, and maybe even some nice live music in the background? What about having a beverage  at a very relaxed  and casual patio bar? If so, then you will really like the experience that awaits you at Pier 54! Now, I have a small disclosure here. When I say dining outside, I literally mean outside, as there is no \"inside\" here. No kidding! This is a completely outdoor venue. BUT, there is plenty of cover overhead to provide shelter from the sun, (or occasional light shower, which seldom occurs in the Phoenix valley). In summer, there are misters and fans to help provide a measure of comfort, and in the winter there are patio heaters to take off the chill.  The menu offers a nice variety of delicious offerings, and there are also food specials and happy hour specials as well. One unique special I've never seen anywhere else is free wine. Yes, seriously, free wine. If you are a couple that is dining after 6pm and you spend $30 in food, you get a free bottle of house wine. And it's not like the food prices are expensive, so we have actually had to add an additional side or an appetizer in order to make the $30 threshold, but it definitely works! The live music I mentioned - that is on Thursday through Saturday evenings, and it usually consists of a solo or duet performance, with an occasional traditional 3-piece group mixed into the schedule. It's free, by the way - no cover charge. Finally, I have to address the fact that this really is a venue by the water, as it sits on the shore of a private lake with impressive private residences lining the opposing shores. You will likely see an occasional watercraft (quiet, trolling motors only) cruising by as you dine - extra bonus!  For those of you who have \"kids\" with 4 legs, this is also a dog friendly venue, with a lower deck of tables right by the water where you can dine with your furry friends! So yes, this has become one of my favorite venues to frequent. Check it out - you may thank me later!",

My wife had the Mahi Mahi  ceasar salad and I had the Mahi Mahi tacos with onion rings. I happen to like spicy foods so the tacos were good - However, If you do not like spicy hot, do not order these. The onion rings were good - they were fresh made and the breading was unique.

    "text": "I wanted to like this place so much! Went there for a dinner with friends on a Friday night, the place was busy but not packed. Our server brought us waters, and then we had to wait a half hour for menus after asking multiple times. We got the hummus as an appetizer and it only came with pita bread so we asked if we could have some veggies on the side since it was being shared by four people. We had to ask for the veggies again because the server forgot, and he still didn't bring them until we were halfway through with our entrees. We had to ask repeatedly for the server to refill our water glasses, and throughout our meal he didn't check on us at all. The food was average and was a little disappointing, certainly nothing to make up for the service. While the location was nice, the side we were on had smokers, and in a small place like that it was just really unpleasant. This place seems like it has potential, but they really need to train the staff better, we won't be back after the experience we had.",

They are dog friendly but be aware that there is no indoor seating, only outdoor. The upper patio is covered and has misters but I would be strategic as to when you visit to avoid the sweltering heat during the summer. Overall, I liked it and will be back with my dog!",

There's a disclaimer on their menu that the service is \"very relaxed\", but I would say that we were ignored for about 20 minutes before anyone came and gave us the time of day. After that, the service was pretty standard. I ordered the southwestern chicken sandwich with fries and I enjoyed my meal, everyone else seemed pretty \"meh\" about everything.   This would be a great place to enjoy a few drinks and the music and the view, but I probably wouldn't pick it out for dinner again.",

I used to live in the neighborhood,  and although it was usually a crowd that consisted of regulars, everyone has always been really friendly there. Lots of parking, and because it is a bar inside a neighborhood it is quiet and relaxing. The main reason to go to the bar is for a view at sunset. The bar overlooks a neighborhood lake, and people can actually travel by boat to the bar and dock right there. Calm, peaceful and friendly. They usually have someone playing live music on weekend nights and that can get pretty loud, so if you are looking for quiet on a weekend look elsewhere.",

    "text": "After reading some of the reviews my husband and I decided to have brunch here on a sunday. We thought wed try since most of the reviews were good. Well... we thought wrong. Please just dont go there and I really dont know how people are giving this place a good review...THIS PLACE SUCKS!  We got there and thought it was a nice chill place with outside tables and a nice view of the man made lake. We also though how lucky we got since we beat the morning rush. Then we noticed it'd been awhile since we've been standing there and still no one has asked us if we wanted a table. I stared at the asian guy at the bar and since he didnt say anything, I decided to knock on that little door assuming the kitchen then finally the asian guy says you can sit wherever you want.  Then came a little lady from downstairs to asked us for our drinks I swear 10 min later i mean she dissappeared then here comes the water and orange juice. The oj was nasty tasted like concentrated made for mixed drinks, t'was flat.   While this is happening the table next to us had complained about her food and she was just sitting there waiting. The server comes back after being gone for a long time and we placed our order and this time im really looking at the time cause damn i was getting hungry at this point. Then came a family of 4 with a baby. They sat and sat and no one has come. You could tell by their faces they were getting irritated. It has been 36 min from the time we orderd and we're still waiting for our food and the baby is crying now. As soon as i saw the server I told her to boxed our food cause we had to go and she said 'let me go and check to see if the food is done' I chuckled out loud thinking this rediculous. She comes back from the kitchen and says,  \"my manager says you guys can just go and you dont have to pay for the orange juice\" i laughed so hard and we walked out.  At the same time the family of 4 walked out with us I mean i dont know what else I could say to convince you not to go to this place. I just hope that you'd get a better experience than us if you go.  Sucks we waited all that time and didnt have a chance to try some of the \"good food\" they supposedly have that  people had written on here about.",

Beer is always good, and they have a decent selection - they need more local stuff though. The dip was solid, as were the chips and other dipping bits.   For dinner I had the bowtie pasta - needed a little bit more salt, but otherwise it was delicious!  I didn't get the bread that I was supposed to though :( My honey had a burger, and said that it was pretty good.   Overall, it's a lovely place with solid food.

If you are looking for a place to take your time, have some drinks, enjoy a 'man made' lake, with a local feel, then this is your place.    As a bonus, their food is really good!  More to choose from than just 'bar food' and everything has a unique twist to it.  I hope to see some local ingredients and all natural/anti-biotic free type proteins in the future.  A couple times we received some pretty poor service, which is saying a lot since every time we go there with a 'no rush, take our time' mindset.  But mostly it is just fantastic all around!",

A few tables surround a large open bar, all with a view of the smallish man-made lake that sits inside an upscale housing development. As we ate, we watched a beautiful sunset over the lake, and also saw a few homeowners guide their boats up to the restaurant's small dock.  Everything was delicious, from the hot crab and artichoke dip through the entrees to the dessert. I like to try something new, so I ordered salmon tacos with mango salsa and chipotle mayo, My husband is more traditional, so he had the Torpedo -- a man-sized prime rib sandwich with plenty of tender meat. I was tempted by the brie quesdadilla with candied walnuts, and my husband wants to go back for the Southwest pizza.  And for dessert? Get this -- they bring a hibachi to your table so that you can roast marshmallows, dip them in a pot of melted chocolate, then roll them in graham cracker crumbs! Unfortunately, we didn't have time for that luxurious experience as we were on our way to an event, so we got the New York cheesecake with berries to go.  Around the bar, the crowd was young, with some middle-aged people, and a couple of seniors. But they all were having fun, which made the mood of this small place happy and lively.  The place is owned by a husband/wife catering team, so the menu may change with the seasons.",

    "text": "We have been in Arizona for 3 days now and each day have stopped here at least for an appetizer.  Twice for meals.  The service has always been timely, efficient and friendly.  It's self seating with a few exceptions of crowded nights.  It is all outdoor seating with a smoking section and some bar seating.  There was a live band last night, Thursday.  She was amazing.   The food has been fantastic every time.  The owners have only had this place for a few years and have been striving to change the image from fast and greasy to relaxed and offer fresh healthier alternatives.  They hand pick their vegetables.  They cut their own French fries.  We got the garlic fries one night.  It was amazing.  Big enough chunks of fresh garlic to offer a little heat.  It may not be what you're use to.  They're not twice fried, like McDonald's.  We had the ahi tuna steak with mixed vegetables.  The glaze was perfect.  A reduction of soy and garlic and not sure what else.  The steak was big enough for my husband and I to share.  Comes on the rare side unless you specify otherwise.  But that is how we like it.  Fresh vegetables were organic cauliflower, green beans, yellow squash and red peppers lightly sauteed so that they were still crispy.  Perfect!     They have a small kitchen.  So if you have time restraints talk to your server and they'll tell you what can be done quickly.  They always have something fun going on.  Happy hour every day (I think) from 3-6.  They had a raffle there one night this week for a free hair appt, pedicure and massage.  And everyone is right.  You can't be the view!     This is a place to relax, catch up with friends and not be forced to eat the same ole bar food that we have all grown tired of.  Light up a cigar.  Laugh and talk.  Life is too short not to enjoy it",

    "text": "A True Romanian food experience.  We, a party of 6, went to Pier 54 last night for dinner, drinks and to be entertained by the live band. We entered the patio, saw a sign \"please seat yourself\" but we were greeted by a staff member and asked how many. I said 6. We walked around the bar and I asked if they could push 2 tables together to accommodate our group? The host said I will have to ask the manager. A minute later he said he will put the tables together.     The waiter was attentive. He took our drink order. Served our drinks and took our dinner order in a timely matter. The food was good. The band started as dessert was ordered. The bill was paid. We were enjoying the band while one of the couples was finishing there wine.     This is where it gets strange........ The restaurant started to get busy. 3 patrons sat at the bar right behind my chair. A server tried to pass between myself and the bar stool. She bumped into my chair, spilling my water on me, and with attitude said \" You need to keep the aisle clear\" There was no apology or offer to rearrange our seating. Ten minutes later  the owner, CHRISTINA GEORGESCU, walked up behind me, started to push my chair and telling me \" I can not block the aisle\" I got up and left. Outside the patio there was a line to be seated.    Why do I think CHRISTINA GEORGESCU did this? She thinks after the bill is paid she can be rude to her guests to make room for her next victims.   CHRISTINA GEORGESCU, running a restaurant is not just making food but also includes service. My advice to you is to listen to a song my grandmother used to sing.  The M-o facut mama Oltean song.  \"Cin' se ia cu mine bine, ii dau haina de pe mine, Cin' se ia cu mine rau, sa-l fereasca Dumnezeu, Ca sunt arpe de Dudau, de-l galben ce muca rau\"",

The service was 3 of 5 as our server was attentive but maybe having a bad day and a little cold or not so excited to be at work today! I ordered a burger medium rare and my friend order the chicken skewers with a side salad. The food took about 35 mins to get to us which I have no problem with but considering there were about 10 people at the restaurant, I feel like it could have been quicker. Also my burger was well down and actually a little burnt. My friend also mentioned his food, \"lacks flavor\"   All in all this place has a ton of potential if they can work on the menu and add more flavor to the foods because the location/atmosphere is great on a beautiful day in AZ!!",

But, it is an outdoor restaurant so you get what you get. Being right on the water is a plus. I've seen a few boat rides and at least two weddings at the pier in the middle of the lake. This place is super romantic when the weather permits. The staff is always super friendly and they usually have a good crowd.

    "text": "Visiting from out of town and was looking for a restaurant with outdoor seating but not crazy expensive, so decided on Pier 54. They don't take reservations unless for 6+ people so it's first come first served.  The entire place is outside, which is a big plus for me as it isn't easy to find cool places outdoors in America. When we first arrived, we were guided to a table in the back, but I spotted a waterfront one that hadn't been cleared yet.  When I asked if we could be seated there, the friendly waiter said no problem and went to clear it real quick.  While I was super happy to get the table for a nice sunset view, I wish someone would have informed me it came with a waitress with something stuck up her ass. I see what people mean when saying this place has potential but doesn't quite meet the standards.  Some examples of our crappy service: No small talk, no asking if we wanted new drinks or refills, didn't inform us of unavailable dishes, didn't clear our table (not even when bringing dessert), didn't ask if we enjoyed our meal, didn't ask if we wanted dessert. We really felt like she had something against us and couldn't be bothered making the evening a fun experience.   The food itself was good, but with bad service it does taste a bit bitter. Luckily the sunset was gorgeous and March Madness was on TV, so we were entertained throughout the night. However, I was envious of the tables that had the fun dude for a waiter..",

I still give it a 4 star for the what it is: A casual outdoor place that you can go and relax. Def not a place to go if you are in a hurry. Points too- they have music on the weekends at night and I have not heard a bad band there! Side menu note- all my friends rave about the fish and chips. Give it a try!   When you want a cool outdoor patio on the water go visit Pier 54. It is a great gem in the desert!",

It's teeny tiny and completely outdoors so big parties are not something I would recommend, but the atmosphere is fun, funky, and gorgeous during sunset looking out over the lake.  The food options during happy hour are minimal and still fairly expensive for what you get but it is very good.  My favorite food was the fried Brussels and cauliflower.  They were perfectly cooked and had the perfect amount of the tangy spicy sauce.  The beer selection is small-ish and drinks are a touch overpriced but I will give them credit... good pours!  The service is pretty good but a little forgetful. We had a person in our party who needed to leave and we had to ask for our bill a few times.  Overall good but with the potential to be great.",

Of course they had a special for corned beef and cabbage on that particular day, but they have regular breakfast/brunch options as well. I don't think it was staffed well, as the bartender was taking care of the whole patio. It wasn't too popular. After sitting there for a couple of hours, I could see why. They ran out of popular beer choices, the staff was stretched thin and it took a while to get food and drink - even at the lovely outdoor patio. While the environment would get more stars, the food and service take it down a notch. They shouldn't rely on the environment to bring people in so much. I'm not sure I'd go back.",

    "text": "Looking through all the 5 star reviews for this place, I've begun to realize that most of these people probably think McDonald's is 5 stars...  I recently moved into the neighborhood and have been anxious about trying this place due to the bi-polar nature of the reviews (either 1-2 star or 5 star) and the fact that, after living in Tempe for over a decade, no one has recommended, let alone even mentioned this place to me.  After visiting yesterday, it has all become clear to me.  This place should change it's name from Pier 54 to Pure Diarrhea.  First of all, let me get the positives out of the way. The spot itself is cool, with a great view of the lake and good sized bar, and since it's outside, it's one of the few bars you can smoke at if you're into that. They also had an ok tap. Not that many selections, but they had church music from the shop, Odell IPA, and some other reasonable mainstream craft... This got them the extra star solely.  The bad: Someone needs to clean this place. I know it's outside, but once my family and I sat ourselves, I started looking around and the dishevelment became apparent. Fans had think layers of crusted dust on them, sweeping seemed to be an after thought, menus were dirty and water warped, canopy was all out of wack, layers of dust all over anything attached to the metal ceiling part... Just gross. I swear I could hear Gordon Ramsey in my head saying \"fucking disgraceful\".  The service was spotty. At first, it took 10 minutes to get anyone's attention, and they just dropped off a menu and dipped before I could order a beer. Another 10 minutes and I got my beer order in.  Eventually more servers showed up (like 4 more) and things got a little better, but just a little... Don't know if it was right in the middle of a shift change, but even when fully staffed my second beer was forgotten but then remembered after the server brought our food out.   The ugly: The food. Terrible is an understatement, and on top of that it's expensive. Everything on the menu is $3-$4 more than it should be:  $12.50 for 8 disgusting wings that made me nearly ruin my pants later on that evening... Here's some perspective on other places that are actually good: Four peaks, $12 for 10 and they're amazing Teakwoods, $12.99 for 12 and they're bomb  $12.50 for a lackluster hummus plate with 1 pita and celery and carrots. The hummus was definitely store bought or purchased premade through their distributor, because of this, this was honestly the best thing we had.  $12.50 for 4 soggy ass chicken strips. This had promise, but the execution was botched completely. Oil must have been under temp because these were floppy and wet. They weren't dredged properly, so the batter just slid off.  We didn't order one, but they want $14.50 for a burger. This has to be one of the most expensive burgers in Tempe, and I would bet money it's also one of the worst.  At the top of every page is their menu they have a message (this is verbatim): \"Great food takes time to prepare, and we are very serious about our food!  Please check with your server prior to ordering, if you have time constraints. Thanks for understanding.\"  First of all, cough cough bullshit cough cough.  Extra comma and unneeded capital letter aside, poor grammar gives me great pause when on menus, this really just reads to me like, \"we know our kitchen sucks, is mad inefficient, and have received a lot of complaints about it as well as our slow service, so instead of fixing the problem, we're just going to put this message on top of every page of the menu\".  I could not have been more disappointed with the food here. The absolute worst food experience I have had in 2018, and the worst $60  I've wasted as well.   I still may come by and grab a beer at the bar and stare at the lake ever so often just due to the close proximity of this joint to my house, but that's it.  Bottom line: if you're hungry, run as fast as you can away from this place.",

We walked directly next door to The Watershed  and had a phenomenal dining experience. The Watershed had great service, delicious food and better happy hour deals than  pier 54. I would definitely recommend The Watershed over pier 54.  Later, I emailed the manager and told her what happened and her response was that the bartender was confused but I felt it was too little, too late and, therefore, I am keeping my original rating of 1 star.",

They serve the stuff that is left over in your pantry/fridge but don't want to make so you decide to go out instead.  For example they use canned salmon on top of their \"salmon salad\".  I mean how hard is grilling a piece of frozen salmon?  Their \"salmon tacos\" are the same thing.  Their menu is all over the map and needs to be cut down by 50%.  Its just a bunch of random bar food.  They should choose just a few things and do them well.  Not 40 things microwaved poorly.  Don't even get me started on their ice.  It makes their drinks disgusting.  I'm almost positive it is lake water.  Our server was nice but a complete clusterfuk.  It took 15 minutes to get dressing for a salad.  Not more dressing, just dressing period because they just forgot to put it on.  I will eat and drink almost anything anywhere but I have to draw the line somewhere.",

    "text": "How the hell did I end up in San Diego?? I was just on the 60!  I was so pumped about Pier 54 that I could barely eat, even though the food was pretty darn good.  Built along the edge of those zig-zaggy man-made lakes in the middle of Tempe, Pier 54 is tucked away from any traffic noise and the hustle and bustle of sprawling Phoenix life.  It's set up as a bar / restaurant combination, with a bar in the middle and seating all around it.  The bar has a couple of TV's mounted (old school non-flat screens!) so you can catch the Suns or the other teams that let Phoenicians down.  The food was good; I wouldn't send an email back home about it but definitely didn't detract from the experience.  I had the Shamu which was a battered cod sandwich.  It was pretty good and although the bun would have left a little to wish for, they toasted it which immediately adds some points - sneaky.  The fries were seasoned and came out hot.  Add the fact that even though we showed up five minutes before their last call takes place at 9:30p, the staff was really friendly and helpful.  They only had two beers on tap, but as previously mentioned one was the Kronenbourg 1664 which is one of my new favorites.  All in all, two sandwiches and a couple beers set us back about $25 bucks.  Not bad considering the area and view.  I'll definitely be returning for both Happy Hour and dinner in the future.",

Basically go here for the music and ambience and maybe a mixed drink.",

    "text": "THIS IS LONG BUT WORTH IT. I've worked in the restaurant industry (Full Time) for the past 8 years now. Most bad reviews are hard for me to take seriously because usually the review is written by someone who hasn't worked in a restaurant. So I had to point that out before I begin so everyone reading this has a better sense of validating the truth to this review as it comes from the perspective of someone with an extensive back round in restaurants.  So here is my family's experience we went through yesterday at Pier 54 on Easter Sunday. Let me also point out that my family has been regular customers there literally for 20 years!  My Mom called in advance and made a 12:30pm reservation for 10 people at Pier 54 on Easter Sunday. Everyone places there order at 12:45 with the waitress. At around 1:50pm give or take a couple minutes, my dad asks waitress if our food is coming and she says,\"yeah I know it's taking a while but one of the ovens is broken.\" It's been an hour still  with no food, and she now tells us this about the oven? Is that real? At this point I look around the restaurant and I see some lady customer get up from her table, walks over to a waitress and screams at her saying she's walking out because her family too was still waiting for their food after over an hour. Within 15 minutes like a trickle effect I watch 3 more tables walk out haven't even gotten their food yet either.  I now look over  to see what the owner is doing. (Like I said my family is regulars so we know exactly who the owners are.)  I am not even making this up I watched the owner get in her car and drive away as she can see plainly her restaurant and staff in disaster mode, and even worse an entire restaurant of upset customers walking out whose Easter was now ruined, and not even a sense of decency on her own to come over to every table and try to remedy the situation. I too work in a restaurant so waiting for food is understandable especially on a busy holiday, so we weren't even upset about the wait, but just the fact that not even a manager after all this time had even yet come over to apologize let alone the owner herself who left when her restaurant needed her most.  Just before 2:15pm (an hour and a half after placing the order) 5 orders come out, but 5 of us still have no food. 20 minutes later the other 5 orders come out.  So it's close to 2:45pm, (2 hours after the order was placed) and finally everyone has their food. Now the fact that most of the food was cold was one thing, but if any Chef that I've worked with would've seen the lack of quality of the food they served us on those plates, they would've shut down that kitchen themselves.   Most of our table now leaves to find another place to eat. Im fed up and finally get up and ask the bartender who the manager was and he said he was. I explained to him what was going on, he apologized profusely and said our entire bill would be taken care of. Our waitress even comes back right after that apologizing, saying how terrible she feels that our Easter is ruined and and tells us we don't even have to wait for a bill because of what happened. So even though we had a bad experience at least the manager and server did something to try and fix it.  The owner finally comes back in her car, which now the restaurant is cleared out. I walk up to her and have a great talk with her for 15 minutes about our experience, and about what went wrong, etc. She follows me back to the table where the rest of us were and she even apologizes in TEARS, saying how terrible she feels, and how sorry she is. My dad assures her everything is fine and that hed still always come back and bring others like he has been doing for 20 years.  We finally are leaving and I kid you not, the owner comes back with a bill for an $80 drink tab, saying shed take care of our food but we had to pay the drinks because its against the law to take care of our drinks. Giving away free alcohol vs having to COMP drinks are 2 different things she just didnt want to pay for the bill even after her fault for ruining our Easter. That showed us right there the person she was. I brought over the bar manager who earlier told me our bill was taken care of and I ask him right in front of the owner's face, \"did you tell us our entire bill would be taken care of,\" and he replied, \"yes I did say that.\" The owner then says, \"oh he doesn't know the rules, he was mistaken.\" She then tells us to pay the bill and that also we werent ever welcome back. At this point yes my dad did lose it and started cursing, which how can you blame after going through the worst restaurant experience ever in his life and then still being asked to pay $80 and being kicked out? THE BEST PART..As we were walking away I stepped to grab my keys on the table, the owner picks them up and throws them over the fence. Pier 54 in all my life I have never seen so many upset tables at once and for that you are by far the worst restaurant ive ever been to.",

This place should be shut down because of the flies and mosquitos swarming the dining area. Not only were the flies an utter nuisance, but our waitress and all of the staff were acting as if nothing was happening. Service was bad. We got our food to go after protecting an appetizer from the bugs. I regret that. This was a $50 meal for two with no alcohol. We could have gone to Flemmings with that kind of tab. The food we opened when we got home was anything but good. My boyfriends burger was burnt to hell after ordering medium rare, and my ahi tuna was overcooked at on a low temp causing a pink inner and stiff steak. Pilaf was good until I thought about how the flies could have easily flown into the kitchen and blended with the rice. I FEEL ROBBED.  Do not attend!!!",

With that being said I asked to reserve a table for 10 people and was shown that we'd be sitting right by the lake in a quite corner. Got there for my 7:30 reservation and we literally had to use the flashlights on our phones to read the menu. Extremely dark and being so close to the water probably not very safe.  We rarely saw our waitress who was either new or just didn't care much to help our table.  My boyfriend being a vegetarian asked to order a pizza off the menu but was told because he wasn't a child we couldn't order it. He ended up just ordering fries but our waitress was not helpful at all and offered to bring him a hamburger bun with lettuce and condiments in a laughing tone. I wanted to ask for a to go box for my food but seeing as our waitress was nowhere to be found we just wanted to hurry and leave.  To top it off we waited at least 20 minutes for her to bring us our bill after we asked for it and the restaurant automatically had a 20% tip included. I also work in the service industry so I understand the importance of tipping but our waitress did NOT deserve the amount of tip she got from my party of 10.  I'm sure if you sit by the bar and don't expect much for service this place would be just fine. Like I said their drinks were good but the service was awful.",

I have traveled the world for 30 years  professionally and personally and  am amazed with the value and overall experience of the quaint \"San Diego\" like experience.  They accommodate every dietary request, we are a low carb family, with a smile and the meals are fabulous.  The vista is breathe taking and casual at the same time.  Please visit and enjoy!!  Why did I take the time to comment? I observed the most tragic \"lack of parenting\" phenomenon. I personally observed a family unit represent the worst in American entitlement culture .  The was an apparent  disconnect in expectations.  I support addressing them and I personally do but the manner was unacceptable!!!  The customers dropped F-bombs and where out of bounds of appropriate behavior in the background of Easter.  The owner comp'd them the meal and the family still retaliated on YELP. Really, this is a first class establishment and deserves 5 stars and if it dips based on a server mistake address it professionally with the owners and it will be resolved to your satisfaction.    Please give this restaurant (Pier 54) a chance and you won't regret it!!    I will sign my name and list my email if you doubt my conviction!!

When we sat down, we were told that the kitchen was backed up because of a large party who just placed their order...but turns out never got food before closing their tabs! Suspect it was just an excuse for the horrible service we were about to get.  We ordered the meat platter, BLT, and Italiana Salad. The appetizer came out minutes before the main course and was completely underwhelming. Salad greens were wilted and the bacon on the BLT was the only standout. Everything else was bland and mediocre.  We waited an hour for our food and another hour for the bill. And while we waited we saw several parties sit down but change their minds before getting service and others were in the same boat as us - just waiting. Luckily the other servers stepped in to help our otherwise slammed server. I've never been so tempted to warn people walking in to turn around and cut their losses!  Bottom line - Pier 54 boasts a great location by the lake but the food and service leave something to be desired.",

I'm sorry but GROSS.  The server was very nice (and the only reason to give 2 stars) but the food was just hideous.  Everything was overcooked...to the point of being hard as a rock.  The patio itself is dirty and overrun with weeds and such.  Again we couldn't really enjoy the view because all of the smokers were at and/or near the bar where the view is.  I won't be back.",

A couple people in our group had eaten here before and they said the food was bad then but they were giving it a second chance and yet again the food was another big disappointment.  They had big cooling fans blowing on our table and when the band played the section we were sitting lost power so we had to finish in the dark and sweating our asses off cuz the blowers went out.   If its winter & you want to have a drink by the \"lake\" then yeah I'd suggest this place, but don't waste your money if you want food.",

No misters operating but a huge movable swamp cooler was doing some good. We didn't stay long enough to eat.

They refused to comp the entree and tried to make it up with free desserts that no one wanted. We ask for a manager and someone came over that was clearly not the manager and said \"you ate it sorry nothing we can do for you\" . Ridiculous!!!! It was a wrong order made by the kitchen and the proper order came out 15 minutes later.   Save your money don't go here. Or go here if you want a garbage dining experience. Good luck",

You would think that you would staff up vs penalize your customers for wanting to come spend the holiday at your place. Not everyone is a fan of pork and 20 versions of eggs Benedict. Big fail, we almost left but she served me my beer before we could cancel the order.  A little shocked to seeing family and children being sat in the smoking section while the nonsmoking section goes vacant.   Our free entertainment was the 2 man group and the elderly man with his fingers in his ears. We would have bought him a beer or joined him if he didn't leave.   This is one of my favorite places to come and I am super disappointed with the Easter disaster. Food was bland and came out under cooked twice. Two stars for today.. waiting for another mind blowing experience so I can update my review.",

After not being greeted 10 minutes after seating ourselves , we cut our second trip short because we were not willing to endure horrendous service again.

I am hosting a very casual 40th birthday for my husband with drinks and food if people want it.  I called Pier 54 on Wednesday to get the reservation going.  They said I couldn't talk to anyone and needed to go through the website.  I emailed them my request.  Called the next day and asked to get a response from my email.  The manager Cristina called me back and was initially working with me to get this to work.  She said she would hold the area with the projector for me and said she had emailed me the list of food options.  I asked her to tell me what was in the email so we could just do everything over the phone.  She said no, check your junk box.  So I looked at the email and emailed her back promptly my choice of food and how to make the deposit.  I got no response.  Called her on Friday and she said I'm sorry one of our regulars called just now and reserved that area so we aren't going to be able to accommodate you.  I let her know my frustrations as I have been trying to get this done since Wednesday and everyone refused to talk over the phone.  She said there was too much back and forth with you and these people called and placed the deposit immediately.  Wait...I was told I couldn't do that and had to do everything over email???  She said this happened because this was a regular.  WHAT!!!  I said this is horrific and I have never been treated this way.  I said I have never been to your restaurant  and was bringing 20 people whom haven't either.  She said it's probably best on your end and my end that we don't meet!!!  So, now I have to figure out where to do this in 24 hours!  WORST OWNER/MANGER EVER!!!!",

When the manager of the other restaurant showed up, she showed the owner that she was giving us cash and we could order whatever we wanted. Instead the owner of Pier 54 said she didn't want anyone's cash. At that point we did not feel comfortable staying there and the original restaurant, The Watershed, invited us to come back over and have lunch on them plus a free cruise of the lake.

They occasionally have live music which can be good and bad as it sometimes is a bit too loud for the small space and well it doesn't exactly pull in top talent however still just a great neighborhood joint to grab some food and a beer.
