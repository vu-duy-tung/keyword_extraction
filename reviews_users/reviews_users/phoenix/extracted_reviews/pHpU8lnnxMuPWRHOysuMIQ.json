The menu is very creative, it has things (for brunch) such as \"cinnamon toast crunch chicken and waffles\" and \"hummus nachos\". After trying about half the menu i'm pretty much at the conclusion that everything is really good.  The bar staff is excellent. Brandon and Iuila have been fantastic in recommending foods and drinks.  If anything, make sure you drop by for brunch. They do penny mimosas ($18 all you can drink) and live music on Sundays. Overall awesome experience.",

Service was GREAT but something was really off last night; perhaps it was the cook that night.   Me: Chicken panini with Salut fries. Too much oil was used in grilling it, because it came out greasy, leaving an oily residue on my fingers. Fries were good, but I liked the way they used to serve it with the crumbled feta not shaved/dry feta.   Guest: Malbec burger with regular fries. Ground meat used for burger had chewy nerve endings and her fries were too salty to eat.   I'm just disappointed. Our meals certainly weren't worth what we spent on them. After this experience, I don't think I'll be back. Maybe this is a sign of things to come for this restaurant.",

The drink menu isn't super easy to follow and the beers don't even describe what style the beer is. For instance, Magic Hat was listed as a beer, but that's just a beer company with different beers. Also, they have several five dollar drink specials, but no $5 wines.  Since it's a wine bar, it would be nice to have a cheap wine option instead of a vodka red bull.    We had a bruschetta with apples, prosciutto, and goat cheese, along with some other stuff. Bread wasn't crisp and the ingredients were kinda boring. Would have been nice to see them chopped and mixed together instead of just being laid on top like an open face sandwich.  We got two salads. Girlfriends, bacon Caesar had a ridiculous amount of celery. It was pretty much a celery salad. My Cobb was good but the chicken wasn't cut into small enough pieces to eat.  I guess I should have cut up the entire salad cuz the spinach pieces were huge too. My mouth is gigantic and it was hard to eat. Good flavor though.  Prices were reasonable and service was good.  Sucks that it's a one person bathroom.",

I enjoy the food, the selection of wine and beer.. but mostly I do enjoy the service.   I started off by trying the Odell 90 Shilling Ale from Colorado, which I might have had before but I enjoyed it. After mingled a while with an empty glass I wanted to try the pumpkin ale they have, but they ran out. Instead I tried a strange beer with a name like magic hat - the awesome transylvanian behind the counter wanted me to go for a super hopy number, but I wouldn't let myself be persuaded.    After Happy Hour I was, however, talked in to stay for dinner.. and I had the Chicken Panini, and also a half of the Brie Hive (so good) with the greek fries. Very tasty I must say.   This was my third visit, and I am still just as pleased with this place. The food is good, but the service is personable and knowledgeable, and the ambiance intimate and mellow, and these are the True selling points here.",

Overall, I would definitely come back, but even if the food wasn't as good, the staff is enough to make me want to come back, everyone greeted me, and continually stopped in the make sure I was doing okay.

First of all, the decor is done with recycled components, mixing old and new, makes for a very beautiful setting. The minute you walk in you can feel the friendliness of the staff. Salut is perfect for lunch with your friends or a hot date. :) The food is inventive and delicious and the wine/cocktails are amazing. If you haven't checked this gem out you must! I can't wait to go back!",

I do feel as though the pricing is a little on the high side, but the food we had (burgers) was quite delicious. We also had the s'more which was overpriced $10 for a few pieces of Hershey's chocolate and graham crackers. The presentation was nice but not worth the $10. I thought there could've at least been some better chocolate for the price.",

It was important for me to find a space where my family and friends could hang out comfortably, and Salut exceeded all expectations of the entire afternoon. We called a week in advance to reserve a table for 28 on their patio. I was nervous the wait staff might not be able to split up multiple checks so we confirmed this wouldn't be a problem over the phone. Upon arrival, they had cute little flowers in jars as centerpieces and the 2 waiters assigned to our table were SO great. They were extremely attentive and patient with such a large group.   Also, they have bottomless mimosas. Overall I would absolutely recommend the patio for a large group.",

We got appetizers AFTER entrees, and all we heard about these constant mixups and screws ups were excuses...\"ohh, the drink mix must've been out\", or \"ohh I'm sorry we didn't get that yet.\" But the best line we heard from our server about our MARGARITAS not showing up when we ordered them was \"ohh we had to make a new mixture of vodka stuff\", interesting, seeing as how a margarita is made with TEQUILA and not VODKA, but hey, who am I to question such things? Don't lie to guests, just make it right.   This place is so overstaffed with lingering staff doing nothing it's amazing that anything went wrong. With that many people around doing absolutely nothing you'd think it'd be smooth and our orders would come out right, but nope, orders came out at odd times, drinks were wrong, things were forgotten, and the service experience overall was a mess. Really crumby performance, sorry guys, it was weak. Tell your waitstaff that they have a job to do and doing it right matters, otherwise people get rubbed the wrong way.

For drinks I got a Mojito. It was ok. I've been drinking all day so I wanted something on the lighter side. For food we got the sampler which comes with the hummus nachos, caprese salad, salut fries, and prosciutto wrapped melon. The hummus nachos were amazinggggg!!! I wanted to keep getting more! There were three of us so it didn't fill us enough so we ended up also ordering the Paquillo Ravioli with shrimp. I really loved the sauce that they had on this. I thought that the entree was a bit small, especially for $17.   The service was really great here. The place has only been open for about a year but everyone was really friendly and accommodating. When we ordered the pasta they forgot the shrimp so they brought it out on the side after and took it off our bill. At the end, they forgot to bring us our check so my friend went to the bar to ask them for it. The manager came over and apologized and ended up giving us free shots to make up for it! Wow. I don't know about you guys but I don't know a restaurant that would give you free shots for that. I eventually want to come back to try their brunch and they also have bottomless mimosas on Sunday! I'll definitely be back for happy hour or brunch soon. Not to mention the workers are not bad to look at.FYI ladies.. =P",

However, nothing really special about the dish.  Re-order: NO  -Dish 2 Review: SALUT BURGER -- $11.00 --   3.0/5 stars The Burger was good but nothing special about it. For this price, I would expected special recipe but I could not taste it.  Re-order: NO  -Comparison with other restaurant: Salut Kitchen Bar Vs. Four Peaks Brewing Co  If you want to drink and have a good food, I would suggest Four Peaks Brewing Co. Salut Kitchen Bar has good view and food, too. However, I was not satisfy with that price for that food. Definitely, Salut Kitchen Bar is a good place to date and hang out with friends.",

I arrived as soon as they received their food. Not a big deal, thinking I could order soon and possibly enjoy a mimosa while I waited. Waitress didn't come back to offer me water or a menu, and I ended up sharing some of my friends water. We assumed she would return shortly to ask about the food or top off waters or any of the half full Mimosas. Nope. About 25-35 minutes goes by. My friends finish up their food and she finally comes by saying she had not seen me in a joking matter. I'm not super amused at this point, especially because it was pretty empty and had she had done the basics she could have had another customer. We resorted to closing out and moving to another place.",

I am glad that I did since it was excellent. Even with the dressing on the side this salad was outstanding, very flavorful, and down right yummy.   Tyler, our waiter, was not only funny, sweet and caring he was very attentive to our table and the ones around us. I normally have to bug the waiter or waitress for water refills but not Tyler... He was on top of everything making sure we were well cared for. He also when the extra mile to interact with us and make us feel at home...   I will be back again as everything from the food, the location and the staff is well worth the drive from the other side of the valley. Hopefully, next time I am in he will be my waiter again.   Thanks Salut and Tyler!",

    "text": "(Cross-posted and slightly edited Facebook review; people need to know how great this place is!)  I've been here so often that I think it's time to write a proper review!  I've been a loyal customer of Oliveo Grill ever since I moved here in 2008. Being a night owl, I have ordered many a hummus starter or gyro platter to my door at 2AM many times. One night when I was picking up a to-go order, I saw a flier for their new restaurant, Salut Kitchen Bar. It advertised penny refills on mimosas, so naturally I filed it away in my brain. Then, some friends from out of town flew into Phoenix, and I knew just where to take them for brunch. It was phenomenal! From the food to the cocktails to the impeccable service, it was truly a brunch to remember.   I proceeded to come back for booze and yummy food even after that memorable brunch. And every single time, I've been met with both great service and fantastic food/drink. The hummus nachos are so good they should be illegal, their craft cocktails are delicious (especially the Lavender Lemon Fizz, OMG!), their beer list is fantastic, and basically everything else on the menu is yummy. Not only that, but the owners, managers, and bartenders have all personally introduced themselves to me and remembered me when I come in. Whenever I come by for a visit, there's always wonderful music playing - live music on Wednesday nights! - wine flowing, and wonderful people to visit with.   I can't tell you how happy I am to see this fantastic place thrive. It's by far my favorite place in Tempe.  My favorite menu items: Hummus nachos, Quinoa fritters, Quinoa bowl, Caprese salad, Malbec burger, hummus-stuffed avocado. Favorite cocktails/general booze: Lavender Lemon Fizz, Dirty Gin Martini, basically any of their Mules, and the House Pinot Grigio. I sampled one of their Absinthes tonight and that was great, too.",

He was fun to chat with, wasn't overbearing, but always there for refill our waters and make sure everything was good.   It took a little while for the food to come out, but we were enjoying the weather and our bottle of wine. We ordered hummus nachos & bruschetta to start.

What I don't like is the deceptive groupon:  \"$32 for dinner for two (up to $59 total value)      Two craft cocktails     Two gourmet burgers or hot sandwiches with choice of Salut fries or greek salad\"  We ordered two cocktails $9 and $10 a piece, we ordered 2 paninis, one with the \"Salut\" fries\", $10 and $9 each. Plus an extra $1.50 for the unknown upgrade to Salut Fries (server didn't mention this or that the groupon would only cover the cheapest sandwich and cheapest drink option)  Being good grouponers we ordered extra: hummus nachos as a starter and an additional beer.  When it came time to pay we got $32.50 off our bill because of the groupon.  This is deceptive because wasn't my groupon for \"$32 for dinner for two (up to $59 total value)      Two craft cocktails     Two gourmet burgers or hot sandwiches with choice of Salut fries or greek salad\"  ??  *note that Salut fries are mentioned on the groupon!  I really liked the place. The hummus nachos were amazing and I'd like to go back. But this was just shady.  **also note the photo of their hummus nachos shows 6 triangles, we only received 5.

    "text": "Salut is in an entirely unassuming part of Tempe, but it's a happy surprise! Once inside this little restaurant in a newer strip mall, it's a delightful eatery filled with character and personality. Once inside, you'd never know what was around you on the outside. The atmosphere is intimate and charming with dark wooden and metal features, dining table spread throughout the restaurant and a large bar taking up a lot of the space. They also have a small patio that is dog friendly!  First off, the happy hour here is amazing. They do $5 bottles of house wine and you don't even have to open it there. You could just simply take it home with you!   I recently dined here before seeing a show at ASU Gammage and found it to be a perfect restaurant before a show. It's just east of Rural on University but only about a 5-7 minute drive to the theater. My friend and I shared the bruschetta and the corn and goat cheese salad. You get to choose four bruschettas for $12 and each one is cut into two. The salad was on the smaller side. After eating the meal, I think we could have gotten one more item to share in order to leave completely full, but the food was excellent! I think I could have easily enjoyed the order of bruschetta to myself. We got four different kinds: Chicken & Hummus, Wild Mushroom, Fig, and Prosciutto with Apple. I really enjoyed all three but my two favorites were the Fig and Proscuitto. The bread was very soft and delicious.   The salad was flavorful complete with corn, goat cheese, chicken and avocado. It was a delicious salad but I wouldn't suggest splitting it if you're really hungry. Save it for yourself!   The food, environment and price was all very delightful and I will definitely return again for another visit!",

    "text": "This was another place that my friends have brought me! It's always good to have friends who know the area, have tried it already, and want to share good places with you!   To be honest, we came here for the drinks but they have some awesome food too!   We'll start with the food....  There were three of us and we got different things and shared it all. So we ended up getting the hummus nachos (I'm told it was something thy're known for?), it came out in pita triangles, with a mix of hummus, red onions, pomegranate seeds, balsamic reduction, and feta cheese. I gotta say though between the pomegranate and balsamic reduction it was sweet, which I wasn't expecting at all but I should have after reading those two items on it. It was delicious!! I'm not a fan of crispy pita but it all worked out very well and complimented the whole dish. And you could always substitute the pita for cucumbers for an additional charge, but if you do do that, make sure you have already tried it with the pita first!!   Chicken panini with salut fries. I had a bite of the chicken panini and completely stole the fries (I love good fries!). The chicken panini wasn't too special to me, I mean it's pretty good but I'd rather have the fries honestly! Between the vinaigrette they use and the feta cheese it was good!  And the bruschetta was a choose 3 for $13, so I ended up with the garlic, caprese, and pesto. Out of the three I think my favorite was the caprese mostly because of the mozzerella and balsamic reduction made it the best of the three, but they were all good.   Next time though I think we'll just stick with the hummus nachos because that was the most delicious out of all of them!   Now, onto the drinks!   I first got the mi amor, which was stronger then I expected, always a good thing! It was actually pretty good, between all the craft cocktails this one sounded like it was the most delicious only because of the chambord and pineapple juice really, but the belvedere and champagne helped.   Got a oh honey mule which had honey vodka, cucumbers, strawberries, ginger beer, and lime juice. I'm not sure between the mi amor or the honey mule which was better. Maybe the mule? It was definitely stronger but it was delicious, I could down the whole cup without thinking anything of it but don't be fooled if you did do that, you'd definitely be feeling it pretty quickly!!   I can't wait for the next time I'm in the area, friends, good food, and good drinks are always what someone needs after any day!   Also they're pet friendly!! You can bring your pups out to their outdoor patio which is always great! Why leave them at home when you can bring them to hang out?",

It was a fantastic red house that was semi sweet. Unfortunately I can't remember exactly what it was.    Anyways I ordered a chicken panini that was good,  but not spectacular.  I wish I had ordered plain fries though,  because I was not a fan of the toppings.  Definitely a selected taste. I loved the atmosphere so I'll definitely come back,  but will try something else.  Service was good as well,  always had full water and a happy server.  We even ran into corporate which gave us a discount on shots!  (We were here for a 21st bday).",

I have many years experience in the restaurant industry and am currently in the medical field, I typically never write reviews and am quite used to poor service. Since being in the restaurant service I am very reasonable with resturants as I typically understand. The man that brought us our water and who was running other tables food had cuts all over his hands and pus was oozing out, We surprisingly ate because he did not run our food. This is very disturbing and should at the lightest be wrapped completely. I highly doubt the man had any sort of disease, but this is how people get sick and virus ect spread. The least he could do is wrap his hand if he wants to be serving food to the community. Very disgusted in the service and health of this restaurant, we will never be going back.",

We made a reservation for 7pm on a Monday night since we wanted a quieter atmosphere. Upon entering the restaurant we were immediately greeted by a host at the front door who led us to our seats. The server came out to get our orders and was very nice and helpful. He helped me choose my entree. We started out with cocktails which were served in crazy looking glass dishes and tasted awesome! I got the Lavender Lemon Fizz and my boyfriend ordered the Dark & Stormy. For entrees, we ordered the Pistachio Crusted Salmon and Chicken Chasseur. Once we tried our dishes, we were put in our happy places! The salmon was very moist and served on a bed of orzo pasta cooked in wine while the pistachio gave it that added crunchy texture. My boyfriend enjoyed the chicken chasseur as well. I would highly recommend coming back to this place, and the dark/quiet atmosphere is great for a date night on the weekdays!",

    "text": "For drinks, not a bad spot.  It's a decent atmosphere a good selection of beer, wines.  For food, based on the one item I have ordered, I will not return.  I ordered an appetizer of hummus with veggies.  The plate arrived with a small bowl of hummus, carrots, celery, cucumber and pita.  The carrots were cut into nickel and quarter size slices (and about as thin).  They were dry...as in when you leave them in a fridge all night uncovered.  The celery was bruised, dried and even a bit decaying on one side.  The cuc's were sliced too thin to even dip them in the hummus.  I didn't even bother trying the pita or hummus and sent the dish back.  I was surprised anyone would have the poor judgment to serve the poor quality of food that was on this plate.  This speaks to a poorly operated kitchen and chefs/cooks that just do not care, IMHO.  I suppose my expectations were too high.  A college town just cannot support more than one or two decent wine bars and this one is suffering from an identity crisis.  Cater to adults that expect good drink AND good food or cater to 20-somethings looking for cheap drinks?  I admit, I'm quick to judge and loathe to give second chances, but seriously, if you can't pass an appetizer test, why would I drop even more cash on dinners there?",

    "text": "Went there twice. Both times I was disappointed because in oversight the drinks are weak and the food is average and everything is overpriced for what you're getting. In general I'm not a fan of places that don't offer good food or good people. It reminded me of a French restaurant very cold and uppity. Both times the service was not worthy of congratulating. The manager circled a few times but never came to the table to ask how everything was which was disappointing because a few things were bothering me. The first time I went our waitress was nice and after we paid, two girls from our table left and a new one joined, but the waitress never checked back on us so we had to flag her down. I asked her for a menu because i was going to order something to eat and when she came back with my friend's drink she didn't bring a menu. The drink was wrong which happens but just added to the disappointment. I never got a menu from the waitress so I asked for one From the table next to ours but the waitress didn't come back for 30 minutes and when she did it was only to drop off the bill for my friend s drink and she never even asked if we had wanted another round, which we did. I decided to go back a second time and got better service as far as check -backs, but the drink still came out wrong twice. Then what will keep me from ever going back was my salad. I ordered the strawberry fields salad and was so sad when it came because I was hungry and although I eat in tiny bites I finished it in 10 bites!! And it cost 11 dollars and looked like crap with only one piece of feta. Just not a fan for paying for nothing and that's how I felt there.",

We had a table outside next to some odds pillars which actually need up turning an otherwise expansive area into a quaint little dinner for two.  We started with some delicious mushroom ravioli.  The sauce was creamy and flavorful but not too rich and filling.  I went with a skinny mojito which turned out to be one of the better mojitos I've ever had the pleasure of consuming.  My beautiful fiance ordered a champagne and chambord drink, following the deft recommendation by our waiter.  She loved it. It wasn't too sweet and definitely had some alcohol in there.  We ordered a Malbec burger and their chicken panini on a French toast bread. Both items were ridiculously tasty.  The wine and carmelized onions on the Malbec burger were the highlights of this perfectly cooked beef delight.  The chicken while not as spectacular as the burger was destroyed just as quickly.  It had a delicious melted cheesy and slightly spicy peppers that gave it a great flavor.  They have excellent drink specials throughout the week that we've already planned on going back for. I would definitely suggest that you check out this Tempe gem especially if your around the ASU/Tempe marketplace area.  Oh yes the server was awesome too.",

Death in the Afternoon is one of my favorites and rather unusual, but they also serve absinthe by the glass ($5), which is a lovely surprise. We met friends for dinner; I had a panini with brie, apples, arugula, prosciutto and honey butter and Greek fries (shoestring fries with lemon balsamic dressing and feta). It's similar to another pricey favorite, the Citizen Public House gastro-pub, but much more reasonable and relaxed. There was a family at the next table toasting s'mores! They repurpose wine and liquor bottles for decor, and there's a big outdoor patio with lights and tables. Our server was attentive and helpful with suggestions, and had no problems handling our table's separate checks. I will definitely be heading back for happy hour (all cocktails $5).",

The staff acted like we were lepers due to a Groupon and nobody seemed to be able to figure out what the Groupon was offering us....even though it was in black and white.  The manager was there but completely refused to come out to assist the clueless staff in any way.  There was an obvious training issue as the staff stood around like zombies trying to figure out what was going on.....one after another.  I decided to continue through and try the food.  Another complete disaster, a beautiful looking piece of salmon completely overcooked and ruined.  The chicken also resembled a hockey puck.  Returned the food barely eaten and did not even want to give the \"chef\" another opportunity to ruin more food on my behalf.  Even after all of this, the poor bartender.....nice guy despite being put in a terrible position by his obviously incompetent manager....told me that the manager was just too busy to come out and address the situation.  Good effort to right a wrong by the bartender, weak managing.  Maybe the manager was simply worn out from addressing complaints.  Never, ever again.",

    "text": "The happy hour specials and groupons lured me and my friends here on a weekday evening, but I was quite disappointed. First of all, about half the \"tapas\" (which are actually just appetizers) on the happy hour menu were the same price as they are on the regular menu ($5 or more) . Also, the food was alright. The peppy dew peppers were yummy, but the other \"tapas\" we tried were pretty mediocre, at best. They said they were out of one appetizer when we were ordering, but we saw another table order and receive it about 30 minutes later. They were short on menus, despite being far less than 25% capacity at the time. Some of these may just be growing pains of a new restaurant. There were also tons of flies around, which was pretty annoying. We didn't get any entrees so I can't speak to that, and the wines in the wine flight seemed reasonably good. Another drawback: if you get seated in the back section, there are no windows and very limited lighting (the waiter couldn't even see the water glasses well enough to know whether he needed to fill them up or not).",

    "text": "Unfortunately my friends and I had a terrible experience! My friend had made a reservation on open table for 8 of us. A couple of us got there a little early to get in for happy hour. They only had a table for 4 for our party. They told us we could wait at the bar while a table was set up for us. Another reservation of 5 came in with the same problem about a half hour later. Our table still hadn't been set up and they brought in another table from outside for this other reservation while we were still waiting. A ton of tables opened up but they kept giving them away to customers who just walked in. An hour had gone by before they actually had a table ready for us by which point we were done our food and decided to leave. Paying was even more of a nightmare. We ate on happy hour specials, but for three of us splitting a check they decided to charge us an already included 20% gratuity on what the whole bill would have been if it wasn't happy hour! (There also ended up only being 4 of us there so it was not a big party). So basically giving themselves about a 60% tip! So when we asked about it, it took almost half an hour to get our bill figured out with the bar staff. I originally paid with one of those Visa gift cards. I knew it wouldn't work to void it but gave it back to him anyway. I ended up putting it on my debit card. It took 6 days for them to fix the double charges on my checking account and 8 days to work out the void on the gift card. The owner was so nice and the food was alright, but so not worth the miscommunication between the staff and our wait time!",

    "text": "For four years, when it was only a 10 minute walk away from me, I obviously never went. My coworker suggested Salut, there was an app on Hooked for BOGO burger, and a break from work was desperately needed so off we went.    My friend and I ordered the Malbec burger, medium-rare, sans onions. I appreciated the pretty interior while waiting for our food. The lights were interesting to look at and there were bottles of wine stored in a glass showcase on the back wall. There are high chairs to sit at the bar, or tables, or booths inside and plenty of seating outside as well if you're in the mood for some sun and breeze. Our burgers arrived with heaping fries on the side. Delicious! The burger was cooked to perfection and tasted impeccable with the Malbec sauce and mushrooms. I think my favorite part of the burger was the bun. Brioche buns toasted slightly with butter. MHMMMM.   Just the burger alone was quite filling. I couldn't eat the fries. I'm glad we decided to forgo an appetizer because I can't even imagine how full I would have been. The restaurant was relatively empty as we were there, but it wasn't ghost town. The only downside is that they have only 3 burgers (if you want to use the Hooked deal) and the sandwiches on the menu don't count. There was a large sign that advertised 50% off wine by the bottle during happy hours. Not bad at all!   Give it a try if you're looking for a juicy flavorful burger and some good wine :)",

We got chicken/waffles and qinoa pancakes. By the way they have bottomless mimosas. Wow. I think they use Wycliff champagne which I like. Anyway our server was great. KYLE. He was very attentive and never let our cups get empty. This was important more so for the water because we had just come in from a 2 hour photo shoot in the AZ sun. Thanks again Kyle. Also he was new and we didnt even know until his trainer asked how he was doing at the end. I think he will do well here because he knew the menu and was quick to serve.   Try this place. Wont be disappointed. Did I mention I got tableside S'mores for my birthday. Thats why I choose the place and so happy. Will be back once a month for sure.",

Our waitress brought waters right away and our drink orders, giving us time to look over the menu. She was the only waitress that I saw but was keeping all of her tables happy, was prompt with drink and food delivery, and had time to be personable and ask us about our weekend plans and make small talk. We love salut and we're recreating our first date today so THANK YOU, we always leave happy!",

Its also good if you have some people who are vegetarian they have many options for them while still having a good variety of burgers and sandwiches. I unfortunately have not been thrilled with the entres I got the last few times ive come including the chicken sandwich which I got this last time which was a bit dry. But I would still come for their apps and happy hour.",

I don't know how you mess up an order of 3 in a completely empty restaurant? Bartender didn't offer to help till asked. Again, no one in bar so why so lazy? We ordered the bread pudding to share and were hugely disappointed. The bread was quite dry and served with only a drizzle of caramel on the plate. We left over half of it as it was too hard to swallow. Server was good . Bathrooms have dirty walls and door. Burgers were good but not worth the pricey bill overall so we won't be back.",

They were so nice and the ambience of this restaurant was perfect to share with so many close friends. We had our own private area and our server did the PERFECT job of making sure we were all happy. I believe the general manager was there and he went above and beyond to make sure it was a great birthday experience. The drinks at this place are strong and delicious! And the food was super yummy. Every time we go to Karaoke right around the corner, we will definitely be at Salut Kitchen first. Thanks for such a great evening and making my birthday special.",

I usually only sit at the bar or occasionally the outside patio. The owner Tassos is so genuinely friendly and will remember you each time you come in if you talk with him once. He is always there too.   The employees are all truly happy to be there. Nicole, kona, chief, Riley, and Will are absolutely incredible. They are the \"above and beyond\" type that are the reason I have become a regular. I'm sure the others are great but I haven't interacted with them. I had Ashley as my bartender once and she was a dud. Totally ignored me and I had to have someone else (an assistant manager) offer to get my drinks as she helped others who sat down after me. Whatever, one poor bartender won't spoil this place and it's other amazing employees for me.   As a side note the giant patio is dog friendly! I love me some doggies.",

I'm not a fan of quinoa typically, but I enjoyed these pancakes.  They were fluffy yet filling.  The farmhouse omelette was typical, what'd you want and expect in an omelette.  The potatoes served on the side were not my favorite.  The potato was cut up into suuuper tiny chunks that was difficult to eat.  I would have preferred bigger pieces.  The chicken and waffles was good also.  I loved the waffle!  I don't know if chicken + waffle is my favorite pairing though.  Definitely a large portion and extremely filling.  We came at around 10:15 and the patio was pretty empty.  However, when we were leaving around 11:30 it was filled up quite a bit.",

The person taking the call said it looked ok in the books, but due to the size of the party, she needed to confirm with a Manager and would call back. I was called back shortly thereafter and given confirmation for the date, time and head count. When we arrived all was well until I had to ask about the reservation, and was told there was none! They did think they could squeeze us in if willing to sit outdoors......in 105 degree heat. No thank you. As we all stood at the bar trying to conjure up a last minute alternative we were offered an indoor seat next to the front door. Ok, so not ideal but better than nothing. Food was fair as was the service. As you might guess, I won't be returning.",

    "text": "Salut Kitchen Bar is around the corner from my work, so I come here occasionally for lunch. Great little restaurant with some unique dishes like hummus nachos (delicious) and fried quinoa fritters (also nomz). My favorite dish so far is the mushroom ravioli on the appetizer menu. It's big enough to count as lunch, very creamy and flavorful. (I am always full after eating it, but a big man might not consider it enough food.) The bruchettas are amazing - best one is the mushroom bruchetta. I've also tried their chicken sandwich, grilled cheese, chopped salad, and pesto pasta. Everything is high-quality and tasty.      Given that I'm usually here at 11am during the week, it's pretty quiet inside. The music selection is always great - a mix of house music and electronic music! Nice Spotify playlist! I imagine that things can get loud on the weekends when you've got drunk ASU students on the patio. I like that the patio is dog-friendly and I may bring my dogs here one day.  Salut has a mailing list you can get on, where they send you text messages with coupons for free appetizers and discounts on meals.  5 stars for food and staff, 4 stars for ambiance, 4 stars for prices (can be a little expensive for lunch). They have good happy hour deals. Nice spot to take your significant other on a classy, affordable date!",

This place gets two stars for the outdoor ambience only.  A table of 4 took 3hrs to move through dinner service with only 3 other tables in the entire bar on a Saturday night. the wine is way overpriced even for restaurant markup.  I looked up most of the wine on Vivino and they are selling $6.99 for more the 4x markup and is of the lowest rated wines on vivino averaging 3 stars.  The food was cold when received, wine pours will small at best, the vodka soda was flat and sent back and to top it off please look at the photo for their second try at making truffle fries.  They dumped the entire bottle of seasoning ruining the already room temperature fries. With so many more options in tempe marketplace steer clear of Salut.",

The waitress was super patient as we couldn't decide what to order...everything sounded delicious!  We started with the hummus nachos. In my opinion, it's an absolute must!! The pita bread was perfectly toasted. The balsamic gave the perfect balance. Topped with a pomegranate seed to bring it all together. I ordered a burger and requested it to be prepared medium. It was more on the medium well side. Not a deal breaker. It was still very juicy! I do wish there were low carb options. Maybe lettuce wrapped? Still, this is definitely a restaurant that has earned a return visit.",

The place is small on the inside with a large patio on the  outside, which will be perfect during the cooler months. Just don't let them sit you in the back corner because you will feel \"walled-in\"...I had to ask to be moved one time because I couldn't stand being back there.  I felt banished! So, upon walking in, if they don't make a left or right from the main entrance, you're going straight for the wall. If you are with a group you may not mind it, but a table for two just wont' cut it.  I do have to say although the food is good, I am not impressed by the menu.  It was just so limited for someone who has a colorful palette.  The waitstaff is efficient and friendly.  I'll go back but more for the drinks at happy hour!",

    "text": "I am torn on this one.  Food wise it is THE BEST restaurant I have been to in quite a long time.  I loved the ambiance of the couch booths outside and the food and even the wine was delish.  The part I am torn on is it felt sleezy in the used car lot vibe.  First off there are chalkboards out front advertising happy hour $1 bottles of wine.  Same thing on the front of the menu.  (Actually it is also listed that way on the front page of their website.) I actually asked as soon as I sat down if that was a joke.  I was informed you buy a bottle at regular price and the second is $1.  You have to ask or turn over your menu to see that detail.  No asterisk, no small print, nothing.  Is that even legal advertising?!  Second we had a groupon for 4 flights of wine and 2 tapas or bruschetta plates.  The wine was the first to come out.  We were told they were a chardonnay, a merlot and a cabernet sauvignon all from a vineyard in California.  We first tried the white wine and enjoyed it.  Surprised that it tasted like no chardonnay we had ever had we asked with the menu which chardonnay from CA it was.  The waiter left and came back and told us that actually he was wrong and the flight wines are all tap wines from a barrel made in Tuscon?!?!  What is tap wine?  Third when we got our bill only one appetizer was taken off.  When the waiter was informed of the mistake he argued a bit that the groupon was only for one appetizer.  He had to take the coupon out of his pocket to inspect it again.  Then he left and came back having taken off the $4 fries we added on later instead of the $7 Hummus nachos that we had originally ordered as part of the deal.  I pointed it out again and he gave some excuse about timing and the computer taking off least expensive items.  Whatever!  Now onto the food... I had: Hummus Nachos - HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Greek Fries - VERY GOOD! Halloumi Bruschetta - Tasty with a relish/pickled flavoring Grilled Filet Mignon - AMAZING! Wilted Greens with Bacon - Good.  Parmesan French Toast with Tomato Basil Relish - MMMMM... the tomato basil relish was spicy in a sriracha flavored way  My friends tried the Bee Hive sandwich.  One really liked it and one liked everything except the thick sliced prosciutto.    I'm hesitant to go back.... but the food is calling to me... what to do... what to do...",

I've been here for a birthday brunch, too, and the staff has always been very attentive and responsive. The staff is a ton of fun and even played a game of Heads Up with us after we finished up brunch.  As many have said before, the hummus nachos are to die for. Seriously though, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu here. It's definitely a favorite joint of mine in Tempe, and the patio area is the perfect place to spend recovering from a hangover on a late Sunday afternoon if you feel like being a little classier than normal.",

Not only that but the breakfast food was good quality and came out in a timely manner, I haven't had to wait in a ridiculous breakfast line to get food, and the patio is just so nice to enjoy with some sprinkles of sunlight and gentle murmur of the fellow patrons enjoying brunch there. The service took a little bit of time and has been hit or miss the 2 times we have been, but all in all quite a nice experience and will be back!",

Now the chicken was tasty but for some reason  it was missing seasoning and because it is fried chicken it was unexpectedly bland. I also had a Bloody Mary too and very weak and I'm not a big drinker either but I'm giving 4 stars because I still liked the restaurant and I'm sure they have other yummy stuff on the menu that I want to try and they have potential bc of location and staff.",

    "text": "I wish my first time at Salut was as good as I'd hoped. I part of a group of 10 who had a reservation on a Saturday night. Salut was still carrying Restaurant Week options as a few in the party chose that. The restaurant was not busy at all during our dinner, perhaps 5-10 tables total were occupied including ours.  My best guess is since not everyone arrived at the same time, it threw our server for a loop. She never introduced herself to us (I think her name was Hannah?), skipped some of the party who wanted to order drinks and mixed up some of our dinner plates. The dinner plates were not known to be mixed until the girl next to me was a few bites in to her salmon and told that \"the plate wasn't meant for you\". It was better than the other salmon option she'd ordered anyway, thankfully they didn't up-charge for our server's error. My pasta dish was superb despite a little extra lemon zest in the sauce. Beers are well-priced. Those who ordered RW never received their dessert because we waited forever for our checks and didn't want to risk getting another salty glare from our server (following the plate mixup). Overall, it just seemed like a big uncomfortable hot mess, surprising since the place wasn't that busy! Not sure if I'd return, the entire dinner was just MEH.",

We took a look at the menu/reviews prior to coming and thought we would try it out. Came in around 7pm and there were two customers at the bar and no one else seated. We were greeted right away and told to sit anywhere. We chose a booth and were served waters right away. The man who sat us and brought the water said our server would be right with us. The server was to be the bartender. The bartender was on the phone so we sat and waited.  About 10 min went by, we had our orders in mind and he was still on the phone and hadn't been to the table yet. The initial man was just kind of hanging out by the bar area. We were starving at this point we just decided to go somewhere else.   I still want to try this place out one day because the reviews are pretty good but last night didn't work out because we were hungry and kind of bummed about the service.",

We decided to try somewhere new for brunch today and since Salut is so close to our new house we thought maybe it could be another regular brunch place for us. Their website is fantastic and made everything look so appetizing which is part of why we chose it but I guess you really can't judge a book by its cover. The morning burger my fiance ordered was barely seasoned and the brioche bun looks like it came from a fast food place the presentation was barely adequate by any reataurants standard. My breakfast pita was already soggy when I got it and tasted like it was made for someone on a bland diet in a retirement facility. The experience wouldn't have been so bad if the team members actually smiled and welcomed us in (excluding the younger gentleman in the front who actually acknowledged us walking in) the girl behind the bar looked and acted as if she hates being there and could barely be bothered to answer a question, very off putting especially since she is in the hospitality/ service field. Over all it was a less than mediocre experience and will not be returning.",

We started off with just wine and made our way to shared appetizers. They were really nice. However, the wines we started with were what we came for. An afternoon wine session relaxing and chatting with friends. Our friends require a gluten-free option, and this place had it pretty sorted. Nice GF options, which is always good.  We ended up drinking 3 bottles of wine over several hours and they were all great..  Definitely be back again.",

I've been to Salute about 5 times in the last year including happy hour and a special occasion birthday dinner. Every time service has been impeccable. I joined the club and I get emails with special offers often. I like that!    The quinoa salad is awesome as is their chicken skewer. It was HUGE! The strawberry feta salad is equally as tasty. The toasted walnuts give is a delicious crunch. During a lunch visit, I had the caprese salad -- fresh tomatoes with mozzarella balsamic dressing on a beautiful afternoon on the patio was perfect. Once, I met friends for drinks there and we ended up having the s'mores fondue too. OMG. Chocolate heaven. Try it!   Last night I noticed the TVs on the patio. Totally missed those before. The World Series was on and the patio was lively with chatter and cheers for the Cubs. Really fun environment. The only tiny issue with the patio, which can't be helped is the vehicle noise from McClintock Drive. Loud cars driving too fast can be annoying. Good thing it ends quickly!  Noise doesn't deter me from patio seating though. It's a great place to relax. Bring your pup too! The patio is dog friendly which is special. Love that.   Salut, keep it up!  I'm bringing friends!",

The restaurant is cute, well decorated, but empty for dinner at 6pm on a Sunday night?? (Red flag???). Waitress was lovely but at no time did she talk about the menu or offer her favorite suggestions.   I chose the $44 restaurant week special, which included an appetizer (I chose the grilled romaine salad), seafood pasta entree and pineapple sorbet. The salad was flavorful but way overdressed and quite small. The entree was less than par with the minimal amount of actual seafood (bay shrimp, microscopic clams and squid). The only redeeming factor was that the pasta was cooked well. The sorbet was like eating shaved ice with canned pineapple chunks. I left hungry and not even satisfied with my fruit Moscow mule. Oh and with 20% tip, $68 bill. Bummer  Too bad as I was really hoping to share this little gem with my friends.",

I will warn you though that if you have a sound-sensitive pet, the traffic noise from University can be a little frightening for them.  The interior of the restaurant is modern and clean, pairing well with their menu of fresh options. I'm a big fan of their creative and filling bruschetta boards.

For $33 per person, you got a 3 course meal + a glass of house wine. It is hard to beat that! I ordered their strawberry spinach salad, the filet kebabs with chimichurri sauce, and their dessert was an orange-sicle cheesecake with raspberry sorbet on top and fresh strawberries. I also loved their house cab! My fiance got the hummus nachos topped with pomegranate seeds, balsamic, and feta - HOLY HEAVEN, so good! These are a must! ...and the salmon entree which he loved!

    "text": "Attended happy hour with work pals recently. Not a great happy hour line up, but I'll take $2 off a few beers just the same. Craft cocktails looked delicious and those who tried them had nice things to say but I'm just not about $15 a glass. But hey, you get $2 off right? A short list of plates that get happy hour discount. Just kinda eh. My gluten sensitive colleague ordered the hummus nachos sub cucumber for pita triangles. I don't feel a $3 upcharge was commensurate with 4 cucumber slices he got instead of 4 pita triangles. The service was great, manager checked on us several times, we each paid our own tabs without any fuss at all. Dog friendly patio though I didn't see any pups to pet until the end. I would probably go back under similar circumstances. I realize the company I had made it a great night, but Salut seemed like a place it's ok to slow sip on their patio. Hey, it's like Casey Moore's for older,l wine drinking people. Dear goodness, I'm an older wine person? No, I still had beer. Phew!",

I counted 6 servers at one time just standing by the bar playing rock, paper, scissor, it was cute but we were not only hungry, our drinks were low. The only time it seemed we were important paying customers was when the manager came out to apologize for the longest wait time for the food, I would have thought it was for the service but hey, at least he noticed.  Let's move onto the food, friends had the risotto appetizer and thought it was great. My partner in crime had the classic and said it was over done and nothing to brag about. I got the chicken applewood, thought they did good, more bun then chicken but who needs the carbs.  Overall the poor service and long wait time on food makes it hard to return.",

The staff is really friendly and knowledgeable, the selection of drinks and food is solid, and the overall feel of the place is really fun.   The bottomless mimosas are great - pre-mixed but served in a real wine glass so you don't have to worry about having an empty glass after 2 sips like most bottomless mimosas places.   I really like the Breakfast Pita - the bacon is awesome and the side of fruit is some of the best fruit I've had at a restaurant.   I've only sat inside, but I really want to try out the patio next time because it looks like a really fun place to be with music and lots of vegetation.   The location is great for us - a good in between place if you're meeting someone from Mesa and Tempe, so we will definitely be back!",

Walked right in and were seated right away.  It has a love ambiance, warm, dark and inviting.  The service was fabulous, loved the gal helping us, she was friendly, helpful and just a solid human being.  The happy hour runs through the weekend, so we were able to snag some great deals on food - the shoe string fires (Salut Fries) with lemon and cheese was UNBELIEVABLE!  I am fairly sure it took us roughly 2.6 minutes to clean up the whole thing.  Fresh ingredients, homemade balsamic reduction, and deliciously and plentiful beer and wine options makes this place a totally win!  They have a cool array of absinthe drinks too, which we didn't try but they looked intriguing.  We loved everything about this spot and will totally be back when we are in the area!",

She happily rang up our bill based on what we had instead of giving us one bill for 16 people.  Good in concept but overall, I would not go back based on the food (taste/quality/value).",

The recycled palet wood used both decoratively and functionally was SO well done, and the lighting is beautiful!  Our service was perfectly timed and friendly.   That said, I am not a person who enjoys a restaurant simply for the scene and good service. Your food must match (or at least approach) your ambience, and Salut's menu absolutely did :)  We began our meal with an order of Ciprian Salsa bruschetta, which was lovely and fresh.  I enjoyed the roasted corn salad as an entree, and my friend had the brie hive.  Both were fresh, seasoned well, and portioned perfectly (especially for a health-conscious preggo; not too little, but not so much that I left feeling overly full!) Can't wait to bring my husband back here for one of their signature drinks or a glass off of their wine list (see you in a few months, Salut!)",

The cocktails were good as well.  I had a skinny mojito which was spunky and refreshing.  A short while after ordering our meal we had someone tell us our food was 12 minutes out. That 12 minutes turned into over an hour. We were then told the food was put on rush, but it came out lukewarm at best. My husband's burger was tasty but was well done and he wanted it to be medium rare. I had a brie sandwich and my friend had a grilled cheese that we split. Neither were that amazing. Maybe if they have been hotter they could have been.  Our other friends got a chicken pasta dish, which they said was actually really amazing. To his credit, the manager did offer us dessert to make it right and it was good, so it shows he cares. The server was good, and nice. The main issue was just how backed up the food was. The atmosphere was really cute and charming. On a less busy night this may be a place to visit again, but most likely just for drinks and appetizers.",

The service was great both times I went.  Absenthe is their \"thing\" however, I did NOT care for it.  But it is an awesome experience to share with friends and it's only $5...deal.  As far as the mimosas...eh.  I've had better.  They were made with some kind of concentrate and it was much more O.J. than it was champagne.  That will make for quite the harsh heart burn...yikes.  Again service was KILLER so I was still pleasantly surprised.  I also had the 'meaty' omelet....it was d'lish!  They do not let your mimosa even begin to get low before they're back filling it up again...although, I attribute that to the fact that they're primarily O.J.  Eh, oh well!

My $13 bruschetta certainly was not bad. The toppings were actually quite delicious, but the bread tasted as though they picked it up from Fry's a few days ago. Pictured here are the fig, apple, wild mushroom, and pesto options, with a couple pieces missing ;). My white wine was served at room temp, which I was not thrilled about, but it was still drinkable. The service was below average, although our server was nice. All in all, I've experienced better. But I'd come back and give it a second shot if a friend suggested it- I just wouldn't do the suggesting.",

I ordered the salut sampler, which was $19 pre-tax, and it was a joke! It only had one mac and cheese bite, two small quinoa fritters, less than a handful of fries, and the half of a caprese salad. The fries were stale and cold.  The caprese salad was soggy and gross.  Not even worth $9, much less $19!  It is seriously outrageous that they charge that much for almost no food!  The salad barely had anything in it. Their menu definitely over sells their food. I was seriously disappointed and if I had ordered this at the restaurant myself, I would have demanded a refund!  Save your money and time and go somewhere else!",

    "text": "Loved coming here a few times for happy hour so I really wanted to love Sunday Brunch, alas, was not to be.  After making a reservation a month in advance for a group of eight, we arrived at Salut and were relegated to what I refer to as an overflow table.  You know, the worst table in the restaurant that's usually given to last minute walk ins.  Directly next to the speakers for the band playing that morning.  Any chance of conversing with my friends, disappeared with the first set.    Granted, if you were across the room or even a few tables away, the music was fantastic.  But, I expect to have to shout to friends at a nightclub in order to be heard, not at a Sunday Brunch.  The manager was anything but apologetic or accomodating, his only comment was that it says there's music on the website.  And no, couldn't get another table even though when I asked, there was plenty of tables open.  Food was lukewarm at best and nothing special.  However, I do have to give a shout out to our waiter, Chief, he really worked hard and was very friendly, although he too had to yell.  C'mon, if someone makes a reservation, don't give them the worst table in the house.  Have to wonder if it had something to do with us not being part of the college set.",

They also had s'mores that you could make at your table which was super cool, but I would have like the option of a better chocolate than Hershey's. I get that they are probably trying to resurrect childhood memories but if you are paying top dollar, might as well class it up a bit.   I LOVE the cucumber water and the decor. And all the food tastes really fresh. My friend got a drink (grapefruit martini) and said it was tasty and strong.",

The cocktail I ordered was sickening sweet and I ended up trading with my fiance for his moscow mule.  The mule wasn't overly sweet but there were muddled cucumbers that got stuck in your teeth every time you took a sip.  I had the brie sandwich that seemed pretty small and uninteresing.  My fiance had a burger and that was really tasty.  The reason I took this place down a star is because we both ended up feeling sick the next day from the food.  Bottom line, after trying this place out twice, is that I will only be back for the hh wine special.  This place has just missed the mark on the food.",

We came here with a group of 10 to celebrate my friend's birthday and when we got there our table was already ready for us. The servers were great and very attentive and also very personable and helpful. We had to split the check 5-6 ways and they were more than accommodating to that. The alcohol was great and we got my friend a handful of shots that were recommended by the server and my friend said they all tasted great. I got the JJ chicken sandwich and I must say that was probably one of the better chicken sandwiches I've had in awhile. The chicken was crispy and juicy, the sauce they put in the sandwich was really tasty and the texture and combination of everything was just really good! I got an order of friends which were really good, crispy, and well seasoned. I tasted the Salut fries that my friend ordered and they were also really good! if you like that vinegary, tarty flavor, you'll definitely like those fries. Service was great and atmosphere was also very welcoming and the restaurant was clean. My friend got a smores plate for her birthday treat which was awesome because it was enough to share with the whole table. The drinks sometimes did take a little longer and they forgot a few of our drinks, but it's ok, it happens. Everything that evening went pretty well except for when it came time to paying. The checks were not split correctly and drinks were on the wrong checks. The server had to take some of the checks back to correct them and when they were brought back to us, they were still wrong. It took a good while for the server to go back to the computer and update the checks and still drinks were missing from the checks. So we paid the checks \"as is\" because we were getting a bit annoyed. Then they later came back with separate checks for the missing drinks that they forgot to put on the initial tabs so that was also pretty annoying. Aside from the paying, everything else was pretty good and I would recommend this place and would want to come back to try their brunch.",

    "text": "Meant to stop in for happy hour apps and cocktail, but instead tried their Restaurant Week $30 three-course menu (app, entree, and dessert) and a glass of house wine (cabernet or pinot grigio), or draft.  I decided to try the Goat cheese-stuffed Peppadews, the Malbec burger (comes with Salut fries), and Chocolate cake, with a glass of cabernet to compliment the burger.  I've had peppadews stuffed with goat cheese before (at Fez), so I knew these would be tasty.  The peppers were raw (as opposed to the roasted peppadews at Fez, or that's how I recall them to be, anyway), so they added crunch to the experience, and were stuffed with a sweetened goat cheese filling, then sprinkled with herbs and drizzled with a very mild-tasting vegetable oil.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salut-kitchen-bar-tempe?select=H7ExguXj2xipVp4CTDxM4Q#H7ExguXj2xipVp4CTDxM4Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/salu...</a>  I ate two of the four peppadews (to pace myself for the coming burger and dessert...).  I ordered the Malbec burger without mushrooms and tomatoes (allergies), and while Maham forgot to ask how I liked the temperature, she said she asked for medium (\"red in the center\"), but the burger arrived without any hints of pinkness at all.  However, it was still juicy and tender.  The bun was good- looked and tasted like it may be supplied from a local bakery.  Without the mushrooms and tomatoes to temper the sweetness from the caramelized onions, this burger tasted almost too sweet.  No matter- I just took a few Salut fries, shoestring fries topped with feta and parmesan, which leant the saltiness to counter the sweet onions.  Loved the citrus vinaigrette drizzle on the fries- YUM!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salut-kitchen-bar-tempe?select=AiLPBPynnsej5zssNM6x1g#AiLPBPynnsej5zssNM6x1g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/salu...</a>  For dessert, I had my choice of S'mores, cheesecake, or chocolate cake, and I almost can never say no to chocolate cake, especially when the description mentions a drizzle of both chocolate and white chocolate sauces, but as you can see, my dessert only came with a dark chocolate drizzle.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salut-kitchen-bar-tempe?select=58Yym4133_Nrx9H61x2M4A#58Yym4133_Nrx9H61x2M4A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/salu...</a>  My sadness was only fleeting, as I tasted my first bite... oh, this cake tasted definitely of homemade dark chocolate batter, sauce, and ganache filling and frosting!  (No use of powdered sugar, cornstarch, or corn syrup- I asked!)  One of the best-tasting chocolate layered cakes I've tasted in a long time, complete with semi-sweet mini-chocolate chips on the outside edge...  Not very sweet, so I ate about half of it- oops!  :)  I hadn't planned on participating in Restaurant Week this season, but I'm glad to be able to recommend Salut's participation.  Thank you, Salut and Maham, for making RW fun again!",

    "text": "I came here last Friday with friends and a Living Social deal. The deal on the living social website clearly said it included two cocktails, one appetizer and an entree of my choice. When I brought up the deal on my phone, it showed it was only valid for the two drinks and one appetizer, NO entree. While that probably isn't the restaurant's fault, it was pretty annoying but didn't try and prove the error and just decided to enjoy myself. It's also important to note that you can't use a LS deal before 6 or 6:30 (can't remember which now). Hence the reason for the tiny print at the bottom that said 'Reservations Required'. Luckily they kept me hydrated with water while we waited the 20 minutes for my deal to be good. It's a cute spot and initially I was sat outside because the Happy Hour was hoping inside and no tables were available. I could see this patio as a really nice spot to come hang out once the weather cools off and enjoy their happy hour special of buy one bottle of wine, get the next one for $1. Unfortunately I had a big group of smokers join me on the patio and that mixed with the misters was pretty gross. Being a former smoker, I appreciate my clean air! It would be nice if they could go somewhere else beside the patio.  Having said that, the server was friendly, sat us inside after about a 10 minute wait and she had no issues using the LS deal. I ordered the grapefruit martini and the Peach Fuzz Fizz as drinks and both were delicious! For an appetizer I chose the Peppy Dew Peppers. I wasn't sure what I was going to get but a new love of goat cheese prompted me to give them a try. When 4 little peppers were brought out on a wooden board (for $8), I was a bit surprised at the small portions. That was until I had my first bite. They were incredible! I loved them! Definitely crave worthy! Each pepper was two bites, which equals about a $1 a bite. Worth every penny in my opinion! We also shared the Salut Fries, which were pretty good. A nice dipping sauce would have really set them off though. All entrees were pretty good (Roasted Corn Salad with Chicken) and while their salad plates were oddly proportioned and it looked like you didn't get much, the salad filled me up and was really good. The server was great, attentive and friendly the whole night so I came out of there a happy camper that night.  Fast forward to the next Friday and I'd been thinking about those peppers every day! I decided this time to take advantage of the LocalDines deal and head back for more of that pepper heaven and introduce my fiance to the best thing I've eaten in awhile. He agreed they were great! This time we opted for beers (hooray! They have Papago Orange Blossom!!) and shared a Sun Devil sandwich and the Italian Panini. Neither one was really great but I did eat more of the panini than the turkey burger and almost left my whole portion on my plate. The poblano pepper on the burger was super hot and I had to take it off and the turkey was dry. The panini was good, just nothing extraordinary. Our waitress was quite a bit slower this visit and never checked in with us so while it wasn't quite as great as an overall experience as the first time, I still be back for those peppers!",

    "text": "I was happily surprised by Salut. Last week my friend won their instagram prize and asked me to come hang out for bottomless mimosas and NFL game-watching. Because I am me, I immediately peeked at the menu and was very excited by the variety of good they had to offer. In my head, I was already deciding on what to eat. However, once I got to Salut, my mind changed and I decided on the Chicken Pita. This was delicious. The pita was soft, and the fillings were super good. Extra garlic aioli was definitely a good decision. The fries on the side were seasoned well with rosemary and sea salt. We of course took advantage of bottomless mimosas. We told our server we liked the balance of champagne to orange juice, and she was happy we told her because other guests I guess had complained about the ratio. Whatever - they were just the right mix to be a little dangerous. When we were done with our meal I was craving some desert, and lo-and-behold THEY HAVE SMORES. Seriously the BEST idea ever and I was so so so happy with them. They totally hit the spot. All the people who served us through the day, including the manager (David) were great, helpful, and very fun. I will DEFINITELY be coming back to Salut for Sunday football and mimosas and I am looking forward to testing out other yummy dishes.",

    "text": "Went here with a Groupon for 2 craft cocktails and 2 burgers with Salut fries or Greek salad.  The craft cocktails were far too sweet for our taste and pretty small for the price - next time I'll stick with wine or beer.  The burgers were large and excellent with homemade buns.  My turkey burger  was meaty, juicy and full of flavor.  The burgers were so big we both took half home.  The Salut fries are regular fries with Parmesan and feta cheese plus a lemon vinaigrette which I felt made them somewhat soggy- I would have preferred plain fries.  The Greek salad was a Greek salad, enough said.  Parking was easy since the restaurant is in a strip mall on the edge of Tempe, unlike going to Mill Ave. I'd go back to try some of the nachos or a chef's platter with wine.  Definitely steer clear of the craft cocktails if sickly sweet isn't your thing.",

Higher standards regarding the food and drinks, the timing, the atmosphere and to me the most important....the service.  I'm in town visiting from Denver and will definitely be telling everyone what a great place Salut was when I get home. My sister and I went for brunch, and started with some bottomless mimosas.....best mimosas I have ever had. I wouldn't go into more detail but my sister would mock me seeing as I haven't stopped telling everyone how great they are. Perfect balance of sweet from the Prosecco and acidity from the orange juice. We then (upon our servers recommendation) ordered the \"hangover fries\" which were wonderful to start out with while we got to catch up.  I could go on and on about the food, and the mimosas but what TRULY made it an amazing dining experience was the service.  Forgive me for the spelling.... but Jean-Paul was incredible. Like I said, I have high standards when it comes to service and I am not easily impressed but he went above and beyond. He was knowledgeable on each and everything we asked, had great recommendations, was attentive without being over bearing, he truly made our brunch a better experience. If you do head over to Salut I HIGHLY suggest siting in the gentleman's section.",

Our server Dylan was super friendly and attentive and helpful.  Since we were there during happy hour, all the starters were $2 off.  And the Yelp app was great because I was able to get a glass of wine for $2!   (Mind you, it was a small amount in a too big glass, but for $2!)  The muscato was nice.  I don't usually drink but I couldn't pass on the price.        We had the 4 bruschetta for $13 and the choices I made were 2 \"Caprese Bruschetta\", a Sriracha BLT Bruschetta and a Fig Bruschetta.  The bruschetta bread did not seem grilled at all.  I think if they'd been lightly toasted it would have been better.  I didn't care for the Sriracha BLT one, and loved the flavors of the Fig one.  And Caprese, in any form is always a bit of heaven.  (and it being an appetizer, it was $2 off during the Happy Hour).    We also had the Bacon Chestnuts with honey!  Could have eaten a couple of dozen of those!       Betty got the BACON GRILLED CHEESE sandwich...(Apple wood smoked bacon and tomato between melted cheddar and provolone on honey butter toasted sourdough with garlic aioli.)   To my partner this was GREAT!  I had a taste and it reminded me of having a honey mustard flavor... not bad, but not what I was thinking for the description.  The SALUT fries that came with it were pretty darn good.  We always prefer shoestring fries and this was a wonderful twist on seasoning them.      My main meal was the bruschetta, but we and we also got a hummus platter that had pita bread, two kinds of hummus, carrots, celery and cucumber.  Even though the waiter said the garlic hummus was an old family recipe of the cook / or owner... it wasn't my style of hummus.  The other hummus was spicy and depending on what bite the heat varied.  Really, it could be me!      I would definitely check them out after looking at the online menu to see if it looks good to you.   We were really glad to have tried it and most likely go back!",

It was a perfect day to sit outside, and Salut has created a very cozy, comfortable, and inviting space on their patio.  Our service exceeded all expectations. Our server Keary was happy to help our indecisive group navigate both the food and cocktail menu, and her recommendations did not disappoint. We started with the wonderfully refreshing Skinny  Mojitos, and the Hummus Nachos, which were truly out of this world - a must try for anyone visiting this restaurant. We decided to share several of the appetizers and a salad vs. ordering entrees.  The menu is refreshing, offering a welcome break from the typical standard fare.  The Quinoa Fritters were phenomenal, and the Mediterranean Shrimp Tacos, Salut Fries, an Strawberry Salad were all delicious. We had to end with the S'mores, presented with a tiny tabletop grill- such a fun way to end our visit!! The owners and staff clearly have a passion for what they do and have created a happy, friendly environment. Pair that with the unique menu and flair for cool decor inside and out,  this spot will definitely keep us coming back for more!",

    "text": "I would have given 4 stars, because the bruschetta board that my friend and I shared as a late-evening supper was really quite good, but the staffing was a mess!  When we arrived there was no one at the host stand outside the front door, but when I popped my head in a server seated us on the near-empty patio at our request.  My friend went to use the restroom, and  the server asked if I'd like to start with waters, and even if we wanted lemon or cucumber in it.  But then the trouble started.  He came back with one water for me.  After my friend had been back at the table for a while and we'd decided what to order, a woman who appeared to be the manager stopped by and had the idea that we'd ordered drinks that were on the way.  I explained that we needed another water, and that we were ready to order the bruschetta board.  She said she'd put it in for us, and went on her way.  After quite a while a different server came up and introduced himself and said he'd be helping us.  We said that we'd ordered already and he said that he knew about the bruschetta and just wanted to know if we needed more drinks or anything else.  So we again said that we needed another water, and he asked if my friend wanted lemon, and she indicated that she did.  He shortly plopped down a glass of ice water with no lemon (or straw, as mine had).    In the meantime two other parties had been seated on the patio and had received their drinks.  After the second water was delivered we sat for quite a while and watched those parties receive their food.  We did receive one reassurance that our order would be out soon, but it was long enough later when our server reappeared that he sent someone else to check on it.  I think it took 45-50 minutes from when we sat down to when we received our food.    At first I thought that since we're at the start of a new academic year there was a lot of new staff.   But now I wonder if there were so many staff on duty that we got lost in the shuffle (I believe I saw all of the servers (4 or 5) come out to the patio at least twice, and there were only 4 tables with patrons.  Anyhow, after reading all of the reviews here, I'm inclined to give them another chance, because the bruschetta offerings were very delicious.",

    "text": "My boyfriend I came here with a Groupon one day after work. The place is very dimly lit and I wouldn't recommend sitting by the door which is where we were seated even though we had a reservation and the restaurant was not at all busy when I arrived there.   There is a dining room with more space but the bar area is a very tight space and our waiter was constantly having to step out of the way of people so that they could walk by our table.   So the food:  We both ordered the sriracha burger and that was probably a mistake on both our parts. I love spicy and my boyfriend can't handle as much spicy as I can but neither of us could really enjoy the burger because it was just way too spicy. When we took the sauce off though it was really good.   The fries were VERY good. We both preferred the regular fries to the Salut fries though. The Salut fries have an interesting sauce on them that I wasn't a fan of for two reasons: 1) They made the fries soggy and 2) They also had a real tangy greek flavor that I just couldn't enjoy with the fries.   We each ordered a drink because it came with our Groupon. My boyfriend got this delicious cocktail called the Lavender Lemon Fizz which was really good, the waiter said it was one of the more popular drinks and I can see why. I got the Peach Fuzz Fizz and it was pretty good but I definitely liked the Lavender drink better.   Overall I think I would got back but only with Groupon because their prices are a little steep for what they offer, I think you pay more for the Wine Bar atmosphere.",

Desert of s'mores to top it off were a perfect ended for the evening. Fun vibe, good food, awesome.",

    "text": "Two words sum up Salut Kitchen, fun and flavor! My boyfriend and I had an exceptional experience enjoying the service, food and music. Our server was Hannah, a genuinely kind person who was easy to talk with and had an ease about her that made for a great dining experience. Thanks Hannah! First, we enjoyed an appetizer of Hummus Nachos...yum!!! A small plate that packs a ton of flavor, and fresh flavor at that. Thanks to the outgoing and personable manager David, we found out the recipe for the hummus dates back into the history of owner's family. It is fantastic! For entrees I had the Beet Salad with goat cheese, golden beets, fresh greens, sliced apple, and walnuts. My boyfriend had the Pesto Alfredo garnished with a grilled lemon slice (so good squeezed on the pasta), and lightly toasted bread that as he stated \"perfectly complimented the pasta\". It all tasted fresh & delicious. Salut Kitchen knows how to pair flavors and they choose high quality ingredients. As vegetarians we were pleased with the options available on the menu. Of course more options are always welcome! If you do like eating meat, there is a good size menu for that too! To top off our dining experience we opted for the campfire S'mores! It was so much fun, we definitely felt childlike and playful. And needless to say it was a terrific dessert! Now, I have to give props to David as he chose the music for the night and honestly that is what got my boyfriend and I in the doors. It was old school, upbeat and fun. It totally gave off a great vibe! Thanks David! Last but not least my boyfriend and I took notice of the repurposed materials used to decorate and frame Salut Kitchen. Nicely done!  Thanks Salut Kitchen, Hannah, David and the talented chefs; you made our first visit to Tempe awesome!",

    "text": "First of all let me say that the staff there was very friendly. I think that the restaurant is great for people that are not gluten-free. Unless you just want salad and small portions of meat, that's pretty much the only gluten-free options they have. I got the steak it was actually very good. They have no gluten-free sides except greens and no substitutions for their sides that they had. There potatoes had gluten and everything else was regular pasta. So they offered spinach. I got my steak one side was mixed greens the other side was raw spinach. So basically a small 4 ounce steak with a bunch of greens. I sent the spinach back to have it sauteed because that many greens is not appetizing to me. The spinach was OK and I did not touch the greens because the waitress had suggested I get a salad on top of my entree because of the substitutions. So basically I had a bunch of salad. Again not for the gluten free. Very limited options. My husband got the burger and of course they have no gluten-free bun. Disappointing that it is listed as gluten-free options. I guess they did offer gluten-free graham crackers as substitution for their Smore's dessert. But that's it. I should've went to Picazzos",

I love the drinks, the food, the atmosphere and the staff! Me and my dog probably have a couple of photos on the board! Sometimes the music does tend to be loud but with a polite request it can be fixed! It's best for brunch. I love the bruschetta and the bottomless mimosas. I always bring my friends who are visiting from other states and I've never had anyone complain. There decor is recycled stuff and it adds a different charm to the place. Another thing that I love is that this place is never swarmed with rowdy asu students like other brunch places on Mill. I will definitely recommend this place!",

The eggs were supposed to be poached but they were overcooked, the biscuits were cold, and the hollandaise wasn't creamy and too sour. When we mentioned the hollandaise sauce they said they ran out of the store bought hollandaise sauce and had to make their own. Overall just another bad experience.

The decour of the place is beautiful and very well maintained, but as I walked in my boyfriend and I kinda didn't know what to do so we stood around waited to be greeted. We were sat by a super polite host who told us our server would be with us shortly. The place was not busy at all, we were 1 of 3 couples in the whole area, and you can bet it took the server SEVENTEEN (17) minutes to come greet us and offer us water and suggestions. I did time it because my boyfriend and I were about to walk out of the locale.   I ordered the specialty salmon and my boyfriend a burger. The salmon was lacking flavor and the side rice was nothing out of the ordinary. My boyfriend enjoyed the burger but he said it was nothing special.   I have to give it to them on the drinks. We had the specialty drink with absinthe in it and it was quite tasty! I would still recommend this place because the atmosphere is quite nice and their specialty drinks are delicious.   If they stepped up their customer service they would be amazing. Maybe it was because I was using a groupon? Regardless you should never treat potential guests poorly, it drives service away. I tipped 100% ($20) and even with the groupon my tab was $40. I promise you if the customer service was better and prompt I would a regular there. The place is nice!",

I also had a bite of the salmon with borocolini it was average, I ordered a wrap made with quinoa and hummus the idea was good behind the wrap, the warp itself was pretty unexciting. One thing that I didn't like is that I was told that the second Bittle of wine would be offered at 5 cent buy when I looked at my bill I was charged 15 dollars still for it.",

Bottom line, I am a huge fan and can't wait to bring friends here!   Staff/service:  All the staff was super friendly and helpful, and very approachable. It was pretty busy when we visited (5:00 PM on Friday) but the service was very quick and someone was always coming by to pick up our dishes or to make sure everything was good. The owner also came around and checked  on us which was nice to see. Our server, Stephen, was awesome. He knew alot about the menu and his suggestions were spot-on.  Food/wine: I am a vegetarian and we had many options to choose from. We had the hummus nachos, the caprese cabobs, ravioli, and the peppy dew peppers. All were so delicious!!  Loved the wine selection. Would love to see a Rose or Gruner on the menu though!  Happy hour: Can't beat 3-7 every day and the selection of happy hour items.",

For the appetizer, we had the hummus nachos, which had a unique, but delicious taste. My friend ended up getting the habanero vodka bolognese, but didn't seem to be a fan. I tried a bite of it and found this dish to be more of an acquired taste. As for the overall atmosphere of this place, it was a pretty typical bar. The lighting was really dim (a bit too dim) and the music they played that day was pretty old school, which I really enjoyed. The servers were really nice and provided quick service. I probably would not re-visit here since there aren't too many food options and it's a bit of a drive for me, but I definitely recommend the burger if you're in the Tempe area.",

We've had several bad service encounters, portions of the same hummus nachos appetizer have gotten smaller while the price has gone up.  I hate it when you take somebody new to your favorite restaurant and it's the worst service you've ever had. This weekend I brought my mom. It took about 7 minutes for someone to bring us water. By that point we already knew what we wanted, so we ordered. It took 20 minutes for the hummus nachos to come up. 4 single slices of cucumbers (yes, only 4) with a scoop of hummus on top for $10. Wow. The server did not bring our food and he never came to check on us. When we were done eating we waited about 15 minutes for the bill that never came. I walked up to him to hand him my card and ask him to run the bill right then.   He had a confused look on his face, then asked where we were sitting. I pointed. He said \"oh, I didn't see you there behind the pole\"  SERIOUSLY? You forget about your tables because it's behind a pole? He can't be surprised why he didn't get a tip when all he did was take our order at the very beginning.",

It's a great venue and random but, the women's restroom was really nice. It had a rustic feel with an awesome mirror! We walked in and were able to be seated immediately which is rare on a Sunday but a welcomed surprise. The patio area was also very nice but we opted to sit inside.  I wanted to love this place, I really did. I'd go back for drinks but that's about it. My hubs and I both ordered the chicken and waffles (our favorite) but it wasn't like we've had before. The menus clearly said chicken thighs which I missed because I was excited my fave dish was on the menu. Instead of focusing on the negative, I'll share my thoughts on what can be improved about this particular dish. A dash of seasoning goes a long way. Even salt and pepper will improve the taste. Don't fry it as hard, it was very moist but the skin fell all over when my plate hit the table.  My waffle was delicious and so were the eggs! $3 mimosas, awesome! Probably the best mimosa I've ever had and the price was right.",

I have had the cowboy omelet and it's just.. meh. The Sun Devil burger is pretty good - just again, depends on if it is cooked correctly or not.   The shining light is the Hangover Fries - in all their gluttonous glory. Nothing like chorizo gravy on fries - it is definitely worth it. Try it out.   Brunch is nice here with AYCD mimosas - but honestly, the staff always seems overwhelmed or under observant so it's pulling teeth to get more than a few. When you do get a good waiter - they are a gem. But I have been here and waited 25 mins before even being acknowledged. I tried to sit at the bar and same thing - just not paying too much attention to who is being seated.   They have a nice patio - which is great when the weather allows - and makes for a great brunch place.   I am on the fence - when everything is good.. it is good. When it's bad, it just is really bad. I like the bottomless mimosas - when they work out well. They are pretty well proportioned (not too sweet, although pre-mixed) and decent sized.",

    "text": "After a week of vacation in northern Arizona, we had one last night together and picked Salut because they had a good selection of vegetarian dishes for my husband and decent reviews overall; we hoped that the lower ratings were exceptions and not the norm.  Well, we were wrong. We made reservations just in case seating as an issue (it was a Friday night), but changed our request to outdoor seating because it was so incredibly noisy inside: it's our last night together as a group, we'd actually like to be able to talk. Although it was a little warm outside, the mist and fans made it bearable.  After being seated, we ordered beverages that were delivered quickly. When it came time to order, I was especially interested in the kabobs and asked our waitress if it was possible to get them without the green peppers (I cannot eat food that is even cooked with green peppers): she said she would check and let me know. Since she never returned, we assumed all was good. Well, we all know about assumptions!!  After waiting for our food, she starts to deliver our dishes...mine is the last she brings out...and it is loaded with green pepper!  When I point that out, she replies \"they couldn't do the dish without them\". So I guess she thought I was just asking for fun...despite the fact that I pointed out to her when I ordered that I could not eat any dish that even had green peppers anywhere near the food...it was not a matter where I can just \"pull them off\" and not eat them.  She acted surprised when I reminded her I just told her that when I ordered. I told her she could just take the plate away because I could not eat it and was not going to pay for something I couldn't eat. Since it took so long for our dishes to come out, I was not going to ask my dining companions to wait while I ordered something else...I could just stop somewhere on the way back to our hotel. The manager came out and apologized, saying that they could indeed prepare the dish without green peppers and asked if I would let them quickly prepare a replacement for me, to which I agreed. As he promised, my replacement dish came out much more quickly than the first; but by that point I was too hungry to complain about how charred the kabobs were. To be honest, the hummus was incredible as was the tzatziki sauce that was also on the plate; and I'm sure the kabobs would be tasty if they were normally prepared. I have to give the manager credit for taking over the situation and keeping the night from being a total disaster; but the other meals were not stellar enough for us to want to return when we're in the area again.",

After browsing through the menu I decided on the farmhouse omelet with ranch dusted potatoes. The omelet was filled with well seasoned and tender vegetables but the scrambled egg was overcooked and thus a little tough. I loved the potatoes. They were lightly crisp, perfectly tender on the inside and the ranch \"dust\" gave the potatoes a whole new dimension of flavor. I also had some of the hummus nachos which had smooth creamy hummus with crisp, slightly chewy pita triangles. The balsamic vinegar drizzle on top was a great touch.  Service was friendly and warm. Our server was spot on with refilling coffee and water.  It was chilly and a little rainy outside and while there are heaters outside they still weren't powerful enough to keep me feeling comfortable sitting outside. By the time we were finished with our meals my feet felt frozen.  I definitely want to come back with my pups but on a warmer day. Until next time, Salut!",

I've been there twice, with clients and both times my clients have loved, loved it. As a matter of fact, I'll be there on a monthly basis for client appointments. That's how much I like it. And so do they.   I recommend the Strawberry Fields salas with Chicken and their Avocado Hummus appetizer. Really, everything on their menu is DELICIOUS. I recommend this place.   This place is PRIMETIME!",

    "text": "Not an impressive experience. Food was solid, but service & policies were lacking.   Made a Happy Hour reservation for 6 co-workers.   First off, appetizers beat some of the drinks. Bartender was sloooooow and less than a dozen customers on-site when we ordered.Took 15 minutes to get 6 drinks that were ordered at once but brought out separately. Two of those drinks were draft beer! I'm a strong drinker and so my cocktail needed an extra shot of liquor. Took 10 minutes to get that single shot glass of liquor from a bottle. Ugh! Bartender & service was so lacking, 6 of us only ordered a single drink each....at happy hour.   Second, The waitress recommended a pasta dish that was too spicy for my colleague - who made it clear she was gun shy about spice. Guess what? It was too spicy for her to eat. She asked for a side of Alfredo sauce to tone it down & was served a single dipping size cup (like for fries!) to tone down a full bowl of spice. My colleague asked for more and offered to pay for a larger portion, but was advised the kitchen was not willing to make more due to some policy. She didn't eat the pasta, but paid full price at the end of the meal. That's a no for me.  Coupled with other spots of slow, inattentive service and a frustrating kitchen policy, that fully turned it to a negative tide for me. I won't return or recommend.",

But the first thing we noticed was the seating wasn't comfortable for my husband who is average height but felt the booths were so narrow he didn't fit comfortable. We then asked about the 1 cent bottomless mimosas but you have to buy 3 full priced (total of $18.00) mimosas before you can start getting the penny ones, when asked if they used fresh squeezed OJ we were told it was from concentrate, yuck! Not worth it at that price. Next we asked if they had any specialty coffees, the waiter said no and he didn't know what kind of coffee they use. And, FYI the coffee was bitter. My husband and I shared the chicken and waffles; the waffle was cool when it was brought out and we were given 2 hard lumps of butter to spread on it. The cinnamon butter would have been a nice touch if it was soft. The waffle didn't taste bad it just didn't have that nice  crispiness on the outside edges.  The fried chicken was just 2 uneventful chicken fingers.  Too many other places to go that do a better job, won't be back.",

The venue is nice and I like the feel of the patio and openness of the layout, but besides that, this place was lacking.  I tried a few of the red wines and some bruschetta, but nothing overwhelmed me with flavor and I actually didn't love the options of ingredients for toppings (I am a fan of Postino's Bruschetta, which may have ruined me).    On top of the food choices and tastes not impressing me, the service was strange to say the least.  It was a weekday night and the place was empty and when a group of us walked in, they asked us if we had a reservation like it was expected even though the entire restaurant was nearly empty.  Our waiter was friendly, but not totally attentive.  I wouldn't slam the place (maybe I went on a bad night), it seems like it is trying, but I just couldn't give it a raving review in good conscience, but it seems to have some upside.  Maybe I will give it another try sometime and hopefully update my review!",

He's friendly, very accommodating, great with communication, and has an incredible staff. Every person there seems happy to work there and the services is top notch! The food is delicious, I have always enjoyed everything I have tried/eaten there. When we hosted our party, it was raining non-stop and we had booked the patio outside, however, it was covered so wasn't too bad of an evening being outside (plus who doesn't love the rain in Arizona), and Craig and his staff went above and beyond to accommodate our group (there were about 50 of us). He also gave us complimentary dessert for putting up with the rain. Highly recommend and I know a lot of ASU staff members who either get Salut to cater or hold parties there. Love this place and thank you, Craig, for taking such great care of my team!",

From my first call, the team was excited to assist with the special event, set aside a large area of the patio, and even called to confirm before the day.   Once we arrived, we enjoyed amazing food, attentive service and wonderful ambiance. The drink menu is creative and the bottomless mimosas are a must. I had an omelet with fresh veggies and breakfast potatoes that rocked.   The servers were on point- never missing an empty glass, offering to do split checks and comfy with fun banter.

The rest of the food ordered was under seasoned but not terrible.  When taking my plate the bartender asks how it was.  I reply that it was pretty awful and he shrugs and walks away.  We ask for the check to go to a different restaurant to get edible food and, after paying, I comment that the dish was really bad and the bartender says, \"can't win them all.\"  Shitty, shitty service and shitty, shitty food.",

We ordered burgers, a chicken pita and pasta. I'd hope the $4 up charge for chicken would be worth but it was a very small portion. Regardless, it all came out great. Compliments to the chef. However our server Tyler is a little inexperienced and needs more training . We had a group of 6. We sat on the patio and weren't greeted for about 15-20 minutes. It didnt seem too busy inside or outside. It took one of us having to go inside to get a waiter.. We decided to check this place out because their restaurant was listed as a buy one get one entree on our Elite Restaurant App. We ask Tyler to confirm that this was in fact valid and he said \"No it is not\". We explained the restaurant is listed and he said okay I'll check for you. Didn't have the greatest attitude about it and returned with our drinks with no answer. We ask again. (Guess he forgot) He then comes back and confirms that we can use it here he said he just never heard about it before.. Well please explain why you would tell a customer NO, right off the bat if you're unsure.  We were glad we were able to use the offer. We didn't just come to be cheap and just order entrees. We ordered alcoholic beverages and an appetizer. The drinks were good but the margaritas were mostly ice, filled all the way up to the top. The appetizer did not come out before our food, they brought it out with all our entrees. Kind of defeats the purpose.. and at that point we didn't want it anymore. I wish everything was good after that but we had to ask for straws 3 times, waited 30 minutes for a 2nd Margarita, and when we received our bill instead of taking the 2nd entree off he took off a beverage. Goodness.. We felt bad having to keep correcting this kid but it's imperative to pay attention to details when working with paying customers. I'm very disappointed with our first impression. Like I said the food was great, we all enjoyed our meals, but the poor service really stuck out, and left us dissatisfied.",

The chicken was rubbery and chewy. You know that type of chicken we all had before - where your jaw gets tired from excessive chewing. Maybe they just had a rough night, but there are way too many restaurants to have to give salut a second chance.  You can try your luck. The meals are large and very affordable. Plus, using my code you can get $10 off your next ubereats delivery: eats-mbdvx",

Portions are a little small and food is overpriced.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying the service was great. Barbara is an attentive and caring server who works hard to please the customer. That being said...  My boyfriend and I came to Salut after recommendations from a mutual friend. In addition Yelp stated their happy hour was till 7pm. We arrived at 6:30 and ordered two glasses of Cab. It was good and looking over the menu I was excited. The food seemed promising and reasonably priced. When I asked if the bruschetta was on happy hour Barbara informed us that they changed their happy hour till 6:30. Everything was full price. We were fine with that.   I ordered the piquillo bruschetta. My boyfriend the Pepperonata sandwich. The bruschetta had a pepper spread, green bell peppers, onion, bacon and smoked Gouda. When it came out I was already disappointed. When I order bruschetta I expect the bread to be crunchy (I know what is bruschetta...I'm Italian). The bread wasn't even close to toasted. The \"pepper\" spread tasted like it was BBQ sauce out of a bottle mixed with ketchup and some pepper for a kick. The bell peppers, onion, and Gouda were diced. The bacon was diced as well and cold. It's as if the chef cut bread slapped BBQ sauce on it cut the veggies and let the bacon thaw out before placing it on the top. I'm not confident the bacon was anymore then thawed out. Cooked? Not sure. The piquillo bruschetta can beat described as a Red Baron frozen pizza, left outside of the freezer, thawed and served.   My boyfriends sandwich wasn't much better. He ate maybe a quarter of it and gave up. We both focused on the fries (the only saving grace to the meal).   While their wine and beer selection is appealing, their food is disappointing.  I could make it at home for even cheaper then 9 bucks.   Barbara needs to get picked up by a place like Postino. Her work ethic and eagerness to please the customer is better served in a place that puts effort into their food. This Postino wannabe has a pretty appealing menu with a disappointing end result.   Salut!!!!  UPDATE  I got food poisoning.  This was the last meal I ate.  I'm about 95% sure it is what caused me to get sick.",

For being extremely busy, the servers were really on top of everything and made the experience pleasant. We started with the Bacon Brussel Sprouts and the Caprese Salad. Both were good but we prefered the brussel sprouts. For dinner I had the seafood pasta and my husband had the short ribs. The pasta was great but the ribs were dry and had a weird after taste. We ended with the tiramisu. All it was lady fingers dipped in coffee, covered with cool whip for about  $60 a person they could have put a little more effort into it.  Overall the experience was average.",

    "text": "Granted, it was the Groupon that brought me in...and brought me back!  Was there Friday night (it was quite busy), and went again today (not so busy).    Everyone is still learning the ropes, but is very happy to try and make your experience the best you could have.  My husband and I sat at the bar and had the pleasure of speaking to Dustin, the sommelier of the establishment.  This \"kid\" is only 27, but has the knowledge of wine, beer, and \"specialty drinks\" (even Mr. Harry Mitchell who was sitting next to me was impressed), along with the pairing of food and drink.  My husband and I learned SO MUCH from Dustin this evening.    Finding out that Salut was dreamed up with every customer in mind (great happy hour prices on food and drink for the \"pop in and go\" kind of folks, to the folks that want to sit, eat, drink, and talk for HOURS about their experience) was a refreshing change from the \"norm.\"    I love the fact that this is a dog friendly establishment, which is something that I've only seen in Scottsdale.  Seeing so many items \"recycled/reused\" was definitely a plus in my eyes as well.  OH!  And I LOVED the hooks for hanging purses at the bar... simple wine bottle openers that had been \"turned into the wood\" leaving just the handle for a \"hook,\" VERY CLEVER!  As my husband and I were leaving, we kept talking about who we would like to bring to Salut, how we hope that they decide to offer \"wine courses\" as part of their experiences, and we wish them the absolute best!  We also look forward to making this establishment a \"regular\" date night location for us.    Lastly...things we've tried and LOVE: -Greek Fries -Peppadew Peppers -Hummus \"Nachos\" -Chef's Board -Wild Mushroom Bruschetta -The WIne Flight -Kentucky Rose -Lavender Lemon Fizz Thumbs up on EVERYTHING!  Can't wait to come back and try something different!",

My sister has been in the restaurant industry for about eight years now, so while she's really nice to all servers, she also has super high standards. So, it's not to be taken lightly that she thinks he was possibly the best server she's ever had. He was very knowledgeable, attentive, and personable, and makes killer recommendations (yes, you do want hangover fries with your grilled cheese). Even after we had moved on from food, he kept checking up on us.   Plus, the food! The food is good and even though it is on the pricey side for Tempe, in my opinion it is so worth it. Brunch was awesome and my sister is STILL talking about how perfect the bottomless mimosas are. They were really really good.   So, in summary: amazing service, good food, great drinks, a bit expensive, but worth it. Future request: make a coffee/espresso based cocktail (or two) for brunch and I would be so happy!",

My dining partner had bruschetta and enjoyed both pieces, also a generous portion.  In fact, all portion sizes were generous.  We both opted for pistachio crusted salmon, which was tasty.  Loved the asparagus as well.  Dessert was good, though they did run out of the dessert that was on the restaurant week menu (I didn't want to make a deal out of it, but that was a big part of the menu attraction, and I'm not big on many desserts).  They did give us our choice of other desserts and what we had (s'mores and cheesecake) were good.  The wine was also good.  The meal was good, don't get me wrong.  I just wasn't quite \"wowed\" though I'd likely come back and give it another go.",

One of their specials, buy a bottle of wine, get another for $5, turned out to be perfect for the group of us to share! They also offered a variety of \"bites\", which serve about 2-4, for $2 off. We ordered 4-5 of them and shared them around... I loved them all, but was an especially big fan of the Mac N Cheese bites and hummus nachos. (Don't expect the servings to be large - they're like tapas.) The service was very helpful and kind, and we also enjoyed the music that came in around 6!

    "text": "Okay, let me start by saying that we absolutely loved the atmosphere of this place. When we arrived my husband was ecstatic because he thought we had found our new spot. We also loved the staff, great people. However, we were super disappointed after that. My sister ordered the $18 bottomless mimosa, pricey, but she was willing to pay it for a great bottomless mimosa. Unfortunately, it was heavy on the orange juice, light on the champagne, and worst of all, it was warm. No bueno. She switched to the bacon Bloody Mary and was also quite disappointed with it. So was my hubby. Moving on to the food, it was good. But for the price we were paying we wanted great. They have no children's menu so I ended up ordering my 6 year old son a $13 meal which really irks me. But thankfully my husband enjoyed my son's meal more than his own. My sister had an ok benedict with the worst potatoes ever served alongside a meal. They were cold and hard tiny pieces of potato with no seasoning or love in them at all. I had the chicken pita which was good, but I could have gone to my neighborhood pita spot and had an ahhhmazing chicken pita for half the price. So that was our experience. Terrible over priced bar and so-so food WITH great people and potential.",

I went on a Sunday and was expecting to be able to watch my football game but they had only one game on and when I asked them to put the Steelers game on they said that they could not do it. I suppose it's because they do not have the NFL ticket so that would have been nice if they had it. I am willing to try the place again and maybe go for dinner.",

    "text": "Please don't order the panini- any of them. We met some friends for brunch this past Sunday and the three girls each got different paninis while the guys got omelets. I got the veggie which was supposed to have egg, spinach, onion, tomato, and a garlic aioli.  It did, but barely. When it arrived, I opened it up on my plate and everybody gasped- there was about a teaspoon sized dollop of egg, 3 spinach sprigs, a couple of pieces of diced tomato and onion. Zero garlic aioli. There was a little more egg on the other half, but the rest of the ingredients were the same level of barely there. I showed our server when he came back and he was mortified and brought me a huge plate of scrambled eggs to add to the sandwich. In the meantime, the other girls had realized the same thing was happening on their paninis so we ended up sharing the extra egg to try and build some kind of substance.  The boys said their omelets were decent, but nothing to rave about. Also, they charge $1.50 extra for a tiny bowl of fruit- seriously, about 3 grapes and a couple pieces of melon. The bill for my husband and I, including a bacon bloody mary and one of their Mules was $47.50...pretty ridiculous considering there couldn't have been more than $3 worth of ingredients on my sandwich.  In the restaurants defense, we saw dishes go past that looked really good. Maybe go for the waffles or another big breakfast dish because those all seemed legit. I don't know why they even have paninis on the menu since they clearly don't want to make any kind of effort with them.",

The Sriracha burger was great. Not too spicy, caramelized onions, wonderful bread & tender, well prepared burger. The waitress was very sweet & helpful. She mentioned this is a new menu & I have to say I'm all for it. The prices are a little steep, but for something so well done, how can you haggle?! We can't wait to go back and try the tapas too. Other tables ordered them & they looked amazing. Overall, it was awesome. I can't wait to go again & recommend it to friends.",

    "text": "I bought an Amazon local deal a while back, which expired...but I had the paid value to use, so the BF and I stopped in for lunch on our way back from the Botanical Gardens.  The decor was great!  Really loved the patio.  Lots of shade.  A+ service.  Granted, there weren't many customers since we got there right at 11am.  Still the guy that waited on us was very friendly and knowledgeable.  I had a glass of their house Cabernet which was $5.  Tasted great, but I had the worst....I mean, the WORST wine headache I've ever had in my entire life a couple hours later.  It lingered until after I woke the next morning.  Ugh.  I told our server I wanted the Hummus Nachos for my entree.  The server said \"They're actually pretty filling!\"  Hmmm.  That should have been a red flag.  I'll eat an appetizer for my meal quite often.  Anyway, I had also seen on the menu that you could get cucumber instead of Pita for a GF option.  Although I'm not GF, I do love cucumber with my hummus so I asked if I could have half cucumber, half pita.  \"No problem\" he said.  The BF ordered some burger with their Salut Fries.  So, 10 minutes later, out comes our food.  The BF's burger and fries looked great!  Best burger he's had in a really long time, he tells me later.  As for my hummus nachos.  3 pita triangles, 3 small, thin slices of cucumber, each with a scoop of hummus, some diced red onion, and crumbled feta, and pomegranate seeds sprinkled on top, with a balsamic drizzle.  Now his \"They're actually quite filling\" comment made a lot more sense.  So, they tasted great, don't get me wrong.  The ones made with pita were great.  I could smash the hummus down to cover the pita, and dip it into the additional balsamic drizzle on my plate.  Delish.  The ones made with cucumber, well, the cucumber was sliced so thin, I could hardly pick them up, as they could not support the weight of the the hummus.  It really just tasted like I was eating a big spoonful of hummus.  This was $9?  Well, now I know for next time.  What really surprised me was when I got the bill, I was charged and extra $1 for those 3 ridiculously small slices of cucumber.  Whaaat?  At Pita Jungle you get almost an entire sliced up cucumber for a dollar, and you still get your pita too!  I ended up eating half of the BF's fries, which were good, but soaked in oil and garlic.  As if fries aren't greasy enough to start.  I'll go again, since my BF loved his burger so much, but I won't get the house cab, and I won't was my money on those nachos.",

The wait staff while friendly could not take a hint and just let us eat, but more about that later.  The food, we ordered the sriracha blt bruschetta and it was 2 pieces of un-toasted bland french loaf with some lettuce and BACON BITS!!! It is listed as bacon but trust me it's bac'os, additionally not spicy at all and you could not taste sriracha.  Drinks were expensive which i am ok with IF they are good, moscow mule they served, meh. Sandwiches for main course again nothing to write home about and the \"famous\" salut fries were just too much.  Back to the wait staff, initially the girl who was serving us was friendly but then took forever to come back. Then towards the end there was another guy that just would not shut up and kept going on and on about the smores.  I was there with my coworker ... we don't want smores, as we went to prom about 20 years ago.The wait staff was either really overly nice or non attentive, we had 2 or 3 servers that evening and no explanation as to why this was happening.  We were seated near the back area by the bar and entrance to the kitchen, we saw some fries drop on the ground. One of the employees said something about it then proceed to pick them up off the ground with his hands.  Now highly unlikely that he was preparing or even touching my food but, get a broom.  It was just one thing after another.  Not a bad place just off the mark.  Please get rid of the bacon bits and please don't try and reply to say that was real bacon.  I would not come back here.",

    "text": "Suffering from a late night craving for something sweet, S'mores in particular. I found a article that said this was one of the top 5 places for S'mores in Phoenix. I haven't tried the other 4 places. But so far this one gets my vote for the best. What makes it so good is you, you actually get to make the S'mores right at your table. The server brings you a plate with Hershey's chocolate, marshmallows, and graham cracker. And a little tiny flame burning stove to roast the marshmallows on! The only problem I see is if a couple a drunk people act all crazy once they order that dessert. I could easily see a drunk person throwing a burning marshmallow on another person.  We didn't get a chance to try any of the entrees there. We ate somewhere else earlier but we was craving something sweet and this did not disappoint. I will for sure go there again just for the dessert. The menu also looked like they had some good food as well.",

Tyler was our server and he was awesome - very friendly and helpful with the menu. The food was great, Mac and cheese bites, quinoa fritters, bacon wrapped water chestnuts.... The only criticism I have is portion sizes. The appetizers were very small- had I paid full price I would have been very disappointed.",

We came straight from the airport after picking up my two aunts who are visiting for the week, there were four adults and our two kids (ages 5 and 3). I had made a reservation, but it wasn't super busy so we probably didn't need one, at least not last night (a Friday). We sat out on the beautiful patio and were served by Tyler who was just wonderful, and really hit it off with my 5 year old in particular, as he listened intently to her never ending conversation. He also busted out a few good one liners throughout our time and he was just incredibly friendly and helpful. The general manager also paid us a few visits and chatted up with everyone, paying extra attention to our kids and striking up conversation. It is just a really nice and friendly, laid back atmosphere (but not laid back service!). As for the food, the mules were phenomenal and a nice spin from a traditional Moscow Mule (between us we had 3 different ones) and the food was perfect. We ordered several apps/tapas and bruschetta. My very picky, Macaroni and cheese only, daughter went through two rounds of the mushroom ravioli, and my other daughter favored the pesto bruschetta and macaroni and cheese bites (also one of my favorites). If we had more room we would have ordered more hummus nachos for sure, but we were full between the food, drinks and dessert (self toasted s'mores and dreamsicle cheesecake - yum!). We will be back on a Tuesday for the $20 deal for hummus nachos and a flight - I really want more of those 'nachos'!",

I'm a firm believer that you can always judge a restaurant by the condition of their bathroom. Not only was the bathroom well kept, but it was one of cooler bathrooms in Scottsdale. The decor of the place was warm and they had a huge outdoor patio area. If you're in and around Tempe and looking for a laid back place to grab great cocktails, wine, beer or delicious food, look no further. I'll be back for their brunch next weekend.",

    "text": "I have been on the hunt for a decent breakfast/brunch place in the greater Phoenix area ever since moving to this megalopolis. Unfortunately, most places serve the standard fare that never excites or inspires. For mediocre omelettes, eggs, and potatoes, I can cook at home (ashamedly, I still haven't mastered the nuances of the American breakfast to my liking). But now that Salut is serving brunch (and this is a recent development), I consider dining here for that late lazy Sunday calorie-bomb a real treat!  I sniffed out this joint through New Times' Chow Bella blog and couldn't get the imagery of its menu items out of my head. Oreo pancakes? For reals? Cinnamon Toast Crunch chicken and waffles? Strange and subtle twists on the traditional breakfast appear to be afoot. With a pumped up notion of myself, I finally trotted this place out to my broheimers after failing miserably in the past to provide impressive local brunchy options. Salut did not disappoint! We had a wonderful dining experience that is sure to repeat itself the next time we return.  Amongst our samplings at the table we had: 1) the aforementioned Cinnamon Toast Crunch chicken and waffles; 2) the chorizo gravy eggs benedict; and 3) the salami, cheddar, bacon and egg panini. I couldn't taste the Cinnamon Toast Crunch that prominently in my precious shared bite of my dining neighbor's dish, but he was apparently a big fan. I love this concept, however, so I will order it one of these days. My one bite of the chorizo eggs benedict seemed appropriately creamy and I noted some Southwestern spice notes, but I considered it a tad undersalted/underseasoned. My breakfast panini with salami and cheddar was pretty much spot on, though, so I was a happy camper.  A few more notes, however. I'm a big hot sauce fan (especially with eggs) and was disappointed in their selection here when I asked. I was told they only had sriracha and Frank's available. Any restaurant that serves eggs oughta have an appropriate pepper sauce available (since they serve Bloody Marys here amongst the other fancy cocktails, one would hope that have Tabasco behind the bar). Admittedly, I'm so much of a hot sauce snob that I think for eggy dishes, green (jalapeno) Tabasco should be de rigueur.  At any rate, the inventive brunch menu, the ambience, the reasonable price range and the attentive service compel me to give this place five stars. There's alwas some room for improvement, but this is an original, contemporary restaurant/bar concept that I will happily introduce to other friends as I work my way through their other menu items and meal selections. Oh, and cocktails, there's always the cocktails.",

Even though I had my eyes set on hummus and wine, we had a great brunch option.  My friend got chicken and waffles, but the chicken was crusted with Cinnamon.  It was exceptional from the one piece that I tried.  I usually am not a big fan of chicken and waffles.  I got Eggs Benedict, and it was the best Eggs Benedict that I have ever had.  The key ingredient is some sort of tartiness with lime or lemon that gave a zesty flavor.  I wanted more, and I will have to make a trip back here to use my expiring Groupon.",

The waiter and rest of the staff i met were very kind and I watched as the waiter typed in my order so I don't think the blame was on him.

The food was actually decent, and I wish I could have had some wine with it.  I could see how it could have went well together.  However, I was not going to pay a cent more than I needed to satiate my hunger at this point.    I will say though that there was a piece of lint/animal hair in the hummus nacho plate and there were a couple of flies that we couldn't get rid of so I have to say that I'm not sure about the cleanliness of the establishment.  The service was great, but its such a shame that the manager in charge at the time was so unreasonable about the Groupon deal.  Their hours are so limited during the week so really you have about an hour window to use this for dinner unless you want to eat late.

    "text": "Meh, there are better places to get your Sunday brunch on.   I went here (for the first time) with a group of girl friend's for the Sunday Brunch that they serve, and as a group, we left disappointed. We were informed that they were completely out of their benedicts because something was wrong with their \"egg poacher\". I'm still left wondering how their pot of boiling water was broken in the kitchen. Between the seven of us we ordered the hummus nachos, the bacon grilled cheese, the skillet, the grilled chicken pita, one of the burgers and the salmon avocado. The hummus nachos arrived first, and even though every where online, on the menu, and on giant posters on their walls the nachos were depicted with five pieces, ours arrived with only four. The Salmon also arrived completely different than pictured or described on the menu. On the menu it says it's on a bed of seasoned arugula, mine arrived on a huge spinach and arugula salad that was mostly greenery. I tried the salmon and it was WAY over done and completely dry, it had the consistency of what I imagine cat food would have. I called the server over and asked for it to be remade, she told me that the salmon was all precooked and that the wait for a fresh piece would be way to long. I've cooked salmon many times and if they actually have fresh salmon in the kitchen it shouldn't take more than about 7 minutes to make a fresh piece that's done correctly. But I didn't want to play around with a kitchen that clearly couldn't cook salmon and was unable to poach an egg so I switched my order to the bacon grilled cheese because it seemed simple enough and hard to mess up, plus two of my friends were already eating it and said that it was pretty good. My sandwich finally arrived and was actually delicious! I was commenting on it and the two friend's that had the same sandwich asked if there was a tomato on my sandwich. There was, and it was delicious. Turns out their sandwich was delivered not only without tomato but also without the garlic aioli that mine came with. They tried mine, called the server over, pointed out the mistake with their sandwich and got it taken off the bill. That's three kitchen mistakes so far if you're counting, plus the disappointment in their inability to simply poach an egg. Service was slow, it was hard to order drinks. The one saving grace was that our server was able to split the bill correctly and did correct the mistakes by removing the one sandwich from the bill and getting my replacement order in quickly.   All though the bacon grilled cheese (when made correctly) and the bloody mary were both delicious, I would go else where for my dining options in the future. If you're going to pay for service and a meal out, it might as well be a 5 star experience.",

Maybe they ran out of ingredients? The vegetable one, which was supposed to have vegetables on it, had what seemed like less than an egg, one slice of tomato, 3 leaves of wilted spinach and some red onion. It was ALL greasy bread with no flavor (nothing really was inside of it). All that for $10. The service was good, but with so many other options in the area, why waste your hunger?",

The server was speed talking, there were too many specials she recited to us the we all tuned out. The drinks weren't good and the food boring. I won't go back.

    "text": "On a beautiful Saturday afternoon, I decided to head to Salut after participating on the MS walk since it was close by.  We decided to seat outside on the patio and it was nice.  Being so close to the University, I expected the place to be a little more busy and more livelier, but it was slow, calm, and relaxing.  I ordered the Breakfast Nachos - pita chips with hummus, bacon, and egg whites.  My bf ordered the bacon beer & chorizo. We were pretty hungry so I expected a good portion of food.  It's practically commonplace to be served breakfast food in generous portions - enough for two people per entree (or so I thought).    Our server starts heading over with two plates in her hand and they looked like appetizers for a table - Didn't expect that the plates were for us, she delivers the food at our table.  I look at my plate and there are FIVE (5) triangle shaped pita chips with a tablespoon of hummus, 2 bacon bits, and 3 scraps of egg whites per chip.  Is this for real?  I normally need a doggy bag and I normally share with my bf too.  To my bf, I pretty much said \"Sorry, I can't share with you this time.\"   His entree was pretty sad looking too.  Two poached eggs, a small size of breakfast potatoes and where's the bacon?!  We had a water boy who was really prompt at making sure our cups were always refilled and plates were picked up.  He is so good that when I ate the last pita chip, I noticed there was small bacon bits that I wanted to pick up with my finger and eat from my plate, but he was in my face in 2 seconds picking it up.  He picked up my plate before I can get to it.    Right when he picked it up, he saw my one finger motioning to the plate, but it was too late.  Then he asked, \"Are you done with that plate?\"  By that time, I'm thinking, \"Well, obviously not because you saw my one finger move toward my plate - but it would be so embarrassing to tell him no for just two bacon bits!\" So I proceeded to say, \"Yes, I am done.\"    When we got our check, we spent more than I expected = $25.  Don't you hate it when you feel the last thing that will make you feel like you are done eating is eating that last piece of rice, piece of bread, piece of bacon bit was taken away from you??! I hate it.   Salut, you owe me 2 bacon bits!",

    "text": "Such an amazing lunch!  Great company, delicious food, a fun waitress with a spot of green hair, and a deliciously smooth mule --- what more could a girl possibly want?  As soon as we walked in, we were seated by the charismatic and ever-patient Keary.  This girl is amazebeans!  She was sass and class and had great recommendations for food and booze.  Since everybody's favorite ginger couldn't make it, I love you Melodie C., I got myself an Oh Honey Mule [as per Keary's suggestion] in a shiny copper mug/  After that, it was a whirlwind of laughter, cheer, and a lot of foodie pictures being taken.  Those Hummus Nachos though... oh man!  The deliciously crisp pita with a soft chewy middle with a generous scoop of hummus, a splash of balsamic sauce, and topped with red onions, pomegranate seeds, and feta was a delicious bite!  I could just order two of those platters myself and eat it as a meal.  But hey, we're sensible adults so we're going to have a sensible lunch!  I had The Brie Hive and that sandwich was keeping my tastebuds happy.  The Brie Hive was salty-sweet goodness with prosciutto ham, brie [duh], granny smith apple slices, arugula, garlic aioli, and honey butter in between two grilled pieces of sourdough.  Eating that in between bites of the Salut Fries where the citrus vinaigrette helped cut through the occasional bites of too much saltiness from the ham or too much honey butter richness made for a perfectly balanced meal.  It was a rich sandwich though so I had to box it for later.  It strikes me as something that will be just as amazing right out of the fridge.  Overall I had an extremely satisfying lunch where we were introduced to the assistant manager Nicholas and one of the owners David.  This place really has it all:  Excellent service [thanks again, Keary!], higher-ups that really care about their customers, delicious food, and a great ambiance and vibe.  It's all dark wood, metal accents, and sleek lines. Will definitely be back [especially with the coupon cards for free Hummus Nachos]!",

This is a must have while your there, you wont be disappointed.  Afterwards we had their wild mushroom ravioli followed by quinoa fritters.  To pair with this we had a wonderful white wine selected from the reserve list.  This place is great for watching the game, casual meet up or first date.

We sat outside and the atmosphere was nice-- felt like a legit happy hour kind of place if you know what I mean. Despite being mostly empty the service was surprisingly slow. The service was friendly and they offered me a couple of samples of beer since I was unsure about their offerings. I ordered the Applewood grilled chicken sandwich with the Salut fries (like Greek fries - feta cheese and oil). That took 20-30 minutes to come out. I asked for a place setting (I arrived after my friends) and that took another 5 minutes. Everything we asked for including the checks and take out boxes took much longer than it should have since there really wasn't much going on here. The chicken sandwich was overcooked, dry, and pretty much tasteless, but the fries were seriously awesome. I mean, I might even put up with the bad service again just for the fries. Nah, I'll probably order take out and order an hour ahead...",

When the food finally did come out my eggs were so cold the yolks had coagulated and had a skin on them, and they were cooked wrong. The saving grace of this entire situation was that the manager cane over and had half of the entire meal comped and he explained the kitchen was backed up but it was slow? I think Victoria P forgot to place our order. I've been here before without any issues but I've always sat at the bar and from now on if I ever come back.",

It's been so long now that I can't review any of the specifics, but we had 12-15 people and received excellent service.  Fast forward to a few weeks ago and I wanted to have a farewell dinner with a co-worker and it needed to be near campus. I remembered Salut and she agreed with the menu. We arrived too late to enjoy the happy hour, but our waiter was really helpful in suggesting which wines to try and brought me samples of a few.  I had the grilled chicken pita with the mediterranean side salad. They were both delicious although the pita wasn't as healthy as I originally thought (a little on the greasy side due to the roasted/grilled vegetables), but it tasted great and was a large portion.  It wasn't busy when we were there (~7:30 on a Wednesday night), but even  still I thought the service was exceptional.  Icing on the cake? I was in Phoenix on business and my company requires receipts for expenses over $25 in order to be reimbursed. Well, I spent $34 that evening (with tip and one of the more expensive wines) and neglected to take a copy of the receipt. On a long shot, I contacted them through the generic form on their website and received a copy of the receipt within a few hours. Amazing customer service! Especially considering my visit was 2 weeks ago.  The patio looks great and I can't wait to go back to enjoy it!",

    "text": "Salut -- aka \"greetings\" or as I like to think of it, \"cheers!\" This place will definitely have you clinking glasses together and saying \"salut!\"   The place is not where you'd expect it to be, but definitely a gem. I, for one, absolutely LOVED it here! The ambiance is very relaxed yet friendly and welcoming. (I hate to name drop/compare it to another restaurant, but walking in definitely reminded me a bit of OHSO or The Vig -- although being compared to two great places isn't a bad thing, right?) I love that it has a dog-friendly patio with plenty of comfy seating (if you're lucky enough to get a booth), and if you can't rip yourself away from the game for a few hours (or coming in to watch a game), there are TVs both inside and on the patio.   Started off the evening with the Lavender Lemon Fizz -- oh.em.gee! I've had Lavender added to coffee before which was divine, but this just took me to a whole 'nother level. It was perfectly sweet with a subtle hint of lavender and refreshing lemony flavor. (side note: you cannot taste the alcohol in this drink, so pace yourself -- 'cause you'll be drinking and then all of a sudden, BAM! Gotta call an Uber).   As far as food, we ordered Truffle Fries to start (recommended by our amazing server, whose name started with a \"C\" but I can't remember it. *sorry*). They were extremely flavorful and seasoned just right, with the right amount of \"crisp\" to them. I recommend ordering some, for real though. And then for my main course, I opted for the Quinoa Bowl with chicken -- mouthwateringly delicious, satisfying and filling; but not that \"omg I ate too much\" feeling, it was just right. My friend got the Salut Burger, which, honestly, it took every ounce of strength in my body to not jump across the table and devour that burger... it looked and smelled so good. Next time I'll get a burger, for sure. Yes, there will definitely be a next time... and probably many more times after that. All in all, it was a great evening! Thanks, Salut! Oh, and p.s. please open more locations across the valley.",

Our table ordered the biscuits and gravy, chicken and waffle ,omelette and Mac n cheese bites . For the most part everyone enjoyed their food I just had to have mine warmed up. Also, the Mac n cheese bites weren't cheesy and crispy like you would expect them to be. Food was ok but our server was awesome. Super attentive and accommodating. We also got the smore kit where they give you a mini bonfire! Go here for a chill quiet vibe and a quick bite.",

Of course, you cannot sit outside without a delicious cocktail and they have plenty of them including the delightfully refreshing Lavender Lemon Fizz. Their craft cocktails are a bit pricey so go for happy hour when you get $2.00 off. In addition to cocktails, I believe all of their adult beverages were on happy hour. My colleague ordered the Cool Mule which he enjoyed and for a nonalcoholic option, my other colleague ordered a Strawberry, Raspberry Lemonade which was served in a tall, robust glass.   For food, we only ordered an appetizer but it was delicious! We ordered the smaller which came with Salut Fries, 3 Mac & Cheese Balls, 3 Hummus & Pita chips and the Caprese Salad (2 tomatoes and 2 pieces of mozzarella).   Lastly, the staff were super friendly and helpful with recommendations. The only bit of criticism is that our drinks were slow to come to the table, regardless of alcoholic or not.   Overall, great place! I would like to go again.",

Appetizers - 2 misses Pork wings were the best but nothing to write home about or order a second time.  Humus bland and nothing special. Worth $3 on a regular menu Mac bites = blah and not worthy of being on a $44 menu  Entree - 2 misses Salmon meal was over cooked  Gnocchi was the best offering by far.  Filet mignon was ok but the served it with a really bad sauce.  Desert - 2 misses S'mores I saw another table call the manager over to complain and we did not order it.  The peach sorbet - it home made, but lacked pizzazz of a restaurant week three course meal finisher.  The other desert was their best, but was still a $4-5 desert.   While good I can not remember what it was really so enough said there.   They were not busy but the food was backed up. 75% empty building with no one at the bar.   Maybe 1 person.   While the restaurant was not busy the manager on duty could still not find time to stop and ask how the food was even during restaurant week.  There were 2 prices for restaurant week in the valley ($33 and $44). Their food was almost worthy of the $33 price, but they went with $44.   I had heard good things of this place but food did not pan out very well. The drinks were good. I had a thyme fig  Martini that was good and I do recommend it. That is why there are 2 stars on my visit.   Drinks = 4 star. Food  = 1-2 stars. Service = 2",

My date's food was tasty, but portion was small and the chicken was very dry. Overall: patio was pretty nice, service was decent, food was overpriced and not very tasty. Drink prices were high too. This may be a place worth visiting during happy hour, but not dinner time.",

The hummus nachos were insanely good, the quinoa fritters were extremely unique, and the pesto Alfredo was hands down the best pasta I have ever had. My only complaint is that I was too full to get dessert haha. Seriously, Tempe is lacking on restaurants with good quality food and I can't believe it took me this long to find Salut. I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "We had dinner here tonight with friends and were not disappointed in our food or with the service.  Since we bought the groupon, the two person deal included two craft drinks, two entrees (any of the burgers or entrees under $17) and one dessert to share.  Our friends had their own groupon, so it was nice to sample several different drinks and entrees.    The drinks we sampled included the cucumber mule, the lavender and lemon fizz, the peach fuzz fizz, and the prohibition manhattan.  The lavender and lemon fizz was definitely the lightest of all the drinks; the manhattan was the strongest.  My husband liked the manhattan but couldn't finish his peach fuzz.  Our friend and I were a fan of the lavender and lemon fizz (i particularly enjoyed how similar it is to real lavendar lemonade) but she especially liked the cucumber mule because it came in a copper mug that made it just that more authentic in taste.  Overall the drinks seemed well made with quality spirits.   We really liked the glasses and our waiter told us most of the restaurant's decor and furniture was made of reclaimed products.  All of our glasses were made from old alcohol bottles, which I really liked.  The atmosphere was intimate, the lighting was low, and the music was chill.  I fell like the booth we were in was a little tight and cramped - I would ask for a table next time.   Our friends order an appetizer while we waited for our entrees: the prosciutto bruschetta was good but our friends felt the drizzled honey was a little overpowering.  Personally I liked the little sweetness to balance out the salty prosciutto and tart granny smith apples.  I barely tasted the blue cheese smear and didn't even notice the almond - both which are pluses for me because I'm not a fan of blue cheese.  Our entrees came out and we were pretty happy with our individual choices.  My husband ordered the Italian panini with the greek fries - not sure what special spices they put in the fries, but those were very addicting.  Next time I'm ordering a plate of those for myself - no sharing!  The panini was very good - just the right amount of saltiness.   On the recommendation of our waiter I had the piquillo ravioli with chicken. I think it was a very good choice - it wasn't too spicy and the ravioli is stuffed with herbs, roasted corn, and parmesan.  The sauce was made of the piquillo peppers, wild mushrooms, and toasted pine nuts - similar to a chunky, roasted pepper sauce.  They placed grilled chicken on top of the ravioli, but I think I would consider it a win even without extra protein.  It came with two crostini that I thoroughly enjoyed sopping up the sauce with.   Our friends had the pistachio encrusted salmon and the grilled chicken panini - according to them they both enjoyed their dishes.  The salmon came on a bed of lemony orzo and brocolini - I enjoyed orzo but felt the brocolini was a little bland and lacked flavor.    We all finished with two orders of the s'mores - thoroughly entertaining as we caught our marshmallows on fire!  S'mores are a little too sweet for me, but it's campy fun (see what I did there)?  All in all a good time.  Our waiter was even nice enough to give us a free appetizer coupon on the way out - yay!  We look forward to stopping by soon!",

They were not afraid however, of the other dog on the patio, who got a lot of attention from the staff. Hmm. They did supply ice water and treats for the dogs which was thoughtful. After getting our check it took forever for the waitress to come get our credit cards, even though there was only one other table of customers on the patio.

Delish cooked perfectly... the chicken was still moist and the veggies were perfectly charred and the hummas was the best I have ever had...  my friends split the chicken pita and strawberry fields salad and raved about both.  we had friendly conversation with the lovely couple and 4 legged baby at the  table next to us and then we were surprised with tabletop s'mores courtesy of the same couple. Upon leaving found out he was the owner.. Thank you again...  We thoroughly enjoyed everything we had and look forward to coming back.",

She was really helpful, honest and her enthusiasm about how great certain items were, really helped steer us in the right direction and and made me really excited to try everything.   Appetizers: pita nachos- loved how crispy and chewy the pita was.  fig bruschetta - my favorite appetizer. Perfect balance of flavor. Creamy, salty and a little sweet. mushroom bruschetta- really good, but the fig was so amazing I would rather get all fig next time.   Entrees: Filet with chimichurri and avocado horseradish aioli- this was amazing. The filet was grilled perfectly medium rare with great smoked grill flavor. The sauces were both amazing too.  Chicken Kabob- I didn't try it but heard it was great.  Kids mac and cheese- loved this. My favorite mac and cheese I've had in a long time.   Dessert:  limoncello with berries- I loved this too! The berry mix had perfectly sweet blackberries and blueberries. S'mores- so much fun for our 6 year old to make that we had to join in too :)  Wine- bought 2 bottles: Calina Carmenere- I usually drink Pinot noir, but I am glad I tried this. Smooth, not bitter and a little lighter than Pinot.  We also got a bottle of Moscato. I'm not a huge fan of Moscato, but this one was not sickly syrupy sweet and I could drink it.",

The waitress explained they had some work done on the a/c the day before but something was wrong.  The thermostat was at 86.  I was there at about 1:45 and they were switching from the brunch to the dinner menu and I was told it would be about 15 minutes before they could cook.  Who knows why?? Thirty minutes later I asked what was happening and was told another few minutes.  Another five or so minutes and we were finally able to order.  Please advertise that you don't cook at certain hours so people don't have the expectation of being able to order  and eat when they arrive!! Our waitress was new and she was very nice.  We had several different bruschetta that were all  delicious, which is why I was willing to give three stars.  Been there-done that- won't be back",

It was pretty pricey and not very busy so a group happy hour with cheaper prices may be the way to go.   I started with the quinoa fritters - basically fried balls of heaven. Take quinoa and mix it with havarti and red onion and top with a red pepper emulsion and fried, sliced crimini mushrooms. They were delicious!  We split the burger and while it was good it was nothing spectacular. The side of fries was not friendly to my taste buds, they were covered in feta and lemon juice... Not tasty.   While I was there I noticed the daily drink specials on the wall along with some awesome happy hour specials. They have free wifi and a dog friendly patio. May not be in my go to lunch spot but I would put it in rotation for happy hour in Tempe.",

The drinks are not cheap, but a bottomless Mimosa is a little under $20.  On this particular visit I was disappointed in the slow service and the cold food.  That is a bad combo.  I don't mind waiting for my food, but it better be because they are waiting for it to be made, not made waiting for the server.  Hard to make a positive review with cold food.  The drinks took a long time too so it was not isolated.  Past visits were better in this regard though.  I give 3 stars instead of 2 because of past positive visits, and for the cool patio dog policy.",

    "text": "I've been a fan of Salut Kitchen Bar in Tempe since it opened two and a half years ago. The restaurant has a great central location in the Valley, it serves up delicious food and cocktails, it has an expansive wine selection and great deals on bottles, it has a huge dog-friendly patio with sports televisions, the servers always seem like they actually care about you, and the bar and indoor service is friendly and relaxed. I headed there to check out some of their new fall menu items, and like always, I left with a fully, happy stomach.  My friend and I started with their Salut Sampler ($19), which gave us a taste of some of the restaurant's most popular appetizers - and they're all vegetarian! The hummus nachos were tasty, as always, with crispy pita chips topped with homemade hummus, red onion, feta, pomegranate seeds and a balsamic reduction. They're innovative bites that have remained a restaurant favorite.  The caprese salad in the sampler came with thick chunks of mozzarella and tomato slices, while the salut fries are coated with a seasoned herb blend and topped with a feta parmesan mix - an elevated fry option.  My favorite part of the sampler was a new menu item, the quinoa fritters. These balls of heaven are filled with quinoa, dill Havarti and red onion, fried to perfection and topped with crimini mushrooms. Our server told us he wasn't a fan of quinoa until he tried this dish, and I'm sure it could make anyone a quiona super-fan.  The sampler also comes with mac and cheese bites, another new menu item that I got for my meal as a full portion ($9). The cheddar mac and cheese is fried and served with chipotle aioli dipping sauce. After digging into the sampler, it was hard to finish the full appetizer as my meal, and every bit was delicious.  My pal got the Malbec burger ($13), made with melted provolone, carmelized onion, wild mushroom, malbec caramel sauce, lettuce and tomato on a brioche bun with red wine aioli. The burgers here are serious, and she said her meal was delicious.  Besides the tasty food, I loved that on the night we went, a paint-and-wine night was taking place, similar to ones I've participated in at studios and galleries. Salut's manager David said they'll be hosting more, and with all the top-notch menu items and vast array of wines and cocktails, I think hosting them at Salut is a stellar idea.",

There were other dogs chilling on the outdoor patio but plenty of space for everyone. Didn't seem like anyone was sitting inside with the weather being perfect.  Our waitress was nice. It was near closing time, so everyone seemed a little tired, but we rallied for a bit. Being a wine bar, most of my friends opted for a wine flight while I stuck to my usual whiskey cocktail. Wasn't particularly hungry after two days of tiring events, so I ordered the strawberry fields salad.  Both food and drinks were delicious. There was even air conditioning on the patio, so of course my husky made himself at home. We sat at the high communal table in between the indoor and outdoor areas, but there were comfy-looking booths where couples were enjoying their dates or just chilling with their dogs.  I'd consider coming back here for happy hour, mostly for the wine. Food wasn't the highlight. Instead it was the ambiance that encouraged our catching up. Also if anyone is in the event space, this would be adorable for a private event, whether a birthday party or networking event. I think Salut was even advertising that!",

Believe me, wait until classes are NOT in session or there are no shows at Gammage before venturing into Tempe for a meal!  We each started off with a cocktail. Yes, it's day drinking and it's fabulous. I had a so-so grapefruit basil martini and he had a grapefruit mimosa. The cocktails were a bit pricey considering they came in child-sized (at least to us) glasses.  My grilled chicken pita was good but not great. But I'm telling you, the fries more than made up for any shortcomings. The fries were cut wide and thin, and seemed like a cross between French fries and potato chips. They were excellent. But I'm not a ketchup person. Would have loved to have other dipping options.  He had the Sun Devil Burger and pronounced it delicious. He also \"upgraded\" from fries to a side salad. Sucker. A mistake as the salad came with pale green/white lettuce. C'mon restaurants! Salad greens are GREEN! I reluctantly threw a few fries in his direction to make up for it.  With lunch we each had another drink. I had a Lavender Lemon Fizz and he ordered a Sonoran Sunset. They were both good and better options than the first round.  All in all, it was a nice and relaxing lunch. Our server was top-notch and the food was tasty. And those fries! Only complaints? Be a little more generous with those drink servings (or charge less) and, yes, I know this is a bar but please be diligent and clean those sticky tables! Will we return? Probably. Even if only for the fries.",

Salut has an outdoor and an indoor seating, both have an intimate ambience and perfect for a date night or a girls' night.  Service: Service was great. Our waiter was super sweet and was patient with us when we couldn't decide two-three times what we wanted to eat for dinner (our bad).   Drinks:  House Wines- The house Cabernet was delicious and I was satisfied with one glass, and had another as well.  Moscato- The moscato came in a small bottle ice chilled in a bucket. My friend ordered this.   Food:   Mediterranean Chicken Kebab- There were several healthy options on the menu, and I opted for the chicken kabab. It came with pita bread, hummus, and veggies along with the chicken. The dish was a generous serving of everything and I even had leftovers. I came in to the restaurant wanting dessert, but I was so full from dinner, I couldn't eat any more! I will definitely need to come back for more drinks and dessert. They have s'mores on their dessert menu!  Happy Hour and Specials: What attracted me to this place, even though I didn't get here in time for the happy hour, was in fact, the happy hour specials.",

We were greeted right away and decided to sit at the bar. Bet and wine selection is ample. We sampled a couple beers. I settled on the the Peroni--Delish! Service was great, super friendly and welcoming staff.   Only disappointment was the food. I had high hopes and was mildly let down with my selections. We ordered the sampler and pecan crusted salmon along with the sun devil burger. Both average. Truffle fries are not my thing either, they're too hard, and I don't really have anything to compare it to, so I'm not sure if Truffle fries are supposed to be like that.   Bathroom was clean, single stall. Lots of dog Polaroids on the wall. Looks like a great spot to have drinks and conversation with friends or a quiet date night. I'm afraid it may be awhile before I come back though, as the food was just not my style. 3.5 stars because the service and ambiance was lovely.",

We ordered an appetizer as well as two burgers, and I used the Yelp check-in offer for a discount on a glass of wine. There was a little confusion about the check-in offer, but they sorted it out no problem.   The food was really pretty good. Both burgers were massive and had great flavor. Our appetizer (a special for wings) came out after the burgers though, and I wasn't as hungry for them as I had been originally, so it didn't seem worth it at that point. I was also a little disappointed with the upgrade on the chips - it was just a sauce on the side, so I didn't think it was worth the extra money.   Overall, this place was good, but I wasn't raving about it.",

As soon as you get there you can see the ambience is pretty cool, kind of a very mellow romantic vibe although it's a very casual restaurant.  Our waitress Lexi was on point and very friendly. We went with what she recommended and it did not disappoint.  I had a wine flight which I personally loved, because in most restaurants you'll find beer flights. Again Lexi recommended three wines and all three of them were fantastic. We went with the hummus nachos which were OH my God amazing. My husband and I both got the butter not squash raviolis another total hit, but my husband got his with a piece of salmon on the side and it was cooked to perfection. We honestly didn't have room for dessert but want to come back just to have the personal fire pit s'mores desert. Highly recommend this place don't miss out!!!",

Something I love and appreciate is that they're unique as far as interesting cocktails like absinthe and spins on typical breakfast dishes without going too weird. I got a breakfast pita with garlic aioli which was delicious and my friend got a breakfast burger that looked great. Plus they have $20 bubbles with your choice of 3 different juices to accommodate it. Good service - they took my dairy allergy serious and I really enjoyed the experience.",

Great happy hour specials! Half off bottles of wine, $2 off appetizers and cocktails! For an appetizer, we ordered the Pork Wings - marinated with a Sriracha Honey Glaze with bacon bits on top.  There were only four wings with the order, but there was SO much meat on the wings - they were huge! And very tasty! A little spicy for my taste, but still very good, and the meat was super tender! One of the cocktails on the menu was a Spicy Berry Margarita. I ordered that, but  with regular tequila substituted for jalapeno tequila.  My boyfriend ordered a Blueberry Beer-mosa! Both were delicious! For entrees, we ordered the Bacon Grilled Cheese and the Apple-wood Grilled Chicken with French fries and Salut-fries, which have parmesan and a citrus vinaigrette.  EVERYTHING was so flavorful! The portions were very large, we both only ate about half of our orders.  Excellent service, great atmosphere, DELICIOUS food, and great specials at happy hour! We will definitely be back often!",

Cozy space inside with full bar.  They have brunch specials which is always something we enjoy!!  There are lots of different mimosa flavors, they had original (oj) and the blood orange (which was just okay...very sweet.  The regular mimosas were good!  And for $3 each, who can beat that?!  The brunch menu is good, with some healthy and indulgent options.  I had the farmhouse omelette, one friend had the simple breakfast, and the other the breakfast pita.  I also had a side of fruit, which was very fresh and had pineapple, strawberries, and honeydew melon.  My omelette was just okay; the spinach in the omelette is served raw; I think I was expecting sauteed or something...but it was fresh.  The simple breakfast looked really good and the breakfast pita was nice; particularly liked the potatoes dusted w ranch.  The service was good, our server was training a new server, and I liked how patient she was w her.  It was a little slower than we would have thought considering it wasn't that busy, but definitely not to the point of being annoying.  All in all, a good little brunch spot (with good parking!) and I would say we will definitely be back!",

The Salut Sampler included a tease of caprese salad, hummus nachos, quinoa fritters, mac & cheese bites and salut fries. The hummus nachos served on a pita with balsamic and a bite of red onion were a close winner, but the battered mac and cheese bites took the crown.  The masterpiece was actually the Bacon Grilled Cheese sandwich with applewood smoked bacon- whatever I write will be understated. The server- Glenn- added to the ambience.  He was relaxed, polite and appropriately attentive.  I like the implementation of technology:  I was impressed that my order was placed at the table on the server's tablet, leaving no doubt the expediency of the kitchen's service. My card was run in front of me at the time I presented it- saving my time and no doubt Glenn's. David, the manager, popped by to meet and greet, solidifying a comfortable and authentic experience. I look forward to many returns - I hope you also enjoy your dining experience too.",

    "text": "This is such an incredible place - awesome ambiance as well as food; however, this company is relying too largely on sales. The last time I visited I sat with my boyfriend at the bar. Although our bartender was friendly and knowledgable, he was too much. I was there on a date to enjoy the company I went with. Instead, I was interrupted constantly to be told about all the great things Salut was doing and has done. I understand restaurants have to make themselves relevant, but this was truly over the top. I hate giving a bad rating, but I really hope they change their ways. This place could be so much more. My thoughts are just that I don't want to spend my night talking more to the bartender than my date. Unfortunately it's unlikely I'll go back based on this experience, because we both like this spot a lot. This really left a bad impression. Please read your guests more accurately and let the establishment speak for itself.",

The food has been hit or miss each time.  The only consistent dish has been the hummus nachos, which are fantastic.  I also really enjoyed their s'mores and wine special.  It's something fun, and different; great thing to do on a date night.  However, the main courses have always left something to be desired.  My best advice would be to make this your first stop during a night out with friends.  Order one of their unique cocktails, hummus nachos to share, then on to the next stop.",

Well what i got was a normal buttermilk pancake with crumbled oreos and hersheys syrup on it... Not cool.   Eggs benedict? More like eggs beneDONT! The yolk was hard and not runny at all, Hollandaise sauce was overly lemony, and the ham was probably oscar meyer.   Fresh squeezed orange juice was luke warm.  Even after comping the oreo pancakes due to False advertisement, the bill was still 84 dollars for 4 people's brunch. Not worth it.  We were expecting great food based on their advertisements and pictures and this was just not the case. Ill be having brunch at crepe bar on weekends from now on.",

Sunday's special is half-priced bottles, so the 6 of us shared a couple of bottles of one of my favorite Lodi, CA, Zinfandels, Klinker Brick, which is not all that common in wine bars.   Our server, Chris, an adorable cutie from Cypress, was attentive and helpful, even arranging for an extra portion of their signature appetizer, the hummus nachos. The nachos come in 5 portions, and there were six of us, so Chris went back to the kitchen and got us the extra at no charge. The appetizer was delicious too, with tasty hummus on toasty pita bread with pomegranate seeds, and some yummy balsamic reduction drizzle.  The prices were very reasonable, and for 6 of us sharing 3 bottles of wine, a very nice cheese platter and two of the Hummus Nachos, with a 20% tip cost us a mere $23 each.   The place is not far from ASU, and is obviously aimed at a younger crowd, but the manager was accommodating enough to turn down the music upon request. My only complaint would be the un-cushioned metal chairs, which were not all that comfortable for older lady bottoms and backs.   I will definitely go back.",

I have been there four times now and been seated inside and on the patio.  The service all four times was great!  Friendly, attentive staff.  I like the house-made cocktails, especially the cucumber mule (but you gotta like ginger beer for this one).    The drawback is the inconsistency with the food. Although I love the creativity of the dishes, I can't count on it being cooked the same way every time.  Case in point:  Hummus Nachos.  Amazing the first time; warm, slightly crisp pita with the hummus, balsamic drizzle, pomegrante, feta and red onion.  What a tasty surprise!    The second time the pita was overcooked, crunchy and quite greasy.  The third time it was undercooked, soft and not holding the weight of the topping well.  I think Salut is great in concept, the patio is nice and the staff is pleasant.  They just need to get their footing with the food.  The good outweighs the not-so-good though, and I'll continue to visit.",

I think it's great when businesses actually have someone manning their social media regularly. I'm looking forward to a Monday where we can get s'mores and a bottle of wine for $20 after 8pm!

Coming from Phoenix where there's no lack of awesome places to go, I was very eager to try this new place close by to where we live now.  We finally had a chance to try it and I was not disappointed.  The happy hour menu lasts till 7 so it actually gives you a chance to get home, get refreshed and head out.  The draft wine was really good;  I had the Pinot Grigio and the boyfriend had the Malbec.  Both very smooth.  The server, Steve, was very informative and told us about how they're trying some more \"sustainable\" options which was unique.  And the wine list is extensive so I'm looking forward to trying more.  I'm also wanting to have the Cartel Brown Ale.  We had a couple appetizers: the caprese kabobs, two of the bruschetta, the ravioli, the fries and the grilled halloumi cheese.  All were very good and had a unique twist.  (I also used the Yelp check in discount and they were very nice)  The ambiance is nice, and I feel everyone would feel comfortable going.    This is only a few weeks old and am looking forward to it growing and them editing, little things like adding more bruschetta flavors, or more lighting outside and misters.  All and all, I know my go to place now for a good glass of wine and awesome service.  And it's a dog friendly patio",

Not too sweet either, great balance.   - Cinnamon Toast Crusted Chicken & Waffles were the star of the meal. Juicy chicken with crispy crunch in eat bite and the waffle was the perfect texture and sweetness.   - Bacon Beer Chorizo was our least favorite which was surprising. Sauce felt a little thick and wasn't very hot. Still a good dish, might have just been off that morning.   - French Press Coffee was pretty solid too.   Overall, great experience and will be back. Oh and that morning there was some live music which made the whole experience even better.",

My only qualm was that it took me FOREVER to get there due to construction, but obviously that's temporary and I'll be back when it's over (plus - it was worth sitting in traffic!).   I didn't have an actual meal but I my friend and I had a few items off the happy hour menu. We had Hummus Nachos, Peppy Dew Peppers and the Caprese Kabobs. All of the food was delicious and came out quickly. There's a lot more on the menu I want to try next time!   They have great happy hour drink specials, both of us had wine, it was a nice Malbec. We also sampled the Cab on tap that was yummy. We were hesitant to try wines out of a tap/draft (it makes me think of boxed wine - ew)... but I/we were very pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was and continued on for a second glass.   The restaurant is super cute and word is that you can bring your dogs and sit on the patio so I'll have to bring the fur baby next time. :)   Quite possibly one of my favorite parts of all of it was the service. I think customer service is a lost art but these guys got it spot on. Our server was attentive but not overbearing and offered up suggestions when we needed it. We sat at the end of the bar so we chatted a bit as well and he was very informative about the restaurant itself as well as the wine selection.   Can't wait to go back!

The only plus was the bloody marys, they were pretty good. Overall, I would not recommend eating here for brunch.",

Hanna did a great job as our server, Jesse, the executive chef came to our table to explain the dishes and gave us recommendations, and the manager David truly cares. It is nice to know how much you are appreciated as a customer. And the food...delicious! We started the the hummus nachos (highly recommend) and quinoa fritters. The hubby had the Malbec burger, which he raved about, and I had the Siracha burger. Honestly two of the best burgers I have ever tasted. The ambiance is cool, the mules are tasty, and they had a fun classic rock station on to top off the vibe. Overall, great night and we will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Oh so yummy.   My boyfriend and I came in with our two dogs after hiking around Papago Park. We had the patio to ourselves when we first arrived, and this gave my dogs time to get used to the atmosphere. We happened to get there during happy hour and got caprese salad and humus nachos off of the happy hour menu. The humus was really flavorful but I expected something different with the name \"nachos.\" It was essentially humus scoops on pita wedges drizzled with balsamic vinegar with a few pomegranate seeds and diced red onion for decoration. It was delicious, but not so much \"nachos.\" I expected more toppings. The mozzarella in the caprese salad was also tasty, it seemed very fresh possibly even locally made. For the main event I ordered the brie hive and my boo got the sriracha burger. My Brie hive was exactly what I was looking for. The combination of toasted sourdough bread, warm brie, crisp apples, prosciutto, and arugula(?) was spectacular. I would definitely come back for that sandwich. My love really enjoyed his burger and it smelled great and looked so very juicy from where I sat. For our sides I got the regular fries and he got the greek salad. Both sides were good enough but the sandwiches were really the stars of the show.  I also want to say that they were very welcoming to our two dogs. The chef brought them pepperoni dog treats to munch on and our waiter brought them a bowl of water. I thought that was very thoughtful of them and showed that they truly love animals. I really appreciated that added kindness.  When the restaurant started to get busy around 6pm we decided to leave. Our dogs were getting skittish with all of the people. I would definitely come back and next time try out some of their craft cocktails and their smores.  Just one small negative, they are right on University and that can give off some traffic sounds. There is also a low hum coming from the big power grid across the street, but you can only hear these clearly if no music is playing and you are sitting outside on the patio.",

The service was a little slow, had to wait a while to get our drink order in although they did bring water out right away.  We started out with the hummus nachos and they were very tasty.  My husband who doesn't like hummus had two.    He had the Malbec Burger and upgraded the patty to bison.  He said it was delicious.  He also got the Salut Fries which were very tasty.  I had the Sun Devil Turkey Burger w/out the bun.  The turkey had a little bit of a kick to it which i liked a lot.  The only minus was that I asked for no onion and there was on hidden underneath the lettuce and wrapped up.  I almost took a bite of it.  Close call but my keen senses helped me to avoid disaster.  Also, a note about auto-gratuity...if you have a party of 6 or more they add 18% gratuity but for some reason it is noted on the receipt by the server and not added into the total.  So I calculated the split check amounts including the gratuity and noted on the receipt which card to charge which amount.  The server let me know that we couldn't do it that way - we had to charge the amount without the tip and then add the tip.  Which he let me know 3 times, was merely a suggestion and that we could tip more if we'd like.  I get it dude, this is not my first rodeo.  Repeatedly asking for a bigger tip has never inspired me to dig into my wallet.  Not once.    Other than the snafu with the check at the end a very pleasant evening and great atmosphere.",

Th waffle was really good, however the chicken had no flavor so I sent it back and got the Malbec burger. And it was delicious. It's probably now my go to burger.  The mimosas were good, I've had better and I've had worse. I think it was the orange juice that made them not great, because they definitely did the job.  Our first server Riley was very pleasant, knowledgeable, and friendly. We were there so long that it was time for him to leave so we cashed out with him and welcomed Tyler. Tyler was AMAZING! We laughed so much and so hard. He was able to build a lasting report with us so that will most likely be calling to make sure he's working before we go. When you go, ask for his section he made an enjoyable meal memorable. The manager was also very accommodating with changing to the games that we wanted since of course we didn't all like the same teams. I honestly cannot say enough nice things about Tyler and how lucky Salut it to have him. Probably because as a said, the mimosas get the job done.",

    "text": "Can't say I'd come back other than for maybe a happy hour.  First I ordered a cheese board for the table. At $13 I expected a better selection of cheeses but we got a few chunks of 3 different cheeses, a handful of grapes, 3 big scoops of hummus and a few slices of green apple. *shrug* like that was it.  The waiter just dropped it off and bailed. I'm used to being asked if I'd like an explanation of the cheeses on the board or told w/o asking... nope. just dropped on the table. Later I asked him what type of cheese the marbled purplish one was... I got a confused look and a mumbled answer; to which he then disappeared again. My history with cheeses says it's a wine-soaked cheese of some sort but I guess I wasn't finding out.   Entre... I had the Chicken Chasseur. Presentation was grand. Taste left a lot to be desired. It seems the chicken had some seasoning on it... pepper it seemed but I couldn't taste it and it was boring and bland. I had two others try it to confirm my opinion and they agreed. There was just no life to the dish. Looked good at first but it's just a plain frozen chicken breast on a plate with warm mushroom sauce and a slight smattering of mushrooms around the plate laid on top of farro.   Stella pitcher was $20. That's fine but reminds me it's more of an ASU budlight kind of bar.   The girl said her burger was good. and I did very much enjoy her fries. The girls said their drinks were good but I wasn't in the mood to try mixed drinks. They had a groupon and there seemed to be an over-abundance of limitations on said groupons but the girls got out fine, were happy with their meals and even got a couple desserts thrown in too.  I'm not hating on the place but I don't find anything unique about it food-wise. I'd have givin it only 2 stars if the girls didn't enjoy their food like they did.",

Best part is, no matter what you chose it's guaranteed to make your heart smile. If you order the cheesecake you'll never be able to eat anyone else's again.

We sat outside with enough light and shade and it was a cute place. There were only 3 groups at the restaurant so it wasn't too loud.  It had lights and nice decor. It was happy hour (3-6:30) so The entree and Tapas was 2$ off. They also have happy hour on the selected drinks as well. I ordered the Mac & Cheese Bites ($9-$2= $7). I was surprised when the food came because the portion was small in a big saucer plate. There were 4 mac and cheese bites with spinach on the bottom with chipotle sauce to dip in. It was delicious. The outside was crispy while the inside was soft and well cooked mac and cheese. It wasn't too salty or bland. The sauce made a nice kick to the taste. The spinach was just spinach. Nothing special there. My friend ordered the Salut Fries($6-$2=$4) and it comes in a cylindrical can and this was very special. It had the perfect blend of Parmesan cheese, herbs, and citrus vinaigrette. I would come again just for these fries. Our food did come earlier than the utensils but the server was nice. The shoestring fries were crispy and perfectly drenched in the vinaigrette and the toppings. Overall the food, presentation, feel of the place, and service was good. For a first time at this place, I was pleased with my experience here.",

Word to the wise- DON'T order coffee here. We were initially impressed that our coffee came in a French press, however, being that we also have a French press at home, we could quickly tell by the taste that the press filter hadn't been cleaned in some time.  Finally, the service is in need of some coaching. I say coaching because while every server was extremely kind, they made too many mistakes. Dirty cups? No offer for cream or sugar with coffee? Wrong items on our bill? Again, nice people- they just need some help.",

Super laid back, so doing go expecting the meal of a life time but a place to eat, drink, chill and chat with your homies.",

The mac and cheese bites appetizer only had four, but they were large and super good, especially with the spicy chipotle dipping sauce they came with. Everyone seemed to love their bacon and chorizo egg Benedict plates (similar to the outrageous hangover fries!) and I loved my Salmon Avocado plate with arugula and potatoes.

Creativity with this dish earns them much respect in my book. The hummus had, I believe, caramelized onion, balsamic, and chunks of nuts. What an original idea.  Then came the  Apple Brochette on sliced french bread along with feta.  This dish was made to be enjoyed while sipping a glass of wine.  Two more appetizers were quickly consumed including Mediterranean tacos, and feta french fries.    Desert was the \"piece de resistance.\"  S'mores!  Yep, s'mores.  They bring out this mini s'more roaster which I assumed contained Sterno, and graham crackers, chocolate, and marshmallows along with a fondue stick.  You then proceed to make s'mores on your table. How fun is that!  Service was fun, efficient, and non intrusive.",

If he reads this, we're the ones that told you about the Death Star ice cube mold that you can buy on Amazon :-)  Food was good, shared the hangover fries and the deep fried mac n cheese balls.  Was actually enough food for us.  Okay, so mimosa time - it was $18 bottomless mimosas with penny refills.  They pour OJ from the gun into a pitcher and top off with Andre/Wycliff champagne.  I would prefer to add my own OJ to my mimosa as I'm very champagne heavy on my drinks.  Downside really was that, and the drinks just weren't cold enough, thus us only sticking around for a couple of hours.  Staff - please make the mimosas COLDER and let us have a carafe of OJ to add our own?  If so, we'll definitely be regulars!",

The first time I came here was with my husband for brunch, I ordered the breakfast nachos which were quite tasty, but my husband's cinnamon toast crunch chicken & waffles fell flat. The chicken was pretty bland, and there was nothing really memorable about the waffle. Save the calories for Lolo's because it wasn't worth wasting on this dish.   The second time I came here was with some friends for dinner, we shared the hummus nachos, which like the breakfast nachos were delicious. For my main course I ordered the Summer salad which sounded way better on paper than it was. It was a spinach salad that included mostly spinach with a few measly toppings. Most of the bites I had were just spinach since the toppings were so chintzy. I also tasted my friend's brie and prosciutto panini, which was oddly bland considering those ingredients are typically full of flavor.  Can't say I will choose this place again, as there are plenty of other more tasty options in the area.",

My order was burnt, and the hummus was crusty..I took a few bites and told our server that I did not like it, all he said was okay he did not ask me if I wanted something else or why.   Thankfully we had the salut fries as an appetizer which is the only thing that came out right.   It was time for the check and another server came up to us along with our server and again nothing was done.  They both walk up to the bar and I'm assuming the guy behind the bar was the manager they kept on looking at me, clearly talking about me. Our server brings over our check and tells me that he gave me 10% off.. What a joke!  I am really disappointed and I surely will not go there again it's over priced for the quality of food they are serving.",

    "text": "Very disappointing!   I was told there was a 10-15 minute wait to order food due to the kitchen being backed up. I decided to wait because it was like waiting to be seated when a restaurant is crowded. While I was waiting I was given a glass of water but the bartender did not ask if I wanted another beverage. So after what seemed like 10 minutes and eye contact he asked how I was doing. I said I would like a drink. He apologized for the wait for my drink. So after awhile he said another 5 minutes then I could order food. Long after 5 minutes I asked if I could order. He said he wasn't sure because the kitchen wasn't telling him anything. So he goes to investigate and reported another 20 minutes! Now I'm highly upset. He gave me a coupon for free hummus nachos that do not sound appealing. And I told him they do not. So I told him that the situation is ridiculous and I'm not paying for my lemonade. And I left.   I understand things happen that are beyond our control. I understand dealing with the public isn't easy. And the bartender was the messenger. That is why I waited for so long.  However the service was highly disappointing. Waiting nearly a hour to order food! I wonder what would've happened if I ordered food? Another hour? I hope Salut's management reads this review and informs staff this was unacceptable. I do not want heads rolling. This can be teachable moment of proper communication between the kitchen and wait staff. I'm giving one star because the host was friendly.",

I look forward to visiting again to try drinks from the extensive menu they have to offer. In addition I would love to try other food items on the menu. I had an unsweetened black iced tea with hibiscus flavoring(and something else I can't remember). We both shared the option for four selections of bruschetta. I felt each flavor was unique(one was wild mushroom with goat cheese, one was fig and arugula with prosciutto, one was caprese and the last was hummus and chicken). I would get each of those flavors again- the bread was perfectly crispy but very easy to eat. We also split the chicken sandwich with side of Salut fries and it was delicious. I loved the toppings and flavors on the sandwich. They have a great location and restaurant size, it's perfectly decorated with some creative and unique pieces throughout the site. Overall a great experience!",

There was a hair in one of our dishes. They comped the dish and gave more Salut Fries to compensate. The fries were actually pretty tasty with an interesting citrus sauce. Eat 'em before they're soggy! Their bruschetta is not Postino's and I'll leave it at that. Cocktail drinks weren't very strong. Overall, friendly service but food was nothing to write home about. Probably not worth a return visit for me.",

We arrived at the restaurant at 6:15 and immediately placed our orders.  We were a group of 6 so we were enjoying our conversations and not paying attention to the time.  Well, when we did look at the time, it was 7:10 and we had not yet received our food!  Imagine, sitting 50 minutes and having great conversation and not noticing that your food had not yet arrived.  The atmosphere is conducive to socializing.  Needless to say, we had to demand our food ASAP or walk out without dinner.  Our food arrived within seconds of notifying the staff of our urgent need (was it sitting under a warming lamp all that time?   Hmmmm).  We all had to stuff the food into our mouths and rush out so we could make our 7:30 reservations.  I hope the food was worth the time, but I really couldn't say since I didn't have time to taste it.  We may give Salut another try when we don't have a time constraint but no promises.",

They charge $4 for a draft beer during happy Hour (unless you get Rolling Rock) and the domestic bottles are only $3 normally, so basically happy Hour pricing is useless. Another place that also picks and chooses what they want us to eat during happy Hour. They only decided to put four items on the HH menu. Most other dishes seem overpriced for a College area like Tempe. The patio is decent enough and one waitress should clearly be modeling something rather than slinging food to tables of college kids using daddy's money to buy expensive entrees.",

The prosciutto was wrapped around cantaloupe that was not ripe and hard as a rock.  The fries were cold.  I will say the hummus nachos were very good, but since that was only 25% of the dish, it did not redeem that food.  I mentioned all this to the server as I think feedback is important, but she just gave me a blank stare.  I will not return.",

The Moscow Mule was good.  My problem was that I am gluten free and specifically chose this place for their advertised gluten free options. I ordered the Bruschetta as did a few people with me (theirs was regular).  I should start by saying it tasted good. My problem was the size. Unless you saw the stark contrast between what they got and what I got, I guess you would not realize how much of a difference it was. My portions were less that an 8th of what they got ( my bread was cocktail size bread and since the space is less, the contents on top were an 8th less too) and yet I was charged $3 more for it being gluten free. I felt cheated and gouged. I did not complain while I was there because I was with a group and did not want to cause trouble, but in my humble  opinion, they should measure the toppings from the regular size plate and use extra pieces of the tiny bread if they want to make up for the value of charging $3 more for the gluten free. As it stands, I ended up getting a lot less food for $3 more.   If you go there for gluten free, either don't get that (stick with a salad) or know that you are going to feel a little cheated when it is all said and done.",

Being a bartender and knowing how overwhelming stuff can get when you have a full bar and servers are needing their drinks they did a great job. Fun to watch and awesome product knowledge. The 2 ppl I went with got bottomless mimosas for $18 (and you didn't have to buy and entree like most places) and they were on top of refilling them... Even when they were extremely busy. Definitely will come back for the service alone! Thanks guys",

My only two complaints after a total of 3 visits are that the booths are very small and if you sit outside there is a slight fly problem. But otherwise the food and service has always been on point.   As far as drinks go, I've had The Salut, Oh Honey!, and Bird Call, all of which I enjoyed.   Bruschetta I've had the pesto, chicken & hummus, sriracha blt, and roasted garlic. My favorites so far are the chicken & hummus and the pesto.   Food wise I've had the Malbec and Sriracha burger. The Malbec burger is SO.GOOD. Like stop what you're doing, drive to Salut and get it good. Last night I had the sriracha which was good, don't get me wrong, but the combination of flavors in the Malbec is so bomb. I also prefer the regular fries to the salut fries because I like to dip in ketchup but to each their own.",

We both loved the nachos, they were served on a very tasty pita with a lot of flavor. We also split a burger and fries that was cooked perfectly. For dessert we had the s'mores, which I thought was very interesting, everyone has had s'mores, but rarely do you have the chance to order them when eating out. Overall, I liked the decor of the restaurant and thought the service was on point. Even though it's right near ASU, it wasn't your typical college hang out, which was nice when you're going on a date. I'd definitely go back to try some of the other dishes I saw at different tables.",

I'd never visited before, despite living at Gateway Apartments nearby in the past, so I found it somewhat funny and ironic that I visited only when I lived elsewhere. But I digress. I arrived with my friends and we were promptly seated. I was pleased to note that the patio was dog-friendly and noticed some furry little cuties sitting quietly under tables. Our server, Brian (or Bryan? I think it was Brian) was very attentive to us and really knew how to provide good service. He was patient with us and knew how to answer all our queries.  I ordered a Cowboy Omelette, I found the egg a little bit thick for my taste, but otherwise, the dish was wonderful. The Mexican chorizo omelette with mushrooms, tomatoes, cheese, bits of bacon was filling and full of flavor! And don't even get me started on the ranch-dusted potatoes--mmmm!!! My friends' dishes were also pleasing to them as well. We ordered a pitcher of PBR as their promotion, and one of my friends had a cocktail and it was delicious perfection! Their bottomless mimosas was quite a good deal as well. Brian was alert and kept our water glasses filled whenever they were empty, which I really appreciated as it was quite a hot day that day. I had a wonderful, memorable experience here and hope to visit here often with friends--perhaps next time for Happy Hour? My other friends who did not join me that day have always spoken highly of this place, and after my visit, I'm inclined to see why. Delicious food, yummy drinks and attentive service--what more can one ask for??",

We started with the hummus nachos, which we were told are the specialty, and we got them half on pita, half on cucumber. Yumz!! Next were the quinoa fritters. Oh em gee. Next time we might just get three orders of those!! We were still a little hungry, so we ordered four pieces of bruschetta which David, the fabulous manager, asked the chef to cut into thirds. The bruschetta was also very good but if we're being honest, I'm still dreaming about the quinoa fritters.  As it was happy hour, we could order one bottle of wine (at a very reasonable price) and get a bottle of one of their house wines for $5. Keary told us we could take the 2nd bottle home unopened, or she would cork it for us if we didn't finish it. Fabulous!   Keary was friendly and informative, and even stopped to chat a little with us about an upcoming weekend trip we were taking. We also had the pleasure of meeting the charming Chris, who made sure our glasses were never empty. Many thanks to Keary, Chris and David for the awesome service! We will definitely be back!!!",

That day is now a day that will live in infamy.   As my husband and I perused the menu our buddies were already enjoying the delights of Salut mimosas. These were readily filled and refilled by our waiter Simon. At this point we only knew Simon was a stealthy little ninja who immediately refilled glasses while appearing out of nowhere, we did not know that he is the most bad ass of all bad asses.   Before ordering a thing happened. This thing was such an unexpected thing. A fucking crazy thing. It's a thing so amazing and insane that I can't talk about it here. (And that's a real damn shame.) What I can say is that ninja-Simon swooped in and proved all of his extreme bad assery. Now let me explain something, this group is not easily impressed. We have had some unique adventures that are pretty fucking epic on their own. I was impressed. We were all impressed. Simon is a goddamn boss.   After this thing, this legit amazing thing happened, we ordered. The food was great. Seriously bomb. The mimosas flowed, and the manager stopped by to talk about the thing.   The manager reminded me of Lou Ashby from Californication. I don't know why, he just did, okay? He was also astounded by the thing. We laughed. He was rad. The service was awesome.   So here's the breakdown: Sunday brunch at Salut is awesome. Simon was rad. Manager was rad. The service is prompt, attentive, and friendly. The food was totally delicious. The mimosas were tasty and plentiful.   Eat there. Do it.",

    "text": "Okay, a few months later, and I'm still a Salut regular- but I feel the need to update my review.  My biggest issue with Salut at this point is the lack of consistency - which has basically been a problem since they opened. I used to give them the benefit of the doubt as a \"new restaurant,\" but by now they've been around for almost 2 years, and I expect the same experience every time I go. Don't get me wrong, it's usually still good - but sometimes it's not, and that's an issue.   First - this restaurant has more waitstaff turnover then I've ever seen. Like I said, my boyfriend and I are definitely regulars, and maybe 2 servers recognize us. We have a new server nearly every time we go. Next - STOP CHANGING THE MENU. I get that some things are less popular, but honestly it's so frustrating. I used to be able to get a turkey burger, and now my option is bison - for a few bucks more? Meh. Last but not least, I stand by my opinion that the food is overpriced for the portion size. You're not a 5-star restaurant, so when I pay $13 for a salad I expect it to be pretty big, or $9 for the hummus nachos appetizer, I expect more than 5 smallish pita slices.   Honestly, I want Salut to be great. I want to keep loving it. But it's almost to the point where I'll drive the 10 extra minutes to Postino when I feel like wine & light eats - I know everything there is the same, every time.",

    "text": "I came here with a small bachelorette party, and this restaurant was exactly what we needed.  First of all, due to a humorous run of events, we were about an hour late for our reservation, with just one of our party there to hold down the fort.  The hostess and waitress were super understanding and friendly about what was surely frustrating for them to accommodate.  Other good news about the behind-the-scenes action: some friends of the bride-to-be who couldn't make it in, called ahead of time to buy a bottle of champagne, a first round of drinks, etc and (at least to our knowledge) this went off without a hitch.   We sat on the patio, which I should mention is dog-friendly.  There are heaters if the whether requires it, but it was a lovely night out.  All those who were drinking really enjoyed their champagne and various mule concoctions, and we got a kick out of the water glasses made from recycled wine bottles.  We had the Prosciutto Wrapped Melon and Hummus Nachos as starters, which were both really good.  I went for the Bacon Grilled Cheese Sandwich (hold the bacon) and was very pleased... I'm sure bacon lovers would enjoy it just as much served as described!  One side of the toast was slightly burnt, but the flavors of the cheese and tomato made up for it.  I upgraded to the Salut Fries, which is a must-do.  I would definitely order this sandwich again!  The Brie Hive looked super great too, which I would like to try someday.  This is a good spot for a bite to eat with a small group of friends or for a date.  The atmosphere is a little hipster, and the service was accommodating.  Their happy hour looks great too, but we were (way) too late to enjoy it this time... maybe next time!",

They have fantastic specials on PBR as well, and from what it looked like, stumbling distance from the dorms. We came the morning before a Spring Training game and  it wasn't super slammed either. It was about a 6 minute drive to the Cubs ballpark as well, so, I couldn't find a single bad thing to say about the place. Definitely coming back next year for Spring Training.",

My first glass of Prosecco was just about luke warm, that was disappointing. Then we moved on to the truffle fries... they were very tasty and presented nicely. We tried four different bruschetta and were underwhelmed by them all. The atmosphere on the patio is great and it's a nice place but overall wasn't impressed.",

Several other staff members stopped as asked us if we needed anything. The food was great. I had the biscuits and gravy, my husband had the cowboy omelet. The mimosa were also as well.

    "text": "Reservations were made through Open Table on Friday for brunch on Mother's Day, Sunday. I tried updating my reservation on Saturday, but it said the restaurant wasn't taking reservations for the day. It didn't even say there was no availability for the time. I was a little worried that my reservation would not stand, but the host was able to seat me right away. He even thanked me for making a reservation so I'm still a little confused about their reservation process.   Tip: Make reservations for holidays a few days in advance in case they decide to stop taking them (at least through Open Table). Yelp coupon: As of 5/14/17, the house wines are the Vista Point (and I believe Rock Brook). According to Kaylan, the house wines change so double check with your server.  Kaylan our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable about the popular menu items such as the Skillet. She was so sweet and came by frequently to make sure we didn't need anything else.   Hummus Nachos - You can taste that the hummus is homemade with its consistency and unique taste. Very delicious! My only comment would be that I couldn't taste the very few pomegranate seeds. If you're trying to decide an appetizer, you can't go wrong with this!  Salmon Avocado (gluten-free) - The dish came with PLENTY of salmon pieces. For me, the salmon tasted and felt almost tuna-like because it was dry. I just re-read the description for this meal and noticed it was supposed to be honey-glazed... I wish the avocado was a bit more ripe because I couldn't really taste it. The egg was perfectly prepared though! However, the main ingredients didn't provide the flavor the dish needed.  There is a nice selection of other brunch entrees that I would want to come back and try.",

Couple of us ordered the Bacon Bloody Mary while I stuck with the basic beer.  For food we went for the Chicken and Waffles, Quinoa Pancakes, and the Benedict Florentine.  I didn't have the chance to try the Florentine, but the Chicken and Waffles were delicious.  Extra crispy chicken breast atop a hearty belgium waffle with a side of cinnamon butter and honey maple syrup; so wrong, but so right at the time!  The Quinoa pancakes was made with cinnamon and honey giving it a spicy and sweet bite and topped with thick whip cream and strawberries.  Perfect start to my Sunday eating experience.  Foodies and runners alike should enjoy this spot as a must go!  Service was on top of things and the ambiance was semi-wine and semi-sports bar in my opinion.  They had a large screen projector showing the playoff game so that was nice. - Enjoy!",

    "text": "Visit Salut for the first time for restaurant week. The menu online looked interesting, so we thought we'd give it a try. Big mistake.   We had reservations for 6:00 and were seated immediately. Unfortunately, we were a party of five seated at a four top and it took the waitress 15 minutes to approach us. The restaurant wasn't crowded (maybe half full), mind you, on a Saturday during restaurant week. I guess that should have been an indicator.   Once we placed our order from the prefix menu, it took at least half an hour to get our appetizers. We had a variety of the three available.   Macaroni and cheese bites with bacon and jalapeno were pretty good. Hummus nachos were okay. The pork wings were unremarkable.   Half an hour later the waitress finally collected our empty plates and told us our food \"would be right out.\" We waited another twenty minutes before 2 of the 5 entrees were brought out.   The gnocchi was tasty, though one of the shrimp still had the \"poop shoot\" which made it unappetizing. The salmon was ridiculously over cooked.   Three of us got fillet, which came out about 8 minutes after the other entrees. One was over cooked, one was undercooked, and all three severely lacked seasoning. The vegetable sides (which were the same on the salmon) were such a throwaway it's not worth mentioning.   When they brought the dessert 20 minutes later, we thought there might have been a mistake as the cheesecake nachos looked almost identical to the hummus appetizer. The nachos lacked flavor and tasted almost like cream cheese on a thick, crunchy churro. The sorbet was underwhelming and a tiny portion. The s'mores were ridiculous. It was 4 graham cracker, 4 marshmallows, and 6 little chunks of a Hershey's bar. It came with a fire pit, but I can make that at home for a lot less than $44.   The waitress rarely checked in, didn't clear plates timely, and seemed to have no interest in our experience. We will not go back.",

    "text": "Salut   We had breakfast here on a Sunday. We sat inside. It was a little chilly outside but there was already a crowd enjoying the patio. The food items on the menu are limited but this is a restaurant with multiple drink menus. The decor is trendy and inviting. This is a very cute wine bar. They have these amazing mirrors framed in cut wine bottles. I loved the mirrors.   For breakfast I just had coffee and water but the brunch cocktails were very tempting. The water they serve is infused with cucumbers and very refreshing. I love the cut wine bottle drinking glasses. I ordered the Florentine Benedict to share. I usually find eggs Benedict so heavy that I can only eat half of a two egg portion. At Salut the portions are fancy and small. I could have eaten the whole meal and then some. Good thing we ordered an extra side of fruit and that we were trying not to overeat.    The funny thing is that we did order a breakfast dessert. It is fun to be on vacation. For dessert we had the chef's special dessert it was a French toast with banana ice cream. It was tasty but I could have gone without it.   This is a great spot to go for a drink and a fancy snack. Just don't go to Salut expecting or wanting big food portions.   If I lived in the area I would definitely come back to Salut. It looks like they have some great wine specials. They also have a nice patio and bar. Salut has a lot going for it. I am glad I got the chance to have a meal here.",

When you look at website/menu, you get a real \"Mediterranean restaurant\" vibe, sign sit down tables, fresh entrees, and reasonable prices. However, when you get there, it had much more of a a bar/bbq set/up. Felt dark and tavern-like.  Having said that, the service was outstanding. We were there on a Friday night, the bartender was incredibly attentive to how we were doing and what we needed. Our server (kona, I think?) was excellent and we lacked for nothing, Our good was also extremely fresh and delicious. A few of us had one of the salads w walnuts and strawberries etc, and I split the salmon - dish was awesome, though definitely not a super generous portion.  Good place w potential to be amaaaaazing",

It took several minutes for someone to come over and bring a menu.  It took even longer to get water and for them to take an order.  When I finally ordered from their brunch menu, I was hungry and looking forward to trying something different.  When the food came out it was completely cold as if it had been sitting in the fridge for the last 30 minutes after they cooked it.  I sent it back and they did credit me for the cost of the meal and the manager did apologize.  By then I was not willing to wait another 30 minutes for another meal.  They did deduct the meal from my bill, but did notice a \"surcharge\" and room for a \"tip\".  I do not live in Tempe and did not know what the surcharge was for.  Later I found out it was because they were paying their employees $15.00 an hour but also expected a tip on top of that.  For a $6.00 bill, it cost me double between tax, tip and surcharge. Not worth it at all.",

    "text": "Honestly I am shocked by all the good reviews for this restaurant, my experience here was one of the worst I've ever had. Maybe we just came on an incredibly bad day, but it was so bad I would never ever return.   We came for brunch on a Sunday, it wasn't crowded but we still had to wait for a table on the patio. We waited about 10 minutes just for a table to be cleared. While we were waiting, literally next to the hostess stand, another couple walked in and the hostess seated them immediately at the table we were promised and waiting on. It was incredibly awkward pointing that out to the hostess then having to watch her make the people leave the table. Just the beginning of a horrible experience.   Our server, I never caught his name, provided the worst service I've ever received at a restaurant. It took him over 20 minutes just to bring us waters. By that time we were ready to order. We ordered 3 coffees and 3 of us got omelettes and 1 got a skillet.   There must have been something wrong with the coffee maker or it was just old coffee because when it arrived it was not even hot, it was cold and filled with coffee grounds. We never even got the opportunity to let the server know since he then disappeared for 45 minutes! The people around us also looked extremely angry, if I hadn't already ordered we would have left.   After waiting over an hour the food arrived. My vegetable omelette was the driest, saddest excuse for an omelette I've ever eaten. The vegetables inside were 100% raw, raw spinach, raw onion, that's not an omelette. The eggs were chalky and there's no way that omelette was made with real eggs. They tasted like powdered eggs. It was disgusting. I ate literally 1 bite. But once again I couldn't send it back because our server was NO WHERE in sight. Never checked on us to see if the food was okay, no coffee refills, just dropped the check off another 45 minutes later. It ended up being almost a 3 hour brunch and not by choice, that's how slow this service was.   Also the flys on the patio were unbearable which was just the cherry on top of this horrendous experience. I don't know how the food is for dinner, but skip the brunch it's disgusting and slow.",

    "text": "We had gone to Salut Kitchen Bar in a group and the evening started off fairly well. It was pretty much empty in the restaurant and we were seated immediately at the table that was reserved for us. After most of our party had arrived, our waitress came by to get our order for drinks and appetizers. We weren't initially going to order anything for starters but we ended up getting the Fried Mac & Cheese balls. They were pretty tasty but not worth the price. I think I probably would not get them again, but they were really crispy as I think they should have been and it was a good portion size; the sauce they came with wasn't anything special. We figured they were sufficient to hold us over since our waitress wasn't to be seen again for a while. We were also left without refills on drinks for quite some time.  Finally, when we flagged waitress over again, we put our entree orders in. I got the Brie Hive Sandwich with the Salut fries and my date got the Stuffed Bell Peppers, others in our party got a variety of different things. It took a really long time to get everything so we dug in as soon as the food hit our table! The sandwich was just okay, it was a grilled somewhat panini style but it wasn't browned on the outside so it was greasy. Salut fries weren't worth the extra cost either. They tasted a bit sour with the vinaigrette and they were also very soggy. I think my food might have sat for a little bit before it got brought out because it was on the lukewarm-cold side. The bell peppers on the other hand were pretty tasty. I'd say these are worth the order although again, when we got them, they weren't piping hot like we would have liked them.  Quite a few people at our table were hesitating but decided to put in an order for dessert. We were all trying to wait for everyone to finish up before leaving but after waiting for over half an hour, some of us had to take off to make it to our next destination. The desserts still hadn't arrived! I'm not sure how the restaurant justified bringing out everything so slowly, but we were just happy to get our checks and head out. Our server was nice and tried to keep up with the big group throughout the night. Because the food wasn't that great and there were such long wait times, I'm not sure I'd recommend this restaurant to others.",

A friend and I were visiting Phoenix and went to the Grand Canyon for the day. On our way back, we made a reservation via open table for 8pm on a Sunday. Apparently the restaurant closes early on Sundays. When we walked in there were still several tables occupied, but when we asked to be seated and explained we had a reservation the only answer the staff had was \"well I don't know why Open Table let you do that, we aren't open\". We explained we were tourists and had used Uber to get there and did not know the area. Even after hearing this, the initial person we spoke with could not be bothered to point us in a direction where there was an open restaurant and continued to state he didn't know why we were able to make a reservation. I fully understand that we showed up after closing, even if it was unintentional, but I still cannot believe that the staff couldn't even be bothered to tell us where we could potentially eat that evening if they couldn't serve us.",

The food is also delicious! This is a very underrated restaurant. They have HUMMUS NACHOS. Like, come on. And the bruschetta is on point. This is truly a perfect date night spot because you can sit and sip wine and snack while enjoying the patio or inside ambiance.   I think this will be in our date night restaurant rotation for a long time, but I have also filed Salut away in my head as a good place to order food from for a party. When I reach the stage of adulthood where I actually need to hire a caterer, this place is on my radar!",

To get two drinks was over 10 minutes and the restaurant was at about 10% capacity.   The food was excellent and was average on delivery time. Here is the part that turned me away along with the slow drink service, I ordered a burger, and I would say it was the best I have had in years but the fact I asked for it to be a lettuce wrap (which came out with one piece for the top and one for the bottom), I was charged extra for that. So if management decides to up charge for 2 pieces of lettuce, where is the discount for taking the bun off? My wife asked for pita bread instead of the normal bun and guess what, that was an up charge.  I probably would have not been annoyed if I was explained up front but when you get your check with surprises on it, that is disturbing.   Also, the burgers come with fries, if you want the tiny dinner salad, guess what, it is an up charge. For a restaurant that advertise it is Healthy, I guess all the carbs are free and the healthy lettuce is extra.  Disappointing service and charges that are not explained upfront will confirm I will not be returning and letting friends know not to visit this establishment.   I don't mind driving (which I drove 38 miles to get there) or paying, but slow service and hidden charges makes it a below average experience.",

    "text": "Went here because it seems that everyone said it was a great place for Happy Hour.  So we showed up at 5pm. ( Thursday) no one on the patio. Maybe 15 people total inside.  Water was served. Looking at the Happy Hour menu..... really nothing great. $11 dollars a drink... with $2 off? Really? Okay the 1/2 off bottle of wine is a good deal.... but if you don't drink wine... it's not.  Had the Bruschetta.. choose 4 for $16. They were good. ( not great).  Service was spotty. So 4 drinks and one appetizer later... and a $54 bill... we went to Bar Louie! Happy Hour awesome! $5.50 martinis! Huge glasses.. not the small teeny martini glasses at Salut. ( for $9) Oh and I got the same thing from server..... the kitchen is backed up.. do you want to put an order in. Really? Place was empty!",

    "text": "Salut is great.  Really great.  I've had it bookmarked forever, and finally when a friend was visiting from St. Louis I suggested stopping here for dinner on Thursday night before we drove on up to the art walk in Scottsdale.    We had the hummus nachos to start, a delicious Old Fashioned for me, and a couple of glasses of house pinot grig for her.  She had something healthy like the quinoa bowl or something for her entree...I don't know...I wasn't really paying attention because I had the malbec burger and that was perfect.  The burger was full of flavor and I think they must grind them up fresh because it was so moist and tender.  The bun holds up well, and with the shrooms, caramelized onions, and provolone, that was a fantastic burger!    Chris was our server, and when we were trying to guess where he was from due to his accent, I finally just asked him.  He said, \"Cyprus\", and oh my God, my dining companion then just started talking to him in Greek and they had a whole back and forth thing.  I had no idea what they were saying, but it was pretty cool to witness.  He said he rarely runs into someone he can converse with like that.  I didn't want to tell him she only learned Greek to meet men on her vacations!  BAHAHAHA!  I'm just kidding.    No I'm not.  She has a boyfriend on every island.  So then I had to take my Mr. back this morning for brunch.  It just doesn't get much better than this for sure.  We started with the hummus nachos, because you should, you really should.  He then had the Morning burger and I ordered the chicken & waffles.  We went halvsies on everything and it was a great brunch.  I think their burgers might be the best I've had in this city so far.  It's a close contest between them and Fibber Magees/Skeptical Chymist's rasher burger.    A medium rare juicy burger with cheese, bacon, AND an egg?  Yep.  Heaven!  The waffle was so nice and light, perfectly fried chicken, and the cinnamon butter with the syrup is a nice touch.    He had a tripel and I had their coffee, which was fantastic as well.  Lovely, rich flavor.  That brunch is leaving me fat and happy for the entire day.  I can't wait to go back.  Chris was our server again today and he is really wonderful.  Attentive and funny without hovering over us too much.    The only thing I don't like is the music tends to have a lot of thumping bass, and I just don't care for that.  Especially at the end of a long day, after dealing with my high maintenance boss, I really don't want dance music thumping in my brain.  And the music was a little aggressive at brunch.  I think that belongs after 9:00 p.m. when the youngsters are all coming out, and the old men who like to hit on youngsters, and they are looking for someone to rub up against for the night.  Not really the right music for brunch or happy hour in my opinion, BUT that won't keep me away.  Stellar place!  Now that we've been, we'll be back many more times.",

I always hate going places around Tempe for the parking and too many college kids but this place is fantastic ! Parking is so easy and there was a good variety of different age groups there. They have a cute patio that is pet friendly !   My friend and I sat at the bar and the bartender ( I didn't catch his name) was very friendly and attentive. He was helpful when we were picking out cocktails . She got the spicy berry margarita and I got the fig and thyme. We both said our drinks were very different , unlike something we have ever ordered , but we liked that ! They were tasty ! we also ordered the hummus nachos with cucumber; delish and light. We also couldn't help ourselves and ordered the Fudge lava divine and it was divine. This is definitely for a chocolate lover! It is very rich but was just what we needed .   My co workers and I will ABSOLUTELY be back and I can't wait to try out more on the menu, all looked delicious and I know their service will always be great !",

In addition as soon as we walked in the door we were ignored by two employees talking. It's used to be much better. We didn't stick around to order food. We didn't want to chance the food quality going downhill too.  Update - Manager reached out to me and tried to remedy the situation. I greatly appreciate the effort and perhaps we'll give it another shot soon.",

Normally they stop serving from the full menu but they told me they would honor it and they did!  I ordered the Peach Puzz Fizz, delicious! My date ordered Death in the Afternoon. Phew It was strong, but he really liked it.  For entrees we ordered the Bacon Wrapped Filet Mignon which was cooked to perfection and was melt in your mouth delicious. The Spicy Beer Braised Shrimp was unlike anything I have had before. Spicy but not overpowering, the sauce tasted amazing when the bread that accompanied the dish was dunked in it.  Just fantastic.  Then the best part came, the smores. Who doesn't love them?  It was the prefect ending to an almost perfect restaurant experience.   I say almost because the only minor incident I had was when the waitress saw my drink at half full, she asked if I wanted another one. I said no and she walked off with my class! Maybe she thought I was done? Anyways when she came back i explained to her I wasn't done and she quickly apologized and brought me another one on her.  She was very kind and gracious. This is my new favorite place! Can't wait to come back Groupon or not",

This place is family owned and operated so you are actually eating Mom's homemade food when you dine here. The star of the show is the Hummus Nachos. I'm not a big hummus person, but this appetizer is yummy! Homemade hummus on a crispy pita chip, topped with red onion, feta, and pomegranate seeds... and then drizzled with a balsamic reduction. One of the tastiest appetizers I've had - it's melt-in-your-mouth good. Will be coming back again... a new favorite in Tempe.",

First off, they have bottomless mimosas which was awesome! The brunch menu had a ton of yummy items on it, but we settled on the farmhouse omelette and chicken pita. The chicken pita was quite delicious, but wasn't in love with the french fries. Would love to come back to partake in some day drinking on the patio and try one of the other delicious items on the menu.   I also love the woodwork and design of this restaurant. It is very unique and adds quite a bit to the atmosphere.",

I received great service, however, the food is a little bit more on the pricy side. I shared three appetizers with a friend and we were satisfied! Live music and a really cool ambient. We got the ravioli's, the stuffed avocado and the hummus nachos. Great for any foodie wanting to try new foods.",

We tried the hummus nachos, and those were so great! The balsamic glaze is sooooooo yummy and the feta is just strong enough! The bruschetta was great too! The goat cheese and mushroom was my favorite!!! And then I ordered the butternut squash! It was rich and delicious! I would recommend they add some texture to the dish, some flash fried Kale, some Apple, maybe some walnuts, or pumpkin seeds...... it just needs a lil something!!! And the Habanero vodka sauce pasta with goat cheese was full of flavor! The sauce had some heat and it was nicely balanced! We will be back!!!! Also try the Cucumber Mule! It's refreshing and goes down smooth!!!",

Interesting brunch menu, with a mix of basics and more unusual fare - a great omelet with chorizo, quinoa pancakes, eggs benedict with spinach and prosciutto. It's the bottomless mimosas that lure me here. We've had Jean Pierre as our server a couple of times, he's very friendly, attentive, and keeps the mimosas coming. A cute bar and booths inside, and a nice covered patio that is pretty pleasant even when the temperatures warm up. Televisions inside and out, but not obtrusive. Relaxed setting, just a great place to waste a Sunday morning. They used to have live music but haven't lately - hopefully, they bring it back. It added nicely to the ambiance.",

First, it was not anywhere near as busy as I was led to believe it would be. We made a rez for 6 (because I was told it was super busy later in the evening), but even by 7:15, only a few others had come in. Service was poor. Our waiter was nice, but after I told him a needed a few minutes to choose my entree, but that our app could get started, he never came back! We had been finished with our app for awhile before I finally flagged him down and told him we wanted to order. He also didn't come back to refill our drinks until after we were done with our meals.  As for the food...our app (fried mac-n-cheese balls) were just ok. Frankly, they were clearly overfried and were way too crunchy. My husband got a simple chicken wrap, which was ok, but my butternut squash ravioli were terrible. The menu description stated they were in an alfredo \"sauce.\" More like and alfredo pudding. It was so thick, you couldn't even see the ravioli and the sauce overpowered the pasta taste. Both of our meals were also lukewarm, which based on how not busy they were, they should have come out perfect. I didn't even eat half of my meal.  Perhaps we just hit a bad night in the kitchen, but that's really no excuse, and certainly no excuse for the service. We won't be back.",

First, we went on a wednesday night (not the busiest for restaurants) However, the staff at Salut was so friendly and welcoming when we arrived.  We had a dog with us that recently had surgery (cone of shame status) all of the staff at Salut was so nice to dog! Even took his picture to put up on their dog wall.  We sat out on the patio on a rather chilly night. The staff was so quick to put on the heater and make sure we were comfortable.  Our server, Gabby, was very friendly--loved that she gave her suggestions without being pushy :) much appreciated! The hummus was as good as she said! Delicious. We also got the chicken pita...so good. those fries with the lemon and parm was perfect. Flavor all the way here...and friendly staff to match!",

I chose a seat outside on the patio which was really cute, a little dirty and tables were bowed, probably because of the weather but otherwise,  I thought it was decorated nice and is dog friendly as well. There's a sign up that says \"bottomless mimosas\" on Sunday from 930-2. Nice! I ordered an iced-t (hibiscus) and a hummus platter while I waited. Another man came by and brought me water and asked if I'd been taken care of, (love that) and I told him I had. Our server was Nathan and he was awesome! We never needed anything and everything was fantastic. We shared the golden beet salad and the brie hive sandwich and they were both delicious. The sandwich was on toasted bread with arugula, brie, apples and prosciutto and came with their specialty fries in some kind of sauce but remained crispy. The salad had almonds,raisins, beets and an arugula spinach mix. Nathan split them both for us, too. We really enjoyed the service and food and definitely will be back!",

I switched  to the house pino noir which was perfect with the hummus nachos! My friends got a couple of reasonably priced pitchers of Rolling Rock and the Salut fries. We shared a bruchetta board which was a hit! You get a choice of 4 different bruchettas for $12. We got the garlic & roasted red pepper, fig & goat cheese (FAV!), mushroom & sundried tomatoes (OH YUMM), and pesto & tomato.   It was free s'more night also. We got two platters of graham crackers w chocolate pieces, marshmallows, metal skewers,and a hot coal pot to roast the marshmallows! Super tasty!   We had the delight of meeting the manager and even got to meet the owner. They were fun and made our night amazing. Lots of laughs and great food & drinks! We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Wow, what an incredible addition to Tempe! First time here and within about 20 min it was obvious Salut has captured the perfect combination of amazing atmosphere (sophisticated yet relaxed!), amazing service (they work as a team that's impossibly attentive, yet not overbearing!), amazing food (creative, well-crafted, fresh, tasty and inexpensive), and amazing cocktails (creative, well-crafted, fresh, tasty and inexpensive).  If you are getting the impression that we were totally impressed, you're wrong. We were blown away.  Manager Brandon is fantastic. Charismatic,  friendly, generous, genuine (yet humble and not full-of-himself or his bar)! Where else does this happen?!?  Bartenders Zac, David and Taso were equally awesome and accommodating.  We had the Malbec Turkey Burger with bacon and Greek salad, and the Grilled Chicken Panini with Bacon and Regular Fries.  Believe it or not, they offer to sell (and actually do! - someone bought one of their cool glasses when we were here) everything in the bar. Why? Because everything in there super unique and creative.  They even have wine cork hangers under the bar for purses -- and more importantly (to me), a USB strip all along the bottom side of the bar - and they have every phone charger cord behind the bar to loan you too!  They have a decent amount of indoor and outdoor HDTVs. If you're cool, they may even ask you to autograph a wine cork for their wall!!  Happy Hour 7 days a week 3pm-6:30pm. $3.50 wells, $5 wine, $4 beers, $5 cocktails as well as food specials. Reverse happy hour Sun-Thur 9-11pm. PLUS daily specials (I.e., $5 martinis on Wed).   Patio is great and huge. Hostesses are friendly too. Heck, at this point in the review you'd expect nothing less.  Do yourself a favor. Come here. Sit at the bar. You'll be blown-away by what happens next.  Enjoy.",

The food we had was very good (brie sandwich and chicken fettuccini) and the ambiance was really nice. I liked it so much that I went back the next day with my boyfriend. I had the most delicious lavender fizz cocktail. My boyfriend was a big fan of his burger. Our service was definitely not as great though. I liked this place and I will probably go back, but I wasn't a big fan of the inconsistent service and the prices were a bit steep even during happy hour.",

They have a bottomless mimosa special on the weekends and it would be worth the money if the right amount of champagne was in the glass.",

    "text": "A comedy of errors MADE RIGHT by management and staff  First the errors 1) missed reservation time by 20 minutes; 2) Waited 50 minutes for food to arrive after order; 3) served beef burger instead of turkey burger. Now for what this restaurant did right; 1) got apology from no less than 3 different people and a drink comp for missed reservation time; 2) apology from waiter and the owner for long food wait; 3) burger comp, price cut on rest of food, free appetizers on next visit, more sincere apologies; 4) Another free appetizer and apology from hostess on the way out the door. This is a textbook example of how a restaurant should handle customers when things go awry, and yes, at ALL restaurants things do happen, but it is how staff and management correct them that makes all the difference. I think the problems we experienced were due mostly the unexpected popularity of this restaurant and a crush of people at the time we visited. We will definitely be back to this restaurant for sure, they took a few bad things and turned them around and made the best of it. As for the food, well it was wonderful; the pistachio salmon was well prepared on a bed of orzo (barley) and the burger was prepared just right, the Greek fries could have used a tad more time in the fryer, but they had a great flavor with the feta and herbs on top. Keep up the good work Salut, this review would have been very different had you and your staff not stepped up to the plate.",

My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE this place - we have even found a favorite server, Raven, who remembered us on our second visit. The staff we have encountered have ALL been absolutely incredible especially management. I am vegetarian and they are always super accommodating and actually want to make sure I leave happy even though their menu has a lot of meat on it. The manager on shift has checked every  time to make absolutely certain that I got my order the way it was supposed to be. ((My favorite is the Malbec Burger sub the burger for avocado.)) We are also very partial to the mac and cheese bites as well as the hummus nachos and salut fries. I can't stand sitting outside (not just here, pretty much anywhere) but the patio is beautiful and dog friendly, which is awesome! The whole restaurant has a very good vibe and is an easy place to relax and eat a good meal for a good price for what you get. I also absolutely can't stand waiting and I think the longest I've waited here was about 5 minutes because their restaurant is so large! I have only come during dinner hours so I intend to visit for lunch to see if I see the same amazing results! (I'm sure I will). Nothing bad to say about this place ever. Keep doing exactly what you are doing, Salut!",

After that it took her another 30 min to get our food order then never came to check on us we had to ask three times for the check and a box. After this past experience I probably won't come back.",

Looks cheap until they add the extra few dollars for any protein. Menu was dirty too which is gross. I would only go back for the outside are and great greek fries. Salads are pretty bland and corn salad was about two bites. So small! Lots of other places I would rather go to. Need to work on the kitchen.",

Location is easy to get to and is far enough away from the ASU chaos.  Staff was very polite and on their game.  For an appetizer, we had the gluten free bruschetta.  Pretty tough to come by and I'm thankful they unlike so many other places have it.  I ordered the panini and very good flavor.  The Salut fries are hate them or love them and I so happen to love them. Overall, I was very pleased with my choice to come here and I happily go every other week or so when I want a nice chill place to have some good food and a glass of wine.  Cheers",
