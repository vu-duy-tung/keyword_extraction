Not only did it take a god awful amount of time to get our beers, but the $14 wings were uncomfortably undercooked and squishy despite saying \"grilled and fried\" on the menu and two of my undersized chicken tenders were strangely hard in the middle. On top of it all, these guys had half of their TVs and projectors playing some women's basketball when the sweet sixteen games were not even playing!! This \"dive\" bar doesn't even deserve that term...",

The decor is cool but you immediately feel like you've entered a bar that was purchased by some loser so his friends can have a place to drink all day. Staff seems really annoyed that your there and taking away from their hang out time. The food is disgusting. We ordered pretzel bits and they came with a bowl of cheese whiz! Maybe the drunk friends like that. Now the French fries were good but the burger was tasteless. The group I was with absolutely hated the place but I tried to keep an open mind because it's in my neighborhood. Well they made it impossible to like with how uncaring the staff was that we were there. Now the funny thing is that many people have complained about this place on Next Door so I added my review to their issues. No sooner did I do that, I got a message from the owner to go somewhere else! Never told me who he was or even asked why I didn't like it. just go somewhere else. You got it! Place won't last long!",

Today, he wasn't present and service was non existent, with the exception of the Busboy whom we had to utilize to gain the attention of the servers and to even get salt and pepper. The bartenders were either talking to each other or on their phones. The Busboy was the Hardest working employee there today. For the food, did not care for the breaded shishito peppers, no flavor, dipping sauce either. Ceviche was average but small. Meatballs and spaghetti squash were excellent however. Definitely need more craft beers on tap as well. Very disappointing as the hubby and I really liked it on the first visit. Do like the decor however.",

    "text": "Where do I start?  I was in Scottsdale on business. It was my last night in town and I wanted something good. I found this place on yelp and it was only .5 miles from my hotel so I walked over. I was immediately greeted by the owner and some of the staff. Took a seat at the bar and that's when the adventure began. The bartender presented me with a great menu and took my drink order. I had a cold beer before I knew it. So let me say this. If you are looking for fine cuisine this is not the place. If you want hearty and delicious pub style food cook to perfection, you found it. I mentioned deviled eggs (not on the menu). The bartender mentioned it to the cook and next thing you know I have 3 kinds sitting in front of me. I also ordered the spicy shrimp with mushrooms. It was a huge plate and also cooked perfectly.  So I'm having a great conversation with a couple guys that were sitting next to me at the bar. Come to find out one of them is Jason the owner of the place. He made me feel as if I was a long time patron and I belonged there just a much as the fixtures. We had a great conversation about bars, rock and roll and the Scottsdale area. Jason had to go, but I continued my evening with a couple more cocktails before my journey back to my room.  Long story short... Great food and drink, great staff, good music and no riff riff in this place. I can't wait to return to Scottsdale just to visit the Rooster!",

    "text": "I was looking for a place on Scottsdale road to meet my lady, so I went to Yelp and I found this place, it said it was Hot and New so we decided to give it a try.  It was a little difficult to find, so my girlfriend called them to find out exactly where they are and she was told;  \"THAT YOU CAN'T MISS US, WE HAVE A SHORT RED SCHOOL BUS PARKED IN FRONT WITH A GOLDEN COCK ON TOP\". The decor is a mix of medieval knight's armor, a stuffed fox w/sun glasses, a bear rug lying on the ceiling and a few video games. It's a cool decor if I just want to have a few drinks with friends and is slightly reminiscent of a 70's bar, without the smoke.  We sat down in one of the booths and a very nice young lady came over to help us. The young lady did the best she could do considering the situation; this was her first day and she just walked in five minutes earlier. She didn't know what was on the menu. Now if a place is going to be  successful they must setup a system to train their newbie's. Most restaurant/bars will have a seasoned server doing the serving and the newbie would tag along to see how its done. This way the customer gets the best experience possible with little or no hiccups and the newbie gets trained and setup for success. Our server had such a great attitude we decided to deal with it, but every question we asked, she had to ask someone else. To me this is all managements fault and the lack of attention to detail could be fatal to any business. Ask Jon Taffer!  I did take a quick look at the menu before choosing to come here, but I should have looked closer. I was looking to get a Burger and Fries, it's my base barometer when I try a new place since if you can't get this right, the other stuff probably isn't going to be right either.  After getting a menu I spotted my hamburger it was the first item listed on the top. The burger was a 6oz burger, lettuce, tomato, onion and cheese. It was $10 and came with your choice of a salad or potato chips. Wait, What Potato Chips, are you kidding me? NO FRENCH FRIES, NO ONION RINGS what are they thinking? I didn't object to the fact that I didn't get a burger and fries for $ 10, the objection was there was not a single French Fry or Onion Ring to be had not even as a side order.  Now everyone knows that there is nothing more American than Hamburger and French fries, not hamburger and potato chips or Salad. The sides that you could order were Sauteed Broccoli, Spiraled Zucchini, Spaghetti Squash and Spaghetti and red sauce. Of course everyone knows when you're going out to get your buzz on, your main thought is what healthy choices go with this high fat, high sodium, high carbohydrate food and the five domestic beers, two Scotch/sodas and two shots of Jagermeister you're about to drink.  No, I want hamburger and fries and onion rings and anything that is Salty, Crispy, Sweet, Charred, Spicy or Crunchy. This menu is just poorly planned. Additionally, we were told that it was happy hour but the only happy hour food offered were sliders for $3.00 a piece, but of course if I'm getting sliders I'm probably going to get at least three, which would have been nine bucks which happened to be the exact same price as the non happy hour menu price for three sliders, so no bargain here, again a management issue.  Now I will say the Burger was good and my lady said that the salad was better than most side salads she's had, the lettuce was crisp and fresh, the croutons were crunchy, but she really wanted French fries with her burger.  On another note; I'm posting a separate review for the Lays Company to let them know how much I enjoyed the potato chips. NOT! Here's the thing when I go to your establishment, I want you to WOW me with your attention to detail, the service and the quality of food you serve. If you want to serve potato chips, they have to be made in house and be fantabulous, not poured out of a bag, I go to Circle K to get Potato chips out of a bag.  We ended the meal by asking if they have any dessert substance. She asked a colleague and came back with the three choices, which by the way weren't listed on the menu. We opted for the Salted Carmel cake. The cake came with vanilla ice cream and was ok. However we both could tell it was a frozen store bought or food service vendor purchased cake. This was another opportunity to shine that fell short. There are so many locally sourced bakeries in the valley that will work with you to design desserts that are fresh, yummy and unique to you. If you don't aspire to be different with your food and service, then you're serving the same drinks and beers that the public can get anywhere else. At that point there is no reason for us to come to your establishment.  If you want to thrive you must improve.  I will give you a 2nd chance when your website shows the improvements in the menu.  GOOD LUCK",

We had a party of 6, you would think she would have been motivated. She came up and took an appetizer order but only asked a few of us. Next thing I new she was gone and I never got my order in. After that we sat dry with no more drinks nor did she check on us again. We got frustrated and one of us had to go up to her and tell her we need our checks and we are leaving. She didn't even care at all. She only had 4 tables including us. Management never came over to check on us or ask why we cancelled our food. This place is amateur hour. If they want to survive they need to get better servers and management needs to be on point. So disappointed in our time there. Hopefully they get it fixed. Would have loved to actually try their food.",

Your booty might not want to sit there for beers 2 and 3. Server was a female, friendly and genuine. I had a salad and the Oskar Blues Pinner. There was too much dressing on the salad but it was tasty and the portion was generous. My friend had the wedge salad. He loved it. We shared the lavosh; also delicious. Service was spot on. It was kind of quiet but the other customers seemed like regulars, from a neighboring business. They sat at the bar. There was a child present, seemed like the son of a server. He was back and forth in the back. And there was an older (in their 60's) couple making out in a booth.  Entertaining. Bathroom was clean. I'd go back.",

Upon suggestion from the owner, we started with the havarti lavash, which was essentially an awesome, thin pizza.  The decor was crazy cool.

Best french dip in town and their grilled wings are great. Pretty much everything on the menu is tasty. The owner, Jason, and the bartenders/waitresses are always right there when you need them. They also have good live acts every week. They had a Hendricks cover guy there this past Thursday and he was awesome. Can't recommnd this place more. Love it!",

    "text": "We came after golf on a Friday and were a little surprised that they did not offer a happy hour. Then again this place is pretty much a bar that has really good food so we kind of understood that would not make sense for them.  The staff was all super nice, attentive and knowledgeable about the food options.  We ordered the meatball platter and for $9.50 it was a pretty good value with three large meatballs, lots of tasty and chunky marinara and melted cheese. Instead of automatically serving you bread or pasta with it they offered a two dollar up charge to add a side dish or bread. We got nothing and were happy as we were saving ourselves for other items on the menu.  Next we ordered the Boursin burger (with caramelized onions and lots of bacon) medium. It came out nearly well done and we did not return it but it had good flavor and the french fries were amazing as others have mentioned.  Our third order was the hot and sweet wings as recommended by Joe our server at the bar. He was right, they took the base buffalo wing to a new level with the hint of honey. They are baked and then grilled so they are not greasy but yet moist. It would be nice if they were a little bit crispier but they did taste very good.  While we were enjoying our wings we saw a staff member sit at the bar with a couple of other patrons. We then noticed a pizza stand and then a medium size what looked like an extremely thin crust pizza come out to them. We asked our server Joe about it and he said that it was actually a large lavash cracker with melted white cheese and pieces of meatballs on it. It had no tomato sauce. Well the staffer sitting with the patrons turned out to be the chef and lo and behold about 10 minutes later they brought us a small version of the same pizza on the house. It was delicious! Being from Chicago we are used to extremely cracker like, thin crust pizza. This totally filled the bill! Joe said you can order it with any toppings. They must not want to sell a lot of these because they call it lavash and don't even mention the word pizza in the menu description. Maybe there are too many people that don't know thin crust pizza out here and would be surprised and disappointed if they called it pizza. We can guarantee you that if they're from Chicago they would know exactly what it is if it was listed as cracker thin crust pizza.  There are plenty of TVs to watch sports and the only thing we didn't care too much for were the extremely small seats on the high stools at the tables across from the bar.  The ambience is definitely a sports bar with extremely elevated food. It still had a slight grungy atmosphere to it (lots of tattoos etc. on the staff) so don't expect anything more upscale than a bar-like feel. If we were in that area again and hungry we would probably return and get that lavash \"pizza\".",

That doesn't seem like much but really makes you feel welcome. We've both been in the industry for 20+yrs so our standards are high & The Rooster's staff was on point! Andy was fantastic, down to earth and perfectly attentive. He treated us as if we had been coming in for years.   The Bloody Mary's were awesome & the food... SO GOOD!  We had the buffalo chips, fried chicken sandwich & the Reuben with the best crispy fries. My only complaint is that it's not in Chandler but we'll make the trip!

    "text": "Went here on Friday early evening and sat on the patio. Such awesome vibes from the moment we walked in. You kind of think \"oh just another pub\", but it's so far from that. Sweet interior, amazing food (finally a place that serves shoe string fries!!!!) and so many staff going around to tables, including ours, making sure everyone was having a good time. The food was so good but the service is what will make us come back. Mary was our server and she was so sweet and efficient even though she had a ton of tables. My hubby spilled his beer by accident and Mary was so quick to clean up his mess and even after he said no worries about getting another one, as it was his fault, she still brought him a new one. Little touches like that are what keep people happy!!!!! The owner of this place could really teach others a thing or two. Glad we found this place.",

    "text": "Pretty cool vibe in this place, the staff and owner make you feel at home, which is important in a neighborhood bar. The menu is eclectic, from sliders and bruschetta to ceviche and burritos, to sandwiches and small dinner plates. I had the sliders, there are two types: traditional burger type and meatball type. The burger type was very good. However the meatball slider was simply wow. Very good recommendation by our server, Bobbi. My son had one of the meatball sliders as well and definitely concurred. He also ordered the ceviche, which I sampled. Perhaps the best ceviche I've had at a bar. Spicy, but not to hot, not swimming in sauce with plenty of substance.  Like the menu, the decor is also eclectic. But it works for me. The only reason it didn't get a 5 is a pet peeve of mine. We went for a mid-week lunch, and while it wasn't super busy, neither was it empty. They had a single server working the tables, as well as the bar. The owner was working the crowd, which is good, but imho, there were times it would have been nice to have seen him helping his server out. While we were not displeased with our service, she was attentive and we never had to wait more than a minute or so for her attention, she was stretched to her limit. Perhaps this was an aberration, as the owner seemed very attentive to the clientele, when I go back, I'll watch for this.  Regardless, the only other issue is finding it. It's kind of in a funky location in a strip mall in between Thunderbird and Acoma on Scottsdale Road. The strip mall is in two tiers: those establishments fronting Thunderbird, and then another row of retail further back from the road on the other side of the parking lot. This is where Rooster's sits. I'll definitely be going back.",

They sit on the corner of a strip mall (old Dilly's Deli) The vibe when we immediately walked in was welcoming & warm. We sat at the bar, surprisingly next to someone we knew. Our drink orders were taken immediately. The decor is eclectic & cool. They have a bear rug hanging on the ceiling above the bar. They have a motor cycle in the restaurant along with a ski ball game. We met Jason (the owner) who was very friendly & funny. I like that he mingles with his customers. We ordered their grilled chicken wings. They were delicious. The guy next to me had the meatballs, they also looked delicious. The only thing I would like to see change, is having more micro brews available, not just Kilt Lifter. We will definitely be back.",

I asked him what was good here, and what he specialized in. He told me that he knows how to make all kinds of drinks. And he said it with a straight face. So I decided to go for an old-fashioned. I opted for a well whisky, which I wish I'd upgraded to a familiar name. But the Old Fashioned was spot on. Not too sweet, not too bitter. Literally halfway in-between, which is what you want. Good, clean taste. Bartender guy knows what he is doing!  Next I opted for the meatball slider. Giant meatball with sauce, nestled between a very soft pretzel bun. Never had anything like this before, and I was an instant fan  I then opted for the fried fish taco. For three bucks, I got two pretty large peices of fish in one taco with cabbage, and a mystery yellow tartar sauce (something of a honey mustard tartar?). I definitely got my money's worth with this taco. There was enough fried fish in there for two tacos, actually. So for $3, you definitely get a good deal.   I could of stopped eating with those two selections, but the wings and the French dip were well-reviewed, so I dug into my stomach reserves, and made some extra space. And boy did it pay off!   Wings with buffalo sauce were total winners. These are baked then grilled wings. Because frying wings is not the right way to do things. Size of the wings was medium, and the taste of the chicken was very flavorful and moist. The last thing you want is over-cooked wings, which happens all-too-often. And you don't want inedible wings, which are dipped in a sauce that's too over-poweringly spicy. Buffalo was just spicy enough to give a kick, but not too spicy to require a glass of milk.   Monday night here is trivia night, and the deejay for the trivia was a pretty cool guy, and several people were playing. I feel this is the kind of place you can go to, be left alone, have fun, and enjoy good food and drinks for a reasonable price.   If I was local to Scottsdale, this would be one of my weekly go-to hotspots",

I've tried a few things, but we always get the fish and chips on Friday and it's really good (according to my husband) ....served with crisp thin fries and coleslaw. I love the meatballs with spaghetti squash for a side, and I bring home an extra side of that yummy squash almost every time. I enjoy a crisp cold glass of rose with that, too! I tried the Mac and cheese but it was runny and not very hot. Won't do that one again, but we will be back to the Rooster!

The food was less than desirable, when our server came by to ask if everything was ok ? I actually said no , I thought that maybe he could tell because my burger had to be taken apart and have this gross white stuff taken off etc. I asked what is this stuff? The food is awful ,He had replied it was the cheese for the burger I said oh ok didn't offer to get me something or have any explanation or any thing else and just walked  away. Ok what is the point of asking how our food is if your not gonna do anything to make it right ? I had to dissect my burger just to be able to choke it down. My cousin had ordered a chicken sandwich although it looked delicious he said it was just meh ? The atmosphere was loud, and filled with a bunch of old lushes in the middle of the afternoon I would hardly call this place a restaurant but describe it more as a local bar. Which is fine if that's what your into , but if your looking to go an enjoy a nice lunch with a nice atmosphere and good food there are many other great choices around in the same plaza or down the street at the quarter.",

We experienced terrible service as the waitress was not attentive considering it was not busy for a Saturday night. Long story short, we cancelled our food and went elsewhere. My friend had already left a comment on Yelp and on Facebook about our experience so I was not going to. However, after the response he received from Rooster, I feel compelled to leave a comment about our dissatisfaction with this establishment. The gentleman who replied was informal as he used young kid 'lingo' when responding. But he seemed apologetic and many of us have worked in the food industry before. We know there are good nights and bad nights. We were willing to give this place another go in the future until the gentleman felt the urge/need to leave a snide remark at the very end of his reply. Sir, you are in the service industry. There are going to be rough days when you will have a customer comment that you may not like/ agree with. However, you do not respond by insulting your guests, especially not online when future guests will be turned off by the bad attitude. The appropriate move would have been to approach our table when the server informed you a party was cancelling their order. But we were not approached so the issue remained unsolved and that is the reason why you have disappointed guests. We ended up driving five minutes up the road to Four Peaks. We had impeccable service and the manager heard what an awful experience we had at the Rooster so he brought us dessert on the house. Four Peaks will get our business in the future due to their outstanding service and attentive workers.",

When we got there he had 2 booths ready for us. This was perfect since half of our group were kids, they sat at one table and adults at another table. (Side note: for a \"bar\" type atmosphere it was mild enough for kids, however we are pretty kickback about stuff like that. Some might feel it isn't really kid friendly) I digress, the waitress was the only one there taking care of the entire restaurant but we never were neglected and everything we ordered came out quickly and correct. Holy cow the food was awesome! Wings had great flavor, burgers were juicy and huge, tacos were bomb! As we were leaving Jason came by and asked us how everything was and gave us his card and said to call him if we ever want to have a party or have any issues at the restaurant. Service was great, food was excellent, and the price was reasonable. It was a great start to our staycation!",

Great food, I suggest trying the meatball sliders and the bruschetta. It's a great neighborhood place and you feel like \"Norm\" when you walk in.  Strongly urge you to go there!",

They always have Hamm's drafts for 3 bucks, but one of those is about the limit on bad beer. Otherwise, I tried the pretzels and cheese for $6.99, which was an unusual presentation. The pretzels were cut in pieces, toasted and buttered and garlicked. It was a crunchy dip into the cheese bath and worth the price. Plenty of TV sets, daily specials and unusual decor make this place a good stop in the Scottsdale bar world, but mostly for regulars.",

I can't really put my finger on it, but would agree with other reviews that it's like an upscale dive bar!  Our server was Jessica & she was great! Super nice & helpful! We had a lot of food (hanger had set in). We ordered a cup of the chicken soup (chef's special) that was bomb, the meatball plate with a side of spaghetti that was delicious! The pasta was cooked well also. My husband had the buffalo chicken wings with ranch & an order of their buffalo chips-he said it was all delicious & the buffalo sauce had a kick, but not too spicy. Their wings are baked instead of fried, which was nice! My husband also ordered a single crispy fish taco. Yes, just one and he absolutely loved that too!  I'd definitely return here and would especially recommend for the crispy fish tacos!",

A quick warning about the buffalo chips - they are SHARP!  The hubby loved the taste - I was only down for a few because I am a wimp!  I ordered the lobster mac and cheese an HOLY WOW was it fantastic.  Huge chunks of lobster and so much food I took home a doggie bag.  We will definitely come back.

Maybe shame on me for ordering lobster in the desert southwest, but I made sure to let the server know that it was not  to anyone's liking.  I would have expected him to offer to replace it with a different dish, or take it off the bill, as 85% of it was left on the plate when it was taken from the table.  No such courtesy was offered.  Maybe it was just this one server, on this one night,  but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth, both literally and figuratively.  Unfortunate, because the rest of the food we ordered was pretty decent.",

    "text": "Had been here 4 times previous and had solid 4 star experience.  Brought some friends having told them it was a great place.  In the past, owners seemed to be in the house and things ran well.  First, they were under staffed, so the nice waitress really struggled getting drink orders then our orders.  Took forever for order of wings to arrive.  When they did, half  were burned black and inedible.  When we pointed it out to the waitress she first seemed not to know what to do then said she'd get us some new ones.  What she brought was five flat wings to replace the number she thought were burnt.  When our sandwiches arrived very much later, my Ruben was not toasted and the corned beef was full of gristle and impossible to eat. The fries were like pieced of wood and terrible.  When I asked for a manager, they said we don't have one, but we could talk to the bar tender.  I explained all the issues and their solution was to pay for our 2 drinks.  Maybe they just had a bad night, but for me I'm done. I eat out 100's of times per year.  This was the worst experience I have had in recent memory.  Beware of the 4.5 star as I believer it will be trending south.",

I loved the description \"luxury dive bar.\" The food was amazing- tacos, chicken sandwich, fish sandwich, and especially the fries. The wait staff and owner were personal and even gave my husband a birthday shot.",

The inside is so well designed we felt right at home the minute we walked in. The decor is beautiful and very interesting. The staff is attentive and very accommodating. Carly the waitress and Charlie who does a little of everything, are so dang cute. Everyone there is so friendly. We love the MIND ERASER MENU, that is totally something we have never seen before, and we have been mind eraser drinkers for a long time. Be sure to try 1 when you are there! The Lavosh is off the hook good as well.. It comes 2 different ways and we will try the Tuna tomato next time we are there. Great place to hang out and meet people that's for sure. Thank you all for making us feel so welcome! Welcome to the neighborhood! Can't wait to go back for another round of Mind Erasers!",

We should have switched, as I preferred his wings, and he loved my sandwich! Well, to each their own. I ordered a glass of red wine, which was served ice cold. I just asked that it be given a twenty second nuke, and it was much better! All in all, if we found ourselves in Scottsdale again, we'd have no compunction about visiting the Rooster again.",

We went inside the tavern and found a loud (in a good way), active, happy crowd.  I asked to see the menu and Rico, the person serving as host, gave us information on the menu and the special of the day:  All you can eat codfish.  He was super, friendly and so likable that we decided to stay.   We ordered beer, All u can eat cod dinner and a burger with a salad.  They give you the choice of salad instead of french fries. The cod was delicious, crispy and not greasy. The burger was a half pound burger with the usual toppings.  The meat was fresh but the burger needed a good char on the outside to impart better flavor.   The vibe was great.  Music started at about 8 PM which was nice, but it was very hard to have a conversation (actually even before the music) since the place was packed. Jessica was our most charming server--helpful, attentive and friendly.   Congrats to Rico (who I understand is the chef) for enticing us to try The Rooster Tavern.  See u soon.",

First time here and I wish I could take it back. I can't say enough bad things about this place. If you want to enjoy a time out with friends, pick another place because this one isn't worth your time or money.",

    "text": "The coolest dive bar!  Came here on a Saturday night to watch the ASU game with some friends...the atmosphere is so unique and fun! We walked in, most of us wearing some type of ASU gear, the owner asked if they were playing- we said yes and he told us where to sit so we could get a good spot to watch the game from the TV's that had the channel available AND then he came by and switched another one to the channel so we could see the screen from a few angles at this big round table. Nicest guy and that made for an immediate great 1st impression and experience!  We ordered the pretzel and cheese appetizer and a round of beers. Lots of draft options and fully stacked bar.   I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich (chicken, pesto mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion on a bun) with fries. One of my friends ordered the same thing and then the other members of our group ordered meatball sliders, burgers, and the French dip.   Everyone was really happy with the food! It came out hot the fries were awesome! The chicken sandwich has a great piece of chicken on it. We both mixed it with a little ranch because the pesto flavor didn't really seem present in the pesto mayo; overall I'd definitely get it again though.   Another great part- they had a guy performing acoustic guitar and singing and he was phenomenal! He played classic rock, country, and many other great tunes!  For a first experience here, this place was top notch! It got really busy as we were getting ready to leave and we could see why- great service and food. There are so many options on the menu too-we'll definitely be back to try out some other things!",

My gf had the fried fish sandwich which was also tasty but my sandwich was better (because men make better decisions when it comes to food) lol we both had spicy margaritas and we're HUGE tequila and spice fans and the wale tequila actually was pretty good. Kudos to them for hooking us up. Service was what you would expect from a bar/tavern type of joint so no complaints. The ONLY complaint I have is that they have a guitarist who is pretty terrible and who is EXTREMELY loud to the point you have to yell to have a conversation. But other than that it's a great place to chill, hang and have drinks.",

The sauce that came on the plate was limited and shuttle in flavor but added some additional taste to it.   I got to try a bite of the Boursin Burger. Solid burger based on the bite I had. The others at the table who ordered it really enjoyed it. The temps were a little off (med rare was more a med/med well).   I had the Hatch Green Chili Hash with a couple of eggs added. As a huge fan of Hash I ordered with great hope and I was not disappointed. This is a great Hash!  The flavor of the Green Chili's added a ton to this dish. The Hash was perfectly cold with the potatoes not too soggy or hard. The flavor was fantastic. The great addition of the tortillas to sop up the juice at the bottom of the plate made sure you missed nothing.",

The bruschetta was topped with ripe marinated tomatoes and boursin cheese on top of crispy (not burned or soggy!) baguette. Peg had a very tasty tuna (albacore) melt and my French dip was NOT overly salty which can easily happen with au jus. Salads were fresh and the Caesar dressing was terrific.

This place came up. We had the kiddoes with us (11 & 15) on a Sunday afternoon and hoped the place lived up to the reviews.  Tables were empty but the bar seemed full.  We waited for what seemed like 15 minutes with no server to be found.  We were about ready to leave when someone came over and asked if we wanted to see a menu.  What?!?  Service was just OK- food was great.  We knew that we weren't \"regulars\" but we didn't expect to feel like outsiders.  Not sure if we will return for the food because the service was blah.",

I got two meatball sliders, one burger slider, and my fiance got the tacos.   Meatball sliders are what puts this place at 5 stars . I make a damn good meatball myself .... and these were on point if not better than my own .   Tacos were solid too and the atmosphere of the place is just wacky and fun .

I like to read a places lowest yelp reviews first to get a feel for what people whine about.   After seeing the \"books\" a few people left on yelp about this place, I assessed this has to be the place for me.   I was spot on.  My first bite into the meatball slider we ordered took me straight to \"Pizza Rock\" in downtown Vegas (favorite place there to late eat and get a great beer).  So tasty and tender!!!  The wings are baked and char finished on the grill, just like I do them at home!  Buffalo sauce was popping with flavor.    We split the French dip and fries for the entree.  Fries were so crisp on the outside and mashed potato-like on the inside like fries should always be done!  The horse radish sauce and the au jus are a perfect accessory to this sandwich and did not disappoint.  I know it was a fluke, but we got a large tough piece of meat in the sandwich.  Thinner slices would easily remedy that from happening.    Over all I am extremely happy to have a great hangout for football season so close to my house!  Great work on this gem of a tavern!!",

The main motivation for coming here was proximity to home and the positive feedback it was receiving.  I understand it is a neighborhood bar with all the basic bar food, but it was so basic it was lackluster.  On a quiet Monday eve there were maybe half a dozen patrons, yet service was incredibly slow. Server seemed distracted and uninterested, I believe he may have been the bartender. Other people delivered our food and/or checked in on our table. At the end of my sojourn there we waited in vain for our check - which the server had forgotten about.  Buffalo wings that were ordered were incredibly dry and lacked the anticipated buffalo sauce. Even the sides of ranch and bleu cheese dressing were missing the key ingredient of flavor.  The buffalo meatballs, drenched in a buffalo and bleu cheese sauce, were disappontingly dry and flavorless.   No selection of drafts to be had here, and most of the beer offerings on the wall were domestics like bud and coors.  For a local tavern, I guess I expected there to be a more decent beer selection.   And that if the food offerings were known and customary bar food dishes, like wings, that there would be more of an emphasis on making those the best damn wings you have ever had.  Finally, no one cared whether we were there or would ever come back.  Honestly, I will often give a business my patronage just because the service rocks. This one, unfortunately, needs some work in all areas.",

I had the meatball sliders which were pretty good but they were really soggy.   Our waitress only came by once after we were served our food which by then the chicken sandwich was cold.  I think this place has a lot of potential. It's super cute and decorated really cool. Because they recently opened maybe there are some kinks to work out.

It's cleverly hidden behind Sapporo and RA sushi off Scottsdale and Thunderbird so now you were to find it! It's a friendly place, if you are as well, I sat at the bar and met two great ones! Bobbie and Tony were very attentive. I could tell there were a few friends/already regulars enjoying the place! I had the meatballs! Very good! The fare is tavern food as you should expect by the name! It's quality food at a good price. By 6:30 the bar stools were filling up so others obviously like the place as well. Happy hour is 3-6. $1 off wine well and domestic draft. It's a quick happy hour....but maybe that will change? For the physically disadvantaged, they have a drop down bar near one end! Yep, roll your wheelchair up and belly up! Not required by law but a nice touch! I will be back!",

The wings are fresh, baked, grilled and outstanding. Very tender and juicy. A bit pricy for wings, but worth it. The meatball and burger sliders on the pretzels rolls were very good as well. We had a side of spaghetti squash, which shows the diversity of their menu. Great live music and house rock and roll music when the one man band is not playing. We will be back. This is a gem in Scottsdale and Jason, the owner, welcomed us and really cares about the customer experience.",

The Decor is really cute and great artwork.    I had asked for happy hour and proceeded to order a beer for my husband I didn't want beer so I asked for a specialty drink suggestion.  The waitress was very friendly and suggested an elephant margarita, I agreed and she brought it out.    We ended up having the lavash pizza--they were out of mushrooms apparently, then I ordered of the spaghetti squash--they were out of the spaghetti squash too apparently, so we ordered a very boring kale Caesar salad.  The pizza was pretty good though the crust was nice and crunchy.  Then the bill came.  I could not understand why our tiny order was $50.  As it turns out my margarita was 20 bucks!!!  I never would've ordered it had I known the price.  The waitress was very friendly but I think she should have at least let me know the price before I placed the order.  It's a very cool looking dive bar, but I didn't expect any sort of exorbitant prices.  I would've had a great time and overall experience if it weren't for this drink price issue.  I just wanted a decent drink to unwind after a very long stressful day :(",

I have driven by this place several times. When I walked in, the vibe I got was it felt like I was walking into a filming of an episode of Bar Rescue.   We followed instructions on a sign that said seat yourself, after sitting down for about 3 minutes someone who was sitting at the bar having a drink walked up to our table and handed us menus and said she would locate our server for us. A minute or two later our server, whom I felt was the saving grace, came and took our drink orders. Shortly there after, a younger gentleman came by and literally dropped two cups of water on our table and we said how are you to him and he just walked away without acknowledging our question.   I felt that our waitress was very attentive, she recommended a dish and we decided to order her recommendation. When the food had come out, I felt that it was missing something to take it the extra step and bring it over the top. After eating our meal for about 15 minutes a gentlemen approached our table to check on us and he seemed to be intoxicated. It gave me an uneasy feeling.   This experience was disappointing after reading all the great reviews. I do not believe I will be returining",
