    "text": "As you can tell from my profile, I'm not one to write a bad review - if you don't have something nice to say...But I can't stop myself from sharing my experience at Quiessence - especially when considering the price.  On our anniversary, I thought it would be great to take her to a high-end spot like Quiessence.  I looked at the reviews (first time social media has let me down), it looked legit, and I set it up without telling her.  I made a reservation, let them know it was our anniversary asking for a nice table and offering to pay a little more if there was something special they could do.  For our near $300, here's what \"special\" means:  - A table by the door. I seriously can't believe they cram a table there, everyone who walked in was basically on our lap. - After taking our drink order, it took 20 minutes before our waiter returned, and with just one of the drinks. - We ordered, received our appetizers in ok time, and then waited another 40 minutes until our meals began coming out (we ordered special courses - big mistake) - Each dish came out somewhere between warm to cold, for sure sitting around -  Even if warm, the quality was not anywhere near the caliber of what a similarly priced meal at any other high-end establishment around town would be. - Tip was included in the bill at over 18%  Seriously, unreal, when expressing our disappointment, we received a \"sorry.\"  Even if it was an off night, there's just too much here to ignore. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!",

    "text": "My wife and I spent nearly $300 and were extremely disappointed with the food and the experience. I can't think of a time in a supposedly high-end restaurant when I just wasn't able to finish each course primarily due to the blandness and unoriginality  of the food.   1. The opener was a ceviche that featured a tough, metallic flavored scallop that made both of us wonder if we were going to end up in the ER (we are HUGE ceviche fans :(    2. The sausage entree was so forgettable that I actually forgot to eat most of the links.  3.  The small meatballs with gnocchi from a taste perspective rivaled some of the frozen selections from Trader Joes. Average and forgettable.  4. Both desserts were chocolate and were good, but nothing special.  5. We noticed that the hostess kept seating customers including ourselves in the back room near the bathroom (which smelled terribly and looked as though it was in need of a cleaning). The maitre d' left most of the tables in the best part of the restaurant empty for the majority of the night. No comprendo.  6. Our server was friendly, but seemed disinterested and on two occasions plates were slapped down on our tables with no verbal description (where is the passion and interest! This is part of the tasting menu experience!)   7. Timing of the food and wine flight was off. With the exception of the Justin port, the wine selection was average and not a good value.  My wife couldn't stop talking about how poor the food was the entire ride home. Not a great way to celebrate our Valentines' Day.  Bottom line - this is our second time at Quiesscence and definitely the last time. What an utter disappointment.",

I had been there a few times before they re-opened, and I have to say it's even better than it was before. If you had been there before (and loved it or hated it) give it another try with the new chef, and I promise it won't disappoint. From the cocktails (I recommend the grapefruit one with the fennel!), to the food and service, everything was great.   Since we had a larger group we ordered almost all of the starters and had no complaints, but the pastas and maya's forged garden were to die for.  I didn't try it but everyone was raving about the bone marrow luge as well. For my entree I had the pork chop, and I really think it may have been the best pork chop I have ever had.  It was a good sized portion as well, I definitely recommend it.  We were stuffed after dinner but couldn't pass up on the desserts.  The lemon tart was definitely a favorite!  Overall, it was a great dinner and I will definitely be back!!",

    "text": "I had such high expectations for this restaurant. My husband took me here for my birthday. The food was great, but the experience was not what I expected. The restaurant was behind with seating people. The hostess directed us to their wine bar and made us wait over 10 minutes for our table. The restaurant was about 1/4 full. Once we sat down, we ordered the tasting menu with the wine pairings. We waited 30 minutes for our first course, then the soup was served before we even finished the first course. The waitress made them take it back. Subsequent courses were served without the wine pairing and we had to ask for it. The entree took another 20 minutes to arrive. For my birthday they plopped a macaroon down on the table and it was just very awkward. We spent a lot of money on the meal and I expected the manager to comp some of our drinks based on how bad the kitchen timed the service of our meal. It wasn't our waitresses fault, but something should have been said to the chef. It should not have been a 4 hour meal. Food was great, but the pacing was really bad.",

I had heard some people talk about it but mostly it was complaints about the price, so I had negative feelings about the place to start.   Upon arriving all I can say is it's not much to look at from the dirt driveway. But once we entered, we were greeted by several extremely friendly hostesses and waitresses. Hands down the restaurant had a fantastic warming, and inviting feeling about it. We were put at ease and that was good because this is part of its charm. The full experience lasted 3 hours.   For dinner we did a full service chef choice thing where they picked for us the wine and food that is perfectly paired. I'm not much on wine but everything seemed to be better w/ the combination. I had no complaints about the food at all. Perfect. When the bill came I had no problem paying the $300 or so because it was well worth it. Taste, portions, service. All A+   on a side note, we went all out and there are a lot of less expensive items on the menu so price is relative to what you order. The Assume service is shared by everyone.",

I wasn't a fan of my poached sausage entree; which was an alternative pick as they ran out scallops, my first selection.  Strange location in the woods. Lots of foul smell as you approach.

I was a little caught off guard by the price tag, but that's my fault for not doing a little more research up front.  The appetizer, salad and entree cost us $70 for one person.  We don't drink alcohol, so that would have spiked our meal cost even more.  If you are looking for a unique experience and cost is secondary, then this is a nice place to have dinner with that special someone.  If a quality food experience relative to the cost is a big factor (as it is for me), then look elsewhere.",

We spent hundreds (no alcohol) which would have been fine but the appetizers were small for the cost, like a table spoon of each type of cheese, there was 5 of us and we just wanted to each taste a little. The salad took an hour, the staff kept asking me it had come out. We waited 2 hours for our entrees to the point the waitress looked like she was going to cry. Once our food came I thought it would be fantastic. No the meat was over cooked. For the price they charge I was sure it would be perfect. The steak came sliced so it was slightly cold and not very juicy. I had to ask for ice for my water may because we were there for so long it kept melting and almost 4 hours later I could believe I left with out dessert. We stopped at DQ because we were still hungry? Ugh so sad because I wanted to love this place! We go to the farm a lot.  DO NOT BRING KIDS! We loved talking but I think they got restless and bothered the people around us. They are 10, 16 & 22. I can't imagine small children!",

The Pros: Fantastic ambiance Knowledgeable wait staff The yam-stuffed raviolis are to die for (some of the other reviews mention them as well) Excellent assortment of local and small California wines Excellent home-made salamis  The Cons: They killed, and I mean KILLED my NY Strip steak. Past well done. Sawdust. You just dont do that in a $300 place. My 12 year old does that. Didn't offer to re-do it, but wanted to get me \"something else\"? WTH?? Like I dont know what sawdust in my mouth is and what a NY strip is supposed to taste like? The halibut was under cooked as well.  One of the wine courses didnt come out with the meal course. They added a automatic 18% gratuity. Even on the alcohol. You just dont do THAT either.  So go for the atmosphere and anything \"tuscany\", but stay away from anything else. For a \"high end\" place they fall short. Go to Fleming's or something instead if you want better all around food. Dont say we didnt warn you.",

    "text": "I hardly ever write a bad review, but I feel so compelled to warn anyone who is looking for a great dinner to not waste their money here! There are so many better options in Phoenix.  We went a couple weekends ago, had a reservation and had read great things about the place.  This place has SUCH potential for a home run considering the wine selection, menu and most importantly the location on the farm.   We got there right at our reservation time and were greeted.  The hostess let us know that it would be about 10-15 minutes and directed us into the restaurant to the 'wine bar'.  This is when we began to wish there was an instruction guide to this place...it was not clear where to go for the wine bar and when we finally found someone to ask, she brought us a wine list and had us stand right smack in the middle of the dining room to look over the list. After we ordered a bottle of wine, we went outside to sit and wait.  The wine was great and there was a fire outside. After about 15 more minutes we were seated.  The table was in a weird spot right next to a door that wait staff were coming in and out of constantly.   In the restaurant, the atmosphere was odd...I don't know exactly how to explain it.  It was quiet, but almost too quiet, like awkwardly quiet.  We saw wait staff walking about and helping customers and after 10 minutes we were still waiting for someone to come to our table.  I finally go the attention of the hostess and she apologized and sent someone over.  He was friendly but kept forgetting to bring water, we got the bread about half way through the meal, and he took about 20 minutes to get our check.  The food was decent, but compared to places like Kai, T.Cooks, Binkleys, not at all worth the money.  They have this plate with salted meats, cheese, etc. which is per person...so for the 2 of us it was $30.  Seriously! For that price, go to Cheuvront's or Postino's!   If this was more reasonably priced, I might give it a second chance, but when you are going to spend over $200 for a meal, I'd rather go with a sure thing.  It was a really negative experience overall and the next night we did go to Cheuvront's to make up for it!",

    "text": "My wife and I celebrated our 1 year anniversary here Saturday night.  We decided to pull out all the stops and do the \"The Brick Oven Table\" thing.  They setup a nice table outside next to their brick oven and serve you an 8 course meal.  It is very intimate and if I wasn't already married my wife would have thought I was going to propose.  So if there are any guys out there looking for a good proposal spot this is probably a pretty solid place to do it.  It probably wasn't my most brilliant idea to sit outside because it was pretty hot and both of us got pretty bitten up by mosquitos and/or ants.  The hostess and waitress gave us plenty of forewarning and chances to move inside because of the heat, but we decided to stick it out because it is all part of the charm and will definitely give us an anniversary to remember.  Anyway, the food was very very good.  I can't pick a favorite because it was all good.  Yes the courses are pretty small but after 8 courses I was pretty stuffed.  Nothing that was served was overly bizarre or fru fru (as some tasting menus can get).  My only complaint is that the chef has a pretty heavy hand when it comes to salt.  I mean I love salt but some of the stuff was overly salted.  Doing the sampling menu was a great experience and gave us the full range of what Quiessence has to offer.  It truly is top notch cuisine.  Everybody from the hostess to the waitresses to the bus boys are all very professional, helpful and friendly.  I would recommend Quiessence to anybody looking to celebrate an occasion or just want a nice night out.",

The antipasto plate was divine, they only cook with local in season vegetables so it was fun to give me taste buds something a little different (think parsnips and fennel). That was followed by a salad with fresh grapefruit, local artisan cheeses, grilled vegetables, cauliflower tartar (with fried capers, red onion and grilled bread), marinated seasonal vegetables, cheese gnudi (similar to gnocchi) with romanesco and spicy crushed tomatoes and then finished with an incredible dessert.   The ambiance was great for a date but would be perfect for a group as well. Although I wouldn't recommend it for children. If it had been warmer we would have eaten outside in their pecan groves. There are also outside fire pits to warm up around.   I cannot wait until I get the opportunity to dine here again, it is now my new favorite!!",

    "text": "Disappointing Thanksgiving.  Expecting our first baby in a month, my boyfriend and I decided to splurge and let somebody else do the Thanksgiving cooking for us. I chose Quiessence based on a recommendation in the Phoenix New Times and from all of the great things I've heard about The Farm in general.   There were three sittings available: 1:00pm, 3:30pm, and 6:00- each 2 and a half hours apart (plenty of time to sit, eat, and go.. we thought).  We arrive at 3:15 to find every table still occupied from the 1:00 sitting, most patrons still eating, not even just kicking back and hanging out. We \"checked in\" at the hostess stand and stood there awkwardly until she said \"we can't start seating until 3:30\". There was no mention of where we should go in the meantime, if there was somewhere to get refreshments, or how we should expect to be contacted when seating began. (Keep in mind, I'm very pregnant, thirsty, and not interested in hovering around the hostess stand haha).  Once 3:30 rolls around, we notice there is a line of at least 20 people waiting at the hostess stand. Turns out they are going to be seated in the order in which they are hovering. Arriving early/on time/checking in was an unnecessary step and you would be given whichever table was left once you reached the front. What seemed like the manager was now at the hostess stand, literally SWEATING and visibly pissed off. He was barking orders at the wait staff, making it quite obvious that things were not going as expected.  We lucked out and got a great table outside. We were seated by the hostess who asked which type of water we wanted and said she'd be right back. Ten minutes later, we get water in two different shaped glasses because, as she explained, \"we are trying to get caught up on dishes from the first sitting, we ran out of glasses.\" Cute, Quiessence.  A few minutes later our server arrives to take our supplemental drink order. At this point we could've ordered our food too (considering there were only a handful of options for the special menu), but we could tell they were trying to make things special and not rush us. When our drinks came, we ordered all 3 courses. The first one (salad) arrived 5 minutes later! Things are picking up, right?  Meanwhile, we notice that all around us are the grumpiest patron's faces we'd ever seen. The restaurant was setting up new tables, shuffling people around, and taking food to the wrong places while we are eating and other tables are barely getting their mismatched water glasses. Ugh. Not the happy Thanksgiving vibe we were looking for.  The cocktails were spectacular! I got a virgin egg nog drink and the bf got a ginger margarita. A+  The salad was just eh. Mixed greens, beets, cheddar shreds, apples, and a vague vinaigrette.   My main (turkey) was dry and oddly shaped. It certainly did not look like it was carved from any turkey I'm familiar with. The slices were small and oblong, ringed with fat, and sort of dense and tough. There was also dark meat that actually looked real! It was very tender and swimming in gravy. The bf got Venison and said it was good, albeit half the size as my entree.  The savior were the sides: creamed greens, roasted brown-sugar carrots, whipped potatoes, and stuffing.  Unfortunately, the stuffing was dry and salty, we each stopped at one forkfull. The veggies were delicious, and the whipped potatoes were AMAZING. So good we got seconds!  Dessert choices were homemade pumpkin pie and apple crisp. Naturally, we got one of each to share. The pumpkin pie was flavorful and delicious. The apple crisp was a bowl full of warm apples, gooey sauce, and vanilla ice cream on top... no crisp to be found. I suppose if crisp sits in goo long enough, it disappears. Flavor was good though, and was about twice the size of my pie slice.   Our \"epic\" last Thanksgiving as a couple cost us $65/person plus tax and tip. It was awkward, uncomfortable, and left us wishing we had crashed somebody else's family Thanksgiving instead.   To recap:   PROs: Cocktails, ambiance, whipped potatoes, and our server. I can't speak for the other servers, but ours was working hard for her money.  CONs: Terrible planning on behalf of the restaurant. Unprofessional slapping together of tables, clearing dishes, running out of dishes, little thought put into pre-seating arrangements and checking in process. Dry turkey and underwhelming (typically easy to make) Thanksgiving staples.   Something was clearly out of sorts this day, too bad it was such a special one for so many families. I thought \"maybe this is their first go at it and they're working out the kinks\", but no, turns out they've been doing Thanksgiving for years.   Instead of making a great new Thanksgiving memory and/or tradition, we got a headache and a wallet ache. Thanks but no thanks Quiessence, we won't be back.",

We went last night to celebrate our anniversary and were treated as though we were the only couple in the entire place (which there must have been half a dozen other couples there for similar celebrations).    We opted to have the farmers feast (I had the wine pairing) and the wonderfulness began.  6 Courses: Each amazing for its own reason.  They were nicely timed so that we could enjoy each course, each wine, and eachother.  But not so spaced out that we started to wonder if they forgot about us.    So as we sat outside on the patio staring out onto the farm's scenery - like we were in our own little world where decadent plates of food would magically arrive at the perfect time.   1st Course - Salami, cheese and bread - what is a better way to start 2nd - fresh and clean salads (mine was citrus - his warm beet with goat chees)  3rd - pasta (his included rabbit meatballs, mine was similar to gnocchi but went by a different name - this was my favorite)  4th- fish (cod and rock fish . . . flakey sweet  buttery - but light)  5 - meat (venison - lamb . . . perfectly cooked perfectly seasoned)  6th dessert - (one was a ved velvet whoopie pie the other was a carrot style cake)  Each course showed up without us placing a single order - just what the chef sent out - and each was wonderful.   Thank you Quiessence for making this a special evening!!!",

If I could better recall my experience at the now defunct SeaSaw I would possibly say they fall on the same continuum.  But for very different reasons. You don't come to these restaurants for large American meals focused on confusing people of what value should mean.  This place makes you think about each bite you take, wondering what the hell it is and why does it taste so amazing?  I think I'm a pretty good cook, so I'm most impressed by dishes I don't think I can replicate.  It's not even an option here - stinging nettle anyone?    The menu really DOES change daily, you can check it online. This is a place that is centered on vegetables but recognizes most of the population likes meat.  Here, no problems regardless of dietary preferences, vegan, etc, just let them know (when making reservations).  Ordering is fun (and expensive= thanks Mom!), because you order via courses either a la carte, or their daily tasting menu, with or without wine pairing (compared to other cities, this is a great deal).  Antipasto options for everyone.  This is an incredibly innovative menu, especially for Phoenix, and such a beautiful setting.   EVERYTHING is local, and most everything is organic.  Homemade gnocchi with cheese from... (Peoria??)   Wonderful wine list, tons of awards for it, ask for a recommendation and you'll be duly satisfied.  They also run a number of seasonal dinners, usually focused on meat, always focused on local.  This is the perfect special occasion experience. If you love the safe cookie cutter restaurant scene that often seems to dominate Phoenix, this isn't for you. I'm giving it 5 stars, because when taking location and an unusual menu into consideration, there just isn't anything else like it in Phoenix.",

She said yes, and we sat down, took our jackets off, ordered our drinks, got our drinks, ready to order our meals, but she came back and said manager says we have to move since this table is for their VIP guests....I decided to leave and not to stay in such place, so we left...interesting the manager never showed his/her face.

The food was good, but very pricey and the wine list was Arizona-centric with very few from other wine regions of the world. I've noticed that in the few upscale Arizona restaurants I have been to, they really emphasize local wines, while being from NY- I hardly see NY wines on NY/NYC restaurant wine lists...hmmmm, interesting.   Anyway, my beef tartare was very good, though it was served with pickled veggies and two small cubes of (blue?) cheese which I felt were unnecessary and didn't belong...yet I hardly got any toast to put my tartare on, only two small pieces. My enree of bone-in pork belly was interesting and tasty, but way too fatty even for pork belly. Again, very pricey here- entrees average upper $30's/ low $40's...and I feel it is worth it as a one-time thing for a special occasion, but not a standout experience.",

My beet salad was amazing, when a place has the ability to grow their own ingredients the difference is obvious, super fresh and a nice melange of flavors. The beef carpaccio was sensational- tender, juicy and again divinely fresh!   Narah was my server, and she was just the right level of attentive, let us relax and never hovered excessively, that's one of my pet peeves. Unlike one of the other reviewers, I can pour my own wine and it doesn't interrupt my enjoyment of the experience. The ambiance was delightful, the food sublime and the nice manager who came to see if we were enjoying ourselves was a delight. He was also from Chicago and it was another experience of midwestern friendliness making me feel welcome so far from home.  Bravo Quiessence! I promise to come back as often as possible.",

They turned a run-down area into something trendy. However, a few things distracted from the experience...  First, the person up front ask about our reservations and had to check if our table was ready. Five minutes later, we were still standing there. A manager finally got us our seats. I liked the view of of the front yard, but the windows were dirty. There's dirty as in a few spots and then there's dirty as in hasn't been cleaned in a year. These windows looked as if they hadn't been cleaned in a good year or so. The final thing that got me was the flies. Yes, it's an old farm area, but when you have multiple flies constantly landing on your food, body, and drinks, it gets annoying! The dining experience was about 2.5 hours, and I was annoyed by flies for nearly the whole time.  I'm not sure if I would go back. If there are flies and dirty windows, I'm afraid to see what the kitchen looks like or how my food was handled...",

Just a preface, there were about 3 - 5 tables in the entire restaurant (not busy).  Pros (kinda): Coursing menu overall was great minus the bland entree, which included large amounts of broccoli (the only item I asked to not have). Looks like other reviews complain about similar misteps, one of which required an epipen.  Ambience is very nice.  Cons: The coursing menu took 3 hrs 15 min and we rushed our way at the end. That's fine if expected but insanely slow on an obviously slow night. To be honest this was the overriding factor which basically ruined the night.  Sat for 20 min until I flagged down the hostess to get a drink.  Noticeably frustrated, the staff was unapologitic. That sealed the deal to write a review.  For the price point just not worth it. For the $$$$, simply need better service.  Sorry, I rarely ever review, but maybe this critique will prepare others or get the restaraunt to speed their coursing up. There's a lot of options in Phoenix and at this point your money is better spent at many other establishmemts.",

    "text": "For starters:  I made a reservation over a week in advance.  On arrival it was a bit different than perhaps what I was expecting, it was dark and you could easily wonder if you were in the right place or if you were trespassing on private property, maybe that adds to the experience maybe it is off putting depends on the person I suppose.  So we (party of two) made our way to the hostess statio3n we were 15 minutes early for our scheduled reservation,  after waiting for 20 minutes the hostess told us it would be a short wait for a table to open up, which is not a problem and could be expected in a restaurant with such limited seating.  This however is where things went downhill, and quickly.    We waited in the bar area (really just a high top table, near the wait station) we were given a cocktail list and than waited not less than one hour before anyone asked if we would like a drink.  I will give credit where it is due and will give top marks to the drink, would have liked another but no one asked for another hour.  We were seated no sooner than two hours after our scheduled reservation.  It was pretty obvious that the kitchen was at the end of the shift and interested only in closing out the night as quickly as possible.  The cured meat selection was good, portions we're laughably small.  The rest of the meal, small, not particularly inspired, I had lamb, it was certainly well aged, and not in a good way.  I now wonder where the line is drawn between lamb and mutton.  The gnocchi was good, but  not wait two hours for it good.    The service, could be described in the following ways: absent to arrogant, I'm not sure which is worse.    In summary why take reservations if they will not be honored ?why make great cocktails if no one can order them? The included gratuity, just add it in to the actual prices if you want to provide a livable wage, factor it in to the overhead costs, that way at least the customer isn't held liable.  The prices border on the exorbitant considering the multitude of shortfalls.    And one last note: if you do not look like they seem to think affluence looks like (apparently the Ed hardy wearing type) be prepared to be passed off as incapable of affording to enjoy such a \" unique culinary experience\" maybe they should require a copy of your tax returns be attached to any reservation requests, if they want to be as high brow as they assume to be.",

Food was good, but not so good when you have to wait 45 min to an hour between courses.  Also, we finally had to have them just box the dessert so we could go home.  To top it off, they slapped on an extra 20% gratuity for the \"holiday\".  Not that it is all the servers fault that the kitchen was so slow, but gratuity is the only means a customer has of showing their appreciation, or dissatisfaction with their meal.  Unfortunately, the poor service overshadowed the food.  The $95 price tag for a 4-course meal just wasn't worth it.  I can hardly remember it and I was just there.  All we could think about is when is the next course going to get here.  We will stick with the The Farm for lunch or the Morning Glory Cafe for breakfast from now on.",

    "text": "Guys, if you wanna impress your lady, it doesn't get much more tasty or romantic than this.  Went here for Restaurant Week with a gal pal, but knew almost nothing about it.  It was a little hard to find hidden in the back of the farm area.  Once we found it, the ambience immediately blew us away.  A nice cosy cottage tucked back behind the trees, bushes, plants, and grass.  Nice music in the background and a well lit patio.  My friend and I laughed and wished we had brought dates.  Anyways to the food.  We got the Restaurant Week menu, but they have a huge 7 course tasty menu if you're game (though a bit pricey at $90).  Our 3 course meal included a cucumber salad with onions, parmesan cheese, and noodles.  It was accompanied by a small smoked salmon bite on a baked chip and covered with basil.  We also got a complimentary pumpkin bread with lemon butter (amazingly good).  Our main dish was a pumpkin squash ravioli with cherries and sausage made from scratch in house (the sausage was delicious and surprisingly light).  The desert was a triple layer chocolate cake with peanut bridle, roasted pear and whipped cream, all of it covered in chocolate sauce.  Not a single complaint about anything on the menu (she was too full to finish dessert so I picked up the slack).    You can really taste the freshness of the fruits and veggies they grow right on the farm and incorporate into the meals.  The service was excellent, though to be fair it was a little slow when we first arrived (I'm a little shocked more people haven't taken advantage of this place during the Restaurant Week discount).    All in all an outstanding first impression from my first trip here.  I plan to come back to try back the rest of the menu (though to be sure I will only go here for special occasions from now on).",

You can enjoy a multi-course tasting menu in a relaxing environment, as opposed to the stiff old-people vibe of other higher end restaurants.  The farm setting is quaint and refreshing - it's almost like stepping out of Phoenix and being on vacation for a brief spell.    As for the food, it won't satisfy your palate if you're used to the typical American cookie-cutter chain with overseasoned, cooked-from-frozen pap.  The food at Quiessence is seasonal, organic, locally sourced, and vibrant...perfect for a cosmopolitan palate.  They have a very specific philosophy in terms of how they do things.  The focus is on quality, which may lead to a slightly more leisurely pace than some are used to, but the wait is by no means long.  It's part of the experience - to spend time with someone whose company you enjoy and just relax in the lovely garden setting while eating wonderfully creative food.  I've had two tasting menus - one of them at the Brick Oven Table - and while the first was excellent, the second time was just sublime.  Apparently, they're opening in the afternoons now for more inexpensive and quicker lunch options.  The one area where I would have faulted Quiessence after my first visit was the dessert...it was good enough, but you could tell they needed a specialized pastry chef.  The second time, the dessert had noticeably improved and was up to snuff with the rest of the wonderful meal....we asked, and sure enough, a pastry chef had just joined the team.",

Sometimes you need more than just good atmoshphere and ok food . We ordered wine and the first two wines they were out of. It took over half an hour just to get a wine. From the time we sat down till we left it was 3 hrs, i understand casual dining but that is ridiculous. It was an hour just to get the first course, and the restaurant was half full. I thought the appetizers and salads were way over priced. We felt the over all price did not reflect the value of the meal. Most disturbing was the wait staff. For this extensive menu and wine list they were way too inexperienced and needed more training.",

It started with a bad table, moved to a better location, then waited for five minutes until our waitperson acknowledged us. After getting through the culinary feast introduction  which we declined, we ordered apps, dinner and a glass of wine. After an hour we still had not received our apps. When they did arrive they were excellent. The owner or manager acknowledged our long wait with a complimentary glass of wine for KJ.  After another painful wait we received our dinners. Mine being the seafood selection, my wife had a pasta speciality. The seafood was cooked perfect not quite as hot as it should have been, and KJ's pasta was hot & perfect. In closing an 18% gratuity was added to the bill which was not what this service was worth. Good restaurant , perhaps it was just a bad night? I would not however go back when there are restaurants like Kai and others that deserve your business.",

    "text": "Quiessence does it again . . . another fabulous experience for me and on a holiday, too!    My husband and I dined there last night for Valentine's Day.  It was just incredible! For starters, due to a mistaken turn down a dirt road earlier in the day, we were a half hour late. I used to work in the restaurant industry and know how tight the schedule is during holiday seating . . . well, they accommodated us without any issues or attitude.  Then we were seated at a table right in front of the fireplace - how romantic!!!  We decided to order separate dishes so that we could try more of the items on the special holiday menu. We also chose the wine pairing for an additional $35/person.  A few of our favorites for the night . . .  Lobster and Crab Salad . . . the aioli that was served with it was so yummy! And the seafood was prepared perfectly! Pairing with 2008 Ballentine Vineyards Chenin Blanc was brilliant!  Always love the housemade charcuterie!  The Braised Beef Cannelloni with Melting Fiscalini Cheddar Cheese was the winner for the night. My husband actually wanted to order a second one because he just couldn't get enough. Sous Chef Tony does an amazing job with the homemade pasta at Quiessence.  Our favorite wine of the night was Arizona Stronghold Nachise and 2006 Gundlach Bundschu Pinot Noir.  OK, and dessert was phenomenal. We both ordered chocolate which I normally don't do . . . and the Flourless Chocolate Torte with (housemade) Marshmallow, Hazelnut Cream and Fudge Sauce was to die for! I didn't want to share this one.  Overall, I have to say that I'm always impressed by the freshness of the food, the inspired preparation and the commitment to local flavors.  Chef LaPrad gets my vote as one of the top chefs I've run across. I'm never disappointed and always pleasantly surprised that each visit builds on the last, just getting better and better.  Lastly, the service is always impeccable and friendly. I've always been greeted warmly.  The servers are very knowledgeable and passionate.  I also love that I see the same faces visit after visit.  I wouldn't say that service is fast; but with that being said, I wouldn't want it fast.  This is a beautiful place and I want to savor every minute. I love to relax between courses, sipping my wine and letting each course digest.    So, whether you're looking for the perfect romantic meal or a place to impress a business client, Quiessence will not disappoint. I will continue to return again and again with confidence that each visit will be as incredible as the last.",

    "text": "So what happened to Quiessence?  I've been to this restaurant many times and thought it to be one of the very best places in the Valley.  I've often had 5 star meals here and never less than a 4 star night, until this past Friday.   What happened to the fantastic vegetable side dishes? What happened to entrees that were actually cooked? When did the prices nearly double? What in the world is an 18% house service fee?  To start, we ordered the vegetable crudite plate.  In the past, this consisted of various farm fresh raw vegetables with several dipping sauces.  This go 'round the plate was a melange of various vegetable presentations, from grilled squash, pickled vegetables, and cheese to a fantastic terrine plated next to goat cheese-stuffed squash blossoms.  While I miss the simplicity of the raw vegetable plate, this new take on the crudite was a success and the highlight of the entire meal.   Our next course was the inventive octopus sopprasotta with candied red peppers and pickled veggies.  The octopus was extremely tender and was uniquely paired with the garnishes.  On its own, the candied red pepper was far too sweet, but combined with the pickled onions, cucumber, and a bite of the thinly slice octopus, the dish was balanced and flavorful.    As for the entree courses, this is when the disappointment truly sets in.  I ordered the pan seared black cod in a roasted onion cream and my dining companion ordered the Mangalista Pork Loin, a unique type of pork known for its heavy marbling and thick cap of buttery fat.   In both cases, the proteins were dramatically undercooked.  For me, cod is a fish that should be cooked to medium doneness.  You want to make sure that it is heated all the way through, though still light and moist.  The cod I received was so rare, it had no texture at all.  It nearly disintegrated in my mouth.  Had it been raw it may have had more texture.  In this case, it was mushy.  I was so put off by the strange consistency  I could not finish my dish, though the onion cream it came with was delectable.  As for my partner, his fatty pork was also so rare I had difficulty eating it.  It was a soft pork with a odd \"beefy\" flavor that also picked up the subtle earthy notes from the mushrooms it was prepared with.  Not for my palate.  I missed the actual flavor of pork in this dish and was again put off by the weird texture. As for my  partner, while he was somewhat more comfortable with the level of doneness, he was very disappointed at the inedible hunk of connective tissue in the center that could not be cut with a steak knife.  Both entrees were unfortunate.  Had the meat been a better cut and both dishes actually cooked, they may have worked.   I was also tremendously sad, there were no longer any side dishes offered on the menu.  In the past, one of the very best features of Quiessence was the broad offering of simply prepared, farm fresh, ripe vegetables.  Too often, fine dining restaurants offer vegetables as an afterthought... just a garnish or a shmeer of puree on the plate.  Quiessence was one of the few places were their \"grown on site\" vegetables were a feature to be enjoyed at the peak of freshness.  We were so hoping for a side of roasted butternut squash or another featured fall vegetable.  Outside of the crudite plate and the two salad options, there were no veggie choices to be had.   To end the meal, we did enjoy the Honeycrisp Apple Tart with homemade vanilla ice cream.  It was a delight.  The apples flavorful, the granola topping crunchy and sweet, the ice cream rich and creamy.   As we looked at the bill noticing how much more expensive Quiessence had become, my companion and I reflected on the starts and stops of the night.  We discussed whether or not the crudite plate was worth $26 (it was) and if the \"designer\" pork was worth $42 (most definitely not),  then we see a charge we had never before seen, an 18% house service fee.  When I asked the server if this was for her tip, she responds with \"Oh, this is the house service fee.\"  What does that mean?  Has Quiessence now affiliated themselves with Ticketmaster?  I am not used to random, unexplained fees on my restaurant bill.  This strange charge clenched it for me.  Quiessence is no longer the place I once loved.",

    "text": "I love this restaurant.  If you consider yourself a gourmand, one who seeks the best in life, one who searches for innovative cuisine, or just a lover of real food, you will appreciate Quiessence.  Check out their website (or call) to get a sense of the menu.  They make a magical Valentine's Day dinner (and will do it on the 13th, if you like the idea but not the extreme madness in going out for that evening).  I kept my menu and will stare at it longingly forever.  We did the wine pairing with each course, mmmmmm.  I just don't have the time and money at this point in my life to do that kind of work, so taking advantage of someone else's tastes (as long as they are excellent) is a beautiful thing to me.    Fresh ingredients - local ones where possible - and damn good ones.  Wonderful wait staff, with whom to discuss your gastronomic experience.  Setting: lovely South Mountain farm with pecan trees, which includes Maya's Farm (produce are sold at the Downtown Public Market on Saturdays) and a brunch and lunch restaurant (all 3 are in separate areas/buildings).    Quiessence is pricey but definitely worth it.  Take someone who will appreciate it.  Update, 9 September 2007: We went here for our anniversary dinner...mmm.  Just as awesome as ever.  I felt compelled to add a few things so people wouldn't be shocked when going there: - Portion sizes are fairly small, so that you can choose one of each course.  I'm sure that makes the prices (which you can find on the website under the menu) all the more shocking to some people.  To me, it's totally worth it. - This restaurant is a good way to impress other people.  Maybe your taste buds are poor, but you are rich - you should still take people here :)   - Staff tip: amazing pears from Aravaipa Farms, which has a bed & breakfast, only about 2.5 hrs drive from Phoenix (on the way to Globe) but with a different microclimate, <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aravaipafarms.com%2F&s=2cf6a81a8b6d0b81d4ce8cf6805fcb91ead2b5c4089364227ba39b802e683a56\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">aravaipafarms.com</a>  Update, May 2008:  we went again for a celebratory dinner and got the brick oven table.  I'm still so thrilled this place exists and that I can support it when my budget allows.  The brick oven table with the wine pairings is a spendy (nearly $400 for the 2 of us) but worthwhile experience.  The menu for the evening is personalized to your tastes.  In the last year, we found out one of us has a wheat allergy, and one of us has a corn allergy.  Those were some new things to accommodate, and we mentioned that when making reservations expecting it to be accommodated.  We had 8 courses and 9 glasses of wine each, over the course of 5.5 hours.  There was ample time to rest and relax in between courses, and we were stuffed when we left (but  not unpleasantly so).  You're really in your own little private world at the brick oven table...far enough from the noises of other diners to enhance your experience.  Dustin was our server for the evening, and we enjoyed all the info he shared about the ingredients in the food and the wines.  Some of the wine pairings were extraordinary with the food.  Some were surprising (one that tasted like its Spanish coastal terroir, served with shellfish).  There were a few things that disappointed me, though.  Our allergies were forgotten a few times, though when that happened, replacement food was brought out promptly.  For the most part, our allergies were attended to well.  However, dessert sort of ruined things.  We were initially brought a selection of lovely cake-like and crust-laden desserts.  I mentioned the wheat.  They were replaced with two citrus sorbets, one grapefruit, one lemon, and lemon creme brulees.  This was served with tawny port.  No no no!  All that sour citrus...and port??  I let them know that didn't work at all.  Surely something could have been made - a flourless chocolate cake, perhaps?  The lemon creme brulee on its own would have been fine, but with all of that mouth-puckering sorbet...I still love the place, I'm still glad it exists, the service is superior, and I love the use of wonderful-tasting, fresh, local ingredients, but that dessert didn't work.  Thank goodness for the other 7 courses (including a whole fish we picked clean...in addition to our meat course).  In spite of the poor dessert choices this time around, I'm convinced that people who think their food is \"overpriced\" or \"overrated\" have poor palates and probably rarely venture outside of chain restaurants, where the food is laden with corn syrup, MSG, and other fake flavors.  Every main course I've had there was outstanding.",

I knew that it existed, and I had read that it was good, but I had no idea what we were in for.  We got the 6 course Farmers Feast with wine pairings ($75/person + $45/person for wine), and i would recommend it to anyone.  Our server brought each of us different plates for each course with different wine pairings.  So if you are willing to share, each diner really gets to try 12 different plates and 12 different wines.  Each and every course was fantastic, but our favorite was the grilled Mexican sea bass and the hand cut tagliatalle with wild mushrooms and wild ramps.  I could go back the very next day and order just that pasta, but the menu changes daily.  Some suggestions - book early and spurge for the outdoor fireplace table.  I wanted this, but it was already booked.  If you cant get that table, request to be outside or on the patio.  The ambiance here is really fantastic and totally unique.  Being seated inside is nice, but you do miss out on a bit of the experience.  This place is right up there with Kai, and I would assume Binkley's, although I have yet to go.",

It was unfortunately cold and rainy when we went in May, so we sat inside; a great treat was the local blues guitarist who was playing that night. However, the food was the real treat. We ordered the cheese and cured meat plate to start; the cheese was good, but I would skip the cured meats, which were some head cheeses and kind of weird other gross-ish meats (even my boyfriend who is into cured meats would tell you to pass). Everything else we ordered was superb; a house-made ravioli, a scallop special with peaches and greens, and especially the vegetables of the day, 2 dishes where the chef prepares seasonal vegetables to fit his mood. We also had dessert, a peach cobbler that was delicious. The waiter was knowledgeable and all his suggestions were right on the money. Yes, the prices are higher than you  might expect, but the flavor you get out of fresher local ingredients is worth it. This is where I'll be taking my parents when they next come to town.",

It was tucked away in rural evening simplicity. My second exposure was a quiet dinner for two, and it was extraordinary. Our server, Nicole, was exemplary: timely but not pushy, informative but not excessive. She kept our drinks coming in a nice rhythm and explained the subtle nuances of each dish. Most importantly, she called after we left . . . why, you ask? Because I failed to notice the \"gratuity included\" note on the bill and added a sizable tip to the total. She wanted to ensure I was aware. I told her to keep it, as she made our night. The cheese selection, especially with the fresh honeycomb, was outstanding. It started us off on the perfect note, and that lovely culinary song continued into fresh, locally-grown salads (mine with seared scallops) and perfectly prepared entrees. Dessert? We had to try it . . . an authentic, hug your southern grandma, bread pudding. My companion for the evening, in his words, \"was blown away\" by the experience. The walk back to the car, on a crisp evening (btw), makes for a great chance to walk closely. Coy smile.",

My husband and I were blown away with the service from start to finish - even during an electrical outage in the neighborhood in June! They took care of us with extra waters and the service didn't slow down. We chose the Farmer's Feast for the evening and sampled 10 menu items in total this way - simply amazing! My favs? Do I have to pick? I guess I would say the light and luscious cheese gnocchi and its companion pasta: hand cut tagliatelle. But honestly - all of it was so good. One thing for those of us who are weekday vegetarians, I wouldn't bother breaking that code for the house cured meats. For me, it was the least exciting. Save your honor.

Where to start on what went wrong...the server had zero personality and verged on rude, the salad was inedible (how can a salad be inedible?), entries took forever to come out and when they did there was nothing to it.  I ordered a baked chicken dish that was so not impressive.  Our side order of greens was overcooked and saturated in oil. And they only serve coffee by the pot not by the glass... who does that?   And to add insult to injury we had an enormous bill!  The upside... The bread was good.  Maybe they were having an off night or training a new chief but I would be reluctant to go back to this restaurant.",

    "text": "We ate Thanksgiving dinner at the Q. It was our very first time there so we didn't quite know what to expect.  We had heard and read all sorts of rave reviews of the place, but I have to say I was a little surprised by the very rustic surroundings, especially the non-paved parking lot.  We chose the 5 p.m. seating. We were greeted very warmly and seated promptly. Unfortunately, our table was close to the bathroom. If we go back, which we will, I would request a different table.   We were served with complimentary foccacia bread and carrot bread. The foccacia was good, but the carrot bread was phenomenal. Both were served warm with herb butter.  We then ordered a bottle of Cliff Lede sauvignon blanc that we thought was very good.  After that, we placed our order. I had the Foraged Mushroom and Chestnut soup. It was excellent, but very rich and filling. My husband and daughter each had a beet and apple salad with cheddar and spring mix. They both thought it was excellent. The salad had both red and golden beets in it.  My husband and I both ordered the Turkey entree and our daughter ordered a risotto. The turkey was outstanding! Two huge thick slices coated with a little gravy and cranberry sauce. We actually would have liked more gravy and cranberry sauce. The accompaniments were mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, candied yams and cornbread stuffing. I was actually a bit disappointed with the accompanying dishes. I don't eat candied yams so didn't have any. The creamed spinach had a very runny consistency but was good. The mashed potatoes were good but didn't make much of a statement. The cornbread stuffing had a very mild flavor about it and I couldn't really taste it that much. I actually thought a better accompaniment would have been some roasted brussel sprouts. Just my opinion. Again, more cranberry sauce would have been appreciated and more gravy. That way we could have put some of the gravy on the potatoes.  Dessert was pumpkin pie or apple crisp. Our daughter ordered the pumpkin pie. She thought it was good but not memorable. My husband and I each ordered the apple crisp. It was so rich, I couldn't eat mine. Also, I couldn't discern hardly any apples in it.   SO, the star of the meal was the turkey!  The meal was pricey at $59 per head (not to mention the bottle of wine). Also, we were taken aback that an 18% gratuity was automatically added to the bill. We generally leave a 20% gratuity which we would have done in this instance.  Nonetheless, it was a very memorable dining experience and we would definitely go back.",

    "text": "We visited Quiessence for the first time last Saturday evening.  We had a nice table in the front room with many windows looking out on to the natural farm setting.  The service was sluggish all night long.  Not only did it take too long to get pretty much anything, but our server literally disappeared in between infrequent visits to the table.  He tried to explain that their margaritas had a lot of ginger in them, and peppers also.  He did check back to see how I liked it.  When I told him it tasted like ginger ale, he assured me it was a lot more sophisticated than that.  The scallop, cauliflower and arrugula salad was outstanding.  In fact, I would say that their produce is to die for.  Absolutely exquisite, including the apples in my pork shoulder dish.  My husband had a seafood cream soup that was also very good.  My pork shoulder was good, not anything to get up in the night and shout about.  The sweet potato mash was very nice.  Hubby had fried duck with a gigantic duck egg on the plate.  Portion wasn't very big but there was a rutabaga mash under the duck that tasted fresh and delicious.  We shared a devil's food cake that the waiter mooned over when I announced our decision but it was overly cold and seemed quite stale.  I asked to have my remaining pork shoulder bagged to go, about half the original portion, and he took it away saying that he would return it to the table with the check.  He did not and I didn't notice until I got home and I wasn't happy.  Wrote an email to someone off their site and he wrote back the next day and said he was sorry and would send a gift certificate.  The biggest shock of the evening came when the server informed us that all tickets carried an obligatory 18% gratuity.  This place is pricey, folks.  But I think maybe it is primarily known as a special occasion experience and I guess they think maybe the clientele can't be trusted to know what is a good tip.  In fact, they ask you when you first arrive if it is a special occasion.  All in all, a disappointment.  The price of a really fine restaurant that doesn't actually live up to it.",

I mean you really can't get much more farm to table than Quiessence because your literally on a farm! The ambiance is beautiful, making it a perfect spot for a romantic meal. The part that bummed me out was the food was delicious but not out of this world amazing. I enjoyed the Kobocha Squash Soup which was served with an apple relish, tessa, goat cheese mouse and fried rosemary it was velvety and delicious but didn't WOW me. Next up was the Hamachi Crudo, that was the real star of the evening. It was fresh and flavorful! For my entree I had the Dayboat Alaskan Halibut, it had a great crust but my fish was overcooked and kind of dry and there wasn't much flavor development with the veggies and sauce that it was served with. Presentation of the food was beautiful, it was almost too beautiful to eat. I just wished that there was as much effort into flavor as presentation. Our server was wonderful, couldn't have asked for better service! Maybe I came on an off night, so I am going to have to come back!",

    "text": "I was looking for a really special restaurant near Tempe to take our recent college-grad to celebrate the occasion.    I found this restaurant when I searched for the $$$$ price range (yes on purpose... I have learned that searching for a 4 or 5 star restaurant in the Phoenix area results in lots of mediocre cheap food.  I think cheap is the driving factor in college students' ratings, so my theory is that Yelp ratings in this region are more about what's cheap than what's actually good.)  Even with the $$$$ price range, Quiessence Restaurant & Wine Bar appeared #2 after Domino's Pizza.  What a crazy region!  Anyway, these words jumped out, and were the reason we went:  \"Historic home\" \"warm country feel\" \"local, sustainable\"... well, I was SOLD.  The reviews that pick apart things about the food are a little intense in my opinion... my feeling is the food is wonderful, the relaxed farm atmosphere would keep us going back, and those kinds of comments by professional-sounding reviewers would be better said in a private email or note to the restaurant.  Tip:  When you're on S. 32nd Street, look for the sign that says \"The Farm at South Mountain,\" and drive through the twinkly lights towards the back of the property.  This restaurant really pleased us, and if we lived in the area, I know it would become a regular favorite.  We let the chef decide our dinners by selecting the Seasonal Tasting Menu.  One of our servers also recommended to us that we should definitely try the pastas next time we dine.  Our main server knew every detail about each dish he set in front of us, which amazed us because we were presented with many many different things and unique ingredients... my favorite ingredient-name was called \"fiddlehead fern.\"  :)  Feeling blessed to be able to treat our daughter to such a nice experience.",

    "text": "I'm really not sure where to start everything was so wonderful. We had the Taste of Quiessence and it was three courses of complex flavor built around simple local farm veggies and wines. The first course was smoked trout on a baguette with whipped herb creme fresh, dill, crisp capers, and red onion. It was so good I didn't get a picture before it was gone. The second course was a salad so fresh and complex I won't be able to adequately describe how delicious it was. The salad had a garlic puree, tempura oakra, poached tomatoes, zucchini puree, cucumbers, green beans, a tapenade, and at least one other flavor I'm forgetting. The main course was a chicken cutlet on a bed of couscous in a red sauce with poached tomatoes, creme fresh and lemon zest. Dessert was a delightful bread pudding with vanilla ice cream and a panna cotta with fruit and a sorbet. The wine pairings were interesting but not amazing. The service we received from Robert was top notch, he is so knowledgeable it really added to the experience. Overall it was a super fun experience and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for an organic fresh local sustainable choice.",

The beautiful outdoor dining experience with light music was breathtaking and so quiet and peaceful. Coming from a home with 3 young kids, this was the perfect place for us. Upon arrival the bottle of champagne i ordered was already at the table as requested. The staff was amazing! I was in the service industry my whole life and this was above my expectations. Not only our server but the bussers and food runners were amazing! Now the food....there are no words. I am the picky eater in my house, and every single food item was like heaven in my mouth! The fresh ingredients were the best part. I have never had so much flavor in one bite. Also the bread pudding was the best dessert i have had!! Thank you for such a wonderful experience... we will definitely be back! I think Katlyn was our server. She was awesome!!",

    "text": "Overall a very nice experience, with a couple of missteps.   I was treated by my fiancee to the Brick Oven Dinner to celebrate my birthday. The location is great. Close enough to the freeway to make it an easy trip from downtown Phoenix, but definitely in the country.  Blink and you might miss the sign to the farm, but follow the track to the very end and you will find many choices. Quiessence is one of the choices (on the left)  The table for the Brick Oven Dinner is very cute. Set apart from the rest of the tables under a canopy and of course the oven, with heaters on either side, which we needed later on. You really feel like a VIP sitting there.  Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu, but at times a little robotic. Another server who would pop by from time to time was a little more authentic. She engaged in conversation with us and added more logs to the fire where needed.  The meal got off to a bit of a rocky start when she got my drink wrong. I ordered a Gibson, she brought a Gimlet. No big deal, she'll switch it out. But then she comes back and says she doesn't have any cocktail onions, so I settle for a regular martini instead.  The premise of the Brick Oven menu is that it's Chef's Choice. He'll work around your allergies, restrictions and preferences to create a customized menu just for you. Sounds great! One vegetarian, one meat eater, no allergies please!  I realized while researching the writing of this review that what I received was almost exactly the same as Yelper Dave G. received. So I will defer to his review for most of the descriptions (plus photos for every course).  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/quiessence-restaurant-phoenix?hrid=FhTlYlSYw_vQPUWBHO0tnA\">yelp.com/biz/quiessence-...</a>  Here's what we got -   Amuse Bouche - little shooter of chilled apple soup. mine had an oyster, her's didn't.  1. Charcuterie & Cheese. Nicely separated with the meat on my side and the cheese on hers. This course took FOREVER to come out. We would have been there for 8 hours if the pacing for each subsequent course had been the same as this one  2. Parsnip Soup - mine had bacon, her's didn't  3. Beet Salad & Seasonal Vegetables  4. I received the Wagyu Capaccio. This was my favourite dish of the night. She received the himachi crudo minus the himachi. The server said this dish was her favourite, but she had never seen it without the fish. Looked a little sad  5. Potato Gnocchi. Mine came with hen, her's didn't. Light and excellent. Highly recommend  6. For the entree I received chicken scallopini. I was a little disappointed with this course. Reading Rob's review (which had been identical up until this point) this was a letdown. She got a plate of vegetables.  7 & 8 - Not sure if they were getting tired of us, or if they wanted to go home, but courses 7 and 8 came at the same time. Panna Cotta with a blackberry soup; apple marscapone cannoli (excellent!) and dulce de leche bread pudding (very good)  We ordered coffees, one regular and one decaf and they were both cold. As we were literally the last people in the joint, we didn't ask for a replacement, plus she had already dropped the check right after the desserts, so the message was clear.  So, overall a 4-star experience. For the most part excellent food although I felt they took some lazy short cuts with the vegetarian options and I really don't know why the charcuterie board took close to an hour to arrive! Service was mostly good, although I felt rushed at the end which shouldn't be the case when you are paying $120 per head plus drinks.",

    "text": "Our third time to Quiessence and first since a change in Executive Chefs. This place has always had a fairly high standard for cuisine and presentation and we were pleasantly surprised the quality has not wavered. That being said, bear in mind Quiessence is quite pricey, particularly when you opt for the Chef's tasting menu and pair wine with your meal. But we knew that going in and if you're in for the whole culinary experience, you won't be disappointed.  Renee, our server, greeted us and thoroughly explained the menu options. We opted for the tasting menu and wine pairing for the evening. The couses were as follows: 1. Charcuterie board - a delicious spread of tasty nougats including figs, beautifully prepared beets, duck liver pate, pickled watermelon rind and a half dozen other delicious items.  2. Her: Maya's Foraged Garden - an excellent plate of fresh veggies from, well, Maya's garden. Me: Foie Gras - Wow.  3. Pistachio soup - Quite tasty, I especially liked how the sweetness of the pistachio and tart goat cheese blended with a sweet/savory combo. However, it could have been the lighting but the color of the soup could have been more appetizing.  4. Crispy Potato Gnocchi - I'm a lover of Gnocchi, period. But how many ways can you make it? Well, we learned about one more. This dish was terrific.  5. Main Course - Her: Dayboat Diver Scallops - Very well prepared and perfectly cooked. Me: Aged NY Strip - tasty and perfectly cooked to Medium Rare with very nice squash & baby bok choy.  Dessert - Sweet Polenta cake with persimmons and the house bread pudding. Both well made, but we were stuffed by then. Should have had it first.  The only area in which I think the restaurant could improve would be their wine list and pairings. None of the wine pairings really blew us away. They were all good, just not great. However, they definitely have the cuisine down, so the wine pairing should be remedied with a little tinkering.  All in all, a great dining experience. We'll go back, again.",

I understand they staff and prep food with the expectation they'll have a certain number of diners, but a $25 fee is ridiculous and that number is not stated in their policy. Really? You need to charge $25 on a $75 meal? A slow night or overstock is part of the risk of running a business, restaurants around the world are able to manage that risk, however Quiessence instead puts all of that risk on the customer. I decided to eat here because I thought the outdoor ambiance would be charming for a date night, I wish I had read the negative reviews about the poor service and uninspiring food as I would have thought twice about making a reservation.",

From the charcuterie board that included everything you could imagine from aged white cheddar, two different forms of goat cheese, chicken liver mousse, different berry preserves and much more that ended up in me and my girlfriend's stomach. Although our ticket was lost in the busy shuffle of the night, the manager Mike was more than helpful and made us feel welcome the rest of the night. The next courses continued to get even better from the first and our waiter made some great choices for the wine pairings with the rest of the courses. My favorite dish had to be the hen and my girlfriend really loved her cannoli at the end of the night. Overall it was a romantic evening with good food. When we are back in Phoenix, they will have our business every time.",

    "text": "Disappointing. Party of five to celebrate my mother's birthday. we chose the tasting menu. We were prepared to take our time and enjoy our evening, but after two hours we had only been served our second of five courses. We let our server know of our concern and she promised to expedite things. Another twenty minutes and we finally received course number three - at least an hour between courses.  It would have been tolerable if the food was excellent and if the service was impeccable. No such luck. How many times must the service staff need to be told that we would prefer to finish the food on our plate before it is taken away from us?  And the food quality fell far short of what one expects of a restaurant at this price point.   At the conclusion of the meal, there was no acknowledgment by the chef or by management of the poor service. We have eaten in fine restaurants throughout the world and have enjoyed tasting menus at many Michelin-starred establishments. The only way in which Quiessence could be compared to one of those is in the price.",

    "text": "I have been to Quiessence pre and post Chef Dustin Christofolo taking over as chef and have been very impressed with the new look of the inside and outside of the property as well as the new menu items that I have been seeing. I came with a group and we reserved the Private Dining Room in the middle of the restaurant. I love sitting in this area when not there for a date night. Date nights, I prefer The Brick Oven Table.   Anyways, we started the meal with The Artisan Bread and Fromage Board. It is a beautifully arranged board with chutneys and local cheeses. We also tried the Chickpea and beet fritters. I loved the garlic aiolo on the plate.   There was a Sweet Potato Soup on the menu that I had to try, and glad that I did. Smoked Bacon, Apple Relish, Goat Cheese and then they delicately poured the soup around in front of you at the table.   I have heard Chef Christofolo is known for his hand made pastas, so had to try a dish. The Pork Belly Cappaletti was so tender and the sauce was divine.   My entree of choice was the Pork Chop. Massive in size, I was worried I wouldn't finish. The squash puree underneath complimented the dish well, and I loved the addition of pistachios on top.   We finished the meal with a few desserts. The chocolate walnut pie is a MUST if it's still on the menu when you go. We also had the seasonal sorbet. Ours was made with kumquats, an interesting fruit to try. Both were delicious.   Overall, I would say Quiessence was an A+ in my book of Arizona fine dining. The service was spot on and the atmosphere was great. I would definitely go back for a date night or with friends again.",

When we met the hostess her words exactly were \"it will be a little while\"......?  A little while turned into sitting down at 9:15pm to eat.   I never thought we had over a hour wait.   They did offer a small glass of champagne to ease the wait.   I do think they should have done a lot more considering the wait and the length of time between each meal.   We didn't leave to after 1130.   Total bummer.",

    "text": "Recently transplanting here from Northern California, where farms and organic produce are everywhere, I got excited about going to a restaurant here in Phoenix that has its own organic farm and within the city to boot. At first, I thought I was going to have to drive beyond the city but, no, happily it's not far from downtown.  We got there about 5:30pm and got a little tour of the property first, and it's quaint, rustic, and very welcoming, so of course it is a place after my own heart. I could hang out in the courtyards with a cool glass of lemonade, some of their fresh baked breads, and a good book, all afternoon.  There was three of us and we ordered the Farmer's Feast which is basically a cornucopia of dishes the chef creates. For each of the six courses, each of us got our own dish, so we could sample and try each others. So yeah, if you do some math, that is 18 different dishes total. The awesome thing though is that each plate is small and I did not feel like I had to be rolled out of there.  Since there are way too many dishes to talk about, on my food blog you can see almost all the food we ate. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2Fdy0AFX&s=76ed50a5efe95d83be2e2bd28f237b9916d7e49504736d0e9d02636239b15a7f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/dy0AFX</a>   The fennel lemon bread was absolutely divine. They bake all the breads in this huge oven outside and so I must come back when they are baking.  I would have given this place 5 stars but all three of the meat dishes we got were meh. In fact, the lamb chops I got were way too on the bloody side. But hey, they got 5 out of 6 courses on the money so that's pretty awesome.  Quiessence is a great place to take your sweetie for a charming evening, friends or family who are into organics and supporting local producers, and parents or the elders visiting from out of town.",

    "text": "One of the rare times Yelp reviews completely mislead us! Key reasons for this EPIC FAIL for Valentine's Dinner. 1. Food was not worth the price. 2. Server failed to disclose the very expensive price of a bottle of wine that was not listed on the menu 3. Service was slow 4. Ambiance was unusual  My husband and I went to Quiessence for Valentine's on Thursday the 13th and ordered the prefix menu for $80 per person. I waited at the table by myself for the first hour because my husband was coming straight from the airport and his flight was unexpectedly delayed. I didn't mind this at all especially because I could catch up on some emails while enjoying some much needed wine and quiet time (3 babies at home - don't get out much=). I asked the server a few questions about what she recommended for sweet wines and she suggested a bottle that was normally a special and not listed on the menu. I liked it a lot and the manager approved the sale however she did not tell me the price. I didn't ask because of all the sweet wines we were considering the most expensive one was about $48/bottle. I wouldn't assume that the bottle I got would be much more and if so, the server would tell me. Um no! It was $77!!!!! I was so frustrated and over this place when I got the bill, I just paid it and left as soon as I could.   Regarding the food; it was a 4 course meal, all of which was mediocre. The appetizer of prosciutto and brie was good but small and must of had a food cost of cents! The soup and salad was the same level of quality (squash soup and kale salad). Nothing special. The pork shank entree was the best part of the meal but not worth $80 to have 1 good dish of 7. The salmon was small and bland. Again nothing to write home about. The dessert was a variety of different sweets, all of which were frozen. Talk about mass produced and definitely not made to order. We also didn't get the bread until after our soup/salad which we must of asked for 3 times. (Sidenote: it would of been nice of her to also offer bread while I was waiting for my husband).  With a bill of $310 I wish we would of stuck to our normal ruth's chris or capital grille. Never ever will I go to Quiessence again or recommend it. This is sad to me because my husband and I work in an industry where we host high profile clients for lunch and dinner on a daily basis and finding gems in Phoenix is rare.   Regarding ambiance; I used to live in Japan and it reminded me a lot of old alley restaurants you find there where people turn old houses into restaurants. We were sitting on a patio in the corner with an old school window AC unit and dirt backyard. So weird and definitely not romantic.",

    "text": "It was my first time here and I brought some friends. I was really excited about the meal since I've always heard great things about it and thought this would be a great time to try it out during Restaurant Week but that excitement fell by the wayside as the night progressed.  Well, the food was \"ok\". Despite my friend's duck being a bit on the dry side and the soup being served in bowls that were too wide which made them cool off faster than they could be eaten, it was decent.  The ambiance is pleasant and definitely romantic.    Service wise... definitely left room for improvement.  1) Some of our dishes were taken while we were still eating. 2) On more than one occasion we had to ask for more water. 3) When announcing the food the waiters were presenting, some forgot the descriptions. Not a super big deal but if you're going to open your mouth to announce what is in the dish, shouldn't you remember what is in it? 4) There was a 30 minute wait between the appetizer and the first course 5) The servers chimed into our party's conversation unexpectedly. This is something I'd expect of Dennys, not Quiessence.  If you go here for dinner, bring a flashlight for the parking lot and the walk through the courtyard to the restaurant.  An older couple I saw leaving almost couldn't find their way through the courtyard and I was a bit worried one of them might fall.  Considering the rough terrain, you'd think they'd light up the pathway a bit more.",

    "text": "This was my first and LAST visit to Quiessence (6-Aug).   1) The power (& AC) shut off several times (approx 8), yet management did nothing to compensate other than an apology after the 1st outage.   2) The $12/$15 PER PERSON price of the 'Chefs Spread APPETIZER' was far too high for the minimal amount of food provided. It took over 20 minutes to arrive ... yet nothing had to be cooked (??).   3) The entrees took over 30 minutes to arrive.   4) In when the bill arrived, they added an automatic 18% gratuity .. for TWO PEOPLE? I've discovered that this standard operating procedure! This is wrong and defeats the purpose of the gratuities. The server have no incentive to provide good service (as was apparent from our long waits). The fact that the gratuity was also charged on the bottle of wine (more on that later) ... deplorable.  5) When I look at the bill, I saw the wrong bottle (and a pricier one) was charged to my bill. We had to ask another staff member to get our waitress (who seemed to have forgotten us). She did take change the bottle, but should this have been necessary at the prices charged by Quiessence?  6) Yes, I know Quiessence is on a working farm. So, they should reduce their prices to reflect their setting (and poor electrical service). This should include better lighting for the path from the restaurant to the parking area  I am severely disappointed with my dining experience at Quiessence. I had been looking forward to dining there for years. The overpriced appetizers, poor service, non-apologetic management, and the 'slap in your face' automatic 18% gratuity makes me wonder how Quiessence could survive ... especially in this economy. Other similarly-prices restaurants would simply not allow these issues to exist.",

    "text": "Unlike my last review, this 3 star grade is a real disappointment.  Listen, I love the Farm at South Mountain Concept, it is beautifully laid out, lush and green, quiet and cool. It looks like a perfect spot for a wedding or a first date picnic. I've been to a gardening class over at Maya's Farm, breakfasts and brunches at Morning Glory Cafe, and this most recent visit for dinner to Quiessence.   Two years ago at West of Western I had some amazing sample from Quiessence that has stuck in my mind ever since. Well, clearly the actual food item didn't stick in my mind, but the deliciousness factor made me memorize the name Quiessence. For one of my last big dinners before leaving Phoenix I wanted to finally get there and relive the delicious experience. Certainly I can get behind the concept of local and season foods, sustainable foods, and daily changing menus. I did notice that the menu did not change from Thursday when I looked it up online to Friday when we dined there, but I'm guessing that's typical in the summers. Perhaps they should leave that daily-changing bit out of their advertising.   I arrived a little early, as did one of my companions, so we ordered cocktails (Maiden's Prayer and a Manhattan) while we waited. For $12 each I was a little surprised that my cocktail glass was only just over half full. Really. When the rest of the party arrived, a friend and I shared the crab and zucchini salad, which was GORGEOUS, and the server had the order split onto two plates for us without asking. My friend thought it was over-dressed, but I thought the fresh cool flavors and vinaigrette bite were perfect.   The protein courses were not really impressive, I have to admit. I chose the salmon (no provenance identified, strangely) which came with fiddlehead ferns and warm cucumbers.  This dish cost $37 and came with approximately 6 ounces of salmon, 4 fiddleheads and a bit of cucumber.  The hit of the night, which was a lukewarm hit to be sure, was hand cut pasta with thick chunks of mushrooms in a light creamy cheese sauce. I thought the flavors were well-balanced and the portion for $24 was significantly more than my dish. My friend said it wasn't the best homemade pasta she'd ever had.   All in all, my portion of the bill was $80 including tax and tip. My meal was not worth it, though the scenery and experience was lovely.  It sounds like the Farmer's Feast is a good bet and I would have chosen that, given a do over.",

The Himalayan salt block dishes were the coolest! My favorite dish out of all 8 courses was a tie between the appetizer plate that had all kinds of fun cheeses, olives, meats and fruits on it and the other equally favorite dish was the salt block with a sushi type dish on it! But all of it was amazing!!",

As we drove onto the Farm grounds we noticed a wedding reception off to the left in one of the grassy picnic areas.  Poor guy, you don't have to get married to have a great meal here!  We started with the chef's spread cured meat and salumi plate.  Each creation was very different and very good.  My pork loin dish was wonderful and my girlfriend's scallops were melt in her mouth good.  All the food here is so fresh and natural that the True flavors really come through in every bite.  The service and scenic grounds are delightful.  Even if you don't live nearby, this place is worth the trip for a very special dining experience.",

So for everyone who thinks the servers have no incentive, they do more than ever. The only way they make more than their flat rate is when someone goes over and above the 18%. I feel sorry for those who work there for this reason. The knowledge they have to have and the professionalism they have to present at every minute should be rewarded in reflection of their actual performance.   A cocktail waitress at a hole in the wall bar makes more than these guys do on any given night.",

I get that...they were all having fun. We asked to move to a table outside, but was told that they were all reserved.  This wasn't a very big place, but the outside area was very pretty and was lit by candlelight.   We sat for maybe 5 min and the hostess came back and gave us a wine list and then....nothing. We waited and waited, hostess came back again and asked if we had questions about the wine list. I said I did, and she said she would try to answer but didn't know much about wine. Hmmmm, ok. Still no server. At that point, we then decided to leave.    Very disappointed for a couple of reasons... 1. I would not think it would be so difficult to be acknowledged by a server, after all, they are there to take care of our dining accomadations. 2. We were on vacation and this place was very out of the way.  We waisted part of our evening and when vacationing that is the last thing I want to do. 3.  Hostess never said...\"Is there a problem?\"  She saw us leave, we walked right past her.",

    "text": "We dined at Q for restaurant week on Saturday and really enjoyed our experience. I had never had a fine dining experience beforehand, but this place showed me just how enjoyable such an evening can be.  Our server, Trisha, was great. She knew the wine list well and made excellent recommendations. Although we didn't like the first two wines she brought us, she found a gem for the final try and we were impressed with her knowledge and fluidity in handling our preferences.  The service was prompt without being overly fast, we had time to enjoy conversation and the courses we ate. I had the Dungeness crab-cucumber salad for the first course and the salmon for the second, and both were great. The onions on the salad could have been more flavorful, especially for being freshly shaved, but otherwise, I had no complaints about the salad. The entire salmon dish was incredible; I had never had huckleberries or lobster mushrooms and the pairing on the plate was great. The plating itself was beautiful and well thought out and really complimented the meal.  My friend had the salted cod on bread with pickles for her first course (she said it was great, I thought it was too salty but that's why I didn't order \"salted\" anything). For her second course, she chose the beef wellington which was simultaneously incredible and a bit of a let down. The meat itself was tender and flavorful, but the crust was too flaky and bland. It did not complement the meat well.  Our final course was the flourless chocolate torte with strawberry-something on top. The torte itself was delicious and the plating was gorgeous, but the strawberry-something was forgettable at best and poorly textured at worse.   I forgot about the bread! The first thing we got was two different kinds of bread with a very good green butter of some sort (I had a half a bottle of wine so I don't exactly remember every detail!)   Ultimately, the food was incredible and  the service experience was more than enough to make me look forward to coming back for the Farmers Feast and wine pairings. I would have liked it if the food presentations were a little bit louder (it was hard to hear most of the people who brought us food except for a tall young man and our server) but otherwise I have no complaints. Trisha took great care of us, making sure we were happy and satisfied and was pleasant but unobtrusive.",

Such a quiet, romantic location right in the heart of Phoenix. They serve a different menu every night, straight from their farm to your plate. The presentation was a treat for the eyes almost as much as the food was a treat for our tastebuds. The Parmesan Soup, and the Panna Cotta were my faves tonight. Janet loved the Fried Squash Blossom semi salad and the Amuse Bouche. Honestly, there wasn't anything we had tonight that didn't impress us - the chef presented some interesting flavor combinations that we really enjoyed, too.  Who knew a tomato sorbet would blend so well with the sweet flavors of our dessert? The wait staff was on top of it, refilling our water every time we got low, bringing the courses out in a timely manner without rushing us, and even taught us a bit about the history of the farm and restaurant itself. We had the four course tasting menu, since it was our first visit and we wanted to try it before going all in. We left satisfied, a bit full but not uncomfortably so, but I admit I was disappointed that we didn't go with the extra courses. Overall, a perfect anniversary dinner. We'll be back for the full experience soon!",

There is a special table set over to the side for special occasions. It has a wood burning oven decorated with beautiful lights. Perfect for a romantic dinner that feels secluded.  Every night the menu changes depending on what the chef prepares. The food is all locally grown whether on their farm or local farms. The food is fresh and you can taste it.   We decided to start our meal off with the cheese board. The cheese ranged from a local goat cheese to a delicious feta. They had a delicious sweet zucchini bread that was to die for.  For my meal I had a delicious pasta that consisted of roasted tomatoes and fresh cheese. It was superb. Renee was our server and she was perfect.   Take a stroll at night under the lights. It is one of the most romantic dates you'll have around phoenix.",

High quality mostly interesting dishes.                              Most of the food served is Astonishingly Amazing.                              Personal service with well timed plates.  Short Story Cons- Air Conditioning doesn't function properly                              Tasting menu is now only Chef's Choice                               The Tasting size Halibut is served over cooked and over salted (see photo)                              Corn was over used through the evening. The Chef picked it to be used                                CORN FOUR Times through out the dinner.                              Full size desserts are served with the tasting menu that seems strange after                                         the tiny tastings.                                 Longer Story- Quiessence is a high end farm to table sort of restaurant. I've been here many times and in the past have enjoyed the tasting menu. Under the current Chef/Owner things are slightly different and the chef picks out your dishes.   Our first course of five was Corn and Miso Soup. The miso was house made and they serve this dish table side with a squash blossom and caramelized eggplant. this dish is silky and amazing. Highly recommended  My second course was the Hamachi Crudo. It was three bites. They stacked up Kimchi, watermelon, cucumber, cilantro, garlic chips and cover it with tomato vinegarette and fingerlime. This for me was the most enjoyable dish of the evening with the most complexity and textures. It's so amazing you should drive across town just to try this dish. My husband had the Octopus and he said it was the best octopus he ever had and that dish was also his favorite dish.  Third course was Ricotta Caveltelli for both of us. This dish was more of a soup with sweet fresh corn, hatch chile, watercress, basil oil and topped with parmesan. This dish was among the amazing tasting dishes. The pasta was very delicate and micro sized. We both felt that this dish wasn't really a pasta dish because very little of it was pasta but who cares....it really was delicious.  My dinner was the Halibut. It was my THIRD dish of the evening that contained CORN and it also contained not one but two kinds of CORN....CORN relish and CORN puree.  I went to try the tiny piece of unforgiving halibut and needed a steak knife to cut a piece off. WOW it was dry and very over salted. I enjoy salty pretzels but this was much more salty than that and was like sucking on a spoonful of salt. See the photo you can actually see the salt. I did tell my server about the dryness of the fish and THE SALT and he did offer to get me another plate. But honestly I didn't want to spoil my husbands dinner to wait for another dinner to be prepared for me. Also after I tasted the fish it was so small I only had part of an ounce of fish left and it seemed ridiculous to send back such a tiny thing to the kitchen.   Lastly they fill up the table with large full size desserts that seem out of place after all the tiny tasting plates.  My favorite of the three desserts was the complimentary non-traditional Apple Cannoli. It was thin and very light and delicate tinted with a crisp apple flavor.   My least favorite was the Bread Pudding. It was very heavy and too rich for me to eat.  Liked the Sweet Potato Cake. Good flavor and it was smooth and well balanced.   Next time I'll call to see if the air conditioning is working and I will avoid the tasting menu.  Disappointed with a few things-  Lack of air-conditioning in the front dining room. Would prefer to pick my own dishes like I used too with the tasting menu My dinner was the one botched dish Chef did over use corn this evening by using it four times  On the other hand most of the of the food was astonishingly good.",

I made a reservation through open table and we were seated outside in a nice table on the lawn.  The cheese board was inventive, the soup was outstanding, and the steak was done to perfection.  We ended up having the apple cannoli for dessert and it was creative and amazing. Our server Robert was friendly and the atmosphere was soooo charming.  We have active kids, so getting a night out alone is a challenge--this was a GREAT way to spend an enchanting evening together under the stars with an amazing meal.  I will say we spent over 2 hours there so it's not a quick dinner--but it was nice to actually slow down and have time with my spouse & have an uninterrupted conversation.

We came here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and we each had the 6 course tasting menu. Everything was prepared with incredible attention to detail and tasted wonderful. It started with a an aperitif which was really a little espresso cup of soup and some bread. This didn't count as one of the courses, but it was delicious. The bread came with an amazing butter that had herbs and lemon in it.  Then our tasting courses started. We had a board with tons of small bites and spreads. Following this we had kabocha squash soup that came with this amazing relish and goat cheese in the bowl. After this I got a beet dish and my boyfriend got beef carpaccio. Both were outstanding. Then, we both got a pork belly stuffed pasta dish that came in a cream sauce that we wanted to drink out of the bowl! Our server gave us a small glass of dry gewurztraminer with this and it was the perfect pairing for the soup. For our entrees I had the best steak of my life and my boyfriend had this stuffed guinea hen. Our desserts were a bread pudding and vanilla panna cotta. We also ordered an espresso and coffee to finish off the night.  The tasting experience took about three hours but we never felt like we were waiting. Our server was so kind and knowledgable about the food. I also loved that all the food was so local down to the wine menu. The ambiance is beautifully quaint and romantic and is the perfect place for a luxurious date. I cannot recommend it highly enough!",

We were immediately seated at a lovely table at the front of the restaurant and our server took good care of us...although the time in between courses could have been tightened up a little bit.    I started with a Drunken Peach cocktail (so yummy) and shared the cheese & charcuterie with my husband - a beautiful board with so many amazing selections...the rhubarb leather was my absolute favorite.  Next we shared the absolutely delicious and flavorful seafood chowder (can I have this every week, pretty please?) and split the halibut and fettuccine dishes for our entrees.  It truly was a culinary delight and I can't wait to come back and have another very special dinner with such fresh and flavorful food.",

    "text": "Don't write many reviews, but felt compelled this evening for several reasons.  First let me qualify our group: we were 6; super food/wine cultured, very well traveled but also gracious when the food and or service surpasses expectations. That being said: service was a C grade. Waitress was super helpful/knowledgable and professional, when she was around...I, personally, had to pour wine for our guests and request ordered bottle water to be poured on more than one occasion. Also, we sat for more than 5 minutes with all wine glasses empty before anyone asked if we would like another bottle (unacceptable), then it had to be \"retrieved and chilled from cellar\".   Requested lights to be turned down as they were obtrusively bright and (inappropriate rock music)  too loud.  Food was an A-, nice presentation, fresh and thoughtful.  Value was: expensive but that was what we were expecting. Just wanting a little more ambiance/professional, attentive service for the $1,000+ bill for our group. Also upon entry no one to greet us, we ended up walking through restaurant, unescorted with no greeting or acknowledgement from staff.  Will not take other out-of-town guest here again. For this price point, a big disappointment.  Thank you.",

Those complaining that there was excessive time between dishes, clearly have never dined at a restaurant of this caliber. From start to finish, I was never bored, hungry, or frustrated with either chef or staff. Those complaining that the portions were too small should have chosen The Cheesecake Factory, Claim Jumper, or maybe considered eating a normal human portion. I left pleasantly full after a 5 course meal. I've dined in highly rated restaurants around the country and would count this restaurant among my top experiences. Everything was beautifully crafted, incredibly fresh, well balanced, and worth every penny.",

    "text": "The words \"Farm to Table Dining\", get thrown around too much, as every gastropub loves to use them.  But if you really want to enjoy a True farm to table experience then Quiessence is your restaurant.  Why?  Because it's actually on a farm.  Most likely your server will be able to tell you and point to exactly where each fruit and vegetable was picked.    For our last night in Phoenix, we wanted to do something special, and The Brick Oven Table at Quiessence seemed unique. This is a two person table that's off to the side of the restaurant, in front of a brick oven fireplace, with an 8 course tasting menu.  You will be asked if you have any dislikes or food allergies.  Past that, you are in the chef's hands for the evening.  If you are a picky eater, then this isn't for you.  But I've learned that if you trust a great chef with great ingredients, you will have an amazing meal.  Not all of our courses were the same, which is great for tasting lots of different things, if you don't mind sharing.  We actually had 13 different dishes when it was all said and done.  Amuse Bouche - soup of apple, goat cheese, mint, cherry balsamic, and croutons.  I knew from the first sip, we were about to enjoy a wonderful meal.  <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/quiessence-restaurant-phoenix?select=v29K0tikKyV2-YbM-j0Piw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/quie...</a>  Course 1 - Charcuterie & Fromage.  This was huge for a 1st course, shared or not.  The attention to detail was impressive.  Homemade jams and mustards were the perfect compliments to the various cheeses, cured meats, pates, nuts, dried fruit, pickled beets and veggies. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/quiessence-restaurant-phoenix?select=z3fjkj-5Rwvu9yBxlEo28A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/quie...</a>  Course 2 - Parsnip Soup - Mangalitsa Bacon, Crispy I'itoi Onion, Opal Apples, Parsnip Chips.  This was poured at the table, which allowed the parsnip chips to keep their crunch, and for the delicate apple slices to not get soggy. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/quiessence-restaurant-phoenix?select=tioHbwc0U_TrQefR0A807A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/quie...</a>  Course 3 A - Roasted Beet Semi Salad - Smokey Blue Cheese Dressing, Golden & Red Beets, Sunchoke Chips, Arugula, Apple, Hazelnuts.  I don't normally like beets too much, but loved these. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/quiessence-restaurant-phoenix?select=Q7pp8yRMkbkucHD-lK9vyQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/quie...</a>  Course 3 B - Maya's Foraged Garden of Seasonal Vegetables.  You are on a farm, so whatever looks good and ready to be picked will end up on this plate. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/quiessence-restaurant-phoenix?select=5C1MPPLBQan2DlGDJLq0ug\">yelp.com/biz_photos/quie...</a>  Course 4 A - Aged Wagyu Carpaccio - Golden Greens, Parmesan, Blue Cheese Aioli, Tempura Herbs, Pickled Ramps, Bread Spoons.  Beautiful presentation and my wife's favorite dish all evening. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/quiessence-restaurant-phoenix?select=ZCNPj2sZUjMQpG6zL6Op6Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/quie...</a>  Course 4 B - Hamachi Crudo - Citrus Salsa Verde, Citrus Caviar, Micro Cilantro, Garlic Chips.  This was impressively served on a Himalayan Salt Rock, thus lightly picking up the salt flavor to match against the sweet and acidic citrus.  The Hamachi was my favorite dish of the night. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/quiessence-restaurant-phoenix?select=Ic9F0vnHhZyUuynZQ6tknw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/quie...</a>  Course 5 - Potato Gnocchi - Guinea Hen Confit, Mascarpone, Rainbow Chard, Portablla, tomato, Fried Sage.  This course let me down a bit.  The gnocchi were pretty mushy, which was hard to ignore.  I did love the flash fried sage for some crunch. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/quiessence-restaurant-phoenix?select=00KERPlC75mtYN4w2nV8ZA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/quie...</a>  Course 6 A - Wild Black Cod - Sweet Potato Fumet, Eggplant Chips, Poached Tomatoes, Chive Creme Fraiche, Braised Greens, Baby Beet Tops.  Perfectly cooked fish and every ingredient worked in perfect harmony.  I loved how they just barely braised the greens, slightly wilted but still full of flavor. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/quiessence-restaurant-phoenix?select=dYG3yUC2Hr5VPIkXWDd7kw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/quie...</a>  Course 6 B - Mangalitsa Pulled Pork - Crimon Lentils, Roasted Apples, Arugula/Radish/Walnut Salad, Roasted Turnips.  This was for you to pull it, it was a solid piece of tender pork, slowly cooked so it pulled apart like a pot roast.  Another winner.  <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/quiessence-restaurant-phoenix?select=RK3hTs6uavh4s9n9u5TQ5Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/quie...</a>  And the desserts were just as good...  Course 7 - Honey Panna Cotta - Blackberry Broth, Blood Orange/Blackberry sorbet, Candied Citrus, Nasturtium Petals, Blackberries, Blood Orange, and Grapes. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/quiessence-restaurant-phoenix?select=PAl5dgpq8MARk7HOngPG6Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/quie...</a>  Course 8 - Apple Mascarpone Cannoli - Toasted Hazelnuts, Dulce de Leche, Green Apple Sorbet, Apple Chips, Candy Apple Dust. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/quiessence-restaurant-phoenix?select=vBmvowmrxt5tnTN1gJ1gXQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/quie...</a>  Course 9 - Dulce de Leche Bread Pudding with house made vanilla Ice Cream. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/quiessence-restaurant-phoenix?select=1iNSUwh1RCYtzCnHjoweMw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/quie...</a>  We had an amazing meal with fantastic service by Narah B.",

    "text": "This place is a must for foodies who are in search of an ethereal dining experience. There is nothing quite like Quiessence. First, the ambience just doesn't compare to anything else I've come across in Phoenix. It's located on a farm, and although a little strange at first when you drive in, that feeling is quickly canceled out by its magical setting. You walk down a dirt road into the most wonderful and serene dining atmospheres. Beautiful glowing lights all around you. And an outdoor scene that makes it feel like you're at a quiet wedding reception. I couldn't believe how the layout kept conversations at almost a whisper at all the tables both inside and out.   Now... the wait time, even if you have a reservation and you arrive on time, the hostess will not be seating you for about 25-30 minutes. That is not an exaggeration. I think the whole reason everything is so off time-wise is because the food takes forever to come to the table. We had several waiters and waitresses tending to our table throughout the night. If you are an impatient person, you may just want to walk out.   But DON'T, because the food is INCREDIBLE and worth the high price tag and wait time. And the way they bring out each course to you allows you to digest and just sit back and enjoy yourself. I realized the food takes forever because it's skillfully and artfully prepared and the waiters make it a great presentation when it finally arrives. The food hits all the taste notes, taking your palate on a joyride - crisp, light, airy, salty, savory, sweet, spicy and sour. Just simply fantastic. I've been to many fine dining restaurants and this is definitely a place that tops my list. Take 3 hours out of your night and go and enjoy Quiessence!",

Plus, the food is fantastic. The current crudo is packed with tons of flavor, and the gnocchi is like biting into a cloud. My steak was done expertly and all the veggies on the plate made it easy for the partner (who hates veggies) fall in love with their flavor.  We opted to eat inside this time and it was almost as intimate as eating at the brick oven.  I rarely like desserts but it's hard to pass up the superb combo of fresh apples, hazelnuts and creamy cannoli. This is definitely a place you don't want to pass at satisfying your sweet tooth.",

    "text": "I came here with my bf about a month ago. It was a late dinner but there were plenty of other people dining there as well. The waitress was odd but kind. Lingering a bit too long one minute and then not being there the next.   I asked if it was possible for my bf to have a meal from the 4 course menu put into the place of one on the 5 course menu. The waitress said the chef would be unable to accommodate that. This instantly ruffled our feathers. What chef, who already has a meal listed on the menu, is unwilling to accommodate a guest who dislikes fish and lamb? (Those were the only two main courses on the 5 course menu).  My bf shrugged and was resigned to knowing he wouldn't like his main course. The waitress, seeing this, did nothing.   Honestly, the only reason this place is getting any stars is because of the sunchoke soup with apple relish, the sturgeon, and the apple cannoli. The rest of the meal was just okay, while the opera cake with blood orange was really bad. But those three dishes I previously mentioned were really amazing. I felt that the lamb dish would've been elevated to another level if they had added the apple relish to it.  Overall, it's a beautiful restaurant that has potential to be really good. But I highly recommend that the chef learns to take substitutions, especially if it's something that is already on the menu. The waitress could also learn to speak on behalf of her customers rather than think, \"It is the way it is.\"",

    "text": "Quiessence is a beautiful restaurant. A converted home with a fantastic fireplace in the yard in a secluded part of Phoenix was, not so surprisingly, idyllic and relaxing. For a moment, I forgot I was in the desert.   The artisan & farmstead fromage board's presentation was impressive. The dried fruits reminded me of an Airbnb I stayed at outside of Yosemite where the hosts served me dehydrated fruits from their backyard. The roasted beet semi salad was a piece of art. And I don't even like beets that much.   The service was kind, but misfired once or twice. Some of the servers were more familiar with the food and wine than others. I told my server that I was vegetarian, and she asked me whether or not I ate stocks made from meat. I confirmed no, and was excited by her thoroughness. But when the fettuccine came out, she mentioned that my sauce had some sort of stock in it. Maybe she was going off of what she memorized, but I wasn't about to be that guy who asked for the entree to be re-made after the table waited 40 minutes for their food.   To be fair, the pasta had robust flavor. I should have asked for veggies as a substitution for the anchovies instead of just stripping out the fish.   Ask your server about the history of the restaurant. Weather permitting, sit outside. And watch your step walking over to the bathroom - the half step between the house and its expansion got me good.",

    "text": "Excellent! I took my girlfriend to Quiessence for her birthday not completely knowing what to expect. It is a quaint old farm house tucked away on the South Mountain Farm, and it oozes charm. My girlfriend and I are both vegetarians and the menu had plenty of options for us. We started with the artisan and farmstead Cheese platter (which you choose three cheeses from a list of about twenty-five) and it comes with candied dates, pecans, and apple slices; this was simply delicious. I continued with the Arizona citrus and romaine salad, topped off with fried shallot slices, and my girlfriend went with the cannellini bean soup; both were amazing. I finished with the farmer's cheese gnocchi with cauliflower, pine nuts, and raisins, and my date had the vegetable palette, which is a selection of that days fresh vegetables. The entire meal was transcendent, and trying to articulate how right everything was and felt is difficult to do.   The wine list is extensive and the service is fantastic. Quiessence is pricey, but completely worth it. In a city that sorely lacks upscale dining experiences, Quiessence is a breath of fresh air.",

    "text": "Fantastic meal.     Fantastic experience.       I am a vegetarian.    I cook a lot and am very conscious of food preparation, starting with sourcing.    I don't just patronize Farmers Markets, I patronize CERTAIN Farmers Markets....that sort of thing.    Long story short, if I am going to dine out, I want something very special.  VERY special.   Quiessence exceeded my expectations at almost every turn.    I dined there with my son and daughter-in-law...both truly expert cooks...more knowledgeable than I.       All of us were BLOWN AWAY by our meal.    We got the Farmers Feast without the wine pairings so we could choose our own wine.     I got the vegetarian...they got the carnivore (or ominvore or whatever they call it!).     Truthfully, labels are irrelevant.      It's all in the taste...and the tastes are sublime!  I was impressed by how much variety was in each plate.      Theirs were similar but each a little different.      More importantly, there was a marvelous progression of very carefully crafted flavors.        The most impressive thing:   The chef clearly wanted to offer his own interpretations .     That he did so while letting the fabulous ingredients speak for themselves is truly remarkable.  The setting is beautiful.     The servers are unpretentiously proud of their community and the work they are doing and seemed to enjoy our enjoyment as well.  Our only criticism (and it is minor)  is that although the desserts were beautifully crafted, we felt that they did not reflect the intentions of local sustainability.    There is so much wonderful local fruit (used in other courses, I might add!)...perhaps adding some to the desserts would carry out the theme more completely...I'm sure the chefs' creativity can conjure more ideas than I!  That said, I will return!    As often as possible!    Quiessence and the Farm at South Mountain are an unparalleled resource for the Phoenix community...easy to get to from any part of the Valley...no excuses, folks!...Go!",

    "text": "Go for the 5 star food and setting, but be warned about the 3 star service.    The menu lived up to all the high reviews posted by others.  Every dish was inventive and well done.  The salads were particularly noteworthy with the interesting and tasty use of local ingredients.    The service was odd.  They were attentive, but amateurish.  It started with a request for a wine recommendation. The wine menu is heavy on Arizona wines, which we don't know anything about.  I don't think our waiter knew much more than us, and the wine he recommended was barely drinkable.  Next we asked a question about the tasting menu.  The answer took some time because, we were told, the waiter wasn't allowed to ask the chef directly and had to relay the question through an \"expeditor.\" There were a lot of people helping us, but it was actually too much - it was distracting to have so many different people - and none of them seemed very well trained.  For example, we got our entree and asked about the puree on one plate.  Our waiter first guessed celery, and then said it might be cauliflower, and then someone else overheard the discussion and clarified that it was actually potato.",

I just wish execution could be more consistent.  Sometimes meals are remarkable and sometimes disappointing, which should not be the case with a restaurant of this caliber. My most recent visit on 12/30 was a bit more in the disappointing category.  We started with an assortment of cheeses which is always a great choice here. The wine list has some great options as well.  I especially appreciate the inclusion of several terrific Arizona wines (Page Springs and Pillsbury to name a couple). Things got even better with the Second course with the finest gnocchi I have ever tasted.  Unfortunately the entrees were much less inspiring. My sausage cacciotore was simply ok and my wife's bass was soupy, salty, and undercooked.  I will definitely be back because I love the property and the service is usually good, but going forward I am seriously considering sticking to wine, cheese, and pasta while skipping the entree course altogether.",

The waiter comes out overly friendly, with phoney smile as others on the staff. The truffel soup was like a bowl of salt water.  The Pasta dish was cheap dumplings with frozen peas and 2 mexican shrimps chopped up so small and yes a lot of salt. The Salmon  was bland but the mashed cauliflower under it was salty and not cooked all the way, the broclii was burned, we left half of our meals on our plates and no one asked why? The service was horrible we constantly had to ask the bus person to find us the waiter. Way Way overpriced and an added 18% service charge for poor service. They never said, thanks good bye or come again. I read so much good about The Farms that I really wanted to go, but it is a Never Again, does not deserve a 2nd chance, $180.00 for 2 and did not eat and 2 beverages. Also my stomach was very uncomforatable from so much salt,  I felt very nausiated.",

The food was vibrant and prepared to perfection, the staff was extremely knowledgeable, as if they were part owners and in the kitchen preparing it.  I use Yelp all the time, and have for years, but have never written a review.  I had to sign up today and write a review, that's how impressed I was.  5 stars just for the food.  The farm atmosphere, the staff, and the whole culinary experience should bring this up to 6 stars!  Yes, it is pricey, but worth every penny.

That's not a problem here:  the table is literally IN the farm.  If you don't watch your step walking in, you might just trip over your entree.  Despite the exceptional quality of the food, there were a few aspects of the experience that bring Quiessence down from the very top tier.  First, the service was a bit slow.  Second, we found the format of the tasting menu -- each person gets a different dish for each course -- a bit strange and off-putting.",

    "text": "We were in Phoenix for a few days to get away from the city.  I had been researching places to eat, because that's what we do when we travel.  We figure out what we want to see, what we want to do, and most importantly where we want to eat, from local dives to fine dining and anything in between.    We try to get in a nice meal while away.  This was it for this trip, and I am so glad it was.  I have been thinking about this meal since we dined here October 27th.  Our dining experience was memorable in every sense of the word.  From the drive down the long dirt driveway, opening up into a farming oasis.  Walking up we were greeted with a warm welcome from the hostess.  We were seated in the front room looking out into this awesome setting.  Amazing experience from start to finish.    I suffer from food allergies (mushrooms, egg yolks and walnuts), and Quiessence is one of those rare restaurants that not only accommodates food restrictions, they provide you with stellar options.  They didn't simply remove the allergy from the existing menu selections, they created new dishes for me.  For someone who has suffered with food allergies since childhood, this is an incredibly special gesture, one I will not soon forget.  We enjoyed the Chef's/Farmer's Feast, and it was just that, a huge delicious feast, at a steal for $65 each.  (In SF this would have easily been $100+ per person without wine pairing.)  Our entire experience here was beyond fantastic.  The food was incredible, fresh, local and creative, the portions were large for a multi-course meal, the wine recommendation was perfect (Robert Foley - Griffin), and service was impeccable.  Let's just say this...  during our meal we actually discussed the ridiculous thought of possibly flying in from the SF Bay Area, dining, then flying back the same night.  Yes, while incredibly ridiculous, we were both dead serious.  It was that good.  I cannot wait to return!",

We were allowed to order wine prior to hearing of the chef's feast, which offers a wine pairing.  That's dumb.  We ordered a meat/cheese plate.  It contained head cheese.  Hmmmm.  Overpriced and oversalted.  30 min later our salads came.  The salads were ok and unfortunately the highlight of the meal.  35 min later our main course came.  Overcooked, uneventful, lame.  I can't drink alcohol and ordered water.  Twice I was left w/ no water for extended periods.  Both times I was foced to ask for water.  There were no hand towels in the unisex bathroom.  It's no fun to dry your hands using toilet paper.  The \"best\" part was saved for last.  Quiessence automatically adds an 18% gratuity, which is OK assuming the service is at least adequate.  It wasn't.  Further, as our waiter dropped the bill, he explained the 18% \"goes to the house\" and anything additional we might addd, though not required, is most appreciated.  Egad....why does the house need a service charge w/ the magnificent margins they charge for their normal food service?  And why do they put their staff in the position of shaking down their patrons for tips?  Although it's a very nice, calming setting, I found myself wanting to leave after the first appy.  Food, service and ancillary were simply terrible.  Stay away.  You'll spend your $175 for 2 much better most anywhere else.",

    "text": "I had an amazing dinner tonight at Quiessence.  When we made the reservation they asked if we were celebrating anything; we were, so when we sat down we were given 3 glasses of complimentary champagne.    We started with a plate of three delicious cheeses.  They have a huge selection of cheeses, probably about 20, and we chose a goat, a smoked gouda and a jack.  All delicious and served with crostini, perfectly melt-in-your-mouth bartlett pears, pecans, honey and quince paste.  Great start.  Our next course we shared two salads - an octopus carpaccio and field green salad.  Both good.  My main course was AMAZING.  It was heritage turkey with mashed potatoes and carrots.  I ate every bite.  SO flavorful.  My dad had a beef sirloin that was perfectly cooked and delicious with a side of fingerling potatoes.  My mom got swordfish.  It was not cooked properly when it first came out, but they promptly corrected the problem, so i can't fault them for that.  The ambience was great including a live but not distracting singer and a warm crackling fireplace.  In addition, I want to give big props to the servers for knowing everything about the food they served.  She knew where the fish was caught, how the beef was raised, what certifications the turkey farm had achieved.  It is great to be able to get those kind of answers with zero attitude when you ask the question.  My only reservations would be 1) definitely is \"slow\" food, maybe a tad too slow but so delicious it was worth it and they said they were short staffed and 2) i'm not sure i buy that their seafood is sustainable.  They served atlantic cod and atlantic swordfish.  My understanding is that both of these fish stocks are pretty severely depleted.  I asked and was told that the fisherman they buy from are committed to sustainable methods, but I'm not sure (personally, for me, at least) that it is possible to sustainably fish a stock that is in danger.  All in all though, a fantastic night and i can't wait to return!",

We had the Farmer's Feast a few weeks ago - a great way to try many different options on the menu. It is $75 per person so it is not cheap, but you definitely get your money's worth of food - and the price is similar to what you would pay for appetizer, entree and dessert but you get WAY more food than that - a great way to go. Everything was great up to the meat entrees (special mention to the pasta dishes - wonderful!) Then it all became very salty. REALLY salty. My only recommendation if you order meat, is to ask them to not add salt, or easy salt, whatever. I would have loved to really taste the meat and not just salt.

For example, he couldn't tell us anything about more than half of the cheeses, and he didn't really know about the wine list.  The aspect that really annoyed me, however, was the restaurant's decision to impose an 18% \"service fee\" on ALL checks.  Thus, the restaurant has removed any discretion over what used to be a gratuity and has made it a mandatory amount.  I'm more than a fair tipper, so this really serves no purpose other than to antagonize me; it is as if the restaurant believes I'm too immature to properly calculate a tip or adjust the tip to account for the service provided.",

With no real bar area we were taken out back to the fire pit area and told a server would be a long to get us drinks.  After waiting 15 minutes, I went in and ordered myself.  We were eventually seated 30 minutes after our reservation.  They were then out of the entree I had chosen.  The courses came very slowly.  We had to send back my wife's entree as it was undercooked.  The only highlight was the pasta dish.  There are many better choices out there.",

    "text": "This has been one of my pricier dining experiences in the Phoenix, but also the most rewarding.  Where else can you show up to dinner wearing flip flops and shorts (not quite the norm, but acceptable) and try some of the most delicately prepared dishes featuring local produce/meats and paired with a great wine list--and then simply enjoy yourself in a relaxed environment.  I'm a huge fan of all the dining concepts at The Farm, but Quiessence clearly stands out as one of my favorite places here or anywhere (and yes, I dine out a lot for work and pleasure).  As a slow food restaurant, Quiessence places a strong emphasis on enjoying each and every part of the a la carte menu.  And the servers are professional and uniquely helpful in offering their advice about the selections.  On one visit, I inquired about the local vegetable platter and the server told me she would have to ask the kitchen because each platter is prepared to the chef's choosing on the spot.  Having no allergies or other concerns, I happily told her to forget it.  This is the one restaurant in Phoenix where you should let the chef make as many choices for you as possible.  If you have not yet tried Quiessence, I insist that this is the absolute best that Phoenix has to offer right now for an elegant or simply delectable but casual dinner.",

When the desert course (90 min into dinner) came we were already talking about what we would stop to get for food on the way home because we were still hungry. $300+ later we felt not only incredibly disappointed but hoodwinked.

    "text": "The setting is gorgeous but the food was awful--one of the worst meals we've had in a long time.  Alarm bells began to ring when I ordered a house made ginger-ale--one of four house-made sodas on their cocktail list--and it arrived flat. It then took us ten minutes to flag the server down and another fifteen to get the drink back. Second go: not flat, but not particularly tasty either. Next worry: of the two breads in the bread basket, one was stale and the other had no salt in it.   We ordered the six course tasting meal. First course was salumi and cheese accompanied by various crackers and bread rounds. All the crackers were stale; the bread served with the pate tasted as though it had been toasted and oiled several days previous. We didn't finish the plate.  Salad course was okay, although one of the salads (octopus, I think) was drowning in sweetish dressing. Third course pasta: I was served a pasta with Italian sausage and purslane, which was fine, except the purslane was very oily. My husband was given a gnocchi with some sort of cheese sauce; the gnocchi was heavy and the cheese sauce was like wallpaper paste.   At this point we considered leaving and hitting up a taco truck, but decided to tough it out since we were half way through. Fish course was almost inedible due to excessive saltiness, as was the final meat course: the pork dish I was given tasted like salt-pork that hadn't been rinsed and the green bean garnish was cold, while the rest of the dish was very hot. We left most of the food on the plates, and asked for the check, though we had a dessert course left. The server brought us the check and the desserts boxed up. They didn't survive the trip home, so can't comment on their quality.   The service was very amateurish. Some of the waiters had to read our course descriptions off a piece of paper. It often took ten-fifteen minutes for our plates to be cleared. My husband had the wine pairing; glasses arrived after their course, or way before.  None of this would have bothered us if the food had been good.  But it wasn't. We left disappointed and hungry.   I don't usually post negative reviews, but the meal was so disappointing, and the other yelp reviews are so positive, that I felt our an opposing view was warranted. Perhaps they were having an off night and our experience was unusual. I hope so. The setting is wonderful and I certainly applaud their farm to table mission.",

    "text": "So, we were in Phoenix to celebrate my boyfriends birthday and I wanted to take him some place that we could never find in Chicago and boy did I accomplish that goal! We found out upon arriving that it was actually their last night of the season. They close for a month during the summer because its obviously too hot in Phoenix to grow anything sustainable and given that their menu and the concept of the restaurant is to use local ingredients, it obviously cant be done in 115 degree weather. SO, we totally lucked out.  We once again sat outside (theme of the weekend), it was way too cute out there not to. My boyfriend is a bit of a food snob, so the minute I saw the Chef's tasting menu I knew he would be all over it and he was. So, off we went down a road of 6 magnificent courses. We started off with the Chef's antipasta platter. It had about 4-5 different types of cured meats and 2 cheeses to choose from as well as a crostini with a pork puree on it. Everything was delicious! I even had the head cheese and was pleasantly surprised how good it actually was. I just kept telling myself not to think about the actual ingredients ;) We moved onto the second course and I had the Melon Cucumber Salad, which was so light and so refreshing and the dressing was a delicious pecan vinaigrette, it was SOOO good. My boyfriend had the Seafood and Corn Chowder and that was tasty as well, he really enjoyed it. Next we moved onto the third course and I had the chittara cut spaghetti with cherry tomatoes, and pork belly. It was magnificent. The taste of the tomatoes and then the pork belly were delicious. My boyfriend had the Rainbow Valley Farmer's Cheese Gnocchi, it was in a mushroomy, creamy delicious sauce. Our fourth course was the fish course and we were both served the marlin. It was cooked perfectly on a wood grill and you could really taste the smoky flavor and the fish was like butter, it just melted in your mouth. It was to die for. The fifth course was the meat course (my least favorite of the courses) and I received the Milk Braised Ham. It was more of a pork stew on a bed of mashed potatoes. I'm not much of a meat eater to begin with and this just wasn't my dish. My boyfriend had the Wild Boar Sausage and he thought it was magnificent.  By this point I was straining to breathe I was so full! Our last course was of course dessert and I had the panna catta and it was very light and creamy and omg it was so good. It had bits of corn in it and was topped with little croutons. It was heaven. My boyfriend had some kind of apple bread and he loved that as well. Oh, and let me point out that the sweet bread with the chive butter when you first sit down is absolutely to die for. The bread was nice and warm and the butter melted and omg it was delicious.   The only gripes I would have about the restaurant is maybe the lack of our primary server. She was a little slow on getting us drinks, I sat without one for 2 courses and didn't offer us coffee or tea with our dessert. This point really bothered my boyfriend! He usually has coffee with his dessert and she didn't offer it up until after we had finished our dessert and were waiting on the check. We just felt if we are going to spend that kind of money on a tasting all elements should be there and it sort of lacked.   Taylor or other waiter was PHENOMENAL! He was very knowledgeable on the food and where it came from and what we should expect when we taste it, etc. You could tell he has a True passion for the restaurant and the food they were serving and he did an excellent job presenting each course to us.   At the end the Chef signed our menu for us, it was definitely a nice touch and a nice way to end the meal!",

Then, the restaurant apparently was sold to a new owner (nobody knew this at the time. The website said the menu was being \"redeveloped\") and was closed for a long period of time. Our gift card expired during this wait. I reached an employee at quiessence and told her of our problem. She told me to write to some address in the southern part of the state where the old quiessence owner is. I was told he would take care of the issue. Waited, waited, no response. I called quiessence back and spoke to another employee who said it was too late for anything to be done, and they wouldn't honor the gift card because by would lose money. No offer of help, no apology, just \"oh well\". I'm disappointed and felt like his was very bad customer service. We are valley residents who love the farm kitchen and morning glory. We also love fine dining. 125$ was paid and dissapeared.  We will not bring our business to a place that could have done more to make things right.",

    "text": "This place was simply AMAZING!  We enjoyed a VERY romantic evening in the Front Solarium room at Quiessence, on a rainy night that set the perfect backdrop for our 7 course tasting menu.  The tasting far exceeded our expectations and delighted our palates as plate after plate delivered new and exciting tastes with each course.  The wine pairing with each plate was astounding and the chef seemed to thoroughly understand and translate each ingredient across the board.  Our tasting included, but not limited to, the Foraged Garden (an absolute MUST), the Charcuterie, Roasted Cauliflower Soup, Smoked Pork Shoulder Cappelletti pasta dish, Grilled Mediterranean Sea Bass, Grilled Pork Chop, and desserts that complimented the dishes exquisitely.  I would highly recommend anyone to enjoy this fantastic restaurant to any and everyone who comes to the Phoenix area.  If the menu is intimidating, let the servers or chef recommend or make suggestions.  This isn't just a dinner, it is an experience. The Chef, Dustin Christofolo, really knocked it out of the park!",

    "text": "I was spending a weekend in Phoenix and on a hunt for a nice NYE dinner.  I was a little disappointed that it was a Prix Fixe menu because I was so excited by what I'd seen on the menu.  No matter, the prix fixe had sufficient options.  It was a dark and cold night.  The Farm is not well lit and easy to miss if you don't know where you're going.  Parking isn't great, with an unpaved lot and no lines to force cars to park reasonably close to one another.  But then you walk up and you really feel like you're out on a farm.  And I now understand why farmers don't wear high heels.  It's pretty hard to walk gracefully on an uneven, unpaved surface.  My biggest complaint is that it was so dark, it was hard to appreciate the ambiance of The Farm.  I would like to go back and see it in the daylight.  Also, the cold forced us straight into the restaurant.  Which is very pretty, cozy, and intimate.  Tables aren't too close together and you can't hear other conversations - except for the drunk guy a few tables away, but then he left.  Service was good.  No complaints.  Helpful and knowledgeable.  I wanted more extensive descriptions of the menu so I could make my selections and our waiter was familiar with each dish and able to describe each well enough to make me drool.  I was pleased.  Food was excellent.  Not salty, like so many yelpers complained. The seared tuna was definitely fresh.  I don't even like tuna normally and I really liked it. The fois gras was well paired with toast and preserves - and also rich and creamy on its own. The lobster bisque was unlike a typical heavy cream-based bisque but rather lighter and brothier.  Since it wasn't in front of me, I only got a few spoonfuls in before it disappeared. The ravioli was my absolute favorite.  Homemade pasta is really the best thing in the world.  Cooked to perfection, not mushy and not chewy.  And a light shaving of truffles on top to complement the flavors without overwhelming.  I really could have just had another bowl of ravioli for my entree and been happy. The sausage was moist and buttery.  I've never had sausage like it before. The duck was a tad overcooked but still good.  I actually liked the sauteed greens on the side better.  But I still ate it all. I was already full by the time dessert rolled around.  It was good but not exciting compared to the rest of the meal. Specialty drinks are good - a must try!  I don't know why others had negative experiences, but we thoroughly enjoyed our new years eve.  PS they don't take discover.",

    "text": "After recommendations from our Phoenix resort and reading the many good reviews on the internet about this restaurant, my husband and I were very much looking forward to our dinner tonight.  We are not novices about good food, we travel frequently and have experienced MANY GREAT dinners.  I can't describe how disappointed we were.    The food was awful, very overly salted and generally bad.  We ordered the Farmer's Feast for two which allowed us to sample more than ten menu items.  The feast was described as a selection by the chef of a menu designed for us.  We noticed many of the tables were also ordering the feast which turned to be the same collection of smaller portions of many of the menu items that were served to us.  The server wouldn't even tell us what we were going to be served, she said it would be a surprise.    Maybe we were there on an off night but out of ten items my husbands salad and the breads were the only really good food items.  EVERYTHING except those two items and the deserts was SO overly salted and in the case of the lamb, totally over cooked that we were really surprised.  The home made sausage tasted like sawdust.  We drank more than three full glasses of water to tamper the salt.  I even asked if the regular chef was cooking in case there was some new and/or less experienced chef preparing the food and that the heavy handed use of salt was an anomaly.   The regular chef was cooking tonight.   It was expensive, our bill was $291 which included two cocktails and one bottle of wine and food for two for $150.  There was an 18% service charge of $40 which we assumed was the tip.  I have a problem with including a tip on the check as we are good tippers for service and like to make our own mind up on what to leave the servers.  We don't mind spending a lot of money on a good meal.  This meal was not worth $291.  I would not recommend this restaurant unless you like really salty food.",

    "text": "If you're searching for foodie hidden treasure in Phoenix, turn your back on the strip malls. You need look no further than Quiessence, \"A Garden to Table Experience.\" As the BF pointed out, \"This is what Binkley's should aspire to be.\"  The philosophy of the restaurant centers around local and seasonal ingredients. Quiessence is a showcase for local growers such as McClendon's. The provenance of nearly every ingredient is noted with strong connections to Arizona. Chef Greg LaPrad's food is not only local, seasonal, sustainable and responsible, it's also delicious.  This is the kind of place that does Alice Waters proud.  Since Quiessence depends upon the best seasonal ingredients, the menu changes nightly. The BF and I had the six-course tasting menu. The portion sizes were perfect and the wine pairings were good.  Amuse Bouche:  As it should be, we were given a bite of apricot stuffed with local cheese and kissed by mint that left us wanting more.  Course 1: \"The Chef's Spread,\" a tasting of housemade salumi, terrines and cheese. It's nice to know the Quiessence Charcuterie and Salumi program grew out of the desire to use every bit of the animals purchased for the restaurant. The accompanying housemade carrot, zucchini and yellow squash pickles were delightful.  Course 2: Chilled salad of cantaloupe, Armenian Cucumber, tomato and housemade croutons in a yogurt and dill dressing. It's rare that I call a salad course fabulous. The BF and I are going to shamelessly steal the idea and replicate it for our next dinner party.  Course 3: Housemade gnocchi with pork ragut. My family on both sides traces its roots back to Italy, so I am picky with Italian food. Sous chef Anthony Andiario's handmade cheese-infused gnocchi were spectacular and the ragout was perfect. The bowl had been properly warmed to keep the dish at temperature while I luxuriated in it. Our server initially forgot to bring us the wine for this course, but it arrived about halfway through.   Course 4: Fried soft shell crab with zucchini. Neither the BF nor I like soft shell crab. However, this version was so perfectly prepared that we both savored every bite. The zucchini in a savory sauce was a perfect contrast to the seafood.  Course 5: Pork tenderloin with bean and mustard \"gruel.\" The pork was tasty and tender, but it was served fully pink in the center. We were fine with this, but some diners may not be as open-minded to rare pork. I liked the side dish, but the BF did not because it contained beans. The \"gruel\" was mondo ugly on the plate. Speaking of the plate, the tasting version came on a really awkward piece of china that curved up on one side to form a well for the gruel and then back down on the other side to create a small area for the pork slices. The plate felt crowded.  Up to this point, dinner was utterly sublime and Quiessence was on its way to a perfect five star rating.  But then, alas, a star was lost with dessert.  Course 6: Sampling of cheesecake, pink grapefruit sorbet and chocolate \"torte\" with peach ice cream. These were classic \"chef's desserts;\" a cook made them but not someone with pastry skills. Chef Greg, please get yourself a pastry chef. With the access that your restaurant has to the freshest ingredients, your desserts should be a revelation. The best item was the pink grapefruit sorbet. It was tangy and refreshing and would have made a great intermezzo. The citrus zest cheesecake was okay, but a bit dense. The peach ice cream was fine. The chocolate \"torte,\" however, was an abomination. The BF theorizes the cake fell as it was grainy and lumpy. At first, I thought it was either supposed to be cheesecake or some sort of chocolate bread pudding. I confirmed with the server it was a \"torte.\" I cannot believe the kitchen allowed that mess to be served and it went back virtually untouched. The sad part is that was our final impression of the restaurant. Dessert cannot be an afterthought or lazy. The wine for this course was tawny and it did not complement the citrus flavors.    Putting the huge disappointment of dessert course aside, Quiessence was wonderful. We'll be back as this place would be a perfect showcase for guests or a special occasion. Next time we'll try the Brick Oven Table. It's a magical table outside in its own little cabana wrapped with mini white lights. It features an improvisational $95 pp eight-course meal that the chef and sous chef prepare for two to six people.  Quiessence features a relaxed atmosphere. The interior is neutral and many of the decorative items appear to be from Marshall's. The environment is pleasant enough and does not distract from the food, which is the real star of the show.  Your AMEX had best be prepared for a workout. The tab for the BF and I came to just over $310 with tax and tip. That included the $75 pp six-course tasting menu and the $40 pp wine pairings.  Please note that Quiessence is closed for the month of July.",

When I first moved out here from the Bay Area, the first thing I noticed was how un-diverse (this is most likely not a word) the Valley is; from the people, to the stores, to restaurants, to the actual foods.   Quiessence was one of my first interactions in Phoenix with good food, great service, and a great environment.   The first thing you will notice is the little driveway leading up to the restaurant. The deeper you get, the less of the city you feel. When you finally pull up to the entrance you will be fully engulfed with a small town/ranch feel. The inside is beautifully lit with candles and is lined with wonderful wood. The outside is great as well, as it is surrounded by white and pink flowers, with no signs of a city at all.   The food was excellent. We went with a 6 course sampler. The server told us that the menu is changed everyday as to change with farmer's specials and the chef's obsessions for that day. Another great thing is that the restaurant supports local farmers and goods. Also, while me and the folks don't drink wine nor ordered any, the wine person (not the actual term I'm sure) is quite knowledgeable from what we heard. He was able to explain fully, why each glass was the right choice for that particular course.  This is a rushed review because I hate typing, but so far, this has been the food highlight of my Valley experience.",

    "text": "Hugely disappointing.   I had wanted to try this restaurant for a long time but it did not come close to meeting my expectations.   I disagree with the reviewer who said this is what Binkleys should aspire to be.   The surprise Brick Oven tasting menu appeared to be everything they needed to use up.  Shellfish followed by more shellfish followed by fish.  Nothing creative that you could say wow that was worth paying $385 for 2.   What I was hoping for was a unique, creative tasting menu, artfully paired with wine in a beautiful outdoor setting.    This is what we got:  We arrived a few minutes early and were seated immediately.  We had to sit inside as it was cold and there are no heaters, ok not a problem.  The staff explained we would not be seeing a menu and we would be adventurous..   After 10 minutes a glass of sparkling wine arrived.  We were told this one glass would be the pairing for the first 2 courses  First course, 1 oyster on the shell   I dislike oyster so husband ate mine.  Home made bread with honey & herb butter.  - nothing special Plate of salami  - dull Bean soup - good Mussels with linguine. - I don't like mussels so I sent mine back and got gnocchi instead which was good Salmon with potato - ok Steak with carrots - meat was not tender 3 cheese plate - goat cheese, humbolt fog and ripe camembert   - This was the best thing we had.   Apple crisp and cheesecake -  very disappointing, could have bought better in AJs. French press coffee was ok but the octagonal cups are not comfortable to drink from.  The wine pairings were ok but the service was so slow we usually finished the wine before the matching course arrived.  There was no bouche amuse but there was a palette cleanser of fruit sorbet.    The bathroom.  - This was located very close to tables where people were eating and if it was occupied you find yourself standing in the dinners space.  There was an open basket of used hand towels on the floor to add to the ambiance.",

It's an unpaved parking lot with grass and uneven cobble stones, so just wear pretty flat for dinner.  This was almost a 5 hour experience by the way...we arrived a little before our reservation (we were the only ones with the special menu and had the same table all night) and had a lovely server. She was sweet and southern and took care of us the entire night.  We were served 8-10 courses, all divine. The Charcuterie board took the longest to make (first course) but it was well worth the wait. Great cheese, dried fruit, pate, lovely textures and it all flowed well. I mentioned how long it took, all was good since we also added the wine pairing to the dishes.   Highlights for us were the Hamachi, preserved lemons on diff dishes, the fresh veggies form their garden, the most amazing and crispiest bacon in our corn soup...I preferred the panna cotta than the hazelnut cake..great service, we got a visit from Marvin the local cat. It was a wonderful and charming experience. We have recommended this restaurant to multiple friends.",

The 4-course menu for 2, with 1 wine pairing and included gratuity, was outrageously overpriced at $400 for salad, pasta, pork chop, diver scallops and shared dessert consisting of a few cookies, sorbet and 1small chocolate thing. I feel ripped off.    I counted 4 pieces of pasta in my pasta dish and 8-items on my salad plate.  2 minuscule pieces of bread.  What's even worse was that we had to sit there fo 3 hours because they couldn't manage their kitchen. By the end, all we wanted was just to be able to leave.  I felt like a food hostage.   I dont know what I'm madder about, my wasted money or my wasted time.",

There was no time as the tasting took 4 hours, with excessive periods of time between each course. For the second course, 4 cheese boards were delivered to serve 5 couples. The wine pairings were meager portions. The food was good but not great. The service was also good but not great. Members of our party were frequently left with empty glasses. Those smart enough to not choose the wine pairing had 1 or 2 drinks total across the 4 hour meal. I love tasting menus and have participated in many across the US. Quiessence was one of the most expensive yet the only experience that was mediocre. If you want a spectacular dining experience with amazing food, go elsewhere.",

Our server explained a brief background of the place and the menu. She was great in terms of service and was knowledgeable regarding the dishes. Each dish was unique and well-balanced in terms of the composition and matched extremely well with each wine. We loved how each course was prepped, which reflected the chef's passion for cooking.

They served us the wrong cocktail to start off, placed the wrong meal in front of us, and the food runners that were serving the food could not explain the dish being served.  For two people the price was $500 and with the staff knowing we did not enjoy the experience they did not do anything to make it right (except give us a $50 gift card to come back which we will be giving away).

They started us with delicious bread and butter and olive oil before the course started. The chef's board was comprised of meat, cheese, and fruit and was heavenly. The Pistachio Soup might have been my favorite course with pork belly croutons and goat cheese mousse. Yum!! Next was a beet salad that tasted so fresh followed by a pasta course. The pasta and sauce was like and delicious. Our entrees came next. I had the trout and my boyfriend had the duck. The trout had the most delicious salty skin and my mouth is watering just thinking about it! We finished with dessert and I was sadly too full to eat a ton. We shared the bread pudding and the hazelnut chocolate pie. So good!   The entire meal took about 2.5 hours, and we had a a romantic experience.

    "text": "This was a wonderful birthday experience.   My birthday falls just after Valentine's Day, so they were still serving the 4 course fixed Valentine's menu which was perfect  for us, but some other diners seemed surprised by this.  We started with a couple delicious and unique cocktails at the bar before moving on to our table.  We requested to sit inside since it was a bit chilly and I am not a huge fan of outdoor dining anyway.  We were seated by a window on the \"porch\", which alowed a great view without actually being outside.   It was however still a bit chilly  I would have appreciated a space heater or something.  The service was friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient without being overbearing.  Dinner was fabulous.   From the pistachio soup, gnocchi, and salad to the perfectly cooked duck breast to the breads, and delicious bread pudding dessert, we enjoyed every bite.  They did offer a wine pairing option, but we chose to get a bottle from their excellent wine list which had a great variety of varietals and price points.  There  were only a few very picky things that could have made it better.  First, on Open table we were only able to get a reservation at 5:45 which was a bit early for us.  We were there until after 8 and the place was never even close to being full, so not sure why we couldn't have come later.  Second, while the duck was cooked perfectly and delicious, it was a bit on the cool side.  Not sure if this was intentional or not but my husband and I both agreed it could have been a tad warmer.  Lastly we were fortunate to catch that 20% gratuity had automatically been added to the check.  We didn't see anywhere on the menu that this would happen and the server didn't mention it either.  Now, we would have tipped at least this anyway, but we nearly tipped double that before we noticed the addition.   This place is pricy, so that would have been an expensive mistake!  Other than these small things, it was a magical experience, and we look forward to going again  for a special occasion.",

Came for the 5 course tasting on NYE, each course took about an hour to be served, with no apologies from management or the servers. I've eaten at fine dining restaurants all over the world, and I know that the experience is not to be rushed. However, courses are usually well-timed, and the servers don't ignore their tables to avoid confrontation.   The front of the house staff carried on as though nothing was wrong. All the diners were visibly upset and the entire night was mismanaged. My boyfriend finally asked our server what was going on with the food and that was the first time the problem was acknowledged. We talked to the manager who was in denial about the state of the evening, and made no apologies until we expressed our dissatisfaction. If the servers were more cognizant   My boyfriend asked for half of our meal off, and his request was granted. Thank goodness he did, because although we received a discount the meal still cost upwards of $300. I sincerely hope the other diners had the sense of doing the same thing. In addition, this restaurant had the audacity to threaten a $50/person 48hr cancellation fee, for a dinner service that they could not handle.   Long story short, I could not recommend this place less. The food was good but not enough to make up for the clueless management and staff.",

Here at Quiessence, the incredibly creative farm-to-table concept feeds you their love straight from the garden to your soul. This lovely quaint romantic spot competes right up there with your 5-star steakhouses. The uniqueness of the menu changes year round so I happen to visit during Restaurant Week. The menu was exquisite from the butternut squash soup to the filet mignon, to the celebratory cannoli and bread pudding. Service is efficient without the sacrifice of being personable and friendly. I adore moonlights and would have dined under the pecan trees but it was rather hot. So if you dine here in the later fall months, I highly recommend it. You will love it very much...fall quickly, love fully, and most importantly love naturally - the food, the atmosphere and hopefully your company.",

    "text": "Quiessence is a quirky place- located in a very romantic setting on an old pecan farm in South Phoenix. Lots of little lights and we sat by a fireplace. The restaurant seems to meander throughout many rooms and areas - we were told there was a party of 40 people somewhere in a private room - although we never saw or heard from them. The area we sat in was small and had only a few tables. So it was (as the name suggests) an intimate, peaceful experience.   Bottom line: the food was not memorable. There is a story attached to everything, as told by the wait staff, from the name of the place to the garden to the daily-changing menu, Arizona wines, etc. The prices are not to be sneezed at - we had a choice of 3 entrees that evening and they were each above $40. They suggest you order 2 or 3 courses to get 'the full experience' - we tried a parmesan soup, carpaccio appetizer and an entree. After all the talk and fanfare about freshness, and the warning on the menu that everything takes TIME (which it does: we sat at 7:15, got our drinks at about 7:45 and first food arrived at 8:45 - which is a long time!), the food was truly blase. I had a puree of some sort (about 2 tblspoons) that was totally without flavor - the fish was not remarkable in texture or flavor, etc. The pork was 'ok' - but a little tough. The carpaccio was a little salty - you get the idea. We skipped dessert because it was after 10pm by the time we finished eating and we didn't dare order anything else for fear we'd be asleep by the time it came. Also, I literally left hungry - about 2.5 ounces of fish with 2 peapods on top and the aforementioned puree. Soup and apps were similar - tiny portions served with much aplomb with a LOT of empty time left in between. If the food had been really good, it would have been well worth it all. But it just wasn't!",

    "text": "On a trip where I ate at some very nice and upmarket restaurants, I looked back at my notes on Quiessence and found it hard to decide on its Yelp star rating. The quality of the food almost took it down to 3 stars but in the end, their attempt to be really interested and concerned about the provenance of their produce raised it to 4 stars. I felt that I could really taste the difference with the quality of the ingredients used.  The restaurant itself has a really rural feel to it despite being minutes from metropolitan Phoenix. The long driveway off the main road seems like a step into another world and the long walk from the car park to the low rise restaurant adds to the distinct impression that you're in the country. The interesting history of the restaurant and its associated projects on the grounds are explained in the menu. There is a changing daily menu and the use of fresh local produce is commendable.  Unfortunately, for me personally, it just all felt a little sterile and there wasn't much atmosphere in the place. Unlike some over-posh city establishments, I had expected more of a buzz and hubbub in this quaint restaurant but it was almost the opposite. The staff were efficient enough but lacked the True warmth of natural hosts. There was also the amusing view of them bringing in all the dishes from the kitchen which must have been in another building as they were carrying plates in from outside. This became especially interesting when it started raining.  I started with a board of charcuterie and cheese, which was almost the best course as you could taste the top class ingredients in their pure form. I was interested to taste a pluot for the first time, which was a cross between a plum and an apricot.  The next course of squash salad was average and not very exciting.  Perhaps the worst dish of the evening was cheese pasta with sausage that just had the wrong balance of ingredients. Too heavy for my liking.  However, the next course of steelhead with heirloom tomatoes was much better with perfectly cooked fish accompanied by some super sweet mis-shapen (yay!) tomatoes.  Unfortunately, this was followed by braised lamb that had unfortunately been over-seasoned.  The most spectacular course of the evening was the amazing dessert board. There was melon carpaccio with strawberry, goat's cheesecake, lemon cream, crumb cake, a cookie and truffles.  It's a real shame as I had really wanted to like Quiessence before I dined there but the overwhelming feeling as I left was that it could have been so much better.",

Quiessence follows the \"Slow Food\" way as a philosophy and Greg and Dustin utilize the local produce from Maya's Farm to create delicious and simple rustic new American fare. Do not expect seeing Scottsdale waifs with big racks drinking red bull  and vodka here. The only chicks your going to see are baby Guineafowl scratching for bugs outside your urban farm window.

    "text": "The bar is set quite high and nearly attained...  Quiessence is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley.  There is much to enjoy and highly recommend this little gem (also recommend their lower key sister restaurants also at the farm).  High marks are earned for a remarkably creative menu and lovely space.  My partner and I tend to choose Quiessence for a celebratory meal and usually choose the tasting menu which when ordered for two allows one to taste most everything on the menu.  After living in Europe and traveling to far corners of the globe, I am admittedly something of a food snob.  My bias belief is that the higher a restaurant attains the less forgiveness for error.   Our rating for the 12 plates we tasted on Saturday, 9 would earn 10 out of 10, 2 would rate at 8 and one a 3.  I would gladly concede that the 8's where of the same creativeness as the 10's and perhaps not quite to our taste preference.  The 3 rating was surprising and keeps me from placing Quiescence on my global list of favorites.  The 3 in this case was the swordfish.  'Slightly' salty would be an understatement.  Whether this was 'as planned' or a very salty faux pas is hard to know.  We did suggest to our server that she may want to mention this to the Chef; whether she did and whether there was an answer we don't know.   Very noteworthy were the Salmon, Meat Balls, Gnocchi and Eggplant Soup. I am not a fan of noisy, over decorating venues and for us Quiessence is spot on.  Pleasant music is played at a volume that compliments the experience and allows for great conversation.  Decor that is subtle and doesn't over power.  One more suggestion that may be more of a personal preference is the lack of personality and sincerity of the service staff.  Service is always attentive and pleasant, but have never felt that the servers allow any of their personality to become part of the experience.  Perhaps we are in the minority and there are more that prefer a less personal service.",

The previous year we celebrated at the celebrated 5-star restaurant \"Marie Elaine's\" at the Phoenician (which I think has since closed and turned into a different kind of restaurant).   It is to this that I'm comparing the experience.  The housing is small and intimate and even so, I didn't feel crowded. (I'm imagining folks who have read my other reviews rolling their eyes and saying \"yes yes, we know you have space \"issues.\")  Here's what I loved best about the place: The food was wonderfully normal yet interesting (read: unpretentious -- no venison stew cooked over leaks and served in a copper pan.) The wait staff was knowledgeable and friendly (read: they weren't in tuxedo's with attitudes); and the atmosphere was relaxed (read: There was a live blues guitarist - no elevator music; you can dress up or down; and the food was well timed and not rushed).  I've heard that people complain that Quiessence is too expensive for the experience.  I say PHOOEY!   The food is fresh and organic.  The food selection is interesting and unique.  And the experience is special (read: NOT Scottsdale).     This place is off the beaten path and I'm sorry we waited three years to experience it.  Mea Culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa.",

For starters the restaurant is in the middle of a working farm, so the driveway is gravel and the grounds are covered in wood chips.  My wife and I rather enjoyed that, if it's something that's going to wreck your evening then don't come.  The dining area is somewhat cosy, if you're looking for a cavernous area full of shadowy corners this is not it.  Which is not to say you can't have a romantic meal, you just have to be willing to be near your fellow man.  The food was absolutely fantastic, and the wine pairings were superb.  The staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt when we needed something.  Here's another point, dinner takes a while, if you're looking to shovel food down your maw and bolt then you're in the wrong restaurant. Courses are served in a laid back fashion, with plenty of time to look deeply into each others eyes and enjoy your wine.    So if you're looking for a nice dinner, in a quaint environment, with a wonderful service staff then Quiessence will suit you just fine.",

The service was poor (the wait staff did not seem to be well-trained); the individual dishes served were generally good, certainly fresh, but there was insufficient thought given to what went with what.  In all other restaurants we have ever been in, a tasting dinner has been served in small dishes so that everyone can share.  At Quiessence, they were served on normal dishes, but only one of each for the two of us.  Very awkward -- for example, how do you share a bowl of soup without it getting cold for one person or the other?  The main dishes were both pasta and meat dishes, but they were so different that it was a jarring taste experience to have a bit of one followed by a completely unrelated taste of another.",

Prices beginning at $75 per person without wine for the Pre Fix menu and mandatory that EVERYONE at the table must order it in order for one person to have it, began our frustration with this place.     It took our waiter an extremely long time in between each request  of, 'a fork, water, bread, wine, each course, etc.' and our dining experience continued for 3 hours - without dessert, and it was a birthday celebration.  Entirely too long and not enough attention for the mandatory gratuity at the end.     The prices were absolutely OUT OF LINE with the food delivered. Our waiter was arrogant, seeming to know and deliver more information about why they 'don't offer whole wheat pasta as an alternative', etc. etc.     Every other food item listed on the menu was unknown by all 6 of us college-educated adutls.  This alone made it difficult to know what we would be eating and paying for.  We questioned the waiter about it all, but it makes for an uneasy feeling, not knowing if the one ingredient in our salad, or entree would change the taste to the point of not enjoying it.     In an attempt to find something I could order without meat or a cream sauce, I ordered the pasta with a request to have the cream sauce substituted with Olive Oil.  I was delivered an entirely different meal.  The waiter and or the chef decided that i should get the vegan dish instead.  I have never had this experience and it was quite unusual, so say the least.  The waiter didn't apologize, but said the chef thought i would be happier with the other dish.     We were compensated by not having to pay for this vegan dish, without having to ask, but I was not happy with this service, when I was the paying customer.     The $15 antipasta plate had 2 small triangle of cheese, 2 very thin slices of salami and a bread stick.  Really!  Everything was alacarte if you didn't do the Pri Fix.  We finally asked for bread after we had been in our chairs for 30 minutes, starving for a morsel of food that didn't have a price on it.  Customary, ESPECIALLY at any 5 start restaurant!     Too far to drive, too expensive, and NOT reflective of all the reviews and hype.       The worst part is that we were stuck having to pay an 18% gratuity regardless of the quality of our service.  This is America, where the wait staff earns tip money above 15%.  They have some work to do on their menu, their staff!, and their values.",

Paris James, their musician that night, was outstanding. I'd listen to him play every day for the rest of my life.   However, when I left and headed home, everything turned from great to oh-my-god-i-want-to-die agony.   So, I will sum up this review with two words: FOOD POISONING!",

We sat outside and enjoyed a 3 course meal with drinks.  It is sort of pricey, but completely worth it.  Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Update: The restaurant has undergone a complete revamping of staff and menu, so the following is a review of the old establishment. I'll try the new one soon and am  praying it's still great, but it's now related to House at Secret Garden, which has taken  a serious downturn into mediocrity the last couple times I visited.   Each year I spend March in Phoenix, and I've long wanted to try Quiessence. This year I stayed at the Legacy Golf Resort just next door to the Farm . . .so I had no excuse, and I have not been disappointed.  After reading several reviews here, I decided to wait until I'd visited a few times to offer my opinions. I must say that the experience, from food to service to creativity and ambiance, have been spectacular.  I now have had four meals at Quiessence, and the staff has made me feel very much at home. Each time I've had the vegetable plate 'From the Ground,' and each time it's been a different combination of flavors and textures straight from the garden, plated beautifully to the point of taking out the IPhone for a photo before devouring. The pasta dishes are worth pointing out...they change almost daily, and they've always been creative and delicious. Also, don't shy from the duck egg preparations. Last week an egg-en-cocotte was divine, and last night's soft scrambled duck egg with black truffles was plate-lickingly good.  The staff has shockingly turned me on to Arizona wines, something I would never have ventured into blindly. The Sand Reckoner 7 was so good that I found some at a local store to take East with me to offer up as a ringer in an upcoming blind syrah tasting in New Jersey. Call in advance to secure a table in the main room or outside...the back room is not nearly as romantic. Once I sat alone at the community table overlooking the bar, which was fine for that occasion, as I got to know another couple and we had a delightful time together. Yes, it's expensive, and if you're looking for a slab of grilled meat or chunk of lasagna, don't waste your time or money. But if you appreciate a singularly romantic setting, perfect service, culinary creativity and fresh preparation, you won't be disappointed. Each visit has brought a smile to my face and a yearning to return.",

I know there is timing in the kitchen, but, we just wanted to have a cocktail. So, we sat by a fire and waited probably 15 minutes for drink service which I asked for twice. The menu was limited to a tasting menu. Which was fine except every choice had meat. We  asked for vegetarian/fish options which were accommodated.    We ordered the  Rose , which came out fizzy. And the server tried to defend the fizz. This was not a sparkling wine. It was returned and taken off the bill.The courses were very small, with long stretches of time in between. I figured it was punishment for the fizzy wine return.The fish was good but came out tepid and about 30 minutes after the last dish. The black eyed peas and poached tomatoes under the fish were gross and bitter. The wait staff forgot what was in the dish while they were describing it. The cannoli dessert was fair. But, you better like apples. I think the restaurant is pretentious and dependent on the atmosphere. I have lived here for 45 years and can think of way better places to spend that kind of money. This is not the first time that similar things have happened. We were hoping that it was an off night. Now we see it's an unfortunate pattern.  Last night was the last night!",

Quissence is an intimate, unique space with attentive service and delicious meals.  Let's start with the positives.    1) Ambiance: we made a reservation for 8:15 PM and were seated quickly.  Neither the indoor nor outdoor area were overcrowded, providing for a peaceful dinner. 2) Food: fresh, farm-to-table yet upscale dining experience.  Seriously, made from scratch, balanced courses that are beautifully plated.  (Highly recommended: pistachio soup, both the duck and trout, and the bread pudding)  3) Added touches for the special day: multiple complimentary baskets of focaccia, red sparkling wine at the start of the meal, a heart shaped waffle appetizer, and blood orange macaroons at the end.  We loved the small surprises throughout the meal.  10/10 would dine again.  One negative: It'll put a pretty big dent in the wallet (comparatively to other similar dining experiences) so save for SPECIAL occasions.",

The ambience is quite nice and the seating gives a great view.  The only problem that I noticed was in the serving of the courses.  The waiter that brought the items spoke so softly that most of the time I had no idea what he brought out. The second thing was the wine pairing. In six courses the only red wine served was on the fourth course with the duck confit. Then it was back to whites. First time I have gone from red wine to white as the meal progressed. Lastly, it was that the wine pairings came out far to long after the food was served. In one or two instances the food was just a bite and the wine came out 10 minutes afterwards. That needs to be fixed.  Overall, the Restraunt deserves a 4 in my book.",

We went with a group of 12 on a Wednesday evening. It was a leisurely meal that started with handcrafted cocktails and an array of starters. The restaurant offers 5 and 6 course dinners with wine pairing, but our table opted the share a number of starters and order off the menu. The menu changes depending on the ingredients available.   The Artisan bread basket was delicious and the herbs and balsamic made each bite special. The Meat Shop pork belly was out of this world. It does come with peanuts so beware if anyone at your table has a food allergy.  The Aged beef carpaccio had excellent flavor.   I had the Kohlrabi soup with poached egg. The egg was perfectly cooked. The chicken stock was a little bland and could have used a touch if salt (a universal comment at our table). The people who ordered salads were thrilled with their plates.   For the main course, some ordered scallops and steak, while others opted for pasta dishes. I had the potato gnocchi, which was divine. The gnocchi were soft and delicious! I also tried a scallop and it was quite delicious, as was the aged New York strip.   Dessert did not disappoint. I ate a delicious bread pudding. The churro dessert was beautifully presented and fully eaten by everyone who ordered it. The sherbet was plated splendidly and was enjoyed.",

    "text": "3.5 stars. This is a very unique experience, potentially one of the most unique to be found in Phoenix area. The farm fresh produce, the ambiance of a little farm house and tons of bunnies running around invokes a sense of hunger that is guaranteed to result in a very substantial bill. The meal was tasty and menu rotates all the time. A couple dishes were a little heavy on the salt, but otherwise were some creative and interesting combinations that were very enjoyable. Some other things about this place do not correspond to the prices, thus I suspect is the reason for lower than expected yelp ratings. For example, they pour beers into the kind of glasses one would find at a pub or on a shelf of a dollar general. Even the beers that should have proper glassware for the style. There is a time and a place for everything, but surely not at an establishment where one is spending $$$$ on a meal.  The interior of the house with terra-cotta tiles is very basic, also a bit boring I'd say. The middle room is the worst, there is no design and it felt like the interior was slapped together by whatever furniture and materials were laying around \"the farm\". The interior design, or lack of it, does take away from the experience. It is cheap, while the menu is not at all. Perhaps some will find the charm in the house being untouched, so it may be a matter of preference. If the weather allows and they have it open, I'd recommend outdoor seating instead.  After dinner, walking through the grounds is a must. Surrounded by large trees, there is a feeling that you are no longer in the desert and there is a sense of being in a magical forest. It is a spot for romantics. I could see spending an evening here painting and finishing it wish a wonderful meal.",

We spent about 3 1/2 hours at the restaurant the other evening; which we were expecting.  The problem with that is that we were seated in the sunroom area, which had very little airflow, and was EXTREMELY hot.  My husband and myself had to fan ourselves the entire dinner.  I understand it is an older building, but if we had been warned prior to our reservations that the main \"house\" dining area was not available, we would have rescheduled our reservations for another date.  Our server was very friendly, and knew the menu.  We chose the six-course tasting menu with wine pairing addition.  Our courses were mixed up midway through as well as the wine pairing; (we received meals in the incorrect order, and incorrect wine pairing with the meals).

Our party of 7 enjoyed appetizers of carefully prepared chef's board, cauliflower with lamb heart, beet salad with blue cheese, foraged mixed vegetables and raw kampachi on a salt block. For dinner our table ordered the aged New York strip cooked to order, the sturgeon and the crisp house made gnocchi. To finish the evening we got one dessert and it was the their wonderful bread pudding with vanilla ice cream. Any description does not do the food justice so I will leave it at that.   The drinks were equally as delicious. Their margarita was the best margarita I have ever had. The wine was carefully selected and very much pleased the wine drinkers at the table.   Each dish was prepared and presented with care and every bite was harmoniously balanced both in flavor and in texture. It was, in a word, exquisite.   Our waiter, Robby, was friendly, knowledgeable and had great wine recommendations.  Good food with fresh ingredients takes time so be prepared to have your meal last a couple (or four) hours. Although, I found it refreshing to spend time catching up with old and new friends.   Quiessence is a restaurant where quality outweighs quantity. While portions are European and prices are high, the food is absolutely worth every penny.   So sit back, enjoy the night and let your taste buds enjoy a delightful meal.",

Being there on a  Sunday for brunch there was a wait, but the staff directed you to a choice of many drinks that were self  service while you wait. Coffee, OJ and water- they even had mimosas waiting for those interested.   On a side note, you will be so lucky if you get Barbie as your server! She rocks it and makes a mean bloody mary!   All and all with the beautiful surroundings and fresh food I would recommend this to everyone!",

    "text": "Celebrating a couple late birthdays brought us to this quaint little restaurant tucked away at the back of The Farm at South Mountain. I've been to a few weddings here but last night was the first time to actually dine at Quiessence Restaurant. It's an interesting name because the word \"quiescence\" refers to a period of dormancy or inactivity, so I'm not sure if the names have anything in common or just coincidence.   This restaurant is anything but dormant. It is warm, inviting, and perhaps even romantic if you wish it to be. The Saltillo tile floors add depth to this home and we were seated right next to the original door and fireplace of this historic abode.   The 6 course tasting menu with the wine pairings allowed the four of us to fully indulge in the experience at The Farm. The 2 1/2 hour experience allowed us to get plenty of conversation in along with giving us time to digest between courses. We almost couldn't keep up with all the wine pairings since there was such food variety brought before us. With the chef selection, we did not all receive the same menu items so we were able to sample a bit of everything the menu had to offer!   Chef's Board - our favorite diversion! Pineapple crisps wedged into rich goat cheese, persimmon fruit roll ups, pate, stuffed olives, onion slices stabbing mustard seeds, wavy round thin pork slices with homemade jam - the varying textures and combinations of flavors was a treat   Shrimp soup - simple battered Mexican shrimp bathed in a creamy soup. The shrimp was large and dense but in a good way  Beef carpaccio- just as described but served on unique thin toast that was curled not tough like biscotti but perfectly done toast. Really liked this one!  Cavaletti pasta - rich and served with what I think was tender beef (it was a little hard to hear our waitress due to the table next to us being a little loud). You really can't go wrong with pasta and meat..  Steelhead trout (what I had) OR Aged New York Strip in Chimchurri.   The trout was delicate but had the density and color of salmon since it was wild steelhead trout. Served with a potato creme fraische.  The New York Strip was cooked to perfection and definitely was paired well with the chimchurri sauce.  Bread pudding with vanilla ice cream OR panna cotta? - since the steelhead was a lighter entree, the bread pudding followed it. It was phenomenal! My favorite part of all 6 courses. The steak was followed by the panna dessert which was good but the bread pudding was waaaaaay better.",

After delicious starters of fresh salad and soup, we were disappointed with the main entrees. My husband ordered the pork tenderloin -no complaints. However, my scallops were so over salted, they were non edible. The only other entree choice was chicken (I don't eat pork). Chicken was ok, but I never order chicken out, especially paying $40!  Good service, but we won't be back.",

Our overall opinion was that the food was either a little too salty and or a little bland (most dishes). The fish (marlin) cooked to perfection, the butter nut squash great flavor and mushroom soup tasted like a packet soup - so some dishes really nice, but others either bland or over salted.  The young lady serving us, although very attentive tended to be a little too serious. A little smile or joke might have been in order.  We were never rushed and spent 2- 3 hours just chatting - setting was wonderful so high marks for the ambiance.   Just a pity the food did not match ambiance etc. I guess I'm spoiled by my wife's cooking.  8/18 update - perhaps I was a little harsh the first time-around. Second visit to the restaurant - food and ambiance excellent. Great way to spend several hours with friends",

The food was overall good, but I wasnt THAT impressed. Our waiter was knowledgable but a little thrown off as he was training some young gal that appeared to have never waitressed before-  He seemed irritated. We started with the charcuterie plate...it was ok, but headcheese on toast points and pickled onions wasnt my cup pf tea. My friend ordered a salad but it never came and our waiter suggested it would have been too much food anyway, lol!  I had roasted squab with carrot puree and my friend had beet ravioli. Both were good,nothing special.  The goatcheese & pear tart was delicious, the chocolate cake/beet mousse was not. The front sunroom part of this restaurant, although has a nice window view, was very loud.  Love the idea of a fresh daily menu and perhaps we arrived on an \"off\" day...but for $250 (2), I expected more.",

    "text": "Don't give thanks here. It's been a while since I've posted, but for anyone who can't remember,  see my motto above. And I get even more pissed when it's expensive bad food!   So imagine my mood when we left Quiessence yesterday having dropped $171 for 2, (including tax & tip), on a meal that  was certainly worse than what I could make at home. I had the Date & Beet Salad, the Turkey entree, and the Apple Crisp for dessert. Served family style were, greens, Sausage & Onion stuffing, Roasted Carrots & Parsnips, Mashed Potatoes, and a bread basket.  I'll start from the beginning with the salad which was OK. Not what you'd expect for the price, but acceptable. The turkey was brined in an over salted liquid with something odd added. It was moist, but I still left slices on my plate the flavor was so odd.  The stuffing had very little flavor at all & was dry. The sausage added nothing but meat so  that the vegetarians couldn't eat it. The mashed potatoes were also over salted. The carrots & parsnips were severely undercooked. Hard as rocks. Or maybe they were overcooked & dehydrated, since a few of them were mush. The greens were good. All of the side dishes were left over. There were 3 kinds of bread in the basket; a dry foccacia, corn bread, & a soaked, with oil or butter, corn bread. They all seemed like they were from the previous day, & someone had tried to save them.  We all had the Apple Crisp with Cranberry Ice Cream for dessert. It was also OK.  The Crisp was good, but needed lemon juice to cut the sweetness. The ice cream was an Iron Chef moment.  Not a good one. I removed as much as I could & poured a little cream, supplied for the coffee, on my crisp. Oh, for some vanilla Hagen-Dazs!  We were tired of counting pennies, and thought we'd splurge. We'd all been to Quiessence before, when there was a different chef. It's a lovely location, but not enough to make up for the food.  On the day that I usually give thanks for the bounty of life,  I started planning Thanksgiving dinner for next year.",

    "text": "I dragged the manfriend here so that we could get a bit of the \"country\" experience in Phoenix, so this review is based off of only one visit (please keep that in mind!!).  It was a bit of a drive from our hotel, but felt like stepping into another world, my perfect dream land of a gentlewoman's farm, where the faint whiff of pony poop does not imply that I will have to clean it up, where the sage and the stars and the dust conspire to make you hungry for a big dinner of country food.  What I most liked about Quiessence was that it was country food the way I would want to live in the country.  Less biscuits and fried stuff, more fruit of the land.  +1 Star - Atmosphere.  Its sexy sexy sexy here.  More or less.  The fire pit on the way up the walkway (a walk lined with flowering vines, lush plants and the like) was so inviting.  The dining space was a tad over-lit, and you know how we ladies like our flattering lighting. + 1 Star - Organized staff.  They had my reservation all squared away and they had saved a nice table for us, even though we were 15 minutes late (being Spanish, that means on time to me). We were swiftly attended to, but never felt rushed. - 1 Star - Beers and wines by the glass.  Not quite as much selection as we would have liked, even though the list is not meager.  Quality was good.  I would like to see more than one sparkling by the glass and a few more up-market selections by the glass.  They have an excellent list by the bottle, though. + 1 Star - Food sourcing.  Its one thing to serve good food, which I demand (!).  It's another to care about where that food came from.  I can't recall exactly what we had (I had found some wine I liked!), but some of the standouts were the vegetables that came from the property that were a part of each dish.  + 1 Star - Menu.  We did the tasting menu ($65 a head) which was an alternative to ordering ala carte.  I was thrilled with my salad.  It was probably the best I have had in... forever?  He loved his entree, lamb with vegetables.  He looked at his place setting after finishing and commented that he had not used his knife!  Lamb was like butter! - 1 Star - Dessert.  Talk about a let down.  He had a white tiramisu that was okay, but not great.  I had pears on a shortbread cookie.  Not good at all.  The cookie was inedible.  These guys need a pastry chef. + 1 Star - Romance.  It was so romantic here that we were inspired to go make out in the bathroom for a while. Should have seen the looks on people's faces.  Geez.  Prudes.  But it is one of the most bodice-ripping inspiring places I have been in a short while.   - 1 Star - Pricing.  Overall, $65 per head is not outrageous, but seems high for what was received.  I was not blown away by my entree - a poached egg with veggies.  Really?  Not so much.  I am torn whenever writing reviews if I should be rating them (via the yelp star system) against their potential or against the overall establishments in the world or if I should rate them against those in their home town.  I feel very conflicted about rating Quiessence only 4 stars, as I believe it is likely one of the best that Phoenix/Scottsdale has to offer.  However, I would like to see them improve their desserts and also pay a bit more attention to lavishing on the guests (for example, it was a cold night, but they could have up-sold he and I to a drink by the fire pit outside if they had offered blankets or the like) before I give them 5 stars.    These guys need to be a little less precious in my view, keep their focus on the local sourcing, and get away from the overly fluffy presentation.  I liked this place very much and will try them again in the future, perhaps for their beautifully presented brunch, whiff of animal dung coddling my nostrils on a fair weather day.",

    "text": "Quiessence is, simply put, beautiful.  Full windows and earthy wooden walls give a feeling of warmth inside this restaurant perched in the middle of a farm.  The restaurant seemed fairly full even on a Tuesday evening; we had secured reservations just a couple days before.  My friend and I had sampled sandwiches at the Farm Kitchen earlier that week, and were impressed enough to want to eat at the restaurant.  The crisp, fresh veggies didn't disappoint: we ordered the salad with orange and grapefruit slices and the crudites to start.  Both were very good; I didn't even know how much I liked raw radishes and turnips until I tried them with their pesto and aioli sauces.  For entrees, I ordered the lamb and my friend ordered the pork shoulder.  Service started out very good, but trailed off quickly.  Waiting for our food took a very long time (a couple seated after us received and finished their entrees before we received our's), and no one bothered to explain the situation until the maitre'd apologized almost 45 minutes later.  Apparently the chef was unhappy with the sauce on my entree, so he started anew.  This isn't really a problem, but they should have communicated this to us earlier.  For our troubles, they comped me the glass of wine I ordered, but they forgot to bring out with my entree  as I had requested.  Also, they didn't offer us bread, but I will echo the lady who whispered this to us on her way out: ask for the bread.  We received warm foccacia, apple walnut, and pomegranate slices of wonder with honey and butter.  YUM.  The entrees were both solid, but didn't quite live up to the innovation and freshness of the vegetables.  My lamb's sauce was delicious, but the meat was tough.  Maybe the vegetarian entrees are the way to go?  But our dessert, the gingerbread pear cake, was yet another winner.  If the entrees were tad more inspired, or the service weren't so spotty, this place definitely would have warranted five stars.  If I return, I'd like to try the 75$ tasting menu.  Our bill came out to about 100$ for two people, including tip, no drinks.",

    "text": "Decided to try out Quiessence for my Wife's Birthday last night.  We really enjoyed the Farm's breakfast restaurant Morning Glory Cafe and we were told that Quiessence was a must try.  I made our reservation for 8:15 PM and when we arrived we waited ten minutes for our table to be prepared, and the hostess seemed confused.  We ended up sitting outside in the gravel which was not too bad beings they have flowers and Christmas lights all over.  As we were seated at a table that had no candle, and was extremely wobbly.  Our server fixed these minor issues, but in the process told us \"the Chef said he is only doing the tasting menu if you order it right now\".  We were shocked that we had not even seen the menu, ordered drinks, or had a chance to settle in before we were being forced to make a decision.  My Wife began crying and we ended up walking out.  A Birthday dinner was quickly ruined, because \"the Chef had a large order coming in\"...   I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  The sad part is they had my phone number from making the reservation and I was not even given a phone call to ask if they could fix it.",

I can't remember the courses but everything was delightful - very unique and local. I used to work nearby and went to the farm often. With a new job I've lost time and am not in the area as much and pretty much forgot about it.  It's defintiely a hidden treasure and I plan on making a reservation soon!",

Fresh local food transformed into the most delicious meals by an amazing chef.    If you are looking for the most romantic setting, or the best Phoenix food, or amazing service, or some combo of the above, please check out this restaurant.  You will be amazed!  I HIGHLY recommend the Farmers Feast with wine pairings.  And if you haven't been to the Farm, come a little early and wander around the Farm and check out the chickens and flowers and lovely pecan trees.",

    "text": "It's been nearly  9 months  since the wife and myself ate at Quiescence on a Friday evening.  It takes an evening to really go through the experience and that's the best way to explain it because objectively this has to add up to more than the sum of it's parts.   The grounds are great and a nice transition from the orange vampire lights of Phoenix but it's likely If you ride a bike it's pretty bloody perilous to get your stand down,or to wear high heels ( Hey those Harley guys are hiding something;) )   I have a rural background, and the outside tier of Quiessence , the one just in the main entrance,really didn't hack it in terms of ambiance, it's like sitting in my UK farmhouse at night :  ( Ok that may be exactly the point they are going for but I kinda feel that we missed out by not being in the main room)    So what of the food?  I have to concur with many that have said that the natural ingredients, the  meats, cheeses , presentation and knowledge of the staff are excellent though  possibly a tad presumptive re what my next question would have been.  We cook a  lot at home but it's not possible for me to know every herb that goes on a plate I like to learn but preempting my ignorance?    The salad was probably the best one I've ever had which when considered next to my chosen second plate of Duo of Housemade \"Boudin Blanc\" Sausage and Slow Roasted Pork Belly with Butternut Squash \"Mash\" should  be a good indicator of how I rank salad in the scheme of things.Their wild foraged mushroom salad  was, well it's 9 months later and I still, recall it fondly.    We'll certainly go back but it's more of an annual event. Quiescence is  like getting your first real watch. It  kicks you off into a search for ever more interesting pieces but you still end up having a soft spot for the original.   4.25 stars if I could rate it like that.  Just a little too high on the price for what goes into the main dish. The appetizers, plate one, salad were all worth it in a way that our entrees were not. Given that we'd just had great appetizer, beginning and first plate it was anti-climactic for the entree to be ,you know, just great.  (Yeah I know ungrateful , there's people starving in the world ,we were two of them in the interim between plate 1 and 2 :) )   A small  frustration was the water. The mineral water gets up to room temperature between courses and at $9 a bottle ,a mark-up that makes me want to switch to wine next time, the Pillsbury Roan red, and  take a cab.",

I thought that was pretty cool but that's about all that was cool about the place, oh and the wine selection was very good.   I'll keep this short and simple: way too overpriced for what you get. No major complaints about food but service was just ok, food portions were tiny (which isn't all bad because that's why most of us are fat), but $300 for two people?!   And the 18% automatic gratuity is stupid. Also, there were no towels in the bathroom to dry my hands. I told my server this as a courtesy and she replied, \"oh they temporarily removed the basket of towels\". Huh? And this person is automatically getting an 18% tip?",

    "text": "We went here for a special Valentines day dinner and it was PERFECT!   About 3 weeks before we started brainstorming ideas for a romantic and delicious spot and came across Quiessence as one of Phoenix's top 5 romantic restaurants so we thought we would look into it. They set up 3 seating tines 5, 7, and 9pm. Both the 7:00 and 9:00 times were full when we called (3 weeks prior) so we figured it would be amazing and took the 5:00 reservation.   What I love about Quiessence is that you totally feel like you have left Phoenix/Scottsdale. This is NOT in a strip mall and it does NOT have vallet. We parked and had to walk pretty far to reach the restaurant and actually walked through a wedding reception. When we sat down, we also noticed that the people dining around us all looked like they had real parts (unlike many Scottsdale restaurants) and seemed to be having just as great of a time as we were.   Our table was fantastic-nestled in the back corner with a perfect view of the back yard complete with fire places. Our meal was unreal. The Valentine menu included 4 courses all of which were decedent. We went with the wine pairing for each course and couldn't have made a better choice. I had an unbelievable salad with blood oranges and pistachio nuts dressed with a light vinaigrette. The combination of flavors and textures was so well thought, I could have had another serving and been happy forever. For my entree I enjoyed scallops served with pearl onions served over risotto. Once again the flavors were surreal. Our dessert was adorable and served on a large wooden block. We each had mini cups of hot chocolate with chocolate chip cookies, lemon bars and a variety of truffles.   I couldn't have picked a better place to enjoy a romantic meal with my special valentine.  Great job Quiessence!  I cannot wait to return",

We tried the tasting menu, which is comprised of six courses. The first four were outstanding, and the pace was perfect. Then we waited for the entrees. And waited. And waited. Staff disappeared and didn't communicate anything about the delay. The table next to us asked for the manager and tapped out of their meal because they had to make their flight. The entrees finally arrived, both of which were overcooked. After 3 1/2 hours into our meal, we gave up and asked to have our dessert to go. Staff explained that they weren't expecting such a crowd (there were probably a dozen empty tables), and that this was their \"practice run\" before Valentine's Day. Ready or not, for these prices, there really is no room for an amateur performance.",

Set back in the Farm at South Mountain, my girlfriend and I dined outside and it felt like we had made a weekend trip out to Napa.  We even heard a pack of coyotes \"yelping\" towards the end of our night - it was a really wonderful experience.  As far as food goes, we tried the \"Farmer's Feast\" - a chef selected tasting menu w/ a wine course - and the ingredients were extremely fresh and every course tasted better than the previous.  The menu is seasonal and is constantly changing; but the pate, and halibut with pancetta stuck out above the rest.  Each wine was paired perfectly for each course.  This place is expensive, but you get what you pay for.  Highly Recommended.",

    "text": "Quiessence's ambience, a large reason why our dinner this past weekend one of the most memorable I've had in years, draws greatly from the house from which the restaurant operates.  Nestled off of 32nd street on South Mountain, the restaurant is the new tenant of what was once the home of Dwight and Maie Heard.  Arizona is young by comparison to most states, but the culture and history are far richer than its age would imply thanks to such extraordinary citizens like the Heards.  Chiefly known for their museum endowment to the City of Phoenix, the two were a Power Couple before such a term existed.  One could argue that Maie's contributions to the state outshine those of her newspaper / cattleman husband, a feat in and of itself because of the times in which she lived.  In the early 1900's, she was a driving force behind the YWCA, Arizona Red Cross, Little Theatre, Woman's Club, Phoenix Art Assocation, and the founder of the Social Service Center.    The staff and presentation were excellent, our server Robby deftly handled my 9 year old son's palate trepidations with ease.  The menu was a refreshing surprise worthy of its own review.  I recommend the crudo and ny strip, but you really can't go wrong, as everything we ordered was fantastic.    Thanks for a wonderful evening.  We'll be back soon!",

    "text": "Quiessence Pros: Amazing and inventive food.  Fresh flavors from a combination of unique and everyday ingredients. Portion sizes are perfect and food was served at the absolutely correct temperature.  Highly recommend the Chef's Tasting Menu.  Wine list heavily features local/Arizona wines.  Servers are very well versed in their menus and friendly. Interestingly, men and women are served some different food/wine during the tasting.  Take advantage of your server's knowledge and communicate any likes/dislikes regarding food/flavors.     Cons: Pacing is ridiculously slow.  Plodding even.  Our six course tasting took just over 3 1/2 hours.  After the plates from our 4th course (an amazing pasta!) were cleared, our server brought out the wine pairings for the 5th course, then 45 minutes later the fifth course arrived. Needless to say, the wine was gone. That said, even with the extremely slow pacing, the food was worth the visit and we will come again.  I am hoping that our slow service was an anomaly since the table across from us sat down 1/2 an hour later, ordered the same tasting menu, and finished 30 minutes before us.  With the faster pacing, the tasting menu takes a more reasonable 2 1/2 hours.   Bottom line - the food is excellent but, be prepared to make an event of the night. Do not make plans that can't be broken to be anywhere after dinner.",

The location is a bit off the beaten path, driving through the city I couldn't believe there was a farm nearby. It being a farm there were some bugs buzzing around. It was a great atmosphere and the pricing was appropriate.   We had a reservation and were promptly seated upon arrival. The service was good, attentive but not overbearing. On addition the servers were knowledgeable about the dishes which was great.   Overall the food was good, the tasting menu had the perfect amount of courses. The two standout dishes (best and worst)  were beet ravioli and the dessert: chocolate fondant cake. The ravioli was my least favorite. The flavor was just off, I was excited about it because I love beets, but it didn't work. The dessert in contrast was amazing. Perfect way to end the meal. The cake was cooked to perfection and the ice cream was a great highlight on the plate.   Overall I'd return here. It wasn't the best meal I've ever had, but I'd say top 30.",

    "text": "Quiessence has been a favorite for the better part of the last year, mostly supported by the superb service provided by Brook. We've eaten here with both large and small parties, enjoying the atmosphere and a somewhat refined attempt at farm to table dining. Alas, Brook has now left and we are left to the devices of the kitchen that seems off its game and a wait staff that lacks both in warmth and proficiency. That said, I'll speak for myself for the remainder of this post and let the remainder of my party vote on their own.  Our most recent dinner was the worst meal we've eaten here, and seems to be part of a continuing decline of the establishment. While the food has always veered to the side of too salty, the whole meal lacked proper seasoning - either too heavy or too light to be enjoyable.  We started with the charcuterie, which was very nice. The chicken pate was excellent and the headcheese was a delightful surprise. The aged gouda was also delightful, with a nice bit of bite. The downfall was a set of crostini that were so heavy in salt and garlic that they overwhelmed the items placed on top of them.  Drinks arrived at this time and the manhattan was very nice. That said, the house specialties were a huckleberry highball that lacked flavor and a take on a French 75 that was so bitter it couldn't be consumed. Honestly, aside from the champagne, I'm not sure how the drink even qualified as a French 75? I will take a moment, however, to note that the wine selection here is excellent. The staff knows their bottles and we are always pleased.  Next came a kabocha squash soup course that was truly underwhelming. The soup itself was the consistency and flavoring of a pre-packed Trader Joe's product. Being a fan of the Japanese pumpkin, I was hoping for something really special here and it failed. The one highlight was the inclusion of a razz cherry that proposed a nice complement.   Moving on, we had a round of appetizers. The smoked duck breast with brussel sprout has and poached duck egg was over salted and the overwhelmed by the duck egg. A highlight was the lobster mushroom pasta, which had a delightful flavor. I would suggest it. The more traditional salads were very nice.  On to entrees. I cannot lie, this entire course was a terrible miss. I ordered some goat that was entirely inedible. I've only had goat in more ethnic preparations and was interested to see what was going to be plated. It was salty, stringy, fatty, and I could not eat it. The white beans served on the side were nice, and the mash next to it was unremarkable.   The opah that was plated was also a serious miss. It was salted to the point of being inedible and the texture was off. I've known this to be a more delicate flavor that I experienced last night and I question the freshness of the product.   We also tried a gnocchi as part of this course, which was on par with something i'd expect from an Olive Garden. The flavors were terribly heavy and the texture of the sauce was 'goopey.\"   We finished with a desert course, Honestly, at this point the table was so exhausted that we weren't sure we even wanted to sit for the course. It was a delightful surprise. The bread pudding was exceptional. The deconstructed s'more was fun and delightful. This was the highlight of the meal and we closed on a light note.   In short, for the price I expect more and am disappointed by the trend I'm seeing. I hope to see the service warm again and the kitchen come back to what we initially experienced. For the money, I'd send you to Kai.",

They even brought us celebratory champagne and dessert with a happy anniversary message.  The best part was that the food was pretty amazing.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went to Quiessence to celebrate Valentine's Day. From the minute we got to the hostess stand there were issues. The hostess asked my boyfriend if the reservation was made through Opentable because they might not be able to honor the reservation... Our reservation was confirmed by Opentable for 8pm. Come 9pm, we finally were seating inside where it was uncomfortably warm. I requested to move outside to an visibly available open table. It took about 15 minutes to be moved. Once we were moved, the server was friendly and apologized for the delay. Since it was a set menu the selection process was simple. The issue was the main course option was either hen or gnocchi. My boyfriend and I both wanted the hen and we were informed we didn't have the option, both come out and we have to share. I pushed the matter slightly because we shouldn't be forced into something both of us didn't want, especially because that is not what is stated on the menu. The chef agreed to prepare two hen meals. The apple soup was quite good but the octopus and the risotto balls were very salty. When the main course was delivered to the table, it was a gnocchi and a hen. I heard the sever state to the hostess that this was an error and should not have been delivered. The sever stopped by to let us know the chef wanted us to \"try\" the gnocchi but another hen would be out. The hen was salty and filled with bones, not a very cute meal for Valentine's Day. By the time the other hen came out, we were done with dinner. The dessert was good but at this point, it was already 10:45.  I frequent Morning Glory and have never been disappointed. My boyfriend feels horribly that the night was such a disaster. It isn't even worth giving this place a second chance based on the price of the food and the horrible experience.

    "text": "I wouldn't say this is exactly my kind of place, the food was good enough to give it four stars but the somber, overly important atmosphere rendered this place 3 stars from me.  If you've ever seen Portlandia with the episode where the diners have to know about the chicken's life before they eat it, this is a version of that.  There is a full description of each vegetable's existence before being placed on your plate.  It also was a bit of the \"I will have to speak with chef to see if chef will allow you to have olive oil on the table.\" mindset.  Ok, those are the negatives.  The positives are that the food really was delicious.  I loved the creamy Oregon blue cheese dressing with my beets.  In fact we all really enjoyed our meals.  My New York steak was very tasty but a little too clean, too free of oil/grease that is so wonderful with a nice steak.  Dessert as well was really yummy.  We also loved one of our waiters who was so kind to speak with us about Arizona wines that I assumed were all atrocious and he corrected me on that.  Our other waiter that evening was a bit too cold and snobbish.  Therefore, if you fancy yourself a gourmand, you gain nutrition from the spirituality of the cosmos and you catch flies alive in your house and gently free them outside while whispering, \"Fly little creature fly\" then this is your place.  If, instead, you like to scream at the Minnesota Vikings for losing another idiotic game to the Bears while chomping on the finest ingredient filled delectable pizza then this is not your game.",

I believe all of us ended up getting the Tasting  Menu (at $85 each) as they were not intended to share and we didn't want to miss out on the experience. IMHO, the many small portions were perfect in size but too much in total quantity for one person. Each dish was created and balanced to perfection, revealing a new discovery of flavors and textures. Will def come back again for special occasions! And perhaps share a Tasting Menu so I don't feel bad in the end about the expense. Maybe it was just because it was a monthly fun event not a special one-time or annual occasion. Nonetheless, we loved the moment!",

    "text": "We took a chance for our Valentine's dinner and although we had fun we were a little disappointed. They had a set menu for the holiday and an optional wine pairing. We loved the idea of a farm-to-table meal. We have been getting the Chow Locally farm boxes and were excited for some creativity and inspiration.   The restaurant was hard to find in the dark and we almost inadvertently crashed a wedding. A few strategic landscaping lights would have helped. When we approached the hostess station, we were five minutes early and the hostess made a comment about us being early, the waitress having another table and we might not be taken care of right away. Then she greeted the people standing behind us who were meeting another couple. For a moment, it appeared as though she was going to seat the four of us together but another staff member cleared up the confusion and told us our waitress was able to handle us.   We were seated in the back room adjacent to the patio. It smelled kind of mildewy like a cottage or cabin and the windows were dirty with tape residue on them. There were no fresh flowers on the table which seemed like a no brainer for a farm at Valentine's Day. We also saw no use of potted herbs or produce in the decor such as what True Foods does. (This may seem nit picky but for the price of this meal, details are important.) Overall, the decor was mediocre not what you'd expect for a $300 meal for two.  We chose opposite options for each of the 3 courses and I added the wine pairings which were delicious. I appreciated the deeper pours I got compared to the table next to us. The food was really good but not over the top. We were expecting T. Cooks or Binkley's quality and creativity but Quiessence fell short. They missed on service details as well such as giving us each other's courses every single time, not combing the crumbs off the table and not replacing cleared flat wear we still needed. With a surprise \"house rule\" 20% gratuity at the end, we were a little salty about the service experience.   We see potential but Quiessence should take a look at the competition.",

    "text": "Quiessence at the Farm My wife and I share the same birthday, which is good for me, as I don't have to try to remember when it is. I have done a tasting or sampling menu before and wanted to do this again for my wife's birthday.  What a nice place to eat. I made a call in the morning to check on the reservation and dress code in any. Dress code basically is business casual. Nice pair of pants and sports shirt and you are fine. I told them it was our birthday and we wanted a quite place to sit and talk. The person on the phone suggested the patio. This would be outside and since the reservation was for 6:00pm and it has been a warm week in Phoenix, I felt it would be fine, and it was a great choice. Hope you noticed I patted my self on the back. I will need that soon.  We were met by our waiter James and shown to our table. We were at least 12 feet from the next occupied table. They may of heard us talking but I never knew they were there.  James was an excellent waiter. Enough contact but did not over do it as it happens at times. The servers that brought the food made the experience special. They told us what we were getting, how it was prepared and suggestions on how it might be enjoyed. I wish I knew their names, they are to be commended. Both of enjoyed our 2 hour meal, with plenty of time to talk between courses.  I will definitely be back to see them.  Now I need to rate myself. I have to give myself 2 stars. One reason I chose this restaurant was because they had a tasting menu and wanted my wife to have this experience. I am AADD and when I get something in my mind I just forge ahead blindly. My mistake was I had not read the tasting menu. If I had I would of noticed the raw fish and oysters. I am fine with raw fish and oysters but my wife is not. This meant there was one course she did not get to participate. It was her birthday also. She was so good about this and did not say anything except enjoy these are yours. We did have a delightful night eating and talking. Something I would enjoy again.....but first I would read the menu! There was 6 full courses to the meal with of a total of 19 different items to taste. I many of missed counting an item or two. With the exception of the amuse-bouche there was plenty of each item for both of us to have a good taste.  We had a wonderful night and I do not hesitate to recommend Quiessence.",

Their \"wine bar\" is really just a long table you sit at for a bit before your table is ready, and its a bit awkward if you are there with others, feels sort of like you just joined a dinner party with people you don't know. The food was decent, you can tell the ingredients were fresh and definitely a lot of effort went into the preparation, but overall it just didn't do it for me, with a lot of dishes lacking in flavor.  You'll easily pay $250+ for a nice memorable dinner, and it was a nice experience, but it's a steep price to warrant a return trip for food and portions that leave a lot to be desired.",

Parking is in a dirt lot and you walk on a uneven cobble walkway to the entrance. Its a cute restaurant remodled from a farm house just dont wear heels. I had to take mine off to avoid damaging them walking in. The staff started out friendly, we got drinks and went over the menu. The food options are very limited so if your picky, vegetarian or have food allergies don't waste your time, we were told the chef would not alter his recipes so pick something else. They do not have a kid menu either so again probably dont bring them, my second mistake. Once we got our orders in we didnt see the waitress for 40 min, we were thirsty and getting very hungry. When she did come around she seemed annoyed at the bother. Our first course took almost 2 hrs to arrive. The food was subpar and portions were tiny. The waitress pretty much ignored us the rest of the time we were there and they refused to take back a dish that we didnt ordered and told us we would still be charged. All in all it was a very expensive disappointment.",

    "text": "A GREAT \"EXPENSIVE\" MISTAKE!  I am in a mixed emotions writing this review, for the simple fact that, my and my entire family is so addicted to \"The Farm at south mountain\" and we live very close and we love to see this place grow. However, we've always been there for lunch with family and many other occasions & with co-workers however the my first and only (sadly) experience with Quiessence which is the night time restaurant on the same facility. I had recommended to try this place to my boss (from out of town), who has traveled world and is vegetarian since childhood. I was doubtful to try, because the prices on the menu are on the mid to high range. Anyways, we both sat down and had a decent amount of waiting. The table server was very polite. My boss had done her research when she agreed to try this place and she was looking forward to their sampler, which she read was amazing where u get to try few stuff before ordering (normal right!). Server came with a bread basket and had said, he was sorry because he could not offer the sampler due to the reasons he isn't too sure about but he is happy to take the order. It felt so rushed. We mention about diet restriction and he said they can make pasta dish vegetarian. The ordered arrived and dish was Terrible! I think the fact could be either they haven't tried making a plate with Vegetable broth, OR the fact that they're in rush since we sat down. I had ordered a beat salad, which I was working on, however the lady walked by 3 times asking us if we were done! Look at the quantity served and why rush!?? We simply felt so much rush, we decided to pay, leave the decent tip and have lady take our plates. My boss insisted not to say anything and we left. Later, she told me how awkward she felt there and that she was still hungry that we had to again go somewhere to eat after just finishing up 'fancy' dinner at this place and she hoped I'd call and at least tell them the honest feedback. I had taken a time and call 3 times to highlight the issue. First time spoken with a person called \"Allison\" she was nice but in a denial state of mind from beginning on the call. She later took my cell and assured me she will talk to owners and get back with me. Days goes by and no-call (Expected right!!?). I called again, and tried 5 times, but no one picks up! Tried 3rd time to reach to \"sales department\" and had spoken with a lovely person (didn't catch the name), she said someone will call me on my cell and take care of my case. Guess what, its been almost 2 weeks, and haven't heard a thing!  Sad but I had done my part by taking time to reach out to them by many means, but haven't gotten any response. That generally means business DON'T CARE for what customers think! Sad that this is associated with \"Farm\" which is my family's fav place. I had decided to now write this feedback (just to create more awareness), and also talk to my co-workers about it because they rely on my food choices.  My advice -- Please avoid the place altogether. If you absolutely can't, its complete hit or miss. If your experience is great like some of others, then great! But if not, know that you will not be heard or helped!  Feel free to contact me if you want to know my entire experience in detail or share your experiences with this place with me. (480) 818-5529",

I'd already perused through the menu online, and when I saw that the menu had not changed, I knew I'd have the Power Ranches organic beef burger ($14), cooked to medium (was told it would still be pink), with Bravo white cheddar, subbged with plain aioli, Nueske bacon, house made pickles on the side, with house made potato chips with blue cheese fondue.  I decided against having a glass of wine and ordered filtered iced water, instead.  Other reviewers weren't kidding- this is slow food, so be prepared to wait!  If I had company, I'd definitely order an appetizer to help stave off hunger pangs- the artisanal cheese (choice of three) with fruits and nuts sounds delicious!  Will have to try this during snacktime (from 2p to 5p), where apps are slightly discounted ($2 off?).  Entree arrived-  what a beauty! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LMdUoR00jPxQDWLYRq93FA?select=Y_QK_tR_PdaoNoXdHXyR4g#Y_QK_tR_PdaoNoXdHXyR4g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/LMdU...</a>  I immediately had to try a chip!  I did notice that the burger was was not cooked to medium- definitely not slightly reddish, not even slightly pink.  Nevertheless, it was juicy and tender, and just pure delight!  Loved the rustic bread used; the Nueske bacon (thick-cut, and such a treat...  I want to buy some to use at home- does anyone know where I may procure some?  Whole Foods?); and the farm greens and shaved red onion, as well.    Was able to check out the interior on my way to the restroom to wash hands before dining and after... Oh, so charming!  What a great place to dine at while on a retreat here.  Hope to visit again very soon!",

The waiter who served my husband and I talked our ears off through much of our meal, which made the atmosphere seem more casual than before. Also, the waiter didn't seem very knowledgeable on the wine selection, which was also lacking in comparison to pre- chef Dustin.   That being said, I can still appreciate the atmosphere and would like to try some of the other dishes but I miss the delicate flavors and quiet ambience from before.

After we were seated, it was lovely,  the service was great, as each person explained the history of the property and where all of their ingredients are sourced from.  We had the pork belly as an appetizer and it was excellent.  Overall wonderful food, and service, but a little deceiving as you approach the restaurant.",

We'd never been there before and navigating the farm in the dark was a bit of an adventure.   The food, the service, and the ambiance of this restaurant are top notch.  The food was good but a little too foo-foo for me. My parents loved it.",

    "text": "This review could easily have been a 5 Star review...easily...except for SALT.  Just about every dish was extremely over salted.  In fact, the waitress said that she gets that same complaint a lot.  I put this at the top of my review for two reasons...1. I hope the chef reads this and starts to understand that he needs to reduce the salt, and 2. so YOU will make sure to tell the waitress you don't want your food over salted.  Otherwise...WOW what a great restaurant.  The location is on a farm that grows all the vegetables and most of the items you eat in the restaurant.  The atmosphere is cozy, romantic, wonderful.  The service is excellent, and the servers know their stuff!  Your best bet is get the chefs menu with a wine pairing and see what shows up at the table.  There is no better way to eat dinner here.  The presentation was 5*, the variety and freshness of the food was awesome.  I really loved the experience, and will be back.",

    "text": "I had no expectations about this restaurant even though I read the menu and reviews. Never been in Arizona before, I didn't know what to expect. I made reservations for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. We are from Seattle so we are very spoiled  foodies. We were created and sited at this old building that looked like my grandma's ranch house. Came to find out this was the original farm house. How cool is that!  Our server Polly was great. We chose the chef's tasting menu and were amazed.  The different courses were unique and very delicious. The fresh produce and greens from Chef's garden was a special touch. This is one of the best dinners I've had and was very happy to share it with the birthday man. He had great experience and was happy, as I was.  And I do not think the $$$$ is accurate. The price was nothing compare to the experience  Loved it! Loved it! Definitely going back next time I'm in Phoenix",

    "text": "Had a fabulous time here with my husband celebrating my birthday last weekend. We both got \"The Farmer's Feast\" and it was truly amazing. I was not expecting that we would each get unique dishes so that let us sample even more of the food (though the hubby didn't really share too much). I highly recommend this option for anyone dining here.   The antipasti was a great selection of cured meats and local cheeses. Next, I had a wonderful salad that was a great combination of sharp peppery flavors mixed with sweet. Strawberries, arugula, radishes, yum! For pasta course I got gnocchi with a rich and tasty cream sauce and my husband got ravioli stuffed with yam. His dish was amazing, I had to fight for a couple bites. For the fish course I had poached halibut that was served with some kind of really flavorful sauce and a vegetable puree so that whole thing was extremely delicious. The hubby got a very lightly seared tuna fillet. I was very surprised that he enjoyed it so much since he is usually not a raw fish kind of guy. For our main course I got a pork tenderloin and the hubby got braised beef... just lucky we each got our favorite meats. Each came with other vegetables and starches on the plate so they would have been an ample meal in and of themselves. For dessert, I got a goat cheese cheesecake that was truly amazing. One of the best deserts I have ever eaten. Very rich but the pieces were small enough so that it was not heavy. The dessert did not have too much sweetness so it went well with the ice wine it was served with which tasted like pure honey. Just fantastic. The hubby got bread pudding which we didn't much care for and it came with a sorbet that I didn't try. I got the wine pairings with the meal and every wine just complimented the dish it was served with so beautifully that I was really glad I added that option. Also, it ended up that you got a half glass (at least) with each course so I think it is a good value (the wine pairing was an extra $45.)   I do agree with a couple of the reviewers who mentioned salt. There were a couple of dishes that had just a tad too much. However, I think that was not due to a mistake of the chef, I believe it is just because they use cured meats in a lot of their dishes. Another reviewer mentioned bad service but we did not experience that at all. Our server was extremely warm and friendly. She was very knowledgeable on the food and could answer any questions we had for her. She also took the time for each course to explain each dish and in my case the wine and why they went together. Only one time did my wine not come out at the same time with the food course and in that case our server apologized immediately. I do agree with some of the reviewers that the service is very slow... however, I believe that this is intentional. They have created a very cozy and comfortable environment and they want you to linger and enjoy yourself. With the Farmer's Feast in particular it took us almost 3 hours start to finish but I enjoyed every minute of it. It was nice to have time in between courses to sit and talk and relax. The spacing also kept us from feeling too full by the end (it is six courses after all!) or from letting the flavors from one dish influence the next. I was able to enjoy each course separately and independently with its own unique wine. It was pure food heaven. This is not the type of place where you would stop in for a meal before a show or event; when you come here, this should be your only destination for the night and it is such a great experience that it will be enough!  We truly had fantastic night here.  One warning I will say is for ladies, you need to be prepared for the rural atmosphere and the walk from the car to the restaurant would be challenging in heels (I had been warned so had wedges). In fact the dress code overall was a bit more casual than I was expecting. Kai at Wildhorse Pass resort is my absolute favorite \"special occasion\" restaurant and so we were making a lot of comparisons between the two. My husband made the comment that when we were at Kai we spoke in library whispers the whole time and felt a little awkward at times (you know the type of place where you feel like if you use the wrong fork you may end up getting kicked out) but at Quiessence we were chatting away the whole time and completely at ease. It is definitely a much more comfortable and relaxed environment then any other I have experienced at a restaurant of this caliber.",

    "text": "My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here recently on a Saturday evening. We have been eyeing Quiessence for quite some time as we enjoy the type of fare it serves - fresh, from the farm, etc. We are big gardeners with our own 'mini-farm' in our backyard. We're also vegetarian, so, we were pleased to see the Tasting Menu ($89), offered a vegetarian option.   Overall, I would say Quiessence is 'A-OK,' as yelp puts it (a star rating of 3).   I expected it to be a 5-Star amazing experience, but, it just wasn't. And for two with tip, we spent $350 on two tasting dinners and one bottle of wine. Granted, the wine was $80 for the bottle, however, the overall experience was not worthy of the price.  Why? First, we were sat in the back room. Compared to the middle room or the front room (or in warmer weather - the front lawn), the back room overlooked a gravel pathway, some trees with unlit twinkle lights and a line of trees. We arrived as the sun was setting so I thought, \"it'll be nice once the sun sets and they turn on the twinkle lights on the large trees outside the window.\" Nope, the lights never came on. Instead, I was able to look at the employee parking lot with cars directly parked outside the windows. Again, not a $350 for two view if you ask me. You'd think that at that price point, they'd make it a point to add to the ambience with the lights on the trees and keeping the employee parking away from five feet from the back dining room. It should be noted that I am the type of person that doesn't mind paying for great experiences and food.   The service was fantastic. Our server was knowledgeable, attentive yet not overbearing. She was able to make suggestions knowing we were vegetarian and made great wine suggestions based on our wine taste preferences.  The food. Delicious for the most part. We are big soup people - making our own soups nearly every weekend from scratch. We know good soup and appreciate when it's stellar. The asparagus soup that we were served excited us because we both love asparagus. It was served very fancily - poured over mushrooms from a carafe into the bowl. We both anticipated it to be amazing but instead we were blasted with one taste - SALT! It was so, so, so salty. So salty my wife and I wouldn't finish it. It's almost like whatever sous chef made it accidentally dropped an entire canister of salt in it and thought, \"meh, whatever.\"  One of the best courses of the evening was the 'From The Ground' plate, featuring root plants and purees made from root plants (carrots, radishes, sunchokes). So amazing. Plated beautifully. Everything, in fact, was plated beautifully.  Dessert was also pretty good - not overly sweet and sugary. A bonus was a 'Happy Anniversary' plate of additional small desserts with the 'Happy Anniversary' written in chocolate across the plate.  Perhaps our expectations were too high, but, this is one of those places where you expect greatness and want to leave with those expectations being blown away. Sadly they were not.",

    "text": "Four of us went to celebrate a birthday, heard great things about The Farm and this restaurant...not so much. The ONLY way you can make a reservation is by giving them a credit card, they then proceed to call three times to confirm. Had a great little table inside, where we were looking out at the outside dining area, literally took 15 minutes of us sitting there before the server came over. After she did her spiel on the history of The Farm asked about drinks, 1 soda, 1 martini and 1 watermelon something 25 minutes later they appeared. Leisurely dining I understand, but 25 minutes, when the place was empty. Yes Saturday night a total of 20 diners only (I counted!) Our server had the worst breath, you couldn't even talk to her without getting soured! We ordered the Chef's board for 2 and truly it was fabulous, the bread basket was great as well. Pistachio soup was also ordered and was very good. With regards to entrees, 2 strip steaks, 1 gnocchi, 1 fettucine, lost track of the time we sat there waiting for our entrees, however the manager at one point came over to say our entrees were being plated. Our server, yes the one with the horrible breath, never came back to say anything about where our entrees where. Please note, we never said anything sat there and counted the number of diners! Finally, they arrived and 3 our of four were ice cold, not hot, not room temperature. Waited to spot the server, but again no where to be found, spoke with the manager to explain, and asked for the check. Server(wish she would have given us her name) finally showed up to ask how everything is, told her all was cold, NO APOLOGY, she just walked away. Finally, we received our bill with 3 entrees removed and left. Great birthday celebration, ended up going to get a pizza.",
