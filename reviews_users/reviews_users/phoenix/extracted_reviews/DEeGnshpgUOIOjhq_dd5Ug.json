The chicken was pretty tasteless but they do provide a dipping sauce for it. The ramen broth wasn't good either.   I was planning on giving this place another try until I discovered that my broth had a piece of a STEEL WOOL scrubber  in it as I was swallowing it!!!! Im so glad that this happened to me instead of my 2 year old daughter that was sharing my meal.  I immediately called the restaurant when I informed them of this they offered me a free ramen.  If you want awesome ramen, head to Sushi Ken or Fujiya Martket! Fujiya Market has the best Ton Katsu Ramen but it's only served on Saturdays @ noon in very limited quantities.",

We even said that we could have separate tables, hence one for the kids and one for the adults. They preferred to see us leave, than sit us inside. Great way to never make any of us regular customers...",

Luckily I convinced her to try this Dozo as I know restaurant owners are sometimes known to relocate.  Boy am I glad we went, even though this place is easily a half an hour drive away from our home, it's absolutely worth it. The best Japanese I've had in my 2 year stay in Arizona period! I've looked in all the more well known Japanese restaurants in the Tempe/Mesa area and hardly any at all were even able to prepare a basic Katsu Curry dish! Dozo however delivered exactly the caliber of Japanese food I'm familiar with being from California, everything came with a delicious flavor, nothing felt like it had been sitting in the freezer, fish was fresh, appetizers were varied (we had the Hot Rock and Baked Scallops, absolutely delicious) my Katsudon Curry was perfect and her Sushi was top notch.  For desert the Tempura Ice Cream really hit the spot, it felt very authentic with little decorations that made it awesome and different from any other place I've tried it at. This will become our regular spot for japanese/sushi for sure!  Thank you to the very kind waitress who offered to call us when they're offering Spanish Mackerel too! :)",

My go to is the tonkatsu ramen and they totally nail it. I wish they had actual bottles of sriracha though, because if you ask, they give you a little plate with some squeezed in there and being able to season it to make it more spicy would've made my day - they have a great miso based ramen too that I like as well. Their cha shu or pork is super tender and very flavorful.  They also have sushi rolls which are good but the main reason to check it out is the ramen. Stop by its a great date night location.",

    "text": "Wow what a pleasant surprise in Tempe for some legit Japanese food. Not to be a ramen snob, but I set my expectations pretty low for ramen joints in the US...but I take it for what it's worth. I like to base ramen places on how good gyoza is at the place. Gyoza and ramen go hand in hand like yakitori and beer. So I was very happy to have some perfectly lightly pan fried gyoza. There are several types of ramen: shoyu (soy base), miso, shio (salt base), and tonkotsu (pork base). Tonkotsu is my favorite and I was not disappointed. Best part it comes decked out with all the toppings and an egg which I'm used to paying extra for.   Service was pretty slow but it seems like a newer restaurant and we did come on a Friday night. Still no excuse to wait 20 min for water after being seated. Also for an izakaya I'm surprised there are no sake choices other than the house sake.  Overall, not the best I've ever had, but definitely pretty legit Japanese food with some izakaya food too. I can't wait to come back and try the yakitori and karage I miss from Japan! Dozo!",

When ever we goto LA we always goto get our ramen on in Japantown, as we could never find a ramen place in Phoenix area, until now.   Food: The ramen is what we came for, but we found that sushi is also really good. Most Japanese restaurants in the phoenix area are Korean owned and have Korean mixed in, but this has a lot of True Japanese dishes. My wife likes the   The Pork Ramen is a must! Very flavorful and delicious.   Atmosphere is pleasant and can be family friend or intimate They do have a sushi bar to sit, seating is limited inside, with plenty of seating outside, they are limited on highchairs to just two.   Service is excellent, and very accommodating, as we have a kid that has a very high pitched yell that we decided to move outside so we don't disturb others, that they were more then helpful to relocate us.  I would highly recommend them!",

This restaurant is a Chinese restaurant trying to be a Japanese restaurant. Tonkotsu ramen was wrong in every sense, wrong broth, wrong chashu, & wrong menma.  Gyozas were more like Chinese dumplings (they are mostly pan fried at ramen shops in Japan not deep fried), sauce for agendashi dofu was not right either.  All wait staff were nice (but slow), I just feel deceived about the food.    I will not be retuning to dozo.",

    "text": "An izakaya in the Phoenix area? Excellent! We came here on a Friday night, and due to the liliputian space inside (I think there are only 4 tables or so in the restaurant) we were limited to outside seating. Snagging the last outside table available, we browsed through the menu after the waitress came over to take our drink order.  We ordered a vast quantity of food, enough to feed quite possibly a small army. We arrived just a few minutes before happy hour ended at 7 P.M., so we were lucky enough to partake in happy hour bites as well as regular dinner items. Our array of food included takoyaki, grilled meats, oyako don, spicy miso noodle soup with tofu, \"The hot rock\", sashimi, agedashi tofu, and a massive array of sushi rolls. Out of all the items, my favorites were the takoyaki and the spicy noodle soup. The takoyaki tasted freshly made, with a nice crispy outer shell and big chunks of octopus. The spicy noodle soup had perfectly cooked noodles, with a light broth. The sashimi was fresh, and while the rolls we had were cheap (Approximately 5-6 dollars per roll), you get what you pay for since they were plentiful numbers of them, but they tasted just OK, nothing special. The hot rock was an interesting creation, which I enjoyed. It had a shitake mushroom base, and was topped with cooked spicy tuna, crab, and eel sauce.  Service was friendly, but due to the popularity of the restaurant (There were a lot people waiting inside, and a huge line of people waiting outside the restaurant as more time progressed during our meal), our waitress was a bit absent minded about getting items for us and checking up on us.   The owner is Taiwanese, so the menu isn't strictly Japanese by authenticity standards. Just think of it as Japanese with some Chinese flair. :)  I'll come back here if I'm wanting good takoyaki and other small bites, and if I'm planning on eating here at a less busier time. If you do come at a typically busy time, you've been warned about the wait and limited seating!  Overall, 3.5 stars for me.",

The spicy Ramen with tofu was right on. The noodles had a great texture, and the broth hit the spot. The kids had the chicken katsu bento box.  It was way too much food but well put together.

I have also had the milk tea, and it didn't disappoint me.  They have a few types of hot and ices teas, but since I liked that one I haven't tried any of the others yet.  My most recent visit was to try the Chicken Yakisoba, and that exceeded my expectations on both taste and portion size.  I'm picky about soba noodles, and these were delicious.  I will be heading back there to have these dishes again, as well to try others.  They have a big selection of Japanese food that I haven't found in other restaurants.",

The restaurant is kinda small and there is limited seating inside, but they do have an outside seating area so it's not to bad. We started off with some Matcha Teani (soju mix with matcha green tea, splash lemon juice and mint schnapps ) & Lovely DoZo (soju with sky pineapple , triple sect, red wine and sweet & sour). Both drinks tasted good but we really couldn't taste the alcohol . Then we shared a tuna poke salad which I enjoyed but the poke was thinly sliced. I didn't necessarily hate it but when I think of poke I expect bigger chunks almost cubed like pieces and the small slices of poke was ok. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen with pork and my friend order the spicy miso with pork. Both were pretty good and the flavorful. The spicy miso could have been spicier but my tolerance for spicy food is pretty high so it wasn't spicy to me. Overall the place was clean, our server was nice and I would come back to try some of their other food.",

The main server guy was pretty quick with giving us out menus and water and getting our orders so I didn't experience the slow service everyone is complaining about. I got the spicy miso which was good and my husband got this other ramen that was written as a special on the white board by the entrance called Jigoku ramen, which is way spicier than the spicy miso and has great flavor! (I highly recommend the jigoku ramen if you love spicy food). We got the chicken heart, chicken gizzard, and baby octopus yakitori and they were all pretty good with good flavor. You have to eat them when they get to your table and not yet them get cold because it's not as good. I probably won't get the heart again because the texture is pretty different. Prices are good, waters were filled, food was great! Can't complain here.",

They also serve it with a proper spoon, that has some depth to it for spooning broth. Every other Japanese place I've ever been to used really shallow spoons that are frustrating to use for anything besides collecting noodles.    The Poke was outstanding.  The fish tasted super fresh, and the sacue was a well balanced mix, more salty than sweet.   My biggest take away was the quality of the ingredients.  The chicken was tender and tasted super fresh.  Same story with the Ahi tuna in the poke.  I want to go back today.  Just might.",

They do you have a nice menu of small grilled items, I got one of the baby squid it was really good and I'm interested to try some of the other grilled items they have.   They have a sushi menu as well I tried some nigiri and one or two of their sushi rolls. Shrimp tempura was different then I have had at other places. I'm not sure it was my favorite.

When we first showed up, it wasn't crowded at all. Servers were friendly...tables are clean. Totally love it. We ordered a spicy tuna roll from the happy hour menu. We also ordered many skewers to try out. My favorite is the chicken wings. It is crunchy on the outside and it was absolutely delicious. My second favorite is the octopus. Chicken,beef, and onions were equally delicious too.   I've got a feeling that the owner recognized me and my yelp review from a year ago. I could feel his not so happy eye contact towards our table from time to time lol. I saw him smiling at and being very nice to everyone except to us. It is all good. I still enjoy the food.

I recommend getting fried/baked rolls because fresh sushi is hard to come by here in the desert lol   Their Spicy Miso Ramen was also okay for me but I have been much spoiled in the city of Torrance, apparently \"Japan's sister city\" in California so you may want to give it a try.   Despite all this mediocrity, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was very cozy. Also, their Tempura Udon and Beef Tongue yakitori were perfection!

    "text": "Really good. I've been twice.  First time i went for lunch:  I chose a beef teriyaki and tempura bento. It wasn't the normal cut or flavor of teriyaki i was expecting, but good. The sauce was not sweet, and the beef was in little squares as opposed to the strips in sweet sauce I'm used to. Not the norm, but by no means bad. The tempura was absolutely fantastic. The tempura assortment included a shishito pepper, something I'd never seen in tempura.. but now all I can think of is eating a whole basket of them. The batter on all pieces was extremely airy, almost lacy, delicate, but not falling apart, and served only seconds from the fryer. A+ on technique. Dozo Izakaya understands the critical and oft forgotten art of serving the dish at it's absolute best moment... more on that later.  The sushi was well made and traditionally sized, everything able to be eaten in one bite aside from the futomaki. The miso soup was not from a packet and had a very good dashi flavor with proper smoke and mirin flavors, with silken tofu. The rice in the bento was a bit cold but not bad  My dining companion had the pork katsu with philly roll bento, and did not have any complaints. The bento included a nice sesame ball, the salad had a nice sweet mayo/vinegar dressing.  Lunch service was good if a bit slow, but the place was packed, and the lone waitress did comment on and apologize for the delay. This place is pretty small, about 50 seats total. Best for parties 4 or fewer, but can accomodate parties of six, and they offer reservations. The sushi bar seats only accounts for 5 so it's a solo or 2 person affair. They have a patio but it was too hot on our lunch visit.  Now on to dinner. I went with the intention of only eating from the Izakaya menu. i've eaten [and drank] at 'the real deal' in Osaka and Kyoto and this is the only place I've ever seen in Arizona that has a menu that even resembles theirs. It's an assortment of yakitori, soups, and small plates meant to be shared and enjoyed with beer, sake, rice whiskey (shoju/shochu), or a fine cocktail. The yakitori selections here include 'nasty bits'; artfully grilled chicken gizzards, hearts, skins, and beef tongue are available on little skewers (2 per order, per izakaya tradition norms). These are truly worth the visit as they present amazing flavors and textures, and rarely seen in casual establishments out here. You can also get spiced fried wings, grilled chicken breast with green onion, grilled sirloin, and many other 'less daring' options.  The dish that drew me back for dinner were the shishito peppers... I knew I wasn't going to get them tempura style, but the fact they were on the izakaya menu piqued my curiosity. They arrived cooked a bit more than expected, no longer crispy, but fried with garlic and either butter or olive oil, and garnished with sesame and the best garnish I have ever seen anywhere. They were just laid in a bowl, and then topped with very finely shredded bonito flakes in tiny strips. It was moving and dancing in a very noticable manner as the light-as-air flakes dissolved and collapsed into the heat and oil of the peppers they were resting on. Another testament to the importance Dozo Izakaya puts on prep-to-table presentation. They did it again with the takoyaki, which was served piping hot with a delicate crisp outside and an almost molten inside. Really REALLY good, but again, the dancing katsuobushi garnish were just unexpected and beyond the standard 'extra mile' a cook could take. I finished with my first ever whole fried sweet prawn... I ate every last bit except the tail.  Dinner service was attentive if a little hurried, despite the place not being as full as it was at lunch. I really dislike servers asking if I want more food while everyone is actively eating or enjoying a sip from a drink, but again it was one server for the whole place, and they were always on point with getting the food from the pass to the table ASAP. This is a tight operation that knows what it is doing, and it is worth every one of the 4 stars. It's not perfect, but it is unique and very very good.  I wish I could just get a whole pile of tempura shishito peppers. They're on to something here. Also, this place closes way too early. An izakaya should be open until midnight or later.   P.S. Other reviewers point out this place is not Japanese owned, and there is a bit of fusion going on, keep an open mind. This is a Japanese based menu with Chinese and Singaporean twists.",

Like some fellow Yelpers have pointed out this is a Chinese/Taiwanese owned Japanese Tapas-like place. Overall the quality of the food is good as long as you can close one eye and forget about the authenticity of the food. Consider it as a Japanese-Taiwanese fusion diner then you are fine. Sushi is a *meh* for me, Yakitori and other skewer items are OK, Ramen depends on the kind of broth that you order (Tonkotsu  and  Shio are better than the others) but the noodle itself that they use tends to be salty. Since the place is new and the staff is super nice, I shall wait and see how this place can mature and evolve into a more established place to go in coming months. 3.5 Stars.",

They have an extensive Sake selection (both cold and hot) and serve coke products (which I prefer).  Traditional items that we appreciated having a chance to sample in anticipation for our upcoming trip to Japan which is why we chose to visit and found out about a coupon we received in the mail.",

When we arrived, we were greeted in a friendly manner and seated right away.  That was nice, but the setting was that of a typical, small teishoku restaurant and not that of the typical izakaya.  No small, low tables with low seats; no low tables with the charcoal grills built into the middle.  I also believe they grill the kushiyaki in the kitchen instead of on the charcoal grills; at least that is what I think because the food has no charcoal flavor.  We were told that they had a big party the previous night and they ran out of most of the beef and chicken types of kushiyaki and did not have any to serve last night --- WTH?  They also had no chicken wings.  That was last night; why didn't the owner/manager make some more immediately this morning?  Pretty lame if you ask me.  We are told we are in luck since it is happy hour time and given a happy hour menu.  Very weak menu -- no \"good stuff\" on the menu, just routine things.  I order my GF a margarita and she says it is OK, although it looks pretty sad.  I try to order a pitcher of beer, but am told that pitchers are not on happy hour, only glasses.......how sad is that?  I order some food for my GF -- edamane, agedashi tofu, and the chicken katsu dinner.  Those were decent and I have no complaint about those dishes.  I ordered shishamo which were two little skimpy fishes, about the size of a #2 pencil.  I also ordered shishito's which were a nice sized ordered, but drenched in a very salty soy based sauce.  They had no yaki onigiri because nobody was ordering it so they took it off the menu....WTH?  Sacrilege!!!  You got rice -- make a rice ball and grill it on the charcoal grill......oh yeah, maybe there is no charcoal grill.  On the \"specials\" blackboard they had aji, which is one of my favorites.  So I order one, sashimi style with the bones and head deep fried.  This one dish was pretty expensive @ $14, and I was disappointed.  The fish was not fresh so the sashimi was mushy and off tasting.  However, they did fry the bones nicely. I also order a buta kushiyaki and that too was disappointing.  Not very good or appropriate piece of pork and just grilled with salt -- no sauce or seasoning on the two sticks.  So all-in-all, I was disappointed and will not be back.  I will keep searching for an izakaya in the Phoenix area.",

    "text": "Came in lunch to try the ramen. Greeted by a very nice staff and was seated promptly. My wife ordered the Shoyu Ramen and myself the spicy miso Ramen. The cost was $11.95 but for $3.50 more you could add a small order (3 pieces) of perfectly crisp and tasty gyoza and then either choose a milk boba tea or side of rice. Wife chose the drink I chose the rice. WOW - Plenty of food to feed a small army. Now I know when people review Ramen they tend to become very territorial as to what's best in their opinion. Both my wife and I have had Ramen in Victoria, Canada as well as San Diego and all points in between. I must say each of ours were outstanding. Both broth's where very good- just enough salt and the noodles were chewy without being gummy. Decent size menu with a big focus on grilled meats of different cuts. Nice clean and I stress clean dining room - sushi bar area as well. My wife and I pulled up about 10 minutes prior to opening and watched several staff members clean down ever piece of patio furniture and canvas the entire area for any trash. We will be back - Ramen is a must!",

We politely sat there instead & had drinks & appetizers. After getting passed up for a table 2x, I asked about it & the owner abruptly said, \"ok, I'll seat you next.\"   While we continued to wait & I then needed to add 1 more to our party. I asked her nicely if we could make our party for 5. She then yelled at me at the top of her lungs and told me that they have no seat for me. I asked nicely, \"Excuse me? You're not able to seat us with one more?\"   She then aggressively told me,\"NO!\" To the point where the sushi chef behind the counter said something to her in their native language & she yelled at him too! I paid my bill & We will never go back.   If you want poor service like, Soup Nazi from the Seinfeld show. Come here. Otherwise, there are plenty other sushi places in Phoenix that you can eat at.  correction: I assumed it was one of the owners but it was not. Still, they represent the business & I have never been treated so poorly!",

Service was slow and awful: Despite having only one other table besides us, they took several minutes to greet us and offer water. We then had to ask several times to get napkins, plates, and soy sauce dips. When the food finally came out (at different times, by the way), it was yet another disappointment. My husband ordered the salmon teriyaki bento and the salmon piece was laughably small for a dinner, or any real meal for that matter. My pork katsu curry had neither the fragrance nor the flavor that a curry should have, and the tonkatsu tasted bitter, probably due to being fried in overused oil. We will not be going back, nor recommending this place to anyone.",

    "text": "There were multiple reasons why I loved this place!   I have been wanting to try ramen for AGES but I'm not a big pork eater (I basically never eat it), and I didn't want my ramen to have pork broth. I love that this place had many different options!! Even vegetarian for my veggie friends! I got the Spicy Miso, which was delicious but a bit too spicy for me so I added some soy sauce. Next time I might try the regular Miso and add some spice but the Spicy Miso was delicious with lots of flavor! I added shrimp to my bowl.  I also loved their service. The server and the other employees were SO incredibly nice and attentive. My friend and I came one hour til closing time (sorry!!) and usually some employees will be hasty or rude if you do that, but not this place! They were kind and allowed us time to order whatever we wanted! My friend and I had literally the exact same order: Thai Iced Tea with Boba, Shrimp Spicy Miso Ramen, One Spicy Salmon Roll (we split it), and One Green Tea Ice Cream (we split it). It was all delicious, I highly recommend any of those items.  Next up were the prices which were AMAZING. Also, the place was so kind and didn't charge us for the ice cream! I paid only $17 for all of that ^^ !!!!!!and the ramen is HUGE! We put it in a to go box LOL   This place was also clean and felt super authentic! I had such a great experience trying real ramen (Not Republic Ramen, ew) for the first time!!   Thank you so much DOZO Izakaya I will be back for sure!!",

I love that they have a ton of different choices for ramen, including broth; and I can get a vegetarian option. Actually, they have a ton of vegetarian options in general here. My parents love the pork and pork bone ramen, and have tried a few of their rice bowl and tempura dishes.  The restaurant is clean and well organized; everyone is friendly (we usually get take out so I can't comment too much on the service). A definite place to try if you like ramen and you're in the area!",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  I agree, the service here can be slow.  I also agree, this is not your typical izakaya joint.  But you know what, some of the best izakaya in LA aren't \"traditional\" izakaya joints either.  So that being said, there is much good food to redeem this place.  First, a note to the sushi people.  This is NOT a sushi joint.  If you're coming here expecting great sushi, you will be disappointed.  The sushi here is average at best, and I people that come here just for that, don't know what izakaya is about.  Izakaya.  Japanese gastropub.  Not sushi restaurant.  You order beer.  You eat tapas-style.  You get yaki-tori and fried food and eat with your hands.  In every case, Japanese restaurant does not equal sushi joint.  As noted by many, the tonkotsu ramen here is actually pretty darn good, and I'd say one of the best in the Valley.  (See my review of Tampopo in Tempe.)  They don't make their noodles in-house. but they are always chewy.  I have always, ALWAYS, gotten a perfect soft-boiled egg here, which is no small feat.  The broth is deep, rich, and on the right side of salty (although I do suspect they use some MSG, which really isn't a huge problem.  Get over the MSG thing people, very few of you actually have sensitivity to it, you need to eat huge amounts of it, and glutamates are in SO MANY FOODS naturally, says - almost every study out here.)  The yaki-tori also shines here, along with the other skewered delights.  Try the chicken hearts people.  And the gizzard.  They are chewy and delicious.  So is the beef tongue, and the ama-ebi (whole sweet shrimp).  EAT THE HEAD.  It is good, it won't kill you.  Also delicious are the flash fried shishito peppers and the cartilage.  (Not cartridge, as it's written on the menu.)  Every deep fried here is deep fried in rice flour, which makes for a ever so slightly crunchy and delicate batter.  The cartilage is crunch on crunch and when you have it alongside the cabbage with sweet mayo, the salty-sweet combo makes for a satisfying snack.     And the fried chicken wings.  These may be, very possibly, the best non-Buffalo wings in the Valley.  They come out hot.  They come out crispy.  They are huge.  And they are damn tasty.  So again, I implore you.  Don't stick with the sushi.  Treat the place like an izakaya, drink some beers, and stack the skewers.    (Honda Ya, Furaibo, you guys are still safe at 5-stars at home in LA.)",

    "text": "This is a great little place!  I came here on a Saturday at about 11:30 am.  I was worried that the place would be packed, but to my surprise, it was fairly empty.  We were seated as soon as we came in.  The decor is very nice and the place is very clean.  My only complaint is that it was very warm in the dining area.  I cooled myself off with my menu and decided on the spicy miso ramen lunch special.  I opted for the tuna roll as my side.  My girlfriend ordered the bento box and spicy tuna roll.  Hers came with a miso soup for starters.  The miso soup came first and I had to resist the urge to ask my girlfriend for a taste, but I knew I'd have my own huge bowl soon enough.  My ramen and sushi came next, and my girlfriends food came right behind that.  I was amazed about how huge the bowl of ramen was and worried if I would be able to finish it.  I tried a little bit of everything from my girlfriend's bento box, and everything was very good.  The beef was tender and flavorful.  Her only complaint was that she wished there was a bit more food, and she's very petite and isn't a huge eater.  I'm sure it would take a few bento boxes to fill up a guy of my size.  The ramen was so good.  It's the first time trying restaurant quality ramen and I'm glad it's more popular and available now.  The spice amount was just right, my nose was running by the time I finished the bowl. And yes, I did finish it.  Since this is my first time, I can't say it's the best I've ever had.  I will try some other places and see how they all stack up.  I was also pleased when the check came.  The lunch specials are very reasonably priced, and usually, when I'm in this area, I spend twice for lunch with my girlfriend.  I hope I'll get to try the Izakaya portion of the menu, since it's one of my favorite types of cuisine.  It's not really close enough to me to try it in the evening, but the next time I am in the area at happy hour time, I will stop here for sure.  I'm pretty envious of people who live in this area considering all of the options they have.  A very strong concentration of really good restaurants.",

I had a bento box with pork katsu and spicy tuna roll- I loved the variety and it was just enough to fill me up! The only negative thing was the pitcher of beer. When the lady poured our beer out of the pitcher, the entire glass was full of foam. So they had to wait to drink it until most of the foam went away... Which was a little disappointing. My girlfriend also ordered the chicken heart and chicken liver skewers which I'm not personally to thrilled about but she loved them so that's all that matters :) we will for sure be back!! we will just order our beer bottled next time :)",

I was  bit worried after looking at their menu that they were trying to be the \"jack of all trades\" and Master of none in regard to izakaya style food, but it was good enough that I went twice during my short trip to the area.    I highly recommend the various yakatori items.  The first night I went I mainly had those.  Nicely done.  Be sure to try the pork belly and the mackerel.  I really wanted some Hamachi Kama but they were out.  The chicken harts were good, but not the best I every had but way above average.  A nice selection of sake was a welcome sign as well.  The next night when I went back for a second go round I wanted to try the ramen.  It was fine.  I had the Tonkatsu style, which I typically prefer.  Theirs was good, but it lacked the richness I come to look for in this style.  Noodles were nice, egg was cooked properly, but the broth was missing something.  Not saying it was bad, just not up to what I've come to expect for this type of ramen.    Service was friendly and excellent.  Prices are reasonable, I plan to go again when ever I'm in the area.",

We got thereat 8 PM on a Friday and the place was PACKED, always a good sign.  We didnt want to load up on food before the ramen so The Boy ordered the Gyoza, pan fried, and I order Escolar Nigri.  I have struggled to find good Escolar aka White Tuna aka Butterfish here in the Valley but this was amazing.  No fishy smell, no odd flavor, just buttery deliciousness.  I could have eaten it all night.  The Gyoza are a do not miss.  The pan fried bottoms were ah-may-zing, the perfect amount of light and crispy.   We each got Ramen for our entree, The Boy got the Spicy Miso with Chicken and I opted for Sho-yu Ramen with pork.  The broth was very good, the noodles a little but too al dente for my tastes but still good.  The piece of pork that came with my ramen was the best part of the dish.  I gave The Boy and taste and he regretted going chicken with his ramen but still liked his dish.  He really liked the spice of the Spicy Miso and finished his dish.  The service was a little slow so make sure you budget your time but everything else about Dozo was awesome!",

We were originally here for the takoyaki but ended up trying the ramen just to make sure we don't miss anything. Both the \"pork bone broth\" ramen and the \"extremely spicy\" sure do live up to their description. The pork bone broth is filled with flavor and is extremely rich due to the pork bone being simmered. While the spicy one is not for the weak of heart. Both are very delicious, and the takoyaki is not too doughy which is a big plus for me. I would definitely return here as mentioned and will recommend others to come here.",

My boyfriend and I got seated right away around 6:30pm and ordered with a pencil on their paper menu. We got served the ramen first and then the yakitori. We both had the tonkatsu ramen, which was rich in flavor, but we added chili powder and oil too - and that made it perfect! We got the yakitori of squid legs and chicken gizzards while eating our ramen. They sold out on the beef tongue which was disappointing but eating the yakitori definitely brought my rating down for this restaurant. They tasted over cooked with more of a charred/burnt flavor than the sauce and meat itself. I would come here only for ramen next time. They also have 5-6:30pm happy hour, which we made it to but didn't want anything off that menu (which included rolls and alcoholic drinks). Service was quick and ramen isn't bad so 3.5 stars if I could rate with halvesz",

I felt discriminated because the Chinese waitress would serve bento box to white customers who came 20 minutes later than us first while we had to wait nearly an hour for them to bring simple ramen and udon (which are not that hard to make.... 15 min max!!) and yet she still forgot to bring all our order. We decided to cancel the order they forgot to bring because we figured it's gonna take another 20 minutes if we were to wait. The poor female customer sitting next to us didn't even get served until more than an hour later for a mere katsudon ! I also noticed that the waitress didn't clear the messy table next to us until 30 min after the customers left which is not very efficient and gross. The food itself was acceptable but with the service like this I cannot give more than 2 stars.",

    "text": "Dozo Izakaya 440 W. Warner Road, Tempe, 85284  Our group arrived at 6:00 and was promptly seated. This is a relatively small restaurant and they had three large groups all at the same time, which made service a tad slow.  Drink orders were taken, and I had a wonderful cup of hot green tea (possibly Genmai Cha) which had a nutty flavor to it. Over the course of the meal I think I drank at least 4 cups of it, it was so good.  For the starter, I ordered the Baked Green Mussels - Very nicely made - not smothered in sauce like some places do. We were off to a good start.  Next I tried some of the sushi. Because it was Eel Day in Japan I ordered Unagi (freshwater eel). It was nicely presented with the proper sauce on top and still nice and warm. Next was Tako (octopus). It was cut nice and thin so that it was not chewy at all and had nice flavor. I ordered Tamago (egg omelet sushi) and Inari (Tofu pouches filled with sweet rice), but never got to taste them because a number of my companions grabbed them before I could! They loved them.  Because happy hour was not over until 6:30 and we arrived at 6:00, I ordered a California Roll and a Crunch Spicy Tuna Roll at a reduced price. Both rolls were nicely made and of a good size. Special kudo's for the crunch roll which was extra delicious and had wonderful flavor.  Finally, I got to the Izakaya Menu. In Japan, Izakaya shops are known for small plates usually served with good cold beer. Most often they serve Yakitori which are individual small pieces of chicken on skewers, grilled over special charcoal and coated with a flavorful glaze.   The waitress brought out a large assortment of them for me. The Sunagimo (chicken gizzard) was nicely chewy, and the Hatsu (chicken hearts) melted in my mouth. The Negima (chicken breast with green onion) which is very popular in Japan was excellent and the Tori Momo (chicken thigh) was delicious. The Teba (chicken wings) were nicely cooked and had just a touch of spice to them and the Tori Kawa (chicken skin) was so good it brought tears to my eyes. At every bite I was reminded of eating in Japan because the food was so authentic.  Lastly, I had Tako Yaki (Octopus flour balls), a favorite street food in Japan. They were nicely made with a hardened outer shell, a type of bread filling, and a piece of octopus in the center. It had some Japanese mayonnaise over the top along with some bonito flakes. It was so good.  My ending bite was Saba (seasoned raw mackerel sushi) which was some of the best I have ever had.  Companions (6 of them) had some wonderful super light tempura, as well as a Curry Katsu (pork cutlet curry) and a Katsu Don (Panko breaded pork cutlet over rice with egg and sweet onions).  The restaurant was nice and clean, and while service could have been better, one has to take into account that they were trying to handle 3 large groups at one time.  4 stars for outstanding food, cleanliness, and trying their best to serve three large groups in a small restaurant. I will definitely be coming back to eat here again and again.",

It looked really close to what I usually see in Japan. However, the flavor is weak. Especially, the soup of Tonkotsu ramen was very weak. Tonkotsu soup should be thick and strong. Of course it's healthier not to make that way but ramen isn't healthy food.  Other izakaya foods tasted good but they are $1~$2 more expensive than the same quality restaurants in California. Onigiri shouldn't cost $5. It's usually the one of the cheapest food in izakaya. It's maybe hard to make it as inexpensive as California but still too expensive.  If they could lower the price by $1 for all izakaya menu, I'm sure this place will be packed with Japanese people.",

    "text": "The first and second time I came here I enjoyed the service, atmosphere, and food (sushi, poke bowl, ramen, bento boxes are all delicious!). However, last night when I arrived my husband and I were ignored to the point where we left and went elsewhere. Now, we are reasonable and patient people. We saw a very large group of patrons and understood that the wait time for food was going to be increased. Regardless we were willing to sip on some beverages and wait. Unfortunately as we entered the restaurant no one greeted us, so we politely waited at the 'please wait to be seated' sign for 10 minutes. Another gentleman who walked in at minute 10 walked straight up to the bar, asked the chef if he could sit there, and proceeded to sit down. This wasn't upsetting, perhaps we should have done the same since there were 2 seats open. But then, while we were still standing and reading the menu we then saw the waitress bring this now-seated-gentleman a glass of water. This was all before we were ever even greeted. We left after waiting at the door, ungreeted, for another 5 minutes. So, ok maybe 15 minutes doesn't sound like a long time. But it is for people who worked a 10 hour shift and wanted dinner. It's also a long time to not even be greeted. And it's certainly annoying when you watch them serve someone else who walked in after you. Dozo, I'll give you another try because I liked your food. But you're in the service industry...please be better prepared next time and don't ignore other patrons just because a large party is present!",

The appetizer was really very good, it came in a big seashell! I would absolutely get that again. The rolls were ok, nothing amazing but pretty good. I tried two classics; the philly roll and the spicy tuna roll. Both were on their happy hour menu, yay for discounts! They were good but too warm. I expected them to be cold since they weren't baked or fried. That was the only thing I didn't like... which leads me to wonder how cold are they keeping their fish? But I didn't get sick or anything and I'm hoping it was a fluke so I would go back and try them again. Also service was friendly, a little slow, but that was ok, I was enjoying a slow paced evening to start my weekend.",

We ordered two ramen dish, miso and tonkotsu, have to say the tonkotsu ramen was probably the worst one I have had in Arizona so far. The pork was not prepared right, lean meat was cook too old yet the fatty part are still greasy; the bamboo was cooked way too long, it's suppose to be crunchy not soft; and the soup itself, they probably added a gallon of salt in it.  The only thing I liked was the o'nigiri. Other than food, the restaurant has a nice environment, waiters was very niceWill give this restaurant another try, probably something other than ramen tho lol  ____________________________  Updating 2/19!  2nd time was much better, ordered bento box for lunch and the tempuras were great! Takoyaki was well made too, I'm definitely coming back for after work snack time, their appetizers and small plates are pretty good!",

Same with my husband's shio broth..it wasn't very flavorful. The chicken in my husband's ramen was tasteless. The pork in my ramen was supposed to be the star of the dish but it wasn't good like other ramen places I've been to.   Overall food was okay. Service was fine, too. Will I come back? Probably not.

The food here was honestly pretty bad. Negima is standard izakaya food. Grilled chicken and scallions. The chicken was rock hard and not very flavorful. The scallions were over cooked and dried. If you can't serve a decent negima, you shouldn't call yourself an izakaya.   The rest of the food we ordered was just as disappointing. Ramen, hamachi kama, and sushi rolls were all mediocre at best. The waitress was not friendly at all, almost to the point of coming off as rude. The only redeeming aspect of this restaurant is their cheap beer. But I can drink beer at home and microwave better food than this place serves. I live within a 5 min walk to this place and I will never be back.",

    "text": "Decent ramen, horribly slow service.  Came here primarily for the ramen and the fact that they serve Yakitori. Arrived around dinner time to a full house, patio and interior but found it's business due to the lack of staff. Took about 5-10 minutes before actually being seated. I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen and a Gyu Tan skewer (Beef Tongue).   The ramen took a bit to come out, but I was pleased. It definitely is a large portion, noodles eggy but on the thinner side (think Chinese egg noodles) and cooked a tad bit over. The broth itself was rich, not too fatty but very opaque and had an interesting smoky flavor to it. Smoky broth was a first and I really enjoyed it, it definitely gave the ramen richness and umpf! You get two thick, but tender and fatty pieces of Char shu, a marinated half boiled egg which is probably the best ramen egg I've had here in Arizona along with typical toppings such as green onions, a tiny bit of bamboo shoots and a small pieces of seaweed. Definitely a better ramen than that you can find here, though I wish they had some Chili Powder or crushed garlic on the side to add.   The Gyu Tan skewer was kind of sad. Tiny pieces of beef tongue on two skewers, though tender and flavorful I felt that a little green onions or splash of lemon would've elevated the skewer. It was also $5, yikes!  Service is pretty slow, to the point that a few people left while waiting to be seated. From waiting to be seated, getting our order in and actually getting our food took an hour. Also when our food did arrive we didn't get any utensils or napkins. Price point is decent for ramen and typical, skewers are overpriced and lacking. Typically, skewers should be around $2 and upwards only for seafood and seasonal market type items.   *Take aways: good, solid bowl of ramen worthy of 4 stars*  This place has a lot of potential, please increase your staffing ratio or retrain. I've worked in a restaurant where I was the only server working with a manager serving a full restaurant and it is stress inducing and straining for workers and doesn't lead to good quality customer service.",

My go to is their spicy miso ramen, spicy tuna roll and/or their poki tuna roll. I like to visit during their lunch time because they have a great special on ramen + sushi together. Their bento boxes are great as well! Ryan, our usual waiter is awesome! He always remembers what my boyfriend, sister and I orders and also is very patient with us when we ask to change the TV to baseball. Because this cute little restaurant is little, table waits + dinner rushes can be lengthy (my only complaint), however, the wait is always worth it! Highly recommend visiting!",

    "text": "This review is for the ramen as I did not try any other items on the menu. Came here with a co-worker on a Friday for lunch. Saw the grand opening sign outside and when we got to the door, we could hear Japanese metal blasting out the speakers. Interesting... I opened the door and was greeted immediately with Irashaimasu! Wait. WTF? It's supposed to be Irashaimase! Felt a little awkward and uneasy for a moment. The waitress sat us at a counter facing the parking lot. After a quick look at the menu, I decided to try the Tonkotsu Char-Siu ramen. Co-worker got the spicy miso chicken ramen. Waitress seemed disappointed we weren't ordering any rolls or Izakaya items and kept asking \"that's all? that's all?\" Another awkward moment. We're here for a quick lunch within our lunch hour - not a 3 martini lunch while splurging on the corporate card FFS! While we waited for the ramen I noticed that the music from the speakers was a curious mix of J-Pop and Japanese hard rock and heavy metal - bands like Thee Michelle Gun Elephant - which I don't remember ever hearing at a Japanese restaurant anywhere in the United States nevermind Arizona. It did give the atmosphere of stepping into another country for a moment. I also noticed that the staff were speaking what sounded like Chinese amongst themselves. That explained the earlier awkwardness. When I finally got my ramen, I grabbed my spoon and sipped the tonkotsu broth. It had the tonkotsu flavor alright - a little weak though. Noodles were alright. Char Siu was very flavorful and perfect and so was the menma (bamboo) in the ramen. My only other benchmark for ramen of any kind in the Phoenix metro area is unfortunately Republic Ramen on University - which of course, gets stomped to the curb by this place. Doesn't say much though because most 25 cent ramen packages at the grocery store can do that to Republic Ramen's ramen as well. Let's just say that for now, if I'm craving a bowl of ramen and don't want to cross state lines, this will have to do.",

We ordered two rolls, I didn't even taste the spicy tuna roll..the spicy salmon we had was not fresh.  The salmon sashimi wasn't fresh.  The uni was ok....I've had better at the cheap rotating sushi places.  The tuna poke was pretty fresh and very flavorful  I also had butter fish, dressing on the salad that accompanied this dish was amazing.  Fish was ok, not great.  Ramen broth was very tasty (spicy miso) however the noodles weren't very good.  A little too on the mushy side for my taste.  All in all I was expecting a lot more, especially for a restaurant that is having a grand opening.  I'll be back to give it another shot, but I think I'll wait awhile as my stomach isn't too happy with me right now.  The waitress was really nice and noticed we didn't eat any of our sushi, so she took off one of the rolls.  She really should have taken both rolls and the sushi off if our bill as we didn't even touch them they were so fishy  I hope they freshen up their fish for our next visit",

I saw they had ramen and udon (never really seen that at an Izakaya) but thought what the heck can't be worse than Republic Ramen (nastiest ramen ever). I walked in and the lady who greeted me was very nice, I ordered my tonkotsu ramen and waited to see what it was all about. I am really picky when it comes to ramen (I go to Kurume Japan about once a year and all over Kyushu to eat ramen). In comparison to the ramen in Arizona I must say it is the best here. In California I don't know if I would order it...  The broth was ok but felt like something was missing, the noodles were cooked well but not the right kind of noodles... It was over all ok and I might order it if I'm not going to California or Japan anytime soon. For me they will be a place i can eat ramen without being utterly disappointed. I'm sure many people will like it! As for me it's ok, cuz I'm picky as hell. I want to try other stuff here and I'm sure I will. This is the first place where I am actually willing to return to in Arizona. The service helped a lot and gave them the extra star.  I want to try some other stuff they have and I will update as I try their other items. Give em a try",

    "text": "Just left from dinner on a Thursday night and have to say that this was one of the best dining experiences that I've had in quite a while.   To start, we got there a little early ...4:55 (our daughter has volleyball around the corner from 5-6:30). The owner/chef saw us walking up and invited us in telling us to come in early, out of the heat. Every member of the staff greeted us exuberantly and made us feel welcome, but in a \"come in and have a great time\" kind of way. Since we were early, we had our choice of seats. The was exceptionally clean and had a nice look and feel to it. Both the waitress and chef/ owner engaged us in conservation and after finding out that this was or first time, took the time to explain the menu offerings and, most importantly, the happy hour specials, which are fantastic!   Because we (my wife and I) were with with my parents, we ordered a variety of items both off the happy hour menu as well as the IZAKAYA menu. All were outstanding. My parents ordered some standards, Philly roll and california roll, which were really good, but not what I was in the mood for. I was looking for some more excitement, so from the IZAKAYA menu, I ordered the beef, onion, and rice bowl (melt in your mouth great), the sausage (which you MUST eat with the fresh garlic or really not understand how good it is), the chicken skin (best I've ever had), and the baby octopus (which were perfectly grilled and just the right amount of heat). My mother, who is of Polish descent, was  excited to find chicken hearts and gizzards on the same menu. Both were exceptional. My wife, who is vegetarian and usually not too excited about sushi places, was thrilled to see such a variety of options. Along with spring rolls, she ordered the yam and avocado roll which I also tried and loved.  But best of all, in my opinion was the service. Impeccable is the best word to describe it. Not over bearing, but always right there before you think you need it. Plus, the owner, chef was a great conversationalist and happy to offer suggestions and really went or of his way to make us feel welcome.   To sum up, there is only one thing to say...this is my new favorite restaurant!",

Biggest gripe about this place here was the beer. Only 1 beer (Sapporo) on tap and it was $6 a glass and was about 1/3 head. For an Izakaya restaurant they should at least know how to pour a beer properly and have at least a few selections. A True Izakaya should be first and foremost about drinking.",

It's no Cherry Blossom quality, a bit bland regarding the broth, but not bad.  We shared some Gyoza, good.  My dinner companion ordered the Teriyaki bento box, seemed a bit small on the portion of chicken itself, but it had good flavor.  Not too sweet.  I will add this into the rotation but I would prefer Shimagamo or Cherry Blossom before this if I prefer Japanese flair.  I will try their sushi and Izakaya style skewers next time.",

    "text": "If you are looking for authentic Japanese in the Tempe/Ahwatukee area, DOZO is definitely the way to go. It is hidden in a lot where there's not much going on so it is pretty easy to miss but thank goodness for Yelp for helping me find this little gem! It is a tiny restaurant with few tables inside, sushi bar seating as well as generous outside patio seating but I have never seen this place very busy. (Keep in mind their hours, they do close during the day for lunch as some Japanese restaurants do). You are most likely to be seated right away by one of their very kind waitresses. They are really so lovely. They are timely and so attentive. This is what I love about small restaurants. And the rest is as good as it can get. I've always come with the craving for ramen and their special tonkatsu pork is the bomb diggity. I've tried the spicy miso as well but most definitely prefer the tonkatsu flavor over miso. If you are an adventurous eater, they have small plates of what I'm guessing are delicacies of Japan such as beef tongue and octopus (which isn't bad I must say). Last time I came in, I got the chicken katsudon and I killed the whole thing in one sitting. And that's saying a lot because 1, it was a huge portion. An entire cutlet of breaded chicken with lots of rice. OH man was I full and satisfied. The chicken was cooked and breaded to perfection with egg and caramelized onions with an amazing sweet soy based sauce that the rice was drenched in. I finished every last bit of it and I am a tiny girl. I rarely finish my food. The sushi is great as well. Definitely make a visit to this place if you are in the area. You won't regret it.",

But one more expensive fish was substituted with much cheaper fish, without telling us. The chef probably think we won't notice. We asked for the replacement and the chef did. But feel this kind of sushi store is dishonest and will not go again.   The fish quality is in average, not really fresh nor very bad, but they come in quite thin and small size than other sushi place. So if you are really into sashimi or sushi, you will feel disappointed.",

I consider myself an adventurous eater and there were definitely some items I could not wait to try.   I ordered sunagimo (chicken gizzards), Hatsu (chicken heart), Reba (chicken liver), Gyu Tan (beef tongue), Hotaru-Ikayaki (baby octopus), and Katsu Don which is a panko style deep fried rice with onions, egg and soy sauce.   I ate everything and was so excited to finish it.  Each had a different flavor. I do have to say the gizzards are chewy and likely not for everyone. There were more items on the menu worth a try but it will have to wait till next time.   Overall the restaurant was really nice. Service was good and the food was unique. Will be going back to try more.",

We ordered:  (2) Shrimp Shumai - I was not impressed, I thought it was going to taste and look like the shu mai at a dim sum restaurant, but it wasn't. This is something I wouldn't order here.   Tori Roll - We ordered this because it was on Happy Hour and it was an \"okay\" roll. I probably wouldn't order it again, but I'm glad I tried it.  Salmon Sashimi - My husband loves this. Every time we go out for sushi, this is one of his go to's.  Chicken Heart BBQ skewer - I didn't try it because quite frankly I'm not a big fan, but my husband loved it. He said there was a lot of flavor there.  Baby Octopus BBQ skewer - Very delicious and tender!   Taiwanese Sausage skewer - It was sweet, but not overly too sweet. It was pretty tasty.  Spicy Miso Ramen w/ Pork - The broth was delicious and even better with the chili oil. The only downside for my husband were the veggies. He said there were way too many in the bowl.   Katsu Don Rice Bowl - There wasn't anything too exciting about this bowl. The bowl consisted of rice, breaded chicken, eggs and veggies.   The service was great! Our waitress and even the cooks came by to make sure we were doing okay and that we were comfortable. We'll be back to try other items on the menu.",

I've tried the adventurous foods and the average, I've never been disappointed. I honestly can't tell what authentic Japanese food is because I've never been, but compared to any of the dozen other places I've tried I know this must be as close as it gets. The sashimi is next level, melt-in-your-mouth amazing. The ramen is out of this world. The staff is amazing, friendly and so welcoming. Our favorite waitress knows mine and my boyfriend's orders before we sit (we dine here about once a month at least) and the atmosphere...its just so homey. They play Japanese pop and it really has a feel unlike any other.  I love Dozo Izakaya!",

    "text": "We stopped in for a quick dinner before a movie on a Saturday night. DOZO Izakaya was about half full, quiet, and relaxed. The menu is extensive and it took a while to decide what we wanted. There are starters, Izakaya (skewers), sushi, bentos, and noodles (ramen, udon, yakisoba). We ordered a house salad, assorted tempura, a dynamite roll, and a carburetor roll (tempura shrimp, crab, avocado). My partner got an unfiltered sake. On a whole we were really happy with our food. The tempura was light and crispy. The panko shrimp were especially good. The salad was much larger and of a higher quality than I expected though some of the dressing was a little heavy on wasabi. The dynamite roll was great. We were a little disappointed with the carburetor roll. The eel sauce here is very, very sweet and the roll was sitting in it. Beyond that, more avocado might have lent some fat and texture to a kind of dry roll. The service was friendly though both our plates had spots of dried food on them and we could have used fresh plates after the first few items--a check in would have been good. About half way through our meal, the table next to us got ramen and I got jealous. They offer vegetarian broth and gluten free noodle options. We'll be back to try the ramen.",

Our orders can out at separate times which is odd here in the US but standard in Japan. My Udon was excellent, she loved her Miso Ramen with shrimp. Both orders were very filling we ended up taking some home to leave room for Mochi ice cream. The restaurant was small but nicely decorated. On a saturday evening the place was full. There was plenty of outdoor seating but summer in AZ is not the time for that. Next month in october it should be lovely. Our order took a long time but the staff was attentive and we were not in a hurry. My daughter suggest that we come every month as a bonding thing and order something new each time. I'm all for that idea,",

Looking forward to going back to try the ramen dishes and more of the sushi rolls.  Everyone working there was super friendly and attentive. They also have a good selection of beer, sake and wine. We will for sure be coming here again!  We had a huge lunch with a large Kirin and the bill was only $36.

So once again, another name pops up, \"Dozo\", and I think Here's another ma and pa short-lived business adventure.   Alas, we give it a try tonight, and wow! The decor is well-done, the staff is warm and friendly, and the menu is deep and provocative.  The food: we tried 3 of the izakaya items--chicken skin, chicken hearts, and beef tongue. Interesting, and I will try more, but 4 out of 5 stars. A bit more \"chewey\" than I think it could have been. We then had the carburetor roll. This was outstanding, and the shrimp tempura in the middle had an excellently thin, light, crispy batter. Made us want to try the tempura items by themselves next time. The ramen was also really good, and we'll explore that further as well.  I really hope this place is a continuing success. This is a gem in south Tempe that we need as a local hot spot.  I reserve the fifth star for future visits, only because I like to remain objectively very critical of the truly best places.",

The chirashi looked very appetizing, but the salmon didn't taste fresh at all. As for the Izakaya, they look so much better in the pics on here, so I was pretty disappointed. The sauce they put on top didn't really have much flavors. It just tasted salty.   Service was alright. The waitresses seemed very busy , so I have no issue with the service.",

    "text": "I'll start by saying that the food is excellent here and the price definitely makes it an ever better value.  I was surprised that it was a little slowed on a Friday night but we're told (we just moved to AZ) that a lot of people leave for the summer so the city gets a little lighter.  We ordered a bunch of stuff from the robata menu and our favorite was the chicken wings.  I think the fire might've been a little weak because I would've liked the gyutan (beef tongue) and chicken gizzard sticks to have a little more char on it.  The sushi was really good and I love that they do a pretty good job on the natto roll.  Salmon was really fresh and we liked that the veggie roll was really simple.  The only thing I didn't care for was the server forgot to put in our order for gyutan and for some reason she was trying to make it sound like it was our fault? She brought back our order form and showed it to us which when I guess she realized that it was marked off.  She just said \"oh, I didn't enter that order so I'm going to go order it now\".  No \"sorry\" or apology of any kind.  Again, not really a huge deal for me but turned my wife a little.  I just thought it was an odd way to approach an honest mistake.   Overall, I'm sure we'll be back again.  The food was really good, prices reasonable, and without that little blip in the ordering, it was a great meal.",

    "text": "This is the second ramen place we've tried in about a week. We went to Dozo for dinner with friends and were there at around 7:15pm. They have outdoor seating that was almost empty in comparison to their neighboring restaurant but the restaurant was pretty full on the inside. We were seated immediately and we ordered 4 ramen bowls, 2 Kara aghe, baked scallops and mushrooms, chicken gyoza and a couple of sushi rolls (one of which was a Las Vegas roll). Our friends wanted to order the beef soup and they actually were there particularly to have this dish but the restaurant unfortunately were out. It definitely means this dish is very popular but it's a shame when a restaurant runs out of their top dish on a Friday night. For drinks we ordered sodas, water and I ordered apple juice.   The appetizers started to come out pretty quickly. All the appetizers were delicious. The Kara aghe chicken was just a tiny bit dry but still tasted pretty good.   The ramen bowls and the sushi rolls were served next. Both myself and my husband got a soy broth with chicken. The toppings are standard like the soft boiled egg, the nori, fish cake etc. honestly, we weren't impressed with the bowls. There was no flavor, it was very flat. I added plenty of soy sauce and chili paste and it still didn't do any thing for me. Having tried a more flavorful ramen place in Scottsdale over and over again, this place fell short of delivering on flavor.   I tried one piece of the Las Vegas roll and I didn't like it. The smoked salmon tasted slightly bitter, it didn't taste like the Las Vegas rolls I'm used to.   Prices are average. For what we ordered, the bill came out to around $97 before the tip.   Service is excellent and ambience is nice. Restaurant is pretty small so it can fill up real quick. I wish we had the chance to try the beef soup bowl. We may have had a better experience with our main dish. Overall a 3/5 experience.",

My bento box was very full and good, no doubt about that.  The miso soup I got was not very hot or good. The spicy tuna roll tasted just ok, I was not too happy with that. Overall a so-so experience for me. Portions were large, food was ok, not off the wall good or anything. As one other reviewer said, this is a solid strip mall Izakaya, it provides decent food.

It was filling and it hit the spot. The wife thought her ramen was okay. We've had better so she didn't care too much for her ramen.

They have special vegetable broth and u can have tofu along with it, if u want to do full vegetarian. The food arrived and the broth was delicious, it was more of tomato based, tangy and nice. The ramen was cooked well and it was filling.   I liked the different varieties they have. Their prices are reasonable and costs about $10-15 for a lunch. I definitely want to try other dishes.",

    "text": "Dozo Izakaya is a simple eatery - no fancy izakaya decor here. I think a lot of students frequent this place for the decent food, large portions and quick service. Think of it as your typical strip mall family run joint. On the two visits here, I've tried the ramen, sushi, curry and a few other appetizers. I've noticed quite a few typos on the menu and learned this place is Chinese run, rather than Japanese, so it's not 100 percent authentic (which explains some of the food)   With that said, the miso ramen broth was decent but nothing special. The noodles were pleasantly curly and al dente but a bit too much in portion. They do have a decent veggie option for ramen, so my coworkers like this place.   The curry was not amazing. It was just like the boxed mix with no veggies in it like other restaurants might do, but they did give plenty of the fukujinzuke (red daikon pickles) and you can can add egg to it. The sushi is just okay. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.",

I really liked this place, great variety and the ramen was good!  My wife and I had the lunch ramen combo with the spicy miso and pork.  it was pretty good.  Not the best ramen ive had in the valley but definitely up near the top. we had the gyudon and mapo tofu sides with the ramen and ordered gyoza for our daughter. will be back!",

If you're a fruity drinker like myself, I recommend the Pink Geisha, this drink can be dangerous, it tastes so good you just want more and more. The food was really good. I ordered Gyoza but only got to eat one, as my husband and son gobbled down the rest, I can only assume they enjoyed it. My husband got the spicey Miso soup with chicken, which he really liked because it wasn't greasy like all the other places we've tried. Our son got the regular Miso soup with chicken, he loved it so much he ordered a side of rice so he could mix it with the rest of his broth and finished it. I had the Sho-Yu ramen, also with chicken, I also enjoyed my food very much, down to very lazy drop.  Definitely will be coming back for more of that drink plus, I really want to try their soba!!",

This place isn't just a stand-in for my favorite izkaya places back home, it's a truly authentic Japanese restaurant with a bunch of super tasty dishes that automatically give this place 5 stars. The best part about this place is that they manage to offer a wide variety of menu items without substituting quality. The staff is super nice, the place is really clean, it's conveniently located off Warner Rd, and has plenty of parking. I will definitely be back as I can already tell this will be one of my new favorites in the area.",

Usually you and your buds drink sake or beer and eat a bunch of small snacks to accompany it.  The best snacks to me are items off of the grilled menu (yakitori) - usually chicken skewers.  When paired with an Asahi superdry, something magical happens.  Does this place serve world class yakitori?  No.  But the fact that there is a place in the Valley to scratch this culinary itch is easily worth 4 stars in my book.     My rec:  GO!  With coworkers or friends.  Order a japanese beer (preferably Asahi Super Dry).  Order off of the Yakitori menu - try at least one unusual meat - Beef Tongue is incredible.  Say \"Kanpai!\" a lot.  Drink more beer.",

    "text": "My experience? It was great to start but ended with big disappointment.  When I found out about this place I was ecstatic because there's no izakaya in Phoenix area. Yes, there are sushi and fast-food type places but nothing like izakaya. So, just for that reason I gave it 5 stars.   In our party we had 4 adults and a 19 month old baby. We sat at a table around 5:30pm and the service was soooooo slow it took about 4 hours to get all of our food. We left around 9:30pm. For that reason alone I deducted 2 points.   Cooked food was pretty decent but sushi was not so fresh and tasteless. Sake was overpriced and beer was warm. So, i deducted another point.   This place is also not kid friendly so minus another point. There was no crayons or anything to keep a child busy and there was no changing station in the bathroom either. Luckily the baby was well behaved and didn't get too agitated but other kids in the restaurant were screaming.   We had to ask for our order numerous times and average service time took 20-30 min for each order. One of the dish we ordered was so salty we asked them to take it back.   This places is very small with 3 waitresses and several cooks so you think they have this down but they seemed very confused and customer service was very poor. I understand this is a new establishment but hope they get their act straight so they don't disappoint more customers.   So, where does that 1 star apply you say? Well, all else failed but the tonkotsu ramen was pretty darn good. LOL!",

This isn't your typical sushi joint. It is a style of eating that Japanese go to for happy hour. This is to say it is casual.   We ate delicious 3 sushi rolls, Taiwanese sausage, and a grilled rice bowl. Fish, veggies and fruit was fresh and tasty.   This is such a fun experience because it is a little different. The style is clean and sleak and we look forwrd to sitting outside when the weather is more favorable.",

Unfortunately, the tenderloin was not cooked properly. What should have been a hard, crispy fry was soft--kinda like when you have chicken nuggets that have been frozen and you hear it up in the microwave. The curry on top was exactly as I remember it growing up. Overall, it was a great meal but I had expected the pork to have a nice crisp shell and it did not. However, I'd still recommend them highly!",

The owner or manager was very friendly and brought the menu and some water out while we waited.   It wasn't too long before we had seats open, and since we've been looking over the menu we had a good idea of what we wanted. Unfortunately, we had to wait almost 30 minutes before the waitress took our order. We tried to get her attention several times but she was too overwhelmed with the work. I think they would benefit from hiring another server, at least for the dinner rush.   The food, however, was DELICIOUS! The Cha-shu ramen I ordered was very thick and flavorful, not at all salty like at most other establishments. I also had the yam and avocado roll, and that too was tasty. Their prices are also very reasonable. I would've given 5 stars if not for the snail service.  I will definitely come back, just not around popular meal times.",

Spicy miso ramen with chicken looked like some hot oil was drizzled on the surface. Three eighth inch mini medallions of chicken,  $7.75. So not worth the trip,  left unfulfilled.

I feel like I just ordered food from costco. The chicken tasted just like the Costco ready cooked salad grilled chicken you can buy. It was dry and old chicken. The philly roll had small thin pieces of smoked salmon, like the ones you can buy from Costco. By far, the smallest bento box I've ever had. Salad and miso soup were good though.   Takoyaki. You can play the game \"where's the octopus\" because there is no octopus. And they only give you 4.   Curry ramen was plain and watery today.   Establishment is clean and servers are very polite.   We really tried to like this restaurant. However, I think the quality of the food can be upgraded.",

I usually go to Cherry Blossom in Phoenix for their cha-shu ramen, and it's amazing...but I really wanted s good bowl of ramen with all the fixings. Egg, nori, narutomaki, pickled bamboo, ginger, you name it, I wanted it. This place delivers exactly that!   I ordered the tonkatsu cha-shu ramen. The broth was buttery and had a wonderful garlic taste to it. The noddles were cooked wonderfully (though I still prefer Cherry Blossoms noodles), and the fixings were just a lovely added bonus. This stuff comes so close to the ramen I had in LA last year and it is to die for. The service was great and the staff is friendly. I am so happy I found this place and decided to give it a shot.

She told me that the chef was from Thailand, which probably explains the variety of food items that the restaurant offered. This wasn't a typical Japanese restaurant - they had lots of other menus as well.   Dozo had lots of great interesting appetizers - I tried foods that I wouldn't normally have been able to try in typical sushi restaurants. For example, I saw some beef tongues in the appetizer, but I wasn't daring enough to try. Instead, I had the bacon with okra - I never had okra before but it tasted like a chewier and juicier version of cucumber, for a lack of better description. I highly recommend it - I ended up liking it a lot. I also had the Vietnamese sausage which tasted like a less-saltier version of sausage with teriyaki sauce and a different aftertaste. Lastly, I had the squid dish (sorry I'm blanking on the name) - it was shaped into little balls. I posted a picture for reference, just in case you want to try it - that appetizer was great, too.   I ordered the poki tuna don, which was basically white rice with lots of marinated tuna slices. I loved the sesame flavor. My 10 year old friend like the beef bowl, and told me that the kids' size was perfect for her. The Bento box (chicken katsu) came with lots of food as well, including rice, chicken katsu, salad pieces, and other side dishes.   I will come back again for sure, possibly with family. It has unique concepts, and a really pretty outdoors seating area too.",

    "text": "This was my first time trying Ramen here in AZ. My friend actually recommended it and I've been really craving Ramen.   I ordered the Tonkotsu Cha-Shu Ramen (pork bone broth ) Ramen. This was actually really good, I really enjoyed the broth and it was also a good size bowl of ramen. The only downfall was there wasn't enough meat in it. They only give you 2 pieces of meat. They also have happy hour on Monday-Saturday from 5-6:30 pm. Everything is very reasonably priced for happy hour. Around $3+ for rolls. I ordered the Philly roll, but it wasn't anything spectacular. It didn't taste as fresh. They also have drink specials. Around $4 and up.   I'd definitely come back for happy hour or to have their ramen again, but I would definitely recommend them adding more meat to it, otherwise it tasted great.",

I feel like we have the best service when the middle-aged woman is our server, as she seems to clarify and get our orders correct. We never have any issues with her on the floor and have an enjoyable experience.  We did have an incident where a young server with a thick accent couldn't understand what we wanted (a pork dish) and brought a fish dish (the next item on the menu below it) to someone who was Allergic to fish. Luckily we determined the error before it was consumed, but WE were still penalized for the error and had to pay for the unwanted dish.  But we keep going back for the tori rolls. so...it wasnt bad enough to drive us away completely. Just left a bad taste in our mouth from a customer service standpoint...",

They don't have great menu for happy hour but their menu and price is generally reasonable. Food was really good. We had squeeze with tare seasoning which is soy sauce flavor. Squeeze was surprisingly fresh! Next time I'll try more seafood there. All chicken was delicious. Beef tongue was really really good. Much better than I thought  If you wanna try very Japanese style light food and drinks, I really recommend here!",

I enjoy coming here for dinner for the izakaya menu. The baby squid skewers are hands down my favorite. I would give them five stars, however, they're not really dog friendly. They do accommodate meaning they sat us in the corner of the patio and had us tie our puppy to the outer rail. Other than that, the food is phenomenal and the service is prompt.",

    "text": "\"I've never really wanted to go to Japan. Simply because I don't like eating fish. And I know that's very popular out there in Africa.\"  Britney Spears  Strutted into DOZO on Friday night and walked away content.  Although my actual rating is probably closer to 3.5 stars, I think they're definitely more worthy of 4 stars than 3.  Here are the details:  I ran across this Yelp listing by an off-chance and saw that they offered izakaya/yakitori.  What!?  Is this really in Tempe or am I accidentally looking at a Los Angeles listing?  The outside of the restaurant even has red lanterns like real izakaya joints!  Wee!  After a few weeks of pining, I came here with skewers of yumminess in mind.  We ordered everything I was hankering for:  Chicken hearts, chicken gizzards, chicken livers, beef tongue, chicken cartridge, atka mackeral, fried sweet shrimp, takoyaki, and a pork bento on the side just in case the small bites were really small.  The offal [tongue, heart, gizzard, and livers] were all over-cooked.  I think this is so because the cooks were afraid of serving customers under-cooked meat.  I had been watching the chef the whole time and never once did he leave his grill so I do think it was intentional.  Working in the food industry, I know the pain of customers thinking the chicken could be too raw and not safe for consumption so let's burn the heck outta it.  Next time though, I would ask them to not cook it so well.  The cartridge seemed to be really crunchy things and I'm not too sure if actual cartridge was used but it made for an interesting texture after eating so much rubbery offal.  Skip the salted smoked fish --- nothing special [save yourself $11, folks].  The bento is ridiculously huge with lots of sides but you get a tiny pork cutlet and some not-too-cute tuna rolls with it.  The fried sweet shrimp and takoyaki with bonito flakes were probably my favorite bites of the night.  It was fun playing with the giant shrimps and the takoyaki had generous large pieces of octopus inside.  Yum!  While the service could be better with hiring another waitress/hostess and the wait time for food seems pretty long considering they're \"small bites\" with at least three cooks present, I would definitely be back --- I want to try the ramen.  Everyone here is really nice.  Yes, the owners and staff all speak Mandarin but hey, we're in America folks.  Koreans are making sushi so why can't the Chinese make izakaya?  America is great because we're a melting pot of cultures.  Stop complaining, people!  Why make this a scandal?  Dinner for two came out to be $56 [without tip].  Not bad, DOZO.  Not bad at all.",
