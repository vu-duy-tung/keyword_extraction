My daughter, who dislikes Mexican food, orders the cheese pizza and chocolate milk from the kid's menu (yes, they turn a blind eye and gladly serve the kids' menu to those even a tad older than specified age!).  These, too me, are nothing special BUT, to a 13yo girl, pizza is always #1 choice!  My son and I each order one of the $9.99 2-item combos plates, and only eat 1 of the 2 items on each plate, taking the leftover 2 items, beans, rice home w/us. He orders Lemonade, & I can't pass on the (all day/everyday) .99 cent Margarita. And we order a side of sautee'd vegetables, as I make sure my kids at least have a few bites of veggies at dinnertime.  The food is always fast, hot, and looks better, more authentic, home-made.  With coupon, & 20% tip (yes, 20% tip is BEFORE discount), I am out the door for $37.  Beat that!  Now you know why I keep coming back!  The service is always friendly, and there are some very pretty waitresses there, as well...darn the luck :)",

We first used to go there, quite awhile ago, when the owner would come out, and wait on us.   We've come back, even after moving out of the neighborhood, a few years ago.  They offer up 99 cent margaritas, all day, every day.  Their chips and salsa are so good.  The chips are thin, and probably baked, which means that I eat twice as many!  *wink*  They bring out a bean dip (warm), and a salsa, both of them are very good.  My husband orders Chicken Enchilada dinner (it comes out *sizzling* hot), and I order Shrimp Ranchero Burro.  The shrimps are yummy, nice and plump, and the dnners are presented very attractively.  We used to download a coupon BOGO (buy one-get one free), and order up a few of those 99 cent margaritas.  They still offer up the coupon, but there is no more 99 cent margaritas included.  So today I had a bottled beer, my husband had an iced tea.  The total was under $19.00 -- not bad!  We try to get to Las Glorias about once a month.",

    "text": "I really can't believe I haven't written a review yet for my favorite neighborhood place, Las Glorias. I love this little gem so much: wonderful, homemade food and the warmest and friendliest staff.  My favorites? The bean dip that comes with the salsa is fantastic ... not too spicy but creamy and flavorful. Whenever I feel a cold coming on, I order a large bowl of their chicken tortilla soup. It's so substantial with a good mix of chicken chunks, fresh vegetables, avocado and a savory broth. Does it cure my cold? Nope, but it really does make me feel better! Their fish tacos are my favorite in the Valley and come with whole beans that I could eat an entire potful of. If it's Friday night and my SO and I don't feel like waiting 40 minutes for one of the trendy CenPho dinner spots, we hang out at Las Glorias and get one of their tasty margaritas and their chicken avocado salad with cilantro dressing and pepitas. The man loves that they always have a sports game on TV. I love the super comfy booths and welcoming decor. They also serve a delicious garlic fish (and a few other great seafood dishes) so you don't have to sacrifice healthy eating for a night out. Don't be put off by the strip mall. They'll get to updating it eventually but for now, it houses this lovely little place so I'll take it.",

I called ahead and ordered the chicken fajita burrito and I was there within 10 minutes to pick it up right as it came out of the kitchen.  The burrito came with rice, beans, chips, and salsa. I opted for the Caesar salad for a small amount extra.   The burrito was large and good, served wet with melted cheese with sour cream and guac on the side.  The rice and beans were ok, and the Caesar salad was not worth the extra dollar or so, I'd suggest you pass on that.   The yelp reviews on this place are pretty accurate based on my experience",

But I do get a churro or two off of his kid's meal, which is a ton of food for $5 with dessert.   The staff is friendly and the environment comfortable and generally clean. I say it is the best option for a casual meal in and around the Metro Center.",

    "text": "Yum Yum Yum!  I went to Las Glorias for lunch today with a large group (there were 11 of us) and I always get nervous when dining with so many people.  It's inevitable that someone's order won't be right or service will be molasses-slow...but not here!  After we all ordered, I don't think more than 15 or 20 minutes went by for all of us to get our piping hot, fresh comida - and not one mistake was made - bonus!!  Everyone's dishes looked fantastic and judging by the fact that by the end of the meal not a piece of rice was left on the plate, I would say this place was a hit for everyone.  Let's get to the food!  While we were waiting for our entrees, we all devoured the tortilla and sweet potato (?) chips which were served with both warm bean salsa and a fresh, pico de gallo-like salsa.  Both salsas were perfect and did their job tiding us over until our meals arrived. I was definitely influenced by the fact that New Times rated Las Glorias' fish tacos the best of 2009 so it was a no-brainer for me (and at least 4 of my other dining companions).  The tacos were honestly perfect.  They were double wrapped in fresh corn tortillas (I hate when all of my taco toppings leak through the tortillas so I definitely appreciated the double dose) with perfectly grilled whitefish, crumbly Mexican cheese and shredded lettuce.  There were huge sides of arroz and beans with cheese on my plate which added to the wonderful flavor and filling portion.   And for only $7 this was a serious bargain.  The arroz con pollo, shrimp burros  and other entrees that were ordered around me received major kudos as well.  For dessert, we ordered the flan, churros and lip-smacking fried ice cream which were the perfect way to end the meal.  Who doesn't love a little dessert-tasting, right?  I will definitely be returning to Las Glorias on a Wednesday when they have their 99 cent fish tacos night (and if I recall correctly beers under $1.50).  Hello mid-week deal!",

The salsa was fantastic (always a good sign) and the bean dip was alright but not my favorite.  I love that they have a huge menu of $6 lunch specials.  My waitress told me that the number 7 (2 chicken enchiladas) was the most popular.  I had it with the sour cream and it was absolutely delicious.  The beans and rice were great also, I seen the Wednesday and Thursday specials that everyone was talking about and will have to check those out sometime soon.  The service was good for me but I was the first one there at 10am, I read a few of the negative reviews mentioning that but I enjoyed the experience.  I also thought the atmosphere was really clean and nice, actually was kind of surprised since reviews I read mentioned otherwise.  I don't know what people expect but I was overly impressed with the whole experience.  There was even a flat screen TV and the posters on the wall weren't to much.  I will be back soon.",

    "text": "I went here with my husband last Sunday afternoon.  We had a 2 for 1 coupon out of the Entertainment guide.  We are from San Diego and have been trying to find Mexican food places similar to the food out in San Diego.  We pulled up to the location and were debating if we should go in or not.  The area wasn't the best, and it was in a tiny strip mall.  Kind of looked like a taco shop.  We decide to go in, because we were starving.  Inside it looked completely different.  It was a little dark and dated.  But the atmosphere was very causal and the hosts were super nice.  We sat down and right away got some nice warm chips, salsa and beans served to us.  I was feeling like a margarita and was going to get the house one, when the waitress said they had 99 cent margaritas available.  We ordered our food and didn't have to wait very long to get it.  Super good food and really cheap 99 cent margaritas. The margaritas were served in pretty nice size glasses but a bit strong.  FYI, I think you're getting really cheap alcohol in there, seemed pretty stiff. I started buzzing after my second glass.   My husband even loved the Chile reino that he tried from my plate.  He usually doesn't like it at all.  The carne asada was seasoned very well, it was a great change from some of the bland Mexican food I've had out here in phoenix. My husband had the beef chimichanga and it was seasoned really well also.  For the price you can't beat it.  From the outside the restaurant seems a little ghetto looking, but once you get inside it's pretty nice in there.  I would defiantly try it again.",

Everything I have tried there tastes freshly prepared and full of flavor. Nothing is too spicy and there is so much variety on the menu.

I wish the area was nicer, but the food is so good I don't care.",

    "text": "This Mexican restaurant is in an older and tired strip mall. That's your sign that the food will be good. We've been here twice, and both times we've been impressed. In fact, this time around it seemed like the owners had cleaned up the place a bit.  The first time we came, it smelled a little bit stale and we almost left. This time around, it didn't have any bad smell at all. And the service is fantastic. We got our meals very quickly. When you sit down, you're given chips, salsa, and yummy refried beans.   If you're into seafood and Mexican, this is the place to come. In addition to shrimp cocktail, they also have an octopus cocktail which is closer to ceviche. It has chunks of deliciously boiled octopus. I've had the whole fried fish twice; it's not greasy. It's nice and crispy, the bones are delightfully crunchy. And, it had the head attached. I grew up in a Korean American household where we ate offal. I enjoyed it then, and now.   Their pricing is pretty cheap, considering the awesome seafood options on their menu. The fried fish came with a sizable Caesar salad, rice, and beans for $13.99.",

    "text": "We live within walking distance of Las Glorias, that said, it wouldn't matter where we were coming from... the food is so good we would make a trip for it.  Thankfully we don't have to.   This locally owned restaurant is amazing, beyond the good food the place is comfortable, like many establishments today, it has multiple TV's normally showing sports events. There are also tables and booths out of the visual noise (sound is very low) on the \"tele's\" so you can have a quiet dinner for two or a family dinner for 6 or 8 just as easy.  Like many who come here we love the chips, salsa, and bean dip they bring to the table when you are seated. The chips are crisp and warm, the salsa mild, and the bean dip is a bit warmer.   *** Here is a tip, they have a hot salsa that they will bring to your table on request.   The chips come with the meal and they will refill them as well no charge... It shouldn't be amazing but other establishments charge for this and less.   Over the last two years we have been here many times so let me tell you that we have more than a few favorites on the menu. One of mine is the Carne Asada Combo ($12.99) and the description on the menu doesn't begin to do it justice. The generous portion of grilled marinated steak is True, but then you get to the beans, not the typical refried beans but a bowl of whole beans in served in a yummy broth topped with cheese crumbles. Then there is the enchilada that is everything you would expect. If you are still reading this and you haven't already started to head over... The real treat with this dish, and it used to be on the menu... you can substitute the enchilada with their chili relleno. The plate comes with a grilled pepper on the side with a dollop of guagamole, some pico de gallo to finish it off.    *** Ready for another tip... With all the construction on 19th Ave they have a special that you may not know about. The MetroMax Reward Card will get you one meal free with the purchase of two drinks and another meal of greater or similar value. The card can be printed from the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FWWW.ValleyMetro.org&s=db54bccc9b5da296ca2378a6d7b6d36acdcb27cea57a035d2ee65a9db2a8627b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">WWW.ValleyMetro.org</a> site. They have been doing this special for some time and it doesn't show up on the list participating businesses on the web site... So you have to know... Here is the link to get your own card FREE: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.valleymetro.org%2Fimages%2Fuploads%2Fagency_transitresearch%2FLRT2013_METRO_MAX_PANEL_CARD_Web_English.pdf&s=7b946a291dd774587db1dfcc1268a07f1408332a6043174fc171b7f6bca18b6e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">valleymetro.org/images/u...</a>   Some of the other amazing meals here are the Two Grilled Steak or Chicken Enchiladas, The Camarones Las Glorias are exceptional Cheese stuffed and bacon wrapped shrimp. The Shrimp or Seafood Cocktail will make you think you are at the ocean in Rocky Pointe. The combination meals are terrific values as well.  If you like Menudo, they serve it all weekend... I am a fan.  The only thing we have tried and not been a big fan of is the combination appetizer tray called the Las Glorias Grill Platter. This is a temping item that is not as good as the rest of the menu, having tried it two or three times it just is weak. Not awful but weak in our opinion. Favorite Appetizers would but the Quesadilla with steak or chicken or the Cheese Crisp. The Shrimp Tostada also makes for a good starter for two if you don't mind sharing.  I can go on and on... They have beer, wine and a full bar... the special is a 99 cent margarita available any time they are open.   If your in the mood for a great meal from south of the border, or just a great meal at a great price this place won't let you down. Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner you will be happy to have been here, and thinking about heading back again.",

Everything...and I do mean everything...is so good here! You get complimentary chips and salsa and bean dip. Bean dip is dangerously addictive. Salsa is super fresh.  The size is perfect. Two decently sized enchiladas with sides of refried beans and spanish rice. It's not expensive either for the quality you get.  One of the only complaints I have is that I've been here twice and still don't understand how to check out. I always go up to the stand they have near the back of the restaurant. The other complaint is that it's kind of a small place - especially if you sit in a booth. The first time there, my boyfriend cut his knee open trying to get out of the booth (and no, he's not obese!).  OH. And the parking lot absolutely sucks! It's a nightmare. There's not enough room to park anywhere; hard to back out; hard to turn around; it's in rough shape, too.",

I've only been there once, but the meals were outstanding, and my co-workers assure me about all the other meals I've yet to try are just as good as the Green Chili Burro that I ordered. The meat was good, as well as the sauce. The beans and rice were what you would normally except to get. I wish they had black beans as an alternative to refried beans, but then again - I didn't ask for them either.   To me, the chips and salsa weren't the best. I've had much better chips, salsa and bean dip at other places, but these weren't greasy, so that was good. It didn't keep me from eating a bunch of chips, but I think they were going for major gringo-style on the salsa and bean dip.   I can't wait to try the specially-priced fish tacos on Wednesdays, along with a Corona .. after work.   Service seemed par for the course. Nothing stellar, and a bit slow, especially considering it wasn't that busy at the time.   I can see myself coming back here, again and again.",

Not fancy pants New Mexico style food (you can got o Sierra Bonita grill, also 5 stars, for $25/pp meals).  This place just delivers Mexican Food like the 70's, only better.  Chips are hot and not greasy.  Two kinds of dip.  Their $7 lunch specials are all uniformly good.  Try the chicken quesadilla lunch special if you are feeling bad, or the $8 shrimp enchiladas in jalapeno butter if you are feeling decadent, or grilled chicken salad with tortilla soup (more like stew here) if you are feeling healthy.  On Wednesdays, you must try the best fish tacos in Arizona.  NOT FRIED.  Grilled tallapia type fish, with a little cream sauce, some shredded cabbage, in a corn tortilla.  I go with coworkers and they order 5 for $1.25 each, and along with the chips, they are stuffed to the gills and only spent $5 plus tip.  Seriously... Wednesdays for Fish Tacos.  Remember.  Even if you aren't usually a fan of fish tacos.  It's tacky decorations.  It's cheap vinyl booths.  And the service is not terrific (secret... if you are in a rush, bring your bill to counter to pay, don't wait at the table).  In a city of good Mexican food, if you are looking for entrees less than $12, there is no better Mexican food in Phoenix.",

The food is good,  I usually get a combination plate. It's your typical Americanized Mexican food. My husband usually gets the red chile which he compares to his nana's. He craves it every now and then, and I certainly don't mind joining him. It's good food, and the service is always top notch.",

It isn't so high end that it constitutes a hidden gem, and despite having low prices,  I feel you can get better quality of food for a comparable price.   The  complimentary chips with salsa and bean dip were incredible. And the margaritas were a great buy ($4-8 for a huge drink) But all the entrees were simply ok. They lacked any appreciable spice or flavor. The dishes weren't bad, just bland. That said, they absolutely give you massive quantities - it is easily the best kids menu deal I've seen (six slices of cheese enchilada, a generous portion of rice and beans, a drink, and a dessert of ice cream and churros).  But what really gets the low rating is the service. The waiters were friendly, but it took forever. The dinner lasted two hours and that was simply because we were not checked on with any consistency. It took us over half an hour to get anyone to come take our order. And several requests to re-fill water before it happened. The cook time was very long too. I wanted to order a to-go entree for my wife at home, but ultimately skipped it due to the incredible wait time.",

It was equivalent to like 7-8 drinks for only $16. It tasted really good and was decently strong. They have a lot of drink specials which makes this place a plus if you want to grab a drink with your meal.   The servers were polite on the most part. The place is really big and can seat 20+ parties. Only reason why I'm taking off a star is because the restaurant could be a little cleaner.",

Both hubby and friend got enchiladas and they were super cheesy and saucy! I ordered Alfredo's Combo? Which was seriously so buttery and well seasoned. It's steak, sauteed shrimp in a jalapeno butter sauce over rice with a side of beans and side of corn or flour tortillas.

    "text": "Easily one of the Best Mexican Restaurant in the Greater Phoenix Area, especially for the money.  SERVICE Always friendly, fast, and very accomodating. There is not host/hostess in this restaurant. So, servers will seat you although you can seat yourself if you don't mind waiting for your server.  I have been there many times and unless they're quite busy i never wait for a refill on beverages or chips and salsa. They are not always the most thoughtful servers, but always very accomodating to your requests.   FOOD Always hot, fresh, and higher quality than most mom & pop mexican hole-in-the-walls. i have yet to find something i didn't like on the menu. However, i do reccommend any item with steak -- their steak is so favorful. Absolutely excellent!  They do offer several kinds of salsas. They usually bring out a bean salsa and your typical mexican tomato salsa. Both are good, although most of my friends and I find the bean salsa to be superior and more unique than most restaurants in this category. Also, they do make a darn good Horchatta as well.  The value of food for your money is superb! Most items do not cost more than $10. The amount of food you receive is above average, not ridiculously large, but on the more generous side. Plus, as i remember i've never been nickel and dimed for extra sides of sour cream, pico de Gallo, etc. except for maybe cheese and guacamole which is understandable (even then, i didn't pay any crazy extra amount).  AMBIANCE For being a hole-in-the-wall in a small shopping center in not the greatest of areas in Phoenix the decor is simple, mexican, and welcoming. Their restaurant is always clean from what i've seen. Bathrooms are nothing special by any means, but pretty well kept.",

I found this place because of Yelp. I am new to Phoenix and probably going to be gone from Phoenix all too soon so hopefully I can add a fifth star before I go. I walked in and it is a tiny lil dumpy place in a strip mall as most things are in Phoenix. I sit and the chips and salsa are good but the bean dip they serve with it is out of this world. The free part is awesome so what can I expect for the entree. I reviewed the menu but then was offered the lunch menu which is served until 3pm. I decide to order the fish tacos which are made with Red Snapper and a white sauce. Delicious!! not spicy, but mild and very tasty. It is served on one piece of corn tortilla and served with rice and charro beans. $6.99+tax. Can't beat that either. I was loaded and with tip I was out of there for $10 and a happy tummy. I plan to go back again. I must say this was my fiorst pleasant experience with food in Phoenix. I have been hard pressed to find good food here. Being from Austin and a lover of Houston, I have high expectations for my taste buds and this city has left me disappointed .. until Las Glorias. You must Go. UPDATE 5/12/2011: FIVE STARS. I had the Shredded chicken tacos today. Cannot wait to return and try a full menu entree this weekend.",

They were great about bringing out chips with salsa and bean dip and refilling drinks.  The second time I came the service was horrible.  We were there for over 1.5 hours because we had to wait for EVERYTHING and it was not very busy.  I was not impressed with the food.  They seem to put raw onions in everything, including the cheese enchiladas.  I really dislike raw onions and am a pro at finding dishes without them, but you cannot escape them here.  The rice and beans were good, but I cannot say much else for a positive about this place.  I will not be back!",

My boyfriend likes the green chicken enchiladas and I have gotten a variety of things all turned out good. I once ordered the taquitos and they were over cooked but besides that no complaints.

I had to pay tax not only for the $7 lunch plate but also the entree I got free! So I paid nearly double the tax (ripoff) especially the tax for something I didn't order. How does that figure?

The  server was uninformed regarding the margaritas.  She was confused by the request for one of the 3 different types of tequila listed on the sign on the wall. The  next server told me the  sign advertising  99 cent margaritas was old and hadn't been removed.  I  asked for management;  I was told \" he\" was busy  making a big platter, and could not speak with me.  I persisted.  When she returned from the  kitchen she  said \"he\" would be out later.   I was left standing at the  service bar.  Then 2 servers rolled their eyes at me giggling as they scurried away.  Later, a man (he didn't introduce himself) came to the  table.  He said he would not be able to sell us  blue tequila margaritas as posted on the sign because it was too expensive.   He  showed me a bottle of an expensive blue tequila from a different company that was not the same thing as the sign with pictures and words listing white, gold, and blue tequilas.  He told us he was personally making my blue margarita, and bringing it to the table.  Never happened.  What is going on in this place?  It was the best neighborhood restaurant.  Now I'm not recommending it to anyone because of terrible customer service.  Embarrassed? They  should be.",

Inside the walls are decorated with trappings of concerts past and fundraising events long since past. The hostess was very prompt and polite and guided my party and I to a large table center the room, and we had chips and salsa before we knew it. The menu was standard mexican fair with a lafge tequila selection. The waitress was polite and punctual allowing us time in between drinks and dinner selections.

    "text": "If you are looking for good authentic Mexican food, this is the spot. My family has been coming here for years. It's one of those places my long time separated parents can even agree on!   For starters, the chips and salsa are really very good. This time the bean salsa was a little runny but it is usually really thick and spicy! (TWSS) The other salsa is good too. But the bean dip takes the cake.   This last time I had the menudo. You can tell it is fresh and not made from a can like some places. YUM! and they bring you this lazy susan full of menudo fixins! The large is really very extremely large. I suggest that unless you are a glutton for punishment or a growing boy, order the small. It's just enough. My favourite dish here is the Vallarta fish tacos... So fresh and delish! I usually order a fish taco a la carte no matter what I am eating. It's my favourite thing here. The fish is really light and flaky and fresh. The salads here are really yummy too! My mommy and I sometimes split the chicken and avocado salad and some tacos. Oh and the arroz con pollo and Alfredo's combo (carne and shrimp in this jalepeno sauce), my brother always orders one or the other and I always steal a nibble or two... just fantastic! My pops love the chorizo and eggs from here. It's never greasy or fatty. Really high quality chorizo.   I don't know what it is about Mexican restaurants. They want to clear your plate before you finish you food! LOL Seems like it happens to us a lot here. We always have to say \"oh, I'm not done with that\" lol.   On the positive, I am pretty sure they refill your horchata for free. At least I have never noticed a charge for it.",

You just had to stand around and wait for someone to bother seating you in one of the open booths.  Everyone was satisfied with their meal.  I've had the spinach tacos, which were very tasty, and I appreciate having a veggie option that wasn't a run-of-the-mill bean and cheese or chile relleno.  (I've had their chile relleno and wasn't impressed by it.)  But no one refilled our drinks the whole time or checked on us.  Not even once.   Maybe this is better when you go at a less busy time, but the food isn't mindblowing enough to make it worth the lousy service on a Friday night.",

Oddly enough, living in Arizona it is hard to find really good Mexican food (who woulda thunk, but it's True). I have to say the food at this place is very good, some of the best Mexican food I have had in AZ. I have had the fish tacos (fresh and tasty) and a chimichanga (is that even traditional Mexican?) and it was delicious. The chips and salsa are very good, but the bean dip is out of this world.   The atmosphere is perfect for a Mexican Restaurant. It's nothing you need to dress up for, but it's not run down by any means. It's a good place to go with the family or a special someone for a good meal or even with a group of friends for a good time with a little green liquid help with salty rims.   Cheers",

This little hole in the wall has all the right signs as you walk in the clientele is made up  of a wide slice of phoenix from  your  people on office lunch breaks , abuelas  with their famillias  and average types like myself.  We ordered seafood inspired Mexican food like shrimp enchiladas  , fish tacos (good but nothing to start a talk thread about )  and sopa de mariscos ..very tasty!   The chips were very fresh and the guacamole and salsas mucho yummo.     word of warning they put a jalepeno butter on just about every entree, for those that dont know oil  spreads the heat in peppers ..so your food is spicy! I will definitely be back again  to try the sopa again .",

If that wasn't bad enough-they accused me of skipping on the bill that night and then charged me for both times the next time I came in, even though I didn't sign the second charge.

What we love:   Fresh chips and salsa, and the bean dip served with is dee-lish   BIG, CHEAP Margs. Try the Mango, Peach, Mango/Peach. :)   Fish Tacos. I had never had them before and they were very good. On Wednesdays they are only $0.99!   Great enchiladas, cheese crisps, and pork tacos as well   Friendly service. The servers are always impressed (or act that way) when Nico uses his Spanish on them.   It's nothing fancy or will win any interior decor awards, but we love coming here for a fun experience and always get out of there without spending a ton of dough. Muy bien!",

There was no wait and we were the last ones to come in just before closing. I was a bit worried since it was a party of 8 and it was so late but we basically ended up with the 2 servers to ourselves after the rest of the customers left.   99 cent margaritas all summer!! WTH and they were not in miniature glasses either!! OMG I saw customers with mi cheladas and other giant margs. Their chips were fresh and hot not greasy or salty. The salsa could have used more bite to it but the kids enjoyed it as well as the bean dip that I couldn't stop eating.   My friends son had the waitress's wrapped around his finger they were very attentive and kept stopping to get kisses from the little guy. The men had the carne asada plates that were ginormous and left nothing behind. I had the enchiladas suiza's and my partner in crime had the fajitas. Mine was good there wasnt really any heat to it but the chicken was cooked perfect. It was all really good I cant wait till I'm hungry again for leftovers. The little ones had pizza's and fries it kept them entertained and their meals included ice cream for dessert. I was really impressed by how nice the staff was way after closing time and they never made us feel like we needed to hurry. They made sure the margs were constantly flowing. The menu had everything but tamales I think. I will be going back to try this hibiscus infused marg it sounded delish!! Party of 8 the bill came to $107 not bad at all!   P.S. If you happen to like Coronas they are $1.25 on Tuesdays.",

I was a little hesitant because the places he has mentioned in the past as being his usual haunts usually don't agree with me but I was actually surprised.    Now, the part of town is a bit sketchy and the interior is nothing fancy but the quality of food and the prices were right in line with what I wanted.  I decided to be safe and get the Taco Salad with Chicken Lunch Special (since I had a bad experience with Los Olivos only a few days ago).  They actually give you large strips of flavorful, tender chicken.  The chips were yummy and they offered 2 salsas. One was a bean style salsa that was mild and the other was a standard medium flavored.  The wait-staff was polite and quick on the refills (I am a big water drinker) so I appreciate the promptness.    I probably won't go out of my way to eat here but if in the neighborhood I will certainly stop by for a quick, tasty, and affordable lunch.",

I must say I have never been impressed by rice though however I have now seen the light!  Their rice was flavorful, fluffy, and I ate all of it.    The drinks aren't lacking either!

Both very good!   First of all the chips salsa n bean dip they give you is amazing!! I finished the entire basket of chips w the bean dip!! N I hardly ever eat or enjoy beans.   As my main I got the arroz con camarones (shrimp instead of chicken) and my husband got the fajitas supremas which came with shrimp, steak and chicken w side of rice and flour tortillas. I even got one carne asada taco to try cuz I love my tacos!! Ok this is where I gave them 5 stars! Everything was delicious!! N the price point!! Can't complain!!  I will definitely b back to try other items!! And this is my new favorite Mexican restaurant!!",

Much to my delightful surprise this little hole in the wall place is diamond in the rough.   We came for breakfast and ordered chilaquiles with eggs and skirt steak and was DELICIOUS. AGAIN, DELICIOUS! The sauce contained the right amount of heat, the steak was nicely seasoned and cooked and the refried beans tasted made from scratch. Everything was good and our little boy ate all of his egg and bean plate too!  Only qualm is the prices could be a bit more reasonable as you are not paying for the dining experience considering the location it's in.

I typically get my meal 'to go' these days. They even pack up the chips, salsa and that amazing bean dip for my take out orders. My favorite meal is the spinach enchiladas.

We live in Texas so I've become a bit of a mexican food snob only wanting the best (doesn't matter if it's fancy or hole in the wall).  I found Las Glorias looking at online reviews and boy it didn't disappoint!  Don't be fooled by the storefront.  The food is amazing!  The corn tortilla seem like it's homemade and just nothing I've ever tasted.  It's goood!  The salsa had a great flavor but I'm used to the hottest of salsa so it was a bit disappointing and they don't have anything hotter unless it's habanero sauce.  The fajitas was very delicious and nice sized portions! It was so good we contemplated eating there a second time on our vacation.  Whether you're a traveler passing by or you live in the area, GO TO THIS PLACE!  It's extremely good!",

We both started out with an horchata. The drinks were huge! They were tasty too so double win! Every table gets chips with salsa and a bean dip. The salsa was whatever, but the bean dip was so good that we had to ask for a second one. The bean dip was creamy, slightly cheesy, and had a very subtle spiciness to it. The chips where on the thinner side and were crispy.  For my entree, I ordered the Las Glorias mini chimis. It's two small chimichangas with a side of rice and cheesy beans. It also comes with a scoop of guac and sour cream. The chimis came one as chicken and one as beef. I feel like they were fried and immediately placed on my plate because by the time they made it to me the bottom of the chimi was a little soft moving towards soggy. The top was crispy and really nice though. The meat inside was good. They were not the best I have ever had though.  The cheesy beans were delicious. They had a similar flavor profile to the bean dip. The bean dip was definitely better. Both were good though. I didn't eat the rice at all. I'm currently trying to avoid eating rice.",

Walked in to order some tacos and the lady said hold up and left us there for 10mins. So we started looking for someone seen a young lady in a black shirt and as she walked pass us we kept saying excuse us excuse us well we said this so many times and customers looking at us. So my cousin said just forget it he wasn't going to spend his money in there. I went back in to ask questions about way everyone avoided us and they were not nice and pretended that I was the one crazy. That's ridiculous and just awful. Thanks a lot for this.",

The restaurant is located at a small strip mall and parking can be limited at times especially during lunch time. There is parking in the back which allows you to enter from the rear of the restaurant. The place was busy and it's Friday. Las Glorias has weekly specials Monday through Friday, during the lunch hours. The ambience of the restaurant is not modern, with Mexican style music playing in the background. At this restaurant you are always seated immediately but, don't expect that on a Sunday, it gets very crowded during lunch. In the past I have I ordered other items from the menu just to try something different. Today I was in the mood in ordering their carne asada tacos. The carne asada is flavored with onions, cilantro, tomatoes, and seasoned just right. My better half ordered her usual the green chili burrito. Overall their food is good and it's frequented by the locals that live in the area who are regular customers. Their service is always very good and if you want your order done a certain way just tell them and they will try to appease you. If you happen to be nearby stop by and try it. This is my first review of this restaurant.",

My husband and I decided to finally try here tonight when we wanted mexican food.  It was DELICIOUS!  We usually go to places like Garcia's, Manuel's, and Macayo's but I think that will be ending now that we have eaten here.  The chips, salsa, and bean dip were brought out to us very quickly along with our drinks.  The chips were very fresh with just the right amount of salt on them.  The food was brought out pretty quickly thereafter.  I ordered the shrimp enchilada and my husband order a beef chimichanga.  The chimichanga looked like it  was lightly fried - just to the right level of fried.  The shrimp enchilada was probably the largest enchilada I have ever seen.  The shrimp were large and the amount of them in the enchilada was very generous.  The flour tortilla used for the enchilada was very light and tasty.  Both entrees came with rice and beans.  I would say that the rice was right on par with what is made in other restaurants but I believe that the refried beans are better here.    The service was prompt and very attentive (unlike previous experiences at other restaurants).  I would definitely recommend coming here instead of going to any of the more familiar chains out there!",

The enchilada sauce is perfect, the enchiladas themselves are stuffed full and satisfying, and their refried beans are the perfect amount of spicy. Their green chile is super yummy too.  Chips are always hot, the salsa is good, and service is always friendly. If they're busy they might take a little extra time to get your bill to you, but they always keep the glasses full and the food always comes out promply. One of my biggest pet peeves is when my drinks don't get refilled, and that they always stay on top of that here.   The decor isn't fancy, but it is clean. Don't let the strip mall outside scare you -- it is cozy and yummy inside!",

This is where my opinion goes way down. The flavor was good but the meat was really tough and full of gristle. I could not eat about a 1/4 of it. I mentioned this to my server and she just nodded and went on about her business. No I sorry or anything. This is why I am writing this poor review. Even if you been in business for a long time you will not get new customers this way. I will go by to my standby places not here again.",

    "text": "I've seen this place all the time but never went because I knew of other Mexican restaurants that I know are good. But my dad has been eyeing it and since he's paying he decided where to go.  First we stood at the front for 5 minutes waited to be seated. 1 waitress was delivering drinks to a nearby table, glanced at us, and kept on going. No greeting, No be right there, completely ignored. So we got to eye the diners food who were seated near by while we waited.  Finally we were seated. Another 10mins role by, passed by several waitress until our drinks we're taken. I told the lady we were ready to order and she said okay...and walked away. Really?!  I ordered an Horchata and a black coffee. I got a very thin milky horchata and coffee with cream on the side. Another waitress came and took our order. We got complimentary chips salsa and refriend beans as we waited. When our meal arrived about 15mins later, I returned my horchata because it was mostly water. After I was half way done with my meal, I finally got the water I asked for when I returned the horchata. Oh, when I returned the drink thats when she decided to tell me that the machine is down and \"their working on it.\" If that was the case I would've ordered something else to begin with.  My meal was 2 talapia tacos, rice and beans with a ceviche tostada on the side. The fish tacos were good, not great but good - same with the beans. The tacos had a tblsp of chopped lettuce and tomato's. I didn't touch the rice. After I finished my meal I asked about my tostada because that never appeared. 5mins later it arrived. The ceviche was piled on top of the tostada, so I had to eat half of the ceviche before I can even pick up the tostada. THAT was delicious.  Dad got a side of beans, a cheese enichilada and over easy egg. First he was disappointed because he didn't get a tortilla with his meal. Each of my taco's came with 2 corn tortillas, so I handed him one of those to keep him happy while we waited for the waitress to happen by. One waitress came and he asked for a sopapilla. She said okay and another waitress came back to us asking about it. They didn't understand that all he wanted was bread to dip into is bean and egg. He even switched to Spanish in the hopes of getting a better understanding of what he wanted. It usually comes with honey and powdered sugar but he had to explain again, all he wanted was the bread. ONE. So 5mins later she came back with 4.   He didn't care for his meal. The refried beans weren't the greatest, the cheese enchilada was made from the can and the egg had too much yolk for his liking. He barely touched it. He did eat some of my rice I didn't want.  All in all, it won't be some place I would be returning. When I crave Mexican seafood, I'll go to Marisco's.  The one good thing, it looks really small from the outside - but it's nice and big inside.",

There were only 2 other occupied tables in the place. Gorgeous servers, but they didn't care about us gringos and I felt dismissed, ignored, resented and stiffed.

I love a happy server!! Very quick to bring out chips and salsa AND beans! What a treat! Beans with your chips, winner! I split a cheese crisp and shrimp fajitas with my boyfriend.

So on that note 3 more group of peeps show up b4 closing like 10 minutes prior. My tacos were expensive and they were tiny and the tortillas used was fuken stale ass hell with no flavor at all on the asada or the fish, then i had a shrimp ceviche and hell that shyt was horrible worst I'd ever tasted, then the horchata was just watered down even am/pm had better horchata n they're shyt sux but compared to this place yah..no! Got my son an ice cream wit churros n the chorros were also stale, smh! The absolute worst mexican restaurant i have ever been to, never again will i eat at this place.  Thats just my opinion, and i dont bullshyt when it comes to food, i tell it for what it is..bout the only thing good that came out of this dinner was the server kept coming to my table to check on us which is a plus, so service wise it was good.

I don't need the atmosphere to be amazing I don't need the waitress to make sure I'm fine I have a wonderful family to keep me occupied. So with that in mind I would have to say this place has the best Tamale and food  in town. It is a difficult task to make me happy with a tamale soooo many restaurants mess em up and this place makes em deeeeelicious. Enchiladas..... deeeeelicious!! The salsa deeeeelicious!!! 1.99 margaritas??? Come on!!!! it doesn't get better than than that. I would give them 10 stars if you could. If your looking for atmosphere or service at a 1-2 stars price then stay home. But this place is the best Mexican Food in Phoenix",

It looks smaller from the outside than it is inside. It's clean and the decor is inviting with a Mexican theme of course.  We were welcomed and seated right away. Our server was prompt to bring chips and salsa and to take our drink order. The menu has a good selection. We decided on the Shrimp Salad appetizer for me and the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp for my friend.   The food came out fairly quick and looked great! The Shrimp Salad appetizer looked and tasted delicious! It had cucumbers, tomatoes, red onion, avocado, cilantro and shrimp tossed in lemon juice!  I renamed it Cerviche Salad because it has almost all the same ingredients and had the same flavor! The bacon wrapped shrimp was cooked just right. It came with rice and beans and sauteed veggies.  We also ordered a couple $1 margaritas. They were perfect for lunch and very flavorful!  This place rates excellent for service, prices, atmosphere and food!",

He also ordered street tacos (lacking guacamole and would not order again) and half an order of oysters (were brown instead of the usual white). I ordered the combo #9 (enchilada and chile relleno) which was horrible. The tortilla was hard and the chile egg batter was super thick and breaded, it tasted like a sponge. I also ordered menudo which was cold but it was good. The lemons they bought us looked like they'd been in the fridge for a couple days. The customer service is not the best. We waited for about 15 minutes when we were done to ask for the check because our waitress was in the back. Overall I would not come back and I wouldn't recommend.",

We got our meals to go and didn't have any problems except menu on line has different prices than on menu at restaurant. Also, did not like chicken thigh in chimichanga would have preferred shredded chicken breast. My friend got shrimp enchiladas but it didn't have cream sauce it was more of a tomato based sauce. Another got red chili burro said the meat was juicy but, sauce was okay.  Overall not a bad spot. Would like to try more dishes here.",

    "text": "Today was an adventurous day for my family, and myself. We were craving some delicious Mexican food, so I hopped on yelp to check out some of the best Mexican eateries. The reviews for Las Gloria's Grill are what set us in that direction. We pulled up to the parking lot, but there were only 2 cars in the lot. A little skeptical at this point, but it was also muggy out. We walked in and sat/stood waiting almost 10 minutes before even being greeted. We sat down for a good 5 minutes when a regular walks in with a humongous pit bull. Now, I'm a dog lover, so I got a bit happy when I saw him. However, we did not go out for dinner to be eating next to a dog, and his overly intoxicated owner. We politely asked to move tables, and I spoke with the guy to ensure him that his dog was not a threat. We moved tables and one of the women brings over some bean dip. Her finger was covered with beans, and resting over our salsas as she carried them - She didn't look presentable. Next, our drinks came. The most tasteless 'frozen' and 'on the rocks' margaritas we've ever tasted. This is when we decided that we'd rather not taste their food, politely called the waitress over to let her know. No hard feelings, I just know where not to go!   From here, we went to La Santisima Gourmet Taco Shop, but didn't eat there. That's a different story in itself.   We finally found a GREAT SPOT for some Mexican food and margaritas @ Don Ruben's Mexican!!! Great food, great drinks, and damn good service!!!",

Waitress was attentive and refilled our drinks without us having to ask.  The chips that come to the table are still warm and taste homemade.  The sauces they are served with are both flavorful - the warm bean dip is the best and the salsa is fresh with just the right amount of spice.  Main courses ordered: pork carnitas, shrimp enchilada with a cheesy cream sauce, and sizzling shrimp fajitas.  Everything came out quickly and very hot.  All of the food was flavorful and everyone was extremely pleased.  We all left way too full!  To top it off, they have 99 cent house margaritas everyday - you cannot get any better than this place!",

Their fajitas are a favorite - the Suprema (chicken, beef, shrimp) is big enough for two. Ask for extra tortillas if you're going to share.   They also have some of the best chips and salsa in town, and they are served with an awesome bean dip.",

    "text": "I've been coming to this little spot for years now!! Its fantastic!! The secret is Taco Thursday! My family and I often make our way in on Thursdays for there taco special!  Dollar tacos and dollar house margaritas!! I mean how can you beat that?! For this special you get to choose between 3 taco options... Carne asada (my favorite) Beef Taco (only one that comes on a crispy shell) and the Fish taco (Yummmm). The margaritas are small but powerful! if you want something on the healthier side go for the fish taco with no tortilla its still awesome because the fish is always fresh!   The nice cute as a button ladies (all of them are wonderful) greet you with a smile and as soon as you sit down they bring over some chips and salsa but my favorite part is the AMAZING bean dip! ooooooh soooo good I could drink it! The cheese crisps are also to die for they come with green chilies (not spicy) so they give it a little something extra (sooo delish).  Another must try is there Tortilla Soup! Its hearty and full of think chunks of veggies including avocado! Great for someone who's not feeling so great (a touch of nani's cooking does the body good!!)    Cecilia is they most amazing server ever and I'm pretty sure my family would adopt her (basically has) if they could! She is seriously amazing its come to the point where we don't even have to tell her want we want to eat because she knows our order like the back of her hand! Shes always aware of whats going on in the entire restaurant and is always on her A-game!!!  We love our Cici!",
