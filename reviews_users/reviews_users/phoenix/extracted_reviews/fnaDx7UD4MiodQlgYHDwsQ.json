The mushrooms looked canned and the chicken in the hot & sour soup was oddly rubbery.  This place over Americanizes their food and it makes me miss east coast Chinese.  We're keeping our hopes up that we'll find \"our\" Chinese take out place in Phoenix, but the outlook isn't good if Dragon Palace is worthy of 4 stars! One up side: ridiculous amount of food for a really good price.",

    "text": "Best Chinese I've had in a long time! This place was recommended to us by the owner of Hammered Hog, and I don't think I will try another Chinese place in the Valley. The service was excellent, fast, friendly and patient (sometimes I take a long time to decide what I want to eat). The food was outstanding. The Won Ton soup had excellent flavor and lots of Shrimp! I ordered the Happy Family - a favorite of mine from when I lived in NY. This is the first place I have found in the 16 years that I have lived in Phoenix that actually makes it like they do back East. My son ordered the Mongolian beef - another perfectly prepared dish. Dave got the House Special Chicken -great flavor - crispy and juicy. I also love Fried Rice - again, great flavor, huge portion. All the portions were large, the price was reasonable and the service absolutely fantastic! The only downfall - no delivery. :-(   They have been in business for 33 years - and I know why they will continue to be there for another 30!  I suggest you go there now!",

I think I had my birthday dinner here for at least 10 birthdays in a row. Nothing changes in Dragon Palace-- the menu, the decor, the workers all seem stuck in a time warp in the strip mall's corner. But that's what makes it awesome! I will always remember the teal walls and the red booths.   Ok, enough reminiscing. Food- you should get the hot bean curd. It's listed in the vegetarian section, which is a total lie because it involves a lot of pork. But man it is tasty, and spicy! Tofu magic! The mushu vegetable wraps with plum sauce are also delicious and a waiter will come to your table and make them for you, which is fun to watch. Also, the free tea is awesome! It just adds to the whole experience.   Definitely a long time Phoenix establishment, don't be fooled by the boring outside, go check it out!",

Then came the entrees, pork fried rice was just ok (some rice not fully cooked at the bottom of the plate) Crispy duck .... $13 entree to get a bunch of pieces of over fried duck put on a plate, mostly fried skin and bones. They cut the bites with the bones in it, so you either have to pull the meat off or spit the bones chunks out as you're chewing on it... I was so disappointed after a good start with the appetizers. Won't go back, overpriced. Still on the hunt for a good Chinese food place.",

    "text": "Let me just say I am not going to use words like throw-back( except I am spelling it correctly unlike our reviewer down below...) or retro to describe Dragon Palace. Let's be honest and say that it has looked just about entirely the same since the place opened, about 30 years ago.   More positively I get greeted like family upon entering,( and I'm not Chinese either - Im a Korean who does not eat Korean food, and there's no inside jokes with the owner)  the service seems to always be good. I have grown up eating at this restaurant for years and can even remember being a little kid and craving their egg rolls. So good.   For those that were disappointed, did you forget that everyone on yelp thinks they are the next up and coming food critic and is extremely opinionated about their experience throwing in the quintessential yelp review words such as ambience or atmosphere all the while possibly mistaking outdated decor for intentional sarcasm? Or are you a picky eater? Or did you expect an overseasoned dish ala PF Chang's?   The food here is plain and simple. The bathroom is clean but could also be mistaken for one in a dive bar as well. The water in the bathroom faucet is insanely hot as the handwritten note warns.I am quite the drinker, but I don't go here for my drinks. I go here for delicious and salty Chinese food. I love the hot tea here, so my cocktail can wait until later.   Go for lunch, it's ridiculously affordable. You will leave full.   This is what I order:   (I don't mind that there is a small sized splash of what appears to be soy sauce on the zigzag border that sits just above the wood paneling in the booth. It seems like it has been there since my 10th Birthday anyway)    Egg drop soup. I like a thicker broth, this is the best. It gets better when you take your first bite  and there are fresh veggies like onion, red bell pepper and tofu in the soup. The fried wontons they serve with it make it even better. If I order egg drop soup anywhere else I immediately regret it, and crave this. It is definitely more egg-y than watery, but that's how I like it.   I only eat egg rolls from here. The wrapper is fried to crisp perfection Their hot mustard is the best anywhere in my personal opinion.   House Special Chicken( all white meat for only 50cents) Crab puffs, Shrimp and Snow Peas, Lemon Chicken, Almond Chicken, and The Mongolian Beef, are some of my most favorites, and they are safe bets.   Also, it says they don't cater, but my Dad just got remarried and they let us order enough food for 100 people with advance notice which was really nice.",

    "text": "My wife and I tried takeout at Dragon Palace a few weeks ago and were really pleased. We ordered one of their specials, the house beef, and it was AWESOME! It honestly got better with every bite and we talked about it for days. We also got the hot n sour soup but frankly it was neither hot nor sour, but somewhat tasty (wouldn't order again).  We went back the other night and dined in and got the happy family---which was delicious and the seafood in it was cooked to perfection---and the Mongolian beef, which was also tasty and tender. We also tried a couple more soups and neither of us loved any of them---just missing something. Probably stay away from the soups going forward to focus on better stuff.  I love spicy food and my request for a chili sauce or hot sauce was answered with a funky paste of mostly seeds that had absolutely zero heat level to it---and I mean zero. I just wanted something like sriracha to kick it up and they apparently don't have that and in my opinion should.  Everyone was polite and friendly, and the owner (assumed it was the owner) walked around and asked how things were and thanked us---which by the way---many \"fine dining\" restaurants fail to do and it is so simple and leaves an impression.  We will definitely return to Dragon Palace. It's not PF Chang's in terms of atmosphere but when you want good food and don't feel like a big hassle this is the place.",

I got sesame chicken and wasn't impressed with that either.    To top it off, the family that owns the place let their small child run around the entire restaurant and in and out of the kitchen screaming, with the teenaged hostess (also a family member) hardly bothering to try to quiet her down.  The waitress just went and sat at a table next to the kitchen staring at me the whole time.  What the heck?  Atmosphere gets a zero.",

    "text": "5 Stars for \"Old School\"   Americanized Chinese food, in an authentic  funky retro Chinese restaurant environment.  Fresh, flavorful, and priced right.    My husband and I were sans children, and wanted something close to home, but different than our usual haunts.  Based on the Yelp reviews, I decided to give Dragon Palace a try.    What a great find!  I have seen this place before, when at the Quiltz shop at the end of the little strip center.  I am glad to try any hole in the wall or oddball place, but having had too much bad Chinese in the past, will usually not try one unless it comes with a recommendation by someone.    Hot tea and ice water arrived immediately.  We ordered 2 Dragon Dinner Specials- I the Almond Chicken, my husband the Mongolian Beef.  Evil, delicious little crunchy fried wonton strips showed up after we placed the order.  The Wor-Wonton soup arrived first- hot, and delicious. Beautiful clean shrimp were so flavorful, and the veggies and wontons were perfect.    The eggrolls were crisp and fresh.  The chicken drumette was crisp and flavorful.   Our entrees were so good, reminding me of the old fashioned Chinese restaurants I went to with my parents in late 60's-early 70's.  (Anyone remember Toy's Shangri La??)       Service was pleasant and non-obtrusive.  Here's an observation I made:  there was NO HINT of anything that had been frozen and added back into any dish.  I hate it when places do this!  The only downside was that we got NO banana wonton desserts!  I think it was because we arrived around 8:15 and they closed at 9, and were closing up the kitchen.  Now we HAVE to go back so we can try some other entrees and those little sweet morsels.",

    "text": "I tried Dragon Palace after reading rave reviews here on Yelp. I rate three stars as I found the food okay but not great. The cuisine is Cantonese and I prefer dishes from the Sichuan province. I like a steamed dumpling and all Dragon offers are fried dumplings. I've had fried dumplings before at other restaurants and there are usually light fry marks on the dumpling's wrapper. The dumplings at Dragon seemed to be fried in a deep fat fryer. They were ok -- a bit on the heavy and greasy side. The House Special Beef was probably the best of the three entrees we ordered. The beef was VERY tender. The red pepper sauce that was served on the side was quite tasty. The Mongolian Beef was a bit flat and the Sesame Chicken seemed to be pieces of pre-fried chicken you'd get from Costco in the frozen section. Again, these seemed deep fried and not with a light, sticky coating that I prefer. The sauce was super sweet and lacked flavor. Also, Sesame Chicken is usually served with broccoli and this came with no vegetable.   I enjoyed the Chinese decor including lanterns with a spinning cylinder my grandmother used to have. Very Chinatown-ish as were the murals. However the bar area was very cluttered and seemed to be used partly for takeout box storage. The restaurant needs to de-clutter. It looked like health department certificates (home printed) were taped on a wall behind the cash register. Not good. Those should be trashed as well as the coin vending machines in the lobby.   This all said, the service was good, friendly and fast.   I like there is a pot of hot tea on the table. The fried banana strips at the end are also a nice touch.   Overall, Dragon Palace could use a lot of sprucing up and decluttering inside and dishes that offer a little more flavor. Not sure if I will return.",

    "text": "We ordered take out from Dragon Palace last night. My hubby went to pick it up on his way home from work and it was ready on time. Since this was our first time, we opted for the Mandarin Dinner for 2 so we could try a few things. I have to say that I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food because it tends to be too greasy and salty for me; however, this was Seriously SO delicious! We were pleasantly surprised to see the take out containers packed full. The Mandarin Dinner comes with 2 Egg Rolls and 2 Pork wontons (greasy but that's kind of just how they are - the taste was good tho), Wor Wonton Soup (so delicious) with fried crispies on the side, Mongolian Beef, Sweet and Sour Pork, Pork Fried Rice, 2 Fortune Cookies and 2 Almond Cookies---all for $30! What a great deal! Let's just say we have leftovers for lunch (plus some) today.    I'd never had Wor Wonton Soup before and this was packed full of chicken, shrimp, pork, veggies all in a clear broth and it was so flavorful! I normally add soy sauce (actually I use liquid aminos) but that would have made it too salty. It was perfect just the way it was prepared! This was my favorite dish and definitely ordering that again.  My husband loved the Mongolian Beef - just all beef and green onions in a yummy brown sauce. Lots of beef!!  The Sweet and Sour pork was perfect! Sometimes I order S&S and there's overkill of too many onions, peppers, and pineapple, but not this one! They really focus on delivering you the pork! The only change is next time I'll probably request the sweet and sour sauce on the side because by the time we got it home the pieces in the middle and bottom started getting a little soggy.  The Pork Fried Rice is packed with pork, veggies and eggs. We were very impressed. So yummy!  We will definitely be coming back! :)",

At first I didn't think I would like the soup when it came out because I tend to like broth that is darker and richer looking, and this broth seemed a little light for my tastes (I want a hybrid broth + sauce) but it was delicious! Flavorful and chock full of good things, I was definitely a fan. I also got some fried dumplings that were pretty good, although there's a place in Huntington Beach that makes them just the way I like them and I have yet to find a good replacement, and my brother got a beef dish that he really enjoyed. All in all it was a good experience, very authentic, and the people were nice albeit not overly friendly.",

We ordered the Peking Dinner for Two, which included Wor Wonton Soup, Pu Pu Platter, entrees of Mongolian Beef and House Special Chicken, with Peking Fried Rice. I also ordered an appetizer of BBQ Sliced Pork.  Even though the restaurant was crowded, service was really fast - our food was delivered quickly, and everything was delicious - and HUGE! We took home several portions. We were surprised when the check came with fortune cookies and 2 delicious honey-coated wonton skins with a banana slice inside, on the House.  Yummy!

We have lived in the neighborhood for several years but never noticed the restaurant as we drove by on 32nd Street. It is a gen worth seeking out for delicious Chinese takeout.   When I called in my order on a Saturday night we were thrilled to hear it would be ready for pickup within 10 minutes--wonderful! The good was ready promptly and was very affordable. We ordered 5 items and were charged less than $50, and had PLENTY of food for our group of 5, with adequate leftovers for the next day. Yum! The Peking Fried Rice was a favorite (so full of delicious meat), as well as the Mongolian Beef (so flavorful).  The decor inside the restaurant is festive and inviting. Best of all, the owners are friendly, professional, and greeted us warmly when we came to pick up the food. Thank you, Dragon Palace! We will be back!",

Had the Dragon Dinner Special. For 2. Mongollian beef, tender beef with scallions, a bit on the bland side but I like spicy, so I fixed it by adding chili oil and all was great. Really good Fried rice. Egg roll and honey chicken wing, all started with work won ton soup.  We also had house special chicken.  Very good.  Will go back.",

So, for nostalgic purposes, i took the fam there for dinner last night.  IT WAS AMAZING.  They definitely redeemed themselves from the last visit.  Dragon Palace is back in my rotation.  the only thing that i wasnt satisfied with is that they changed the recipe of their BoBo Shrimp.  the old recipe was waaay better.  Nonetheless, this a great chinese restaurant and glad to have it in our neighborhood.",

You go inside and the decor is loud, yet drab. The walls are painted a striking teal, accompanied with a bright red. Yet it's not very well lit, and the lights look like they  need replacing.   Anyways, we went there for dinner and the service was fast, and the servers were friendly. Our food came out quickly and hot. I really liked the crab puffs. Very good. It was also nice to get free hot tea and water - something I miss about a lot of Phoenix Asian based eateries. The food wasn't too greasy and tasted great. The chicken chow mein tasted a lot like Panda Express, but wasn't nearly as greasy. On average, for this time of day, the avg price for a meal was $10. Appetizers ran the gamut from $2 to $7 (on avg).   I will definitely be adding this to my list of regular haunts.",

Not only have you lost a customer and customers, now you have lost a devoted customer over what, because you didn't want to make a customers order right and basically accuse them of lying?

Egg rolls are tasty as is the egg drop soup.  The meals always come with the traditional hot tea and end with a fortune cookie.

Loved the hanging lanterns and the dark red seats and all the gold wood wall hanging which displayed various Chinese dragons.  It felt like a restaurant in china-town (but clean).  Bath rooms probably need a good in the cracks cleaning--- but overall it was clean.  (The kindof clean you want a restaurant bathroom to be in... get my drift?)  Best crab puffs in the area! Yum, you get 8 cream cheese filled pffs for 4.95.  The egg drop soup ($4.00 for a large) was flavorful and really thick--- a little too thick for my preference and full of celery.  My husband raved about it, thought it was the best ever.  We also ordered the Sizzling Rice Soup ($7.25 for a large), would've been knocked out of the park with flavor, ingrediants, however, the cook added too much salt.  Kids ordered a large egg fried rice sans the peas/carrots.  It had a great buttery/bacony flavor to it.  Wow--- so good.  Our entree was the Honey Walnut Shrimp for $11.95.  Shrimp tasted fresh, no funky flavored shrimp.  The sauce was light and when I say \"light\"  it was tossed perfectly.  Shrimp to sauce ratio was spot on.  The shrimp was lightly battered, no tempura shrimp here.  The walnuts came a little light, could've used a little more but it was about 15 large shrimps on the platter.  They priced it right for what you got.  It's your standard American chinese food.   Will definitely be back.  It was good..... if my soup wasn't so salty I probably would've given it 4 stars.  I\"m thinking this was even 3.5 star establishment.",

I don't think our waitress spoke any English beyond what was on the menu. She had to go get help from another waitress when I ordered a whiskey on the rocks. Even the more fluent of the two didn't think to ask me what kind of whiskey, so I was served rail that tasted like the ice cubes had come from a moldy dispenser.  The food was ok. Nothing special. I had the kung pao chicken. It lacked spice and came loaded with onions (which I had asked them to leave out).",

They stated 25 minutes for the order when I called it in.  I showed up 30 minutes later and the lobby was packed full of people.  There was no rhyme or reason to any of it.  Food was coming out and just sitting on the table.  They were not calling out names.  Just arbitrarily taking whoever fought their way to the counter first and hoping their food was ready.  They kept taking phone calls and every person was told 20-25 minutes, even though clearly, it was taking longer than than.  In all, it was an hour and 15 minutes from the time I called until I left with my food.  To top it off, the food was fairly bland and unremarkable.",

Their Peking dishes, soups and egg rolls are delicious. Their hot mustard is always spot on and brings out the head sweat. And how do they get so much food in those little boxes?",

When I came to pick up our order, the hostess at the front was very nice and there were many people in the restaurant.  I brought the order home, and it was all correct. I like the fact they put each container in a little plastic bag to cut down on leaks and spills. Plus they give you almond cookies and fortune cookies with your order.  But the food. Ugh! Unfortunately, it examples the worst of Americanized Chinese food. None of our four dishes - Mongolian beef, cashew chicken, kung pao chicken and house fried rice - really had any flavor, except the beef, which tasted of flour.  So disappointing! Won't be going back. One star for being pleasant and one for the packaging and almond cookies. That's it.",

It was ready to go, We ordered BBQ Pork Appetizer- very dry and over cooked Veg Chow Mein - A lot of vegetables laying on top not mixed in and the pasta was mushy Mixed Veggies -(snow peas, bamboo shoots, Black mushrooms) not what I expected, could be my fault, the mushrooms were like rubber. Are all black mushrooms like that? Lemon Chicken- sauce was good but the chicken was a fried breast sliced up and it was very dry Mongolian Beef - ok a little bland Pork fried rice - good Egg Rolls- good Fried Dumplings - my six year old liked them.  Ya Shan Beef- the best thing we ordered only half of which will be good for leftovers.  I don't think I will be going back.",

    "text": "Chinese has always been a bit of a tricky cuisine for me to review. Admittedly, this is partially due to my own ignorance, thanks to my parents excluding Chinese from the five or six restaurants we kept in continuous rotation during family dinner outings. It also has a lot to do with the fact that Chinese food, at least the American-influenced style we're most familiar with, hasn't really evolved much. Yes, there are corporate chains that suburban families flock to, as well as these so-called \"modern\" spots that simply replace the dragon decor with IKEA furnishings and big screen TVs. But is the food really all that different? When you think about it, pizza, burgers, and even Mexican food all have their fair share of changes over the years. But I rarely see or hear about any \"high-end\" Chinese restaurants, nor have I found much variation in the types of food available. It's all pretty traditional stuff, which is probably why its once exotic appeal has slowly waned in the last fifty years. The fact that roughly one-third of them are always named \"The Great Wall\" doesn't help matters much.   Wait, where was I? Oh, yes. Dragon Palace. A little family-owned Chinese restaurant that, from what I understand, has been around for quite some time. Located in a seedy looking plaza, it was one of the few Chinese places that popped up with some decent Yelp reviews, so I thought we'd give them a try.  Hey, complimentary tea upon being seated? Nice touch!  My girlfriend and I ordered a sampler platter, which consisted of two wontons, honey dipped chicken legs, egg rolls, and jumbo fried shrimp. Unfortunately, the wontons tasted stale, as if they had been sitting around for far too long. The egg rolls weren't too far off. In my opinion, these are the basic of the most basic items - and if something is wrong with them, that's probably not a good sign. Hell, if the Vietnamese and Thai crew, people that shamefully stole these items from the Chinese menu can do them right, why can't this place?  Our entrees were delivered shortly thereafter, quickly slapped down on the edge of the table by the server - similar to a barista plunking down a couple of iced coffees on the counter before running back to make another drink during the middle of a mad rush.  Typically, when I eat Chinese, I usually play it safe by ordering beef and broccoli and rarely deviate out of sheer fear. However, for once, I attempted to change things up by ordering their Kung Pao Chicken. I took about three bites and immediately surrendered. I still can't put my finger on what it was, but something, whether it be the peanuts, or some kind of strange oyster-like sauce, just gave the meat this very bizarre aftertaste that I strongly disliked.  My girlfriend ordered the chicken chow mein. Half was offered to me out of pity, due to my immediate dismissal of my Pao. It wasn't too bad, but nothing that I would order for myself. Once again, I can't really put my finger on why, it just seemed rather bland.  You also receive the traditional bowl of rice. Eh - rice is rice. I can make it in my microwave in six minutes, but it's there if you want it.  They serve a couple of complimentary banana fritters at the end of the meal, which I'll admit, was a charming move - especially since most Chinese restaurants don't seem too big on offering desserts. They were okay, but probably would have tasted better hot, as fried bananas typically do. Then again, they were free, so I guess I shouldn't complain.  Overall, I was not really impressed, which really now has me wondering who serves the best Chinese food in Phoenix. Allegedly, according to my girlfriend, the best Chinese restaurants are actually found in Mexico of all places - a belief that a colleague of mine also strongly supports. From what I've been reading, there's actually a quiet movement in Central Phoenix to give Chinese cuisine a bit of a boost - although I haven't quite experienced this just yet.  Ultimately, this just wasn't my type of place. Although reading some of the reviews, they seem to have their fair share of longtime fans, so take my opinion with a grain of salt - or in this case, a grain of MSG.",

The restaurant is full of traditional decorations and of course those large red booths. (They have tables too). Soft Chinese music playing in the background and some artwork.   Let's move on to the food...Dragon Palace has Mandarin and Szechuan dishes. The food is so good that I came in two weeks in a row.   We started with fried meat dumplings and crab puffs. Oh both are delicious and served with sweet and sour and hot chili sauces. We also had sizzling rice soup. One of the best Chinese soups I have ever had with chicken, shrimp and veggies. They also bring out complimentary fried wonton strips with dipping sauce to every table.   For dinner we had house special chicken which is lightly fried chicken breast sauteed in \"special sauce\". I don't know what this special sauce is, but I would drink it if I could. Yummy!  We also tried the sauteed happy family which is chicken, beef, shrimp, scallops and Chinese veggies all together covered in a brown sauce. Delicious! The brown sauce has a great flavor and is slightly sweet. They also don't skimp on any of the meat or seafood. I was impressed!   We did not try dessert, but they bring out complimentary banana wontons covered in honey with the check. Oh these are good!! Can I have more than one please!?  Another thing to mention is the full bar. When I go out for Chinese food I never think of ordering a cocktail. Dragon Palace had a pretty impressive cocktail menu. I didn't have a cocktail, but several people in the restaurant did and the drinks looks really good. I'll be sure to try one next time!  Enjoy!",

I found it tasted better when served at the restaurant. As take-out, it was a little dry. I've also found that most of the menu items that are labeled \"highly recommended\" are usually really good. Oh and for starters, the War Won Ton Soup is amazing! My only complaint is that the don't de-vein the shrimp!

    "text": "First off....I'm a rabbit! This according to every Chinese Zodiac.  I like being a rabbit. My opposite.....the cock! My wife apparently is a cock. So for eighteen years I have loved .....well, my Wife!   Dragon Palace has been around for a VERY long time. I remeber going there as a child and loving it. One of my daughters has been in gymnastics just west of this restaurant and I keep wanting to eat here again and I continually drive by without stopping. My family generally eats at Nee-House or Jade Palace but the nostalgia here had my curiousity piqued.   This past weekend I made an executive choice. \"Family\" I said, \"We are going to Dragon Palace tonight for dinner\" I was so excited. This was going to be a huge throwback to my childhood. So we arrive and so goes!  We walk up to two Chinese Red colored doors. I remember these doors being gigantic, not so big anymore when you are 6' tall. I open the door for my family to enter and the wonderfull smell wafed by my nose. Just the smell I remember, a True chinese smell. When we entered there was an old Chinese man at the front counter. I wonder if he was here 25 years ago? The lanterns adorned the rooftop just like I remember back in the eighties. Pink and blue hues were splashed on the walls. No frills, just the iconic, eclectic and stereotypical Chinese joint. So far everything is great. Now the food has to be good. And it was. I must say I was peased big time. I am a very adventurous eater usually. NOT TONIGHT. I wanted simple traditional Americanized chines fair and they hit on all levels. Wor Wonton Soup, Egg Foo Yung, Mongollion Beef, Orange Chicken, Low Mein (house), Crab Puff and Egg Rolls. Easy comfort stuff. It was very good, very fresh.   Dragon Palace always served a \"treat\" at the end of the meal. Ice Cream usually. Now it appears they serve a new and even better treat after the meal. Get this, Banana, wrapped in wonton skin, deep fried and drizzled with honey. Crispy, Chewy, Golden and sweet. Those little chats are off the map. Loved it and we will be back soon!!!",

Dragon Palace provides quick, thorough, and friendly service. Very well packaged to-go orders that keep you from having sauce spill out all over your car. I've tried a few dishes and found that they can sometimes be a bit bland, but overall it's quality Chinese food. I happen to be addicted to the Mu Shu Pork. I was surprised they wrap the crepes before packaging, but it really seems to allow the flavors to blend together and they're just plain good.  I had been really disappointed with not being able to find a decent Chinese takeout place in Phoenix and Dragon Palace is just what the doctor ordered!",

The Asian man started screaming, \"no subtooshin, no subtooshin, it say no subtooshin\". I'm thinking damn, it was only a request. I said \"ok\", then he starts in with \"hot sour soup very special, feed 6 people, has lots of stuff in it\". I said ok, and he again said \"I no subtoot, you get soup\". Ok. Kinda funny when I look back at it. Maybe that is why it was me and one more table for lunch.",

The egg rolls were stuffed with yummy goodness, the honey chicken was finger-licking good, there was TONS of pork fried rice packed into that container. My goodness was it stuffed. The only disappointment was the twice cooked pork. Don't get me wrong it was good, but when I ask for extra, extra spicy, that is exactly what I am expecting and it fell short. :(  But will it stop me from going back,? heck no.

    "text": "So I'm not a big Chinese food fan, but my husband is. Truth be told, it usually makes me sick. But if I were to go to Chinese food, Dragon Palace would be one of the places that I would go. The food is decent and there's a lot of it. I really felt I was getting my value's worth.  The waitstaff was attentive (always there asking if I wanted a refill) and the food came out quickly. It looks like every other Chinese food restaurant in the world (lots of red and gold, lanterns, paper Chinese Horoscope place mat -- save for the deep teal walls).  I'm not sure I would make a long drive to Dragon Palace because chances are you have a comparable Chinese food restaurant nearby, but if you live in the 32nd St. and T-Bird vicinity, this is certainly a Chinese food place worth trying.   As for the food, we ordered the Peking dinner for 2 which came with won ton soup, a pu pu platter (consisting of won tons - yum -, eggroll, a small fried shrimp, a skewer of glazed beef and honey chicken), Peking fried rice (fried rice with shrimp, chicken, pork and beef), Mongolian beef and the house chicken. (as an aside and a disclaimer, I am preggers right now and I have developed a severe dislike for chicken which means I, of course, hated the chicken dishes). My husband thought it all was ok. I really liked the won ton soup and the Peking fried rice. After dinner, we got the requisite fortune cookie (\"Express yourself now.\" WHAT?) and a really yummy banana wrapped in a won ton and fried with a sugar glaze thing.  All in all, it was a good time at a pretty good Chinese Food Restaurant.",

We were seated right away (can't say that for the masses that showed up within the hour after us) and ur server took our drink orders right away, although you'd think it was the first time she'd ever waited a table before. Thankfully, my brother is a waiter so he helped her keep track of what we wanted. Unfortunately, receiving our meal took FOREVER. On a positive note, it was a TON of food and generally pretty tasty. We tried various fried rice plates, chicken chow mein, beef and broccoli and assorted vegetables. Again, pretty good but that might be helped by the fact that we were starving by the time it showed up. They did their best on an extremely busy night, but they need some professional organization assistance or guidance.",

But, boy oh boy has the food changed.  The food was incredible.   We started with egg drop soup, hearty and delicious at a mere $2.00  It had tofu in it too.  I had the shredded pork with brown rice (1.00 add on).  It was a huge portion but more importantly, delicious.  The other dish was a beef dish (name? ) Shi- something.

Both times the servers were abrupt and it feels like they just throw cups and plates in front of you. Last night they also brought soup and food at once which made us feel rushed.   Our first visit, we tried wor wonton soup, kung pao, and walnut shrimp--it was all pretty good, and flavorful though the kung pao seemed to be only peanuts and chicken. I'd give it 4 stars. Last night we came back for the soup and tried a few appetizers.  Everything was fine, but generally lacked flavor (except the honey chicken wings which were GREAT).  Throw in the service, and we're just not sure we'll come back...",

We got a chicken & noodle dish, beef & broccoli, egg rolls, crab puffs and fried wings. The only thing I thought really needed improvement was the fried wings. This was my first time ordering from this place so I'm not sure if I didn't order correctly or what. I usually get these and they have a sauce on them but these were just plain without any type of sauce (maybe you need to add a sauce?). It was still a good meal; fed 3 people dinner and then lunch the next day too so about $6-7/meal. I'd go again if in the area.",

Then, I found Dragon Palace. Don't let the sketchy shopping mall deter you!  Consistently fast, hot, fresh food. You also get huge portion sizes, so you're paying for your lunch or dinner for the next day or two as well.   I've always dined in because not only are they quick, but you get complimentary hot tea and little banana fried wonton things at the end of your meal. Hard to describe but they are so good.   I've never gotten take out before but they must do well with that too as I always see people coming and picking up food while I am there. Service is always prompt. Sure, you aren't getting any small talk from the servers and they are to the point, but I'm not looking for a drawn out meal when I eat at a place like this. Highly recommend!",

They offered a high chair and it was the most unsafe and annoying high chair I've ever seen. It came with a silver pan tray so anytime she pounded on the tray, it would make this loud sound that bounced off the walls. It was quite annoying and people in the restaurant seemed annoyed too. So we told the waitress we will just order take out, which made us feel more awkward while we waited for our food and service practically ended while the employees just watched us - my hubby sitting down in the booth and me trying to console my fussy daughter, walking in the front of the restaurant. Awkward.   We ordered the shrimp fried rice, the shrimp with lobster sauce and house special beef. The food was delicious! The fried rice had whole, tender, succulent shrimps. I was pretty satisfied. I just know I'll be just ordering take out and not dining in next time.",

All I could think was \"what does the kitchen look like?\" I had the wonton soup, shrimp fried rice, house special chicken, and sauteed happy family. All of the food was tasty and tasted authentic. A little salty, but I've reduced the amount of salt I cook with so that may just be my tastebuds. I found all of the staff to be friendly enough. I'm not sure why there are so many reviews that say they're unfriendly. It may just be the reviewers lack of understanding of the culture. As long as my food is delivered to my table in a timely manner, and hot and tasty when I get it, that's good enough for me. I don't need or want the small talk that you get in American restaurants. I'll definitely be back to try some of their other dishes.",

However, the chicken chow mein, lemon chicken, and eggrolls were not as expected. The coating on the lemon chicken was crunchy but the chicken was very dry and chewy not moist at all, as was the chicken in the chow mein.  The eggrolls were just okay, not memorable, and the steamed rice was somewhat on the cold side and lacked any flavor. The meal just wasnt very good.  Maybe, I went on an off day.

    "text": "Wow - a lot of 5 star reviews on the Dragon Palace.  I suspect many are giving heavy handed reviews as this is a \"sentimental\" favorite.  I guess even my rating is slightly biased that way too.  But 5 stars people?  Meaning it cannot get any better than \"woohoo, as good as it gets\"?  Ok, I'll end my rant and get to the review.  In short, this is your typical old school Mandarin/Szechuan style chinese restaurant.  Decor is slightly tired, but who really cares about decor anyways for a neighborhood chinese restaurant?  Staff couldn't have been friendlier.  It's family run (from what I gather) and take out service is quick and efficient.  They include almond cookies, sauces, utensils, and fortune cookies in a nice packet with your to go order.  Everything was packaged VERY well.  The menu is a diverse variety of your typical chinese items.  Be aware that some dishes (like the Moo Goo Gai Pan) have alternate names (like \"Snow White Chicken\").  Still with me?  Good...on to the food.  I ordered BBQ pork slices, Kung Pao Chicken, and a dish they called \"Bo Bo Shrimp\".    The BBQ pork slices were generally not too fatty as they can be other places, however some pieces were sliced too thin as they were dry.  Also, the seasoning did not permeate the meat that much.  There was also no \"sauce\" (which is good, because Char Siu should not have any sauce per se).  Maybe I'm just spoiled with good BBQ pork, and I also realize it's just an appetizer, but could have been better and more flavorful.  The Kung Pao Chicken is very average.  First I'm appreciative of chinese restaurants that use dark meat instead of white as it's not dry.  But add to that a lot of peanuts that were a little overpowering (I felt like an elephant), lots of cubed green pepper and onion, and a lot of sauce made this the typical Kung Pao chicken.  Was it bad?  It wasn't bad, but not 5 stars great either.  I don't know if I really understand why Phoenix area chinese places are compelled to throw a ton of vegetables in Kung Pao.  It'd be nice for once to have a relatively vegetable-less \"meat\" dish and order vegetables separately (like how you order at better chinese places).  Compared to other places in Phoenix, it was probably better than what I've had, but again, not 5 stars \"amazing\".  The Bo Bo shrimp was a breaded shrimp dish with a spicy brown sauce.  On the positive, I tasted the ginger and garlic come out of the sauce, but the breading on the shrimp was so heavy it was falling off as I ate it.  Perhaps it was because it was take out and it got soggy, so I'll reserve some judgement for when I dine in person, but I've had plenty of take out and the shrimp are not always like that.  I would have preferred a lighter coating which can be achieved with a dusting of cornstarch.  I can see why this place has gotten the accolades because relatively speaking, there isn't a lot of good accessible chinese food here in Phoenix (well, unless you go to Cofco Plaza, Lee Lee Market, Great Wall, etc.).  But again, there is much better around.  With that being said, if you've read my other reviews you'll see I am a big fan of locally run non-chain restaurants.  So don't let my review scare you too much, I'm just picky and have high expectations.  I certainly could have ordered items that are difficult to make poorly (Mushu pork, mongolian beef, etc.) but chose Kung Pao as it's difficult to pull off properly.  So please try this place for yourself and form your own opinion.  At least you have mine.",

    "text": "I can't figure out HOW we made such a mistake with this place, with such good reviews. First, it was expensive ($30 for takeout- a sesame chicken, a schezuan chicken, and fried rice... I was expecting a tab closer to $21-25 with tax.)   When we got our takeout home, we were hopeful. All of my fellow Yelper's reviews were so glowing. Now I'm convinced that every person who rated it with 5 stars was paid to do so or came just for the tea and fortune cookies- but I'm not sure as we didn't eat in.   Our food was inedible. I'm serious- and usually once I've shelled out a few bucks for something I'll at least hunker down and eat it, but instead I'd rather go hungry tonight. And my husband will eat ANYTHING, so for him not to touch his dish is pretty reassuring to me that I'm not just some crazy snob who doesn't like the food (and Chinese is never a bad choice for me, I've never given up.) The sesame chicken tasted like soggy chicken nuggets. Bland and mushy. The schezuan chicken clearly was made up of canned chicken. Tiny nondescript bits of white meat that seemed extremely processed (not fresh at all), and in some sort of spicy-ketchup sauce. The fried rice was the only thing I would consider worth eating, but was full of the same canned-chicken processed crap. I'm serious, you could almost confuse the meat here for \"Chicken of the Sea.\" Same preserved flavor, and that's not the MSG talking.  Maybe we ordered the wrong things, I don't know, but we literally took about 3 bites each and stared in remorse at our inedible dinner, as we contemplated calling for a refund or going out for a frozen pizza.   Never again will I eat here. They were SO nice- SO nice. That's about the only remarkable thing about this place. Unlike other Yelpers, I would try ANY other place in the valley before returning for more of the same here.",

    "text": "Dragon Palace has become my new go-to Chinese place. After having brought home dinner from here several times, Hubby and I decided to eat in last night. It was a totally solid meal once again.   The egg drop soup is like no other I have ever had- thick, savory, and eggy, with small squares of tofu and red bell pepper. I am normally repulsed by anything with bell pepper, but this stuff is so delicious, I can totally overlook it. This time, I decided to try the won ton soup, and it, too, was awesome- savory and full of perfectly cooked won tons with little nuggets of pork inside, topped with green onions. Delicious.   We also got the crab puffs- again, these are some of the best I've had in Phoenix. They also have regular and vegetarian egg rolls. I don't think the latter are on the menu, but just ask for them. They are pretty good.   I have had the house special chicken, the sweet and sour pork (minus the bell pepper, of course), and the three seas (scallops, shrimp, and chicken with snow peas and bamboo in a light sauce). All are very good, very generously portioned, and almost entirely meat. The scallops in particular were so well cooked, and next time I go I will have a scallop dish. Hubby has had three types of vegetarian entrees- the family bean curd, the veggie and egg crepes, and the mushrooms, peas, and bamboo combo- and he has enjoyed them all.   They do not deliver, but do a brisk takeout business. While we were dining, they had someone picking something up every few minutes. They are super fast with the takeout, even with special requests. You will wait only 10 minutes and have everything well packaged and ready for transport. Everything is still hot when I get home, even after more than half an hour drive.   Dragon Palace does not have everything on the menu that I would want in my ideal Chinese restaurant, but it comes close. Everything we have eaten has been good at the very least, and often among the best we've had in the Phoenix metro, and the prices are very reasonable.",

    "text": "After seeing Amy P's review of this place I had to give my own. If you have read my other reviews it is plain to see I think I know what I am talking about when it comes to food. So, being a True NYer and a good Jew I love Chinese food. It's Kosher, right? Anyway, I have had my fair share of it and Dragon Palace stands up to almost all of it, save Chinese food in Seattle.   It is located in the corner of a strip mall, which Megan M pointed out is a little shady. Couldn't be more spot on. There is a bar in the opposite corner and run-down looking car wash close by. Putting that aside it is your stereotypical Chinese restaurant. It smells great when you walk in and there are a couple of cheap candy and toy machines right when you walk in. You are always greeted by the owner, who speaks passable and sometimes unintelligible English. Most of the time I am picking up food to go, but when I have eaten here the service has been very quick and attentive. It is good for big groups too.  No matter what you like in the way of Chinese food you will find it here. Everything I have eaten has been very good. The soups, appetizers, and main dishes are all consistent each time I order them, which is what I look for in a good eatery.   My favorites include the egg rolls, wonton soup, mo shu pork, house special chicken, mongolian beef, and lemon chicken.  The only thing that bugs me about this place, is what gets my Dad riled up every time we order from them. So after getting food from here for about 10 years my Dad started to notice that the bill was always ending in .0, .05, or .10 increments. So, this one time my Dad decided to figure out the bill himself, tax and all. When we went to pick up the food he argued with the owner for about 10 minutes about the fact that they were rounding up on the tax. It may have only been a few cents, but it pissed my Dad off. The owner said that they \"don't deal in penny.\" My Dad retorted with, \"Well the IRS does.\" The owner told him he was a big problem and would remember his name. He proceeded to storm off and cuss my Dad out in Chinese. To this day my Dad doesn't use his name to place pick up orders. It is still a running joke in my family. After all this we still order from them.",

    "text": "I totally love this place. It reminds me of the old school hardcore Chinese restaurant my parents used to take us when we were kids :D   The decor is amazing- unlike more Chinese places in Phoenix. The walls are a teal blue, adorned with large carved pieces of artwork depicting scenes in China, golden dragons and more. The lights hanging from the ceiling are amazingly ornate. The place looks like its from a bygone era (doesn't help that its in a run down strip mall) but it is clean and charming inside.  The service was great- kind to our 2 yo, and very attentive. The food was the best part- I can't remember the last time I had such good Chinese food, and it's priced very reasonably. We got the Peking dinner for 2 which included the fried noodles, hot tea, wonton soup (with generous noodles, meat, shrimp and veggies, the best I've ever had), a pupu platter with eggrolls, bbq skewers, house wings and those cheese puff thingies (the presentation is pretty cool, too). Next came 3 entree sized plates of food: mongolian beef, fried chicken (can't remember the name) and the Peking fried rice. The meal concluded with incredible little desserts- sort of like eggrolls but filled with banana and then covered with crystalized honey. I could have eaten 100 of them! Adding in a beverage and tax, the meal was only $34!   My 2 yo can really eat, so I am surprised and pleased to say that even with sharing the dinner for 2 people with him, the 3 of us walked out with lots of leftovers. Highly recommended. Do it! DO IT!",

    "text": "This place brings back great memories. Of youth, fun and friends. A few weeks ago, I decided I wanted to eat here again. I had not done so in years (more then 5, less then 10). I took a new friend and ordered my old favorite, House Special Chicken. It was just as I remembered it. Crispy fried outside, sitting in a ginger and garlic sauce (I love it when food in a sauce is still crisp). My friend approved of her Sesame Chicken but I didn't try any of it, myself.   One bite took me back 11 years. To a very young man of 19 and his friends. Just coming back from a California road trip and stopping at their then favorite eatery. Ordering our favorite dishes, annoying the proprietor with our laughter and naive inconsideration (we didn't know better back then). Coincidentally, I bumped into one of these old friends there, this trip.   I wondered whether the dish was good because of the memories or because it was just, legitimately, good. So a few weeks later I asked if my parents would let me treat them to Chinese. Bo Bo Chicken, Yu Shuan Chicken & House Special were ordered. The Bo Bo was tasty. I wish it were spicier (as purported) but understand that not everyone has a Chicano mouth like mine. It kind of reminded me of Ramen noodles, the instant kind. I love Ramen. The Yu Shuan was good too. Meat was dark so it was juicy and flavorful but was also supposed to be spicy and was not. House Special was great, again.   What did the critics say? \"It all really good, mijo.\" Success.   I wholeheartedly recommend this place if you want the takeout variety of Chinese food. I recommend Nee House more so overall but for tasty, stick-to-your-ribs, let's-get-Chinese-and-watch-a-movie Chinese food, Dragon Palace is hard to beat. The dark, quiet atmosphere and great service of the place is a big plus to me too, so I say, eat-in if you can.",

Located in a small ghetto looking strip mall in northern Phoenix, Dragon Palace comes off looking like ever other mom and pop place on town. However, let it be known this is the place to try. Even if it is a bit of a drive for you, it is worth it.   Their food quality of above most places that are comparable in styles. Their menu is huge, anything you could possible want they have, and if it isn't on the menu I am sure the adorable little old man that waits on you will do his best to make you want you want. At lunch time they have a great deal for around $6 you get your choice of entree item that comes with soup, won tons with sweet and sour sauce (my fave!!), an egg roll and either white or brown rice. Way more food than one should eat at once. Not to worry though, the reheating factore is wonderful in this situation!   Check them out. Also, while you wait for you wonderful yummyness to arrive, check out your Chinese horoscope, interesting stuff! :-)",

    "text": "Dragon Palace is your stereotypical, neighborhood Chinese restaurant. It's back in the corner of a shady looking strip mall, which doesn't exactly draw you in. The restaurant itself is decorated with rather gaudy, gold and red decorations, complete with red paper lanterns.  Although I don't come here for the atmosphere, I wish one of these days they'd put a sound system in and play some background music. Despite the less-than-elegant decor, this restaurant has a certain charm to it.  I've been coming here with my family for about 20 years and it's still my restaurant of choice for Chinese food. The egg rolls and crab puffs are pretty tasty, but my favorite appetizer is the egg drop soup. It's thick, flavorful and I have yet to find a rival anywhere. Great dishes include the Mongolian beef, cashew chicken and house special chicken. Americans everywhere have their favorite, must order Chinese food dish and I'm willing to bet you'll find a pleasant version of it at Dragon Palace.   The best time to go is at lunch! It's quick and cheap. Their lunches, which come with a generous helping of your choice of dish (say kung pao chicken), rice, egg roll, 2 wontons and either egg drop or wonton soup are less than $6, most around $5. If you're REALLY on a budget, order a bowl of egg drop soup for only $1.   The only thing you can't get at lunch time is their after-dinner, Banana Caramel Delights! They drop one off for each person with the check.This isn't the actual name for them, but as they are complimentary and not on the menu, I'm not sure what they are called. They are basically banana filled crispy wonton wrappers that are then coated in a crunchy, sugary, caramel coating. If you like bananas and sweet things, you'll love these!   If you're craving Chinese food, stop and eat here or pick up a to-go order and eat it in whatever environment you choose!",

The food was very very good and more than substantial on portions. Had extra to box up and take back to hotel. Saw a bunch of locals dining here so that's always a great sign.

    "text": "Woohoo! I finally made it back to one of my favorite Chinese Restaurants in the valley... Dragon Palace! It's been many years since my last visit, primarily because I'm on the west side of Phoenix. And Wong's is closer.  No disrespect to Dragon Palace! What Wong's offers in its classy digs, Dragon Palace counters with in-your-face classic character straight out of China Town. And considering how long it's been since the last time I dined here, they maintain the establishment very well! The decor, the tables and the floors are very clean.  Aside from the eye candy, the cuisine is why I respect Dragon Palace so much. It's authentic, it's delicious, and it's very reasonably priced. Especially when you comprehend how much food is included in the Peking Dinner which I split with a friend. Not everything was photographed for this review because the amount of food on our table was just getting silly.  From the Pu Pu Platter (basically every appetizer on the menu) to the Won Tons and the Wonton Soup, we would have had what most would consider a filling meal. But then the entrees showed up. Three of them. All family sized by my standards. There were days of delicious left overs to be had.  Not only are the flavors impressive, but the presentation of the Pu Pu Platter was old school awesome! The flame burning at the center of the dish was something I hadn't seen before. And of course, the service was impeccable. Besides being seated quickly, the meal arrived in a rapid (but not too quick) fashion. Drinks were tended to and our server boxed the remains of our entrees faster than you would expect. Must be a common occurrence.  I'm happy Dragon Palace hasn't changed from what I remember so fondly. And don't judge this place by the crappy little strip mall it's located in. That's on the landlord. Whoever owns this property is lucky to have this restaurant as a tenant. (How about maybe repairing the parking lot?)  I will be back much sooner next time!",

    "text": "This is my last visit to Dragon Palace. Let me explain. I decided to do take out and have it delivered by DoorDash. I ordered the chicken with mushrooms ( which I think is really good), Moo goo gai pan (with extra white meat which costs and extra dollar) easy on the veggies, egg rolls and two small won ton soups. Easy enough. DoorDash delivered my complete order within 35 minutes. Hot and almost ready to eat or so I thought. Both soups had leaked. The lids were cracked which was probably the drivers fault but the moo goo gai pan was not prepared as ordered. We called back and spoke to someone at the restaurant and they agreed to replace the soups and I would have to pick them up which I wasn't happy about but ok however the other order they said we would have to pay for again. Needless to say I was furious. I would have come to pick up the food but not pay 10 again for something in my opinion lacks flavor. I won't be returning here.  Food C+, Customer service. Fail.",

Everything pretty much looked the same but the food has changed. It's still decent but not as good as it once was. I ordered orange beef and got chicken instead and service was slow. The egg drop soup is really thick for some reason almost like a stew which kind of turned me off. We ordered the bobo chicken (an old fav) and the sauce was very thick and different with a lot of garlic so it wasn't what we were expecting. The orange chicken we got was good but fried rice lacked flavor I thought. I'd still go if in the area but it's not as good as I remember.",

Last night my husband suggested we go because I wasn't feeling well and he knows that their sizzling rice soup is my favorite!!!   It was so awesome to walk thru the doors and feel like I was back to my childhood, nothing has changed and the best part the food hadn't either still it's great flavor!!   Best Chinese food around!!!   Tonight we enjoyed the sizzling rice soup, egg rolls, cashew shrimp and pork fried rice..  You have to try this place, you won't be disappointed in the food or the service and you will come back for more guaranteed..",

Service is another subject and when they brought out the food, each dish came out appx 7 mins apart. By the time everything came out the first 2 dishes were warm. Anyways, I gave it 3 for the food and nothing else. Oh and they were surprised that we needed a menu for my grandson who is 10, and at the end they brought us 2 fried wonton wrappers dipped in simple syrup and ignored my grandson. So strange.",

Got our food for a second time to realize the meal isn't fully described on menu so can't eat it anyways. Asked to speak for a manager, and am told there isn't one on duty. Then someone appears that seems to be a manger to see what the problem is? Don't usually leave reviews but I would try Ba Dar down the street and save you some time, money, and gas.  We got our refund 3 hours later after speaking to the owner. Come to find out our food was incorrect based on their online menu and the young man with red hair at the front desk didn't want to deal with it/ or didn't know his menu. He rolled his eyes, made RUDE comments, and was just plain awful the entire time. If he's at the desk when you walk in, just be prepared for either a fake smile, or a nasty attitude.   At least I got my money back to eat somewhere else.",

An excellent value for some above-mediocre \"American-style\" Chinese food. We go there as a family a lot. Why? Because the family dinners rock. Free bottomless hot tea, soup, appetizers, one entree-per-person served family style for sharing, generous amounts of rice, fast and friendly service, and an I-don't-know-how-they-stay-in-business price. $15-$17/per for the family meal that includes all that I mentioned above, it really is the budget-conscious winner.",

The house chicken was a mix of white and dark meat and a lot of breading, and the mu shu pork came out already rolled.   The soup arrived and then everything came out very quickly afterwards and was awkwardly placed on our table in one corner in the way of everything else. We were constantly rearranging things so we could access our plates.   With our check we got a pleasant surprise of sweet and sticky banana wontons.

When we were seated, we were asked what we wanted to drink, and we asked for water. This is for medical reason not cost reasons. My husband has diabetes and due to an autoimmune disease I cannot have the chemicals on soda. We have gotten iced tea there before, but it had an odd taste. From then on our server has an attitude. When we asked for boxed for the rest of our food, my husband did not notice they were 2 different sizes. Server then got mad cuz he was using wrong size to box up his entree. She literally took box and plate out of his hands. Lastly I was eating the desert fritters they bring at end of meal and she took the plate away while I was eating it.  Needless to say, I will he ordering take out from here going forward cuz the food is delish!

Once inside, you can tell it's has been around for a while. However, I have been here 3 times with my family and every time the Kung-food and the service here has been no less than amazing.   The older gentleman that runs the place is always accommodating and friendly. My boyfriend is allergic to shrimp and they are more than willing to cater to his needs and make substitutions when necessary. The quality of food is always consistent each time and is by far the best that I have tasted in Phoenix.   They generally aren't super packed which is confusing given the quality of the food here, although they do have a lot of business on the take out side. We generally get the family style meals which include several delicous items. The one we usually get includes Wonton soup, the Poo Poo Platter (lol), Mongolian beef (which my boyfriend swears by), Sizzling Shrimp, House Special Chicken (best chicken ever), Mushu Pork, and Peking Fried Rice. And they top off every meal with these little banana filled glazed turnover squares.   Prices are decent all around which is also a plus given the quality of the food. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who would like a delicious, memorable and authentic Chinese meal.",

So I passed on that I went to go pick up. As they do not deliver I got there and was presented with a bag smaller than a grocery store bag so I asked where the rest of order was the women said it's all there. I got hm & there were 4 small food containers 1 box for egg rolls , 1 box of house special chicken , 1 box sweet & sour & 1 box of rice !!!! One box for both entrees we got one small box , I was pleasantly surprised to see almond cookies a nice touch it so I thought after taking a few bites of dinner my husband & I threw out the food & I tried to eat the almond cookie & thought I was  going to chip my tooth it was do old and hard a total waste of $27.00 won't be returning.",

A meal out at a Chinese restaurant was a weekly treat for me and my family when I was a kid but I've struggled to find a decent option close to home here in AZ. Dragon Palace is exactly what I'd been looking for.   Love the Mongolian Beef and the Wor Won Ton soup. The House Special Chicken was different than any I'd tasted before, but probably not my favorite version of the dish. The lunch specials are amazing and I'm so happy they offer them on Saturdays. Start off with egg drop soup and crunchy noodles; then the entree of your choice, fried rice, egg roll and won tons plus hot tea. My meal was $6.45 and I was stuffed.   My dislikes: they don't open until noon on Saturdays. I'm an early bird ready for lunch by 11:00 a.m. usually. But worth the wait anyway. They served my husband's meal a good 3 minutes before mine which we felt was weird. The fried rice was only so-so. I like veggies in my fried rice.   All in all, I'm happy I found this place and that is thanks to the reviews of my fellow Yelpers!",

In fact, we go once or twice a month and now know the owners, who are very friendly.  And they even know us by name, which comes in handy when we happen to place phone orders.   Before you even order, they start you off with hot tea, if you desire.  After we place our order, the soup is served piping hot, with those amazing crunchy pieces to put in the soup, or, as my young son does, to dip in the red sauce often used for egg rolls.  And speaking of egg rolls, Dragon Palace has the best egg rolls I have ever tasted anywhere.  Their entrees are exceptional and huge; we always have a \"doggy bag\" for leftovers when we leave.  The atmosphere is conducive to what you should get at a Chinese restaurant, with decorations, lighting, and music.  One time, when the music was not Asian sounding, my son asked the owners to change it to their usual music, and they did as he requested.  Dragon palace is the best Chinese restaurant anywhere.",

Then this is your place, all the way the decor to the food and the way they course it in their presentation is a blast from the past. P.S this was my grandmas favorite Chinese Restaurant.  We all ate here in memory of her on her funeral.   The owner is nice but you can tell this isn't his first Rodeo if you know what I mean.  He is very robotic now, but still nice. You will either love this place or if you like more modern places prob hate it.",

The chicken wasn't bad or chewy like some places you will find and the egg rolls and crab wontons were amazing. The only thing I would say that could be improved is the flavor of the Kung Pao. It was good but was not very spicy and was a little on the bland side. Other than that this will definitely be a place I will go to again.",

The decor is a bit tired with a little TOO teal walls.  In fact, when I eat there I find myself thinking of simple ways to update the interior to make the restaurant a bit more fresh and friendly.  Dark decor aside, the service is great, the food very tasty and the prices quite reasonable.  My husband and I often pick up take-out to eat at home and our favorites are the \"Sauteed Happy Family\", \"Crystal Shrimp\"  and the \"BBQ Sliced Pork\" appetizer.  The \"Moo Shu Pork\" is also delicious and the PuPu Platter for 2 at $7.50 is a smokin' deal!  This spot is well worth a visit if you're in the mood for Chinese food.",

Thanks to you Yelper's we braved the location.  (on a side note, this ghetto strip mall has an Irish Dance Studio, Fencing Studio, A Toy store that is gotta be seen to be believed and Joe's Grotto featuring a stage for bands.)  Walking through the big red doors entering the restaurant I was suddenly flashing back to childhood memories of my families favorite Chinese restaurant in CT circa 1965.  Same decor, reds, blues, big red banquets, and complete with gold dragon's!    The owner is really nice!  He has been in this same location since 1979.  I only know of a handful of restaurants that have stayed in business in the valley that long.  He gets 4 stars just for that!!  The menu has all the regular \"americanized\" Chinese dishes....sweet and sour pork, egg foo yung, chow mein, mu shu, etc....will be back again to find our favorites on the menu.  We had the fried dumplings, bo bo shrimp, peking fried rice and house special fried chicken.  Everything was fresh and tasty!   This is one of the better \"americanized\" Chinese restaurants in town!",

Maybe reserve a few spots out front for take-out customers? But, the food is so good here, I'd park down the street! Again, Chinese take-out is VERY hit or miss in AZ. This place reminds me of home (NY). I have tried a lot of asian restaurants in the Valley, and Dragon Palace posts up at the top spot! Fast, friendly, and reasonably priced. Try the Peking Fried Rice or Chow Mein, so good. The Orange Peel Beef, and Sesame Chicken are to die for. Beef/Shrimp with Snow Peas, and the House Special Chicken/Shrimp is great. The War Wonton is the best I've ever had. And honestly, I would never have tried this place if not for the other reviewers. The fact that this place has been around this long, and customers have been coming here for years and years and always satisfied; I had to try it out. So glad I did, thank you! This IS my place for Chinese now and later. Really happy to have found this little gem. :)",

The issues listed below were addressed with the manager/owner but he made excuses for the problems and did not attempt to correct. I would not recommend this restaurant in any way shape or form to anyone for fear they will be disappointed or sick.  The issues 1. Fried wontons - cold, hard and no filling.  2. Egg rolls - filled with old meat and tasted awful.  3. Egg drop soup was really thick from over cooking 4. The fried rice was full of old and new meat (complemented by the light and dark colors plus an old taste) 5.  The Mongolian beef was the most offensive in taste - super salty and watery (the manager said that's how they do it there). 6. The sweet and sour chicken tasted like donuts deep fried in old oil. The shell of the pastry was crisp but every piece was doughy.  Topping the chicken was a sweet glaze but did not complement the chicken.  7. Stale fortune cookie  The dinner was finished with some odd baklava looking sweet but we were so done with the restaurant that we didn't try it.",

I was about to turn away in disappointment when the owner unlocked the door and asked if i was just doing carry out.  When I said yes he welcomed me inside and took my order.  That right there is just fantastic business.   Try seeing that at any other place, you would leave hungry.... especially at a certain place on tatum/thunderbird that shall not be named.

    "text": "What a nice little \"gem of a restaurant\" to answer our craving for Asian  food!  Thanks Yelpers!!!  The food and service at this place are China-licious!  The prices are just $, a bargain!  The Dragon Palace is tucked away in the corner of an older strip center on the east side of N 32rd just north of E Thunderbird.  It looks like it's been here for years, and I mean a lot of years...  But don't let deter you from trying the Dragon Palace!  Restaurant~ the decor is old.  It's is a thrown back into the late seventies and early eighties with huge red vinyl booths with the high backs.  The walls are solid blue (I guess as a contrast maybe?) with some Asian inspired borders and prints.  They have those old Asian lamps hanging for the ceiling.  Although this place is a through back into time of another era, the place is very clean and comfy.    Service~ excellent from when you enter their restaurant until you leave.  5 star service.  Food~ all of their lunch meals come with water and hot tea, complimentary.  They also offer the usual beverage choices if you so desire something else.  The hot tea was very good!    Their menu is also a through back to old Asian restaurants I used to go to when I was a kid.  I remember when mom would say \"we are going to go and eat Chinese\" and I would say \"mom, we're not cannibals do you mean Asian or Chinese food?\"    After a slap on the back of the head we were off ~ ready to get stuffed since they always brought you way too much food.  All of their lunch meals here at the Dragon Palace come with a very tasty bowl of egg drop soup (thick and tasty!), wontons, egg roles, rice is fried or steamed  and the main entree.  We had their Beef with Broccoli and their Mongolian Beef.  Both dishes were China-licious!!  Our entire meal was less than $20 with the tip!  I'm looking forward to going \"Back in Time\" at he Dragon Palace again real soon.  Hopefully I will see you there.",

    "text": "Our family decided to try Dragon Palace this evening for dinner. Having grown up in downstate New York exposed to NY American Chinese, and living in Singapore for 4 years, we are definitely particular and picky when it comes to establishments that attempt to pass themselves off as authentic Chinese. Dragon Palace is neither authentic nor quality Chinese food.  Let's start with the positives. The food was hot, and the pre-packaged fortune cookies and almond cookies were fresh and delicious. This is pretty much all I can say positive about Dragon Palace.  One of my favorite Chinese food dishes to order is Egg Foo Young, so I had to try their Pork Egg Foo Young. After my first bite, I was convinced there was no egg used in this dish. It tasted like a bland dry floury pancake--awful. They did not use the usual thick savory brown sauce that normally accompanies Egg Foo Young, and they did not add the pork into the omelet. Instead, the overcooked grey slithers of pork were piled on top of the omelet and there was literally no sauce other than a greasy oil slick that drenched this bland dish. Egg Foo Young is an egg omelet patty, and the chefs at Dragon Palace managed to ruin an egg omelet.   We had Cashew Shrimp--another family favorite, but Dragon Palace managed to ruin that experience. The sauce was over powered in flavor by the generous use of green peppers, but that was the least of this dishes problem. The chef used two different sized shrimp, but even worse, the shrimp was not even cleaned! The shrimp still retained their gritty sand vein --otherwise known as the \"poop chute\"--gross! This is a definite indication that Dragon Palace does not use any quality assurance in their food standard practices.   The Shrimp Lo Mein and Peking Lo Mein was flavorless as was the fried rice. The meat used in both the Peking Lo Mein and Fried Rice was chewy, and it left us unsure of what type of meat it was--very off putting texture. In addition, the shrimp used in these dishes were not cleaned properly.  A big winner dish for us is always General Tso Chicken--just not at Dragon Palace. The batter coating on each morsel of chicken was soggy and not adhering to the chicken at all. The chef did not use the slightly spicy sauce that is normally used with this dish. It looked like they had just poured heaps of their red sweet and sour sauce on top of the chicken and added a few red chili peppers. We asked for it to be mild spicy, but there was not even a hint of heat in this dish.  We will never order from Dragon Palace again. It is overpriced poor quality bland food that is far from authentic Chinese or even authentic American Chinese food, and not cleaning the shrimp is a deal breaker for us--who knows what other poor standards are being practiced in this establishment.",

I ordered the Almond Chicken and not only was the serving size small, and the chicken small dark meat squares, but it was so salty that I could not eat it. I sent it back. I then ordered Chicken w snow peas. This, at least looked appetizing. But, looks were deceiving. It to was too salty.  Needles to say, I didn't eat it either. I took it home and promptly dumped it in the trash. I have no idea how this place could possibly rate 4 stars. Plus the atmosphere is horrible and the staff very unfriendly.  Give me Wok Express or Flo's anytime. I only gave it one star because the soup was OK, otherwise I wouldn't have given it any.",

    "text": "You can tell this is a real Chinese restaurant. How? Every time you go, you see the same little kid doing her homework at a small table by herself. Lol.  The food is pretty standard, but good. We were introduced to this place by friends of ours. After our favorite Chinese restaurant changed hands, we were in need of a replacement. Luckily for us, they had found this place.   It's tucked away in the corner of a shopping plaza that looks a bit deserted; pretty simple to miss if you were driving by. Once you walk in, you see this old skool cash register...straight up vintage, probably circa 1952. I definitely appreciate how clean it is. The owners take pride in their restaurant. Normally, Chinese restaurants lack both cleanliness and ambiance.   The restaurant is beautifully decorated. And the service is outstanding! The first time we went there, I asked a lady who was waiting on a to-go order what she recommended. She said the Mongolian beef, which we did order. She was right; it was good.  Full flavored, and incredibly tender beef. I was thrilled bc I was able to get honey walnut shrimp. If that's a dish you haven't tried, you are missing out. I also recommend an order of their chicken wings under \"Appetizers\".   To enjoy a sampling of their food, we'll order the family meals. Expect to leave with leftovers. I recommend the Dragon Dinner Special. The wor wonton soup that comes with it seems to differ slightly from the one offered with the Mandarin Dinner special. If you're not used to bamboo shoots, you may dislike the wor wonton soup offered with the latter.   My husband said it had a weird after taste to him. I didn't notice bc I like bamboo shoots. The next day, the flavor of the bamboo shoots was more noticeable. As a word of caution: don't order an extra meal with the family style dinners. It'll just be overkill. And, you won't have any room on the table.",

    "text": "This was my husband's second visit and my first to Dragon Palace.  The first time my husband went he came home excited about having a good Chinese place so close to us (and let me clarify that we are both American born Chinese so we love greasy Chinese food).    I love that right after we sit down they bring the tea, and there's no extra charge like a lot of Chinese restaurants these days.  This place does offer a great deal for a LOT of food -- we went with the Family Dinner special which was 11.95 a person for soup, eggroll, fried wontons, pork chow mein, fried rice, and sweet and sour pork.  By the time the entrees came around we were totally full and we ended up taking three full cartons of food home.  The service was prompt, attentive, and very friendly.    However, I thought that the food here was very difficult to eat.  The chow mein especially was really, really salty.  I never ever send food back but we had to ask for them to cook it again because it was so salty, and it wasn't much better after that.  The sweet and sour pork was deep fried pork with sweet and sour sauce drizzled over it -- not even coated evenly.  The meat itself was tough and chewy in texture.  The fried rice was decent, nothing extraordinary.  My favorite part of the meal was the dessert, they make these fried bananas wrapped in wontons that are coated with honey and they are delicious!  Since my husband had such a positive experience the first time he went, I am willing to give this place another try.  Maybe they just hired a new chef (our server said that he was also brand new) so there may be some inconsistencies in the menu.",

    "text": "2016 and Dragon Palace has, over the years become family.  It is my favorite AUTHENTIC CHINESE restaurant in an older but nicely decorated Chinese  restaurant oozing with ambiance.  Once you have been there a few times you will realize that most dishes they make are traditional Chinese.  If you like it hotter, ask for their chili paste to spice it up.  Every dish is wonderful and the servings are generous enough to eat family style and still have leftovers to take home!  The ambiance, excellent plain Chinese food and the friendly warm reception during service makes this a definite repeater!  Their pupu platter and hot and sour soup is amazing. All their dishes are delicious . The only one I don't care for is the crispy Duck.  Not bad considering all the others are amazing.  Don't think you are  getting PF Chang or you will be disappointed..  This is old school traditional Chinese.  My faves?? Last week We had hot & sour soup -soooo good with big shrimp and other meat!  Then I ordered mooshoo pork Oh and my friend ordered Pork Chow mein.  Of course we received the wonton strips with sweet & sour sauce to dip on and a fortune cookie afterwards.  If you are lucky and they have the , you will get Pisang goring (fried banana) to die for!  Although the place was filled, service was still good and attentive.  Dishes arrived promptly and were hot when served.  As always, we never felt rushed and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly.  Definitely the TO GO PLACE for traditional Chinese cuisine!  Update:  AUG 2016 Still my FAVORITE traditional Chinese food restaurant - and it's local for me!  Consistently GOOD, generous portions and quick friendly service! Great for take/out also. Life is GOOD!",

    "text": "I just had the worst experience at a restaurant ever!! Not only did my mother and I get an attitude from all the employees the moment we sat down but we were being rushed thru our dinner. We ordered the Peking dinner for two with a side of assorted veggies and all of our food was brought at pretty much at the same time. Pu pu platter was brought out then immediately the soup was brought out. I had time to eat one item off my pu pu platter when the veggies followed immediately by the house special chicken were brought out. After asking why we were being rushed the owner said \"no rush\" and took the chicken and veggies back. After having a chance to catch up to the food on the table, the platter and the soup, they brought out the chicken and veggies. Which were barely room temp but then again it was pretty cold inside there so I will say ice cold. They asked us what we wanted to do and we told them leave because they had ruined our Christmas Eve dinner which had been a tradition of going out for Chinese since my Grandparents were alive and I was a young kid. After completely ruining our dinner they demanded us to pay for the pu pu platter and soup. We paid for it all the while listening to every excuse as to why we were getting an attitude and being rushed thru our meal. I have been going to this restaurant 25+ yrs and have never had this kind of service. I will never step foot in this place ever again!! They actually deserve no star at all!!",

I love the banana fritter (???? - someone posted a pic of this - not sure of the name) that comes at the end of the meal.  We both love the hot tea that is served with each meal and we always order the egg drop soup.  One of my faves is the beef skewer.  It's beef on a stick that comes out on this thing with fire underneath it so you heat the skewer how you like.  I'm not sure what to call that thing but I love to get my skewers sizzling hot.  I keep trying new items each time I go and some of faves are the Orange Chicken, Pepper Steak and Sesame Chicken.  They serve it with a pot of white rice.  Each dinner entree is served on an oval plate and is enough food for at least two people....more if you eat small.  I always have leftovers, as I order the entrees for myself (hubby eats Shrimp Fried Rice always).  Service is always super fast so you won't have to wait too long for your food.  The staff is nice and the decor is a very cozy Chinese look.  This a little gem in our neighborhood.  See you there!",
