Yummy garlic bread, really good chicken noodle soup and a wonderful Cesar dressing. Tempting wine list. Mini canollis, made in house, were wonderful. The lunch special was the perfect size. We will be back with the rest of the family. It looks like they do a big take out biz too. The restaurant also is amazingly decorated.",

The meals were outstanding and service was great.  Our waitress was very friendly and did her best to be on top of things.  Also, when we asked about her favorite meal she was very quick at responding to her favorite.  I hate it when we ask and they say \"well\" and give a cop out answer.  Everything was great aside from the French bread it was a little too cold.  Wasn't stale but it would be nice if they were warm.  Otherwise I recommend this place for anyone who likes Italian food.  Also, found it strange they had teriyaki chicken on the menu.  Everything was in line, but teriyaki chicken?",

I usually order the sausage and pepperoni pizza, with a side of their amazingly crunchy and perfectly sauced wings. The pizza is slightly greasier than other pizza places I've been to, but it doesn't detract from the fulfilling taste. I've also noticed that it lacks sauce (which I don't like anyway) and is replaced with a little more cheese (which I LOVE, but who doesn't??).",

For take out for two, we generally order the small 10 inch Hawaiian pizza and two dinner salads with Italian dressing. $22 plus tip. Price a little hiGh but Worth a little more for a consistently excellent pizza. We ask for the pizza well done because typically our pizza gets soggy in the center.  I would definitely recommend Anzio's for their pizza.",

But theirs is the greasy, fake tasting crap like you get in the frozen section at the grocery store!  The salads are basically non-descript piles of white iceberg lettuce with some mozzarella on top.   My buddy had lasagna which the sauce was a bit on the sweet side for my tastes, and I had a personal sausage pizza which I thought the dough had a good flavor.  A bit on the oily side, much more so than necessary. So, although we thought the food was nothing special I will give them props for the reasonable prices and friendly staff.",

She had the wings which she said are \"always crispy and delicious.\"  I don't eat wings - but I will take her word for it!  I had a grilled cheese on rye with fries (yes, at an Italian restaurant) and it was GREAT.  Crispy, wonderful warm fries and a grilled cheese toasted to perfection.  Great lunch prices and the big lunch rush to match and indicate that the food IS tasty.  Can't wait to go back and have some \"real\" Italian.",

We didn't really want Olive Garden as we try to avoid chains but we were in the area so stopped in to OG and the wait was 45 min and we had no desire to wait.  By good luck we ended up here.  All we had to wait for was them to wipe down a booth.   We ordered the cheese sticks for app.  They were definitely homemade and the Kid loved them.  Came with 6 or 7 good sized sticks and marinara sauce to dip.  I ordered the spinach, chicken, Apple, walnut, feta, salad with the red wine dressing on the side.  It was very good and the spinach was fresh.  It also had a good amount of chicken.  I would order it again.  It came with 4 pieces of bread which was more than plenty.  The bread was buttery and garlicky and tasty but I only had 1 piece (It's bikini season:).  The guys got a extra thick crust 13 inch pizza with sausage, meatballs, and extra cheese.  They really liked it and it was plenty big for 2 and we took half home.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  I partially rate staff on if we have to ask for refills and we never had to.  Its a cute, casual restaurant and good size.  Good place to take the family.  We will definitely return.  Total was $44 before tip and that was the app, pizza, salad, and 2 root beers.",

    "text": "Really? Really, Schott? As Good As It Gets?  Yup!  That's Anzio's. Now to start the story, I belong to a fine dining club, and we go to a new place on the first Friday of each month. My Fiance and I find its a great date night to go and dine with our friends.   Well, with that said, our host Nick, arranged for the Club to meet at Anzio's this last Friday.  Lucky for us, Anzio's has a private room hidden in the back, that could easily hold 40 hungry folks. (Although we were only 20, we ate like we were 40). First, let's talk about the ambiance, Yes its charming, cozy and has all the little Italian accessories you would expect and more. The service was terrific and the food better. When it came time to order, we couldn't decide, so we ordered the combination with Pasta Alfredo, Lasagna, and Chicken-Parm. Not good...BUT GREAT. The Alfredo sauce was light and tasty. The lasagna, and its hard to say this, Yes, True, as good as Mom's... hope she doesn't read this review. The chicken-parm... awesome.   Now, without my dining club, I would never have stumbled across Anzio's. Its in a strip center. Nothing really special about the area, so it needs to be a destination. Again, fortunately, it has a private room, because the waiting line was all the way into the parking lot, which was also full, but don't let that discourage you, plenty of parking all around, and they work at getting you seated fast.   Now how good was it really? Well, we told Mom and Dad all about it, and they went today (which is Monday, just 3 days after we went.) It's important to note that Mom and Dad are from Chicago, so they are \"dialed in\" to great Italian. The question on your mind is this, What did they think?... Final Answer: They loved it, and Dad said, as good as it gets.   Give yourself a treat, and go to Anzio's. Lunches are a deal at about $8 average, and dinner entrees start about $11. ..and worth every penny. See you there, 'cause we are goin' back again soon!",

We were seated in a booth and it was a tight fit, not much room there. Next time we go we'll sit at a table. Ordered a basket of cheese garlic bread and wine. Wine good and cheese bread very good. When ordering our dinners the menu said it came with bread. We didn't realize the bread is an entire basket of bread. We had lots of bread. Next time we'll forego the cheese bread appitizer and get something else.  As for the entrees, they were all excellent. Generous portions, we had traditional spaghetti and meatballs, feticini Alfredo and chicken and broccoli which came with pasta in an Alfredo sause. Really good, all of it. Service was very good and prices very reasonable. This is a homey, casual place, very comfortable. As we left, there were about one dozen people standing outside waiting to be called for their table. A very nice find and will definately be back.",

Best lasagna I have ever had anywhere. Their pizza is also exceptionally good, and I even love the table bread they bring out with your entrees. I've read a couple reviews on here complaining about service. Listen, it's not a 5-star joint, and that's not the clientele they serve. Still I have always found their service to be just as good as the food. If you want great Italian food, family friendly atmosphere, and family-friendly prices, you won't find anyplace better than Anzio's.",

Very thin cracker crust and an over powering amount of oregano. The kids pizza was more of a traditional pizza and was very good.  The comped us an icecream for being first time customers.  Thought that was very nice.  Also want to add that the website prices were not updated with their current menu and prices were different.",

We ordered the combination platter (which includes chicken parm, lasagna and fetticini alfredo) as well as the manacotti entree. Both came with your choice of soup or salad and garlic bread. We selected a Caesar salad and some kind of beef and vegetable soup. We were told it would be ready in 20 minutes.  Hubby went and picked up the food and described the inferior as a mom and pop kind of place. It was still piping hot when he returned home. Plus! The soup was hearty and flavorful, I highly recommend it. The manicotti was decent, a nice blend of ricotta and parmesan rolled into perfectly cooked noodles topped with their delicious marinara. The chicken parm was by far the beater. Very tender and breaded perfectly. Their lasagna was also quite tasty and I was suprised by the generous portion we recieved. The fetticini was tasty, their sauce tasted home made and had a nice flavor to it. The garlic bread was fresh, buttery and delicious. I would recommend ordering extra if you like to sop up your sauce as you eat.   I'll definitely be going back to try their pizza and will update this review when I do!",

Questioned the waiter and manager about the extra charges. They stated, sorry but that's the way it is... In addition, Anzio's would not honor Groupon because it's a \"daily special\", even though it's on Anzio's main menu. Also BEWARE, Anzio's will not honor Groupon on ANY specials from their main menu, includeing the lunch menu that's on the back of their main menu. Just another prime example of BAD WAITER, MANAGEMENT, COMMUNICATION AND BUSINESS SKILLS...",

    "text": "First time was Saturday eve close to 5:00.  I had a craving for Italian in neighborhood.  We try to stay away from chains so this seemed like interesting choice.  Stares from huge staff.  Table for 3.  We wee sat in booth against window.  Surprised by cute (now new or elegant but clean) decor.  Our menus were laminated and easy to read.  The lamented children's menu was torn at edge but also easy to read.    Drinks were Sprite, water and milk.  No appetizer for us as most options were fried.  Husband was not in mood for Italian so his meal was fish and fries.  My child - pizza.  Manicotti for me.  The description of house blended ricotta and provolone sounded interesting.  Came with soup or salad.  I opted for house salad.  Chicken noodle - ick.  Now, I would have upgraded for a Caesar but I asked if they made own croutons or dressing and that was an obvious negative.  Decided in blue cheese as our server said they did make own blue.  That salad came out FAST!  It's $4 in its own and sadly it seemed just bagged lettuce with carrot shreds & 3-4 box crotons.  There were a few long shreds of cheese (nice touch) but it was waxy and flavorless - provolone?  The dressing really lacked blue cheese flavor.  Just low grade mayo with a few lumps.  I expected more.  Cherry tomatoes and cucumber, perhaps?    Waited a bit  longer than what we'd expected but that is fine esp if they are creating all dishes made to order.  The place began filling up.  People were waiting outside!    My pasta and daddy's fish came out first.  My child had to wait for his pizza.  I have never had that happen.  The child is always served first. My plate was HOT out of oven.  Pizza was hot too!  Good thing.  Both of our meals were just good.  Good as in everything about my plate was fine.  Cheese as expected.  Pasta was a wee thick.  I love it when it is paper thin.  Red sauce may have been reduced canned.  I would have loved a garnish of fresh green parsley and maybe lemon wedge.  It was seasoned well.  Pizza was a good size for a child.  Housemate dough?  Smelled nice and yeasty.  $12 for the three rolls of manicotti.  Around $30 all said and done.  Nice staff.  They DO become busy.  Local folks must LOVE it here.  It was mush better than what I remember about Olive Garden.  There is some personality here.  We may come in again if we really crave (not cheap but not expensive) Italian close by.",

It's in an older part of town right next to a auto store.  When we walked in, they pointed us to the area where the party was.  It was a long hall-way and opened up into this huge room!  From the front of the restaurant you wouldnt think it was there.  By the way, the place was packed.  Service was great with drinks and  since it was a big party, they had two choices of food: lasagna and chicken alfredo, along with some garlic bread and salad.  The salad was just a basic garden salad, but the ingridents were fresh and it was deliscious!  I opted to have both the chicken alfredo and the lasagna and I wasnt sorry one bit.  It was the most delicious tasting italian food I think I have ever eaten at a restaurant.    My girlfriend lookd over and said to me.. \"I could eat 4 more plates, but Im so stuffed\"  I replied \"I would love to get sick here\"  It was THAT good.  I highly recommend this food and even though we live in Scottsdale, we WILL be back.  Incredible service and food!",

Just didn't have a lot of flavor. Nothing at all tasted homemade. It all tasted like run of the mill restaurant supply food. The waitress and host were very, very friendly. The food was kinda blah. I do not recommend this place for first dates, or even dinner. It's very loud. It's well prepared bar food. Good for lunches maybe. I could be wrong about the not homemade issue, but I doubt it. Stuff just came to quickly. You could tell it was nuked. We did not try the pizza. I will not be going back.",

Hate it when you go somewhere and the plate is full of water. Consistently well drained pasta plates with hearty sauces.  Also love the hot sandwiches. Pizza and wings are an old favorite for years and always good for the big groups. Recently had the veal parm, tender with nice flavor but the breading just wasn't there. Soggy as it got to the table....but hey what can you expect when you put sauce on breading. Next time I think I'm going to ask for the cheese to be melted on top and sauce on the side.  It was still darn good.  Been coming here for years and years and years and so have people from the local neighborhood....it's like Cheers....but better.",

    "text": "This review is for the service and management. Great food, disappointing service and management. I was craving toasted ravioli. I brought guests with me to introduce them to my one of my favorite foods in the valley. The server was quick to serve us even though it was a crowded Friday night. We ordered 3 toasted raviolis, one grilled chicken fettuccine Alfredo, and a cinnamon bread sundae.  Clue one that there might have been a problem. \"Would you like soup or salad?\" I responded, \"I thought we'd only have 1 salad.\" Server, \"Oh, you ordered 3 raviolis and 1 fettucine, that is four salads.\" The toasted ravioli's were off the appetizer section, but I thought that they were being generous.  Caesar salads were great. The dressing is homemade. Shaved Parmesan and crunchy crouton garnish was lovely.   After a wait, which on a crowded Friday night was understandable, our meal arrived. Our waitress brought out boiled ravioli and not toasted ravioli. \"This is not what I ordered. We came here for toasted ravioli.\" Our server was not happy. She took it back. Then returned.   \"Well, it's going to be a wait.\"  \"That's fine with us because we love the toasted ravioli and came tonight specifically for that dish.\" My guests told me that she looked really unhappy. We enjoyed our fettucine Alfredo, the sauce is incredible. I didn't care for the grilled chicken. She returned again.  \"Well, do you want your ice cream now?\"  \"Sure.\" We all agreed that we didn't mind eating out of order.  \"The ravioli is going to be a while. The fryers are all tied up.\"  Shortly, the toasted ravioli arrived. \"I guess it was faster that I thought.\"  The cinnamon bread sundae was heavenly. Crunchy chunks of cinnamon with vanilla ice cream sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and caramel topped with whipped cream. The toasted ravioli was heavenly. The meat filled ones were flavorful. The ricotta cheese is rich and fluffy. The baked cheese over the marinara is the bomb!  Sadly, the bill was deflating. \"We had to charge you for the salads.\" To add insult to injury, they charged me 4 salads, one should have come with the fettuccine. When they wanted to stick this to me, they should have said something when they were taking the boiled raviolis. I was too embarrassed by our treatment that I uncharacteristically did not ask for management. This is our second time coming to Anzio's. I love the food which I would give 4 to 5 stars, but I have always left with a poor taste in my mouth as I think about their customer service.",

Every time I order Anzios I'm told a certain amount of time, I typically give an additional five minutes just to be safe. Yet every time I end up waiting and additional 15 minutes to pick up my order. On top of that the last three times my order has been wrong. The first time they caught it as they gave it to me and fixed it. But the last two times I wasn't aware until I got home that they had given me the wrong sauce. May seem trivial to some; however, when you are expecting Alfredo and get marinara it kind of ruins the meal.",

However there was clearly one open and 2 other booths were clearly leaving right at that time. So we sat at a table because I was trying to not be a pain in the butt on date night. Lol  I ordered  the lobster ravioli and my boyfriend ordered the shrimp Alfredo. His shrimp were overcooked and the sauce was acidic in a bad way with no flavor.

Surprisingly the place wasn't that busy, the 7 of us sat in the middle of the dining room but still have in view of the TV's in the small bar area to watch playoff football.  Drink order taken and a few minutes when are young waitress returned she took our order. We opted for the pizza and wing special with the addition of a meat lovers pizza. I ordered a cup of chicken noodle soup.  Pepperoni pizza delivered along with our 30 wings. 10 medium, great sauce. Not too spicy with the traditional vinegar tang. 10 BBQ, run of the mill. 10 sweet and spicy, I don't really know how to describe these wings, but sweet and spicy. Tang and spiciness of the medium but with a hint of sweetness. Really good. Meat lovers delivered shortly there after.  Pepperoni pizza is pepperoni pizza. The meat lovers is another story. Loaded with toppings, finely diced sausage and bacon with cheese that was a golden brown  The soup, clearly homemade but lacking in something.  Kids meals reasonably priced starting at $5.25  This is a great local mom and pop restaurant and they have a large back room for banquets and meetings. Service was good, nothing spectacular but for the young waitstaff it will do.",

We finally went on a Friday night, and we ended up being very underwhelmed. When we arrived, there was a short wait for a table, and the entrance was packed, so we had to ask if there was any other place to wait, and the hostess suggested the bar area in back - - I would have expected that to be suggested without even asking. Our bartender was nice enough, but I felt my old fashioned was an underpour, especially for $8.  Our table was ready quickly, so we went to be seated. We each ordered the combination plates and ministrone soup. The soup was bland and lukewarm. Our meals were ok, but nothing special. I know everything is homemade, but didn't come across as such, more like it was processed. We had to ask the waiter for our garlic bread, which is supposed to come with our meals. No cheese is offered to go with our meals. In the end, we were glad we at least didn't pay full price for the meals. Until we find a different place, we agree that our favorite Italian restaurant in Northern Phoenix continues to be Times Square, by a longshot.",

Anzio's was the first to show up on google and after reading all the reviews we couldn't wait to try it. To our surprise everything we read was TRUE... It was absolutely amazing. The dishes are also big enough to split if you don't eat large portions .We split the combination dinner which had Lasagna, Fettuccini Alfred, and Chicken Parmigiana. The desserts were not a disappointment either. We choose the Strawberry Shortcake which was made right there by Sana our waitress which by the way was great. While we were waiting Casey the owners Son came out and took some time to chat with us and give us some history on the restaurant and its food. We can't wait to come back and try their other dishes and dessert. Wish we knew about you guys 30 years earlier .",

It was a Saturday night and the place was full but we didn't have to wait too long.   This truly is a hole in the wall, Mom and pop type of place.  And sometimes, that's a good thing.  The decor is adorable.  Besides the tv's one might feel like they're in Italy.  We started with the toasted ravioli.  It was delicious.  Love the sweet marinara they serve it with.  All our pasta entrees were quite good as well.  Nothing fancy, just really good tasting homemade Italian food.  We were stuffed, but oh so tempted to try the banana Nutella cheesecake. I listened to my gut (literally) and opted not to.  I will for sure have to come back.  Their desert menu looks heavenly!",

My friend tried the chicken and broccoli and it fell a little under expectations.  The garlic bread was amazing which had that hard-to-find crunchy and chewy combo!  We also tried the cherry cheesecake which was phenomenal.  Great way to end the meal!  Very nice casual to nice atmosphere.",

    "text": "I have been going to Anzios for years and their food is very good.  However, after last night I assure you that my family will not return. We ordered the cheesy garlic bread and a pizza. My 13 year old son was eating the cheesy garlic bread when he bit into something hard. I saw him spit out the bit and he stated he bit something hard. He finally cleaned it off and it was a piece of thick glass. The waitress quickly took it back to the kitchen and another lady came over to make sure my son was not hurt and didn't suffer a broken tooth, which he had not. We had them remove the cheesy garlic bread from the table. They offered to make us a pizza to go, which we declined, then they offered us a free dessert. My son of course took the dessert. We remained calm throughout the entire experience. As we paid the bill and btw they charged us for that cheesy garlic bread, the Chef (?) came to the table and thanked us however he was oblivious  that the piece of glass came from the cheesy garlic bread and said he was told it had come from the pizza. This was not a case of getting the wrong order, this was a piece of glass that my child bit into. Not only could he have broke a tooth, he could have swallowed it which would be a lot worse. And if you have one piece of broken glass in your food, chances are very high that there's more. Very disturbing, the fact that there was so little concern on their part that they paid no attention when we told not one but two waitresses what my son had bit into after handing them the cheesy garlic bread to remove from the table.",

I was scared at first to try their marinara because they are from Ohio, and Ohio people put strange things in there tomato sauce like cumin or cinnamon, crazy huh? But this place did not disappoint and the marinara was great. My wife had lasagna which was very yummy and I had a chicken parmesan hero. The kids had linguini in anice Alfredo, which they love to eat. I was afraid to try the pizza though because they only use provolone they don't even carry mozzarella in the restaurant. The specialty pizzas did look yummy on th. menu so maybe I will give it a try next time. This seems like a nice little neighborhood joint hidden away on 28th Drive.",

I don't know that I would drive out to Metro Center just to eat here, but if I was in the area, it would definitely be on the list.",

    "text": "Great food! Comfortable and wonderful dining area. Sloooow service.  I've driven past here a lot of times since I live in the area and the parking lot always seems to have a lot of cars in it. Don't be fooled!  We decided to go on a Tues night about 7:30 and typical amount of cars, but found a spot up front and grabbed it. Went inside and saw a lot of empty tables. Had to wait to be seated ... and waited, and waited. Lots of servers walking around, but couldn't understand who they were serving since I'd say only a quarter of the tables had customers, and why the full parking lot???  Eventually someone came from their back bar area and we were seated. Waited for our server ... and waited, and waited. Couldn't understand the delays with the service since she only had one other table. Eventually got our order in, and I will say the food came out quickly compared to the rest of our experience. Again, food was great, and while sitting there, realized the other servers were cleaning tables and floors, assuming that was their task at the end of their shift.  Will certainly order take out meals, or if I want to have a very \"casual\" meal with nothing else going on, which is fine sometimes. But don't think I'd consider taking a large group.",

The restrooms are very clean and the staff were all very friendly and attentive. The food in my opinion was just ok. I had the lobster ravioli and I felt the sauce was good and creamy but after a few bites it was just to heavy. The fettuccine Alfredo was good and the shrimp were pretty decent size. It was good it just left a weird aftertaste that I couldn't really get the feel for what it was. My husband had the spaghetti and he compared it to the old spaghetti factory which I am not a fan of so I can't say that it was good, although I didn't try it. They had coke products and accept Amex which is always a plus for me. I'm not sure if I would come back because the food was ok it just didn't leave me wanting more. Maybe next time I will give their wings and pizza a try.",

    "text": "This is a reality check review.   Anzios is a decent enough place with decent enough food but these 4/5 star reviews must be paid for.   I consider this place more of an Italian diner with a large enough menu to satisfy most. Emphasis on Italian food but not exclusively Italian... (see cheesy fries with bacon or burgers)   Ample parking  Service isn't bad but it's just mediocre like everything else.   They have a very sweet red sauce. If you want a dense home made style red sauce this isn't it. Maybe they make it but it tasted canned.   Sent the lasagne back because it tasted like desert pasta   Veal parm was pounded piece of something over breaded and under seasoned. Breaded shoe leather.. No creativity.   Friend ordered small pizza.. Ate 1 slice..waiter didn't say anything at all even when he didn't want to pack up the extra to take home. A little better customer service goes a long way  Dining area was nice and not loud or over crowded   This is likely a very good daytime lunch neighborhood place. However for 4 at dinner, we went here based on yelp reviews, it was weak. There is really nothing special here.   Best reaction: meh",

They put out lots of coupons on Groupon and Entertainment but then don't want to honor them. We've been told it is for dine-in only even when the coupon doesn't specify. We were told wings don't count as an entree despite costing about what the other entrees cost. Then when we ordered a pizza with one half different from the other, it didn't count for their 50% off coupon. And just lately with a coupon that says \"buy one entree and get a second complimentary entree up to 8 dollars\" the woman insisted we only get the second entree for 50% off. What? So we got $4 off instead. If you are going to draw in customers with coupons, you should honor them and not make up rules to keep from giving what the coupons state. Bad business. Makes us want to go elsewhere.",

I called ahead to be put on the list and we only waited for 5 minutes on a Friday night. Our server was very attentive & the food came out quickly. We had a mix of pasta, salad & grilled cheese for dinner, as well as toasted raviolis & garlic bread! Definitely a great experience that didn't break the bank. Spent a couple hours eating & visiting, we appreciated that we weren't rushed out even though we were there for a while. Our drinks were never low & we never had to ask for anything.  Finished the meal with a chocolate chip calzone! Sooo sweet & so delicious",

    "text": "Came here with my husband for dinner tonight. It was about 6:30pm on a Friday night and there was about a 10 minute wait before we could be sat. The Host asked if it was our first time dining and we said yes. He said they give free dessert if it's your first time there (we never received free dessert, nor did our server even ask if we wanted dessert). The wine was decent, I had the Chianti, my husband had the merlot. We started with Toasted Cheese Ravioli. The Ravioli were really good, the sauce...not so much. It's very thick and very sweet. Also had sort of a metalic taste, canned maybe?? Oh, it also had a giant slice of barely melted provolone cheese atop the marinara (think deli sliced provolone for sandwiches), this just made it awkward to try and eat the sauce. For our meals I had the baked rigatoni with marinara. Fail on my part as it was the same sauce that was served with the Raviolis. Blech! I ate half and decided it wasn't worth the calories finishing it. My husband had the Eggplant Parm. He said it was bland and not a whole lot of flavor. Our server cleared our plates and dropped the check. Not even a word of dessert was mentioned. We weren't even concerned about getting it free, we couldn't even get it at all. I do believe however, if you're going to mention it, you should follow through! All in all this place did not wow us. For 2 glasses of wine, Toasted Ravioli app, baked rigatoni and eggplant parm our bill was $50 bucks. Not too bad but so not worth it. On a side note I need to mention how distracting it was seeing both a server (stocky male, facial hair, longer hair slicked back) and a female busser (reddish curly hair up in a bun) chewing gum! Gross, spit it out!! There were also quite a few female employees with longer hair, past their shoulders not pulled back in a pony tail. To me this says this place does not care about sanitation and for that alone, I will not return.",

It started off great, our waitress even brought out some watermelon for our boys to eat while we were waiting on the food. The 1st thing they brought out was the pizza, which we ordered thin crust because we like it crunchy. Well, it wasn't at all, it was soft, greasy pizza. Then my boyfriends spaghetti came, the meat sauce was a little sweet & the meatballs had way to much bread filler & no flavor. Some things are better homemade I guess. I ordered some chicken wings which they brought out & gave to the wrong table so I had to wait for them to make more which wasn't that big of a deal because it gave me time to get everyone else situated. The garlic bread was stale & over buttered and it almost tasted like they used old butter. Really upsetting, hopefully just a fluke.....",

Basically a step below Olive Garden in both quality and price. Not bad but not great either. Decent.",

There is a great area in the back for private parties that you wouldn't even know about unless someone told you or you got lucky enough to be invited to one.  Great for groups and families.",

This used to be a place that my family and I could go to when we wanted to sit down and enjoy an amazing italian meal. I love the breaded french fries and pizza, however, lately its been less and less satisfying upon every visit. The last time I went there will be the last time period. A couple of my girlfriends and I went in to grab some pizza and subs before shopping, I insisted we go here and assured everyone they would enjoy it. WRONG! our service was terrifying, took forever to get noticed, get drinks,and our food took almost 40 minutes not even kidding. When we asked the waitress about the delay she was very rude and snooty, when we spoke to the manager it didnt get any better AT ALL, we didn't even recieve an apology. Once the food arrived it was COLD!!!! SO who knows how long it had been sitting there. SUCH A JOKE! never going back.",

I get you close in 30 minutes and are chit chatting but I don't want to hear your conversations. Took forever for the server to clear the plates, we waited 15 minutes for the bill to come. We were ready to go! On the way out the door, saw the sever socializing at the bar with co workers. I get it's the end of your shift, but give me good service.

Thought the meat sauce on the rigatoni had a little too intense tomato flavor. Garlic bread was good but not very garlicky.  Another note-when we were led to our table we had to walk past, trying to avoid, a bunch of food on the carpet. Very unappetizing and was not picked up or vacuumed up while we were there.",

Yesterday after a long day my wife and I decided to hit up our favorite Italian food restaurant.. When we got there around 3:30 or so, we walked in, the wait staff saw us walk in and sit down (per the sign at the entrance to seat yourself).. It took 18 minutes for one of the wait staff to come and give us a menu... The young man (waiter) and our waitress were bickering about who would take our table... I tried to be formal and decent and not say anything since we have been coming here for many many many years... after we got the menu, another 14 minutes passed by before she came to ask us if we were ready to order... took another 15 minutes for our cold dinner to get brought over to us.... Seems odd that we were served so dismissively and uninterested in our food and experience... the same was felt by the group who sat down next to us, as they looked at us with a frowned look while they waited for their menu as and drinks as well..... I don't like to complain to the waitress, and we always Tip very generously, but she ignored us when we walked in, took forever to bring a menu, drinks and the food..... Sad that after many many many years,  we will not be going back because of how she treated us...",

    "text": "Anzio's is a casual, family restaurant so, since it was too hot to cook, we felt comfortable heading there in shorts. Have you ever noticed how much better even the simplest things taste when you don't have to prepare them? The house salad consisted of fresh crisp lettuce, carrots and some cheese and croutons on top, served on a chilled plate. It's so nice to start a meal with something basic that was perfectly prepared--no wilted or past their prime greens, and just the right amount. I couldn't resist, I had to try the wonderful bread. In fact I \"tried\" it again and again. I'm not a huge pasta fan but my husband's chicken parmigiana with spaghetti certainly met with his approval. I ordered the baked cod. The portion of fish was large (the size of my hand) seasoned and cooked perfectly. I rarely have anything good to say about restaurant veggies. They are either close to raw and too crunchy or cooked to a consistency more suitable for nursing home patients. The ramekin of broccoli and carrots had just enough \"chew\" but not mushy, so I really enjoyed it. Since chocolate comes from the cocoa BEAN, I can only assume that the chocolate ganache cheesecake counts as both dairy and a vegetable and a great way to end a meal. With that rationale, I all but licked my plate! I enjoy this place. The atmosphere (sometimes noisy) makes you feel like you are at your  Italian grandma's. It's a comfortable place to bring kids (lots of families), no one is rushed and service is attentive. There were a lot of really great looking pizzas being served and that's what we are planning on for our next visit.",

I had the chicken parmesan, melted in my mouth.  Not thickly breaded., flavorful breadcrumbs.   Their garlic toast is incredible and is their marinara.",

Place was amazing! I had the manicotti, which I had never even tried before in my life! It was so delicious! This place beats Olive Garden! Our server was Carolina, and she was a wonder server. She even gave us some free Ice cream since it was my first time! We live in Tempe and wish we lived closer, but now I know when we are on that side of town, we will be coming here to eat!",

The restaurant is pretty clean, and the decorations are very inviting and nice.

The food was okay, but very underseasoned- my shrimp pasta tasted mainly of butter. The garlic bread was also soaked in butter. Honestly, the best part of the meal was the side salad.  Overall, the decor was great, the service was great, but the food just fell flat for me and my husband, although I am spoiled by authentic italian cooking.",

I've tried the buffalo chicken pizza, make your own pizza with spinach, mushroom, and chicken,  the pasta with chicken and broccoli, lasagna, chicken parm, fettuccine Alfredo, and the chicken Caesar salad. I have a hard time deciding which to choose each time and there's more I'm dying to try!  If you're on this side of town, make sure you stop in! Ohhhh and the canolis!! Holy canolis!!! I'm no expert by any means, but Anzio's makes the best one I've ever had!!!  Great. Now I want to go get one!  I've posted a few pictures also.",

I want to hear Italian music and not top 40. The music just didn't fit the ambiance of the place. In fact it ruined it for me. The second reason is the slow service. We stood at the hostess station for several minutes before a waitress came and seated us.  That's a big issue. There should ALWAYS be somebody at that station to assist the customers. Other than that it is really well worth your time.",

Further, I, myself, can cook very good Italian food based on my exposure to my family.  My wife and I went to Anzios  mainly because we've driven past it a number of times, we had a credit with Groupon and wanted eat out.  Eggplant Parmigiana - Eggplant was cut to thick and slightly undercooked. The pasta was cooked well but the sauce lacked any direction.  Side salad - basically a small potion of lettuces and shaved carrots on a plate.  Meatball Hero - Sauce was bland. Meatballs were small, tasted like meat and bread crumbs, were heavy and lacked any real flavor. While the sauce on the meatball hero was different than the eggplant parmigiana it too was bland and lacked direction.  Because of my history with Italian food I deliberately avoid \"Italian\" restaurants and if I do go to one I set my expectations pretty low. While the food was fair I don't think I will be going back to Anzios.",

It was not fresh at all and had probably sat out for awhile waiting to be warmed up with sauce for each order. Or possibly stuck in the oven to bake with the entrees. Regardless, not the way to serve spaghetti. The sauce was good but not nearly enough of it to make up for the dry spaghetti. The chicken in Chicken Parmesan was consistently over cooked among the three orders at our table. The eggplant in one dish was mushy. We asked for bread with our salads but did not get it until just before the entrees were served. On the plus side, the service was good. Pizza and wings seem to be what Anzio's does best. Pasta dishes not so much.",

What really impressed me besides all the fresh made ingredients like the sausage an lasagna was the  outstanding service.

All for 46 dollars this is the type of hidden gem that you want to keep under wraps for yourself but just have to share. My family will be back I know for certain couldn't find one thing that I didn't throughly enjoy. I'm sure my leftovers will only last a few hours as I just ate an want more.",

Not just the art on the walls but the flooring, the curtains, the way the rooms are sectioned off.. it's just a great use of the space that they have.   The tables have always been clean and the booths have amble cushion that make your dining experience very pleasant. The bathrooms are down a long hallway that are far enough away from the dining area that you don't need to be concerned about unpleasant smells or sounds interrupting your dinner.   The food. The food is amazing. The salads have always been fresh and the drinks have always been on point. Every entree option that I have ordered from the pizza to the lobster ravioli has been a delight to the eyes and the aroma just makes your mouth water. Then you take a bite. That first bite will make you close your eyes in awe and have you slowing down to savor each fork full.   The service has always been stellar. Every wait staff member that we have had has been prompt, attentive, and friendly. The hostess was there to seat us immediately and the managers were amazing. It is very easy to see how much they care about their restaurant and their customers. Their use of social media like yelp and Groupon to expand their business really shows their intellect in helping their business thrive without having to break out of that mom and pop feel.   My best friend and I went here tonight for dinner and not only was our dining experience amazing but when we stopped to let the manager know how happy we were, he took the time to speak to us about the details of our time there and show us the back banquet hall when we expressed interest for company events.  The hall would be the most perfect place for a small wedding or company conference event.  To say the least this has become one of my favorite places to visit regularly and I hope you stop in to see what it is all about.",

The sauce was just not flavorful and either was the chicken. I got the chicken parmesan and I honestly make it better at home. The breading had no flavor, a little salt goes a long way. The breading simply slid right off when I cut it. I got three small chicken breast, but it was enough. The spaghetti was just a few bites though, so way more chicken than spaghetti. My husband ordered spaghetti and meatballs and he only got two of them and they were medium size. The salad was small but ok. The fried zucchini we had as an appetizer was good, but once again lacked any real flavor. Good thing I love zucchini. The waitress was great but it took awhile for our food. It was packed in there and we were sat in a kind of weird corner. The staff had to keep ducking around this small corner wall cause the tables were close together. The staff could barely move from table to table. And it was a little annoying to get asked by every staff member how was everything like every 5 mins. Good service, but come on you keep interrupting and making it less enjoyable. For the price I have been to a couple other places that were way better with bigger portions.",

I also love the antipasti salad!! The garlic parmesan bread that they give out with the meals is mouthwatering and worth going in just for that alone!  The menu is pretty large so you have several options to feed your craving. The portions are great for sharing but also great for one person who's decently hungry.   The building has a small bar that can seat about 7 but the dining area is split in two which is great if you want to have a large party. They have both booths and tables which are both very comfortable. You can always count on seeing off duty officers or local firefighters enjoying a meal here (always makes me feel safe).

After searching for days, we met with Barbara at Anzio's and immediately knew we had found the venue.  There were plenty of restaurants to choose from, but none had the personal service and \"go the extra mile\" attitude that Barbara and your team had.  Not only did Barbara have great ideas, but she went above and beyond to accommodate any special requests we had from the linens to the plates to the decor.  Barbara made us feel and treated us like family, and I can't tell you how important that was to us.    All future family events will be at Anzio's because Barbara was the icing on the cake to an already fantastic place.  Thank you for being a business of integrity and great customer service.  Places like Anzio's are hard to find, and when you find it, you want everyone to know!  Thank you for being \"Phoenix's Best\".  It's a title you've truly earned!",

The food was delicious and even their salad dressings are made in the restaurant. The only downfall was that the red sauce was a little bland and Maggie said that she brought me creamy Italian dressing when it was actually ranch. But it was still delicious and I was very happy with it. Oh, and I didn't like that combination platter I ordered had the alfredo dish sandwhiched between the two red sauce dishes and I did not like that I didn't get to enjoy my alfredo sauce because it had red sauce mixed almost entirely throught. It should come on a separate plate, or at least offered to be plated separately. The atmosphere is awesome and everything is very clean. The garlic bread is delicious. Overall, great find!",

The server seemed like she was in a hurry and that we were an inconvenience to her. My water was filled once in the hour we were there and my friends water was not ever filled. We were provided one basket of bread. We had asked for more but it never did come. Overall an experience that I would not repeat.   The food was excellent it's sad the service was not. We will be going to Olive Garden the next time she is feeling Italian.",

I ordered the lasagna lunch for $10. It comes with a crisp salad with shredded carrots, croutons, and cheese. There was also a choice of minestrone soup. the lasagna was quite large, see the picture, and extremely tasty. The sauce is kind of a sweet tomato flavor. The service from Sarah was absolutely on point. The owner / manager came out and helped a little bit also and made sure everything went well. Everyone's drink glasses stayed full. other people at our table had the rigatoni lunch special that looked excellent, the personal mini pizza for only $8.50 including a drink. The Mediterranean pizza looked excellent also very fresh!it is fairly busy even on a weekday over the lunch hour we were there from 11:30 until about 1 enjoying each other's company. The decor is nice, authentic, and clean. I would recommend this location and anything on the menu looked awesome! Give it a try, I dare you! Oh, and the location is convenient just one block west of I-17 on cactus North one block.",

There was a good amount of options to choose from. Large array of items on the menu. The prices are comparable to other sit down restaurants and the food portions were pretty good.  There is a lot of parking available, so no issues there.   The service was okay. A couple of times I had to look around to find our waiter. Our food took awhile so we had to ask when it would be done. This is probably the only negative things about the place. Otherwise the food was good.  Definitely a place I would recommend to others. It could have been an off night for the poor service. I would try the place out again in the future.",

    "text": "Not a good experience!  I ordered their combination appetizer platter.  But then when the food was brought to my table, it wasn't anything remotely resembling what i asked for - instead of various munchables, they brought me an assortment of different pastas!  Being the non-confrontational introvert that i am (and perhaps being a bit over-influenced by a minidoc i had recently seen about wasted food in the U.S. weighing heavily on my mind), i didn't make a fuss and accepted the wrong order but my politeness definitely came at a price since i ended up paying twice as much than what i initially intended to.  I'm sure under different circumstances, i would have enjoyed my meal and the atmosphere but being baited and switched and scammed out of my money left too bitter a taste in my mouth replacing any from the actual food.  An absolutely horrible way to end the weekend!  I'd like to be able to give them the benefit of the doubt that this was an honest mistake by a waitress not paying any attention to her job, but the number of other reviews and comments i'm seeing here about similar experiences or dirty tricks like not honoring their own coupons or deals suggests that this is a scam perpetuated by a very shady place and scumbag owners who've built their business model on conning customers out of every possible dollar they can steal from them.  Visit at your own risk.  Or better yet, try going to the buffet restaurant across the street - at least there you'll get what you intended since you'll put it on the plate yourself and there won't be any nasty surprises when it comes to the bill since you'll pay the same no matter what or how much you eat.",

They have a generous menu with an array of pizza, Italian dinners, hot subs, burgers, salads, drinks and desserts. The Caesar salad and tossed salad were amazing, topped with fresh sliced cheese. I had the Chicken Parmesan and my wife had the combo dinner, both with garlic bread and the plates were piping hot when they came out. Everything was absolutely amazing. Our server Magdalen was right on point with service and smiles. If you are looking for non-chain Italian food, I highly recommend this place.

Waited 15 minutes after being seated for our server to get off the phone to come get our order. Once the bread came, it got us very excited for our meals to come because it was so good. The spaghetti and fettuccini we ordered were completely flavorless with a prominent taste of faucet water. The pizza we could have received a during a peter piper or chuck-e-cheese all you can eat lunch special. It was between this place and Olive Garden and we were very disappointed in our choice since Olive Garden would have been a more enjoyable, cheaper meal. Even the sprite was off and had no taste. Awful is an understatement.",

    "text": "Our car club tried Anzios this week after several members who had visited in the past recommended it for our monthly luncheon. Of the 18 who attended, all agreed that to go to Anzios was a great idea and one we should put on our regular schedule of spots to dine at. Easy to get to and with plenty of parking. Anzios is indeed a popular spot, in addition to our large table of 18, most of the other tables were full. Our group mostly dined on the luncheon specials, which there are many of, and each includes soup or salad and a good sized entree. I, as usual, opted for the pizza. I chose a pepperoni, olives and mushroom, with a house salad. As the menu states, the pizza takes around 20 minutes as they don't just put together a bunch of pre-packaged ingredients, but they take time and use fresh items. The medium pizza was a bit small, but it was quite tasty. The crust was a bit thick...just a bit...the toppings were great and plenty of them. Sometimes when you ask for olives and mushrooms, you can almost count how many they put on, this pizza was done right with ample amounts of toppings and cheese that was obviously fresh. As usual, I take a few slices home as a good pizza will taste as good that evening or for breakfast the next day.  The other diners ALL loved their entrees, I think the group pretty much sampled the whole menu of luncheon items, with super reviews.   Now for quite possibly the best about the dining experience for a large crowd, the service was excellent. Orders were taken and food came out at  a steady pace so that everyone was eating at the same time. Friendly, helpful and there when you needed them was the wait staff. The cooks must have also been working at a great pace as they kept the food tasty and right on time.  All in all, a wonderful afternoon dining experience and we will be back.",

Wish I could remember her name.  I ordered meatball sandwich special and my husband got pizza. We also shared the antipasti salad. Everything was delicious and freshly prepared. Thx!",

    "text": "After finding this place on Groupon (and I am a big Groupon user), I decided to give this a shot. Being from NJ, where the Italian population is quite high and every other restaurant is a pizza or Italian place, I would like to think that my standards for Italian food are higher than average. In the end, the food is slightly above average but I wouldn't exactly call this authentic Italian food. If you go in expecting Americanized Italian food, then it's not bad at all.  I ordered the lobster ravioli while my girlfriend ordered the combination dinner (manicotti, chicken parmigiana, and fettucine alfredo). Portion sizes were definitely on the bigger side, so that was a plus. The lobster in the lobster ravioli wasn't exactly the freshest and who could blame them really? The closest source of lobster isn't for at least a thousand miles. The sauce itself was VERY cheesy and there was so much of it that I had to buy pasta at home to even out the pasta to sauce ratio. I would say my dish was just OK. My girlfriend's dish was better than mine and I actually did enjoy the chicken parmigiana. The fettucine alfredo was pretty standard and the manicotti (like the lobster ravioli) was a bit over-sauced but tasty. I would have liked my pasta more al dente, but that's just my personal preference. Both dishes came with either soup or salad, and garlic or french bread. I do have to admit that the garlic bread was amazing - awesome crustiness on the outside, warm and soft on the inside.  As for the service, the waitress was very sociable, attentive, and nice. No complaints about the service here. It was relatively busy when we went but we were seated immediately. I can't comment about their pizza, but I would try if I'm in the area.",

The food is very reasonably priced & the amount of food you get for the price is exceptional. To make things even better, everything that we ordered was absolutely phenomenal.

    "text": "Service: 3 Star Food: 1 Star Ambiance: 2 Star Price/Value: 3 Star  If you don't think Olive Garden serves up a mean bowl of pasta at a fair price, then move along people!   You don't want to dine here.    Because Anzio's is just okay.  It's a humble neighborhood joint, dated, family-run Italian restaurant.  Inside is clean and decorated like a cross between a Village Inn and a Disney version of an Italian restaurant.    Service was okay.  People were friendly and generally pretty decent at taking orders and checking on patrons, even if getting the bill paid took 20 minutes (which is too long for a weekday lunch!).  But where I was most disappointed in was the food.  While edible and I managed to finish it, it just wasn't good.  We started with an order or fried mushrooms.  Served in the standard plastic dishware with a plastic cup of ranch, they were just so-so.  For $7.50, I expected them to taste better.  Lunch came with side salads.  They were fresh.  It was a small pile of leaves and some fresh cheese and store bought croutons, with dressing in a little disposable plastic cup on the side.  It was okay, nothing special.  For the main lunch course, my wife got the fish.  For $14, she expected something decent.  It was a barely seasoned piece of frozen fish, bones and all.  The veggies were previously frozen vegetable medley, served under-seasoned and overcooked.  My wife loves fish and routinely orders fish entrees at lunch, but could barely eat it.  I had the lunch lasagna special for $10.50.  Small portion tasted just okay, and the salty sauce tasted like it was out of a can.  It was better than Stouffer's, but not by a lot.  So that's the bottom line.  Maybe all of this food is made fresh, by hand, from some recipe handed down from someone's Italian Nonna (Grandmother).  After all, I wasn't in the kitchen watching.  But to my palate, it tasted like it was reheated food bought pre-packaged and often pre-prepared from a restaurant supply place like Costco commercial.  It just wasn't great food, people.  And yet, for the price, it should have been better.",

    "text": "Let's start with appearances. The place sits in strip and is brought down by the neighbors. The inside is set to Italian decor. The tables are spaced nice so you are not sitting with another table. Nice setup inside.  We arrived with nine people for a birthday celebration. We were told no reservations, but they were able to accommodate us upon arrival.  The appetizer ordered was fried zucchini, mushrooms, and onion rings. The color was bit dark like bad fry oil or a bit too long in the frier. When the soups and salads arrived, our table was not cleared. We ate the soup and salad with dirty dishes on the table. No big deal as the plates were small and out of the way for the most part. Once the main dish came, we held our plates up while the food was placed in front of us. At that point the appetizer, soup, and salad dished were removed.   The main dishes were okay. They were not the most flavorful but we're good. I had higher hopes based on the reviews I read. I was a bit let down. I feel there was a bit of seasoning missing. Good but could use a little bit more. I feel there is a lot of potential here.",

The staff were all friendly and the servers were quick to refill water, tea, etc.  I got a combo meal which consisted of Chicken Parmigiana, Lasagna, and Fettuccine Alfredo.  My meal came with Minestrone soup which tasted like the ingredients were fresh.  The Chicken was cooked perfect and the Lasagna was very good.  The Fettuccine Alfredo was OK but not as good as I've had elsewhere.  It came with garlic bread which was I thought was pretty good.   I thought the prices were very reasonable.  I would come back here again.",

Mouthwatering pasta that I can't seem to stop indulging in. Absolutely wonderful. I ordered fettuccine Alfredo with chicken it was rich and creamy. The chicken was grilled to perfection. The staff was pretty busy but not as busy as they normally are and the service wasn't too great. It was slow for the chairs not being completely filled up. It took a good 5 minutes before we even saw a hostess.  My first visit here was phenomenal. Service was on point and wonderful. I hope when I come back it's not as slow as my second visit.",

So good! Also had the wings which were wings - good but nothing over the top; along with the trio appetizer. All in all I'd stick with the ravs. Can't forget the mention the minestrone which they make in house and was full of flavors. For the main dish, I had the baked rigatoni and subbed in vodka sauce (because why not!?) and boy was that a great choice! Friends had the lobster ravioli and there was no shortage on lobster - also another great pick.",

I actually did eat at Anzio's with my cousin from Tempe and her two picky eating sons. I had a shrimp scampi pasta which was quite delicious. I enjoyed fresh garlic toast and my daughter had a small pizza and loved their crust. I don't remember what my cousin and her kids ordered but they were quite pleased.",

All their dishes are pretty good the only one I wouldn't really recommend is the chicken fettuccine... The pasta is good but it's either the sauce or the chicken that gives it this taste that right away reminds me of the chicken noodle soup thru would serve us at school... Other than that it's a great place.",

Its extremely tradition, so if you're looking for fancy or updated, this is not the place to go. It's very traditional italian with a mom and pop vibe to it. The wait staff was great!   Warning, if your going to order garlic bread as an appetizer, it's probably going to come out with your main meal. We'd had pasta and pizza here. Very delicious!!!",

Unfortunately, I wasn't overly impressed. The food was ok but nothing to rave about. Out of the 6 of us we all got something different. No one in my group had anything great to say about the food, the main highlight being that it didn't seem too greasy and the portions were ok. The garlic bread came out cold and our food wasn't brought to the table at the same time. Our waiter was friendly, though I never received a refill on my soda. I had expected a little more from this place based on the reviews. My out of town friend specifically asked for a non-chain Italian restaurant, but she and I both agreed that for the same price, Olive Garden would have been the better option. I think if this place simply added more flavor to their foods as a whole, and had a slightly more attentive staff, they would deserve 4 stars rather than 3.",

However, for this price, there SHOULD be MORE chicken! We are not gluttons, but seriously, chicken is in short supply on this dish. -Lasagna has good flavor, but again, needs more beef in the sauce. Pasta is cheap and adds no value, without the standard meat in a dish. You sliced this corner a bit thin. -Garlic toast is yummy! -An Italian restaurant without a good Caesar salad dressing is a shame! This dressing is just a vinegar/oil combo...find one without so much vinegar!  Even Paul Neuman's creamy caesar is wonderful! Why not Keep it in your kitchen or find a restaurant supply with something similar? -Cinnamon bread, although too greasy, is DELICIOUS, when taken home and baked a while to get rid of grease and to \"finish the cooking process\" -During holidays we bought 5  large pizzas on different days to lunch with our employees...we were all very pleased!  We ordered meat lovers (sans bacon) and they were excellent! We ordered 1 thin crust veggie, but it was soggy and bland. Pizza is waay above the average.",

    "text": "My office is close to this restaurant now and I was craving for GREAT itialian food.  I have not been there for years but I remembered how yummy their food was. The young waitress was very friendly, courteous and I asked her should I get the pizza or one of the other lunch special specials? She did mention receiving a salad with the meal and suggested the pizza is the BEST! The WORST thing the waitress could do was not come back to me with a salad that I thought I was going to receive. One of her customers came in and she had a longgggg conversation and totally forgot me as a customer and still waiting for my salad. Waiting for about 15 minutes.... I stood up and told 2 other employees who were having a break at a table.  They attended to me with the salad and one of them explained that I really wasn't suppose to have had the salad with the pizza.  I explained that the young lady and I were talking about 2 different type of lunches and I thougt she said salad was complimenting both.  I then told the other employee IF the young lady came back to check back on me-IF I needed anything, she could have told me then I wasn't suppose to have received a salad, BUT there was \"no\" checking back on me at all!  I also was waiting for a refill on my drink and told them again I was waiting and I was going to the bathroom.  At this time I was totally disgusted. :(  Then when I walked out of the bathroom, the young lady was talking about how I wasnt suppose to have received the salad.  I interrupted her and said IF she would have only checked back with me, I would have been ok with her level of service. I haven't been back since and not sure IF I ever will. The OTHER employee did comp me as she said she WANTED me to come back and she was sorry. This is a mom and shop restaurant and I am shocked that with ALL the restaurants going out of business that this level of service exists. This wasnt a real recent visit but thought it should be mentioned.",

When I first walked in I was actually a little disappointed that smoking is banned as it would have added to the atmosphere, which is \"generic local Italian place\" but not too gaudy and the dining room might even be called \"cozy\". Kind of like a Mimi's Cafe but less cluttered.  Had the hoagie with Italian minus onions with the shoestring fries. The ingredients were fresh with a surprisingly good sub roll. I'd drop the American cheese though. My coworkers had \"The Don\" (steak hoagie) and a spaghetti plate. Everything looked good if very simple.  I'll offer an an extra star for a local independent that's seems to making a good go of it. If you're in the area and looking for Italian, you could do worse, but I wouldn't drive more than 30 minutes for this.",

Salad, garlic bread and a huge portion of pasta all for around 8 bucks!  What a deal! We ate the lunch portions and it filled us up the rest of the day.   The sauce on the pasta is a little sweet and very delicious. I tried the lasagna, rigatoni and manicotti; all of which were very good. And, normally I find restaurant drinks very boring, but they had very good strawberry lemonade. It's too bad I didn't try the pizza, but now I have an excuse to go back. (Not that I need one!) I don't think you could go wrong with anything you order here.   I wish there was a way to pick up this restaurant and place it in my hometown.

    "text": "Came here tonight hoping to have the great food that I remembered from years ago. My parents used to take me here and it was delicious. What happened?  I got the combination dinner of lasagna, fettuccine alfredo, and chicken parmesean. They pass this platter off for 14.95. The chicken tastes like it is frozen... I couldn't take more than  two bites of it. The tomato sauce is overly sweet and basically flavorless. The fettuccine alfredo.. The sauce was bland... thin enough to not be clinging to the noodles... The lasagna.... The only thing that had any flavor was the ricotta...   Now for the service.  Bad. The server that wasn't even ours basically threw the menu on the table without looking, hitting my fiance in the arm with it then came back with a second menu and plopped that carelessly down next to me.  We're both pretty indecisive,  so it did take us a bit to order. The server was very ingenuine, and it was obvious. Having been in the food service industry for almost 10 years, I know when someone just wishes you weren't there because they want to go home. After our salads were brought out then taken away in haste by the other server, we were brought our meals.... without the server noticing we needed silverware, which we couldn't find our server for. .. we ended up taking some off of another table. (The salad came with a fork on the plate) Our server asked once if we were okay and hurried away quickly almost as soon as she asked. Came back once more where my fiance was finally able to ask for parmesean. The server left our table to hopefully grab it,  but instead went immediately to another table to help them, grabbed take out boxes, went to help another table,  then finally grabbed the parmesean.  I get it. We're not a large party. We don't look like we have a lot of money... buy I tip darn well when I get good service.  Needless to say... I will not be returning... ever.",

Slow, rude and argumentative then blamed it all on being sooo busy with the few tables that she had to serve.  The other servers seemed to be on their game and got customers seated, served and cashed out within a reasonable time frame. Our lunch took an hour and a half for two small pizzas and a salad. At least we didn't get sick like our one of fellow reviewers.  ** I do not recommend this place if your in a hurry, but if your tolerant of a potential bad service experience then the food so far has been pretty good.",

Did a great job for us literally dropping in with a ton of people.  Service was great and the Anzio's team was organized.  Took a while to sort out the bills at the end, but that's understandable.  The room was nice and arranged perfectly for us.  Most importantly got us drinks fast, big thing for me. :)  I used to work in a Italian restaurant when I was going to school, so I know thing or two.  The place:  Nicely laid out, clean restrooms.  Cool Italian motif.  The Food:  I asked everyone) Pretty good overall.  They make their own Ranch dressing-a must.  Marinara and meat sauce was good.  The Don sandwich was the Bomb.  Pizza took a while, but it was Friday night.  We will come back again, but we will give them more than a few hours notice next time.  Great job Anzio's!",

We are happy when we get the same server as she takes great care of us and creates an experience. The other servers are ok but don't do anything to make it a special experience. They have the BEST wings in town. We also love their traditional Italian dishes. We are trying their pizza during our next visit. Parking is a little hard since there is only a limited amount of spaces and it's in a dim lighted area so seems a little sketchy but we've never had a problem.   Try their chicken noodle soup. Add salt and pepper and it's great!  Save room for their Cannoli's and ice cream. It's worth the calories!   Support this great local restaurant and you'll be pleasantly surprised!   Full Disclosure: I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 because sometimes the service is average and if they seat me at that weird table that faces the wall, I will never come in again. LOL. Seriously they need to remove that table or use for water pitchers and iced tea.   Highly recommend giving this place a try!",

From outside it could be anything but inside it was quite nice, well decorated, and fairly quiet.  So atmosphere was impressive.  Next thing was the friendliness of staff.  I asked to see the manager who turned out to be the owner and told him that something wasn't working right on internet since I couldn't see the menu.  He was unaware of the problem and said he would fix it.  Next came the food.  Wife had a pizza which she glowed over.  I had a combination plate of different kinds of dishes.  Was wonderful.  A lot of food. I'm glad I took a chance on Anzio's.  We'll probably return this evening.",

They offer gluten free pasta so I was game. I ordered the Tuscan pasta dish with spinach, artichokes and feta cheese, along the GF noodles. It didn't taste like there was any sauce on it, just the veggies and cheese. I added pepper and salt, but it was still a bit lacking. My friend got their spaghetti with meatballs and an order of garlic bread. I have to say that it was disappointing to me that, like so many other restaurants that offer a GF pasta noodle, they did not go the extra mile to offer a gluten free garlic bread is beyond me. Garlic bread and pasta go together like Forrest and Jenny! Aaand no GF dessert either.  This is why they garner 2 stars and a big Meh from me.",

It was a convenient place that came highly recommended by the Holiday Inn staff down the street. Me and the hubby had  the personal pizzas which was more than filling and the crust was buttery. It takes about 25 min to make them but it states that on the menu and were worth the wait. We got the chicken parm and meatball parm to go and they were very delicious as well. Also great strawberry cheesecake . Great place with great prices.",

    "text": "Such as this is what makes cannoli holy.    It was Saturday evening the the lot was nearly full and as could be seen from the outside, the restaurant and staff were busy.  On entry I was greeted by a \"Please wait to be seated sign\" and the distinct, wonderful smells of Italian cooking, I was promptly seated in a comfortable booth overlooking the south side of the sizable dining room filled with booths and tables and plenty of people who seemed to be enjoying their meals, whether pizza or pasta or both.    I was starved and eagerly anticipating filling, tasty Italian, and the menu hit all the right notes with a multitude of appealing appetizers, pizza and pasta favorites, and nearly equally appealing sounding sandwiches as well as a dessert menu I couldn't quite keep my eyes off of.  I went for the \"Combination\" dinner of lasagna, pasta alfredo, and chicken parmigiana.  With that came a crisp, fresh house salad, and of course buttered garlic bread.  The platter contained 3 generous but not insanely oversized servings, and it both looked and smelled wonderful.    My first thought about the whole meal had been \"There will be leftovers,\" but alas, there were no survivors.  The alfredo and its pool of white cream sauce was situated between the two red tomato sauced lasagna and the chicken parm, and was excellent: flavorful, rich and creamy without being almost nauseatingly over-rich as it is in many places.  The lasagna was a tomatoey, cheesy delight; the chicken parm moist and satisfying, and the garlic bread perfectly warmed, lightly crisped around the edges but not scorched and burnt.    A very satisfying meal and I was plentifully but not painfully full, and couldn't keep my mind off that dessert menu.  There was a delicious looking brownie sundae, cheesecake, and more, but my eye was on the cannoli.  Once I confirmed they were made in-house, it was a confirmed order.  There was a \"mini\" at only $1.99, but none of that for this caloric splurge, I went with the regular at $2.99 - and was not disappointed.  This wonderful touch of sweetness in this ricotta and chocolate morsel flavored crispy fried pastry might have been even better enjoyed with a good cup of coffee, but given what might have appeared anyone around as my own private speed-eating contest, there was not time for that.  It was a perfect, meal-ending delight, such as what makes for the expression \"holy cannoli\".  Apologies that I can't compliment my server by name, but she was personable without being overly chatty, friendly and efficient, attentive without hovering.  Food was served in reasonable amount of time.  All in all, an impressive meal for under $20. Anzio's is a genuine family-run Italian pleasure.  It was my first and only visit, but it won't be my last: too many temptations left untried on that menu. Good food, good quantity, good service and good price in a clean, pleasant, comfortable sit-down restaurant.  Beer & wine available, as well as banquet room facility seating 35-70.",

I was pleasantly surprised when I order a kettle one lemon drop martini & it was made perfectly. The staff could be friendlier since I am their often, maybe they are tired of seen my face & my two kiddos. over all I keep going back because of the food.

I got the lobster ravioli with the minestrone soup, my boyfriend got the combo dinner which included; chicken parmigiana, lasagna & Alfredo with a minestrone soup as well. We also got an appetizer, the combo platter wit; mushrooms, cheese sticks, onion rings & zucchini. Appetizer was standard fried foods. The cheese sticks stood out the most to me because for once I could actually taste REAL cheese inside, not plastic gross cheese you usually taste. The soups were super subpar to me, very salty for me. I would for sure get a salad instead of a soup next time. My lobster ravioli was very very good. Just very very creamy and heavy, which I mean it's lobster ravioli I wouldn't expect it to be any other way. Just not for me. My boyfriend loved all  3 entrees included in his combo plate. I was obsessed with the chicken parmigiana! The food is super good, I feel like I just made the wrong choices  in order to fully satisfy me on my first visit. I plan on going back and trying different things!",

Then after reading the Yelp reviews we decided we would definitely give it a try.   The atmosphere when we walked in was cozy and casual. We were seated immediately which was another bonus.   Our server was Mike...he was awesome and recommended several menu options for us to try.  We started with the coconut, macadamia shrimp, which came out hot and with two delicious sauces.  We then decided on the Chicken Alfredo Pizza.  Again, another great choice.  The crust was just right and the toppings were very flavorful.

    "text": "(Writing this as we are here)  After reading rave reviews about Anzio's, my wife and I decided to give it a try. Trying to find the place with GPS was...well...an adventure. Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted and handed a pager. The other \"regulars\" inside waiting were very warm and hospitable. One gentlemen commented on how they come to Anzio's every Friday night for family dinner. I figured that it must be good.  We were seated in a quiet corner next to a large 60\" flat screen with the playoff games on. The atmosphere was pleasant, not too loud, not too quiet. Normal conversations being had at the different tables. The wait staff was well dressed and professional. We waited a little bit more that 5 minutes to be greeted by the server, but, he did make up for it in his attentiveness and speed of service.   The dinner menu was somewhat overwhelming. So many options, so many different food types. Heck, there was even 1 lb. burgers on there?! I thought this was an Italian restaurant? We started out with some wings, sweet and spicy and medium. Texture was good, seems like they went through the pizza oven and then mixed with the sauces. Not bad, but, I'm not sure that it's worth the price.  For entrees, I decided to go with the classic trio (Chicken Parmesan, Fettucine Alfredo, and Lasagna). My wife had the chicken and broccoli dish. Our meals came out with our choice of soup or salad. I tried the chicken noodle soup which was surprisingly VERY good. My wife's salad was a typical house salad but was generous in portion and was the right starter to the meal.   The food came out PIPING hot! We were warned to let it cool for a moment before we dove it. I don't think I let her finish the sentence before my fork was in the Chicken Parm. The Trio was darn good! The Chicken Parm was the best part of the dish. The Lasagna felt that it lacked something in the sauce. The noodles, cheese, and filling were great, it's just that the sauce was bland. The Fettucine was cooked perfectly and the alfredo was very tasty. I would try that again. It was not too heavy, not too garlicy, just right. Not many place can do that!  The Chicken and Broccoli dish was just what my wife (8 months pregnant) was craving. It came with their signature garlic bread which was cooked to perfection. Perfect amount of garlic butter, cheese and crunch to the baguette. She had \"way too many\" (her words).  My 2 year old son devoured his kid's spaghetti. He ended up licking his fingers after shoving the last forkful in and proclaiming aloud \"dee---rishious\" (his best attempt to say delicious). He was quite upset when it was gone and asked for more.  Overall, we were very pleased with our experience. The server was very attentive and the speed of service was perfect. Only complaints would be waiting more than 5 minutes to be greeted at the table and the taste of the sauce on the lasagna. Everything else was great.  We'll be back soon to try a couple of different options. 4.5/5",

I love their salad that comes with it and the garlic bread... OMG so delicious! If we have room we always get dessert. I'm not giving it a complete five star only because I feel like their dinner prices have gone up quite a bit in the last few years and the serving size isn't much bigger than the lunch special size... so if I do go I try to make sure it's at lunch time; saves me $5 on my spaghetti. Plus the monkey bread dessert is now more ice cream than monkey bread, which is disappointing.   P.S. They must put crack or something in their strawberry lemonade because it is addicting! So good!

    "text": "I really don't want to hurt a small business, and normally I would send a private message to the owners through Yelp, but they do not have that option. I literally would give them 1 star, but again I don't want to hurt a small business so I will compromise (giving 3 stars will hurt less than 1 star in their overall ratings).  We used to eat here often until about 15 years ago. They USED to have an awesome Philly cheese steak!! That was our go-to order! My dad even used to meet up with all of his buddy's on a weekly basis and they ALL ordered the Philly! We stopped going when, like other posters have noted, we had a deal and they refused to honor it despite their excuse for not honoring it being NON-EXISTENT in the fine print!!   Well, we were going to be in the area and we decided to fill our craving for a good Philly!! I think it used to be a prime rib Philly, now it is sirloin. I ordered the \"smaller\" version and my hubby ordered the \"larger\" version. The problem is that his \"larger\" version had very little meat!!! Mine as a \"smaller\" version had just as much meat as the \"whole\" sandwich!! My hubby kept making comments comparing our sandwiches as he ate his \"bread sandwich\". Since he asked for no onions and no mushrooms (and since there was minimal meat), he literally had a bread sandwich!!! To make matters worse, the meat just wasn't the same... AND for $10.00, my hubby's puny sandwich did NOT include a side!! To make matters double worse, my hubby's bread was overcooked and dry!!  So my hubby ate his bread sandwich and I could see the hunger in his eyes despite having finished his sandwich... so I gave him half of mine!! I really didn't mind, because I didn't think it was very good!!! I called my dad and told him not to feel like he is missing out not being in the area and not being able to enjoy as he used to do for so many years. It is a good memory, and that is ALL!!! We won't be back!!  NOTE to owner:  Having gone there for so many years so faithfully, along with many family members and friends, we stopped going when you refused to honor a deal/coupon. That was the last time we went for about 15 years. I notice another poster was recently very upset about their deal not being honored despite no fine print as a warning. You do often offer deals. You NEED TO HONOR THEM!!! It will cost you a LOT MORE when you REFUSE to honor them because, like us, people will not return!!! You lost years and years of our business over a few bucks by not honoring a deal YOU OFFERED!! NOT a smart business move!! With that said, someone needs to be accountable for making sure that the meals are served in a way that will make this business PROUD!!!  You are lucky that I'm not posting pictures!!! We are so very disappointed!!!",

Our server was Shelley, and when she learned we were first timers,  she was very helpful,  answering questions and offering info. We tried the Combination Appetizer and loved it. Zucchini, Mushrooms,  Onion rings and Cheese sticks.  Yummy! Our entrees came piping hot, served with hot garlic bread,  crusty and good. I enjoyed the Ravioli and Hubby loved the Chicken Parmesan.  Our server,  Shelley,  surprised us at the end with a wonderful Ice cream plate with Welcome written on it. We will surely recommend this place to our friends and will return again.",

The parking lot out front saves you the headache of searching for parking. The waitress was great. Very consistent, quick, polite, & funny. The toasted ravioli was delicious. But my main dish, the 3 in 1 meal was off the chain. But the most unbelievable part of it all was the entire meal was under $30. Which is always a plus on vacation lol. The portions were so much I ended up wit a nice doggie bag to take back to the hotel for a late night snack. This little Italian spot definitely gets my seal of approval as a must visit.",

So we called a couple other Olive Garden location and got the same thing, 2-3 hour wait for a party of our size. Someone suggested Anzios and we called to find out the wait time and to our surprise they said no wait time we get you seated right away. So we headed over and sure enough they didnt blink an eye at our big party and seated us right away. They were very busy too.  The wait staff was super and the food was great. I will be going here again and again. Everyone left satisfied. I hope Olive Garden goes out of business.",

Loved all the choices on the menu too, I ordered the lasagna and the spicy meatballs. I have to say the meatballs stole my heart, so moist and just enough spiciness. Our waitress was wonderful, she even brought out a beautiful dessert on the house since it was our first time there.We were so surprised, can't wait to go back!  Thank you Anzios!!!",

    "text": "Drove a long way to get to Anzios because of all the great Yelp reviews.  Was there in time for the luncheon special. It included a salad and a choice of garlic or french bread.  As my entree I chose spaghetti and meatballs (which turned out to be one meatball).  The salad was iceberg lettuce with shredded carrots & mozzarella.  Not a stellar salad but it was included in the special and the garlicky salad dressing made it taste quite good.  French bread was toasted and quite fresh.  The sauce of my spaghetti & meatball (yes 1) was too sweet and had too much oregano for my taste and so I had the meatball and left the pasta almost in its entirety.  My companion had a sandwich of breaded chicken breast and eggplant with marinara sauce which came with the most amazing french fries --homemade french fries just like my grandma used to make.  I thought that was a lost art in restaurants.  Everything is frozen nowadays but clearly not here.  BTW most of their salad dressings are also homemade.  So he totally enjoyed his sandwich and fries until his plate was clean.  The server, Brianna, was wonderful.  She celebrated my first time at Anzios with a complimentary dish of ice cream.  Really, really sweet--Brianna, not the ice-cream!",

On this ToGo, I ordered one of my regulars:     Tonight's  3 pieces Cod Fish very fresh however batter very tough , the fries, garlic bread and tartar sauce all excellent.  Chicken Soup always tastes like Mix just add water and boil.   The treat of the night were the Cannoli\"s.  I think they made the shells in-house or they are using a high quality shell.  Meal 2.5, Service/To Go Careful Packaging 4.5 +Cannoli 5 = 4 Overall Rating.  If the batter on the fish was tender and the soup was changed they would have an easy 5.",

The caesar salad was average, but all the other food I sampled from the people I was dining with was excellent. I still need to try their pizza though, which I hear is good but can not confirm that firsthand.  One caveat was that the service was pretty bad. The waitress did not seem to care at all and it seems like the type of place that is impossible to get a refill at. I might try ordering a 'to go' order next time, because the food was amazing but the service really needs major improvement from what I saw.   Aside from the service it was mostly a pleasant place to eat at, which was surprisingly because when we arrived it didn't appear to be that way from the outside. In any case I would mostly recommend Anzio's for their great Italian food!",

I think it was just the kind of pizza we got, the spicy BBQ. It was pretty much just spice, no BBQ. It was quite greasy and bland. It was just chicken, cheese, and \"BBQ sauce\". It could really use onions for flavor as I've had on other BBQ chicken pizzas.   I still give them 3 stars review because our boneless wings were exceptional and seriously I think just this pizza was bad. Maybe next time I'll try the sausage pizza, I remember that being really good when I was a kid. Stay away from the spicy BBQ pizza! Blek!",

Our friend tried the chicken noodle soup and loved it. I ordered the lasagna and it was probably the best I have ever had. They said they make their sauce there from scratch and it makes every dish. The salads come out on a cold plate with a cold fork to make it fresh and their house italian was excellent.  We were going to try a few things off the desert menu and the owner came out and we started talking.  In addition to sweet cannolis and tiramasu, we got to try a new item coming on the menu soon. We will be back for sure!!  One last thing we commented on with the other couple we went with was that while it was busy (most tables occupied), we were able to sit and have a pleasant conversation without the noise usually associated with a busy restaurant.  So 5 stars on the atmosphere too! If you are driving down 17 make the stop, it is worth the trip.  Prices very reasonable and food the best.",

As was the additional wait-staff that assisted in keeping our drinks filled and ensuring our meal was on spot! 3. Menu was more than anticipated.  Arriving at the location, we thought it was just pizza, however, they have an extensive seafood, pasta, as well as pizza menu. This is a restaurant that we will add to our list of favorites.  As a side note - checked the Maricopa County Restaurant inspection - this restaurant has pretty much had a grade A since 2012.",

We have figured out that we can just get a small, the onion rings and 12 wings and we are stuffed.

We were all surprised how large of a potion the sandwich was and the amount of fries he got as a side. They definetly ddn't skimp on it.  We come at least once a month.  We weren't sure what to expect the first time we went since it looks like it is just a hole in the wall place, but I am finding those are some of the best places.",

Fabulous way to start the dinner.  Had a lot of other options for the kids to drink besides pop.  Breadsticks were homemade and delicious.  Pizza was wonderful.  Our server was attentive, but not overly.  I have already recommended this place to two other people.  I look forward to going back and trying other items on their menu.  At the end, since we were first timers there, we were presented with a free large dessert that we could all share.  Nice way to welcome guests.",

    "text": "Whenever I come back to the Phoenix area for a visit, Anzio's is always my first stop. Friends and family (shout out to Bryan B. !!!) know that if they want to see me within the first 6 hours of a visit, they should just head straight there and a order up a mess of pizza and wings.  The Pizza: I have never ever had a pizza like this. As mentioned before, they put something in the crust to give it a sweet sort of tang that is addictive. The pies are always cooked perfectly, never soggy and never overly greasy. (It's pizza, so there's gonna be *some *grease) And it's so good the next day straight out of the fridge.  The Wings: Again the keyword here is consistency. They are the same every time. Cooked up perfectly, just the right amount of sauce and some of the best ranch for dipping you can find. I wouldn't mind it if they offered something a little spicier than the \"hot\", but that's never kept me from erecting a massive bone sculpture in honor of my tiny vanquished foes. Also delicious the next day either straight from the fridge or reheated. (if you take some home, don't forget a side of ranch, the store bought stuff just doesn't do them justice!)  The Filler: I love the wings and pizza here so much that I've always looked at the rest of the menu as being just filler. But every once in a while I'll sample someone else's goods to see what I'm missing out on. The salads are always simple but tasty, especially with the ranch dressing. They also have a steak sammich called ' The Don' that has officially made it into my Anzio's rotation. It's a steak sammie with peppers and onions and cheese (provolone?). They serve it with your choice of a creamy or marinara sauce. Do yourself a favor and get it creamy and you'll never look back.  I've been coming here as long as I can remember and it's always been good. The service is always good, whether it's with a smile or a scowl.    It's been 5 days since my last visit and I'm already starting to get the shakes and dreaming of my next visit...",

Robert who was our server didn't which started off only bringing half of the tables drinks and then took the tables order. The problem with that is half of them were in the restroom. After ordering for everyone including the ones away from the table from the server with an attitude, we asked if we could get the rest of everyone's drinks. After returning with the drinks, one of them which was a water with lemon that he forgot the lemon, we never saw him again until the food came out. Never checked on us, never asked how anything was didn't get the order correct, and had a bad attitude. But he didn't have to worry about the tip since it was include with larger parties. Just wasn't a good experience for a birthday dinner.",
