Didn't know what to expect for counter service breakfast. The place is cute and you walk by the chef cooking. Once I totaled my bill I thought, this mom and pop place better be good. We had our coffees and walked out front. Small but cute and near the street. We let the kiddo run amuck. I went to the restroom to wash my hands and found a back patio that was enclosed and well decorated. So we took a bench out there when breakfast came I was flavor blasted. I had a blue corn biscuit thing with eggs and yummy salsa. The other was more of a sweet bread and marscapone egg dish. I ate 90% of both entrees. The kid ran around and didn't bother anyone! It was Perfect! Chef killed it. We will def be back.",

When my omelet arrived it looked like art. The presentation was beautiful and the taste matched the beauty.  What I enjoyed the most about the omelet was the taste of fresh, clean food.  You can tell the food is made with quality ingredients and care.   I'm not a morning person, but I would get up early on a daily basis just to come here. I will definitely add it to my regular stops and ensure any non-local visitors get to experience this place. Oh, and of course highly recommend to locals.",

    "text": "OK, so we found this place last year and ate there twice.  Its in a quaint neighborhood near downtown on the corner of 12th st. and Oak between Mcdowell and Thomas.  Both times I had the House Hash that I thought was really good.  3rd visit today, I met my match. \"Breakfast Lavosh\" I proclaim \"Best Breakfast in Phoenix\" It took the bias I had for my other favorite breakfast at Essence Bakery On Indian School and 38th st which is the \"Big Breakfast\" that I substitute sausage for the Crispy Bacon. Excellent Potato Cake, sauteed mushrooms and thin multi grain toast with home made jelly!  The edge here for me with the Breakfast Lavosh is the complexity of the combined flavors of the sausage, bacon, Canadian bacon, mushrooms, peppers and scallions and of course eggs.  My wife had to tell me to calm down because I could not stop telling her how blown away I was with the breakfast as I was eating it.  This is one breakfast for me that will be hard to beat. I have found a new best friend when I want a really good breakfast!  The restaurant is small.  Think it used to he a house.  Holds maybe 25 inside but has a small front porch with seating and a larger back patio if you want to eat outside.  I have not abandoned Essence Bakery but have found a Must Have breakfast in the Lavosh!   Douza's Kitchen is a must try Breakfast Restaurant and they are also open for Lunch although I have not tried the lunch menu yet.",

I had the chef's breakfast special, which consisted of BBQ pork ribs, eggs and hash browns. The hah browns were a pleasant surprise as they were more flavorful than other breakfast places. My portion size to price ratio was fine at $14, but my wife's was $11 for a small bowl.  The menu is varied and interesting. The food was good. The staff was friendly, but the waitress offered a refill on water and coffee and then had to be reminded about it.   Overall a good experience and worthy of a repeat.",

Being nice by rating it one star for their greet as we walked into the place, following up by saying \" help yourself's to sit anywhere you want and we will be right there to take your order.\" With the weather being so nice for Phoenix, Arizona we chose to sit outside. We sat for 15 mins with no service and two water cups. As the waitress in the red diamondbacks shirt walked up and down walk way, still no help ( just like the D-backs season, a fail). No menus, no service, after 15 mins time to go. As we were walking out the door, I asked a different waitress how do you get service here. Do we come to you guys to place a in-house order. She replied \" what can we get you both.\" Love trying new restaurants and sending my clients to experience food spots in Arizona (that's what I do for a living). Saddens me how the service was, making me not even want to try the food now. Definitely don't want my guest's experiencing that either, it's what it's onto the next.",

    "text": "We came here first thing in the morning after a long night before flying into Phoenix.  Needless to say, we were in the need for a good meal and some comfort.  We used Yelp to look up breakfast and this was one of the places that came up.  It seemed to be a neighborhood spot and the neighborhood looked cute so we thought what the heck.  It was one of the best decisions we made  It is a mildly small cafe with an open kitchen just behind the order area.  The bakery display case has fantastic looking pastries and the like in them, if they were closer to the door I would never leave and just keep eating.  We ordered the arepas, shepards biscuit, one of their flavored waters (cantaloupe, honey and mint), coffee and a few pastries.  The arepas had just amazing flavor.  I think they were blue corn meal but the chorizo, sausage, scrambled eggs (if I didn't have a health issue, overeasy would have been better) with a side of their potatoes was so good.  Like a heuvos rancheros but way better.  The shepards biscuit was great too.  A fluffy biscuit, sausage, bacon, brisket with ricotta and eggs was just meaty, yummy comfort.  While their pastries were decent two, the breakfast was the star.  It totally made our day after a long night.  The chef and staff also treated our daughter like a princess and just placed smiles all over her face.  Thank you!  We will be back any time we are in the Phoenix area",

In fact, I don't even look at the menu any more, and haven't since my second visit.  Instead I order whatever the daily special is, and yes, I'm bummed if I get there late and they have run out.  (That has only happened once, and the dish I ordered in place of the special was every bit as good.)  Check out Emil R.'s review for a bullet-pointed list of the wonderful things about Duza's.  The only thing I would add, which I realize is a personal thing, is that I never add salt to whatever dish I am eating.  I trust this chef so completely that I would not dream of altering any of his dishes, and I have never said this about any other chef or restaurant, so make of that what you will.  If he serves a dish with eggs sunny-side up, then that is how I eat them, no questions asked, even though I'm usually a scrambled egg guy.  Okay, you've been told by me and other capable reviewers how really good this place is, so get your butt in gear and go ASAP!",

    "text": "The only word I can think of for this place is 'bizarre.'  Let me start with the good: nice location, nice menu, good prices, good service, cool bathroom.  Now on to the strange: the first thing I noticed was a service cart that had a cleaning bucket filled with liquid, some dirty rags, a busing tub, and cleaning spray chilling right by the door and right next to a couple who were eating. Not only is that just gross, it's also a health code violation. I've worked in restaurants, and that kind of stuff is a) never supposed to be near customers/out in the open, and b) never supposed to be near food.   Then there's the kitchen set up. Everything is set up in a line and out in the open. The cook line is right next to the dishwasher and the place where dirty and clean dishes are set up, which are literally right next to the cash register. It's great if you want to know who's making your dish, and I think on some level it creates some kind of accountability; but it also means that the restaurant is loud 100% of the time. The dishwasher's going, dishes are clanking, cooks are yelling, etc. Weird vibe.  Also weird: the fact that the cooks, the dishwasher, and the servers couldn't tell what dishes were clean or dirty. We were sitting inside, and as we waited 45 minutes for our lunch (maybe due to the dish debacle?), I watched one woman take out dirty dishes from a dishwasher tray, then a waitress went up to her and asked if the dishes were clean or dirty--the woman didn't know, so the waitress got frustrated and told her to pay attention. The dishes went into the dishwasher after it was deemed they were dirty. Then the dishwasher left out a crate of dirty dishes, a cook came and asked if they were clean or dirty because he needed a pan, no one knew, so he took one anyway. The dishwasher came back and said they were dirty, and put them in the dishwasher. Then, she left out a carton of clean dishes, and other people started stacking dirty dishes on top of them because they didn't know. If she was new, it was a rough first day; but someone should have been keeping tabs on that. By the time we got our food, it was lukewarm and just okay.  Based on the reviews, we were really expecting a great experience, but Duza's just didn't deliver.",

On the menu it states that the french toast has : blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, mango and mascarpone cheese.  So it was a no brainer and we ordered 2!  Yet we got ours with only blackberries and blueberries.  When we called over our (rude) waitress, she took it as an attack.  When I asked for some Tobasco she told me it was already on my table.  When I asked my wife if it was on the table the waitress said (loudly), \"What???  You don't believe me?\"  If anybody is reading this from Duzas, I was in on Valentine's Day around 11am and the waitress was wearing a red top with little tore up shorts that showed more than enough skin to be inappropriate.  Sorry...won't be back!  Cozy place but rude service!",

The waiter was helpful and prompt.  I ordered the savory crepe,  and a dirty chai latte, both were fabulous and I had nothing to be critical of. My SO ordered the pumpkin quinoa porridge and was unimpressed.   I think this place is perfect for someone who prefers fresh ingredients with pretty plating, but it misses the mark with someone who prioritizes quantity or economy. We won't be coming back, but I'll remember that crepe with fondness.",

If you want to pretend like you live in a small town where everybody knows your name, have breakfast on Duza's patio. Walking up to this place, I feel like Lorelai visiting Luke's Diner ... and I've been one time.  The omelets are perfect for those wanting a healthy brunch. Sometimes, I order a \"table pancake\" at other breakfast spots. It's literally a pancake I make everyone at the table share so that I can indulge, but in a sensible way. Of course, we all still get our own breakfasts, so it's not too sensible. Actually, it's more like, let's all be fat together. Yay, carbs! But when I don't want to do that, this is the spot. The omelet is delicious enough on it's own. Not that you can't indulge here, because you most certainly can. Crispy breakfast naan bread anyone?",

All around a cute and tasty addition to the Coronado area! Check it out!",

Their menu is really cool and different the savory crepe was great but I wish they served two of them in the plate and not one its just too small of a portion as a meal, the nann with egg dish was great very tasty and portion was ok not too small or too big and the water infused with fruit is a nice healthy touch that we loved. Overall I would say it's a great interesting place for a quick bite if your not starving with fair pricing.  I would have loved to see the waiter and menu with bigger portion vibe or restaurant feel instead of the order at the cashier and wait for your food at a table kind of vibe but other then that this place is great and the menu is fantastic just didn't leave feeling fool...",

You see where I'm going. Anyway, we arrived around 11, which is usually when they stop serving breakfast, but they were serving it all day for black Friday I guess.... we ordered at the counter - he got the shepherd's biscuit and I got the breakfast pita concoction. We sat down and all of the sudden the restaurant was flooded with people, good timing on our part. We had coffee while we waited, which was fairly tasty. The food came out and the plates were huge! My pita looked so fresh and delicious. Who knew that pita, hummus, feta, over medium eggs, arugula, and prosciutto made the perfect breakfast? This thing was so good, it had a freshness from the arugula and a richness from the feta and prosciutto. The pita was warm and fluffy. I haven't had a combo this tasty in a long time. The husband's was a little less exciting, but still good. It was essential a pile of meats on a biscuit (brisket, bacon, spicy sausage, and maybe something else?). I think he was hoping for a gravy of some sort. Regardless, he seemed to like it as his plate was completely clean at the end of the meal. All of this only cost about 20$. We'll be back!  PS- If this place put pancakes on the menu, it'd be an easier sell for my husband, just sayin...",

Whenever I see a place has grits that's automatically what I order. That being said, they were definitely disappointing. The grits tasted like they had thyme or some other kind of spice that turned me off to this dish and my eggs were over cooked. I also ordered the biscuit with sausage and brisket, but that too was not very good. Maybe because I just had some awesome brisket at Bobby Q's the night before, but this brisket was sub par by far. The pro's: the biscuit was delicious, it tasted fresh and was soft and buttery. The side of toast we ordered was also delicious. The bacon on the sand which was thick and cooked perfectly. It's an adorable little spot with a great patio and a small off street parking lot. The staff was very friendly and even offered us a free fruit infused water.",

I suggest their French Toast or their Pumpkin Quinoa Porridge. I enjoyed the portion size and the family atmosphere. I'd suggest just going with the water as the restaurant is tiny and it is extremely hot. Their coffee is just okay, but the water has a hint of fruit in it, which was simply refreshing.",

Great atmosphere and food is AMAZING, but not a place for a quick meal whatsoever. Our 15 minute wait to order turned into 35 minutes...and we still hadn't ordered! Once ordering, we waited an additional 20 minutes for our food.  Great if you have a few hours to kill, but overall service is bad. Friendly staff but slow and obviously overwhelmed.",

We will however sit inside on pour next visit,  the flies were a little bit of a problem in the back area. Didn't take anything away from the food or a very attentive waitstaff they were great... it's just getting to be summer in the city",

    "text": "I don't usually vent on Yelp, but how long should I have to wait to place my order AND THEN how long should I have to wait for my food....AND would it kill somebody to get me a cup of ANYTHING to drink when you tell me I have to wait 20 minutes to order and them make it more than 35?  If you come here prepare to fetch your own water, or find someplace else when these folks are full.  Last time here the food was great, without the wait, but few place's food can offset sitting on a wood picnic table hoping to order so you can wait again. Very disappointing. Very embarrassing when you bring guests.   Finally got food ordered. $50 for 4 people and can't promise how long the preparation will take. Turned out to be another 30 minutes for most and a few more for the 4th plate...and silverware for all.   I'd love to give credit to the server aiding the table behind me for bringing drinks and taking their order at the table, but it unfortunately adds to the frustration for customers not accorded those courtesies.   PS.  If the slice of Oreo cheese cake that got set on our table as a waitress flew by  was a token of an apology, it might have helped to say something. We were waiting to find out is was a mis-delivery so we left it in place.",

Lots of oven roasted tomatoes and mushrooms, fresh spinach and a creamy cheese binder.   Hubby had a turkey sandwich which was fantastic. It comes with a side of kettle chips. The ciabatta bread was especially nice.   The next day, my brother flew into town and was starving after his flight. I dont think I've ever returned to a restaurant two days in a row before!   We both ordered sandwiches and a side salad. It was a delicious Caesar, whole leaves of romaine with chunks of parm and a really good dressing.   I like the open concept kitchen and am super impressed with the size of the kitchen area vs the size of menu/quality of food they consistently provide.  I haven't tried any if their pastries from the case but their Chai drinks are great. I stopped drinking coffee so I love having a spot to get a good iced Chai  (:",

We grabbed a table outdoors and commenced to catching up.  Just to set your expectations, make sure you get on the list to order as soon as you arrive, especially on the weekends.  They only have 9 burners so it works best this way.  Once we got the routine figured out, things went quickly.  We all had coffee and I ordered this yummy concoction of beans, eggs, brussel sprouts, and lemon.  My friends had an omelette, pumpkin quinoa, and a yummy jelly roll-type thing.  The service was great and we spent a lovely 3 hours catching up.  The prices are very fair and the menu is really innovative.  HELP small places like this become successful by allowing them to work thru their challenges !!!  Duza's is on to a good thing and I wish you well ....be sure to \"remain awesome\"",

The food was impressive.  The assorted French toast was made with banana bread and others.  Incredibly decadent and filling.  My husband enjoyed the shepherd's biscuit, but after seeing the meat lover's dream special of the day, was wishing his selection had been a bit more filling.  We did try a Jesuit roll from their pastry case, and it was divine!  It was a great find, and we will return when in the Phoenix area again.",

The service from the cardigan guy was really good. He was chill and made suggestions for the polenta, which was what I ordered. The food is truly exquisite with high quality ingredients and the presentation is simple but elegant. Sorry, no pics cuz we were both hungry. Even the water was lovely, infused with lavender.  Now comes the BAD part. The cardigan guy sorta left and CONSTANCE came over and she was a major angry bitch. Full of nasty, angry attitude, and acted like I was demanding when I asked for a spoon. When the bill came, I told her to charge the polenta dish on the green credit card (mine). My friend ordered 3 things- salad, orange juice, and ice americano. Well, the bill came back and I was charged for my friend's Americano and I called out to her but she pretended she didn't hear me so I ran after her and told her there's mistake. She asked all angry, \"Are you sure?!\" That's not a good sign to doubt your customer. I told her clearly, \"I told you to charge the polenta on the green credit card, NOT polenta and americano.\" No apologies, no \"Oh, that's a mistake. Let's fix that.\" Nothing. She snatched my cc and walked away with it silently. That upset me and I asked if she's going to charge me again. She just said, \"It'll be refunded.\" And charged me for the right amount. I was fucking pissed off by the whole ghetto experience.  I walked out to my friend and we were about to leave. Then CONSTANCE runs over being all bitchy and extra demanding my friend pay for the Americano. She literally fucked up and acts like we were trying to steal. Yeah, no. That heifer has no chill. Angry and unapologetically rude.  If you want great food, come here, but absolutely AVOID Constance. She's wanting to fuck up your day, too.",

    "text": "Wow! If you're looking for a unique breakfast, I'd highly recommend checking out Duza's Kitchen! It was my fiance's birthday breakfast choice & without a doubt, he made the right call to go here.  We arrived around 9:30a on Saturday & were able to snag one of the two remaining tables. The restaurant is very quaint, not too much seating inside (additional seating outside), but they seemed to have an organized set up. Guests can add their name to a list and order at the counter when called for a table. It definitely seemed to save time since we received our food soon after we were seated, and we didn't have to worry about paying the bill after we were finished eating.  I had ordered an omelette with prosciutto, burrata cheese, roasted vegetables, & portobello mushrooms and a side of potatoes. My fiance ordered the arepas with a side of potatoes. I liked how the omelette option was completely build-your-own style with multiple options of meats, veggies, & cheeses. They filled the omelette with a generous portion of all four and the combination I had chosen was really tasty. I enjoyed how creamy the burrata cheese was which was balanced out by the crisp veggies & fluffy eggs! The arepas were also very tasty. There were multiple components & the best bite I got was with a little bit of everything together. While the potatoes were cooked well & tasty, that side dish would probably be the only item we'd skip out on next time. The breakfast items were large enough that we didn't really need them & they were a bit overpriced.  Overall, we really liked the atmosphere of this breakfast spot & the food was very unique and flavorful. We will definitely make the drive to Central Phoenix again to eat here!",

    "text": "Disclaimer: This is my first time here and I am visiting from NY. I discovered this place thru Yelp and decided to check it out since it has good reviews.  It's a relatively small BYOB restaurant, more like a diner. The place was busy (Sunday AM) and moderately noisy. There is an outside patio area great for groups and sunny days.  The staff is nice and helpful. But I was NOT too happy for having to wait more than 30min for my food when I came here alone!  They softened the blow by giving me a 10% discount on my order. I ordered the Shepard's biscuit, which was good and original but also felt quite greasy.   This place is good for an innovative American style breakfast, but not for healthy food or vegetarians( a few items on the menu are).",

Ordered a latte and it came out lukewarm.  Plus I'm so confused with the way you order here. You give your name at the cashier and then wait to order and get your seat after. Probably makes sense when it's really busy but when it isn't it's just confusing. And the employees didn't help explain it much to us, who were obviously confused. It's a beautiful and fun space, I'm just a not excited about the new tenant.",

That makes sense so, when we went last week, we came in from the back and stood in line at the counter. The hostess told us the line is toward the door but a man was standing in front of the door and a couple was sitting on the bench probably waiting for a table. There was no room in that area so we stood in front of an empty table, next to the door. Then she asked us for a name and if we wanted in or out. I was a bit confuse. Are we putting our name in to wait line and then wait to get a table? She was annoyed and said the sign is in front of the door. Shouldn't this place be \"order first then find seats\"? If you are going to take names, then seat them and, when they are ready, they can order at the counter. This way you clear the entrance area. We like the food but it's not worth the hassle.",

Everything from the ambiance, friendly staff and food were spot on! Oh, and the coffee - so good! Best cup I've had in a long time! I had the breakfast special which was fried chicken with country gravy served on slice of asiago bread, homemade hash brown style potatoes and topped with 2 eggs. Delish! I will be back!",

The chef who doubles as her husband/owner was very sweet and very good with my little girl.  He held her a little bit and then offered to make her some pumpkin puree!!  Which she loved!  Afterwards, we asked them what pastry they suggested and they gave us a Bosnia version of an apple pie and it was amazing.  We went to pay for it and they said it was on the Chef!! I loved the energy that they had here, it was all so positive and warm!  It's in a house turned restaurant and I hope that they become a fixture in the neighborhood.  I would eat here all day everyday if I could!",

I love that the chef is pretty much just in the open...not hidden in the back somewhere...so you can watch him building his creations! I shared the Mexican breakfast torte with my fiancee -- it was one of the larger items, enough to share. It even kept us full all the way to Sedona and on our short hike! It was flavorful and had the perfect balance of spice. This brunch food is not overdone -- it seems to be classics done with the right twist, without going overboard. I hope everyone gives this place a fair shot!  Oh and I loved their latte. The coffee definitely was strong enough to get me going at 6am on a Saturday, without being so bitter that I needed sugar...I need to find out where they get their coffee beans from.  I will definitely be heading back! There is so much more on the menu I need to try. And don't forget about their pastries too!!! And check out the cool art they have -- currently it's by an artist who works with acrylic + epoxy.",

Unfortunately I was in and out quickly and just picked up an iced latte and OJ to aid in my morning buzz, but I cannot WAIT to come back and eat here, and of course update my review based on their delicious eats. I would also totally come back to this cozy spot to work someday. My latte was delicious and their fresh squeezed OJ was also a winner. I asked the chef what a cool looking yellow/purple fruit was on their counter and he cut it right open so that I could taste it! It ended up being a rare melon and was so delicious. Talk about 5-star service!! You can definitely feel the passion when walking through the doors of this great local business. See you soon, Duza's!",

Each dish was very unique and flavorful without over saturated in butter or salt. Everything tasted fresh.  We sat out in the patio which was very nicely shaded and cozy.  They also serve vegetable/fruit infused water, which was very refreshing.  Tried some pastries (bear claw, pecan bread, and cookie) and they were delicious as well.

First off the location is in the same building as the former Astor House, not much has change decor wise, except it's a little more of a rustic French take versus urban mid-century like the Astor House. Everybody from the cook to the cashier greeted us as we walked in and we grabbed a menu. It's a paper menu for now as they are rolling with this for about a month to see how the customers feel about their menu. I had The Hash which is essentially a meat bowl (prime rib, sausage, ham, etc) sauteed with an assortment of veggies with two sunny side eggs on top. The meat was seasoned perfectly and not over salted (my pet peeve) and very tender. My husband had the Shepherd's pie (I think that's what it was called, Shepherd's something) and his was delicious as well! His consisted of bacon, prime rib, sausage, avocado and a Gruyere kind of cheese on a flaky biscuit, so good! They have different pastries, coffee options as well as fruit infused water and juices. The entire menu sounded delicious so it was hard to pick something! I was very impressed considering it was the grand opening and will be back for more.",

My fiance & sister had omelettes too & loved them. 2 people had the French toast with berries & marscopone cheese. 2 had the Hash & Eggs. Everyone was happy!

The arepas were very flavorful, served with 2 different delicious salsas, guacamole, and pico de gallo. Everything was very fresh. Sooooo good I might have eaten a little too much. It's a hearty dish. The coffee here is a robust, local coffee: Bonus. My cappuccino was a little small but perfect. As soon as my water glass was empty, one of the waiters filled it. All waiters were very friendly and attentive, and the bathroom was spotless. Nice. Such a really enjoyable brunch. :)",

While I've tried at least half of the menu and everything is tasty my favorites are definitely the savory crepe, crab shrimp Benedict and the assorted French toast. The savory crepe has an amazing taste and is lighter, the crab is fantastic and the French toast is really unique, fluffy and stacked three high. I sometimes get the crepe then French toast as a dessert :)  Great chef, nice BYOB Friday night special menu (follow their FB page or sign up with your email), and very reasonably priced - there's no reason not to go here all the time!",

Although I only stopped in for an iced chai and a bacon quiche on my way to the airport.   The iced chai had good flavor at first but the milk/syrup reduction wasn't cold so the ice melted quickly and watered down the flavor. Sad face.   The bacon quiche was delicious. I appreciate greatly the complexity that different herbs can bring to a dish. It wasn't a typical egg dish with some salt, pepper and paprika - I enjoyed having flavors like rosemary in there.   Service was friendly although we didn't interact much, the owner handed me my to go container, it was very wonderfully plated even in a to go box. I had a picture but must not have saved it!  I will be back to sit down and try a full breakfast, I have high high hopes for that.   Definitely go if you are in the area. I love living in the Coronado district, many sweet hidden treats.",

We shared the Cold Plate (smoked salmon, smoked trout, cheese lavosh, cream cheese, capers- lox and bagel esque minus all the bagel carbs) and the French toast. The French toast was made with three types of bread- maple, pumpkin, and banana nut- and topped with raspberries, strawberries, mango.... So needless to say no syrup or topping was necessary. Both of these were incredible. The French toast was a creation of the owners (which are a husband and wife pair) and it did not disappoint.  I had the Crispy potato, asparagus, beans and Brussels sprout bowl, it comes with two eggs your way and is a great healthy option (which the menu is loaded with other nutritious and veggie loaded options). My boyfriend had the shepherds biscuit and he loved it. The menu has somethings to satisfy all!",

Typically, you would go to the counter and order and the servers will bring you your order. But because we had the twins and a larger party, they actually came and took our order for us! Great customer service! The food was amazing! I ordered the Parmesan toast with prosciutto and asparagus and it was so flavorful and delicious.

After reading yelp reviews, we decided to give Duza's a shot! As everything on the menu sounded so delicious, we decided to each order something and then split it all 4 ways... OH EMM GEEEEE... Was that a good decision! The Mexican Breakfast Torte was most of our favorites - so yummy and spicy. Arepas were a close second! After enjoying a really nice meal in the cute little misted yard, sipping our super tasty iced coffee  (excellent coffee is served here!), we kept eyeing the neighboring table's Assorted French Toast and just HAD to order it. Best. Decision. Ever. What a great excuse for dessert at breakfast. We even had a surprise encounter with the owner of the restaurant. She was so down to earth and fun to talk with! Can't wait to to return and try additional items off the taste bud tantalizing menus",

    "text": "Going out of my way to write a quick review of this amazing little spot that popped up in the middle of my neighborhood (Coronado Historic District). I've seen a couple of places come and go in this location and want this one to stay! The atmosphere is quaint (hasn't really changed since Astor House occupied the location) and it has an amazing back outdoor space which will be great with the nicer weather. The first time my husband and I went was for breakfast and the staff was very friendly. My husband had the Arepas and I had the Shepherd's Biscuit, both of which were delicious and the coffee was great also. We had our 9 week old baby with us out on the back patio and felt totally comfortable. We ordered take out for lunch for four people and not a single thing disappointed. The sandwiches are served open-faced and use creative, fresh, organic ingredients. The Farm Quinoa salad was especially delicious and the prices are extremely reasonable. Love that you can get a (great!) salad in a mason jar for $4.50. There's a juice bar I'd like to try as well as baked goods. From reading my neighbors' takes on their experiences as well on our neighborhood message board, it's obvious Chef Duzic cares about the community and is willing to take feedback into account. This is a great addition to the area and being just a few blocks away, we plan to frequent it often!",

    "text": "I went here this morning with high hopes. After \"discovering\" this place on yelp, it looked like a place I would love.. Unique breakfast dishes and close to home. The reviews were very favorable, so I gave it a try. It is a cute spot. You order at the counter and they will bring the food out to you when it is ready. I arrived early (Pre-7am) so it was not busy at all. I ordered the House Hash with eggs sunnyside up. The food arrived quickly. Like other posters mentioned, the hash was underseasoned. It had nice big chunks of meat, potatoes, peppers, etc, but it was just lacking in flavor. I rarely add extra salt or pepper in a restaurant, figuring the chef knows best, but I had to grab the shakers to give this dish some flavor. Another thing I found strange is that it is a breakfast dish (eggs, meat, etc) and it isn't served with any kind of bread or toast. I would expect a slice or two of a nice, freshly baked bread to accompany a breakfast dish like this.   And lastly, (and this is just a quirk of mine), as stated, you order at the counter and pay when you place the order. They ask you to sign your credit receipt (on the flipped around cash register tablet) and inquire about a tip before you even get your food or any real service.  I tip based upon the food and service, so how can I know how much I should leave. I gladly leave 25% or more if everything is great.. But I will also tip a much smaller amount if things are substandard.   Bottom line, I will come back again, but I will try a different dish that hopefully is seasoned adequately.",

The server came out many times with a single plate and a drink and didn't even look over at us. She seemed completely inexperienced and lost. It was almost closing time and we finally asked about our food and it turned out they forgot to print the ticket. They said \"sorry\" and refunded our money but there was no sense of urgency or ownership. No one came over to our table to apologize in a professional way. It feels like a place with just a bunch of employees but no manager to make you feel comfortable or smile at you when you walk in.  Super odd staff! The food is good though.",

Will definitely be revisiting for a healthy, filling, affordable lunch break away from the city grind.",

    "text": "Hidden gem in Coronado.  Don't be fooled by the fact that it's counter service in a yet-to-be-fully-gentrified neighborhood.  This is a small place with a big heart, attentive staff, huge value, and the most creatively conceived and beautifully prepared comfort food.    I would never have guessed in a thousand years that I would moan over quinoa porridge but this stuff is incredible - quinoa, sweet potato puree, flaxseed, agave syrup, candied pecans and a heavenly mix of baking spices and ginger.  Warms your soul from the inside out.  Hiding behind the deceptively simple name, \"Cold Plate\" is an artfully presented tapestry of cold smoked fish, heirloom tomatoes, capers, eggs, and other goodies all waiting to be placed on a light and crispy cheese lavosh.    Ever since the closing of \"My Arepas\" in Chandler, I've been on the lookout for a good Arepa. Chef Duzic's version does not disappoint.  A beautiful, thick, maize dough patty is topped with Chorizo, queso, quac, fresh green salsa, and creme fraiche.  The whole thing is nestled by giant beans and topped with - what else? - a perfectly fried egg.    All this plus a beautiful patio, serve-yourself Passport coffee, a take-away case with delicious pastries and house-made jams, and the Cardinals game playing on the house speakers on game day.  Congratulations, Duzic family!  Duza's is our new go-to Sunday brunch hangout.",

If you can't find something on this menu that you'll like, there's something wrong with you. It runs the gamut from vegan to paleo. I chose the latter...and I'll do it again, and again. Arepas are probably one of the best breakfast ideas I've seen in a long time. (Huevos rancheros, chilaquiles run in the same crowd.) My wife's Parmesan toast with asparagus looked every bit as tempting. People are friendly, seating options abound (inside-outside) and there is a overall good feeling when you walk in. GO there.",

Cons: - Drinks and Pastries are not on the menu that is given at the table but instead is hanging above the register. - If you do not eat pork for whatever reason this isn't the place to be, they rely heavily on the pork flavors to boost their dishes.  - If you substitute the pork for turkey, like I did, I received a snide remark (from another staff member who hadn't been waiting on us) about how I'm taking the best part off the plate. (This was suppose to be taken jokingly, but I felt like I was to be ashamed that I don't eat pork products.)  - My subsitute for the pork products (which were Jalapeno chedder sausage and bacon) was turkey and it was very very bland and was a huge disappointment and kind of haphazardly thrown on the plate.  Additional P.O.V:  My boyfriend enjoyed his dish (he eats pork) and said it was very flavorful and was cooked excellently. He ordered the Breakfast Naan.",

There are plenty of places that serve bacon and eggs, but there are very few places offering a creative, well thought out menu with unique, interesting dishes.  Everything on Duza's menu is made with quality ingredients, and is just a step above the norm.  Thick cut, grilled asiago cheese toast instead of plain white toast.  Sliced fresh fingerling potatoes, seasoned and sauteed, instead of traditional home fries.  And specials for breakfast - something you don't see at your local diner.  Prices are excellent, and the staff is friendly.  We can't wait to go back.",

It looked like a quaint little house which has been converted into a quaint little cafe. But once you sat down, you begin to notice the artwork on the  wall (done by local artists and is on constant rotation every few months or so, so we were told by the super professional and courteous host/server). Then the menu. Oh the food choices on the menu. We got these: 1)Shepherd's Biscuit piled high with meats and eggs 2)Pumpkin quinoa porridge with almond milk 3) House hash 4) Smoked salmon and trout with radishes, capers, red onions, spinach with a balsamic vinegar dressing, and tomatoes, along with a cheese lavosh (which looked like a thin cracker)--loved the deconstructed presentation of my other  food love, which is the same stuff but served on a toasted everything bagel!  4) for drinks--brewed green iced tea, coffee (delish!) and served with cream, and brown sugar or with Stevia  5) a chocolate croissant--just because.   Set us back around $50.00, but basically we did order food worthy of four people    In the end, I managed to take but three tablespoonfuls of my porridge--yeah, after finishing off my fish platter, I was done for. I was super full!   Final verdict--will return ASAP! The Japanese-like simple elegance of the food plating is impressive. By the way, the chef is Bosnian, and he knows good good and from the looks of it, art as well. They've been around for two years only. I want them to last for as long as possible. Duza's is that good.",

I initially had a little trouble finding the restaurant when driving over, there are no significant signs from the street as it's in a residential area. It's a small quaint place, I was instructed to order first and there was open seating, I sat outside while waiting for my food. Be forward, the flies are very aggressive, ugh! Lol  The service was good and my food came out within a timely manner.  I ordered the Mexican Breakfast Torte, it was between that and the french toast and glad I took the cashiers advice, b/c it was amazing! The flavors and spices blend very very well together, along with the salsa provided on the side. I don't usually take breakfast leftovers home with me, but I didn't want to leave a morsel of food behind, lol.  I will definitely be back to Duza's, it's hidden gem.",

I've only been in for breakfast, but I'd certainly like to come back for lunch and try a few more of their items. Everything is prepared from scratch and you feel right at home, which is great if you're just looking to have a nice breakfast or lunch with someone. I had the Shepherd's Biscuit, which is a biscuit with melted white cheddar, brisket, pork sausage, topped with avocado and a creamy ricotta, paired with two eggs any style. The sausage had a nice kick to it, just a hint of spice, and the biscuits were almost toasted for a nice crust on the bottom. They also do coffee and espresso drinks, and have some freshly baked pastries available if you're on the go. I will certainly be back.",

You can cover yours with creme fraiche, but I could not. My friend had the special - chicken fried steak and creamy gravy - oh my yum. Our hot teas were refilled, the service was excellent, and when they brought out our piece of chocolate cake I thought I had died and gone straight to Godiva Heaven. Rich and fudgy with chips throughout. Wow. I can't wait to go back, and believe me... I will and I'll bring my friends too!!",

    "text": "I had some friends in town from CA, so we decided to try a new place to eat for brunch.  Since we had plans in the early afternoon, I made sure to budget extra time in case we needed to wait to be seated or if it was really busy.  Good news/bad news is that there was absolutely no wait time and there was hardly anyone inside eating.  Why is that bad news you ask?  I usually get a little nervous when a restaurant isn't packed since it typically means the food isn't anything to write home about.  I ordered a basic breakfast that consisted of eggs, breakfast potatoes and bacon.  If you like your bacon crispy, you'll need to ask for that when you order it since it did not come out that way.  The potatoes were ok.  There were cut fairly small and had some very small onions mixed in.  My friends decided to try a couple of the eggs benedict dishes...the one with crab cakes and the one with pork belly.  I found it interesting that the meats came on the side, not that there is anything wrong with that.  The pork belly was delicious!  Sometimes pork belly can be too chewy depending on how it's cooked.  This was not the case.  There isn't anything wrong with this place, but I was a little disappointed by our experience considered how high it was rated by other Yelpers.  I may or may not come back to try this one again, but since there are so many other places I haven't been yet, it will be a while before my next visit.",

I ordered the \"build your own omelette\" thinking it shouldn't be too pricy but still pretty filling. I found out you can only choose 3 items to go in your omelette. Anything else is $1.50. That's a bit much for a vegetable.         I ordered the prosciutto, tomato and mushroom with cheese. That meant I was charged an extra $1.50. When it came out it was pretty good size, however, it does not come with any sides. Most places give you hash browns at least. I asked for some salsa from the waitress and they brought me the tiniest portion of salsa I have ever seen. I was pretty shocked by how small it was. The omelette was good, but not good enough to justify the price. After I got my check I was still hungry so I ordered a side of sausage. You get 2 somewhat small sausages for $3. They were extremely good but you should get 3 for that price.          The people were nice, the place was kinda cute and the food was good, but the total for an omelette and 2 sausages was over $19. That's WAY too expensive! Unfortunately I won't be coming back.",

The chef really knows what he is doing because the flavors were out of this world. I got the pork belly eggs benedict. Beautiful presentation & delicious. The thing that surprised me was the fact that it was so good without being overly salty.   My husband got the hash plate which also tends to typically be overly salty & this wasnt! Really great food.

    "text": "If you want a REAL Central/South American meal in Phoenix, this is your spot. By the way, it is 3 miles from the airport so easy access whether you're getting in or are on your way out of Phoenix! It is located in the Coronado Historic District which has some cute, colorful (adobe?) homes. Actually a lot of businesses here, this one included, look like homes as you drive by. It's a very cute and quaint area, away from the hustle bustle.  Firstly, let me just say - what a cute entrance. Blue exterior with an orange door. This place had my heart before we even walked in. When you enter, the place has a very homelike feel. We got a table right across from the chef working and we really enjoyed the smells and sounds and watching him work!   For drinks, I got a drip coffee and my friend got an almond milk cappuccino. Both were excellent and I scarfed down my coffee in a minute or so. The lady waiting on us was so sweet and refilled my coffee several times and gave my friend free refills, too!    Deciding what to order was HARD. There were so many excellent options. I was craving an arepa so that's what I ordered. They had it with beef and chorizo, neither of which Im a fan of, and they were nice enough to sub in really, really great chicken instead. The arepa was AMAZING - it was open-faced with the meat, giant beans, salsa, and vegetable on top of it and was made of thick, blue corn. I think the giant beans get a special mention - Ive never seen them before, but man oh man, were they flavorful and zesty and made to perfection. I loved the tomatillo and red salsas that came with it as well.  They had a lot of great looking desserts and baked goods that we didn't have room to order, especially since this was a pre-hike meal. However, I am definitely coming back here (and already excited about it) when I'm in town next!!",

We were hungry and decided to to try Duza's which was only a short 10 min. drive  from the airport. Upon entering the vibe was chill and relaxed as we were greeted by the staff. We decided to sit outside in the airy patio area (highly recommended). Our waitress was attentive and promptly handed us menus, refreshing lemon/ basil water and coffee (coffee here is delicious!). Both our dishes were AMAZING and the French toast is a MUST try. After our meal my wife mentioned that it was probably the best breakfast she's ever had. Our visit to Duza's was fantastic and if you're ever in the area and want some delicious home cooking, this is your place! We were very fortunate to have decided to eat here. Thank you and we'll definitely return next time we're in the area.",

Duza's is a great place to do just that. I wanted something hearty, and so my server recommended the breakfast lavosh (or lavash, as I see it spelled more often). It was delicious--a thin, unleavened bread topped with eggs, peppers, mushrooms, Canadian bacon, sausage and more. Fantastic flavors, portions that were spot on, plated attractively. Exactly what I wanted before I set out on the road.  There is both indoor and outdoor seating. I prefer indoor seating, but when I arrived, there were no two-tops available, so I had to start outdoors. But...they remembered my preference and shortly thereafter, asked me if I wanted to move inside. I surely did, and that attention to detail is unusual and commendable.I look forward to returning next year for my post-conference relaxed brunch.",

Very good coffee, beautiful food/plating, great food (at unexpectedly low $$ for this kind of place), decent service (although you have to order at the counter), and clean decor.  They have really cool outside sitting but it was pretty cold outside (for my taste) so we sat inside.  It fills up quickly so you'll want to either come in early or have a trendy old blonde woman stare at you to the point where you'll want to leave asap so she can take your table.  I had the eggs with asparagus, giant beans, and potatoes. Friends had various dishes with meat, all raved about them. Before I left I saw and got (and couldn't resist) Italian savory crackers/pretzel thingies, a salted caramel cupcake and a cannoli to go.  Would definitely return.",

My wife has brought me back take-out from there a couple of times and all the breakfast and lunch items have been consistently good.  I visited for the first time this past weekend and the place was hopping! There are pre-made croissant sandwiches in the cabinet for only $3.50 and the beet salad served in a jar is well worth a try.   A couple of opportunities -   1. Checkout girl was not the friendliest. Seemed like she might have been having a bad day and was trying her best to make sure everyone knew it.  2. No wifi. There is even a sign that says \"no wifi - talk to each other\". I think that's a bit condescending to be honest. What if I came there on my own? You probably don't want me talking to myself in your restaurant, may not send the right message! I get that you probably don't want the Starbucks-Hipsters camping out at your tables for hours sipping on a bottomless cup of coffee, but other people might really appreciate the wifi. For example, my wife holds a breakfast meeting every Wednesday and brought her team here last week, but needed wifi to be productive, so they will go back to their other place now.  As it is only a short walk away from my house I'm sure we will be back many times to work our way through the menu.",

This place is a hidden gem and will stay that way until Guy Fieri finds it. The people are super friendly. The food is super good. Not up for House Hash? Hit the Butternut Ravioli, the Crepe or settle in for some French Toast. Don't expect normal.

    "text": "What a fantastic little find!!  We came here Saturday for brunch based on all the amazing Yelp reviews, and we were blown away by our experience!  Food: totally on point. We had the Arepas (comes with chorizo, sausage, beans, guacamole and a lemon crema on an amazing blue corn arepa), and the polenta (mushroom polenta on a bed of greens with eggs of your style choosing), and everything was fantastic!    Service: also on point! We were constantly checked in on by the hostess, waiter, chef, line cooks.....it was a well-oiled machine!  The only downfall, which I won't mark a star off for, is we found out that they will be closing this location at the end of this coming weekend (so I believe the 18th is the last open day). They are moving to Payson, so a loss for Phoenix, but I guess I now have a great place to dine at when we go out there.  If you have a chance to get there before they close, please do!!!  Places like this are a dime a dozen, and we wish them the best in the their new location!!",

I am sensitive to eggs, and I asked if I could use tofu as a substitution. The chef was incredibly willing, and made no fuss. This meant a lot to me, as I could enjoy my meal completely and not feel bad for asking for an accommodation. I noticed that the chef takes his time to ask everyone how their meal was, and it's clear that he genuinely cares for feedback.   The atmosphere is lovely, and more high class for a small hidden diner. I am a sucker for a tasteful decoration, and this place has it! Make sure to check out how cute the bathroom is too. :-)  Lastly, the thoughtfulness to plate decorating really caught my boyfriend and I. When food is presented in a creative manner, it's indicative of the care for food as what the establishment tries to represent.   We came back the next day for brunch bc this was so good!  All in all, this place is a total HIT! I would highly recommend. :-)",

Our entrees were beautifully presented, my eggs were fluffy and the garnishing was not an after thought.

Our server was terrific (even offered to give me a coffee for the road at the end of our meal) and one of the kitchen guys asked us about our meal on the way out. He genuinely wanted to know if we liked the food. This is a good segue to that topic..  My two teenagers were with me and they ordered a savory crepe and the french toast. Both were outstanding. The french toast was made from banana bread, had marscapone cheese and fresh berries. I ate a very simple hot oatmeal with nuts and fruit. Hard to screw that up. It was good.  This was a very good breakfast meal. I highly recommend it!",

It's local, it's right in the coronado neighborhood, the vibe is great, the restaurant itself is cute, and ofcourse the food is amazing. I love their menu - none of the greasy, usual menu items you would find in other popular breakfast places in the area. My favorite is the house hash. I am a big onion fan which may be a factor in why I love this dish so much - it has scallions, red onions, and shallots in it. The ham, smoked brisket, and roast beef mesh so well together. It is seasoned so perfectly. As far as prices go, most of the dishes are above $10 which isn't bad for how good the food is.",

Every single dish on the menu, is a bit of trying to do too much: once in a while just keep it simple to achieve a good flavor balance.  Food: A bit pricey for the portion size and the meats tend to be overcooked: only the bacon was spot on. Nice variety on the menu, especially if you go with the make your own omelet.  Service: Good, but refills slow.  Overall: Parking may be an issue during busy weekend times, but we got lucky.

    "text": "Looking for a quick breakfast before stopping at the Heard and Phoenix Art Museums nearby, I landed at this homey yet contemporary spot in the historic Coronado neighborhood smack dab in the middle of Phoenix. It really does feel like a residential area with wide roads and a heavy mid-century vibe, so as I was driving on North 12th Street, I was hard pressed to think I would come across a fully functioning restaurant. Sure enough, I missed it twice before realizing that Duza's was in what looked to be a converted, brick-laden home.  It was cute inside with baked goods in a display case (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2u8jtqJ&s=dd46610af31674d52236aaf4afff7d8ef60ad7e9f7519fd5bb0b68ece678920e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2u8jtqJ</a>) and just a handful of tables, one of which luckily freed up just for me. I liked their slogan: \"Great food is not fast, and fast food is not great. Judge after you eat, not while you wait.\" It seemed to be an implicit message to Yelpers who prematurely ejaculate their reviews before finishing their meals. Both breakfast and lunch sides of the menu looked thoroughly appetizing with the Farm Stand Quinoa Salad and Ratatouille (both $5.99) sounding like healthy temptations reasonably priced.  I decided to splurge a bit and ordered the $10.99 Vegetarian Breakfast Bowl, which really wasn't a bowl but a full breakfast plate with a couple of poached eggs, a thick slice of gluten-free toast, grilled tofu, and a hash made of butternut squash, crimini mushrooms, and chopped asparagus (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2pr2xWT&s=7e4e01a0834ef9e9b81ca541c8eba76665de7bc9f1745d920444ff5c08018d75\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2pr2xWT</a>). The yolks were just runny enough to satisfy and the bread was both crisply textured and impossibly soft, but the hash was the True high point with nice umami flavor. In fact, I barely missed the corned beef. Oh, who am I kidding?  FOOD - 4 stars...as good a vegetarian hash as you can get AMBIANCE - 4 stars...compact but homey and comfy SERVICE - 4 stars...very attentive, especially with the coffee refills TOTAL - 4 stars...keep healthy by coming here for their tasty dishes",

We asked the server about the situation thinking that an AC unit was down, but she said it was always like that. The portion sizes are on the small side for the price you pay, as has been noted by other reviewers.",

On this day, I had salmon with the farm stand quinoa salad in a sweet Thai chili sauce. My husband had the beet salad with the pan seared tuna. My favorite part of the  quinoa salad was the Thai chili sauce. It really enhanced the flavor of the salmon and everything else in the salad. My favorite part about the beet salad with the pan seared tuna was the incredible taste of the tuna. I have never had tuna that was so perfectly spiced! The next day, we returned for lunch and I had the Shepherds biscuit, which was lovely, and my husband had the vegetarian breakfast bowl, which  was also delicious! The next time we come here , I look forward to trying The pumpkin quinoa porridge! I highly recommend this place!!",

    "text": "This is a great breakfast place in the Coronado - have been there three times now.  Each meal has been wonderful with the exception of the eggs.  If you have a breakfast/brunch place you would expect the chef could properly cook an egg.  If you order over easy you get sunny side up (this has happened three times) and once the white of the egg was still clear and raw - just couldn't eat it.  My daughter ordered poached eggs thinking that couldn't get screwed up, but she got one egg that looked like it had been fried, it was flat and the yolk fully cooked, the other on her plate was only slightly less cooked - these definitely were not poached.  Maybe we'll try scrambled and see how that goes. That said, the menu is creative and it seems to change a little at each visit.  The food is plated very attractively and the ingredients are fresh.  Prices are pretty reasonable for a nice breakfast that is not your run of the mill stuff.  There is outdoor seating which I love, but as stated in the other reviews the flies are a real problem.  Don't know what you can do about that though.  Service can be a little slow sometimes, but it is prepared to order and is worth the wait.",

    "text": "This restaurant is tucked in a historic neighborhood in Phoenix. Very modern design with art on the walls, concrete, open kitchen concept.  The food was delicious!  Ordered: the omelet with Boursin, prosciutto, tomatoes, and spinach. With crispy bacon (applewood) on the side  Also the crispy Naan Bread with prosciutto, sunny side up egg, arugula, pico, hummus.  Out of the two meals I would order the omelet again, the naan bread was a unique blend of breakfast and lunch, however still tasty. The cappuccino was great and they made it with almond milk for me which was an added bonus.  I would highly recommend for breakfast.",

So much love and attention goes into the preparation of every single dish, and you can see it and taste it.  I love their Ceaser salad. So simple and so good, make sure to opt for that when ordering a meal. The French toast is perfect.   Just try everything!!",

    "text": "Duza's Kitchen it's considered by many as a hidden gem around the downtown Phoenix area.  Our experience overall was good but not great or excellent. The food was great! Good portions but in my opinion nothing \"special\" or to \"die for\". However, it is at least worth to try once.   What killed our experience was the waiting time. We were told that there was a 20-25 minute wait once we got to the restaurant and we were okay with that. What we didn't know was that we were going to be standing for the 25minutes when there were clearly lots of tables open.   My suggestion is to let customers know there's going to be a wait, but if you have tables open, at least let them sit and order drinks... that way customers don't feel like they actually had to wait for 25 minutes. In my opinion this is a problem that Duza's could fix with a bit more organization, they definitely have the staff to pull it off.  I wouldn't mind going back again, but I would probably call ahead of time to know there won't be too long of a wait.",

I ordered the arepas on the recommendation of our server and wasn't disappointed.  The coffee was good as well and the self-serve aspect was nice.   So while not great,  it's certainly very good and very local.   I recommend visiting if you're in the area.",

So, we returned the next day & had a couple of ciabatta sandwiches - one with kettle chips & one with the romaine wedge salad. Again, the food was delicious, artfully presented & reasonably-priced.

We walked in with high expectations after browsing though Yelp looking for the best place to have breakfast... the place certainly did not disappoint.   This place is in what looked to be a residential neighborhood, you are asked to take a paper menu at the door, grab a seat and come back to the counter to place your order when you are ready. The cashier was very nice and patient while we placed a custom order for our littlest one, you are handed your drinks on the spot and given a number to place at your table so that the sever can bring your food to your table.   I expected for our order to take quite a bit of time as there was a sign at the door asking guests to be patient; however, our food was brought to us after a brief 15-ish minute wait which we enjoyed as we sipped on a cup of coffee and enjoyed the serene atmosphere in their back patio seating.   All of our dishes were delicious, the food looked to be very high in quality and fresh, the presentation was just superb.   Quick tip: Tip! I noticed a few people in front of us did not tip when paying at the counter, maybe because they are ordering at the counter themselves; however, the food is brought to you, the server cleans up after you, and the entire staff (servers, cooks, etc) look to work very hard to make your experience a great one.",

The mushroom, spinach and onion were fresh. The side of potatoes were seasoned just right. There was a yummy side of guacamole. My friend had the cold plate and said it was one of the best she ever had. It included both smoke salmon and smoke trout. Kind of like a lox plate.  I still have to get use to the order at the counter service that is becoming popular these days. The food was served to us by very nice and efficient staff.  Also, when Duza is closed for the holiday seasons and summer, it would help to put the date on their website and voicemail message because you have no way of knowing why they are closed for two or three weeks at a time.",

I have had enjoyed a couple of things from their menu, which is a fairly large departure from a standard breakfast place:   the Brussels sprout/beans/asparagus/egg how you like it bowl, the smoked salmon (they were testing it- may not be on the menu), a French toast confection (with banana bread) that oozed with fresh berries, and their stinking good infused water (I get what's in the pitchers off to the side). The bowl has been the most interesting so far because the giant beans have more flavor than I ever would have guessed. Best thing in all of this is that the menu reads like the food is heavy, but it's never felt like I ate too much/ate too much unhealthy food.   And the story of the chef is just cool. He used to be a chef at Phoenix Children's Hospital (I'm not sure if he still oversees it now) and I'm a sucker for people who work for children.   The service was shaky at first (we went in the first couple weeks it was open) but the staff is always warm, friendly and attentive.   So in a nutshell, if you're looking for a good place to catch an early breakfast without feeling greasy, come here!",

It looks like a small coffee shop from the outside but offers plenty of seats inside, and a patio both in the front and in the back.  The hostess was very friendly and made some excellent suggestions.  We ordered assorted french toast with mascarpone cheese, house hash, a savory crepe, a couple of muffins, and yogurt with fresh berries.  We sat on the patio out back and listened to live acoustic guitar and enjoyed the weather.  Very nice place to relax and enjoy the cool weather.    We shared all of our dishes and all of them were amazing.  The best was the savory crepe.  Seriously delicious.  Mushroom cream sauce covered crepe, filled with mushrooms, arugula, artichokes, and roasted bell peppers.  So savory and so so good.  The house hash was also excellent.  Fingerling potatoes, smoked sausage, smoked brisket, prime beef, with peppers, onions and eggs.  I really enjoyed it.    Now I'm more of a savory/spicy fan but the french toast was really good for a sweet dish.  The bread was banana nut and some other really good pieces and it was covered in a fruit sauce and covered with cheese and fresh fruit.  If you like french toast I am sure this is right up your alley.  The muffins were good and the yogurt and berries were fresh.  Duzas is serving wonderfully delicious, fresh and savory food at a reasonable price and with a warm smile.  I all about all of that and can't wait to go back and try a few other items on the menu.  For a town lacking in excellent breakfast options Duzas fills a large void and fills it extremely well.  Highly recommend you add this to your bookmarks now.",

This is a cool place with an even cooler menu. The waiter explained the entrees enthusiastically, leaving us with the difficult task of choosing from so many intriguing options. Between 9 of us we tried 8 different items, all of which earned rave reviews for taste, freshness, creativity and presentation. The chef came out to visit with us and seemed genuinely appreciative of our over-the-top praise.  Looking forward to our next visit to Phoenix and Duza's Kitchen!!!",

This looked like a different and funky place down in the Coronado District which is central located to us.  There was a bit of a wait but it was a beautiful day and they finally sat us in the front at the picnic table while we waited to order.  The chef sent out some pureed squash for #lexidanger and she ate that bowl with gusto!  NOM, NOM - she gave it a thumbs up . The son and hubby had the Shepherd's Bisquit and they said it was terrific with a very smoky brisket and sausage.  The daughter-in-law and I had the Assorted French Toasts.  This was three slices of French toast made with banana and chia breads, lots of eggs and fresh berries and syrup. Absolutely amazing and the chef came out to talk to us about her French toast creation.  #lexidanger lived the berries and we thanked the cook for the squash too!",

    "text": "I don't like the service at Duza's! The food was good, the presentation was unnecessarily over the top. The wait staff argued about sending things back to be corrected. For example, we ordered the Shepherd Biscuit and the biscuit came with cheese-which the waitress tried to say was written on the menu. It wasn't. The menu details read: Buttery flaky house-made biscuit, applewood smoked brisket, avocado, italian (wasn't capitalized), sausage, creamy ricotta (a teaspoons worth), and the sum total of the avocado garnish amounted to an eight of the top of a butter-knife. The tacky way you had to stand at the counter to order and then pay before the food arrives, plus, include a 15% tip before the food arrives, really makes this place a joke. The flies didn't help either.",

I just moved to the Coronado Neighborhood, and I was so happy to find that this place across the street has Arepas on their menu. It doesn't have anything to do with what an Arepa taste or looks like. It is not even a variation. I was hoping to invite a lot of my Venezuelan Friends to enjoy the Arepas from the menu, but it won't make sense. I still like the place, the food and coffee, but don't go if you want to have Arepas.",

The space is nice and open and there is plenty of outdoor seating, it's even dog-friendly which we loved! There are plenty of vegan/vegetarian options as well as dishes for omnivores. Every dish was beautifully presented and the food tasted even better than it looked! It was slightly pricey, but about what I would expect for fresh, handmade food. I ordered the tofu scramble which was amazing, it came with an egg, but if you are vegan I highly suggest ordering this and just asking them to hold the egg. It is still plenty of food to keep you satisfied. My mom ordered the French toast and a Chai Latte with almond milk, she said it was one of the best breakfast meals she's ever had and didn't even feel guilty about the calories. Another friend ordered an omelette which she couldn't say enough good things about. Also, they have complimentary fruit-infused water on the counter which was super refreshing. The service was great and the staff was super friendly. All in all this was a great experience and I definitely plan on returning during my visit to try some of their bakery items!",

Good tomatoes, which could have benefited from salt, on what seemed like store-bought naan with well-cooked eggs. It didn't need the hummus but the hummus was good.  Service was welcoming but it took a long time to get our food. Just come with a book, enjoy the atmosphere, and don't be in a rush.",

Just past the roundabout you'll reach a small parking in the back and more parking across the street.   We came in through the back door. The way to work this is order your food and pay first. There are tables inside, 3 outside in the front and plenty in the back. Water jug with cups are near the cashier.   For one cook, I think, the food took longer than usual but for the now part it was worth the wait.   Breakfast: savory crepe. Delicious creamy. Filled with cooked veggies like arugula, portobello, artichokes in a creamy mushroom sauce. $7.50   Lunch: The sandwich is made your way. You choose the meat, cheese, sauce, and any extras. Chose: Short rib, smoked gruyere cheese on an open faced one slice bread, with romaine lettuce, a side of red pepper sauce. Presentation on this was simple as well as the overall sandwich itself. $9.   Server: a put together server who offered to move the umbrella to block the sun. Thanks! Surprise dessert and a candle lit up twice by the same server.   Would come back again to try the other dishes.",

We flew in from San Fran at the butt crack of morning and got to Phoenix at about 10am. after calling abut 4 places that were highly rated on Yelp and getting no answer, I tried calling here - WAHOO --open, open, open. We headed out from the rental car lot. This place is about 1.4 miles from the airport and it was busy but not crowded when we arrived. Parking was super easy, neighborhood is not the greatest, but not scary.   You order at the counter and then sit at a table, they bring your food out. We got the savory crepe which my mad LOVED, lots of sun dried tomatoes of yellow and red variety, with mushrooms and goat cheese. He thought he would prefer my order, but he loved this and kept it.  I ordered a biscuit with brisket, sausage, bacon, cheese and eggs. FREAKING delish!!!.    I want to give a a big shout out to the really tasty green iced tea  They were training a new server, he wasn't the faster but 't he was trying, so no worries....I was so happy to have a yummy meal in my belly before the long drive to Tucson.",

    "text": "There is a new breakfast hot spot in town - you better get in now before people start lining up! We came at 9a and you know around these parts, you expect a wait at this time on a Sunday morning. Not at Duza's!  The restaurant inside was pretty small and cozy- I am sure the maximum occupancy for eating is 25 or something like that. We found many tables for two so we snagged the biggest one. There is a patio that can seat more people so don't worry - Duza can seat you! Just dress accordingly.   Anyway, hubby ordered the Mexican Breakfast Torte and I ordered the omelet with goat cheese, prosciutto, roasted vegetable (bell peppers), and mushrooms. My drink of choice was the hot white chocolate mocha and hubby ordered the Vanilla Latte. I liked the drink, but not the biggest fan. Unfortunately, they have one size (a small size) for drinks, which is a bummer. My man loves his coffee and his coffee drink was pretty sad looking. I told him he can order another one if he wants but they are $4.50 a drink, a little on the high side...  Let's get to the food...  I thought the ingredients I picked for my omelet was gonna make my omelet oh-so-good and sadly, it was just ok. The goat cheese tasted off - and they put big chunks in the egg that the goat cheese overpowered the flavor of the other ingredients. I also tried the Mexican Breakfast Torte and that was pretty good. I ate more of that plate than the omelet. Total of the bill = less than $30.   What was great is that it took about 30 minutes overall from the time we ordered to when we were done eating to leave. We did not have time to sit and chat - we had errands to do so this would be a good place to order, eat, and be out.   While we were walking out, I saw someone with the Berry French Toast - that thing looked amazing! I will back for that....",

    "text": "Me likey!  It would seem that the Coronado neighborhood's wildly popular Tuck Shop has finally landed a neighbor with staying power.  On the southeast corner of 12th Street and Oak (about a mile north of Banner University Hospital), I found this little breakfast gem on Yelp after waking up waaaaay too early on a Saturday morning.  To my delight, this place opens bright and early at 6am on Saturdays.  As I write this, they've only been open for about two months, but first impressions give me plenty of reasons to smile (as well as make future stops here).  If you're coming here, I'd strongly recommend biking if you can.  You can use a Grid Bike Share bike to get here as there's a Grid Bike station around the corner, or you can park your own bike here.  If you're driving here, I'd park around the corner in the open lot across from Tuck Shop on Oak Street (note: park in the lot with 90 degree parking, not the one with 45 degree parking).   The setup is not too dissimilar from that of Vovomeena (which ironically enough is Tuck Shop's sister restaurant).  A small space where you order at the counter and seat yourself.  The front seating area only has room for about 20 (including a pair of counter seats).  I didn't walk towards the back, but I do believe there's seating in the patio out back.  I just sat up front this go around.    The menu here is pretty quintessential breakfast and brunch fare, but the presentation is surprisingly elegant and the ingredient mixes are pleasantly complex.  And as with many popular CenPho and Downtown establishments, the ingredients are sourced locally.  I was in dire need of a protein boost for my morning breakfast and one menu item caught my attention.  The Shepherd's Biscuit.  A house made biscuit with applewood smoked bacon, Italian sausage, smoked brisket (yes, brisket), avocado, ricotta, and eggs your way.  Yet seeing some of the photos of the breakfast portions on Yelp, I was a little worried I would leave still hungry.  So I got a side of sausage links as well.  Total cost for the food and glass of water came to about $11.  Came out to my table in just over 5 minutes.  For starters, forget everything I said about small portions.  One look at my meal will settle that question.  Aside from being pleasantly surprised by the portion, there was the presentation.  Instead of a biscuit sandwich piled high, it was an open faced biscuit with all the trimmings and with a very sophisticated presentation.  As for the taste?  You betcha.  Granted for some this might be a bro too far on protein, but this was just what I needed.  The brisket was a great added bonus (no its not like Little Miss BBQ's brisket, but nothing is), and I really liked the way the avocado and ricotta toppings smoothed out the otherwise juicy and powerful meat flavors.  I can't tell what cheese they put on the on the biscuit itself (brie perhaps), but the biscuit was warm and plenty moist.  A great meal to start of my morning all around.  Ah, but there was an unexpected surprise just as I was finishing.  The waitress came by and plopped down a small breakfast quiche-like concoction compliments of the chef.  A fluffy biscuit like texture on the outside that was stuffed with potato, cheese, and bacon and with a variety of herbs to boot.  Now THAT'S how you make it to 5 stars on Yelp ladies and gentlemen.  The counter staff and wait staff alike were both upbeat and friendly my entire visit and the food was fantastic.  Great experience, great value.  Very happy to see this spot find some new life after several failed attempts by previous restauranteurs to make this space succeed.  Based on my experience, I'm optimistic this one will work out for the long haul.  Tuck Shop has worked for years now as a terrific dinner spot.  It was high time they got a next door neighbor serving equally worthy fare for the breakfast and lunch crowd.  Coronado folks, that spot has arrived.",

Their prices are great considering I used to spend more on some crap fast food on the way to work when I could get an amazing crepe(i do no artichoke cause the tart takes away from its epic-ness) for close to the same price.   I tried a few things here so I will just list what i like and dont like:  Like: Shepherd's biscuit - Great meal to split, its awesome but filling. I like it without the avocado, even though i like avocado its better without.  Mexican Breakfast Torte - It comes with different bread sometimes but I ask for the biscuit since I am not a fan of the blue corn bread. Also filling but tasty as hell.  Savory Crepe -  (-artichoke) That borsin cheese with the tomatoes and mushrooms are so darned tasty. The mushroom sauce is amazing and should be bottle and sold in stores.  Ganache chocolate cake  their version of shepherds pie with the phyllo is great  Their ciabatta toast  Chef makes perfect scrambled eggs better than anyone  ive never had an omelette but considering how awesome the eggs are I would assume its good.  Meh but still good:  Arepas - too similar to the torte but just not a fan  Hash - its good if you want light flavor  English Breakfast - not a fan of the sausage they have but still not bad  most of the specials I tried have been too similar or not as good as I expected but this is nit picking at this point.  The staff and owners are awesome people and always nice. I know some people are impatient but when food is this good, its worth the wait and the price is right.",

He wasn't wrong. Both of our meals were delicious and beautifully presented. When leaving, my husband wanted to show me the patio in back. I explained to the owner/chef why and on our way out of the restaurant, he handed me 2 cupcakes as a gift. It's pretty special to have a great meal AND have a pleasant conversation with an owner who clears loves and takes pride in what he is doing.",

    "text": "I can't believe this place has been open three years and I have not eaten here. I ate at this location back when it was the Asher house which was a wonderful little smoke/barbecue restaurant that went out of business.  They have lots of outdoor seating which is wonderful in the spring and fall, this being a colder winter day the warmth of the indoor seating, Was quite inviting. I am mediately was met with a cornucopia of wonderful smells as I came in the restaurant.  We were properly seated by JoJo a very bubbly server. All of the people working at the restaurant seemed quite friendly. We were immediately served coffee and flavored water. The flavored water was a very nice touch a combination of mint, honeydew melon, and lemon. That was a nice touch. They had a special that looked very interesting. It was a combination of eggs hashbrowns, gravy sausage pork belly on a toasted ciabatta I don' eat potatoes and bread that I did not order it. But two people at my table did and thoroughly enjoyed it. The one comment that I got from the people that ordered it was they wished the pork belly was cooked more like bacon instead of served in a softer almost like a thin baked pork chop.  Another person at our table had the crepe since she is a vegetarian. I did not taste it but it looked extremely tasty. It was done with a mushroom sauce that looked very flavorful and hearty.  I had an omelette with prosciutto, Portabella mushroom, Burrata cheese and sauteed arugula. I prefer a very fluffy and not overcooked omelette and this one was made to perfection. With tip our bill was just short of $20 a person. That might be considered pricey for breakfast. But the quality and the creativity well compensated for that cost. I would highly recommend this restaurant and will be back.",

It's no wonder they are almost always packed! We did have to wait a while to be served but the wait was worth it. I'd just recommend on continuing to invest in training your staff to be alert when the rush comes in but aside from that, the food and drinks are phenomenal!  I love their freshly pressed pear juice and they chai latte. Add an expresso shot for an extra 'wake me up' boost and enjoy! Their Tofu scramble omelet on a wheat tortilla was incredible. My 1.5yr old ate almost all of it himself!!! The seating area outside is really nice, and recommend outside seating when taking your kids because it can feel a little crammed inside. The owner is awesomely nice and cares about her customer's experience and the chef is super cool! Come by and check it out for yourself!",

I wish I could eat that every day, the sauce is just amazing. I want that sauce on everything.   My boyfriend enjoyed the Shepherd's Biscuit, which he totally loved, and our friends ordered the Crispy Naan and the English Breakfast - both vegetarian-style.  Their menu is a bit of a challenge for vegetarians - our friends are strict vegetarians and the girl who took our order didn't offer any substitutions for the meat they removed from the Naan and English Breakfast. She also seemed to rush us through the ordering process. However, the woman who was either a manager or the owner was really nice and was able to answer all of our questions. Everyone recommended the crepe, which is why I ordered it, and I'm so glad I did.  Docking one star for the vegetarian challenges/ inattentive order taker + their fly situation - we really wanted to sit on the patio because the weather was beautiful, but we were really annoyed by the flies once our food started to come out. We were lucky there was an open table inside so we could move.",

Solidly, so warmly and joyfully solidly has this new eatery exceeded my expectations with fresh and locally-sourced ingredients, served up in a friendly atmosphere, with a wonderfully varied menu.   It's a cozy open-kitchen set-up, with a huge patio out back and a small one out front (facing 12th St.)   I had my eye on veggies and eggs but when Anna at the register suggested Crab and Shrimp Benedict, it was like she won a mental match game. Of course that's what I really want! (Always) This dish was cooked perfectly, came with a huge slab of avocado and one part of the bread (not typical English muffin) was cheese and tomato.   It. Was. Perfect.   I did get the veggies & egg bowl (potatoes & brussel sprouts, two egg, etc to go.) Same outcome, hours later. And cold. Perfect!   You can't beat a chef with a passion his heart that you can taste on the plate. Duza himself is at the flames, masterfully creating not only delicious and flavorful meal combos, but also plating them with a straightforward artistry. He popped over to a couple tables with a sweet treat. (Try the baked goods!) There is a terrific lunch menu too; breakfast served until close at 2pm.",

Cute little neighborhood spot, delicious food, super friendly service, and a truly open kitchen.",

There was a broken-down piece of kitchen equipment sitting on a rickety old table and covered with an old tarp. The outside lighting that is supposed to accent the landscaping was broken. No one bothered to fix it and it was just laying as if nobody cared. The Masonite patio covers are warped and in disrepair. The table that held the water was broken, the water dispenser looked cloudy and dirty. The coffee and water tasted odd.. My toast which was made by them placing the bread on the grill tasted rancid. The potatoes also tasted like they were cooked on a grill that had not been cleaned in a long time. All of our food tasted odd. Just gross. The bill, although I saw that most of the menu items are priced separately, I might have been less disappointed if the experience was good. This was not a good experience and I will never go back. I don't care what the pictures of the food look like. The taste was awful.",

While looking for a breakfast/lunch restaurant located in Downtown to Midtown Phoenix to meet friends, I stumbled upon Duza's Kitchen when reviewing Yelp reviews.  And what a great stumble it was!  Immediately upon walking into the restaurant, which is located in a residential area in the Coronado District, you feel at home.  A young lady handed us menus and explained we ordered at the counter and the food would be delivered to our table.  She also pointed out the breakfast special of Prime Rib, Eggs, Potatoes and Mushrooms which was nicely plated and not made of plastic.  It was Father's Day so I'm not sure if they regularly have a breakfast special or if it was due to it being Father's Day.  I plan to return, so I'll find out!  One fellow diner's eyes lit up when hearing the special and said he didn't need to review the menu.  My other fellow diner opted for the House Hash (Prime beef, ham, smoked brisket, peppers, scallions, shallots, portabella mushroom potatoes & eggs) and my mouth was watering after reading the ingredients for the Pumpkin Quinoa Porridge (Quinoa, almond milk, sweet potato puree, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, flaxseed, organic agave syrup, and on top chopped candied pecans and shaved coconut).  Our selections did not disappoint, in fact each of us thought about licking our plates!  Several times we were asked about drink refills.  A young woman who turned out to be Duza's owner, came over to ask how we liked our food.  We all responded enthusiastically ... WE DIDN'T LIKE IT, WE LOVED IT!  She told us the restaurant has been open 9 months and things have gone well so far.  She is unsure how business will be in the summer.  Well if today, which was the hottest day of the year, is any indication; she will do just fine!  There was a nice steady crowd during the time we had the pleasure of being at Duza's.    If you are in the Coronado District or even if you are not, be sure to visit Duza's Kitchen - you will not be disappointed!  --Fork of Fork 'n Knife  Be sure to check out the reviews written by my fellow food critic, Knife of Knife 'n Fork.   Bon Appetite!",

The main reason it's good is because the food is real and fresh. I can see, know and identify every ingredient I'm eating. That matters in our family. And it's tasty! You can see the chef cooking your food in a very down home way and you can tell he cares about the food and his restaurant. I'm currently watching him clean and put away dishes.",

We had the Shepherd's Biscuit, Assorted French Toast and the special of the day which was empanadas.  It was all excellent!

The hash was a little under seasoned but nothing a little salt and pepper cant fix but once all mixed together was a nice hearty good portioned breakfast. The flaky biscuit was very flavorful with the 3 kinds of meat and the egg with the biscuit hit the spot.  My wife wish there was some type of gravy so she could soak it up with the biscuit.  The biscuits were nice and fluffy.  Overall the meal was a perfect portion and cooked with a light hand and restraint.  The only underwhelming thing which saddens me to only give it 4 out of 5 stars; is the lemonade we had was more like water with a bit of lemon and no sugar and my wifes coffee was bitter.  Not even the caramel she added could save it.  But definetly a nice quiet nook restaurant in the Coronado area to check out.  Just an FYI parking is off of oak across from the tuck shop and the entrance is on 12th street.  It took us a minute to figure it out.  Happy nom noms",

Pretty busy for breakfast on the weekends if you are a late riser. I recommend getting there before 9:30 if you want to eat right away.",

Duzas has top notch food, friendly people, and awesome service (food came out within 10 minutes, they checked on us twice, and offered a coffee to go). A couple runs it (one Bosnian, one Mexican) so the menu is really eclectic.. Difficult to pick one thing! I had the Arepas (first time) and they were made with black beans and delicious! My fiance had the house hash and also really enjoyed it. Thanks for a great experience, Duzas.",

    "text": "\"People who Love to eat are the Best People\"  It was our first time coming here and we originally came in for breakfast, however, we ended up getting lunch because their breakfast menu closes at 11 on weekdays. My boyfriend got the build your own sandwich with prime rib steak, with provolone cheese and topped it off with their chimchurri sauce. As for me, I got the pan-seared salmon. It came with this rectangular cracker and underneath it was this special white sauce (I'm unsure what it is) but it tasted so good with the cracker. On top of the cracker was seaweed salad, asparagus, and the salmon. All of the ingredients combined together was simply heavenly. Will come back hungry for more!",

Although the drinks are slightly over priced my only gripe about this place is the ability of the short cashier girl to follow my directions for the order. She's either can't hear well, doesn't like her job, or is just sadly dumb. The staff overall is polite and in a hurry. This is a classic hideaway brunch spot for all ages.",

Lucky for me it's a short bike ride away in the middle of a quiet part of the Coronado neighborhood.  They don't have a huge menu, but they don't need to - the options are clever and very well made.  Then there's always a special that changes all the time.  I want to try most of the things on the menu, but then I often get grabbed by the specials.  There's a cool, laid-back atmosphere, with nice front and back patios.  The staff is always super friendly and attentive.  Highly recommended.",
