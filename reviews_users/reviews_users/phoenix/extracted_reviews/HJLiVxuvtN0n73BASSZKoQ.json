After living in the middle east for half my life and searching for good middle eastern food in Arizona, I was beyond excited when I heard that New York's beloved Halal Guys will be gracing the streets of Tempe. The meat was ok-ok and lacked flavor. The tabouleh was alright as well. There was nothing special that would want to make me dish out nearly $10 for a bowl. It's overpriced and I would much rather go spend my money for real middle eastern food at Haji Baba or Paradise.",

Halal Guys has a reward program that I laughed at when I read the details, you need to get 50 sandwiches to get one free.  Ummm whats the point?  Also the employees don't seem humble when they are working, management will need to figure something out to keep them afloat when they lose the new restaurant traffic.        Return factor 50%",

Although the staff were very nice, the food was just sad, sad, sad. I had a combo plate with chicken & gyro meet and both were very bland and dry. Their famous white sauce was lacking flavor too. Also the pita bread that came with the combo plate tasted staled. Only thing that somewhat impressed me was their hot sauce. It had real kick but otherwise the food was not tasty at all and portion size was very small for $9. If you want real tasty Middle Eastern food, check out Al-Hana inside Baiz Market Place. So much better.",

Great flavor BUT stupid spicy. Proceed with caution on the hot sauce... And their food in general.   They also have bbq sauce... Wutthef@kchuck... Not exactly traditional. Their condiment choices are white sauce... Bbq sauce... And hot sauce.  Even when I ate here drunk, their food is seriously sub-par.

The hot sauce is freaking hot!!!!! Let this be a warning to you. It is not your average hot sauce. I used half of a packet and that was more than enough for me, it was soooo spicy and I can handle spicy pretty well. No wonder they only gave me 1 packet when I asked for the hot sauce on the side. The service was below average but I'll let that slide since they are brand new. They forgot my pita bread, which I didn't realize I was supposed to get until I heard someone else ask about it. The girl at the registered seemed to need a bit of help. But other than that I had a good dinner. Solid 4 stars. Wish there was better parking though, I parked behind the building and walked around front. Not sure if that's allowed?",

When I heard little ol' AZ was getting one, I was more than ecstatic to try this place. I knew from the pictures what I was expecting, but maybe I was expecting to be blown away by the taste or something.   Yes, the servers were nice, fast, and helpful. But the food is another topic. I ordered the combo platter (chicken and gyro meat) with spicy sauce and extra white sauce. The platter was mostly rice and lettuce. I normally like my food saucy, but I now I understand why everyone said to order extra white sauce. The food seemed dry and a little plain. The white sauce helped a lot. I will say, the hot sauce is SOO spicy. When I first saw them sparingly drizzle red sauce over my platter I thought they just being cautious; NO, it was spicy. Thank goodness they didn't add more.   Overall, I think there are plenty of other better middle eastern food around town.   Environment: 4/5 Food: 2/5 Price: 3/5 Service: 4/5",

I ordered the regular chicken & gyro combo plate with extra white sauce & extra hot sauce. This plate comes with rice, diced tomatoes & chopped ice berg lettuce. Without the white sauce, this dish is really plain. The white sauce is what actually makes the dish taste good.   The hot sauce on the other hand gives a really good kick. A little goes a long way. I feel like everything was really bland. I had to kind of drench it in white & hot sauce just to make it taste good.",

I have only ever had the gyro platter, or the combo chicken and gyro platter and they are STRAIGHT UP AWESOME!  I think they put a chemical in their hot sauce cause I can't seem to get enough of that either.  BTW, their hot sauce is no joke, it will hurt you if you're not careful.   Reason for 4 stars and not 5 is based on two reasons. The first and most important is that I drove 50 miles from home round trip to come here for takeout so my wife could try it, and once I got home and started eating, I found a big nasty gross pubic hair in my chow. I showed my wife and she confirmed this is what it was. It did put a bad taste in my mouth for awhile, and I don't think she'll ever come back. The second reason is because for there itty-bitty ketchup-sized sauce packets are like $0.61.  Overall one of my favorite places, even though it's a bit expensive.",

To be sure, it's not gourmet food or the best dining experience of your life, but it's good hearty and healthy food. I disagree with others who said the meat was bland. I got the combo platter and I was wary of the chicken being bland, but I found it to have a nice flavor and it was NOT dry which was most important of all. Also the lettuce did not take up 1/2 my platter, it was 1/3 at most. I couldn't finish the entire platter in one meal so I feel that it's a fair amount of food for the price. I really liked the rice and the gyro meat.  I ordered from uber eats and my platter came with 2 huge white sauce packets and spicy sauce. It was more than enough white sauce, I didn't even use 1 whole packet and I felt like it was more than enough white sauce. FYI the white sauce is their version of a tangy mayo. That spicy sauce is no joke! But I liked it. 1 spicy sauce is waaayy more than enough for an entire platter. If you can eat more spicy sauce than that, my hat's off to you!   Overall I would definitely order from here again!  Oh, but pass on the baklava - it's not great.",

    "text": "The Halal Guys is one of our favorite NYC stops.  Being from California, were excited to see this company expand into the West.  On short visit to Phoenix we stopped in to get the Halal we've come to love.  Short story: We got it.  We loved the food.  On a scale of 10, this place in Tempe is a solid 9 compared to the Manhattan Halal Guys.  I think there was less meat on my plate than the NY joints.  We didn't try the baklava or the falafels, but the gyro, chicken, rice, and french fries were perfectly prepared.  The white sauce is what makes the dish, don't skip it.  I got two rows of hot sauce but could have used a third.  I love it.   I have to mention my interactions with the manager. Nidal is amazing.  This GM will take this restaurant to heights unknown.  After chatting a bit, it was clear that his mission is customer service.  His goal is to perfect this restaurant.  HALAL GUYS - Nidal is your guy!    On food alone, I would leave a strong 4 star review, but because of the management, it is a 5 star restaurant.  Wish I lived closer to enjoy more frequent visits.  Well done Halal Guys.",

The tbl next to me put it best, This is not really worth $9-10 as I can get similar and even better food for less.  The falafel itself was crunchy and moist inside, however it lacked the flavor punch I am used to. The rice was fine nothing special same for the iceburg lettuce and tomato \"salad\"  a few soft peta points and that is a platter. They offer two sauces, White some may like dressing, and hot which truly is hot. However no tahini.  Sure it may have been on TV but you cant state what you see on tv.",

I can believe it is the real deal I eat Middle Eastern food everyday such as at the Tasty Kobob, YOS restaurant, Shawrma Paradise, Moroccan Paradise, and the good is soo much better and genuine, I used to love the Istanbul Cafe the food was way better and genuine compared to the fake colored food at Halal guys, unfortunately Istanbul Cafe has been closed for such a long time.   I think this restaurant is overly biased I am not arguing about the price it's not overly expensive however I feel like street food in Pennsylvania, New York, Washington Seattle, even Texas and Illinois Chicago is better than this !   I feel like they need to improve the rice and the meat, generating flavor with sauces is just like tricking people! However the Falafel is good !",

I have had more flavorful gyro meat at other fast dining places, such as Hummus Xpress. The white sauce was also nothing special. The pita triangles were served cold. I'm not sure if that's how they regularly come here, but pitas should be warm.  The staff was friendly and seemed to be trained well. I also appreciate that when they say \"hot sauce,\" they mean it. I usually scoff at people who say that their restaurant's sauce is really hot, and I'm usually right (I've done the Blazin' Challenge twice). This time, I decided to take their advice and just put a little on the side. I'm glad I did. Respect to them for providing a serious hot sauce!",

The yellow/orange rice is delicious. I skip the veggies because it is just lettuce and tomato. Some people like it, though. They have platters in two sizes. You can also get a combo. I love the falafel and chicken. Again, extra white sauce! It's cheap and the service is fast as well-extra bonuses.   If you give them a 5 star   review, you get free fries and a drink! Whoo!!   P.S. We stood in line on opening night for 45 min and met the owner the night before when my Nee Yorker bf \"had to have it\" and he is a super nice guy!   Awesome place! Awesome food! Awesome people!  5 stars in my opinion",

I tried to go to the opening day but the line was literally wrapped around the building.   So I decided to give it a few weeks and finally went yesterday night. There was still a slight line but primarily to Monitor the crowd almost like a club with a bouncer and he also gave a good description of the food and what to expect for the newbies. The line moved quickly though and so did the food line. Which again reminded me of the fast paced NY I miss.   The food did not disappoint at all!!! I ordered the Combo plate with chicken and gyro (pronounced Euro!!!) with the white sauce and 4 lines of the hot sauce. And trust me it was exactly like back home. The spice of the Hot sauce is not For the weak hearted but for me it was perfect and well worth the wait. So happy to have a piece of home in the desert.",

    "text": "We went to Halal Guys for dinner last night and I was very disappointed.   We were really excited to try it out since there has been so much hype leading up to their opening. Also, as a Middle Eastern food lover, I was excited for a new concept to come to the valley. However, I'm not sure that you could really call this Middle Eastern or Mediterranean food.  They only have two options on their menu: a pita wrap/sandwich, or a platter. Then you have your choice of meat: chicken, gyro, or falafel.  I ordered the platter which automatically comes with shredded iceberg lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and yellow rice. Then they top that with the meat(s) of your choice and a few slices of pita. They serve average pita like the type you could get at the grocery store. Their sauce options include white sauce, which is a mayo-based sauce, spicy sauce, or tahini, although you have to specifically request tahini.   Their food is extremely bland, and it is severely lacking something fresh - which may sound strange because half of my plate was shredded lettuce, but it lacks some type of vinegar - whether it's pickles, olives, or some type of dressing. Also, their hot sauce is so spicy that you can't even enjoy it, I'm not sure why they bother making it. It would be nice if they had a few different types of hot sauce, maybe something along the lines of a mild herb-based sauce, a medium sauce, and then their extraordinarily hot sauce.   All in all, I won't be back. I'd rather go elsewhere and spend less for more flavor and more authentic food.",

    "text": "Only a little more than other Reviewers to contribute.  Yes, the \"regular\" Combo Plate (pictured) portion (mostly rice & iceberg) is large, the service was fast & friendly and they're open late, but other than that ... meh?  The very bright orange rice and chicken & gyro meats were a dry and the overall flavor (including that of the iceberg and diced tomatoes) was bland.  The \"White Sauce\" (pictured) did add some flavor.  By the admission of one female Employee, it's very similar (but more liquid-y) to mayonnaise.  Personally, I'm not a big fan of mayo on gyro meat, rice or salad fixings.  I also ordered French Fries (pictured).  Again, the portion size was large and they were served hot, but lacked ANY salt for flavor.  Had the male Employee who made them bothered to wash his hands after handling a broom (and possibly other cleaning chemicals / supplies), I may have been more comfortable eating them.  The price was a little on the high side.  The Combo Platter with French Fries (but no drink) plus tax was over $12.  This part of town (and others) has too much competition for Middle Eastern food to price it as such, especially considering the food quality and handling / sanitation concerns.  In sum, ok, but there is plenty of room for improvement.",

Really enjoyed all three items.  Fresh and tasty.  Because they don't have a huge menu, I think they can keep their eye on being good and consistent.  They even came and picked up our trays.

It did nothing to detract from the greasy meat like a typical cool, cucumbery Tzatziki should. They give you one little piece of pita with the giant portion of rice and meat topping. After that was gone, it was impossible to finish that oily disgusting mess. Rice wasn't too bad but the meat was supposed to be the star of the show.

The white sauce was really good, can't get enough of it so there's 1 bottle by drink station. The hot sauce it very pica ! It's a whole other kind of heat the more you eat the hotter it seemed to get so only get a few lines when ordering or packets on the side.

All you get is your meat which is honestly sub par at best and you get rice and salad which is just a handful of lettuce... They give you an option for hot sauce and white sauce. The hot sauce is the only good thing they have going for them because I love spicy food and the hot sauce here is comparable to the Buffalo Wild Wings blazing sauce, perhaps even Hotter. Too bad the food here isn't worth it. The white sauce is some kind of mayo dressing that's loaded with fat. Literally not kidding, one packet of white sauce dressing has 33grams of fat! If you're watching your macros skip the white sauce, I see that many people enjoy it and drench their bowls with it, but I wonder if they know the facts. Anyways as far as improvements, if they want to compete with real Mediterranean joints then I suggest making veggie options and better overall quality food. For the price I'll stick to Hummus Xpress on Hardy & University, as they give you much better flavourful food which includes: real salad, very good humus, better meat, and hot veggies (Fried eggplant, glazed carrots,Lemon pepper broccoli etc.), not just lettuce, and a variety of toppings you can add for free.",

The place looks like any fast food chain, we ordered chicken platter. The rice they add is really good and thats the only thing which i liked. The chicken was too bland and didn't find it fresh. My bowl was filled with lettuce . The sauce was good but its like any other Mediterranean sauce.   I was not impressed and did not like the food, does not look like any picture or video that ran on television in the restaurant. Price is reasonable",

    "text": "There's only so much rice and chicken that I can actually eat, until I get sick of it.   I was super excited about going to Halal Guys! I've heard about this chain based off in New York and how people were raving about how good the chicken and rice combo is. When I got there, it was clean and kinda set up like a fusion between Chipotle and Five Guys.   I got the Large chicken and gyro combo and they definitely give you pretty reasonable portions here! You are able to choose some additional condiments to add to your rice plate, as well as if you want to add a sauce to it. Of course they recommended to add the white sauce, which is a fusion between a plain yogurt and ranch dressing.   The plate I got was good. There wasn't anything to \"rave\" about when it came to their chicken though. You can seriously get some more flavorful chicken at places like let's say Panda Express of Yogi Grill. The basmati rice was good, however by itself is a little bland. That's what the sauce is for.   Overall, I'm most likely not gonna come back here for awhile. Service was excellent, however the kind of Mediterranean/Greek influenced style food was alright. I feel I can get better tastes of gyros and stuff at actual Greek restaurants etc. But then again, maybe I just don't crave this kind of food!  Tips 1) Dont get too much of that red hot sauce!!!! It's super spicy! You will suffer if you put too much on your rice 2) get a normal rice plate, should definitely be enough to fill you up",

Both the Beef and Chicken are pretty good and we selected the white sauce over the meats. I am more a beef gyro person, but the chicken was also good and juicy considering it was mainly white meat and I prefer dark meat.  The combo platter comes in two sizes and includes a salad with slices of pita.   Could really do without the Falafel which is a deep fried ball of peas.  The menu is simple and the counter is quick with prices geared more for lunch style prices.   This restaurant was very hiped up coming to Tempe next to ASU and is in a nice small strip mall just North of the Dutch Bros. The good thing is the strip mall has not only Halal Guys but Even Stevens Sandwich Shop and Ahipoki getting ready to open soon.  Will definitely be back when I am around ASU.",

I said excuse me three times, and no one responded. So I went and grabbed a prepackaged fork set from near the register. Then I attempted to leave and was verbally yelled at by one of the workers for going in back. I explained that I had waited for them, called for them, and was in a rush and needed a fork!!! Just a fork! And proceeded to be verbally accosted for doing so. The guy had gauges and was in his 20s, wearing a black hat. Still cannot believe I was screamed at for grabbing a fork when they were completely out on the floor. Like what.",

I went here in between Uber rides as I do a lot of Uber Eats pickups from this spot and I love Mediterranean food. Upon walking in, I noticed that you can either order a platter or a pita wrap. In an effort to maintain my hourglass figure, I went for the platter without rice (too many carbs and it's cooked in chicken stock). Basically I ended up with three or four falafels on top of a bed of shredded lettuce with some pita wedges. The falafels aren't made in house...they come in frozen in a big bag and then are dropped in the frier. They taste just ok.   The staff that works here is awesome...so friendly and helpful. They asked if I wanted tahini on top of the falafel, which is awesome...and then they cautioned me about the red sauce. I feel a proper expectation was set for how hot that stuff is.   I think next time I'll try a wrap because there are other things you can add to it such as olives, cucumbers, etc.",

When I received my order I didn't have any fries, there was lettuce and tomatoes included, and they put extra sauce. I already had to wait 40 minutes for this order.  I called Uber eats, they processed me a refund, they told me that I could get a five dollar discount and that it would be available if I re-ordered immediately. So I did, re-ordered immediately. I waited another hour this time. And when my food came there was no sauce on the food, I still got lettuce and tomatoes instead of all rice. And I got my fries this time, but they taste like they're old, and I don't think fries are supposed to be chewy. Undercooked? It's kind of sad, because I was really looking forward to this place for months. I'm hoping they do something for me to compensate for this inconvenience.",

So, don't be afraid to give it a try. It's quite decent except for the pita/flat bread thingy smells like plastic and a tad too soggy, but that's minor considering this is a fast food place.  Food portion 3/5  They need to balance out the amount of lettuce n rice, mine didn't come with nearly enough rice.  Service 4/5  Quick n courteous, just need to be a bit more clear of the procedure in the sauce section.  Packaging 0/5 My lid was loose ( I told them Togo) so use your best imagination to picture my lunch.  Price: Not cheap, but Arizona experience 25% minimum wage increase in January 2017, not their fault.   So I probably need to comeback in a few months to give them another try once they work on the kinks.",

    "text": "I give this place one star. I would give it less but they did at least manage to open a restaurant and serve food. We had heard all the hype about this place \"finally coming to town\" so we were looking forward to trying it. We did order it through uber eats so I can't comment on service, atmosphere, or staff friendliness. I will say the order was correct and warm when it arrived so that's a plus. That's it for the pluses. Everything went downhill from there. I would describe the food as bland and flavorless. We ordered some chicken platters and some gyros. The platters were almost all lettuce not much chicken. The rest of the veggies looked sort of sad and colorless. The white sauce was fine. Not flavorful but not terrible. Just sort of there. I put in on my food to try and improve the experience. If it did nothing for flavor, at least it gave me the activity of tearing open the packets to squeeze out the product and take my mind off the food I was eating. Just packets of sauce. Nothing fancy there.   The hot sauce? HOT. Silly hot. Not enjoyable hot. I will tell you I am not a huge fan of hot sauces in general, especially not the painful ones so maybe it's not fair for me to weigh in on it but I did. I tried to add the hot sauce to the flavorless food to help it but all it did was anger me.   I ate the food because I was hungry and it did provide sustenance but that's it. We will not waste time with this again when there are dozens of other local places and even more chains and fast dining establishments.   Check it out if you need Late night food but I wouldn't waste your time, money, or energy.",

I had read all the great reviews about this place and was expecting the food to taste like I had tasted it in some countries around the Mediterranean Sea. It was like one reviewer described very BLAND. Nothing worth to make the trip back to this place. There are several places in Tempe that have the same kind of food which come closer to the taste profile of how this kind of food should taste.   However two positive things that are an important part of the whole dining experience is the level of customer service and the cleanliness of the place. This place excelled in both. That's why I gave them 2 stars. Unfortunately the food makes up the greatest part of giving them 3 less stars than what they could have gotten......",

I got the regular combo which has chicken and gyro over rice with four pieces of pita bread.   Honestly everything tasted so bland.. Chicken was dry, gyro was so oily, rice was hard and too bland. There was no special taste to the platter. I added the white sauce and that is basically what makes the platter taste very good, without it the dish is very plain and bland.   Kudos to them for opening very late and right next to a university. Service was nice and helpful. I would definitely be back to try other dishes but I wouldn't get the platter again. (:",

We scored...it's spring break so lines were not long.  The menu is simple and ordering is easy. There was only one person prepping food. It would have been a bit faster had there been two people working the station, but no major complaint. The line stilled moved quickly.    I had the regular size falafel meal.  I could not finish it. The falafel was tasty as was the rice. The side salad was fresh and was delicious with their special white sauce. (The sauce was actually lightly poured on everything and I loved it.)  Their hot sauce is super spicy and tasty. It's hotter than sriracha so watch out. I got a slow burn in my tummy about 15 minutes later, but nothing that diet coke couldn't cure. Yup, it's that hot.   Seating is close together inside and kind of sparse outside. I wouldn't expect to get a table during prime times, so you may want to plan to get it to go.   Service was good--- friendly and efficient staff and the it's clean too. My only teeny tiny criticism is that the fork handles are short. I had to maneuver my fork in the bowl to get at the good bits. If my only complaint is short fork handles, you know this place is good! I'll be back!",

LOL   The Halal Guys were a midtown operation, but very similar.  \"Halal meats that are seasoned to perfection and a melting pot of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean flavors that are sure to delight.\"  You should know, that Halal, Halaal, or  food is not the same as Greek food. It's middle eastern in origins, but tastes subtly different. You'll find no Kronos lamb spinning here either.   They serve their food steamed (photos), not fried -- on a plate with chicken or beef type gyro meat(photo), over rice and bed of iceberg lettuce, covered in their proprietary (creamy mayo) White Sauce.   We really liked our food. We ordered the combo plater of beef and chicken; with a sides four falafel balls with tahini sauce and a small bowl of humus. We also grabbed a beef gyro to go. LOL  The rice was very tasty and we found the meat to be slightly bland, but their sauce made up for it. If you enjoy heat, you'll have to try their chili paste based Hot Sauce. I loved it, a 8/10 alarm'er.   So Three Stars, \"A-Okay\".",

    "text": "Thought this place was just called \"Halal Guys\", sans the article. I digress already. Came with a friend of mine who was also excited about their opening; she tried them in NYC and it was my first time. I arrived around noon and it was busy with a short line outside to regulate traffic inside the restaurant. Lots of employees working, making food preparation quick and efficient. I got the small falafel platter ($7.95) with white sauce and tahini and a packet of hot sauce on the side.   I snagged a table outside for us to sit and waited a few minutes as my friend got her food. The platter has your choice of protein and rice, lettuce, tomatoes and pita bread. My portion was a good size for me as I finished it in one sitting. After all the hype, it's hard not to get my expectations up but there they were, hanging out with the clouds. After trying them out, they were humbly lowered back down to earth. I didn't find my food to be anything spectacular; it was lacking sauce and the hot sauce was pure heat, no flavor. I'm glad I got tipped off to get it on the side. The bowl seemed like something I could easily replicate at home.   Food wasn't bad, but wasn't amazing either. I wouldn't not go again, but it isn't at the top of my list to go back soon. Good effort guys, and nice customer service!",

That's almost unheard of in Arizona - sadly - unless you want whataburger or filiberto's. The staff are always extremely nice and helpful no matter how busy they get.   I always order the same thing: a regular chicken and gyro meat combo platter. Their white sauce is so addicting and I always get extra of it along with their red sauce. Whenever I ask for their red sauce they pause, look up and say \"have you ever had our red sauce?\" Because it's super hot to others lol; but I have a high tolerance for spiciness so it doesn't bother me. As for others I know, they cannot handle its spice level so I would say be cautious I guess.   Cons: i wish it didn't take an eternity to collect enough points towards a free platter. I feel they should give out more points per purchase. But you do get a free platter on your birthday! Also, I noticed they changed the type of chicken they use and I miss the old one which was shredded chicken and it might have been white meat? Now, they are dark meat chunks, but to be fair, the people I know prefer it the way it is now.   Again, it's so nice to have a different type of food option that is open late with such nice staff. Definitely try it out.",

My son and I chose the chicken and gyro combo, which came with plenty of both.  The rice was very good, there was a small salad of lettuce and tomatoes, and the extras of onion, green peppers, and olives added a lot of flavor -- especially those olives.   On the sauces, unless someone is adventurous or likes things pretty spicy, I'd advise sticking to the white sauce.  It's a spiced up yogurt blend that I think of as Ranch Jr.  When the server asks if you want more, say yes because the usual portion isn't enough.    Two sizes are offered.  The large is only $1 more than the small and a lot bigger.  Both my son and I couldn't finish ours, so took them home for another meal.  I also bought a 2-piece box of baklava, thinking we could have it later.  But my son declined -- and yay! to that.  It was excellent.",

    "text": "I'm originally from NY so I was pretty excited to hear that Halal guys were opening a store close to where I lived. I went the day after it opened (around 5:30pm) and the lines were still out the door. It took abt ~20min to get from where we stood in line to ordering our food. An employee was handing out stickers.   There are apparently 2 sizes you can order if you get the platter. I ordered the large [~$9] combo platter, which is the equivalent to the NY one size only platter. Half of the platter consisted of iceberg lettuce and tomatoes and the other half was rice and meat, but more rice than meat. So, it was pretty disappointing for them to skimp out on food. Usually, lettuce is only supposed to fill 1/4 of the container. I heard from several friends that it seemed healthier (not in a good way) bc there wasn't a nice layer of oil covering the bottom once you ate the whole thing. The meat wasn't as flavorful - maybe the taste will improve in some weeks or so~  There were about 7 or 8 two-seater tables inside and ~2 four-seater tables outside. It was a battle to grab a table and then keep it - employees and customers alike gave us so much heat it felt pretty uncomfortable.   There's a parking lot! However, Dutch bros is right next to this food plaza and they currently have a one way drive through that some cars actually confused as another entrance into the halal guys' parking lot and you can imagine there were a lot of angry drivers and loud honking. So be careful that the parking lot entrance you're entering is the right one!   Overall, I'm glad I can indulge in halal food whnever I crave it, so I can't complain too much.",

I got the falafel platter and loaded it up on the white and hot sauce. The boy serving me seemed incredulous when I asked for ten lines of the hot sauce. (He really asked how many lines.) Boyfriend got the combo platter.  Both platters came to be around $20 total. A little pricy, but they are in a PRIMO location across ASU so they must need to pay the rent.  The owner - I think - asked me and my boyfriend how we were doing as we stood in line. Unfortunately, I wasn't really looking at him and didn't realize he was talking to us until I noticed he was looking at my boyfriend, and even then I was assuming he was talking to the group behind. I'm a little slow, ok.  We came at Saturday morning at 1am... so basically Friday night and it was still pretty busy... but the line moved fast.  Contemplating trying to baklava next time. And I'd probably ask for even more hot and white sauce next time!",

First and last visit; what a waste of money. There are lots of great Greek places around. Don't bother with this knock-off of what should be delicious, fresh and flavorful food.",

Imagine my anticipation when I learned there was a location at home in the Valley!  But for me, this location felt like a Pass/Fail assignment in college. The components were all there - the meat, sauces, rice, veggies, pita. Chicken and beef tasted as I expected, as did the classic white sauce and spicy red sauce. Eating here is the classic Halal Guys flavor.  Yet with that solid foundation, it never goes further than that. Literally everywhere I've seen more fun iterations, such as a loaded fries instead of a platter. Or for the gluttons, there are more sub-upgrades within platters such as extra meat or rice that didn't break the bank. Here, what you see is what you get.   I think if I lived on campus, this might be a solid stop. But I feel like something's wrong if at dinner time Dutch Bros. is full but this place is nearly empty. I think I can better understand the lukewarm reaction Tempe has for this spot.",

    "text": "Not near as good as in NY. This visit was below my expectations. The meats were dry as well as the rice. The food was so dry I could feel it getting stuck in my throat. The pita bread also had a strange taste to it, not sure what was going on with it. In NY they are making it fresh on the carts...maybe that was the difference? My husband and I wanted to control the amount of red sauce on it when we got home to eat, so we asked for togo packets of the red sauce. Beware---they charge a bunch for the togo sauce, but if you dine in, you get unlimited free sauce...Wish we would have stayed to eat as my food was so dry that I wish I could have added a TON more white sauce to help. Very bummed about this whole experience, just going to stick to the real deal when we go to NY.",

We always seem to get there are the perfect time with no wait but it's usually pretty busy. The white sauce and the pita bread ROCK!",

My first time there, I was wondering why they didn't spread that sauce all around my platter and then I tasted the sauce and my mouth was on  with just one little taste. The employees are always super nice and efficient. The dining areas are clean. Everyone is always working and there's something about that makes me feel like this place really has a good system going. Only thing I wish would improve is the falafel. It's pretty hard on the outside and not always warm. All in all I'm a happy customer and I go probably once a week to satisfy my cravings!!",

Yes it was opening day but in a chipotle style restaurant you expect them  to be fast. We were still excited to try it though because we had heard such good things about it and were very disappointed with the food. The white sauce was just mayonaise and they put a ton on and the hot sauce was very good but they put way too much on. The lack of pita bread was quite sad, they give you 3 little peices in their largest meal size and you really need it with food like that. I wont be going back soon anytime soon even with my half off a gyro coupon.",

    "text": "This is my second time eating halal guys. Unfortunately each time I was really hungry and the food was so good I could not take a pic for food presentation...my bad. Ok the first trip it was packed on a Saturday night! But the line moved very swiftly. I ordered the combo chicken and gyro platter with white and hot sauce, 2 falafel, baklava, and a fountain drink for a reasonable price imo. Then as I am paying the card demon hit and bam my card was declined! So in this packed establishment my card wouldn't go through and I knew I had the money! So I sit in a corner embarrassed and on hold with my financial institution. So as I'm holding and my bank is trying to get my card working during their maintenance / update, the Halal Guys manager comes up to me with my order and a fountain cup and said \"this one is on us tonight,\" *my mouth dropped. \"Oh no sir it's ok I really have the money!\" And then he said \"well I already entered it comped so you couldn't pay if you wanted to.\" And then he smiled. My card eventually worked that night but the kindness has one this place a new long time customer! Now to the food...I know ya'll didn't think just cause the manager was so nice I'd let the food review slide. No worries the food was excellent! I enjoy just mixing the whole platter together and have the flavors dance in harmony on my palate. Very tender meat, very very good baklava, and the hot sauce!... some may want to use sparingly, but if you like spicy I suggest a nickel size portion of it is fine. We'll gotta go finish my platter",

The pita was also perfect size, not to much and not to little. I can't wait for them to open up more so it is not so far away from my home. It makes a great date night.

The chicken was cooked right and not dry but all I could taste was salt and pepper. The beef cooked gyro style was pretty good. Decent portion of meats. The two sauces are white and red. The white would've been yogurt and onions combo on the cart in NYC... This I could barely taste  the red is the chili sauce and they ask how many lines you want of each (is this coke they sellin?). I got 5 white 7 red mouth was on fire! I happened to have tzatiki in the car (no lie) but it was still burning my mouth. Glad I got baklava to offset but wasn't enough. Like some other reviews said there are handful of middle eastern joints around asu that you wouldn't have to wait in line for and like even better.... Haji baba comes to mind but I've been away from that area for ten years. Either way glad I tried it.... Not in a rush to go back but it was edible.",

I usually love hot sauce and eat it on everything but this was not hot sauce, this was fire sauce. It was so hot I literally could not even finish my food. My mouth, lips and nose were burning and you can't fast any flavor other than hot. You should really warn people that the hot sauce is this hot or not even offer it to be put on. It's ridiculously hot. It's not even remotely tasty. It took an hour of me drinking ice cold water for my lips to stop burning. Ridiculous!!",

She already missed half of what I ordered, even though I repeated myself 2 or 3 times. I was already watching closely because I watched the guy at the cash register start handling food after taking money from another customer without washing his hands or at least changing his gloves. The person making my food did the same thing, took cash and then started to make the rest of the order, without washing her hands or changing gloves and had touched all of the bread that was being kept warm on the grill.

Apparently this place is big in NYC, and the pictures of the food there and here look absolutely identical. So I can only assume that NYC has abysmal options for Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food. That's not the case in the PHX area. Do another Yelp search and chose something else. It's too easy to improve on this. Besides there are plenty of really delicious places selling way better Mediterranean\\Middle Eastern food.",

The first time I was unimpressed with the meat inside the gyro -- whatever that meat is supposed to be and the fact that it is chopped up, the consistency. For $8 you can surely get a real gyro in Tempe, like at Princess or Haji-Baba's (heck, even a faux middle-eastern place like Pita Jungle will do you a better pita than this fast food attempt at gyros for the same price). I tried adding some of the \"famous white sauce\" to help with the flavour, but I still didn't finish the gyro that my friend had acquired by take out. And the prices! Why would people pay sit-down restaurant prices for FAST FOOD?! So....yesterday was the second time to assess The Halal Guys, take out once again, a year later. The unthinkable happened: I bit into the gyro and was chewing my food, set the sandwich down, and then to my disbelief I watched a bug crawl out of the sandwich! I went online to see if they had any health violations, but could not locate any specific Tempe violations (there are so many Halal Guys locations, with varying degress of fast food health pass/fail scores). I AM a picky eater, but this is beyond bad.",

If you don't already know, Halal Guys is famous for its standard \"chicken/lamb over rice\" platter and duo of sauces (\"white sauce\" and \"red sauce\") that add all the flavor. No matter which Halal Guys you go to, you're going to be met with these basic options. Yet, every Halal Guys around the U.S. still manages to offer a slightly different taste and overall experience.   At this particular Halal Guys, I recommend the gyro platter over the chicken -- the gyro is plentiful in flavor where the chicken lacks. I also recommend checking the Hooked App before making your purchase, they frequently offer coupons that could score you a discount on your meal and sometimes free baklava, fries, and a drink. If you are going to choose between fries and baklava, I say go for the baklava. Halal Guys offers crinkle-cut fries, a fry that proves time and time again to be a disappointment. Their crisp-to-fluff ratio is nothing short of absurd.    It's not all bad here though, in fact the service here is quite speedy, the location is directly across from ASU, and there is plenty of parking and seating inside. Don't expect it to live up to the hype of NYC Halal Cart, but don't be bummed either --- this location is better than many of the other chains sprouting up around the West Coast.",

This place was aight but definitely not as good or fresh as the food back home.   I took the Yelp tips seriously and ordered extra extra sauce on my mixed falafel and chicken bowl. I also opted against the supposedly super duper hot sauce. I think the extra sauce helped moisten the (somewhat dry) chicken and the (not so great) falafels. In the bowl, there was shredded taco-like lettuce and tomatoes that didn't add much to the flavor. The pita bread was dry and definitely wasn't fresh. Bowl toppings were limited and the kalamata olives added the most flavor. The small side of hummus ($1) wasn't the best and I actually ended up throwing it away. All in all, the food seemed a bit prefabricated and didn't seem as authentic or homemade as what I'm used to.   I am sure this place is a nice, convenient option for some folks. The service was pleasant and efficient. I am glad I gave it a shot but I think I'd opt for another spot for my next Middle Eastern cuisine fix.",

I do remember eating like so as a younger man, but I tell I can only handle these kinds of meals once in a year maybe!  I ordered a larger halal plate as it came with some basmati rice, beef, chicken, iceberg, falafel, and topped with their special mayo-like white sauce.  I added a small dip of their spicy sauce on the side; and I'm glad I did so cause man that sauce was too spicy for me!  Overall, the lettuce and falafel helped with the texture providing a subtle crunch.  The chicken and beef was uber tender and soft to the bite.  The mayo sauce is what makes this dish pop!  However, it definitely was nothing like compared to what I had in NYC; not trying to knock it,but just based on shear experience having to hold a warm plate of food eating on the street corners of NYC.  Something about it, but maybe it's just in my head too!  In the end, The Halal Guys is worth the try since it's definitely affordable for a big plate of food and just something different! - Enjoy!",

    "text": "I had been wanting to check out The Halal Guys ever since they opened up in my area, so on a night I didn't feel like cooking dinner I headed on over!  Arrived a little before 5pm, it wasn't too busy, leaned you can either get a sandwich or a platter, I went with the chicken sandwich and ordered a side of falafel.  The chicken sandwich came on a nice warm pita, the chicken was tender and juicy had nice flavor to it, the sandwich had lettuce and it comes with a white sauce & and I also asked for the hot sauce too. This was a messy sandwich, but ooohhh sooo good!  I have to say though I was surprise with the side of falafel, there are 4 pieces of nicely fried falafel, but it did not come with any sauce, which I guess I expected it to, so by themselves with no sauce, they were little dry. Next time order a side of sauce or just make it a falafel sandwich.   Glad The Halal Guys are in the neighborhood and I'm sure I will be back soon.",

    "text": "\"I like it a little spicy but not too spicy... like J-Lo in pajamas.\"  Craig Ferguson, on The Chew  Any leftover, residue, stubborn, clingy germs from my cold a few weeks ago sprang back to life with the bit of red sauce I used.  I'm still coughing up a lung a few hours after eating!  Whoa!  Be careful with that red sauce, folks!  From a humble street cart in 1990 to becoming an international eatery, The Halal Guys have made it.  We ordered a side order of falafel, a Combo Platter [chicken & beef gyro], and a Falafel Platter.  I must admit that the falafel was a let down.  They were a bit dry and bland but a splash of White Sauce and a drop of Red Sauce fixed that up.  But when you're trying to not get an ass like Nicki Minaj, using excess White Sauce [seems like the love-child of mayo and Greek yogurt] to save your food is upsetting.  I would say the Combo Platter is the way to go.  Platters are a filling and simple dish of iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, and some rice.  3.5 stars!  At $9 for the large \"regular\" platter [I couldn't even finish half] combined with the late hours, I'm sure I'll be back.",

    "text": "Halal Guys was decent. This chain sells basically fast food Middle Eastern dishes. The menu is limited to chicken, gyro and falafel as your base to go in either sandwich or platter form.   I went with the small size falafel platter. Half of it was filled with iceberg lettuce salad, and the other half was filled with seasoned rice. 4 small falafel pieces were placed on top along with a few pieces of pita triangle. You have your choice of add ins (I added onion, jalapeno, and olive) and you will also have your choice of white, hot, or BBQ sauce. I went with white and hot sauce.   Overall, I wasn't too impressed. For $8 I would have liked something additional to go with the pita triangles, such as a scoop of hummus or baba ganoush. The falafel pieces were pretty small, rock hard on the outside, with a slightly moist filling. The falafel looked mass-produced as if they came from a mold since they had more of a gumdrop rather than spherical shape. For a platter filled only with inexpensive salad+rice with tiny falafel and few pita triangles I think it was definitely overpriced.   My husband had the gyro sandwich which he said was pretty good. The gyro meat didn't look like your typical thinly sliced meat from a spit. It was more like small chunks of meat, and he said it was well seasoned and tender.  As for the sauces, I liked the white sauce with its mild creamy flavor and the red hot sauce packed quite a punch!   If I go here again I'll skip on getting the falafel and will probably try one of the sandwiches.",

I did a combo of the white sauce and bbq- perfect together. I did light sauce since they tend to put a lot on (I think most people would prefer more but I'm more health conscious). Most of the excess calories and sugars come from that white sauce (but it is super yummy). I actually think the bowl without pita and light sauce is a healthy athletic option- good quality calories in a good blend of protein, carbs and fat.  EXCEPT: I wish they made the white sauce with better ingredients- if they used olive oil instead of nutritionally poor oils, I'd eat it way more often (I avoid bad fats as much as I can).  Definitely still 5 stars and a big plus that they are open pretty late. Phoenix area just doesn't have much in the way of variety in late night food. Cheers",

The gyro was AMAZING and the white sauce was to die for. I can drink that sauce all up in a cup! The falafel was good, but not quite like how Sabuddy's used to make them, but the white sauce fixed that. My friends got French fries for the kids and honestly it was really good crispy fries.

I love hot food so when they said the hot sauce was hot I didn't believe them and... It's really hot lol. The white sauce is so good . The flavors were on point and the meatvwas seasoned and grilled perfectly.  I will be a regular customer here.",

My bf ordered a gyro sandwich no tomato, I ordered a falafel sandwich, that's it. Simple & to the point. No sides, no drinks, nothing but two sandwiches. Unfortunately when they started to make our sandwiches, they got mixed up. No big deal, right? Just take the tomato off the gyro, & add some to mine... but NO, they threw BOTH sandwiches away after we had already waited 15 minutes for them to be prepared.  I absolutely hate wasting food, especially meat dishes because it's terrible to think an animal lived it's whole life just to be thrown away. Plus it's insanely wasteful & bad for overhead & eventually pricing.  The employees never once apologized, they were all rude & running around like chickens with they're heads cut off.  They're lack of customer service & over-all frantic energy made us leave without getting our food. This was my first & last experience with Halal Guys.",

The falafel were dry, dense, deflated, thieves of joy. I had (or tried to have)the chicken gyro combo. The tomatoes tasted weird, the chicken was dry and scratchy, the gyro was clumpy and spongy. The hummus was grainy under salted and funky.  I didn't want to throw $29 away but I didn't have the heart to feed it to my dogs.",

    "text": "I rate all restaurants on the same consistent fair standards of food taste/quality, service, cleanliness and value.  However I weight my reviews based on the measure of how much effort the owner puts into their work ... hence a mom & pop one-location place that is struggling and not yet quite on point may get a higher rating from me to encourage them and others to give them a chance than a pretentious trendy corporate conglomerate that thinks high prices equate to high quality but they are lazy, sloppy and serve sub-par food.  Here is why this place didn't cut it for me.  SERVICE  Pitiful. With the lone exception of the inadequately trained and overwhelmed greeter who starts your order, who valiantly struggled to work under incredibly negative conditions with co-workers who were rude, indifferent and lazy. He deserves better than to work here.  FOOD TASTE/QUALITY  I had a Gyro platter which was supposed to be chicken and gyro meat.  Except they ran out of chicken and said it would be at least 20 minutes to make some.  Despite having a vertical rotisserie in plain sight I never saw them use it. The meat was scooped from a huge food service steam tray. The words that come to mind to describe it are fake bac'n bits, low-grade jerky or puppy treats - it was dry, chewy and tasteless. This was served over the driest bright yellow rice I've ever had (I seriously thought it was old dried out shredded American cheese).  Optionally you can add lettuce that's poured pre-chopped from humongous vats that look like a case of e-coli waiting to happen and some thin dry slices of pita.  It's all drenched in a tasteless \"white sauce\".  CLEANLINESS  This place reminds me of an army mess hall. The benches are bare concrete and the tables are never cleaned. It's typical fast-food fare.  VALUE  At ten bucks my combo plate was a poor value by any standard.",

Being on the keto diet it's basically salad bowls at most places I go. Chipotle, Cafe Rio, etc. I don't enjoy them, I eat them in a pinch. But this I enjoyed. The beef was really flavorful and the sauce made the dish. The hot sauce is actually hot. I'm talking army of one hot. Not like those places where you order their spicy dish, then they warn you that it's spicy, and it's literally tomato sauce with a pinch of pepper.",

To our surprise this place was open late (in fact, very late today, open until 4 AM).  This place is a one of those strip type store fronts with about 6 businesses.  The only draw back could be the that they share a entrance with Dutch Bros Coffee.  So during peak periods could be difficult getting to park.  Once we walked in, we were immediately greeted by a friendly gentleman.  My family ordered chicken gyro \"sandwiches\" and I order the beef.  The guy that prepped the food was quick and really stuffed these sandwiches/wraps with everything.  I was really pleased with how well the meats were flavored, some places don't season enough, but no questions asked here.  The actual store front dining area has about 12 tables that will seat about 4 each...a nice medium size place.  Everything appeared to be clean.  I would definitely be back for a quick complete sandwich.",

Some of the people are a little more free with the sauce than others and you might end up with more spice than you intend.",

The fun stopped there. DoorDash delivered (driver was great 5 stars) temperature of food was what we expected. Now time to eat. First bite is always the pita bread, exciting...no. It was stale and dry and meh. Okay open the container, little pieces if chopped up gyro, chicken, rice, iceberg (who even uses that anymore?), and diced tomatoes. Looks good, wait is the gyro meat actually curling up do to dryness? Yes it is. Sigh...no worries I'll fix that with some delicious tzatziki, wait there's no tzatziki??? But there is \"white sauce\" WTHECK is that??? Thinking it's ranch. Sigh....ok. So,  let's wrap this up with this...food was cold, over cooked, dry, old, and inedible. Can we get our $30 back. Beware of Greeks bearing old dried food. You have been warned.",

The pita and tomatoes were the winners of my combo plate, but that's a far cry from a compliment as it's the entirety of the meal I should be touting.   -Gyro meat was too strongly seasoned, overly wet with juices -Chicken was chunky and fatty, not nicely chopped or shredded -White sauce was alright but nothing signaturely fresh and clean -Baklava costs $2.00 for the BITE portion I got...don't get me wrong, I don't mind the portion but TWO DOLLARS for something less than tomorrow gourmet...?! Please!   Service: Lastly, I actually entered the establishment twice and wasn't acknowledged the first time within the 2 minutes I reviewed the menu, so I went to check out another establishment. 30 minutes later I came back and it took, again, over a minute to even be greeted. I will not be back, and unfortunately, given the entire experience, I've got a less than pleasant taste in my mouth for The Halal Guys.",

They are not joking when they say it is hot. Got one tiny squirt on my food and I couldnt even finish. Neither could my companion. In fact I made him stop at the nearest gas station so I could buy a bottle of chocolate milk to make the pain go away.   Completely regret going here but their sauce is nuts. Burns coming out too. If spice is your thing they are worth checking out for the hot sauce. Too bad they don't have anything palatable for you to put it on.",

But to be able to maintain friendly & fast service while serving a consistent platter of meat, rice, sauce, & bread across the country is truly amazing.   Even with a long line in front of you, you'll be served in a timely manner. Order it thru delivery, and it's a nearly identical experience as going to get it yourself.   The chicken is a bit on the bland side.  The beef gyro is nice & zesty.  Pita is soft & tastefully chewy.  Rice is decent & mild on the flavor.  Salad is used to cool it down when you get overzealous with the hot sauce.  White sauce is decent. Bbq sauce makes it better & fun, The Hot sauce is best taken in moderation.   And a side of fries is surprisingly tasty.    I've been to this location about 8 times this month & will continue to enjoy my combo platter any time of the day.",

I really don't like giving poor reviews, but there's no way I can give this more than two stars, purely from a food standpoint.  I used a THG recipe at home once and my version far outshone what I just ate.  I love falafel and I was in the mood for something tasty, so I headed inside the compact storefront and ordered the small falafel bowl, which consists of lettuce, tomato, yellow rice and three generously-sized falafel pieces. The guy on duty asked me if I wanted pita bread (after checking to make sure I wasn't a vegetarian, so I'm not sure what that was about... are they made with lard?) and gave me about half of a pita's worth.  Once my bowl was assembled, I could add extras like onions, jalapenos, green bell peppers, pitted Kalamata olives, hot sauce, and white sauce. I chose the bell peppers, olives, and white sauce. Kudos to the worker for warning me that the hot sauce was \"hotter than 20 jalapenos,\" because otherwise I would've tried it and been in pain! The service was pretty quick and efficient, and the place was clean. I didn't love that half the seating is concrete benches. It looks sleek, I suppose, but sorta gives off a prison vibe and wasn't very comfortable.  I was just completely underwhelmed by the food. There was almost a total lack of flavor. The white sauce lent moisture to the bowl, but nothing more. Perhaps they need a hot sauce that's somewhere between flavorless and burning with the fire of 1,000 suns.  I think I'll try a mom-and-pop for Middle Eastern food next time I'm in the area.",

Let's just speak in emojis   The Chicken and Gyro... so moist, deliciousness bursting in your mouth. Not to mention their special white sauce .

Now, comes the Hummus, the Baklava, the Fries. I get it, not the main menu entry but I don't get how you can make Hummus so simple and bland. The Fries was even the same. Simple and bland. The Baklava - the only dessert they have yet tasted like it was old. I can get a better baklava at a middle eastern store. Dont waste your money buying one! Unless they improve it. As you can see, few other yelpers said the same thing about baklava.  UPDATED:  Wow! I thought there would be an improvement after seeing reviews of how bland, tasting like cardboard and old the BAKLAVA is! But no, its the same piece. Such a waste of my money!

I got a regular combo platter with white sauce, ONE line of hot sauce, a scoop of hummus and some onions.  This place definitely lives up to the hype.  Both the chicken and the beef gyro were well-seasoned and tender. Good flavor on the rice.  That white sauce set set it off, and the one line of hot sauce was all I needed!  The hummus was just as good and fresh as they described it, creamy and lemony.  Everything was pretty tasty, especially when I folded it up in the pita triangles.  I wanna go back and try a sandwich next time, and I heard the falafel's great too.  Next time!",

The long 50 minutes wait in line plus 10 minutes walk from the car on Grand Opening day was all worth it! Both the service and food were great, friendly, quick and tasty. I just wished that they're more generous with the sauce, both white and red sauce, pretty stingy compare to NYC ones. Tried the baklava in NYC, not here but assumed tastes the same, it's way too sweet for my taste. Cannot wait for HG to open one on the West side.",

Second if you're going to drain students trust funds by charging 10 bucks a plate for rabbit food and a small portion of protein. Can u at least spend some money on 2 ply toilet paper.  After I'm done eating said rabbit food I have to expel some waste. Unfortunately my hand was wearing most of my own waste due to cheeping out and having 1 ply.  U have ur business on a college campus with guys who like to eat and usually spend a fair amount of time ingesting garbage.  The make up of said waste will have a thick consistency. So please Nickel and dime owners invest in some upgraded products.    Thanks",

The food can be inconsistent which is why I give it 4 stars. When it's good it's really good and I finish all of it. When it's not good, the meat can be too dry. I think it's better to ask for the white sauce on the side. That way, you're in charge of how much sauce is mixed in. The Pita that they give isn't fresh and warm which is something I don't like.",

    "text": "So I work in Chandler and today I drove 46 minutes to and from The Halal Guys to satisfy my craving, okay? I'm Halal-ed out now though but I'm glad I went. I went for the first time on Friday night and it was everything. I ordered a regular size chicken platter with extra white sauce and a DOLLOP of red sauce. That red sauce is nothing - NOTHING - to play with. My mouth was on fire but it was so good. It's an intense burn but it fades out quickly so I guess that's the silver lining to it being so hot, lol. My husband tried some while we were driving and he almost wrecked the car, he couldn't comprehend how people enjoy it! I also ordered one piece of baklava and a fountain drink. Side note: did you know Fanta made ginger ale? It's a faint ginger flavor but it was great. Also, it was my first time having baklava and it's so good. I was looking up recipes today to try to make it sometime soon. Anyway, I enrolled in the rewards program and when I went today, I got a free drink. If you ever forget to have them add your reward points to your account in store, you can always do it online. I actually preferred my meal more Friday than I did today. I don't know if it's because it was later at night and maybe the chicken had been marinating longer but I just felt like it had more flavor. I asked for extra white sauce but it wasn't nearly enough because 34 of the way through my platter, it was pretty dry. And of course, it isn't the same as the authentic NY Halal Guys but it's worth the 45 minute drive from my apartment in Arizona!",

We visited Halal Guys on Saturday for lunch and as predicted there was a line out the door.  It took about 30 minutes for us to order our food.  We ordered 2 gyro and 2 combination sandwiches.  We sadly were disappointed as the sandwiches contained barely any meet (not flavorful) and mostly lettuce.  They were also completely cold inside. I can't even compare the gyro sandwich to local Greek shops in the Scottsdale/Tempe area, as this was not like the gyros i have previously eaten at Halal Guys.  I hope this changes!  I don't mind paying more, but they need to get the recipe and quantity to be closer to the original if they want to compete in this market or use the Halal Guys name.",

The pita bread is very good but that was about the only positive we could come up with. We ended up going elsewhere later that night to get food that was remotely satisfying.

The portion of chicken and beef was really small so I was left with undercooked rice and an ton of lettuce. The best part of the meal was the white sauce which was what made this meal edible. However I will warn you the hot sauce is HOT. I'm someone who eats hot sauce on everything and this sauce Is almost unbearable, good but really spicy!

    "text": "My initial visit to The Halal Guys had me impressed and hungry for more. I was excited to indulge in their food and welcomed The Halal Guys as a potential competitor to Chipotle in the Tempe-ASU area.   On my first visit, the lines were out the door, which left me feeling both excited for the food and irritated because I had to wait. After reaching the entrance and getting past the bouncer, I approached the friendly staff at the counter and asked for a combo plate. I glanced at the menu and looked around the store, but had to double take at the menu one more time to make sure I read the right prices. 8.99$ for a regular platter. When making my decision, I looked at the man in front of me, who opted for the costly 6.99$ wrap, and noticed his sandwich was much smaller than the menu image made it out to be. Assured that I had made the right choice, I proceeded to walk along the counter, mesmerized by the teamwork and mass production of food by the staff. The employee added two heaping spoonfuls of rice which I oddly assumed was cheese, a scoop of crunchy water (lettuce), a scoop of flavorless tomatoes, a pitiful spoonful of gyro, a lackluster spoonful of beef, and 4 mini triangular pieces of pita bread. Unbeknownst to me, you are allowed to add onions, green onions, and olives as free extras, however I was uninformed of this by the busy staff. The employee then asked me if I would like white sauce, red sauce, or barbecue sauce but I asked for all three on the side (to get more quantity). To finish it all off, the staff placed my to-go meal in a high quality yellow Halal Guys plastic bag, which felt silky smooth and amazing to touch.  When I reached home, I was eager to try the food. I opened the legendary white sauce and drizzled it over my food. SO MUCH WHITE SAUCE. I sampled the rice alone and found it excessively greasy, but satisfying. The crunchy water and flavorless tomatoes added meaningless bulk to the meal. Both of the meats, gyro and beef, tasted average and were not horrible, but were not amazing either. The flavor particularly came from the white sauce and red sauce. The legendary white sauce was creamy and delicious, tasting like ranch dressing but with less kick. However, spoon after spoon of creamy, fattening white sauce with the greasy orange rice had my taste buds begging for something new. I drizzled the red sauce over the platter and was in for a surprise. This sauce was made for Satan himself. While not adding spicy flavor to the meal, the sauce tasted extremely hot and added excitement and variety to the greasy repetitive nature of the meal. The mini pita pieces were soft and delicious (I would recommend adding an extra pita for a dollar).   After return visits to the restaurant, I have found the food tasting dull, greasy, and flavorless, even in spite of adding the optional extras and trying their hummus. I also observed a decline in the quality of service they provide. On one visit, two of the employees looked stoned (which I do not mind), but they forgot to include my white and red sauce on the side in the bag, the very essence of Halal Guys. On two other visits, I was charged different amounts for the same combination platter I usually get. The staff is not as friendly as they initially were, and the overall food quality has declined from its initial opening. I would not expect more from a fast food restaurant but I was hoping for more.  Despite my critique of the store, I was initially astonished and satisfied by the food. For 8.99$, the quantity of food is decent and Halal Guys offers a fresh take on fast food in the Tempe-ASU area. Additionally, the hours are great, midnight on most days and 4AM on Saturday.",
