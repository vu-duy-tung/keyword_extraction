Yupha's is tucked back in a strip mall and is very warmly decorated. The service was good and there was quite a good crowd coming and leaving while we were there. We had the golden crisp puffs to start which I am a huge fan of, and we both had red curry - chicken and beef. I had the beef thai hot and for someone who likes spice, it wasn't too hot but it did have a kick and was very flavorful. It was my guest's first time having Thai and he described it as \"excellent\". I would definitely recommend and return if I am back in the area.",

I had the Papaya Salad hot and it was so delicious--I like to get HOT not Thai Hot, but 'hot' so that I can feel all the flavors tingle my lips.  We also ordered the drunken noodles and they were OK with substituting out bell pepper for broccoli.  And my friend ordered a soup with a soothing coconut base, just delicious!    I am a fan!!  I do not live in Phoenix, but I will be sure to frequent this restaurant when I am back in the Valley of the Sun for super yummy Thai food!!  Thank you!! :)",

They told me that since it was a Sunday, we had to go to Yupha's since Yupha had great Sunday Specials [or great lunch specials in general].  One of the perks of having gone the day that we did was that their soup and their salad for lunch were all you can you eat [or at least they didn't hint at any restrictions - I still only went for one round]. What was great about the salad is their peanut sauce/dressing - SOOOO DELICIOUS!!  I got their chicken red curry, one friend got their chicken green curry, and another got their duck red curry. All of the dishes were of generous portions and extremely flavorful. The texture in the chicken was not tough and not overdone as it often can be in curries. There were ample ingredients in the curry to complement the rice. I was extremely satisfied with my selection, and from the looks of the empty plates from my friends, they were extremely happy with their selections as well.  The service was really nice, although one of the servers were not as proficient in his English and misunderstood a few of the things that were said. The staff all made us feel very welcome, making this place an absolute consideration to dine at the next time I'm in the area [I'm from Cali..]  If you want ample portions, good flavor, good pricing, and a friendly service, Yupha will NOT disappoint.",

Plus, over half the items on the plate were not meant to be eaten, just for decoration. Looks like a lot of food, but it really isn't. Maybe I was just really hungry. The staff sucked. I've heard from numerous other people (who love and still frequent this place, despite their staff) that Yupha's has the best food, just horrible service when the owner, Yupha, isn't there. It took forever to be seated, when we (party of two) could see actual tables open just sitting there.   Second visit was a complete and utter disaster. I thought, oh, I'll try take out since I'm by my self and everyone says that's the way to do it anyway. I ordered the Pad Thai for dinner, not realizing that I was looking at the lunch menu. Who would think their lunch pad thai and their dinner pad thai would be different? Well, they are. I'm a vegetarian, and the lunch pad thai has tofu, no meat. Well, the dinner pad thai that I paid $13 for and got home with, had chicken and shrimp in it. I called to see if they could cook me a new meal if I came back (which was already irritating considering I live 15 minutes away. 15 minutes there, 15 minutes waiting, 15 minutes home, 15 minutes back, 15 minutes waiting,15 minutes home... This better be the best pad thai I've ever had.) But instead, after explaining the situation, the lady copped a major attitude with me and said, \"Ok, so?\" I explained again: I'm a vegetarian, I don't eat meat. What I have here has meat, so I can't eat it.\" Her reply: \"Yeah, we have options without meat. And?\"   I cried. I paid $17 dollars after everything was said and done for something I couldn't eat. I will take my business somewhere that understands what good customer service is.  By the way: I've worked 3 years in the restaurant business and the last year I have been in retail, so I have extensive customer service experience. You should NEVER treat someone like that.",

The number of times I've been there for lunch it was packed. Lunch seems to be the better deal. You get more for the money. Dinner is more expensive and it seems like you get a little less. I think it's because the lunch specials come with a spring roll, soup, and salad. (Soup and salad is all you can eat....as long as they don't run out.) Other Thai restaurants I've eaten at skimp on the meat. Not Yupha's. It's not like they pile on the meat, but you can actually find meat. The Thai dishes are amazing and fairly authentic. Be forewarned that if you order dishes extra hot, you'll not be able to taste anything else after the first dish. The servers are very friendly and provide good service.

We walked in, since there was still people there and they had no problem seating us, a great start. We ordered Buddha delight, and crab puff to start. Both of these were amazing. For the main course we ordered tom yum goong, which is a delicious and spicy soup (if you can't take the heat i suggest you go with mild.) After our soup we asked the waiter if we could have the fried banana and the flambed fried ice cream. She said she would ask to the chef's since it was already quite late, which was understandable. To our surprise the chef's said, no problem. The deserts were fantastic ! I will definitely be back !

    "text": "We had great experiences here several times, but our last experience was one that we won't be coming back.  We arrived around 9:30, when they close at 10.  Which most places means they seat until 10.  They seemed annoyed that we were there that late, reminding us of when they close right away.  The dish that I usually got and thought was the best I had ever had at a Thai restaurant, was suddenly the worst.  There was hardly any meat and instead of putting brocoli in it, it was littered with little stubs from the stalks.  It was basically a plate of few noodles and tons of little brocoli stems.  When they saw I didn't like it and I told them why, they just brushed it off and didn't do anything to resolve the issue.  Too bad, I really liked the place and had been there at least 10 times, and now never again.  Mostly because of how they didn't resolve my compliant.  There are other Thai restaurants, so long!",

    "text": "It took me a while to write this review. Yupha's already had so many reviews I figured it didn't need another one. But after almost 70 reviews, I think it should have higher than a 4. This has been my favorite Thai restaurant for 2 years running now, and every now and again I try other Thai restaurants that just aren't as good. Yupha's is exceptional. It is exceptional compared with other Thai places in the Phoenix area, and it is exceptional in comparison to Thai places I've tried in other cities, too. Their Pad Thai beats any other I've tried, and they offer fancier dishes that are always incredible: things like shrimp and eggplant, duck, and lamb. The curry puff appetizer is to die for, and they have lots of tasty salads that are fun to share. I usually pass on dessert when I eat out, but Yupha's offers really tasty, subtle desserts in reasonable portions: sweet sticky rice, rose-scented custard, and homemade coconut ice cream are all amazing. There are other good Thai restaurants in town, and you should support those, too, if you like them, but Yupha's is truly incredible, and if you've been meaning to give it a try, do.",

We had a noodle dish with beef and an entree with chicken and shrimp. Nice portion sizes. I like Jasmine rice. \"Medium\" spice was really very mild. There were red peppers in evidence in the sauce. But, if you want to feel a burn, medium won't do it. There chili sauce had a lot of interesting flavor to it. It wasn't just hot to be hot (and it wasn't all that hot, either).  \"American\" iced tea: yeah, skip this one. Barely better than Lipton. The Thai iced tea was very rich.  Coconut ice cream with taro root for dessert. The ice cream was OK. The taro was delicious.  Service was polite and competent but on the slow side.  Would definitely go back.",

It's very clean, unlike a lot of other Thai places. The server was very friendly and refilled our waters several times.  I had the red curry. They brought it out very quickly, which was nice during lunch since we had a limited amount of time. It was a huge portion for the price. The chicken was lean and had no gristle. The veggies were clearly fresh as well as the curry sauce. It had a great kick to it, which I love. The sticky rice was great, as well as the egg roll. When you order an entree, you get unlimited trips to their salad bar and soup.  Overall, this place was great.",

I love my stir fry to have a lot of extra sauce for my rice and they nailed it! The tofu is a firm consistency and isn't too soft or too chewy.   The Drunken Noodles were great too. The veggies used are fresh and have a good crunch to them.   The Thai tea was amazing!! It wasn't too sweet and still had strong tea taste to it.   I love love love spicy food. Medium wasn't very spicy at all. I should've gotten the HOT level for my pad pak. HOT level on my drunken noodles was perfect.   Service -   The service however, was subpar. It was quite busy when we went but we were seated within 10 minutes. Once we sat down, we ordered our drinks and food. After that, we did not see the waitress until she dropped off the curry puffs. The couple next to us who sat down about 20 minutes after us got their food at the same time we got ours. Once we got our food, I had to keep looking around to wave someone down for chili paste. They were never rude, just not very attentive.",

It was a touch less spicy than Rama, which could be better or worse depending on who you are. It seems like other reviewers have reported slightly more mild flavors too, so there may be something to that. They also served far less rice than Rama. While they will bring you more rice... Rama will bring you a large bowl and repeatedly ask if you want more. Total rice in the original bowl was about 1 cup. Which maybe I don't know how to properly eat thai, but that is far enough for a whole meal of curry.  I also got the crab puffs, which were freaking awesome.  I went with a vegetarian and they felt that their options were limited. If you are a vegetarian and don't want tofu (like my company) then you can ask for more vegetables in place of the tofu if you want.  I'd go back here no problem. I liked it.  Note: beware of having a group of 5 or more. That will warrant an automatic tip added to your bill.",

I am giving them a 4 star because the Crispy Spring rolls were not good and their drunken noodles could have been better( my wife orders only this item in all the Thai restaurants we have been to). I have had GOOD crispy spring rolls only in very few Thai restaurants. Most of them taste obvious that they use frozen spring rolls. I am not sure about what these guys used but it was not that great.",

    "text": "I had family in town and we were craving some good Thai food. This was in so many ways an awful experience for our party of 4 and very embarrassing since we were trying to show our family a good time and enjoy a nice dinner. First off, when we came in we asked if we could have a booth but the server said they had none and took us to a table. As we sat down we noticed a booth was indeed available across the way but another party was sat there just a minute later and we didn't have time to ask if we could move. OK no biggie. 2nd, it took FOREVER for someone to come to the table, once they did they simply said are you ready? Really? No apology, no introduction to who you are or a welcome? Nope, none of that. OK fine, of course we already knew what we were having since we had forever to look at the menu. Our food came about 30min later and it was good BUT no one ever came to check on us to see how everything was, if we needed anything (which we did). Fast forward to the lovely way our meal ended. We asked for boxes and they came with boxes and a check. We were going to ask for their dessert menu but I guess at 9:30pm on a Friday evening they were already getting ready to leave. It truly felt like they wanted us out, everyone out so the staff could go home. We saw kitchen staff hanging out in the dining room looking around as we were chatting, obviously they wanted us out. Now let me explain, I've got a background in restaurants over a decade of experience. I would not sit around for hours after closing while staff is waiting on us. I'm telling you it was 9:30pm, there was a party of 8 right next to us still dining and another couple of tables. They all stared us down. Needless to say, no dessert and we paid the check. Also, I almost forgot to mention how the staff was mopping with Fabuloso (I know the smell very well) while we were eating our meal. Not once we were done, but while we were still eating. Do you know that it's not the best idea to clean with chemicals while your guests are still dining? I will not give this restaurant another chance. They had many chances and missed every opportunity to make things right. We did not enjoy our dinner and there are simply too many other options all over Phoenix & Tempe to have good Thai food with great service. I rarely give out 1-2 star ratings but this one was well deserved. If you go, hopefully you have a better experience than we did.",

    "text": "Bad service leaves a bad after taste, and I won't be coming back for more.   First time I ate here I loved it. The Pad Thai was yummy, the ambiance was nice, and it was perfectly placed next to Tempe Cinemas making a great go to for a date night...or so I thought.   Second visit was about 30 minutes prior to closing. In most restaurants that's not a huge deal, but here it means they will ask you for your order before even getting to look at the menu, remind you every ten minutes that they're closing soon, and pretty much stare you down until you're uncomfortable enough that you can no longer enjoy your meal, ensuring that you don't leave a single minute past closing. Fine, they don't like to work late. Noted.   Fast forward a few months for a stop in at lunch. Doors locked. Seems we're 15 min. early this time. No big deal, we'll wait. As we wait we see the same woman who was so rude before. The same woman who is always there. She clearly sees us but doesn't open the door...not until exactly 11:01 that is. You would think she would open the door we were standing at, but nope. First she opened the door on the opposite end, then stopped to answer the phone, then merely unlocked the door we're standing in front of and walked away as if nobody was standing there. Not a smile, not a hello, not a thanks for waiting. Nothing.   I thought maybe she recognized us from before and this was an isolated incident but I've now read other reviews stating the same. Perhaps all the positive feedback has gone to her head to the point that good service has become irrelevant? Maybe it's just as simple as her not wanting to work a minute extra? I dunno. What I do know is that part of what makes a dining experience worthwhile (at least for me) is the service. Food with attitude doesn't taste nearly as good, and I'll gladly go to one of the other ten Thai restaurants in the area the next time I get a craving.",

I ordered Tom Yum Gai (coconut milk soup) and Thai Fried Rice, my friend ordered duck (can't remember which one). I had chicken in the rice and tofu in the soup as I wasn't sure what kind of tofu it was (PF Chang's uses one that has a terrible texture). I loved the tofu, next time I'll get it in my main dish. The chicken was good, not the stark white skinny rubbery pieces found in mixed dishes. I was surprised at how delicious my food was, the flavor of the rice dish and the soup. My friend said the duck was fantastic. The servers were very attentive, filling our drinks often, and very friendly. The bathroom was clean. Great experience.",

    "text": "I love Yupha's!  The bottom line: great Thai food at reasonable prices with excellent customer service.  I've been here two or three times in the last couple of months for dinner with one of my best friends.  The last time I went here our server recognized us and said, \"I recognize you!  You guys come here often!\"  This place is always busy, so it was incredible that our server recognized us as quickly as she did.  Perhaps it's the strangeness of our order - I generally order things just under Thai hot, and she orders things with no spice at all.  I generally order the Pad Thai with an appetizer (often their spring rolls).  They're very conscious of dietary restrictions:  I order my dish with tofu, and they always ask me if egg is okay.  I love that they do that.  I've always found their spice level to be spot-on.  My dishes have the right amount of heat, and my friend never complains about anything being too spicy.  I really appreciate that they trust me when I order my dish hot, but I've also seen them bring out jars of chili flakes and chili oil to patrons who are requesting something a bit spicier.  The portions are perfectly scaled.  If I'm ravenously hungry, I can eat the whole plate without feeling overly full.  If my hunger is at normal levels, I can eat about half the plate and will end up taking the rest home as leftovers.  This place is always busy for dinner, but I've never had to wait to get a table.  The restaurant is spacious and extremely clean.  I never feel like I have to wait long for anything - drinks, someone to take our order, food, or the check.  There are a lot of decent Thai restaurants in Phoenix, but this one is a gem.  If you're craving Thai, come to Yupha's!",

Once you walk inside, you already feel welcome; not only by the friendly staff, but also by the comfortable atmosphere and fun, brightly colored walls.   Both my husband and I enjoy spicy food, however we were unsure just how hot, ordering \"spicy\" really was. So the server was kind enough to suggest we just order medium and she brought over the lovely trio of amazing sauces/spices so we could adjust our meals accordingly.   We started with the Siam Lettuce Wraps which consisted of minced chicken sauteed with lemon grass, galanga & crushed peanuts in brown sauce and served with two sauces on the side. Holy WOW, best lettuce wrap in the world. Period. Forgot the other places you have ordered this quintessential appetizer. This is the top of the mountain as far as I am concerned. Definitely worth a taste.   Based on the huge amount of Yelp reviews suggesting the Drunken noodles, we both decided to give them a try. I ordered mine with shrimp and the hubs ordered his with beef.  Drunken noodles are sauteed flat noodles with cabbage, tomato, bell pepper, onion, egg, Thai basil & chili pepper.   The Thai basil, spices and sauce gives this dish a flavor explosion and creates that palate friendly pyramid of sweet/spicy/fresh/tang that makes you say, \"did that really just happen?!\"   Ok, maybe I am being a tad bit over the top, but I am so thrilled to have found a fantastic Thai place with amazing food, comfortable atmosphere and great service. I am already planning my return visit!",

This visit was on a Friday night, and we all know going out to dinner on a Friday is gonna be a wait. This place is really popular, so if you don't want to wait go before the dinner rush.   The food and service once we got sat were well worth the wait. This is why we've continued to come back. We always seem to get sat in Clarissa's area. She is so upbeat and genuinely happy to see us. Whenever we have questions she provides with more than enough information to help us make our choice. She's even brought us samples of the sauces used in dishes to see if we'll like them. This is AMAZING customer service.   Here's what we've had that I HIGHLY recommend: 902 (yes, I know it's fried rice, but the flavor is unlike any other typical fried rice I've had) 403,400,306,854.    The only I haven't been too crazy about is the golden curry puffs. I felt they were bland. One out of the many we've had isn't bad.   Can't wait to try more dishes!",

The rating here is including service and etiquette of wait staff. They are certainly not very well trained to handle different situations.  I had taken a friend for that person's birthday, while the food was good, the wait staff kept on asking us strange questions every few minutes. It became evident later that it could have been solved easily as they were closing the register after lunch, and they wanted us to pay ASAP.  Such clarity of communication could not be expected of the wait staff here. It leaves a uncomfortable impression in any customer's mind. While I want to go there for the food, I would discourage about taking anybody there for any special occasion.",

    "text": "This place is amazing! I don't usually venture to Tempe but a date suggested it so I was excited to try it! There aren't many Thai restaurants in the Phoenix area and the ones I used to frequent have been closed for awhile (thaifoon and jax).  The decor is okay (as a designer I'm kind of critical) but as for being in a strip mall, the decor is great!! We went early on a Sunday night so there was no wait. The server we had was sweet and attentive and our food came out very quickly.   I ordered the chicken coconut soup (which I love but haven't had since jax closed). The portion was rather small but perfect for a starter. I ate every drop and still had plenty of room for my entree (and usually I get stuffed pretty quickly). It was really flavorful with big chunks of chicken.   Then for an entree I got the yupha's fried rice with chicken because of the rave reviews on here from other yelpers. I concur - the best fried rice ever!!! I will be craving it!! Love that it had the pineapple and cashews and nice big chunks of good quality chicken. A little heavy on the onions for me but I just picked them out. Again, AMAZING!  Both the soup and fried rice I ordered as MILD and they were that - just a tiny bit spicy. I was scared to order MEDIUM but I like a little more kick so I'll try it next time.   My date didn't want anything for dessert but I had to get something. I asked for the mango sticky rice (which I love) bit they said the mango aren't in season right now - which is fine - I'd rather not be served hard mango chunks and be charged $7 for them! Will have to come back when they're in season. So i ordered my second choice - homemade coconut ice cream over sticky rice. The ice cream was a little hard and icy (probably because they make it) but it was still super yummy with the rice and I ate almost all of it myself (my date doesn't like coconut).  I got the jasmine tea to drink. However, it comes without a strainer so all of the tea leaves pour into your cup! I asked if it was supposed to be like that and she said yes. I just didn't like having to spit out or chew on any stray tea leaf I drank. I noticed if you pour it and let it sit a little bit most of them go to the bottom - but by then it's a little cold.   And I do agree with other yelpers that the prices are a little high for the quantity of food, ambiance and location. Although this won't stop me from returning.   So I didn't give four stars because of ambiance, tea and prices. But, I will be back and highly recommend it if you're craving Thai food!!",

We tip on the overall experience/attentiveness.  Our food has been consistently good/great over the 20+ times we've eaten here - take out or dine in.   A friend of ours who vacationed in Thailand more than once and came with us to eat here said the food was very on par in quality with what she ate in Thailand (including home-cooked meals there).

My favorite are the Siam Wrap that I am supposed to share but I can't!! The garlic chicken with vegetables #113 and I even like the dressing of the salad that comes with the meal. They have a wonderful raspberry tea that goes with it all.",

    "text": "Based on the number of 4 and 5 star reviews, I felt that I absolutely had to try this place.  Since switching jobs, now working in the Tempe area I've been on a Thai and Pho binge.  The second Thai restaurant I've tried in Tempe was Yupha's Thai Kitchen.  I decided to dine in.  After being seated, I sat alone for about 13 minutes before the server came to take my order.  I ordered Veggie Drunken Noodles.  She said help yourself to the salad and soup bar.  I did!  I was about 2 spoons in with my soup and my food came out.  It was SUPER quick!  While the server was putting my plate down I got a strong whiff of a fish smell.  He said enjoy and walked off.  I finished my soup and salad and took just one forkful of drunken noodles.  It was disgusting!  Gross!  It tasted like soggy noodles cooked in a pan with fish.  My server never came back.  I got the attention of a hostess, explained why I didn't like my meal and told her I'll just stick with the soul and salad. She explained the price difference in just ordering the soup and salad bar ($8) and a chicken meal ($9.50).  She was right so I decided to try something else.  I asked for a few suggestions. She informed me that the Drunken Noodles are cooked with Thai Basil.  The Thai Basil cause that it's cooked in is fish based.  Who would have thought that?!  The items on the menu that is made with Oyster Sauce or Oyster Oil is indicated on the menu with parenthesis.  I think there should be some sort of indication of the fish content in ALL items, even those with Thai Basil.    I also think when the hostess seats you, they should tell you to help yourself to the soup and salad bar.  Or, the person that brings the water should say something.  Waiting almost 15 minute for the server to take your order and tell you to go to the soup/salad bar is far too long.  I wouldn't return.",

The service is fast, atmosphere calm and mellow, and the most importantly the food is incredible. Their pad Thai, Curry dishes, and soups are all so delicious, and the peanut sauce dressing they offer on their lunch time special salad is a dream. I have visited Yupha's well over 50 times and have never received service or food that was less than impeccable. If I could give above 5 stars I would.",

My favorite items to order are the Thai fried rice with beef, massamun curry, chicken satay, and the chicken Tom Kha soup. It tastes just like the food I had in Thailand while visiting my family there! The only thing I wish they did differently was to have sliced cucumbers in the cucumber salad that accompanies the satay. I dont care for the teeny-tiny diced cucumber, but the flavor is spot-on.",

The staff is very friendly and surprisingly very quick for how full the restaurant was. They have a huge menu which we will have to come back and try the rest.. but we did order the chicken and vegetable gyoza to start which came out very fast and was very good. We then ordered the special which was the beef panang curry with kobasha pumpkin and also the pad woon sen with chicken. They were both the kind of dishes that even though you were full, you couldn't help but keep eating it. Highly recommend this place for  some great Thai food and looking forward to coming back!",

I think large groups start at 8 people for most restaurants.  I did not see anywhere where a party of 5 is a large group.  Now I know never to come here with a group of people.

    "text": "Let me just start out by saying I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place. I've only eaten here twice, but the food is just amazing, if not magical. When I come here, I'm looking to especially treat and spoil myself for all the hard work I've done, (when and if I've done any). Now, I've never been to Thailand, or Asia for that matter. But I've eaten at many Thai restaurants because I love the cuisine, but eating here makes me feel like whoever created this menu, was looking to make it not only special, but something worthy of say a Mother's Day, or a special occasion. A memorable meal to go along with good times.       Of course everyone knows, there are a few ingredients that are a big part of Thai food. Peanuts, which many people are, or think they are, allergic to. If you're one of those, sorry, you are just missing out. Coconut and curry also have major roles. I happen to love all those favors, so this food is like a paradise for me.       The food is plated with care, and presentation is always observed, not just slopped on the plate. The food is delicious, and beautiful. I love the sticky rice and the rice that comes with the meal, it has many absorbing capabilities for the sauces. Also, their heat scale is not hot heavy like some places, and if you ask for a 2, it's a 2. You can always add all the chili oil you want if it's not hot enough, which I did both times.       I didn't know I liked coconut ice cream, but I sure did! It was delicious and was much like normal vanilla except lighter tasting, which I did not expect. I also ordered the sticky rice with it, which I think my sever thought was nuts, maybe a little overkill there but hey! I'm a pro! They also have a flaming fried ice cream dessert for a real special occasion. It looked incredible. I saw one being delivered to a table for a birthday while I was there. I must admit, I felt a little peanut butter and jealous, but I'm not narcissistic enough to order myself one, not even on my birthday.       The only tiny negative, which really isn't, and not really their fault, is that it's in a strip mall, so it's kind of...well...strip mallish. Kind of small, concrete floors, etc. In reality, this place is worthy of its own palace, This is not just the best Thai food I've ever had, but it's also the best fare in the whole area, and I've worked around there for 10 years. It's a tad pricey, but not really when you consider how important it is when you want to really treat yourself. I'm sure, I'll have a craving for this place again sooner or later.",

I have tried countless Thai restaurants from Thai Rama to Latitude Eight to Thai basil and none of them compare to the food and atmosphere of Yupah's.   The prices are standard to Thai but the food is out of this world! You can really taste every single flavor. I tried the tom Kai gai coconut soup and it is by far my favorite. The lemon grass and spices are amazing. Every flavor is present served amazingly. The service is incredible as well. Everyone is extremely friendly. The red curry is without a doubt the best food on the menu. I absolutely love it.   Definitely go here. No other place compares! I love Yupah's!",

I was elated to see they had beef and pork Thai style jerky on their menu.  Folks, this is the real deal...it might sound weird but it is amazingly good....just as good as the street food I used to get at the Thai Buddhist Temple's Sunday Markets.  It brought tears of joy to my eyes.  I will drive the two hours to Tempe any day for this dish!  The inside of this place is unlike any other Thai restaurant is no small, dingy, typical hole in the wall kind of place.  It is hip, modern and elegant (in a relaxed, non intrusive way).  The plates are white and square...the placemats are bamboo like...they even plate the food!    The beef jerky was cooked perfectly!  The sauce was dazzling- it is like a Thai waterfall sauce with lovely notes of lime and chili.  The sticky rice was presented in a banana leaf....the papaya salad was great and you could tell, they made it with a mortar and pastel-the proper way.    I also tried the Thai Toast, which was a special of the day...it was not much to write home about.  Minced chicken inside of panko crusted fried bread.  The sweet chili peanut dipping sauce was quite good.  One diner stole the show, when his dish arrived wrapped in tin foil that was shaped like a swan...I am guessing it must have been the duck (they have duck served 4 different ways here)...yes, it is cheesy....but kinda cool at the same time.  I saw at least 4 tables ask their servers, what he was having.  I wish more places offered Thai style jerky!  Now if I could just get some mee krob on the menu, I would be in total nirvana.   No room left for desert, but they had some nice offerings for sure...I rarely can turn down a Thai style fried banana with the tasty sesame seeds in the batter.....yuuuuummm.",

Also the \"cucumber\" salad was 75% red onion, and 25% cucumber, without any vinegar bite.

    "text": "With so many Thai options in the Valley, this place really does stand out. The variety I think is what sets Yupha's apart from your everyday Thai restaurant.   The ambiance is fitting, and the dining area is very clean and elegantly decorated. All of the times we have eaten here, the service has been very attentive and accommodating. Even the owner is there in the dining room greeting guests on most occasions.The wait staff knows their food and is willing to explain the dishes and substitute ingredients where may be necessary for you.  I really love how they have monthly specials for lunch and dinner. It really makes for an experience that doesn't get mundane; although with their vast menu it would take quite some time for the food to get boring here.  The sampler appetizer is a great place to start to get an idea of the variety they have. Along with a piping hot bowl of soup, your appetite is going to be begging for your entree. Everything from the nutty Pad Thai to the super savory Massaman curry to the endless entrees (try the eggplant basil for something you won't find anywhere else), there is something here for everyone. Specify your level of spice, and enjoy a fresh-made entree that is sure to leave you wanting to come back.  The portions are nice and large; enough for two meals if you have the will power to stop halfway. Sure, the prices are a little higher than what you may find at another Thai place, but one meal here and you'll see the quality of the ingredients and the care that goes into preparing each dish is a cut above the rest.",

Normal price at other restaurants ranges between $8.50-$10. They don't even have meatball or vegetables (celery, string beans, etc) like traditional Thai Boat noodle would include. Also, they barely give you any bean sprouts. Beware on asking for more because they will charge you $1 for a side of bean sprouts. I can get an entire bag at the grocery store for $1. Never will I come here again for their Thai boat noodle.   On a better note, they do have a good and affordable lunch special. I give them credit on that but not the other stuff on their menu.",

I asked her if she wanted to take our drinks order and she allowed as \"oh, yeah, I guess I could do that,\" almost as if it were a strange request.

I have been here now a few times and as I sit here on my lunch break eating leftovers I decided to take a look at the reviews and write my own.  I see a few common complaints in the reviews that I would like to address. The first is the price for the amount. I will agree that the price here is a bit higher than most of the other places to get Thai food I have encountered, and I have gone to many a Thai food place. That said, the few extra dollars a plate is largely offset in my books by how great the food is. I have seen some people say that the portions are less then they expect and I have not experienced that at all.  Another thing that I would mention in regards to the price is the atmosphere. When encountering Thai kitchens I have found it is pretty hit or miss how nice they are on the inside. Several places I have been to I would only ever order take out from rather than sitting in the rundown or dirty restaurant with less than ideal service. Yupha's is where I go when I want to sit down and have a nice meal with someone. It is clean and nice inside, I took my mother to try Thai food this week here.  I have also had only excellent service the times I have been to Yupha's. Very knowledgeable and friendly servers that have never been short or rude.",

After our server disappeared we tried to get the attention of the nearest person to ask for the check, I said \"excuse me-\" and she cuts me off by yelling \"TELL YOUR SERVER!\" And walks the other way. I understand that she wasn't the server, I just needed assistance because ours went missing. She didn't have to be so rude. The decor of the restaurant was okay. The metal tables were dirty looking and uninviting. They didn't look like they have ever been cleaned. Don't think I'm coming back.",

They brought out our food simultaneously close together without any issues.    I went with the classic Pad Thai dish with shrimp and chicken. It was anything but ordinary.

I said \"Sure\" since I have never experienced Thai before and it was something that I had always wanted to try.  We were greeted right away and seated in a nice booth by the Window.  I ordered the Gaeng Kua Sapparod with Shrimp which is what Yupha's recommended. This dish is red curry simmered in coconut milk, pineapple & lime leaves. I chose the \"Medium\" spice level as things that are too spicy can wreak havoc with my digestive system. The sweetness of the coconut milk and pineapple blended with the spiciness of the red curry produced the most amazing meal.  My Brother ordered the Tom Kha Soup with Pork and the Pad Thai with Shrimp, Calamari and Scallops for his main course both with the \"Hot\" spice level since he enjoys more \"heat\" than I do ;). He was extremely pleased with both of his choices.  To finish off, we shared the Coconut Ice Cream. It was deliciously creamy and the perfect way to end our meals.   I will be holding all Thai restaurants that I may visit in the future to the standards of Yupha's.",

I really love Thai food so I think most places are great but Yupha's is definitely worth checking out over some of their competition.   At first I was a bit worried because it is kind of tucked away in a strip mall so I was expecting business to be slow. Both times I have been in for lunch it has been very crowded. I have tried their red curry and pad Thai and both were very good.   Only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because after getting our food I didn't see our server again until we got our check. I am not someone that wants to be constantly approached by the staff but a simple \"is there anything else you need?\" Or \"how is everything\" would make up that little difference. I ordered my food Thai hot and ran out of water. It would have been nice to have had someone check in and refill our carafe.  All in all the place is great and I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Yupha's recently moved east on Elliot, they are now right next to Tempe Cinemas.  Anyone say dinner & a movie?  We had 2 appetizers, one good one merely average.  The Chicken Satay was particularly good with tender and juicy chicken that had a very nice yellow curry aroma and flavor.  The other appetizer was Little Mermaid which is shrimp and bacon wrapped in spring roll skin.  It was not nearly as flavorful as I expected.  The main dishes we shared were Pad Thai and Panang Curry.  The Pad Thai was particularly nice with fresh and distinctive flavors.  We ordered the Panang Curry with chicken and beef and we ordered it mild so that the kids would try it.  It had a bite, but not nearly enough to bring out a sweaty brow-so pretty mild.  It was very heavy on coconut milk flavor and the curry was nice but it could have used a bit more complexity.  There were an abundance of string beans which were hardly cooked at all-too crisp.  I think they were just tossed in at the last second.  There were just a few sections of red pepper and a couple of lime leaves.  The service here was very good.  We had 4-5 people checking on us regularly and my water only went empty once.  I drink copious amounts of water, so that is pretty good.  The atmosphere was nice and open with a very clean and modern take on a Thai restaurant-I approve.",

    "text": "Definitely a great place to go if you like Thai food or would like to try it for the first time. The ambiance is casual, inviting and fun. I like that their decor is tasteful and not overly frilly.  The wait staff is friendly, when they are available. I have to say, this place is not where you'd go for a \"quick bite\". Even for lunch, expect to be there at least an hour. It's usually very packed.   Price-wise, it's not overly expensive here, but it's definitely not a cheap Thai joint either. If you go for lunch, the lunch menu ranges from $5.99 (just Soup & Salad) to Seafood dishes at $12.99. If you order lunch, you get free self-serve soup & salad. I really enjoy the hot peanut sauce for the salad and the soup is very light. It may throw some people off that the soup is rather bland but it's an appetizer. I'm sure if it's too tasty, people would just keep helping themselves to the complimentary Soup & Salad bar.   Some of my favorite dishes are: Pad See Ew (usually with beef), Chicken Pad Thai & the Yupha's Fried Rice. Their curry dishes are also YuMmMMmy!!! I really need to try other things since I keep alternating between those. I always wondered why their food tastes sooo good then realized it's because they tend to make their food a bit sweeter than some places. I'm not complaining since I have a sweet tooth! The only disappointment I ever experienced here was their Seafood soup. I've had really good Seafood soup elsewhere and was sure this place would rock.. only to be so let down. Their broth was extremely limey and sour, lacking any other flavors. Thankfully I only ordered a small bowl of it and not a huge one. Aside from that, everything I've had there is fantastic!   For dessert, I've had their sticky rice with mango which was delicious since the mango was in season. I'd really like to try their Homemade coconut ice cream next time I go! I love that stuff!  Aside from the slow service and their nasty Seafood soup, I really love this place!",

Yupha's has a great atmosphere, I will never tire of staring at that beautiful green painting with the boats- which is lucky since a new boat themed Yupha's painting has been added to the back wall :) The staff is super sweet- they always remember mine and my boyfriend's order when we come in- and often tease me about my aversion to spices, haha! As for Yupha herself- she is kinda like the queen of Thai food here in phoenix but, that is just my opinion ;)  My favorite dishes are the Pad Thai and Pad Woo Sen- but seriously, it is all amazing!",

Bacon wrapped shrimp wrapped in a spring roll cover, it's amazing.  I can't remember the name of my entree, but it was number 303 on the menu, a garlic dish with shrimp, the best choice for me since I love both garlic and shrimp.  For a drink I chose the jasmine hot tea.  To be honest it wasn't the best choice.  Otherwise the whole experience was great.  We tried a few desserts, the mango one was good, the hot and cold combo was interesting.  The coconut and Thai tea icecream was good, I'm not a fan of coconut but everyone else enjoyed it.  My favorite was the fried Icecream.  Vanilla icecream breaded, frozen then fried, and flambeed at the table with rum.  Some honey was drizzled over it, I'm not a fan of honey either but I loved the dish so much it didn't matter.  One of them best Asian food places ever.",

The busser vmbrought water immediately but then we waited a good 5-10 min for our server to approach and when she did, she just said, \"do you want a drink and are you ready to order\"? Well, yeah but we also want apps and have questions. We got the fried tofu which was fantastic and the veggie platter which was not. 3 small spring rolls, 2 fried tofu and 2 grilled tofu sticks with about a teaspoon of peanut sauce. We asked for more and bam! $3.00! So dumb to charge people for sauces that come with it anyways. Sis had Pad Ew and it was delicious and my other sis had chicken and veggies in an oyster sauce which was bland. Mom and neice and I all did pad thai, nothing to write home about. They added an %18 gratuity for 5, so watch out for that. Server was just kinda bitchy, not nice, not mean, just.....bitchy. No need to come here with Thaiger around the corner.",

Service was very slow, but, there did not seem to be a reason for that. I ordered and a salad bar or soup comes with the lunch. I chose the soup that you get yourself, it was not that good. But, before I did that ,I had gone in to the bathroom to wash my hands. It was not very clean. Soup was plain, and the lunch was good. But, the staff all sat down to have their lunch  as well. Which meant they were not attentive to the customers. There was about 5 tables in there. But, why not wait until your luch service is over. THey close for lunch at 2:30. I just found that to be in poor taste to sit down to eat,in the middle of your lunch service while you are still waiting on people. Not too impressed with this place any more.",

    "text": "I was craving Tom Kha Gai today and Mr. Dubs had been scoping this place out for months.  What better time than to do a little take-out to go with my Ghost Adventures marathon?    So I went to call in my order and the nicest lady picked up.  After a few questions, I placed my order of: The Sampler, Massaman in Pineapple Boat with Scallops, Pad King Sod with Calamari, a bowl of Tom Kha Gai, and a bowl of Seafood Soup.  Here's the breakdown:  - Sampler ($12):  You get two Thai rolls, two golden curry pastries, six buddha's delight, and six kew krob.  The Thai rolls are your standard little spring rolls with nothing too remarkable, the buddha's delight is your typical fried tofu, the kew krob had an interesting medley of ground chicken and spices, but my favorite were the curry pastries.  Puff pastry with curry chicken, onion, and carrots?  Yes please!  I think I would skip on the sampler if I come back and just order the curry pastries.    - Massaman in Pineapple Boat ($16 + $3 for scallops):  Advertised on their site as a Mother's Day weekend special, I decided to order this because I love massaman curry and the added pineapples intrigued me.  While I think the $3 up-charge for like four scallops (cut in half) was a bit much, I enjoyed this dish!  The pineapple really adds a brightness to the otherwise heavy dish.  They even threw in the pineapple boat... which ended up getting tossed after I kept spilling curry all over the place.    - Pad King Sod with Calamari ($13):  Squid stir-fry with ginger, onions, mushrooms, and bell peppers in its simplest form.  I was hoping for a balanced dish but all I got was an overwhelming garlic flavor.  I love garlic but whoa!  It was a bit much.  - Tom Kha Gai & Seafood Soup ($4 & $6):  The Tom Kha Gai here is delicious!  It might've been the blinding craving for coconut milk soup but this stuff hit the spot.  It was silky and coats the mouth!  The chicken was a bit dry but what can you do about white meat chicken really?  The Seafood Soup was mainly eaten by Mr. Dubs.  It tasted of your standard hot & sour soup with lots of lime.  The seafood soup was definitely not my favorite.  The decor was lovely and I almost wished I dined-in instead of carried out.  The service was friendly but for $61, I was hoping for a little more.  The portions are a bit small and they're pretty stingy on the seafood but the flavors for most of the dishes were great.",

    "text": "I consider myself an Asian Foodie, but I never came across a Thai restaurant I wanted to go back to.  This is one of them.  I came to eat at Yupha's on a Monday night because my friend chose this restaurant to have her birthday party at with her friends and our Wild Dining MeetUp members.  30 people attended.    I asked the server what items on the menu were considered truly authentic, that REAL Thai people from Thailand would order.  Is this authentic?  Is that authentic?  I told her I didn't wanna eat Whitey-Gringo Thai food.  Finally she said nothing on the menu was truly authentic as would be found in Thailand because we American's couldn't eat it, too spicy.   I agreed with her, told her that I spent 5 weeks in Thailand  in 2011 and just could not eat the food.  Even asking for NOT spicy, was so hot, that all I had was diarrhea.  So I ate only Australian steaks and pizza.  When I came back to the States, I was shocked to see I had lost 12 pounds (119 instead of 131).  I thought something was wrong with the scale.    I love duck so I chose Ped Gra Prow, $18.00   It said Crispy Skin on the menu.  Crispy roast duck over onions, bell peppers, Thai basil & chili pepper.  The server said it had crispy skin, and I love duck with crispy skin.  I ordered it for the \"skin\".  The girl next to me ordered the same thing.  Her order came first and I commented that the skin did not look crispy at all!   It was coated with a dark soy-looking sauce, \"glistening\" on it.   She poked at it, NOT crispy.   I called the server and she said it wouldn't be crispy because they put a sauce on it.  Do I want it without the sauce?   I said yes.  Well as soon as I said Yes, the dish came out of the kitchen and it was \"too late\".    The sauce was good (given rice was insufficient to eat the sauce with, like other reviewers said), but the duck, two legs of dark meat (I prefer dark meat) and some small additional pieces were so overcooked, hard and dry, that parts of it were like old jerky, and I had to spit it out (like eating bark).  When I told the birthday girl, after we all left the restaurant and went home, she said I should have sent the duck back.  Yes, trying to eat the leftovers, so hard and dry, tasting like vulcanized liver,  I should have sent it back, but the restaurant was so busy serving 30 people and their different orders.  I find it really hard to pull the meat off the bone, so tough the duck is.  I did tell the manager the duck was so hard and dry, when I left the restaurant, but I also commended them many times for their good service.  I tasted other people's orders such as Pad Thai, but nothing tasted good enough to come back here.  I am giving it 2 stars because I felt the service was not lacking like the duck was.  They handled 30 people very well and the food came out relatively quickly, without mistakes.  Otherwise I'd give it one star if service was lacking or rude (like Yelpers know Chinese restaurants are famous for), and food was bad too.    The thing I liked the most about the dinner was the Costco chocolate cake that the birthday girl bought for us.  I ate two pieces!   Yum !",

    "text": "I've been here so many times and I keep coming back, I don't know why I haven't written a review yet!  The atmosphere at night is pretty dim and nice. The servers are always so sweet and will answer any questions you have about the foods on the menu. I believe it is family owned (don't quote me!)  They do close for a few hours; closed from 3pm and reopens at 5pm (before they close would be considered lunch and after would be considered dinner). With lunch, you will get a slightly smaller portion but with that- free salad and soup. Ugh, don't get me started on the AMAZING peanuty-like dressing for the salad, IT IS SO GOOD.   I ALWAYS get the Chicken Pad Thai and Beef Drunken Noodle. Honestly, I'm not just saying this but every single place I eat Pad Thai and Drunken Noodle with, it's never as good as Yupha's. I always compare my Thai food with this restaurant's because it always comes out SUPER flavorful and bold, no ingredient is ever skimped out on, and the texture of the noodles are great. We occasionally get the Pad Woon Sen which is like a plate of clear noodles (with veggies and all that) that come with a bowl of rice and your choice of protein- that dish is a great neutralizer to all the bold, savory flavors that you're getting with the Drunken Noodle and Pad Thai.  If you're ever not a fan of bold, savory, flavorful kick in EVERY bite, get the Pad Woon Sen to cancel it out.   I have nothing negative to say about this place! Please, please, please give this restaurant a try! Great service, AMAZING food. I definitely come here at LEAST once a month and I will always keep coming back.",

    "text": "There were two big reasons why I was SO impressed with Yupha's.  1) I came in while adhering to a very, very restrictive diet. No salt, no oil, no sugar. I ordered the seafood special and requested it cooked to my restrictions. Not only were they able to steam everything without those add ins (which I was amazed by - AND it tasted great which was a major plus!) but they even asked me if I wanted to sub out their jasmine rice for brown instead. It was awesome that they not only helped me keep my diet going, but even gave healthy alternatives that weren't on the menu.  2) I came in with a group of 25 people. Talk about a major task for a restaurant! They carried off our meal without a hitch, and - get this - gave us each separate checks without us requesting it. I've been with much smaller groups at other restaurants and had this turned down.  Overall, customer service was outstanding. Seriously blown away. I can only vouch so much for the food considering my diet, but I can say that with me taking out all of the most tasty ingredients, it still tasted REALLY great. Everyone's food around me looked phenomenal as well.  I will definitely be back... especially when I am off my diet!",

Also, tofu (fried or soft) is always an option for every lunch dish.

HUGE lunch portions. i could barely finish a third of it and i had a ton to take home for dinner. also if you arent into spicy, i'd definitely go mild. medium spicy is pretty groovin, but i dont think it would work out well for someone who only wants a little spice. yupha's also has an interesting salad bar/soup thing that comes with some of the lunches. check out the salad with the peanut dressing. mmmmmm peanut dressing. i loves it.   service is fast and friendly. take your check up to the front if you want to get out of here quickly. i think yupha's is going to be my work lunch thai place :). garlic beef here i come!",

Don't miss the old location since this was the first time I've been here. :) But it was quite confusing to me since I drove to the old location and just couldn't find it. Luckily my phone can browse the web and I found the new location on their website.  Anyways, the new location looks pretty nice. Nice decor and the lady manning the cashier was very helpful and nice (I'm guessing that's Yupha?). I ordered the Pad Sew Ew lunch special, one of my favorite Thai noodle dishes. I took it to go though, so when I finally got him after about 30 mintues, the fried spring roll was not crisp anymore. I can't complain though and I was more interested in the noodles themselves.  What can I say? It was good, very good in fact. The right mix of soy and spicyness. Other thai restaurants get the spicyness wrong for me. I like my dishes with heat, but I can't take too much of it. And too little makes it bland. This was the correct amount of heat for me. Also, the chicken was cooked properly. Other places sometimes overcook it, making it tough and rubbery. This was still quite moist and tender.  It's a thumbs up for me, but I'll have to come back with a group to order more dishes.",

We eat a lot of Thai in San Francisco, but we have never ate anywhere that had such flavor. This place is definitely my favorite, better than actual Thai restaurants in Thailand! I love the yupha seafood special, perfect flavors. Also the Tom kha gai soup is outstanding, the flavors are insane!! Every curry was perfect and the Pad Thai was so flavorful. Much more flavors here than anywhere. Eat here!!",

Furthermore, we ordered the mango sticky rice dessert. That too was a big disappointment. It was sad when my date stated that she can make better product that Yupha.  Lastly, the service was sub-par when it gets busy. We tried numerous times flagging a helper for addition rice. I think the service is good when it isn't busy.   Although this restaurant is close to my house, I don't think I will visit this place much...unless I crave some green curry....",

After checking yelp and seeing all of the good reviews we decided to give this place a try.  We had our 5 year old daughter with us and I was very surprised to see a kids menu.  Not only that, but when they brought us our water they brought her a small kids cup of water with a lid on it! Very thoughtful and I was quite surprised.  We started with their Thai spring rolls which were delicious and the hubby ordered the much talked about drunken noodles with beef and I had the yellow curry with chicken, \"a little bit spicy.\"  My daughter enjoyed the corn dog and french fries. The hubby loved his drunken noodles and was cautioned by the waitress that they are VERY filling.  She was not exaggerating.  I also found the yellow curry to be quite filling and extremely delicious. If you are in the area and have the hankering for an extremely yummy Thai restaurant you just have to stop at Yupha's.  It was one we will remember and return to again in the near future.",

    "text": "Yupha's Thai Kitchen 1806 E. Elliot Road Tempe, 85284  I have eaten Thai food in many different places both in and outside of Arizona, but this place is either at the top or almost at the top of Thai places to eat.  I was joined by two companions for dinner. I started out with the Thai rolls ($4.95). Beautifully crispy spring rolls served with a nice sweet chili sauce. Companions both agreed that these were really good.  Companion #1 ordered Pad Prik Khing, which was chicken sauteed in house curry paste with string beans, bell peppers and lime leaves. Companion was concerned about how spicy the food might be, but the cook made it to companions order and it was pronounced perfect. Companion completely finished the plate.  Companion #2 ordered Scallop Gra Prow, which was sauteed scallops with onion, bell pepper, Thai basil and Thai chili pepper. Companion liked the food on the spicy side, and the chef was happy to comply. Companion completely finished the plate.  I ordered Ped Khing Sod - crispy roast duck with ginger, mushroom, onion, celery, bell pepper, ground pork and bean sauce. The duck was fresh and cooked to perfection. I loved the sauce, and the veggies were properly crisp and cut into nice, mouth sized portions.  Both companion #1 and I ordered Thai tea, which is almost a necessity for removing the heat if it gets to be too much. I ordered my duck at medium heat, and next time I will order it at the hot level because I didn't find it to be nearly hot enough for me, but then again, it's a matter of individual taste.  About the only thing I didn't really care for was the rice that was served with the dinner. It seemed to be overcooked and not at all like a good rice should be in texture.  We all decided to have dessert. Companion #1 had a concoction of  grapefruit with a coconut macaroon, which was pronounced quite good. Companion #2 had flaming fried ice cream, which was a whole world of difference from what is usually served as fried ice cream in other places. The batter was a totally different but excellent texture, and the waitress lit a cruet of rum on fire at the table and them properly poured it over the fried ice cream. Not only was the presentation nice, but the taste and texture were pronounced excellent. For my dessert I ordered Creme Brulee, which is not usually on the menu but is a special for this month. I've eaten this dessert across the states, and it is usually good, but in this case, it was outstanding. The creme was silky smooth and wonderfully thick with a not too thick layer of burnt sugar on top. It was like a trip to heaven.   The place is nicely clean and the restrooms could be a model for a lot of other places - clean, fresh, and nicely appointed.  This is easily the best Thai restaurant in the valley, and matches or bests other places I've eaten at across the states.  5 stars for quality of food, cleanliness, service and ambiance.",

The spot is intimate and cozy and a great date place, despite its strip mall location. It has pretty artwork on the walls, and it's quiet enough to where it's easy to have a great conversation. The food there is some of the best Thai food I've had, and my companion said he's still dreaming about the meal he had there.  He started off with the Little Mermaid ($5), which is shrimp and bacon wrapped in a spring roll. The faces he was making while eating this said it all: they were great.  For my meal, I went with my favorite Thai dish, the Red Curry ($10.95). I got a medium heat, which was wayyyy too hot for my sensitive palate. I would recommend going with the least amount of heat possible, especially if you're new to Thai food, because the heat always tends to be way hotter than you anticipate.  I got my meal with brown rice, and combining the two was just heavenly. It's one of my favorite meals ever, and because it's mostly vegetables, it's relatively healthy. The service at Yupha's was also really friendly and attentive. If you're in the area, it's definitely worth stopping there for a bite.",

Do they get very busy at lunch?  Yes they do, so if you're hungry, be considerate and be ready to order.  The salad bar is always fresh and the peanut dressing, delicious.  The vegetable consomme is light and flavorful.  Entrees?  From the lunch menu, I've had them all.  The Pad See Ew, noodles in black soy (all entrees choice of pork, chicken, beef, shrimp, tofu) with broccoli and egg is a standout.  As are the drunken noodles, Pad Khing Sod (if you love ginger), and the Pad Prikh King, with bean curd.  You can order any level of heat that you prefer, from mild to triple Thai hot.  Not on the lunch menu, but highly recommended, are any of the duck dishes, which come to your table sizzling (always an attention getter!).  The duck is tender and succulent, never dry or greasy.  My experiences here have been universally wonderful, over many years.  How's that for a review?",

Nothing to it at all. A bowl of soup is $10??  Prices need to be competitive. There are some great thai places around the area that give Yuphas a good competition... especially when prices are more reasonable as well.",

    "text": "Warning. Yupha's likes it hot. Their mild is not so mild.  I'll admit I'm not that into spicy food. Wherever I go for thai food I always order the mild. Usually that means little to no spice. At Yupha's mild means spicy. I ordered the pad pak - mixed veggies with chicken. It was so hot my tongue was burning. So I asked the waitress if I could get it remade and se did accommodate me and told me \"next time order no spice\" will do! But then not 5 minutes later I overheard a guy saying the same thing about his pad thai - too spicy. So at least it's not  just me!  When I got my fresh order it was delicious. A nice mix of veggies and flavorful sauce - just no spice! And the servings are huge! I had plenty left over for another meal.  So if you like spicy food you'll get your fill here. If you don't, remember to order no spice or get ready for your tastebuds to go up in flames.",

It's open, calm and even though it was very busy, it was somewhat quiet.    I ordered the Pad Pak with chicken and a side of fried rice.  I'm really sensitive to spiciness and their \"mild\" has a bit of a kick to it - but not to the point where it's unbearable.  The veggies were cooked to perfection.  My dish was incredibly flavorful.  And that fried rice!  I will be going back there just to order the fried rice!  It's the best I've ever had in my life!  Definitely a great restaurant!

Warm, welcoming and patient staff assisted us as we asked 1000 questions about the 800-item menu and then ordered (coconut curry with chicken and drunken noodles).  The food was fresh, hot, and just as spicy as we wanted it (we ordered Thai hot and almost licked our plates clean!).  I've been home for three hours now and I'm still reliving this amazing culinary experience and I'm already planning my next visit.

Plus I will be back Monday and then again next Thursday. I guess you could say I am addicted.  This is the first restaurant I have been a \"regular\" at.. and I love that they know my exact order. Although I am having a splendid love affair with the yellow curry (medium-hot) today I also got the Kao Pad with Tofu... its my new obsession!  The Buddhas delight appetizer is amazing too. Deep fried tofu wedges with a spicy sweet peanut sauce. MMM MmmMMM.  Do yourself a favor and compliment your meal with a pot of jasmine hot tea too!",

It tasted very strongly of fish sauce, authentic tom yum has a sour bite and instead of having dried chili flakes for the spice, there is spicy chili oil that makes everything blend so well together.  The nam sod was too sweet and lacked of that spicy sour thai taste as well.   I had the pad sa eew. It was too sweet, comparable to hoisin sauce. The sweetness was overwhelming, I felt a little sick and got over the taste pretty quick. My friend got the panang curry. It was too runny for curry and tasted quite bland.  For dessert we had coconut ice cream and sweet sticky rice. The rice was delicious, the ice cream was pretty tasteless by itself, but when eaten with the rice it tasted perfect. For its price though, the portion was not worth it.  The service there is friendly and when asking for their suggestions or opinions on dishes, not very informative, but they do try their best to explain and are honest. I appreciate her effort, accent and all lol.  This is arizona though, im from california, what was I expecting after driving around and seeing how arizona was like lol.

We came during dinner time on a weekend so understandably it was busy. Once we were seated, the waitress came to take our drinks and then never came back for our food order. We thought perhaps she was waiting for the rest of our party to arrive, but even after everyone was seated we were still left waiting with no acknowledgement for at least 15 minutes until we had to flag someone down. I would not say it was because they were understaffed - parties around us were having their orders taken even though they had arrived after us. To top it off, they added the 18% automatic gratuity to the bill even though our party was less than 6 people! They didn't deserve a tip at all.",

But the reason for the five stars was the food. We got the fried calamari and the pad Thai.  The batter for the calamari was light and crispy and the calamari itself was cooked to perfection. The dipping sauce was a great accompaniment.  We got the tofu pad Thai. Best I've had since I moved to Phoenix! We chose our tofu pan fried, but you could also have it soft. Nice choices! The flavor of the pad Thai was what I've been craving.  Great prices, great portions and great food.",

    "text": "I crave the red curry. It's the best comfort food. Lately I've been eating it once a week. I usually get the spice/heat Thai medium or hot. The coconut milk really tempers the heat and gives the broth a nice creaminess. The vegetables are cooked to perfection. I usually get chicken but I've had the shrimp, which was delicious. Most of the time I order to go. The restaurant is beautifully painted and decorated and worth dining in. It's a hidden gem!  The only negative is that it's pricier than other Thai restaurant but it's worth it. So so good.",

I've been here many times and this was not good. $15 for 6 grilled shrimp with little flavor on top of a bed of iceberg lettuce and a ton of raw red onions. Dressing was red chili paste with lime and yes....more onions. So disappointing. The Tom Kha soup had little chicken and was overpowered by lime. Hmmm...I don't think I will be back.   Service was very accommodating and helpful with suggestions. I tried a noodle dish that I typically don't get and liked it. I will return again, as I have been here several times",

    "text": "Somehow, in the last two years of living in this city, I managed to overlook one of the best Thai places in this State. Although I've only been to a handful since moving here, this one is my new go-to place.  A couple of my girlfriends and I came here to celebrate one of their birthdays. This place was about 60% full on a Tuesday night when we got there, which I took to be a pretty good sign. It quickly filled up in the next hour or so.   We ordered: beer, plum wine, green papaya salad, a yellow chicken curry, penang chicken curry and the Evil Jungle Princess dish. That was my choice.   Drinks: They were good Plum wine was a little sweet, but I was expecting that.   Food: For the majority of the dishes, you get to choose to add a protein and also a spice level. We went with a mix of no spice/medium spice.   Green Papaya salad - It's one of my favourite Thai dishes, and they do a superb job here with the balance of flavours. My only complaint was that there was a lot of lettuce used as a filler, but the tangy fish/lime sauce went great with this as well.   Yellow chicken - it's mostly potatoes and chicken. DELICIOUS.  Penang chicken - My family is from Singapore where the cuisine is very similar to Penang, Malaysia, but I couldn't really guess what the Penang curry would taste like. I think there's more depth to the flavours than the yellow curry, and the dish had a richer colour to it. It was really good however, and came with more vegetables than the yellow curry.  Evil Jungle Princess - I had to. Basically, this was a bunch of vegetables cooked in some kind of curry substance that tops a plate of noodles. I forgot there were noodles and also ordered a bowl of rice. For future reference: that bowl of rice is not necessary. This was a really good dish and had a bit more tang to it than the other curries. I really enjoyed that there were a TON of vegetable in this dish. So many in fact that I'm glad I ordered it without a protein.  The servings were large, and we all took food home with us. Fun fact: TSA will look at your leftovers through the x-ray machine and search your bag.   Service: It was great. People were friendly.   I'll be back.",

A suggestion--if you won't seat people & aren't really open until the time stated on your website (& door), you should put that caveat on your website! A simple, \"Note:  we do not seat new tables after 2:30pm,\" or something similar would be very helpful to your potential customers. Not sure if I'll be back.",

Finally after a long wait waitress came with her frowned face that she delivered what had been ordered . Agree it could be our mistake as well but she could have confirm the order.

They also offer a small side of fried rice, which is really tasty and it is nice to be able to order a smaller portion.  Drunken Noodles are great and the roasted chicken is really good too.  I have yet to try the duck, but will soon.  I pick up take-out from here at least once a month and the service is always quick and polite.",

    "text": "What a fantastic find for a Saturday night with a big group!  I came to Yupha's after my friends and I decided to not go to a particular Italian restaurant. I have had some really good Thai food in the past, so I have relatively high standards.  My friends opted for the standards of Pad Thai and Pad See Ew and they were both very respectable renditions of the dish, even surpassing some of my hometown favorites. I however decided on something I had been craving for months after having it at Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas a few weeks prior. The Crispy Roasted Duck.  The duck came on a hot skillet and it was a very generous portion being topped with fresh basil and caramelized onions. The duck itself was cooked more than I would have preferred, but the skin was crispy and the meat was very tender and flavorful. It was very good and I have been craving for it a past few days. Hard to beat good duck......  I also got a soup with coconut milk, mushrooms and chicken. Overall the soup had a great depth of flavor and was also very rich. It was also really really spicy, which made me want it even more.  Overall Yupha's really surprised me. I am often left satisfied, but never blown away with Thai food, but Yupha's is some of the best I have had in the United States. The crispy duck really blew me away and if I am ever in Tempe, I am heading to Yupha's.",

Good lesson in business---your lack of space became my problem; also, if you had asked rather than bully us out of the place, you would probably have a customer willing to return.

The prices are good, food is upmost quality, service is amazing, place is clean and Yuppah's Thai kitchen provides an excellent atmosphere. They offer a large selection of appetizers, Thai drinks, dessert, noodle dishes, entrees, and alcoholic beverages (have not tried yet). My boyfriend and I always get their drunken noodles and the simple, but good salad bar they offer during lunch. I recently tried their Thai iced tea and it made my day! Curry puffs are worth the time. Dinner is a bit pricey for two college students but still worth the go since the foods offered on the dinner menu are not available during lunch and of course, the food is still drool-worthy. Thank you Yuppah's for making me finally enjoy Thai food :)",

Yes, I was that pain in the ass customer that strolled in at 2:33 pm when the places closes at 3pm daily, BUT...that's no excuse for a little bit of discouraging my son and I from coming in to eat. The hostess/waitress immediately advised us that the kitchen closes in 10 minutes. If this is the case, why don't they close at 2:00 or 2:30 pm daily???? We then sat down and were approached with menus and for our drink order. I knew what I wanted so I ordered my drinks and food right away since I was feeling rushed.   This was the time that the staff eat their lunch as they gathered around for break. The waitress was as polite as possible but being rushed is EXTREMELY rude!!!! She brought my check in the middle of enjoying my rushed meal, which was somewhat understandable. I then asked for to-go containers and she responded by reassuring me not to rush. (By this time I'm thinking she's only being courteous to receive a decent tip for \"puting up\" with me!) She even had the nerve to remind me, as my son was finishing up his last bites, that they have to lock the door at three (translation: Get the hell out!!!!) I WILL NEVER BE BACK AND I WILL TELL ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY ABOUT MY CRAPPY EXPERIENCE! It's too bad because the food is outstanding!",

Still had about 4 tables of people and they willingly sat us. from that point forward it was rush, rush rush. we gave drink orders immediately, but when asked two minutes later for our food order and we asked for one more minute we were told the kitchen was closing in 10 minutes. so we quickly ordered all our food (including dessert). first appetizer came out at lightening speed and was delicious. Our two main dishes came 5 minutes later. dessert a few after that. then, about 10 minutes into eating our food, they started moving furniture around, turned on the bright overhead lights and started cleaning for the night. the cashier came over and gave us our bill, telling us she needed to close out the computer now. one server swept up our wine glasses though my dining companion still had wine in it (she stopped her). when we asked about the rush, we were told that the servers had to catch the bus (admittedly, service runs sparsely in our area at night). But, if you want to have your restaurant closed by 9, put out your closed sign by 815 at the latest...don't take us in and then rush our through our meal. we ended up taking half of it home.",

My husband loves the drunken noodles and I thoroughly enjoyed the Pad Thai. We've also tried the sampler appetizer (yummy) and the Tom Yum Goong soup...way too salty! The kids haven't developed a palate for Thai food, so we ordered the American style kids meals they offer, chicken nuggets and fries, disgusting! The kids meals tasted worse than generic brand processed frozen food you would get at the grocery store. Luckily, the desserts made up for their disappointment...the sticky rice and fried banana desserts were excellent (just wish it was bigger!). I am used to amazing Thai restaurants in Northern California, so I am probably biased with my rating. I will visit again, but considering they are a little pricey, probably not more than a few times a year.",

I saw the little salad cart, but no one told us if that was included in our lunch or not. So we sat there trying to make eye contact with someone in order to ask if we could go up there. We finally were able to ask as our food was dropped off. It turns out it is included! That would've been nice to know. We went up and got soup and salad. The salad was alright, fresh, but the dressing wasn't my favorite peanut dressing ever. The soup was kind of boring, not the normal either coconut -y and sweet soup or the tasty veggie and tofu soup.... it was just chicken broth with chopped, not completely cooked bits of carrot in it. Kind of meh. My noodles were alright, they were spicy, but everything was chopped up real tiny so it was hard to find the noodles. This drunken noodle was a lot different than others I have had, it had egg and had way less veg in it. It was alright, but not my favorite. My friend ordered her noodles medium spicy and it was a bit too spicy for her, so that's something to note. I thought the service was fine, not very friendly, but efficient. Overall, this place is alright, not the best, not the worst.",

They have so many dishes that can only be found on their menu like Thai Jerky and Duck 4-5 different ways that one must go back... but even then it's hard because you probably have a favorite dish that you just can't help but order everytime because it's the best you've ever had... what dish you ask?  Well... for me, it's their Pad Seew. Pure Heaven on a plate... the perfect balance of flavor, and the noodles are so fresh! I'm so thankful my friend had the obsession before me and shared it with me so now I am in the same boat. It is Freakin' Awesome (My highest foodie approval rating).  As for the lunch buffet... well, while the vegetable soup and salad is a nice extra, I find it completely unnecessary. The soup is more broth and the I prefer other thai restaurant peanut dressing to theirs... just my humble opinion. Besides, their lunch serving portion is the same size as an entree at dinnertime and filling enough for a second meal.  I only have one note of caution: For those afraid of spice, be forewarned... I think when they ask you what spice level you'd like your meal at, you must say: None... because even mild has a warmer kick than usual. I come from the world of Mild, but have worked on my spice level so I can handle their mild quite well... but for the unspiceables, you've been cautioned! Those who like it Spicy hot... this is the Thai place is for YOU! Ask for Thai Spicy for more heat!  Yupha, I'm so glad your restaurant is in Metro Phoenix and I hope you keep serving up your brand of Pad Seew for years and years to come!",

As others have mentioned, the Drunken Noodles are outstanding.  We've tried two desserts: the sticky rice with mango, and sticky rice topped with coconut ice cream - both were excellent.  We found the crab puffs to be a little oily so we'll skip them next time.  I also like that they serve (non-alcoholic) beverages in a carafe so there's no wait for refills.  Their prices are just a smudge high - two ice teas, two entrees and one dessert came to right around 45.00.  We'll stop in for lunch next time to check out the buffet.",

The food was great, staff was ok....but they are extremely stingy with portion sizes on the rice and the tea. I was shocked when my tea came, I was expecting a big huge glass of yummy Thai tea like most places give you and what I got was a tiny ice cream sundae style glass with a LOT of ice. I'd say my actual tea was about 10 oz, for $2.75 and no refills! The curry was a good portion however they gave me a tiny little bowl of rice and I had to ask for a second serving, which costs an extra $1.50...lame.

I ordered the pad see ew with tofu, medium spicy, and the bf got the fried rice with tofu, hot.  Then we headed to the soup and salad bar.  The salad was not your typical iceberg lettuce, but a great mix of kale and cabbage, and maybe some lettuce too.  There were cucumbers, carrots, tomatoes, red onion and green onions to add to your liking and a peanut dressing that was super yummy!  The soup was a vegetable soup that was broth with diced veggies in it.  I was barely 2 bites into my salad when our entrees arrived!  I snuck a taste of my noodles, before finishing my salad and soup, and then devoured my pad see ew.  It was just wonderful!  Perfect heat level for me, not oily and super flavorful!

Yum nua*   Grilled marinated beef tossed with red onion, scallion, cucumber, tomato & mint leaves dressed in lime juice  854.  Pad Thai   Sauteed rice noodle with chicken & shrimp, brown tofu, egg, scallion, been sprouts, ground peanuts & sweet radish  902.  Yupha's fried rice   Thai fried rice with egg, chicken, onion, pineapple, scallion, cashew nuts & fried shallot  852.  Drunken noodles*   Sauteed flat noodles with Napa cabbage, tomato, bell pepper, onion, egg, Thai basil & chili pepper",

The thai levels are 1-7 and aren't always accurate.  The thai tea here is a little too strong compared to others that I have had at other thai restaurants.  The lunch options are great which include a thai salad and soup.  They are quick and efficient so if you're on a lunch time crunch, you will make it without a worry.  They are super busy all of the time, so keep that in mind.  I would highly recommend trying this place out!",

Don't get me wrong, they are super friendly, but clearly get overwhelmed by the lunch rush of people from local businesses.   Putting that aside, the food is top notch, they make the best Pad Thai I've found in AZ, and if you're brave and get it Thai hot, the burn is so good, but doesn't mask the flavor!  The salad bar with the awesome peanut dressing is a big plus, and they make a tasty Thai iced tea as well. Great lunch spot if you work or live nearby!",

My group of three shared the soft-shelled crabs with veggies and garlic sauce and honey roasted duck with steamed veggies (delish, but half of the plate was duck skin and fat, which doesn't translate to good value for the money).  We still enjoyed dinner, however.  We also ordered the excellent homemade coconut ice cream, which upgrades this review from a three- to a four-star!  My other companions enjoyed apps of chicken satay w/ peanut sauce, and fried and steamed dumplings.  I heard the pad thai was very satisfying.    After conferring with my cousin, who agreed with me that the crabs, while good, weren't as tasty as before, we've decided we'll just stop by when we have a craving for coco ice cream.  Hmm... having ice cream while chatting over a viewing at the discount cinema next door sounds like a great outing to me!",

While others complain of it not being Hot enough, I Ordered mine mild and it was a bit spicier than other places \"mild\" but it was just right to me.  I was first served a bowl of broth with a few veggies(see pics) it was good.  I ordered the Red Curry with Tofu (see pics) I thought it was OK, it was mostly bamboo shoots and peppers with tofu, there were only two green beans and 4 very small pieces of eggplant in there.  Kinda disappointing after the abundance of veggies I've gotten at other places.  Another bummer is they don't serve you that yummy little egg-roll with your meal either. I was really looking forward to that, so I ordered them separately (see pics) and they were not as good as I hoped.  No choice of soup or salad , you just get soup and No egg-roll. So while it wasn't bad, It wasn't fabulous either.   NEXT!  P.S. on their daily special board they misspelled Broccoli as Broccori...hee hee hee",

The place was nearly full, and yet the staff had the time and awareness to greet me right away. The service was quick and we weren't bothered unnecessarily during our lunch cconversation.  I ordered the Pad Garlic Sauce and asked for it medium. It arrived quickly and looked beautiful. It was enough to fill me up for lunch, so I didn't partake of the salad bar and soup, but they did look delicous. My friend had the salad and raved about the peanut dressing.  It was a great expeerience, and I'll return to try more items on the menu. I feel like I've found a locals only treasure a few miles from home.",

I am also very sensitive to what I eat, and I never feel unwell after I eat here, which says a lot.   Their lunch buffet is wonderful.They have vegetable soup and salad with peanut dressing, and you can have as much as you like. For dinner, their entrees are quite large, so you can easily have leftovers for the next day. The prices are very reasonable too. Great place.",

Everything was deep fried besides kabob/chicken. The chicken was cold and tasted like it had Feta cheese on it :(  Drunken Noodles* with Beef Sauteed flat noodles with Napa cabbage, tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, egg, Thai basil & chili pepper.  This was our favorite dish. Spicy and flavorful.  Gaeng Kua Sapparod**with Shrimp \"Red curry sauce, coconut milk, pineapple & kaffir lime leaves.  This did not taste right- like the kitchen ran out of sauce and they just added coconut milk to make it go further. The flavor was totally off. It was also not spicy at all.  Pad Thai with Chicken Sauteed rice noodles with egg, sweet pickled radish, scallion, bean sprouts & ground peanuts.  The dish had no flavor. We had to ask for a lime to ad (usually comes with lime at other Thai restaurants) Very disappointed. Also NOT spicy like we ordered.  The service was slow and disappointing. The place was packed when we got there and I mean so packed it was hard to get to our table and hard for our severs to get around. We wanted to order dessert but nobody asked and we waited FOREVER to get our check.  I would return only after checking out the other Thai restaurants in the area first for comparison.",

I had the pad thai and tried one of the duck dishes. I'm not a huge fan of duck, but this was nice and tender and the sauce was amazing. Whatever sauce it had on it was composed of peppers, mushrooms and ground pork, if that helps you find it on the menu. The drunken dragon is also fabulous, and at $7 for lunch and $10 for dinner, Yupha's a steal. I just finished the other half of my pad thai a minute ago. Yum.  I think it's my favorite Thai in the greater campus area, but then I thought about it and, isn't most of the good food in the Phoenix area in the Tempe area? I think so.   Anyway, Yupha is one cool lady and you can tell they're trying hard with this grand opening. A little ass-kissing is nice, but then again, places like these are for regulars, so I guess they don't have to be overly nice to me. I'm just here to grub.  EAT HERE. And ask for twice the spicy you would normally. The medium is not spicy and the thai hot is medium.",

    "text": "So, the reason for the one star is my experience with the staff. I've had experiences with bad staff before but I've never been posed with this kind.  My friend and I went in to dine around 5ish, when the restaurant seemed empty. We ordered our meal right away and ate in decent time, were done in about a half hour. We stuck around and by this time it was getting to be full. My friend wanted dessert so we ended up getting a yummy bananas foster with ice cream.  Right around this time, after finishing dessert, we were approached by a server, this is around 5:45-5:50, and were asked if we could please pay our bill as there are several other guests awaiting a table.  Am I strange to think this is a very rude thing to say to a patron? Obviously we did not come to your restaurant, drink water and sit for an hour. Then, maybe this question would have been warranted. But paying customers who ate full meals and ordered drinks, you're going to ask them to leave?  I politely spoke to the manager, rather I believe she might have been the owner due to the sizable ring on her finger and designer clothing she had on. She informed me that this was a very delicate situation as nine people were waiting on being seated and asked when we planned on leaving.  Again, since this is the first time this has ever happened to me, it may just be an experience that I haven't had before so feel free to let me know that it's not rude and I just need to be better about eating and leaving in a very timely fashion. But I can tell you, I felt thoroughly insulted and the fact that the owner or mgr was trying to get an ETA on our departure, it wasn't the best feeling on the receiving end.  I won't be going back, and I hope people understand that this is behavior backed by the owner or management, before they choose to dine here.  Oh, and my red curry was not the best I've had. Not the worst, but certainly not worthy of the treatment.",

There is a lot of attention paid to the dining customers and the staff is efficient and friendly.  It also apparent that the owner/manager has a vested interest in serving good food and providing good service AND that her staff is trained to pay attention to details from the kitchen to the tabletops and everywhere in between.",

I was introduced to Yuphas by my boyfriend who has been going here for years, and it's his favorite too, but it's gotten to the point where I want it three times a week and he's wishing he had never taken me there!    I am such a creature of habit, I always get the pad Thai because it is so delicious, my boyfriend is the same way. He gets the drunken noodles- at least I still pretend to look at the menu before I make my decision.   Also I should note, Yuphas is great to dine in too, everyone is super friendly and the service is awesome, but there just something special about eating delicious Thai food in your sweat pants on your couch, watching a movie.",

Since then, I have gone to Yupha's for lunch and it's even more amazing! Their lunch specials are $7.99 and come with unlimited soup and salad bar that you can serve yourself at. The soup is a clear vegetable broth and the salad (kale, cabbage, etc -- super healthy) comes with cucumbers, tomatoes, carrots and onions as garnishes and they have a to-die-for peanut dressing. You can even do an unlimited soup and salad lunch for just $5.99.  I hope you all enjoy Yupha's as much as I do!!",

UGHHHH!    I don't like boiled chicken.   After having it the next day, it wasn't so bad.   I wish they would put more than just huge chunks of potatoes and onions in it, maybe something that would give it a little color contrast??   Oh, well.   The sauce is the best part and I enjoyed the flavoring.  Would I return?    I have had curry chicken at other Thai restaurants where I don't have to ponder whether the chicken is boiled and make a conclusion later.",

First off the salad is delicious using kale and many other veggies plus you top it off with a wonderful peanut dressing! The veggie soup is pretty basic but still good. I ordered phat prik khing and it was so good and fresh and came out the perfect spice level of hot. My husband ordered the pad gra pow Thai hot and he loved it! Service can be a little slow at times but no big deal compared to the food you're getting. The lunch portion is kind of small but with the soup and salad you'll leave there feeling stuffed and happy! We will definitely be going back!",

The waitress was extremely rude from beginning to end and made our first experience uncomfortable. Instead of explaining in a patient/kind manner, she became frustrated quickly when my grandfather didn't understand the menu right away. She jabbed her fingers at the menu and rolled her eyes and raised her voice at him. My grandfather is not an obnoxious person, nor is he one to act rudely to anyone. We all watched her in disbelief because we couldn't believe what we were seeing/hearing. I have personal experience working as a waitress myself in busy restaurants and I have NEVER, EVER acted in such a rude, horrid manner to even the most ridiculously obnoxious customers. We left with a bad taste in our mouths JUST BECAUSE OF THE SERVICE, which is a shame. Because the food was amazing. Dear management, thank you for the food, but please instruct your employees in basic manners. I'm very hesitant to recommend this place to friends and family. Please fix this problem or you will lose more customers this way.",

I normally get mine in hot and occasionally Thai Hot, my husband orders mild or medium. I also love their Tom Kha soup with chicken. Their Thai iced tea is pretty delicious, not too sweet; its perfect. We have not been able to find another Thai restaurant that nearly compares.

I didn't like my dish, it was too sweet and had no spice level. We asked a server for chili sauce which helped slightly, but it's not the same as cooking with spice. The temperature of the dish seemed to vary; some bites were warm and others were hot. Everyone else enjoyed their food, I probably should've tried a curry dish instead. I'd visit again and try a different entree to get a better idea of their offerings.",

Service time was ok, but friendly.  ordered: green curry with chicken, hot level. Order was brought out pretty promptly, like within 10-15mins.  but after you order, they have a bar that you can get salad with their peanut dressing and soup. Refill as you like, just make sure you finish what you get. Don't be greedy. First thai place that I have seen do this. Nevertheless, love the salad.   so once you get some salad and soup in, meal is out already. Green curry, size portion average, good enough to hit the spot if you finish it all. they didn't skimp on rice quantity to curry. Love the flavor of the curry, not watery. but not too thick. I would try \"thai hot\" next time. They do have additional chili sauce and hot pepper flake to add on side. Which made it about right.   Price was around $10.45.  great.   I also was able to taste the yellow curry special of the week. Not to bad as well. Though more of a cumin or some spice that was more overpowering. but not bad.   recommend coming lunch time. They have weekly lunch specials posted online.  Will definitely come back in future.",

I have tried many items on the menu and everything is amazing. My favorite is the Drunken Noodles with chicken. Be careful with the spice level because they can make it HOT! I like spicy food and I usually do a level 3, I don't like when it's so spicy you can't taste the flavor.   We also love their curry. The red is our favorite! A large bowl with a generous helping of vegetables and meat of your choice (I do pork on mine). They come with warm rice that is the perfect texture.   The best deal is their lunch specials. If you dine in you can get a lunch size portion and it comes with a spring roll, you then help yourself to the unlimited soup and salad bar. The peanut salad dressing is to die for!  If you are not too familiar with Thai food or want to try something new I would recommend getting the appetizer sampler. Everything is yummy!",

    "text": "Server polite, but totally slacking.  Only came by table once after our food arrived.  She took our order, eventually, but didn't bring drink menu, water, soda, wine, or food.  Minor correction, she brought one soda refill and had to be flagged over so we could ask for another drink refill and glass of wine. It was quite a wait and we had since finished our meal, so I walked to cashier and let her know I did not want that glass of wine but would take our check. Two minutes after I return to my seat a glass of wine arrives.  Our entrees were good, with one exception, we asked for MEDIUM spice and we got next to none.   This restaurant gets a continual flow of business, I would think they could get some consistency in wait/kitchen staff. We liked to come here because of the spice and menu items are not a common thing for us.   Good food, but just not on par. Decent service should be part of the dining experience.  This was an obvious miss tonight.",

I ordered (if you've read my other Thai restaurant reviews - prepare to be unsurprised) Panang beef...I went with medium spice level (because I'm old and spicy hurts me now ;-) and it was perfect...much hotter, and I would've been suffering for it, any less, and it would've been disappointing...nailed it!  Everyone in our party enjoyed what they ordered...and, for a change, we ordered dessert.  A couple of flaming fried ice creams and a coconut ice cream - all were very tasty.  You know what, scratch what I said at the top - even if you're NOT in the Temp area, but are hungry for some Thai food, head to Yupha's!!",

Well \"fortunately\" the place we decided to try out was closed, so with the help of \"Yelp\" we found Yupha's. As we are \"Thai Junkies\" we carried on with our Thai Tour 2012..next stop Yupha's..  We walked in and we were greeted with a warm smile as soon as we walked through the door. We were seated, we sat down, we changed our minds. So i asked if we could sit at a different table, the waitress said,that section was closed. Hhmmm bizarre, oh well, so we settled, no big deal. We came here for the food. I have to say that this place was very clean with a relaxing, ambient setting.    We placed our order. We ordered the Siam Wrap for an appetizer, then we placed our order. I ordered the Drunken Noodle, my companion, she ordered the Red Curry. As soon as we placed our order, we were offered the salad bar for their lunch time special. Let me tell you! The Peanut sauce/dressing was GREAT!!! We went back for more. The veggies were fresh, as well as the salad. I mean I can drink the peanut sauce, it was that good. By the time we were half way into our salad, our Siam wrap came. Excellent! The minced chicken was great! very well seasoned, I even used the peanut sauce with the wrap as well. Now came the Goodness, That was quick, was my reply. The drunken noodle was fantastic, an even amount of ingredients, the chicken was perfect, it seemed like some of the chicken was shredded, not a bad idea! The Red Curry was to die for, not literally. It had a different flavor, that I'm not used to. It had a lemon grassy flavor, the curry was thick, not too fishy, and a plenty even amount of ingredients.   Our table was completely covered with food. Now that's how you eat Thai..   I'm putting Yupha's on my top three for Red Curry. I cant wait to try their other dishes..   Yupha's gets 5 stars! Ill be back!",

    "text": "Our friends go to this joint a lot and raved about it so we decided to give it a try since we were in the area.  We've both been to Thailand numerous times and have frequented plenty of local as well as out-of-state Thai restaurants...and this place was a real let down.  We ordered the Pad See Ew and the Spicy Eggplant (w/shrimp & chicken) and also Thai ice tea.  We ordered both dishes at a level \"1\" spicy.  Even though we both could eat medium spicy...we weren't in the mood for really spicy food...so decided to go w/a \"1\" just for a little kick.  I can pretty much predict how the food is going to be by judging the Thai ice tea...and it appeared too clear, tasted watered down (lacking in the essential tea flavor), too sweet & had an artificial sweetener after taste.  My Spicy Eggplant looked beautiful upon arrival and I got my hopes up...but once I dug in...it was way too spicy.  I'm not sure if there was no flavor to my dish or if it was so spicy I couldn't taste the flavor. When the lady came back to ask me how my food was and I told her it was really spicy for a 1...she told me I should order it non-spicy the next time.  I thought that was kind of dismissive since I didn't want my food non-spicy...just at the level that I ordered and could enjoy.  All the meat & vegetable also looked like it had been steamed or boiled and then a sauce poured over it...no absolutely no pan sauteed look, smell or taste.  Our Pad See Ew noodle was mushy and unappetizing...and it didn't taste too much better than it looked.  I did notice that it wasn't as oily as stirred fried noodles usually are so maybe that's why it was clumpy & mushy?  One good thing I do have to say about the place is that the decor and ambiance was really nice and the rest of the wait staff were friendly.  Overall, I would have given this place 3 stars if it hadn't been for the patronizing attitude from the one lady.",

Next the Tom kai with chicken was similar to Panang curry in soup form with lemongrass and cilantro flavors.  Very delicious. One of us got drunken noodles.  It was sweet and spicy \"it was good.\"   I had the Panang chicken and I'm pretty certain that if I was on death row I would order this as a last meal.  Large extra rice.   For dessert we tried ordering the sticky rice with mangoes and they were out.   Not \"cool.\" So we ordered the flaming ice cream its like tempura fried ice cream with fire and rum.  It was probably the least tasty item of the night.",

One of the best Thai restaurants in the Valley.  Traditional, not too Westernized, they try to mix it up occasionally with specials like Northern Thai dishes such as khao soi.  (Definitely not as good as Lotus of Siam in Vegas, which is 5 stars.)  But they don't go too sweet in their dishes to cater to Western tastes, and they do tend to go a little spicier than normal, which I appreciate.  We've had a pretty wide range of their dishes.  Their tom yum gai could afford to be a little more sour, but it is pretty good.  Their curries have been more than passably good, and apart from the occasional too-soft noddle, their noddle dishes are well-spiced and well-balanced with good size portions.  They have more duck selections on their menu than most other Thai joints, and they have been pretty good as well.  It's not the best Thai in the country, but it comes to being pretty close to the best in the Valley.  Better than Chanpen, yes.",

We went on a Saturday night -before- Valentine's day the next day, and it was crowded, yet not -packed- packed.We did not have to wait, though there was a wait list for a larger table.  We were snagged by a waitress, she took our drink order[ more on that later], we got our water. Then a -different- waitress came to our table, took our appetizer order and right away asked for our dinner order selection.before we had even decided on our appetizer, pen hovering impatiently over order pad. Ok then.  My husband ordered the crispy duck [Ped Gaeng Daeng* $18.00  Crispy roast duck topped red curry, coconut milk, tomatoes, pineapple, bell peppers & Thai basil.]. It arrived as we were still nibbling on our appetizer, without rice.[ different waitress -again-].And sat there.Waiting on my order I assume?  There was nothing crispy about it- in fact, skin was\"wet\", and it was dry in inself[an admirable feat, achieving both at the same time, and yet here we were].They usually make amazing duck, but this blew.  At this point in time, my order arrives[Sizzling Cod Filet with Soy and Ginger Sauce $18.99 Healthy, light and delicious Cod filet steamed in soy sauce, ginger, leek, fresh shitake mushroom and white wine, served on hot skillet.].  At this point, rice arrives for us both[tiny portion]. By now, my husband's duck is cold. had he been supposed to choke it down -before- my food came?It kinda -was- a pre valentine's date.  My cod was very nice, but...it kinda is hard to mess up <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcod.It&s=b6bf655ded9043f5769e6de0443d4039f4a5eac83a9ba317839e73c13da3f89e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">cod.It</a> was in a lovely, fragrant broth, sure, but 19 bucks worth of broth and magical unicorn tears? probably not.  Our drink orders?No where to be seen.Still.[ we had ordered thai iced teas]  As my husband is hacking away at his  \"crispy\"duck, ANOTHER server comes over, and asks if we are done.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FYes.at&s=806517c701ace05f44dfd6cfc06e3c3f6dde9d55cc71955a0fe6b466eb9a5842\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yes.at</a> that point we really were.  We did not tip.Consciously. Because I have worked in the food industry for many a year.I've been a waitress. And the food was ok ish, there was no. service. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fto.be&s=5776409badfe2d990c53b9366f6a0f058752a0116ce349587452d0874a7d638f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">to.be</a>.seen.Who were we supposed to tip?the waitress who sat us down?the one who took our order?Or maybe the one who forgot our drinks?Or maybe the one who brought out the duck before the rest of the food?

It's adequately spiced, not over done where you don't taste any other flavours.  The owner is quite helpful recommending items, just in case you aren't sure.  The ambience looks lovely. Should probably try dining in the next time.",

You have the option of adding carrots or cucumbers to your salad, I passed. The soup was everything I wanted. I love a vegetable soup with a yummy broth. I ordered the Pad Garlic Sauce with Chicken - heat level: Thai Hot.   The dish had garlic and mixed vegetables. I didn't care for the cabbage served in my dish. I was expecting the food to be spicier. If you don't like heat, this may have been the dish for you. My lunch came with an eggroll and white rice.   I normally do not like Thai Tea, but Yupha's Thai Tea was the best I've tried. It was very sweet and full of flavor.   I highly recommend the tea, would suggest you order a different dish. I have my eyes set on the their Chicken Pad Thai for my next visit.",

This is the second time we've ordered food here on a holiday weekend and the food has been way worse quality than normal.  I think they must let the second-string chef cook on holiday weekends or something.  The beef noodle soup that I've ordered twice before had a completely different color broth than usual and a completely different flavor.  My boyfriend said the panang curry didn't taste like peanuts at all.  The sticky rice and mango came with hard/dry/not cooked enough sticky rice and less mango pieces than we usually get (usually get 7-8 pieces, this time for 4 pieces).  Edit - the photo associated with this review was from a different time we ordered in the restaurant. My review above is when we ordered takeout on Labor Day weekend.",

I was able to call a few days ahead and make a lunch reservation for myself and a small group.   Our server was kind to wait for awhile while we awaited for stragglers to arrive. We all ordered off the lunch menu which includes the self-serving soup and salad bar - a rather new concept I've seen for a Thai restaurant. I liked it as I was able to pile on a hefty salad with their delicious dressing.   Almost immediately as we all sat down with our soup and salads did our lunch entrees come out. Crazy quick! Since they were piping hot it wasn't a rush to eat thru the \"appetizer round\". I went with Pad Garlic Sauce, and while it was delicious, there wasn't terribly anything unique about it compared to other local Thai places. Not disappointing, just another good Thai option to keep in the back of my mind for future reference.",

    "text": "It's time for the second installation of \"Julia and Sophia's Food Adventure\" where we go to a place we've never tried before.  This week's pick is Yupha's Thai Kitchen which had been on both of our lists for quite some time. To sweeten the deal a mutual friend, Chelsea, came with as well.  To start off I ordered the Golden Curry Puffs, Julia had the Papaya Salad, and Chelsea got the fried egg rolls. The Golden Curry Puffs were phenomenal. I don't think I've ever tried anything like them in my life. If I could cater a party I would want numerous trays of these things. The pastry they're in doesn't fall apart in your hands but also isn't mushy. They have a crunch on the outside but the inside is tender and packed with flavor. The Papaya Salad was tangy and a little spicy (ordered at a 3/5 spicy) and was generally well-liked. Finally, the fried rolls weren't too flakey and had a good clean flavor. However, the Golden Curry Puffs were the clear winner here. 10/10 would come here again just for those puffs. For main entrees I ordered the Pra Ram (3/5 spicy), Julia got Pad Thai (3/5 spicy) and Chelsea got Tom Ka soup (also 3/5 spicy). While I didn't try Chelsea's soup it looked and smelled very good. The Pad Thai and Pra Ram had some peculiarities though. For starters, Julia's Pad Thai had noticeable spice to it while my Pra Ram had none. Both were ordered 3/5 spicy so this kind of surprised me. Julia's Pad Thai also seemed to be hotter temperaturewise. I could see the steam coming off of it will the Pra Ram seemed to be closer to room temperature. That being said, I wasn't disappointed with the flavor save for the lack of spicyness. The peanut glazed chicken on top of the mixed veggies was very satisfying and I felt like I was eating something good. (Compared to how you might feel gross eating something greasy.) The bite of Pad Thai that I had was packed with flavor. This is probably the best Pad Thai I've had in Tempe so far.  Overall the three of us really enjoyed Yupha's Thai Kitchen. My recommendation would be to order your food a little hotter just in case you don't get any spiciness at all though. The 3/5 didn't even tingle. Oh, and don't forget the Golden Curry Puffs!",

    "text": "Best Thai place not only in Tempe, but in the Phoenix area.  For an appetizer, I have never encountered Siam Wraps at any other Thai restaurant, but the minced chicken wrapped in lettuce is reason enough to visit.   For a soup, their Tom Yum is perfect. I'll just leave it at that.   Their Drunken Noodles and Pad Thai are exactly what they should be with fresh meat and vegetables. I'm not a huge curry fan, so I can't speak to that, but if you love noodle dishes, you're going to the right place.  Their levels of spiciness are fair. If you want spicy food, order it Thai hot. I like food that's considered spicy by the most and it's perfect for me. However, if you want VERY spicy food, have a conversation with your waiter and they'll surely accommodate you.",

    "text": "Absolutely fantastic.  During my first dinner at Yupha's, I remember commenting that these people really give a shit -- and that, to me, is the difference between an awesome restaurant and an average one.  Everything from the freshness of the ingredients, the tenderness of the fish, the crispness of the vegetables, the delicacy of the herbs and spices, the aroma of the Jasmine tea, the texture of sticky rice -- you name it, and these guys are all over it.  I highly recommend the curries, the tilapia, the garlic and pepper dishes, and, of course, the sticky rice desserts.  If there's one downside to this place for me, it's that their vegetarian options are somewhat lacking in all menu sections.  But since I eat fish, eggs, and dairy products, I can deal.  If you're vegan, you may find it a bit challenging to order straight off the menu.  This is one of my absolutely favorite places to eat.",

The food is authentic except for the spice rating. Mild at Yupha's can be bland compared to the intensity that was considered mild over there.   The environment is really pleasant and it's one of the few Thai places  where the staff actually indulge my poor Thai language skills with enthusiasm and a smile.",

They have \"Thai Hot\" and on the menu state that if it is too hot you can't send it back to the kitchen.  I wasn't totally destroyed by the hot, but I'm not sure whether it's because my hot tolerance really has gone through the roof or they secretly went a little easy on me because I'm a nerdy little white girl.  They have the AC blasting so if you're one of those get cold easily because you're dressed for the 90 degrees outside - bring a jacket.  Oh and their coconut ice cream sticky rice dessert was AMAZING.  And like the other review said they are off McClintock now at the Tempe theater shopping center.   Southeast corner of McClintock and Elliot.",

    "text": "Yupha's is located in the same plaza as Vincitorio's Restaurant on the Southeast corner of McClintock and Elliot. They used to be located on Rural and Elliot, but have moved to this new location in the past year. The space is big, open and modern; with high ceilings, minimal furniture and modern art, it makes for a very relaxing vibe. We arrived at 6:30 on a Thursday night, and while the place wasn't completely full, most of the tables were occupied. Our waitress came by and took our beverage order, and then gave us some time to look over the menu. And time she gave us, because it seemed like it was 10 minutes before she finally returned; they must have been understaffed that night, because it was just her and one other waitress covering the whole restaurant, so we decided not to get to upset by this.  When she finally did return to take our order, she couldn't have been more pleasant; answering our random questions and suggesting items on the menu. We got the Thai Rolls and some Tom Kha Gai to start.. The rolls were cooked to a nice, golden, crunchy brown, but they were seriously lacking in the veggie department. The plum sauce was good, but they are probably not something that I would recommend for anyone to order.  I absolutely love Tom Kha Gai soup, but almost every Thai restaurant that I go to doesn't offer just a single serving bowl of it, they get all fancy and serve it in these giant silver urns, so I rarely end up ordering it. When I saw that I was able to order just a bowl of the soup, I knew that I had to give this version a try. Well, I have to say, this was the best version I have ever had; it had a touch of heat, mixed with the cool coconut and lime leaves, it was heavenly. My sister had never tried this kind of soup, so I scooped some into a bowl for her and she too thought that it was really good. The flavors were so well balanced, that I really could have eaten a giant urn full of this version!  I got the Pad Thai as my main dish....it was AMAZING!!!  The best pad thai I have had to date; sweet and spicy and just all around great.  I was impressed by how un-greasy it was, my only disappointment with it was that it came with just 2 shrimp!  My sister got the roasted duck, which she loved, they gave her the whole duck!  Our friends ordered the beef green curry, extra hot, and thought that is was good too.  Other than the spotty service, which I am chalking up to a bad night, and the skimpy Thai Rolls....Yupha's is my new favorite Thai place!  I just wish that I lived closer!",

    "text": "Ok, I'm new to the whole Thai food thing, and I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy food, so take this review for what it is....  I was told by plenty of uber-Thai food fans that this place was the bee's knees, but I wasn't too impressed. i kept it pretty standard ordering just pad thai noodles with tofu and iced tea. the iced tea was killer (i find that at most thai places, what is it with the iced thai tea phenomenon??)  the flavor was pretty bland, i have to say. it was the right amount of spicy, but just still bland, no bueno. plus, for a thai place, they did not cook the tofu well, it was totally bland, too.  i was disappointed, but i will probably go one more time because you never know if you just catch a restaurant on an off day. it was super busy on a tuesday lunch hour, too, but we got in and out pretty quickly, so it's good for a work lunch.  ***update 1/08 I'm glad I made that disclaimer in my original review, because I've been back three times (only for p/u) and it's now one of my top thai places. Maybe I was bitter because my editor took me there for my year review to tell me the paper couldn't afford more than 3 percent raise (on a reporter's salary, that's about 35 cents - you can imagine my bitterness). Hahahaha. I'm still not 100 percent a fan of their tofu, but the other entrees I've tried are not as bland as my OG visit.  It's a great spot to pick up even if I just walk in and order because, what I assume is the owner (a middle-aged Asian women who dresses professional), is SOOO nice and helpful* with the menu and there is a small bar (really small, like 4-5 seats) where I can order a draft and hang out for the 10-15 minutes it takes to make my order.  *definition of \"soooo nice and helpful\": She answered all our questions regarding level of spiciness and confusion over which entrees included noodles or rice patiently and with a smile; suggested one of the most delicious fried banana/ice cream desserts I've ever had; and, one time she realized we weren't finished with our beers when our tightly packaged food was place on the bar, so she spent five minutes undoing the tie to poke holes in the to-go boxes so the steam could escape and not make our food \"sweaty\". RIGHT ON!  that definitely earned them an extra star for service! so... more like 3 and half  *************************** i'm bumping up another half star because their stellar customer service is dead-ion consistent every single time i come here. i highly recommend the Yupha's House fried rice with tofu - flavorful and not too greasy. and big points for being able to order every single item on the menu as spicy as you want it.",

I was disappointed in the Tom Kah soup, as it wasn't really served or even tasted quite like the way I'm used to it, and it's usually my favorite thing on a Thai menu. The bigger downside was slow, though friendly, service.   I couldn't tell if they were understaffed because all the girls serving and busing looked the same to me, honestly, so that may have been the problem, or I might just be kinda racist.  Worst of all, perhaps particular to our experience or the product of popularity and layout, was the noisy couples surrounding us.  It was hard NOT to hear their conversation even over the noise of eating our own meals, and it made my dinner mate and me oddly self conscious and uncomfortably aware of a lack of privacy for our own conversation.  So yeah, two stars.  Sorry, nothing personal, just overrated.",

    "text": "After reading the other review, and trying this for myself I had to register to voice my opinion. - 1st review.  I had an excellent experience.  This is about my 20th Thai restaurant that I have dined at.  For people familiar with Phoenix Thai places, this is far better than Thai basil, swadhi Thai, and Thai-rama.  This is on par with Thai Thai in Scottsdale.  I ordered the Pad Gra Pow for lunch.  It was 6.95 and I received the traditional Thai start soup (which is seasoned broth with scallions and herbs).  The Pad Gra Pow came out very fast and had a heaping scoop of white rice.  The dish had fresh green bell pepper, red bell pepper, onion, and white meat chicken.  I usually order hot to thai-hot but when trying a new place I always go for the medium.  This dish surprised me with a nice kick from the Thai chili peppers that were in the sauce which was equally balanced with sweetness from the Thai King Basil.  I highly recommend this as I will be going back tomorrow since I enjoyed it that much.  *According to the website, the owner grows all the herbs used in the dish in a personal garden*",

The artwork was fun to look at while we waited for our food to arrive.  I ordered pad se ew with chicken (my mainstay Thai dish) and had wild berry tea as a beverage. The tea was amazing, with fresh berries added which gave it a natural flavor as well as a lovely snack once I was finished with the drink. My husband ordered drunken noodle, Thai spicy and it was definitely just that. My pad se ew was cooked perfectly. The noodles looked like they were made in-house and the black soy sauce was a perfect mix of salty with a bit of sweetness. The broccoli and chicken were all cooked perfectly and there was a nice balance of all three ingredients. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about Thai food and gave very good recommendations. If I even find myself in the Phoenix area again I will definitely be making a return visit.",

We kept having to ask the server for more water.   The wait here is normally longer for lunch since it's so busy so just be prepared for that.",

    "text": "Yupha's is close to home and A SERIOUS FIND!  On a Friday evening, 7 PM, I got the urge for papaya salad.  My Yelp mobile App found Yupha's as one of the Thai restaurants close to home.  I got in the truck and headed east to Yupha's in anticipation of, because it was Friday, a bit of a wait when I got to the restaurant.  Arriving at Yupha's, the parking in front of the restaurant was pretty full.  Entering the establishment, I took in what was about 20 tables seated, some dining, some waiting for food, and some just finishing their meals.  I was met at the door quickly and ushered to a table.  The waitress presented me with a menu and asked what I would prefer to drink.  I ordered water and looked at the menu.  My water was delivered in about a minute, and I advised I was ready to order.  The waitress took my order for Som Tom, Thai Hot, along with a side of Jasmine rice.  The prices in the menu are cheaper than the prices on the website, so I was pleasantly surprised.    The restaurant is easy on the eyes...subdued lighting, tinted windows and partitions throughout that provided a sense of defined space and some privacy at the same time.  Music was subtle, conversation there, but not too loud.  The water was filtered and served with lemon, very refreshing.  My wait for dinner was not nearly as long as I anticipated.  From ordering to being served, I waited barely 5 minutes.  The portions of salad and rice were both impressive, about 2 1/2 cups for the Som Tom and about 1 1/2 cups of rice.  The salad was nearly perfect!  The spice was right on (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat, 10 (Thai Hot) brings tears to my eyes.  The dressing was a bit sweet for my tastes, so I asked the waitress for some lime.  She was gone barely 30 seconds and back.  The accents of sweet, sour, spicy and salty were perfect!  I also experienced hints of garlic that were just right.  My server came back and asked if I needed extra napkins as the tears were beginning to run down my face.  I advised that everything was wonderful and I had enough napkins.    Thank you, Yupha!  You have certainly proven your skills!  I also appreciate that you have the fortitude to display that firearms are not allowed in your restaurant.  It is gratifying to see that you are willing to state your preference toward a violence-free experience.  Know that I will return!",

The exceptional Kao Pad (fried rice) doesn't look or taste like your typical fried rice. The house sauce they use for Pad Pak is droolworthy. And the spring rolls are the best i've had.  If you dine-in for lunch and order a meal, you get the salad bar. Not a lot of variety (kale, cabbage, cucumber, carrot...) but it's always very fresh. Smother with the HPS (Holy Peanut Sauce) for some gustatory nirvana.   Decor is earthy and artistic. Only unintrusive, instrumental Thai music plays. On the front counter (an actual work of art btw), there's always an offering of fresh food for the Buddha. When it gets real busy (every day) watch the amazing Sam sprout a 3rd and 4th arm to keep the place running and the customers happy.  If you go for lunch, try to arrive by 11:30 because they really pak it in. Just don't get there before me.",

My only complaint, is that at quarter to 9pm, (closing time during the week) the staff begins to make you feel very uncomfortable. They were taking things off our table at 8:45 pm. Packing up our food. Asking if I want a plastic bag.They took our wine glasses and our bottle of wine before we were through. The manager was ready by the front with her keys in hand, to lock the door as soon as we were all gone. We were not the only two people in the restaurant. There were 2 other parties at tables, getting the same bum rush that we were getting. It nearly ruined the experience for us. Meanwhile, the staff was all eating dinner together in the rear of the dining room.  At exactly 9 p.m. the lights were turned all the way up. I have been a server and it is annoying when people stay far past closing time. However, this is too extreme. I will still come here for dinner, but I will go early so my meal is not ruined by staff trying to rush us out.",

    "text": "The food was great. I get the Yupha's Fried Rice or the Pad Thai. My girlfriend gets the curry.  They ask you how spicy on a scale of 1-10. The first time we got a 4 and a 6 and we were both dying (and I eat spicy food all the time, raw peppers, etc). This time we got a 1 and a 2 and it wasn't spicy enough. I think I'll go with a three next time.  BUT:  My only complaint is the \"No Firearms Allowed\" sign. For those of you with CCW permits, please take note of this because it will instantly turn you off to spending your money somewhere. Since they serve alcohol, people without permits already can't legally carry there, but since I have a permit I am legally allowed to carry in a place that serves alcohol (I don't drink, obviously). I probably won't be returning due to this when there are countless places in the Phoenix area that respect my right to self-defense.",

The food is probably the best food I've found in the area, but compared to all of the Thai places I would frequent in Chicago, Yupha's is rather sub-par. Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but the prices are pretty high. (Some prices are higher than Chicago prices). Another one of my biggest qualms with Yupha's is that the food is rather inconsistent.  I once ordered the Tom Yum which was great, but the second time was terrible. I also ordered the House Salad which is really good, but I was surprised at how small it was, a couple weeks later it came with extra ingredients and was huge.  Overall, it's definitely a place to try, especially if you're critical of your Thai food. It'll probably be the best Thai food in Phoenix, but I still can't believe some of the prices.",

For an appetizer, we shared a Golden Curry Puff which had a pastry crust that was a perfect combination of golden crispy and tender and flaky. Two in our party ordered the Yupha's Seafood #803. The presentation of the Yupha's Seafood dish was an unexpected surprise, with the seafood wrapped in a foil peacock. Luckily, the food inside lived up to the presentation. I had the Green Curry (#401) with seafood which was perfectly medium-hot. There were large pieces of shrimp, calamari and mussels. Another member of our party tried the Himalai (#800) and said that it was excellent. I sampled small amounts of all the dishes and the ingredients tasted fresh and the seasoning was delicious. For dessert we shared the flaming-ice-cream which had generous quantities of rum and the homemade coconut ice cream over sticky rice. Both were delicious and a perfect conclusion to our meal. I also had their French press coffee which was served in a French-themed mug which was a charming touch. I'm eager to see if a return visit will as satisfying.",

Love at first bite!  I like to compliment it with the sweet and sour entree with tofu. I get it mild and it's plenty spicy for my taste. The sweet and sour is not like that of a Chinese restaurant, but I'm thinking I like it better. It's more like sweet and spice and that is A-OK with me. It is also a generous portion and includes a side of white rice which is delicious when drenched in the sauce.  The staff has always been incredibly nice and the service is usually pretty speedy. I like the setting of the dining area too, it's usually pretty quiet when I've been in there and it's a relaxing setting.  I would definitely recommend going here to anyone looking for some delicious Thai food!",

It does get crowded so I try to usually come here after 1pm when the crowd dies down a bit. This is yet another place where I constantly run into groups of people from my workplace. Heck we might as well just hold all our meetings here. Maybe the attendance would improve.   Parking is never a problem as it's part of a big mall. Service is always pretty good even if the  place is packed. Probably because this place has so many regulars. I know folks that come here more than once a week. I usually go for the lunch special -  posted right at the entrance. The lunch menu is not that big so the specials are often the thing to try. If not for the specials I go for the red curry.  Nice and spicy. Oh yeah. You start out with a salad buffet with peanut sauce dressing. You can also get soup with that. Very reasonably priced for all you  get.",

The food was fresh and flavorful, albeit rather uninspired. I had the pad thai and my husband had one of the chicken lunch specials. There was about a 30 minute wait for the dishes, which was not too bad considering how many people were in the restaurant. The salad and soup do-it-yourself bar was a pleasant surprise, and we helped ourselves to many bowls of soup while we waited.  The presentation of the food at Yuphas is really beautiful, and the portions are notably large as well. All in all, a great place to go if you're craving Thai and happen to be in the area. I may have to go back to try some other things on their menu.  One thing that did bother me, however, was how close together the tables are. It made it rather awkward at times.",

She ordered an appetizer and an entree, I just ordered an entree.  About half way through our meal, I managed to get the server's attention and asked about the never delivered appetizer.  She went to check, and returned in a while, apologizing for the delay, saying it was her fault, not the cook's fault.  As we finished our lunch, along came the appetizer.  I think it was called Buddha's delight, not sure.  Fried tofu puffs with a dipping sauce.  We each ate just one because we were full.  The b-day girl took the rest home.  Then came the check, with no appetizer on the bill.  I assumed we were comped the appetizer due to their mistake so I said nothing and put my money on the tray.  She took it, then quickly returned, saying the bill was incorrect.  Another bill, with the appetizer included, was on the little tray.  I said nothing and put more money down.  I will never go back there again.  What tacky service!  As for my lunch, it was just ok.  I have had \"drunken noodle\" at other Thai restaurants in Tempe that was much better.",

You can't go wrong with whatever delicious specials their chefs have created each day, and their teas and desserts are always wonderful too.

I have issues leaving my comfort zone.  Well we ordered the Kew Something appetizer, which is basically pork wontons.  As in, seven pork molecules in a wonton with some sweet and sour on the side.  Tasty, but not the sort of thing that I'd pay $6 for.  One star deduction.  But I had Kao Pad (which is a little disturbing sounding) but it is essentially fried rice.  With onions and tomatoes and egg and scallions.  She asked if I wanted it spicy.  I did.  She looked at me like I was a fool, as if I couldn't hang.  I can.  I don't generally love fried rice with spice, but I do like rhyming.  So I tried it, and it was amazing.  Really probably the best fried rice I've had in years.  Next time I'd try beef instead of pork but no complaints--for $8 you get a ton of it and it is sensational.  The spice is pretty hot.  I got hot, which is not as hot as Thai Spicy, but still spicy for sure.  I was fine with it, because that's just how I roll, but Dallas G's head was sweating profusely, creating quite a look.  Kind of like a shabby chic, with sweat.  Anyway.  I have yet to try anything else but what I had was delish.  And unlike my suspect co-worker, you can trust me.",

    "text": "I have traveled across the internet to sing the praises of a certain Thai restaurant. Through a semester and a half of research with one of my favorite ASU professors, we had dined at Yupha's Thai Kitchen once. It was incredible! One of the best Thai meals I've ever had was overshadowed by some service faux pas and thus they lost a star in my book... but the food (!) oh the food...   We began our meal with a sampler platter, it was a big plate of deep fried beige. Normally, this would repulse me and wish for some creativity, but I gave it a go before I started my ranting and it was SO good! the thai rolls are your basic deep fried spring rolls, at least the ingredients were fresh. but the plum sauce was great and it went well with the fried dumplings and I always enjoy fried tofu!  I ordered #850 the Lard Na. Thick noodles in a gravy with veggies. I was happy with it. I ordered it to be cooked at medium heat with a chili tray. Our server was very happy to accommodate me. :) But the highlight of the meal was my friend's meal. He ordered #812 Thai Beef Jerky. It was a nice hunk of beef that was marinated and then deep fried and served with sticky rice and a nice dipping sauce. It was crispy, tender, flavorful with a combination of spices I never really had before. I loved every bite I stole from my friend. The sticky rice went perfectly with it. It was served on this leaf atop a plate and the leaf perfumed the rice. It was a perfect dish. I *need* you to give it a try also!!   We capped off our meal with the Fried Banana & I cream. An Americanized Thai classic done right. I could have used a lil LESS honey in all honesty but that's just me.   Now for the bad news...  Everyone at the table got their food except for me. It took another 20 minutes for me to get my Lard Na. *harsh sigh* really?? I know Thai places usually serve food as its ready and not necessarily when the table's orders are all completed. But 20 minutes! Come on! AAAAND... the worst food crime didn't even happen at my table: at a table near me, a dish of hot food, pineapple fried rice maybe and the guests were a little bewildered at its sight but still began to eat it. They used the serving utensils and dished some of it out, one of them put the utensil in their mouth and began using instead of a fork or chopsticks (something I do sometimes too) . They laughed about getting free food... at the same time, another table got their food and same thing... one person was left out. **harsher sigh** and THEN the server realized what she had done, she gave the dish to the wrong table. So in what I consider to be very gross more than anything. The server grabbed the rice dish and its utensil that was sitting next to the dish on the table  from the table it was delivered to and brought it to the table it was supposed to go to. half eaten, with an obvious dent in it. Before the guest could say something, the server re-fluffed the rice and left the table. **shudder**  To My Fellow Yelpers: That's gross. And yet I stand by my 4 star review. The food's THAT good! But when you go, be sure to keep an eye on the servers. Just to be safe and speak up when your server serves you a half eaten dish.",

I have gotten both dishes medium heat, they let you choose, and both times the top of my head has started sweating so consider yourself duelly warned.  The fried rice is really good and the portion is huge.  I, of course, eat every last grain on my plate and leave fully satiated.  It comes with a small spring roll and a soup and salad bar are included in the price of lunch.  The warm peanut dressing for the salad is really good.

He said it had good Yelp reviews and was close to his house. I reluctantly agreed, mainly because the last Thai place he took me to was kind of \"meh\". I'm very happy that I agreed because this place was awesome. So awesome, that I have been back multiple times!! I've been to a few other Thai places around town, many of which are good, but non as good as Yupha's!! I strongly urge you to try this place, I don't think you will regret it!",

    "text": "When my family went to eat dinner on a Friday night, there were lots of people in the restaurant. It was a medium-large sized restaurant, and there was some wait time. We didn't mind, because there are couches inside near the cashier and some seating areas outside.  One of the first things I noticed about the restaurant were the modern Thai decorations. They had large photos hanging from the walls, as well as some Buddha decorations that went nicely with the overall atmosphere of the restaurant.   Overall, there was friendly service, although the waitress could have been more attentive; she was nice but didn't check once until the end. To be fair, the restaurant was very busy and there was a water jug that we could fill our own waters with.  The noise level was a bit loud, but there were lots of people in the restaurant. I think we were seated near the kitchen, because there were busy waiters coming out; we constantly heard the clanking of dishes. It might have been quieter on other days and in other areas of the restaurant.   I got the Massaman curry, which was good. It had a nice strong coconut flavor, and came with a choice of tofu or chicken and potatoes. My mom got the drunken noodles, which were good in small amounts but perhaps not so much in large quantities; the sauce was overbearing (quite salty). My sister got the pad thai, which I thought was the best out of the three dishes. I would recommend the pad thai.   Overall, very satisfied. I feel like my experience would have been more amplified if the restaurant wasn't so busy, but I probably will come back again. I'm a fan!",

We ordered the Gaeng Kua Sapparod with tofu and the drunken noodles also with tofu. I enjoyed both, but I was particularly fond of the curry. Subtly sweet coconut broth enhanced by the big hunks of pineapple, lime leaves, and fried tofu. The drunken noodles were like any drunken noodles, nothing special to report. I liked them though, for sure. I only wish the serving of jasmine rice had been larger. We needed to order a second bowl.   Service was prompt, friendly, and courteous. The place was near closing and a little messy, but it wasn't bothersome. I'll be back. Lots of yummy dishes to try.",

    "text": "When my office moved from its other location, I thought that was the end of my Thai food for lunch, since the place I used to go to is now on the other side of town, but a friend told me about Yupha's right up the street from, so I thought it was time to go investigate! Grabbed a couple of coworker/friends and off we went!  We arrived little after 12; we were a party of 3 and were seated right away. After I sat down, I looked around and thought this is a really cute place, I like how its set up and how the lights hang and the art on the walls, and how tables are divided by bamboo, I liked the place just by site now.  Now I was looking at the lunch menu, soo many choices to pick from, I had been craving Pad Thai forever, so for this trip that's what I ordered, the Pad Thai lunch special, and some Thai Tea. With the lunch special it came with soup and salad, and the soup and salad are all you can eat, wow that's cool, because the lunch special price was like $7.99, that's a bangin good deal!  The salad was good, but what made it great was the spicy peanut sauce they have for the dressing, OHHHH MMMYYY GAWD!! That stuff is amazing, I think next time I'll have less salad and more sauce , I know, that's bad, but it's that good, and the soup, that's great tasting soup, it's a vegetable soup, but extremely clear broth, so tasty! Glad I gave it a try, because I'm not really a soup person.  Ok when I ordered my lunch, the waitress asked what spicy level would I want it, I was thinking of playing it safe since this was my 1st time there and I was unsure, and she told they have different levels, no spice, mild, medium, hot, Thai Hot, Double Hot and Triple Hot, and I thought to myself, if they have a double hot & Triple hot, then Im going to start at Thai Hot and that's what I did baby!  It was packing heat, but I think next time I will give the Double or Triple hot a try! The dish was perfect!! The entire lunch was very delish!  I look forward to making this a regular lunch time spot for me and to trying their entire lunch menu to find me a favorite! I think next I'll try there Red Curry!",

Almost immediately someone else came by and asked if we needed anything else, we are replied no, I was not done with my drink or my food and the waitress said OK I'll bring you the bill. Food was ok just like any other thai restaurant. I don't want to pull the race card but we were the only Hispanic in the restaurant, and we were shocked because I've never been treated like that. There were a lot of empty tables around, so they were rushing us for no apparent reason, we ordered, ate and left in 22 minutes total. I would give a zero star but I cant apparently. Not going back there nor I recommend it.",

I ordered the tom yum with seafood and my wife ordered the  Evil Jungle Princess.  The reason she ordered it was a previous Poster Chritabel T said it had TONS of Vegetables.  Unfortunately, it had very few vegetables.  She was disapointed.  So if your ordering the Evil Jungle Princess and want TONS of vegetables you better ask your server.   My tom yum was great!  Very flavorful and aromatic.  Loved it.  Because of the inconsistency of vegetables on the Evil Jungle Princess i cant give it a 5.",

I appreciate that it was not too oily or salty but just right.  It came with a piece of egg roll which was light and crispy.  Good portion--I didn't finish it all but I was decently full & satisfied :)  +Venue itself is clean and decorated nicely.  +Service was attentive and very accommodating.

    "text": "I was not as impressed with this place as I am with Thailicious or Tasty Thai. I did enjoy their soup, but I really like the salad that Thailicious serves a lot more. The peanut dressing is better at Thailicious too. Tasty Thai has an amazing salad, but its more of a pepper dressing that is equally amazing, just different, not sweet like the peanut dressing. I had the Pad See Ew which was OK. I like the Pad See Ew from Thai Basil the most. My lunch buddy had the Drunken Noodles and I have to admit, they were really good! I wished I would have ordered that instead. The little spring rolls were good, but I enjoyed them the least out of any other Thai restaurant in the valley I have been to. This place was recommended to me but I don't think I will be back unless my friends talk me into going with them for lunch again. And if I do go, I will be getting the drunken noodles for sure! There are other Thai restaurants around that have better food and cost the same. We got there around 11:30 and at around 11:50 it started filling up quick, so if you do want to try it out, get there early before it fills up. They also charge extra to split plates and charge extra for to-go. I have never been to another Thai place that does that.  Overall, friendly staff, ok salad, great soup, ok food.",

Lots of veggies and shrimp, a little more noodles maybe. The red curry w chicken was our favorite. We ordered it mild as my husband doesn't like really spicy food. It could have been a little hotter, but that was our fault. It was very good. We will be back to discover their best dishes as they have real potential ! Very quiet.

They just seem to be a little sweet and runny -- maybe somewhat Americanized.   The service has also not been great on my last couple of visits. Nothing terrible, and I may have come near the end of the lunch shift, but I got the impression that the servers would rather chat with each other or finish their side work than come over and help me.

First of all, the food was really yummy and there was a ton of it.  We consulted our waitress and she was really helpful in terms of making recommendations.  My pad thai was delicious, as were the spring rolls and peanut sauce.  As always, there were plenty of leftovers for later snacking.  My friends highly recommended their appetizers as well.

My husband got the Thai jerky - hot - and while he liked it, he thought the beef was a a little too crispy and took away from the flavor a little bit.

    "text": "I used to enjoy this restaurant.  However, after today's lunch experience, I am left with a sour taste in my mouth (literally, too). My friend and I walked in and was not greeted.  We waited until we were finally lead to a table.  Two lunch menus were thrown at us.  However, no alcoholic beverages.  I asked for a drinks menu and the waitress pointed at the soda/coffee/tea beverage portion at the bottom and seemed very impatient.  When I said drinks with alcohol, she sneered said...\"umm....okay...\"  Is it usual to drink a little bit for lunch? Then, my friend had a question about the basil used there:  is it regular sweet basil or the more fabulous and exquisite spicy Holy basil.  The waitress rolled her eyes and said it was the \"better kind\".  That doesn't explain anything, so my friend asked to see the basil (he's particular about taste).  The waitress grunted and grumpily brought out the basil.  It was the regular sweet Thai basil.   My friend decided to order another dish because he doesn't like regular sweet basil and asked why he doesn't see Panang Curry on the menu.  The waitress once again rolled her eyes and said \"Do you think it's dinner now or something?  That's only on the dinner menu.\"  She did offer to make a dinner exception but we were turned off by then.  We ended up ordering the red curry.  (Seriously, why is panang curry only a dinner thing?) When the food finally arrived, it was lukewarm.  My friend asked for Thai spicy, and it was very mild.  I, even with my sensitive stomach, didn't even feel the heat. For the price, it was pricy!  And the portions are small.  We did get a lot of white rice, but white rice is cheap anyway. Needless to say, I won't be coming back!",

The included soup and salad round out an excellent meal. Service starts with a smile at the front counter, quick seating or addition to the wait list (they always fill up), and efficient order taking. All of the staff are dedicated to taking care of you well beyond what we should expect from a $10/head lunch place. I can't find a reason to go to any other Thai restaurant.  Only downside is that Yupha's always fills up at peak times. Those in the know know that a short wait is always worth the amazing food and service.",

    "text": "First let me state that i have lived in Thailand for more than three years.  Yupha's Kitchen is the best Thai food in Phoenix.  Thai food is my favorite cuisine.  The French invaded Thailand and held it as a colony for may decades.  During that time the French cooking techniques were merged with the traditional Asian ingredients and techniques.  The result is modern Thai food, the greatest food today.  So with regard to rating a specific restaurant there are three components.  The authenticity of the food, the quality of the food, and the quality of the service.  Yupha's Kitchen is a winner on all three.  The owner (always present) definitely knows how to cook authentic Thai recipes.  The mix of fish sauce and lime is perfect, the mix of protein and spice is perfect, and the mix of textures is perfect.  Secondly the ingredients that are served are top notch.  I have eaten at many Thai restaurants that really do get the spice mix part but want to serve less than top grade proteins.  At Yupha's you will get very fresh chicken or beef or pork.  Thirdly the service at Yupha's is amazing.  As a world traveler, I will say not only is Yapha's the best Thai food in Phoenix, it is one of the best in the west period.  Wes",

Pad Woon Sen with Chicken ($10) - delicious!  Usually when I order this dish at the Thai restaurant near my house, the thin rice noodle is all broken and mushy.

When I have ordered out during lunch, it is always crowded (at least for weekdays), so I would make sure to come early. The food was authentic and cooked consistently well. The only reason why I have knocked it down a star (a half star if I could) is that my orders have not always been right or on time. I call in 15 minutes beforehand and they tell me when my food will be ready. However, twice I have showed up and had to wait at least another 10 minutes because my food was not ready. Another time, my request to not have any bean sprouts was not accepted and I ended up having to pick out all the beansprouts. Obviously, these aren't the end of the world problems, but things to consider.   It is a little bit more expensive than Swaddee and not as big of portions, but the food itself is on par.",

Sits in the Pollack Tempe plaza close to the cinemas, comic store, etc. the restaurant is decorated with large Thai art like the huge floating market painting and huge faces of the Buddha and notes of bamboo dividers between some tables and the entrance walk-in. Smells of the food resonated from the nose to my tummy.   So much to choose from: March specials and regular menu items. I had to try the Drunken Noodles and the Panang Curry which are my Go-to dishes.   Drunken noodles: Mild. Chicken. Onions. Bell peppers. Tomato. Napa cabbage. Thai basil. Flat noodles. Sweet. Savory. $10.50  Panang Curry. Medium. Chicken. String beans. Red bell peppers. Lime leaves. Coconut milk. One small bowl of rice. Sweet n savory.  $12  Fried Banana with ice cream. $7.50  Small bowl of rice: $1.50. Disappointingly a little overpriced especially since the Panang curry came with only one small bowl to begin with. I personally think the Panang curry should have at least come with 2 small bowl worth of rice. The rest of the curry liquid needs the rice to complement the dish.   I originally wanted the March special dessert: mango and blueberry stuffed crepe for $5.99 but unfortunately they were out!!   Waitress and staff were smiley, polite and helpful!",

Best thing in the menu is the Drunken Noodles. The Garlic Chicken is made with a sauce that is drinkable good. The Phad Thai is solid and you can get it as spicy as you can stand it or as mild as you'd like. The spice is fantastic if you can stand it.  Yupha's isn't cheap and is nearly always busy.

    "text": "Solid Thai place that I have eaten at on a couple different occasions when in town.  Service has always been friendly and polite.  I started with the Calamari Strips, which were quite good.  A different way to have Calamari, but they still light and perfect to dip in the accompanying mayo chile sauce.  For my main course, I opted for the Pad Garlic Sauce with Pork, which comes with white rice as well.  The sauce was delicious and really complimented the seasoning in the pork.  A nice combination of flavors, and just the right portion size.  No leftovers to take home, but filling.  It left me just enough room to finish off the meal with their Thai Tea ice cream.  Unique and light, it was a nice end to the meal.  Overall this is a nice spot to grab a bite when your cravings for Thai kick in!",

    "text": "I really wish that I could give this restaurant a better review because the food was really good. For the food alone, I'd give this place 4 stars.  We saw many great reviews on yelp for this restaurant, so we decided to give it a try. It was pretty busy when we went in which was expected as it was a Friday night. We expected a wait but there was none & we were seated promptly. The waitress was completely in a hurry & seemed like she wanted us to order right away. Since we had never been to the restaurant, we were taking a look through the menu & trying to make a decision.  After a few moments, we decided to order the Drunken Noodles with Chicken, medium spice & the Pad Garlic Sauce with Chicken, medium plus spice. About 25 minutes after we had ordered, we finally got our order. No one checked on us during that time to let us know our food was coming or asked us if we wanted to order something while we waited as it was going to be a while. Considering how hungry we were, we definitely would've ordered an appetizer.  Like previously mentioned, the food was really good. The Drunken Noodles were full of flavor & the spice level was just right. The Pad Garlic Sauce was the same way. It came with a side of steamed mixed vegetables, which honestly, I wish they would've tossed them in the garlic sauce with the chicken but since it was a large bowl, I mixed together the rice & vegetables in it.  I've eaten at quite a few different Thai restaurants in the area & it seemed like the portion sizes at this restaurant were smaller than what they normally are. For the taste, I guess it could be argued that it was worth the cost ... Maybe.  After we had finished our meal, our waitress came back & dropped off the check. She didn't ask if we wanted any dessert or how our meal was (no one checked in with us while we were eating either). Not sure if we will come back .. If we do, it'll probably just be to pick up an order.",

I ordered one of the day's luncheon specials, \"Pumpkin Delight.\" I chose chicken as the protein, and the dish was prepared with scallions, egg, and of course pumpkin, which was cooked to a perfect consistency. A large scoop of jasmine rice was served on the side, which I liked, since I'm restricting my carbs and could take as little, or as much, as I wanted. The sauce was just the right balance of sweet and spicy. My husband couldn't decide on just one thing and ordered the appetizer \"Sampler.\" He enjoyed every bite.  Although the restaurant seemed to be a bit crowded with tables and booths, the room wasn't noisy, and we didn't feel \"packed in.\" The decor and ambience had a relaxed effect that added to the overall experience.   Our server and an additional staff member came over to ask us how everything was. Nice touch...  We were celebrating an anniversary and wanted a glass of wine, but the menu didn't indicate that wine was available. I asked about it, and the server gladly brought us a wine list. It would be nice if there was a line in the menu: \"Please ask for our wine list\" or something similar.  This will be our new go-to place for Thai food. We're anxious to work our way through the menu!",

The food: i tried yellow curry, spring rolls, and sweet n sour soup. The yellow curry was ok, but lacked freshness, flavor, and vegetables. It has potatoes and half an onion in it. The spring roll was disgusting and tasted like it lay in cold oil for hours before being reheated and served to us. And the soup was flavored water, again void of real ingredients.  The service: Flat, no hello, just what do you want, I'm to busy to care attitude. The runner didnt even look at us when she brought our food out, she literally threw the food on the table,  turned, and went back to kitchen.  Bland, vanilla food void of ingredients.

They serve up some delicious Thai salads and TomYum soup in the flaming bowl along with  appetizer samplers.   The seating is a little bit cramped and since there is no designated sections it can get noisy and chaotic at peak times.  If that is your cup of tea, then more power to ya...the waitress/ service can vary from extremely helpful to apathetic and standoff-ish.  We have had to send back a couple of plates due to errors ... but they always replace correctly. Yupha the owner always makes things right. A bit pricy for the amount of food given.  That being said I am sure they will be here for years to come, as the younger crowd seems to love this place.  As for me, I will re review at lunch to see if it is any better.   The green curry with seafood was decent ,but I have had much better at C**n in Chandler.    Come here if in the area, but don't expect the red carpet to be rolled out and trumpets blaring. 3 stars UPDATED. 11/10/17 We decided to give them another Friday night try. Again they were buried with customers and to go orders.  There was a birthday party and every table was being used.  We waited for about 10 minutes then were offered  a nice corner table . The salad was delicious and the TomYum soup spot on.   The owner was there and attended to us since I 3 starred them last time .  It was a bit annoying though as she kept asking again and again if the salad was ok.  A better experience but still not a 5 star place in my opinion.   Too crowded too noisy.   Not for me  Good wait staff this time though.  C",

    "text": "Hello, lunch special! For $9,99 - you get a kale salad from the salad bar with a warm peanut dressing, vegetable broth soup, and entree and a spring roll. You can't beat it. Plus they are quick - so you can get in and out of the place in close to a half hour if you want to. Don't be weary of the large lunch crowd - the tables turn quickly and you will be happy that you waited.  Beyond it being inexpensive, it is worth every penny. I am completely in love with the red chicken curry. It's savory and spicy - has lots of veggies - eggplant, peppers, carrots, bamboo shoots. It is very filling - but hard not to eat the whole plate.   I have also loved the drunken noodles.   I would say that the Tom Kha Gai soup - it is very good, but it is a little overwhelmingly strong in the lemongrass department.   I really haven't gone wrong here. I have recently recruited my coworkers to jump on the bandwagon - and they are just as much as a fan as me! So if you are in the area, try it out.",

Since I don't like going on negative tirades when I have no resentment or anger toward the establishment, I'm going to phrase everything in a more positive way!  Yupha's totally passed with flying colors the following tests:  1. Is my chicken satay devoid of flavor test: PASS 2. Is the meat in my entree dry: PASS 3. Does the portion seem skimpy even for the lunch special price?  PASS  Really there are only 3 redeeming things to be found here:  1. Par thai iced tea. 2. Friendly, on point service - can't deny this at all. 3. FLAMING ICE CREAM (I would go back just for this)",

They have a few levels of spiciness. Mild, medium, hot, Thai hot and up. I chose mild, which was a mistake, IMO. I think medium would be ideal for me. Anyways, if you love spicy foods or feeling a little adventurous with your taste buds or crazy, you can try the Thai hot as the guy next to me seemed like he was crying and choking when he ate that.   Overall, solid food, solid prices and solid environment. Oh, and there's a $3 theatre right next door if you wanna catch a movie after dinner.",

My friend and I ordered the drunken noodles (since everyone bragged about it), tom yum hot pot, and a beef salad. I wasn't very impressed by the drunken noodles since its too sweet on top and when I dig into the bottom it was a little too salty. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it but probably won't order it again. The Tom yum soup was flavorful, maybe cause I like my food spicy and sour. The soup could use a bit more meat in it. As for the beef salad, it was fresh but the meat could use a bit more flavor. Ordered two side of rice to eat with our soup and I was surprised that they charge $1.50 for a scoop of rice each. Maybe .75-$1 would be a decent price for it but $1.50? I'm not stingy when it comes to food, but for that price they should at least gave me a full bowl, not a small ice cream scoop of it. Overall, the bill came out to about $32 for all the food and rice, not bad.   Service was decent since it was not busy. The waitresses sat in the middle of the restaurant talking in their native language and only look up when you call for them. Overall, my waitress was attentive enough and friendly, and you won't have to ask for water refills because they bring out a pitcher along with the cups right when you are seated.   I'd go there again whenever I'm in the neighborhood.",

Yupha is about a couple miles west on Elliot off the 101 freeway.    I entered in and saw the special of the day, which was a pumpkin dish with whatever meat or tofu.  Most Thai dishes are known to be pretty spicy, and I was curious to try something more on the sweeter end.  It was still right after Thanksgiving, and it was an appropriate time to try a festive dish.  While I was waiting, they offered us a soup and salad bar to get something to appease us for a few minutes.  This is the first time I have ever seen this, which is the main reason this rating goes from a 4 to a 5 star.    The pumpkin dish was really good!  The thai spices to go along with the sweetness was the ultimate complement.  All of my friends loved their meals too.",

    "text": "I don't know how it's possible that I haven't written a review for Yupha's already because it is by far my favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix. Their food is so delicious and flavorful. And they don't skimp on the spice. Their hot level is actually really spicy and they even have a level above it that they call \"Thai hot\". I also really like the cute and colorful decor and laid back atmosphere. Just be aware that they close at 9pm sharp on weeknights.  My favorite dish is the drunken noodles. I just love the sweet and tangy flavor of the sauce and the yummy wide rice noodles. And they make it with plenty of fresh veggies in there too. My husband really likes the Crying Tiger. If you are a steak lover then this is your best option. Most of the other items you can get with your choice of chicken, pork, tofu, or seafood. Last time I was there I went with a couple friends and they wanted curry but I don't usually like Thai curries because I don't care for the taste of coconut milk in savory dishes. So we tried the Pad Prik Khing (#302) and it was fantastic. We got it medium but next time I am going to try it hot! We also tried the papaya salad which is probably something I wouldn't have ordered on my own but it was very good and we all really liked it! The dressing was very light and had that Thai sweet/sour/umami flavor too it and I loved the crunchy texture from the peanuts. I have also tried a couple of their soups and they are awesome. I usually finish the meal off with the mango and sticky rice dessert but last time they didn't have it because mangos are out of season. The mangos they serve with this are sooo sweet an juicy so I guess that is why they only offer it seasonally. So, instead we tried the fried banana with ice cream which was just ok. Too much honey for my taste.  If you are a Thai food lover like me then you can't go wrong with Yupha's. The service is not always perfect but the food is amazing!",

At first I wasn't sure it was a good thing, but they have really grown on me.  They all tend to be saucier than other versions, but I have really grown to like it.  I'm not sure which way they are supposed to be as I have never been to Thailand so I will say they are good and different.  The staff is here has actually been consistently nice and helpfully.  Today I went for lunch and they were packed ( I actually had left another thai restaurant that had forgotten they had sat me ) but I was seated promptly and my food came out incredibly fast.

I love Yupha's, their food has always been good enough to warrant a 30+ minute drive to get there. However tonight they were severely understaffed for Valentines Day, which lead to a terrible experience.  After waiting over 20 minutes to put in our order our server asked if I wanted my curry spicy, and I said yes as it was how I have ordered it in the past. She did not specify how spicy, and when I received it was to the point where I couldn't even taste my delicious food because my mouth was on fire. She had put in for Thai hot. Queue another 20 minute wait with empty drinks and my boyfriends food getting cold as we waited for our waitress to come by our table again.    They did replace my order no questions asked, but the service is honestly the worst I have received. I used to waitress, and am very patient in most circumstances but after nearly two hours, most of which was spent waiting to even see our MIA server I was not impressed. If I had received a smile, or even 30 seconds more of her time the entire situation could have been avoided or at least I wouldn't have left with such a bad taste in my mouth.   I will be returning for take-out in the future as the food is delicious, but I will never eat here in person again as the service was a real downer on a great day!",

The head chef and owner often comes out to make sure everything was perfect. They serve plenty of beers including domestics as well as foreign beers for a great price.  The atmosphere is authentic and feels like a foreign country, which adds to the experience. And the bathrooms are BEAUTIFUL inside. Not only clean, but decorated to the nines.   Not too pricey! 2 meals and a couple of beers only came out to around 40 dollars and it was VERY WELL worth it! You need to experience this place!!!",

They also feature animal cruelty free soaps and lotions in their nice bathrooms.  The problem is, when I go, which has been 3 times now, I only like one of the 50% of the food that is ordered.  That which I do like though, is pretty good.  It's just kinda hit and miss for finding something that I'll like.    It'd be the kinda place to go if you find one dish and just stick with it maybe.  For me for now though... I think I'll keep looking for my favorite neighborhood Thai.  I'd still easily go if friends wanna meet there though.  Possibly see ya there.",

Anyways, the food was great, wait wasn't long, and fresh atmosphere. They also do some pretty creative things with their presentation.

I especially like the yellow curry and the drunken noodles. I am vegetarian, and thus always get all entrees with tofu. The texture on the tofu has been spectacular every time I have been at Yupha's (I hate soft/silken tofu, and the tofu here is fried to the perfect crispiness). The spice level has always been adequate (I like spicy, but not Thai spicy) and has been spot on every time I go there, compared to other Thai restaurants in the Valley (for e.g. Thai Basil, Thai Rama etc.), where I have found there to be day-to-day variation.",

Let it be known that they close for a short period between lunch and dinner so you have to make it before 3pm for lunch or after 5pm for dinner.  The lunch was very nice although the lunch menu had somewhat limited options in comparison to the numerous dinner menu offerings.  The lunch menu offered the most popular Thai fare for an average lunch price.  During their lunch hours, Yuhpa's offers a little soup and salad bar at which you can make your own little Thai salad and/or soup.  Although soup and salad bar is very basic, I was impressed with sweet and rich peanut dressing and the ornately cut cucumbers.  The ambiance was pleasant with it's contemporary decor and high ceilings.  My dinner visit was much more exciting as the dinner menu was far more extensive with some unique Thai dishes such as the Thai Jerky with Papaya salad.....both delicious, I might add!  The curry was very good also.  The presentation of everything was lovely as well.  I also noticed upon leaving that they have a live Jazz band that plays on certain nights, something that I will surely be back to check out.  Indeed I have many dishes to try before I add Yupha's to my list of favorite Thai restaurants, but it has definitely caught the attention of my taste buds for my future Tempe Thai cravings!",

I eat those hot yellow chiles and love them though they cause the same reaction.  When I order a MILDLY spicy dish, I expect mild, esp when I want to be sweat free going out after my meal.

I had the Green Curry special (with chicken - it's my most favorite item on a Thai menu); flavorful, fresh. HOT and delicious!  The $8.95 special included a trip to the salad/soup bar.  FRESH is the primary reaction to this addition - a warmed peanut dressing topped the beautifully sliced veggies for the salad (tomato, onion, cucumber, etc.) tossed onto a serving of head lettuces, carrots and the likes.  The amazingly tasty vegetable soup  was flavorful and light - loaded with fresh, crisp veggies.  Our entrees arrived steaming hot and cooked to perfection.  Each dish was accompanied with a crispy Thai roll.   We ate too much but every bite was more delicious than the one before.  I'll go back again and again!  (You can take in a cheap movie next door at the Pollack Theater).  To Melissa W. of 2/11/2011 - I LOVE hot and spicy foods....they met my desires.  However, if you don't want it hot, tell them.  They'll most certainly accommodate you.",
