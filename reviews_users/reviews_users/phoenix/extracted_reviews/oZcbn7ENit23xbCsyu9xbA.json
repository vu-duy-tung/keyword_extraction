I sat down for my 7PM reservation at 7:10PM...no problem...ordered 4 sushi rolls and a large beer for my wife and I. We are in the area for vacation and eat sushi at least once a month. The first roll came to us 70 minutes after ordering and the final roll came out 95 minutes after ordering. Honestly they were average at best...would never go back here...at least they sent us some free edamami since they noticed we were wasting away during our wait.",

One of our entree's arrvied before the appetizer, I reminded the waitress 3 times that we were still waiting on an entree which still hadnt arrived after an hour and a half. I asked for the check, reviewed it and asked the waitress whether or not they felt they should do anything for us because the poor service. She took it to the owner who sent it back un changed with a different waitress. I let them know I would not be paying since i came to dinner expecting to get an entree and since I didnt get one that I would not be parying for dinner. I let them know that if they would  pay me for my time which was wasted and then I would pay for what I ate. They would not discuss. I walked out, they followed me to the parking lot and called the police. I would advise you to not waste your time with an establishment who clearly does not understand the service industry!",

They ship eveything in from Japan, even their charcoal, and their wood!!! My husband and I go here all the time, we love to sit at the bar and talk to Ryan, the bartender/ one of the owners, he's alot of fun, and increadably knowagable about the food.  Everytime we go there we have always run into people that are regulars that go there all time, and love it as much as we do.... We never feel rushed, or unconfortable, we always feel good to be there, that they are happy to have us!!! The owner Yasu is always in the kitchen putting his mark in everything that go's out of that kitchen, making sure that it absolulty wonderfull, and everything always is, we have never had a bad, or even average meal here, it has always been excellent!!!",

    "text": "My husband and I have been \"regulars\" at Yasu since we discovered it. However, given the poor treatment we received last week, we will not be returning.  We were entertaining 2 business associates and I called around 4 pm to ensure hours and make a reservation. I was told that I wouldn't need a reservation for four around 6:30 pm. We arrived promptly at 6:30, but were told that it would be at least an hour wait. I spoke with the manager about the phone call, noting recognition in his eyes, but he told me that he couldn't do anything at all to help us because he had taken several reservation after I called. I mentioned that I was specifically told that I wouldn't need a reservation. He said he would be happy to make a reservation for me if I call in the future. Well, that just won't be happening. He then scurrried away and hid at the bar, allowing his equally rude hostess to deal with us, even after asking to speak with him again. The immature way in which this incident was handled leads me to believe that Yasu can't make good when they make a mistake. If they just would have made some accomodation to note the mistake of not giving me a reservation, I would not be posting this, but just can't let this go and felt my fellow diners should beware - you're SOL if Yasu makes a mistake.",

So we brought friends to share the wonderful food.  However, we had a very neglectful waiter who returned to our table only occasionally.  We wrote down all the items we wanted to order and everything came out together except a salmon skin roll.  Over 30 minutes later the waiter brought if (it had been 1 hour since we had ordered it) and said it takes a long time to make these.  Our party had ordered this same roll at many other restaurants so we knew how it was made.  The waiter talked as though the 1 hour wait was usual.  We knew better.  Dessert (which was a deep fried banana) also took over 1/2 hour.  The restaurant was not busy.  It was a Sunday evening and still we were neglected by our waiter.  The 4 of us will NEVER return to this restaurant no matter how good the food.  There are many other choices.",

    "text": "First, I'm half-Japanese and I've been to Japan several times. I'm fortunate that I have relatives in Japan so I get the experience the \"real Japan\" when I visit. Therefore, I'll admit to be somewhat of a snob when it comes to Japanese Restaurants. My girlfriend and I were in Phoenix/Scottsdale for our first visit to Spring Training and we were newbies to the iPhone world. Wondering where to go for dinner and wanting something special, my girlfriend fired up her iPhone and jumped onto Yelp. After a fairly quick hunt, she came across this restaurant and the many glowing reviews. I have to admit that I was more than a little skeptical and thought that \"I'll be the judge\" about how good the food really is. Like I said, I'm a snob. Well, lo and behold, the reviews were spot on and the food was delicious, the service was very good. I'm getting hungry, just thinking about how delicious the food was that night. You'll see I rated the price range \"spendy,\" but don't let that deter you from visiting. I would rather pay a little more for great food, than pay less for mediocre food. My only regret is that living in Sacramento, CA, I won't be able to visit this fine restaurant on a regular basis. However, I think we might become regulars for Spring Training. If so, I know where I'll be having dinner at least once, each time I visit the Phoenix area. One final note. We had heard that Daisuke Matsuzaka had received a special dinner and that MLB players frequented the restaurant. I'm fairly certain that former pitcher, Jason Schmidt, was having dinner at the restaurant that night. Since my girlfriend is a rabid Giants fan and Schmidt is a onetime Giant, that was a nice treat for her.",

It can be just a smidge pricier than some other sushi places, but you are paying for quality and you get it. They do have happy hour during the week which goes through 6pm and gives you a nice selection of tapas and sushi for $5 a pop.  The atmosphere feels very authentic. Yasu is front and center of the very small dining room...often he is conversing with guests and overall just looking like he's having a great time. It's part of the charm of eating here. He is also very passionate about his food and it shows. He will often make recommendations about what is fresh and different for the day. You feel like you are in good hands when you eat here, like someone has your back in the kitchen.   There is a huge selection, far too big to even discuss individual plates/sushi options. In fact, if I had one complaint it's that they have too many menus. For a first time diner it can be a little daunting to sort it all out. You've got the daily menu, the regular menu, the tapas menu, the sushi menu, and I think one other menu. Simplifying things, would be the only thing I would change at this otherwise heavenly spot.  I highly recommend this spot, it has spoiled me and become the measuring stick I compare other local sushi joints to.   4.75/5.",

    "text": "I have been on Yelp for quite some time now reading reviews and enjoying other's recommendations. My experience on Saturday night at Yasu prompted me to write my first review.  It was my buddy's ASU graduation. We decided to do dinner then head to our VIP Table Reservation at Narcisse after at Scottsdale Quarter. He loves sushi and I heard that Yasu was awesome, so instead of hitting up a trendy place in Scottsdale, I opted to reserve a table at Yasu.  The reservation for our party of four was at 7:30. I had pre-paid bottled service at Narcisse and didn't want to be late. I figured an hour and a half was plenty of time. WRONG!  We arrived about 7:20-7:25. We were promptly greeted by the hostess and led to our table. There were about eight other tables in the restaurant and a few people at the sushi bar. After about 15 minutes of not being acknowledged by any server (there were at least four), I asked the bus boy to find someone. Five minutes later the hostess came over and said \"Micky\" was our server and she didn't know she had our table. I asked the hostess how everyone could have walked by at least a dozen times (including herself) and not notice that we had not ordered. She shrugged her shoulders and walked off.   Another five minutes later (it's now almost 7:45), Micky arrives. No apologies, no rush of service. We ordered our drinks and food at the same time. We order four types of rolls, teriyaki chicken, ponzu jidori chicken, edamame, miso soup and tempura.  At 7:05 our edamame comes. 7:10 our miso soup. Over the course of the next 15 minutes, our rolls come trickling out one by one. It's now almost 7:25. I asked Micky where our chicken was. She said \"two more minutes.\" Ten minutes later she brings our teriyaki chicken. I told her that we needed the check and that we were in a rush. She disappears. She comes back with the tempura. No sign of the ponzu chicken, but at this point I did not care. She comes back ten minutes later with the other chicken, leaves and comes back with the check.  We had about ten minutes to inhale both chicken dishes and the tempura.  Other tables came and went with the exception of ours and the table next to us, who was complaining that they had been waiting nearly 20 minutes for some sort of dessert dish.   The food? AMAZING! The rolls were awesome, the soup tasty and the ponzu chicken OMG... the best chicken I have ever eaten.   The service? Easily THE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE I have ever had in a restaurant.   After were ordered, our drinks were never refilled (water or Iced Tea) and were never offered any other alcoholic beverages either.   I have been a server in the past and could not for the life of me figure out what her problem was. Even if she had all eight tables, it couldn't have taken her that long to greet us, ring in the order and bring it out. She was simply BEYOND disorganized. It appeared that she had not put our order in until almost 8:00 when the edamame come out. It was almost like she was making the food herself. The whole experience was truly bizzare.   I was tempted to leave, go to the Fry's Signature on Shea, buy some pre-made sushi rolls and bring them back. In the time it took her to bring us our soup, I could have!  We were late to Narcisse, but luckily, there is something to the service given at over-priced Scottsdale night clubs. That part of the evening was perfect.  Would I go back? I would give them one more try, only if I had a different server.",

We were given 5 or 6 different paper printed menus and could not figure out the dishes for anything. The waiter gave explanations that were just too involved and frankly made us more confused. What he didn't explain was that each overpriced dish was barely enough for one person. And the prices were just ridiculous. The raw fish was warm. I would deem Yasu as one of those places, where if you go, you need to,eat first and bring lots of money. But don't bother. It's awful. Just awful.",

    "text": "Recently, I have been to several major US cities, and in each one, I made it a point to find the best sushi I could, with varying degrees of success.  One of my friends asked me, \"Why haven't you found the best sushi in Phoenix?\"  Lack of urgency?  Needless to say, we began a quest to find the best sushi in Phoenix.  It will be an expensive quest.  And I think we started at the right place.  We started with the miso soup with clams.  If you want to imagine what miso soup with clam tastes like, imagine taking miso soup, and just adding clams.  I can't really think of any other way to describe it.  It's really that simple.  When the waitress took our order, we basically just went to town.  And everything was brought out, for the most part, one at a time.  This gave us time to enjoy each dish, and have a few minutes to think about it before the next item arrived.  The first dish we had was the ankimo, or steamed monkfish liver.  This delicacy is something I had in Denver, San Diego, and San Francisco.  Here, it was served without ponzu jelly, but otherwise similar.  The others in my party, who hadn't had ankimo before, liked it.  Next, we had hamachi carpaccio, which was a hit.  These perfectly garnished strips of yellowtail were one of the highlights of the night.  After that, we had yellowtail tartare.  This got mixed reactions; I'm not sure what they used in the flavoring, but I did like the spicy note that slowly builds up after you eat it.  We then had the amaebi sushi (shrimp), which was served in two stages: first, the main part of the body, peeled and raw; and finally, the head, deep-fried.  I had deep fried shrimp heads before, but it was a first for my two dining companions.  Really, the head is the most interesting part, and I would highly recommend anybody eating shrimp sushi to go ahead and ask for the fried head.  Next was brought out a whole fried european sea bass.  This was one of the most passable items for me; I usually prefer my fish to be served raw.  It was a nice change from everything else, but I probably won't order that one again... Or maybe I'm just bitter because the fish only had two eyeballs, and I didn't get one of them.  We then started on a rainbow roll, which the others ordered because they wanted to ensure we had something \"safe.\"  I ate a few pieces, but I never really get excited about rainbow rolls, or really any rolls.  Next they brought out the sushi: we had ocean trout, young yellowtail, and red snapper.  The waitress made sure to mention that they were served with garnishes and sauces, and were not meant to be dipped in additional sauce.  I liked that they were so serious about how the dishes are intended to be eaten; it really highlights the care they take in making the cuisine an actual art form, and not just something to stuff your face with.  My favorite of the three fish was the young yellowtail, but all were good (and fresh).  Afterwards, we had one more sushi item: the foie gras sushi.  It's really difficult to describe the taste of foie gras; it is distinct, but not overwhelming.  It was delicious, and making sushi out of it is an interesting concept.  For our last dish, we had the cook make us something of his choice.  He personally brought it to the table, and explained what it was.  He made us avocado tempura wrapped in see eel, with foie gras on top.  As if the meal wasn't already awesome enough, this totally elevated it to a new level.  It may make me a snob, but there's nothing I like more than having a piece of art made just for me, and having the artist personally unravel it.  If you have any appreciation of cuisine as an art form, this is clearly the place for you.  We finished our meal with the UFO dessert, which is a disc-shaped pastry stuffed with red bean and battered in tempura, and topped with ice cream.  It was pretty good.  Now, I have had some pretty good meals in my life, but if I were look back and consider which one was the very best, this one would definitely merit consideration.  It may not appeal to the fan of generic sushi rolls, but if you like trying new and interesting things, you're sure to find some potential here.  The quality of the food and of the menu is second to none, as far as sushi restaurants are concerned.",

I am irritated because 1. There aren't that many people there, why is it taking that long to make an albacore handroll 2. Quality Customer service doesn't exist anymore, they could have done something to compensate for their horrible service but didn't seem to care much!

We went on a Saturday night and it was pretty full. Customers ranged from families to couples out on date night. We were greeted immediately and the service was excellent. The server explained everything on the menu (there are a few different menu's) and offered his advice after asking what we were looking for to eat. The drinks were good and the food was fresh. The menu offers items you don't typically find at other sushi restaurants in the valley. The boneless ribs on the 5.00 menu were excellent as was the seafood fondue. The prices do get a little expensive with some items, so it is worth checking out during the times where they are running the food specials if you are really hungry. Overall a really nice and unexpected experience. We will be back again to eat there soon!",

I have been going regularly to Yasu's since they opened...the food is a little slow coming, but easily overlooked because it was so spectacular. Then last month my family and I arrived for a birthday dinner. Six of us (5 adults, one child). My daughter had made and brought a cake. The waiter said, \"That's an extra $25.00 plating fee.\" Not anything else. Easily I could see him saying, \"Not sure if you knew this but there is a plating fee...\" I was embarrassed at this greedy tact that the restaurant has taken. We took the cake to the car to be eaten later. Knowing it was a birthday, nothing was given to the birthday girl, not even a well wish. Last time they will see any of us there again, and believe me, I tell everyone I can about the poor service. Yasu is meticulous about the food, maybe he should be as diligent about the service!",

    "text": "Tonight was my second time dining at Yasu's. I was really excited to score a seat at the sushi bar, eagerly hoping to chat it up w/ the sushi chefs. However, they seemed too flustered w/ all the orders that they made a minimal attempt to talk to me besides asking, \"is everything ok?\" And I think the Mexican sushi chef is new so the Japanese sushi chef had to instruct him on certain things a few times.   I started off w/ an order of kampachi sushi, per one of the recommendations of the Japanese sushi chef. While it tasted fresh, it was very blah to me... nothing special about it at all.   A few minutes later, the waitress arrived to take my drink order. I decided to just stick w/ water and told her I was ready to order a few items off the paper menu. I had decided on mirugai (giant clam/geoduck) w/ mixed mushrooms, hamachi sashimi w/ jalapenos and ribeye sumibiyaki. First up was the hamachi sashimi w/ jalapeno slices. Nice thick slices of buttery hamachi, but all the seeds were scraped out of the jalapeno slices so they weren't packing much heat. After I ate them all, I remembered that there's a freakin recall on jalapenos in AZ and there wasn't a sign in the restaurant stating that their jalapenos are safe. JUST. EFFIN. GREAT. I hope I don't get salmonella. If you don't hear from me in a few days, pls call for help.. I live alone! And tell them, IT WAS THE JALAPENOS FROM YASU'S THAT DID ME IN!  Anyhow, next up was the mirugai w/ mixed mushrooms dish. Very small portion, but it was tasty. They were a bit skimpy on the mirugai to mushroom ratio so that was a little disappointing. About 10 minutes later, the waitress asks if I'm all done.. I ask her about the ribeye and she asked the sushi chef & kitchen in a frantic tone.. They reassured us it was almost ready. Another 10 mins later, it arrives.. I guess it was worth the wait.. it was soo tender I was able to \"cut\" off the fat w/ my chopsticks. DEEE-FREAKIN-LISH. It could have used a lil salt, but that's just me being picky. The 3 sweet dipping sauces helped. Next time, I wanna try the duck sumibiyaki.   Since I had a $50 gift card (that I purchased from the radio promos for $25), I had another $10 to use up so I ordered the shrimp skewers wrapped in crispy noodles. The crispy noodles were like deep fried chow mein noodles. Interesting, but good.   Stuffed like a pig, I paid and waddled out w/ my leftovers in tow.",

Then, with an already full belly, scarffed down the Green Tea Cheesecake Fondue without a second thought...Mmmmm, mmmmm...  The negative reviews about this place are anomalies, I am sure. And anyone who thinks this place is too expensive has been living in a third world country for the past decade.

The Toro and silky tofu was perfect.  The creamy tofu compliments the soy-flavored minced toro with spring onion. The kumomoto oysters were excellent - small, crunchy, and well flavored.  We asked Yasu to put a sashimi for us and he delivered well.  The sashimi slices were the most generous I've ever seen.  The tuna and yellowtail melted in my mouth and the giant clam was crunch and delish!  We also had baby yellowtail, sweet shrimp, red snapper, etc.  It was amazing!!  Next, we tried the robata grill.  What a treat it was!  Everything we ordered - black pork sausage, bacon wrapped asparagus, black cod, bacon wrapped grape tomatoes - was grilled perfectly.    Yasu has definitely won my heart and those of my coworkers too.  Keep up the good work Yasu-san!",

The patrons are as friendly as the staff and great recommendations for food came from both.  Its a well dressed up spot that has a trendiness all its own.  The reason it isn't a 5 star in my book is the sushi.  To be a 5 star in my book the sushi would have to be top tier in addition.

I was not disappointed.  Being a picky eater that has Izakayas at his disposal left and right, Yasu not only has friendly service, but also great ambiance, decor and food.  We started off with the fried tofu wrapped in Nori. The dashi broth was delicious. One of the better Agadashi Tofu dishes I have had.  Next we tried the king mushrooms. They were delicious.    The mushrooms had a great flavor and seasoning, and it was topped with tempura battered mini shrimp. Excellent dish! Highly recommended!  Next we had the Albacore Tataki Salad. The albacore was pretty fresh and nicely prepared, however I wasn't a fan of the dressing. A little too much vinegar and acid for my taste..  Finally we tried the Tonkatsu lunch special that came with salad and miso soup. Nice. Very good.  I was disappointed that they ran out of the black cod (one of my favorites at Izakayas) however I am sure it is absolutely delicious as well.  Please do come here for some pretty authentic Japanese bar/pub food! Great all around!",

The sauce was good though the eggplant could have used a little more seasoning.   We continued with the spicy tuna roll which all I can say is fresh, yummy, and spicy. We had a California roll and our new favorite - shrimp tempura roll. The sauce on that is decadent!   The order of terriyaki chicken was great too. It is dark meat served with a light sauce. The portion was very generous.  My daughter gobbled it up.   We finished the meal with pike fish. We originally wanted the snapper however they were out of it. The fish was served crispy, hot, and fresh.  A light sauce was at the bottom of the bowl.    The entire experience was great and we will be going back again!

    "text": "The fish is very fresh.  Lots of variety and specials to choose from.  The multiple menus could be a bit confusing, but it's not rocket science either.  Just a lot of information.  I'm okay with that.  Yasu-san has absolutely the best ankimo of anywhere I've ever been.  Very soft, topped with tobiko and negi in an ama-miso sauce that has been slightly spiked with yuzu.  Very good balance of flavors.  Stellar dish.  His bincho maguro was also very good with some fried garlic chips on top of it.  My disappointment came in a few aspects.  One, the \"Red Snapper\" (technically it's Japanese Red Sea Bream) carpaccio was a bit confusing.  Madai is a wonderful fish that I rarely get to have, but then it was overly smothered in oils and other sauces and hid the flavor of the fish.  I guess it's half my fault for ordering it carpaccio style though.  I should have known better  Second, the nori of the uni temaki and the vegetable maki where both very chewy and not crisp really at all.  Usually a really bad sign, but in this case, the rest of it was so good, I'm willing to overlook this a bit.  Third, I felt disconnected from the chefs as the sushi bar has an opaque barrier where you can't see anything going on back there.  It is one of the highlights of sushi for me when I get to watch the chefs work.  Yasu-san should not hide behind that barrier and instead share his skill with pride.  Fourth, one of my dishes had a chip out of it.  It's a pet peeve of mine in nicer establishments that sends a mixed message.  I almost wanted to give this place three stars for it's shortcomings, but it was such good quality fish, preparation, and service that I couldn't deny it another.",

    "text": "I would not return to this restaurant. First off you start your dining experience with 6 menus, and they aren't even nice, well thought out menus, they are printed on computer paper, stapled and dirty. They do not have descriptions of their rolls or drinks and it is unnecessary and confusing to have that many menus. Their prices seem reasonable until you realize how small the portions are. The taste wasn't bad but after a $50 tab, my guest and I left unsatisfied and still hungry. They have a $5 tapas menu which I tried the bacon wrapped dates off of. There were only 5 dates which tasted amazing but again, the portion was ridiculous. The same thing with the rolls, the caterpillar had great flavor but there were 8 slices of the smallest roll I've ever had and it cost $13. To top it off, service was extremely slow even though the restaurant wasn't very busy and my guest and I had to help a fellow customer in a wheelchair maneuver around their tiny restaurant. There are too many fantastic sushi places in the area to waste your time on this one.",

    "text": "The absolute best Japanese cuisine in Arizona.  Yasu is a tremendously creative chef.  He is amazingly skilled at textural/flavor combinations (try the ankimo -monkfish liver pate - with tempura avocado), and the service is  as wonderful as the food.  I recommended this place to everyone.  This is a True hidden gem in Phoenix.   I am shocked that I found such amazing and authentic Japanese cuisine in Phoenix (better than Nobu at the Teeter House, Roka Akor, Hana, ShinBay, and all of the other \"top tier\" Japanese restaurants in Phoenix, and as good as anything I have tasted in the U.S. or Japan).  You will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "OFFENSIVE. Tonight I had the most offensive and unprofessional experience at Yasu; I will never ever go back and I would only recommend it to someone I hate.  A group of four of us arrived at Yasu for our 6:30PM reservation and were seated promptly. We chatted for a while as water and other beverages were brought out and we went ahead and ordered the chef's choice menu so we could see the best of the best that Yasu had to offer. I've had great experiences with chef's choice at Yen, Pure, and a number of places in Boston so I expected the same from Yasu.  We entertain ourselves for a while until the first course arrives. 8 kumamoto oysters with uni and roe. Great play of textures and flavors. Kudos. Plates are removed and now we are getting excited, sashimi must be coming next and we are ready for it! The special fish selections of the day looked fantastic.  About 20 minutes goes by and we get our second course, red snapper carpaccio. it is seared and served at room temperature. One of my pieces had i don't know, tendon or something that made it unyielding to my chopsticks, and frankly, the temp of this dish was iffy. Flavors decent, but this is not the mass quantity of sashimi or nigiri I was anticipating.  The restaurant starts filling up. I see a massive plate of rolls come out of the kitchen and I nearly squeal with glee...until I watch it come to rest at another table.  This starts happening at a regular pace, and then I realize it's been a full 30 minutes since we've had anything at our table. A server comes by so I ask when the next dish will arrive. She mumbles something about the chef's choice taking a little longer than other orders and walks away.  Another cooked plate. A gross mushroom custard, a single shrimp on a skewer, an 1/8th of a cup of japanese eggplant in red miso sauce, a shard of spanish mackerel with some sort of puree, and two bits of jumbo clam. Everything tastes fine, but we are OVER the cooked plate situation.  Yet ANOTHER 30 minutes goes by. No server, nor manager comes to apologize for the delay. We watch literally dozens of delicious looking rolls, nigiri and sashimi fly out of the kitchen to other tables. We also watch 4 other couples come in after us, eat loads of food, and leave before us. We are still hungry.  Next course...Clams in miso broth. We are not offered spoons for the broth. We look at each other, thinking, \"we ARE at a sushi restaurant, are we not?\" but go ahead and eat the clams.  When the server comes by and asks how it is we tell her that we hope the next course will begin the actual SUSHI part of this dinner. She says yes, we are having live scallops.  About 25 more minutes pass and I'm starting to vibrate with righteous indignation. We are clearly paying a fucking fortune for this meal and we are receiving terrible treatment. The \"live scallops\" are boiling in miso broth over a mini-charcoal grill. They are so over-cooked they are RUBBERY. We hurry to get them off the coals and into our mouths before they are completely ruined.  Finally we tell the server that we are going to have to INSIST on getting some raw fish on the table. She says that's what's coming next. \"Next\" meaning ANOTHER 30 minutes later. We wait so long that finally we tell the server we are NOT going to continue with this absurdity and that we want the check. \"oh your next course is ready!\" \"we don't want it. We want to leave\" These are the exact words out of our mouths. Instead of bringing the check she brings the plates, telling us that Chef Yasu \"wants us to have them.\" We all resist and the plates are set down anyway and finally our hunger makes us cave and we eat. We have now been at Yasu for TWO AND A HALF HOURS. We've had five courses that were not enough for two people, much less four.  Another 15 minutes pass before the check arrives. In that time, the manager has come out, not to rectify the situation, or apologize, but to call us ignorant and classless. He literally looks at us and accuses, \"Have you ever had omakase before? It is always slower.\" We look at him and tell him in all of our sushi eating years we have never had an experience akin to this. We also point out that we were expecting SUSHI, as in RAW FISH. He tells us we told the server we would eat 'anything'. I asked him if the name of his restaurant was Yen SUSHI Bistro and he looks at me, puzzled. Then I see that we have been charged $20 for the last course that we TWICE tried to send back. I speak to the manager who tells me \"if Yasu wants to charge you for it, he will charge you for it.\" I kid you not. All in all each course was mercilessly over-worked, only average and Yasu is on a major ego trip. Don't waste your time and money here.",

Friday night date spot for my hubby and I, it's a bit small but wasn't terribly crowded last night. Had the bacon wrapped dates, ahi tuna, salmon sashimi to name a few items, all very good.  Really like the $5.00 tapas menu, allows you to try different foods at a reasonable price. Our waitress was very attentive and gave us good recommendation on trying some items since it was our first time in.  Definitely a return visit however I can see why there are some unfavorable reviews...it is very small so if they're busy I can see it being a problem...",

We are regulars here and can honestly say this is as fresh as you will get in the Phoenix area. Yasu flies most of his fish in from Japan & the quality of the dishes is apparent at first indulgent bite . Brian is usually our server and he always has great suggestions of what to try. On our last visit we had the Wakasagi tempura ( delicately fried small fish), tomato and edamame tempura , truffle mushroom soup, Asari miso, soft-shell crab & shimeji tempura , snake shiitake tapas, bistro green beans tapas & the trout carpaccio . Each of these dishes were more bright, fresh and delicious than the next. Yasu always has nightly specials and fresh selections and carpaccios ( our favorite) . If you haven't visited this sushi restaurant, give it a go... It's in a hidden spot in Paradise Valley, near the breakfast place\" Oink.\" Hope you enjoy it as much as we do!",

They either probably have no money or are expecting \"fast Japanese\" but they should know Chef Yasu FLIES in his fish EVERY day, and you can certainly tell the difference - so the people griping about availability or prep time just are plain ignorant when it comes to fine Sushi dining. They should stick  to their familiar \"American\" sushi in their favorite places like Sushi Station LOL.

Yasu, the genius who comes up with the menu items, is himself behind the sushi bar preparing the wonderful delights that pleasure your palate.   Try the pistachio salmon - raw salmon, rolled up and drizzled with hot chili oil, Japanese mayonnaise, and garnished with a delicate Japanese mint leaf, and topped with a pistachio. The flavors mingle and develop in perfect harmony in your mouth.   Pork belly in steam buns were amazing, as they are wrapped taco-style in a soft, delicious, Chinese steam bun wrap. If you like bacon, you'll love pork belly.   I can't get enough of this place. I actually want to try everything on the menu. This is hands-down the best sushi I have ever had, and I have eaten a lot of sushi in my lifetime so far.",

    "text": "A top 3 sushi joint in the greater phoenix area and may be tied for #1.  Yasu has yet to disappoint me with anything after a half dozen or so visits.   His level of experimentation and fearless approach to ingredients earns him big points.    If you have never gone \"omakase\" at a sushi joint before then this should be your first.  It's a slam dunk every time with Yasu and he always gets it together just right.    Only four sushi bar seats so you will likely be at a table.  This is normally a big deal for me because I think sushi should always be eaten at the bar.  Yasu's deals with it better than most and understands the delivery of table-side fish which must be fast.  Still I wish he would whack out the bar divider and expand the sushi bar to a good ten or so.  If you do happen to score the bar, you are in for a great night.     In general the place is warm and inviting.  The lighting is low and I think it's a great place for a date if this is your chow.   Parking can be a bummer and you can certainly drop some coin here if you eat like me... then again I can say that about most sushi joints.  Yasu's may be in the higher end of the cost spectrum though.",

They have the best and most knowledgeable service staff I have ever encountered.   Its a really small place and seating is limited. The times are limited as well. So you must work within those parameters to get in here, but believe me when I tell you its worth it, There is not one thing on the menu that I have ordered that wasn't mouthwatering Delicious!   Only downfall to this place is that the prices are very high and the portions are small. But, if you're willing to pay for amazing Japanese Cuisine then this is where to go. I prefer to pay a little more for something that I like rather than pay less and be disappointed. Food for thought!  Enjoy!  Arigato!",

There are quite a few other places in PHX that don't let you walk away hungry, serve excellent, fresh sushi and have a personable staff.  Yasu falls short on value and personable staff.

    "text": "Yasu, Yasu, Yasu..where do I begin? This has to be my favorite place to get sushi. I want to give you five stars, but don't don't feel as though your service deserves it! The food, and the sushi chefs deserve 10 stars in my opinion, but the service leaves a lot to be desired.   I was in for the millionth time last night for my mom's birthday. They were busy...but we only saw our server a few times. When she took our last plate and asked if we'd like anything else, I replied \"No.\" Apparently, I should have said, \"just the check,\" as we didn't see her for another ten minutes or so.   I do have to say in their defense, they have changed the server's uniforms, so they do look more upscale..which is something they were getting complaints about...so I know they are listening!   Now on to the positive..the shiso eel skewers may be the best thing I have ever eaten, I have turned many people onto them, including people I am not directly dining with! Just make sure you order them first, as they do take awhile to prepare. And the Red Roll (shrimp tempura with spicy tuna) is awesome.   I will continue to go back, but I am finding it harder and harder to bring new people there. I always warn them that if they are in a hurry, skip this place! If you're relaxing with friends or family, and not clock watching, and want some great sushi..this is the place for you!",

The food looks really good from the bar so far :)  Premium spicy tuna good. Lettuce was interesting. Not fully sure how i feel about it really, but the fish was very fresh. I think next time i would opt for the standard. They marinate at time of making so you can request a spicy level.  The salmon yuzu style was good. Great quality fish, perhaps a bit too much lemon juice. Was not overly seared which is a good thing.  The popcorn shrimp was good, not great. An interesting concept, and tasty but missing....something...maybe if it had been on a bed of wakame...yes that would have done it...maybe some grated lemon rind and grated serrano chili...?  The bacon wrapped scallops were good. Huge scallop, tasty bacon, well cooked. Simple and elegant. For me, i prefer them with some teriyaki, but i am a foreign-devil.  The kumamoto on a spoon. How can you go wrong! Well, they definitely didnt. That said, i changed up the second one...for the better for me at least. I pulled some of the daikon root off (about half) and a chopstick tip worth of the green and then added 2 drops of soy sauce and two chopstick tips of wasabi. Then it was amazing. The wasabi didnt take away from the oyster, but left an awesome after taste and the daikon no longer overpowered the wonders that are a kumamoto!  The duck was good. A bit plain, but very simple and tasty.  The hamachi with cilantro was derishous. Mayhaps my favorite thing i had  The sashimi was very fresh. The albacore stood out the most  The fuji apple desert was good. A great set of flavors. A great experience all in all.  You wont be disappointed here.  $$$ is about right. I ate for two at 120 bucks.",

While I'm not as committed to the quest as they are, I would be surprised if Yasu didn't rank among the top five sushi places in the Valley.  We had an incredible dining experience at Yasu. Our server was perfect: she definitely knew sushi and had many great recommendations. I'm still somewhat of a sushi novice, but you don't have to be a pro to know when you're eating a fresh, creative meal.  My recommendations: start off with miso soup with clams and try the hamachi carpaccio. At the end of the meal ask your server to have the chef make you something special. He made us tempura avocado wrapped in eel, topped with foie gras and served it to us personally. It was amazing.  Yasu provided one of the best dining experiences I've had all year.",

We were seated at the smallest table ever to be in a restaurant, I think the Guinness Book sticker was on the side of it.  2. Then we were handed two large \"book style\" menus, a sushi menu, a drink menu, and a sinner special menu.    Just shuffling all that paper made us a little crazy.  SIMPLIFY PEOPLE! 3. One of the items we order was brought to us on a plate that was so large that it hung over the side of the tiny table. Very dumb because there was no reason other than \"looking cool\" in the kitchen when they made it. 4. A little pricey for what you get.  The Good: 1. The bacon wrapped scallops (only 2 for $8.50) were awesome. The best I've ever had. 2. The waiter was very helpful with drink and food suggestions. (Keep in mind that he seemed to see we were having a tough time flipping through all FOUR menus.) 3. The Red roll was out of this world. 4. The place itself is as nice as your gonna find in any strip mall in AZ.  See, 4 good points and 4 not so good points.  This one is up to you to check out and see for yourself.",

You have to try their Sumibiyaki which are items cooked over Japanese charcoal, last time I was there I had the beef tongue..sounds weird but its so good  Nigiri/sashimi are a must.  They always have the best selection and daily special, most important...its always fresh...this is definately important!!  The sweet shrimp is my personal favorite and anything else you order, you will find the fish is sliced with great execution.    Request fresh chopped wasabi, you will never eat sushi with out it again!    Love this place!!",

Specifically, I live in Studio City; the home of sushi row, the land of sashimi wonderment and the prime pallate real estate that holds faves like Asanebo, Nozawa and Iroha. So imagine the pressure my co-worker, Gabi K, was under to find a sushi place worthy of my snobby and know-it-all sushi taste buds.  She chose Yasu and dammit, she chose well! I thoroughly enjoyed the tasty treats we had here last night and I would definitely come back if I lived here.   I really liked the hamachi with jalapeno. It was a little light on the ginger sauce, but still very good. We also tried the tuna carpaccio that mixed walnuts with it. Very different and very good. We also tried one of the featured scallop specials that was good, but a little too heavy on the scallions for my taste. I wanna taste the scallops and they got a little lost in the onion madness. We also tried the shishito peppers, good, but a really small portion and the eggplant. Oh and I can't forget to mention the miso-marinated black cod. Very deelish.  Definitely check it out. The atmosphere is nice and charming, the service is attentive and helpful and they serve a nice Pinot Grigio to boot. Good times :)",

    "text": "BEST FIVE STAR WALK-IN FIVE HOUR DINNER I'VE HAD IN AGES.  Even better than that? It's all thanks to you guys.  I started last Saturday wasting the first half of a great day outside trying to get my cell phone, which seemed to be dialing Mars on its own, fixed. The phone people near my place couldn't do anything, and sent me off to the PV Mall area to get it looked there instead. Long story short, many hours later, I ended up buying a new phone, and I hadn't eaten and drunk anything all day. Me in a starving and dehydrated state is not a great sight to behold.  It was almost 5 by the time my phone ordeal was all over, and I was going to head home to take a nap, but then I remembered seeing glowing Yelp reviews about some Japanese place nearby. However, I forgot the name and where it was located. But then I realized my new phone had web browsing, and after a few minutes of searching, Yelp led me to Yasu. Score!  Yasu is completely unassuming from the outside. I mean, it's in a strip mall a few doors down from a 7-Eleven and around the corner from Target. I walked in just as the doors opened at 5, with a quick sushi dinner all I was expecting to have.  I felt I was a little under dressed in my disheveled post-cell phone marathon state, but I decided to sit up at the corner bar where I got to know Ryan, the manager, and Yasu, the eponymous head chef. They're great folks - apparently Yasu the restaurant has become a local legend in the short time it's been open and reservations are strongly recommended - but these two didn't make me, Mr. Delirious In His Birkenstocks, feel any less of a patron. Even after I only ordered some rolls, nigiri and sashimi while completely disregarding the daily \"Specials From The Kitchen\" menu.   It was around this time that a couple sat up at the bar with me. They knew Ryan. They knew Yasu. I could tell that these two were regulars and they always sat up at the bar. Really friendly from the get-go, they ordered a great bottle of Sicilian wine and sent a glass my way (I already was doing well on a bottle of sake that Yasu recommended).  What did they order? They left it all up to Ryan to decide on everything. And of course that means things from the Specials from the Kitchen menu. I felt lame sitting there eating my sushi. Don't get me wrong. The quality of the fish was excellent. Much of it imported straight from Japan. Presented well and tasting better than any sushi I've had in Phoenix yet. But I soon realized that it wasn't why these two bar compatriots of mine came here.  Out came the mackerel tempura. My barmates were both full of compliments.   15 minutes later, out came the scallop carpaccio. This dish looked amazing, and again, talked about in nothing but superlatives.  I was really enjoying hanging out at the bar - watching what Ryan had Yasu concoct in the kitchen for his regulars - so much so that I didn't realize that the entire restaurant had filled out behind my back. The place was hopping!   By now, I'm engrossed in conversation with Ryan and the regulars (while watching the Sox make Scooby Snacks out of the Indians)....  Out comes a bowl of clams in garlic miso sauce.  My new friends each try one.   \"Hot damn!\" says one.   \"Oh wow. Oh WOW. Wow wow wow wow wow. Hey, give me your plate. You HAVE to try this,\" says the other.  Me? Sure!   WOW. and HOT DAMN.  That clam was incredible.   And that sauce was like serious crack.   Ryan: \"Don't you think once you're done with the clams, the sauce would be great soaked up in rice or sopped up with some French bread?\"  This guy is GOOD. And out comes a bowl of rice.  Followed by 100% Kobe medium rare sirloin with two dipping sauces.  Then comes some cobia (black king fish) pate.  Then comes the uni (sea urchin) with avocado.  Then comes the foie gras on marinated eggplant.   Each time something came, each time I partook. And each time I was more than impressed. How impressed? I've been eating sushi for eons, but I never thought I'd ever try uni. But I did this evening. And I really enjoyed it. Presentation on each and every dish was a work of art.  And each time my small cup of sake neared its end, Ryan, who had my bottle chilling on ice, would fill it back up again and put my bottle back to chill. And after it was done, I ordered a glass of that Sicilian red, because why not.  With my back to the restaurant, I was in my own world with the two regulars and the manager. Enough so that all of a sudden it was 10.   10.  I sat at a sushi bar for FIVE HOURS. Here I was, thinking I was just going to walk into some place next to Target to eat some quick sushi after ending up with a new phone.  And without Yelp, this wouldn't have happened.   So Megan, Jason, Nadia, MJ, Shannon, Adrian and Jim:  Thank You.  Maybe my phone was meant to die after all.  5 Stars.",

    "text": "Yasu is usually one of the best sushi restaurants I have ever had the pleasure of being in. It consistently wows, with inventive dishes and a definitive style that always have me wishing I was walking back in when I'm finally heading out. Yasu himself is charming and helpful and they have one wonderful, awesome waiter- an American with a suspiciously Japanese name who goes out of his way to help.   We did not get him.   On a Sunday at 7pm myself and 5 friends met for our reservation. We are all repeat customers. HEAVY repeat customers.   We ordered drinks and about the time they finally showed up, a cool 25 minutes later, we were informed they were all out of tuna.   Wrr? We all sighed and said... ok and ticked off an awful lot of other sushi options which we then turned in.  A few minutes later, our waitress (emphasis on the 'wait') returned and said that the wait was 35 minutes for sushi and would we care to order from the kitchen? We reluctantly said ok and placed a few orders.   So imagine our surprise when moments later our sushi began to arrive. Well. Sort of. Our waitress appeared with 3 uni shots instead of 6. All 6 of us eyed them, wondering who we'd have to take out to get one, and I calmly ask the waitress to retrieve our other uni shots \"expedited, perhaps\"?  Instead our waitress walked around the restaurant puzzedly WITH the uni shots like a nomad until she returned 5 minutes later to say there was no more uni.  A nice bunch, we all surrendered our shots until the three smartest amongst us grabbed them and then crowed about their taste.  The waitress offered us 3 oyster shots instead. They sucked.   So it was odd when oysters showed up WITH uni on them (though we should say we did order them with uni) a bit later. 5 of them. For the six of us. It is now an hour into our meal. We have already begun texting sweet republic, begging them to stay open. Or atleast bring us ice cream, because were hungry, damnit.   A process is established. Every 30 minutes or so a single dish of sushi or something arrives. We each eat one piece, compliment it, and then spend 30 minutes digesting. Halfway through a waiter or waitress will appear to let us know something we ordered is out. But they have \"everything else\".  We have stopped being quiet and are now openly hysterical. And hungry.  At some point management approaches and we instruct him to turn around and go away until he has good news.   They are out of our sake, but are happy to suggest another that is 3x the price. One of the diners suggests they comp it. He laughs. After three hours, all still a wee bit hungry, but 80$ poorer and without a glimmer of hope for sweet republic, we depart.   We've been comped nothing. Not an \"I'm sorry\". Not a \"hey, have some edamame on us\". Not a \"we've knocked 10% off the bill\".  We are a bit hysterical over the comical situation, but also not a little pissed. A 400$ bill for a bunch of regulars with a reservation?    Sigh.",

The employees were nice but the food I ordered wasn't good at all and I waited FOREVER.  There were only 2 other tables in there with customers, and a few at the sushi bar.  So total about 10 people including me.  I ordered dinner for myself, to go.  Chicken teriyaki and a sushi roll (I don't remember which one).  For just the 2 items, to do take out, it took over 25 mins.  I was shocked at the price as well.  I guess I wouldn't have minded paying what I did if the food was amazing, but when I got home and starting eating the food, I thought it was very boring, very bland and the chicken was very chewy.  I wouldn't recommend this place and I will not be going back.  Was pretty bummed since there are great reviews on here.  Maybe they were having an \"off\" day but there are plenty of other places around me to avoid this one.",

    "text": "AHHHH-MAAAZING. I totally feel justified in givin Yasu 5 stars, and judging by the reviews below me, many others agree as well.    Located right next to PV Mall in a small strip of about 5 other stores, Yasu was a pleaser all around. Service was prompt and very friendly, even though they are only open for lunch until 2p (they reopen later for dinner at 5) they still seated us at 1:30.  The interior is small, but PV trendy and unexpected.  First off, their Iced Green Tea tastes freshly brewed, rather than that  fake green tea taste I often encounter (refills on their hot tea, too!). We then tried 3 sushi rolls, including the absolute must have Power roll, a mix of avocadoes, tuna, and crab. We also had a tuna handroll and the Sun roll - non-baked scallops covered in sriracha sauce, which both were simple, but quite tasty. All ingredients were extremely fresh which made em extra yum.  Next, my sis had the Black Cod in a miso glaze. It was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was not lacking nor overpowering. This was one of the a la carte items, but if you are the type who needs a vegetable or rice, their menu is affordable so it's not a big deal. (Our bill was about $60 for 3 drinks, 3 sushis, a calamari app, and 2 meals). I had the Cold Duck Udon Noodles...sooooo yummy. I'm not used to eating udon cold, but it was a great change. Topped with mushrooms, nori, and a delicious sauce, I would recommend.   Their menu is pretty extensive for being such a small find, so I certainly want to try more and off their sumibiyaki menu. They also serve lunch specials that include a small miso soup and other sides. Can't believe it took me this long to try Yasu! It will definitely become a new fave.   Check out the New Times rave review (big time food critic of AZ Repub, Howard Seftel is also a huge fan of Yasu and why I wanted to first check it out) <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.phoenixnewtimes.com%2F2007-05-17%2Fdining%2Fraw-emotion%2F&s=49ea1500b68ed2d40d5a6866f0349288400b4ae782ba3b3d5df4fbacff2d5e9c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">phoenixnewtimes.com/2007...</a>",

    "text": "What a great surprise!  After eating at Nobuo the night before, we weren't really looking for more Japanese.  However, this was the closest restaurant to our hotel, so we went for it.   What a surprising and great meal.  We ordered bunch of food and loved pretty much everything.   Fois Gras sushi:  One of my favorite things ever.  Its simple, seared Fois Gras over rice served Nigiri style.  Love it.   Clams:  Not sure what this dish was called, but it was clams in a broth.  The flavor was amazing!  Yellowtail Collar/cheek:  PERFECT!!!  If you've never had cooked yellowtail collar, you need to.  It is the absolute greatest tasting fish I've ever had.  This was probably the best cooked collar I've tasted.   Pork Belly:  Awesome.  Of course, pork belly is awesome at any good restaurant.   Tuna Carpaccio:  A wonderful presentation of Tuna, sliced thin and served with seasonings and chopped veggies.  Marinated in oil, I believe.  Awesome.   Sushi:  We got a couple rolls, they were great.  \"Red\" roll, which is spicy tuna and Shrimp Tempure.  The other was a soft shell crab.   I'm forgetting some items, sadly, but it was AWESOME.  It's not cheap, but I loved the meal and would gladly go back.",

    "text": "I personally have no clue why the amazing reviews. For one they have 4 menus, its bizarre and unnessasarry. Then they like got one of the menus in off white with like highlighter print and you cant even see the writing. Dinner service is slow as it gets. It took me an hour and a half to get 2 rolls and the last time 2 hrs for like 3.   The fish itself is fresh, I had things there that were good and stuff that was not at all good. Whoever cuts the fish has no experience clearly. The slices are thick and cut in odd places. The scallop carrpaccio was realy good and the yellow tail carpaccio was kinda gross and in huge thick chunks.   If you can combine all four of your menus hire a few more servers or kitchen help, andtrain the dude who cuts blocks of fish this place has a solid foundation for success its just a few things that keep me un interested. If I was invited here by a friend I might come back but I would not reccomend or elect to come back with out influence.   I dont talk like that??",

    "text": "Yasu Sushi is porn for your taste buds.   I've wracked my brains for a fitting analogy and that's the closest I can come. (Pun intended.)   Today I had lunch here with a friend. Between the two of us, we had two rolls of tuna and salmon nigiri, a large bowl of miso soup, a salad, the most beautifully prepared grilled black cod glazed with some special exotic sauce I've ever tasted in my life, and a beef stir fry to top it all off. We basically stuffed our fat faces full of mind-blowing, top notch Japanese cooking, and what did the total bill come to? 39 stinking bucks, before tip.   That, folks, is obscene. It's a gross violation of any community's decency standards. It's so good you'll need to keep looking around to make sure no one's watching as you indulge. When the bill came (pun intended), I was reminded of when a buddy and I were little kids and discovered a secret stash of Playboy magazines in the park behind my house. As we devoured the delightful visions we'd never seen before with our rapacious, prepubescent eyes, we knew we had to get the hell out of there soon because surely this was too good to be True and some freak was going to pounce on us any minute. And so it is with Yasu, where I intend to come, and come, and come again as long as I can.",

Loved the tapas selection - we ate the green beans for an appetizer and they were really, really good. We both had two kinds of sushi and loved each of them. I'm coming here again, when my wallet is full. It was a bit pricey, but we knew that going in. I plan on getting sushi again and trying another couple rolls. The only annoying thing is that there's no explanation of the rolls anywhere, so you have to ask about each one if you're curious about ingredients. I'd recommend this place!",

    "text": "****Disclaimer**** There is no food review here, our experience was bad enough that we didn't even eat here.  It seems pretty consistent with other reviews that this place is pretty bi-polar with their service.  It's a shame because their food seems to come highly rated. ***End Disclaimer***  So after wanting to come here for a while now some friends and I were finally able to get in.  The first thing we noticed upon walking in was the strong bleach smell in the little are by the host/ess stand. We stood there for a couple minutes and the smell bothered me to the point of actually sneezing. We were finally seated after someone seemed to notice we were standing there.   Upon being seated we were given your standard issue sushi order sheet and some menus. Here's where the proverbial crap hit the fan. Their menu is comprised of item names only, with no descriptions at all. This wouldn't normally be a problem if half the items weren't given Japanese names. We waited 10 minutes before we were served drinks by not our server and she walked away. 5 minutes later she came back and asked if we were ready and we said we were having trouble deciphering the menu and she said ok and walked off instead of seeing if we needed help with something. When she came back 5 minutes later I asked if they had something that described the menu items and she said yes and went and got a bowl of sand with little clips holding business cards that held sushi descriptions.  And then left again.  They were for the 5 most expensive sushi rolls they had.   Finally she came back after a few minutes and we started to ask her about what stuff was. She answered some questions and then my vegetarian friend asked her about vegetarian choices other than the 3 things listed. She immediately recommended 2 items with bacon in the name to our friend's horror and then couldn't answer what sauces had fish in them as their menu had noted that some do.  She then left us yet again to make a choice.  We decided for our friend's own peace of mind, and my already annoyed attitude that we should probably just go eat at Eastwind where we knew they had awesome Sushi, Service, and Prices.  Now some might argue that it's our own fault that we aren't super sushi veterans and should already know what we are ordering, but it's my philosophy that you don't have to be an expert on something to enjoy it.  Especially not food.    I hate to give this place this low of a rating without even trying the food, but to waste a half hour or so before even really getting to the point where we could have had food being prepared is ridiculous.  On top of the fact that the waitress didn't seem too keen to help us figure out what the heck we were even ordering.",

    "text": "Delicious! We just came back from Japan a little while ago and wasn't sure if it'd meet expectations, but it sure did meet our tongue and stomach's expectations! :)   We enjoyed sitting at the sushi bar and catching with the friendly sushi chefs!  Whenever we come here, we always get the salmon wrapped seared rolls. (It's not your typical roll - there's veggies inside and then a piece of seared salmon on the outside topped with ponzu sauce.) I love it and have been looking forward to eating it for a while now.  Other new +'s we tried: Yasu Uni shooter - MUST TRY if you like uni/sea urchin. It has a good amount of uni, quail egg, and raw oyster. Totally melted in our mouths as we love all 3 things! and the sauce it came with matched perfectly! Beware though, if you don't like those things, you may not like, but if you do, you'll be in heaven!  Manila Clam Steamed (but in the special way - foil steamed) - it's light and tasty. After you're done, they use the leftover sauce and make a risotto for you. A plus since I loved the flavor of the sauce.  Halibut Carpaccio - so good it melted in our mouths!  We also tried the bay scallop tempura. I was in the mood for scallops, and the scallops were good. I'm not sure I love the scallops tempura-ed, but I didn't mind trying something new.   For veggies we had the green beans, which I liked a lot. The green beans is a good staple. We also got to try the snake shitake mushrooms. The concept was different and creative, and the taste was still good.   For dessert we had the special ice cream on top of roasted fuji apple, with nut in a wine sauce. That was really tasty! It hit the dessert spot!  They also have a new tapas menu to try smaller portions (at a very reasonable price). Lots looked enticing, but we had to pick and choose since we don't have bottomless stomachs! I must say, we made good choices and had good recommendations this recent visit. For sure no disappointments!  Service was attentive and friendly.   We always love coming here when we can! It's hard to find good Japanese restaurants around the PHX area. This is definitely on of the tops. I just wish they were a little closer to where we were. We'd probably go there more often if we weren't so far!",

    "text": "Before I start my review, here's a word of advice: Do not go to Yasu if you're short on time. It can be hard to get a table at this little place and the service is kind of slow.  That said, the food here is amazing! I love good sashimi, and the salmon sashimi here is delicious. The tuna is pretty good, too. My husband loves the Yasu roll, which is tasty but giant and therefore challenging to eat. All the rolls are good, but, in my opinion, if you're the kind of person who only likes sushi if the taste is covered up by spicy mayo and eel sauce, you might as well save your money and go someplace with low-quality fish.  The thing we really go to Yasu for is the black cod. You have not lived until you've tried this stuff! It's cooked in a buttery miso glaze that compliments the fish perfectly. I've had black cod and butterfish at other restaurants, but nothing has ever come close to the black cod at Yasu. This is a melt-in-your-mouth, little-slice-of-heaven kind of treat. We always order two when we make the long trek up from Mesa to eat at Yasu.",

    "text": "OK, my foodie friends...what follows is a description of one of my top 3 Restaurant meals, from last night at Yasu Sushi Bistro on Cactus and Tatum. Hands down the best sushi place in AZ.  We have been going there for about 5 years, but this is the first time we left it all in the hands of our Chef, Yasu Hashino and ordered Omakase. We sat at the sushi bar, and Chef seemed delighted to create a special experience for us... he asked if anything was off limits, only Uni I said. Sea Urchin is not my bag...but everything else was on the table.  We placed an order from his small, but exquisite wine list and picked a 2010 Byron Pinot Noir Santa Maria Valley.  All of his seafood is less than 24 hours old, flown to Phoenix from the Tokyo fish market daily.  What follows is a description of foodie heaven.... Yuzu Kanpachi - 6 perfect slices of baby yellowtail from Hawaii, finely slivered Japanese peppers and lemon, topped with ponzu. 6 fresh, briny, on ice fresh Coromandel oysters from New Zealand Ocean Trout Carpaccio - another delightful sashimi type dish of a fatty, fresh fish also from New Zealand  with a warm olive oil and slivered garlic chips and shaved daikon radish Mushroom salad with Yuzu vinaigrette - think lots warm mushrooms, shitake, enoki and shimeji on top of thin slices of celery and spinach tossed in delicious warm vinaigrette then topped with a handful of 18 year old shaved parmesan.  Wow.   Next was a bowl of steaming clams in a garlic & cilantro miso broth.  After we devoured the clams - Chef asked for the broth back and then made a creamy risotto to serve us. While waiting for the risotto, he served a tray of sliced fresh Albacore, which had been very lightly seared and thickly sliced served with sharp radish sprouts and garlic chips.  Tender and delicious, the Albacore is only at its peak 2 months of the year and it was so succulent! Then the risotto to prepare for the bamboo wrapped beef tongue.  Yes, beef tongue.  I didn't declare it off limits so that was fair game.  (And to be truthful, since I have never had it before I should not have been biased against it.)  The tongue is braised for 5 hours in a broth with ginger and green onion among other things I am sure.  Then it is sliced and topped with shaved green onion then placed on a bed of red miso and wrapped in bamboo leaf. The placed an a special hibachi grill and served.  I couldn't take it anymore and finally got out the camera. It was melt in your mouth tender and delicious.  Think braised short ribs without all the fat. Now after the risotto, we let him know we were getting full so only one more dish after the beef tongue.  Kathy's favorite dessert - and we always get this in some form when we go to Yasu.  Wait for it...Foie Gras.  And he made me a very special presentation - he said the world's most expensive lolly pop! (photo included) It wasn't really, but he took a large slice of Hudson Valley Fois Gras, seared it lightly and put on a stick.  Served with what I call Yasu special sauce (I have no idea what is in it, and he won't say but it's like crack) and a Japanese peach.  The best part.... I got one and Don got one too so I didn't have to share!!! Needless to say, it required more wine than just one bottle...but it was incredible.  Thank you Yasu-San!",

    "text": "I've been meaning to try this place for quite some time with friends, and we were finally able to make it out last night.  Disappointment is a good way to describe the mood of the evening.  I should note that we didn't actually order anything other than water, so this review does not contain anything about the food.  The experience was so unsatisfactory that we decided to leave for another restaurant.  I'm not against trying Yasu again, but I would prefer to go on a different night when perhaps the service would be better.  Upon entering, the strong and distinct smell of bleach attacked our noses.  That was off-putting enough; a restaurant should smell clean, but it should also not smell of cleaning solution, especially one rated as highly as Yasu.  It took a few minutes for the server to notice and seat us, which wasn't bothersome even as slow as the restaurant seemed.  The restaurant itself is incredibly small, with only a few tables and bar seats available.  The kitchen is readily visible from just about any seat in the house, which I find kind of fascinating.  The menu was the first of a few pitfalls.  It is simply a vague list of items, most of which are denoted by their Japanese names.  No descriptions.  I'm used to going to sushi restaurants and needing to ask for descriptions of their rolls,  but I've never been to a restaurant that did not at least attempt to describe their main menu items.  When we told our server that we were still attempting to \"decipher\" the menu when she came over to take our order (which seemed to take a really long time), she simply said \"okay\" and walked back to the kitchen.  I wish she had offered to help us decide what to get, but perhaps she was giving us our space.  At any rate, when she returned (after a lengthy chat with the other server working that evening), we had some questions for her.  Now, this is where the evening really started to go downhill.  Whereas both of my friends were able to obtain satisfactory answers as to what was in the menu items that piqued their interest (save the menu of sushi rolls, for which we were only provided descriptions for their five most expensive rolls), I was less than satisfied.    I kindly informed our server that I am a vegetarian, and asked if she could give an overview of what I could order.  She immediately looked to the grill portion of the menu, initially suggesting something with scallops but musing to herself that the bacon probably wouldn't work.  Thank goodness one of my friends piped in and informed her that being vegetarian meant that bacon was not an option, and this is where the server finally seemed to grasp what we were saying.  \"As in, just vegetables?\"  She sounded surprised that someone would choose to eat \"just vegetables\" on a daily basis.  At no restaurant have I ever been asked that question before when clearly stating my dietary needs, whether it's a McDonalds or a Fox Concepts Restaurant.  I expected something better from Yasu, which positions itself as a high end sushi restaurant in decor, ambiance, price, and menu selection.  A server should be aware of various dietary needs (not all, but the most popular certainly) and be able to recommend dishes that suit them without missing a beat.  That she could not was off-putting to begin with, but it managed to get worse.  She began hesitantly recommending dishes, but she was totally unsure as to what was actually in them.  A disclaimer on the menu disclosed that many sauces are made with fish oils, nuts, and soy, asking customers to disclose any allergies or dietary needs so the chef can accommodate them.  When pressed about the sauces for this very reason, the server was unable to tell me what was in any of them.  She thought the Japanese eggplant skewer had a flavored soy sauce with it, but had no idea what it was flavored with.  I further disclosed to her that I was allergic to shellfish (I've found that sometimes servers are more serious when dealing with allergies versus dietary \"choices\" such as vegetarianism or veganism), but that didn't help.  We ended up leaving to go to a restaurant that has a good selection of food for everyone, and we were happier for it.  To me, that level of service is unacceptable, and I haven't even detailed the time that we waited in between each server's visit to our table, but it was significant.  I feel that I should be able to go to a moderately high-end restaurant like this and feel confident that I won't order something that will make me sick.  I'm sure the food is stellar.  I just also happen to have minimum standards for service.",

    "text": "Worst. Sushi. Experience. EVER.  The food was bland. Okay, maybe they were going for something more 'traditional' which I get, and which I would *maybe* go back for. But the god awful service was a one way ticket out the door for me, never to return.   When my fiance and I walked in on a weeknight we noticed that the place wasn't very busy. We approached the hostess, and said \"Hi!\" and in return got nothing. Not a nod, not a glance, nothing. Thinking she didn't hear us (but could undoubtedly see us, as we were standing right in front of her) we said, \"Hi there, do you have a wait tonight\" (knowing they would not.) She glanced up, said, \"I'll be right back\" and left. When she came back, she grabbed two menus and told us to follow her. Wow, not even a smile- NOTHING.  By the way, when she left, the other hostess approached the stand and didn't acknowledge us at all either. What, are we lepers or something?   The server was slow, uninformed, and generally disinterested in being near our table (or near anyone else's.) She chatted busily and enthusiastically with other staff but couldn't be bothered to be asked for a water by me. Oh, sorry for 'bothering' you, but do you think I could get a refill? My glass had been empty the ENTIRE meal, even after asking her for more water.   We are tippers, I would never \"stiff\" someone after having been a server and bartender myself. That being said, I understand the flip side and having a bad night at work. But nobody there seemed to care that they were actually there to try and make some money or to be \"of service.\" This place sucked. I'll NEVER go back. If I wanted to be around some snobby waitstaff, I wouldn't go to a strip mall sushi venue located across the street from a mall. I would head to old town, and most certainly get better service and less attitude... which is saying quite a bit.",

    "text": "Visiting from Washington DC and this place was recommended by a local. This place was excellent on multiple levels. First, the service was definitely 5 star! Bryan, our server, was knowledgeable about every dish this place serves. His recommendations were based on his extensive experience with each dish and delicious. If you have ONE dish, make it the braised pork belly. Which brings me to the second reason I highly recommend Yasu. The sushi was fresh, clean, well prepared, served with excellent presentation and brought to me as prepared versus all at once. I appreciated this as the chef seemed to take pride in serving his dishes as freshly prepared as possible. As a Washington DC resident, I'm pretty particular about food and rarely write reviews. Based on my experience at Yasu, I am happy to recommend this place to anyone that enjoys quality sushi, service and presentation.",

    "text": "There are few places that I make a decision to NEVER step foot into again. Yasu has earned this dubious distinction from me.   First, let me give you my background with sushi since this came into question from the manager himself. I have been eating sushi for about 11 years. Some really bad sushi, some amazing sushi. I have mentioned in previous reviews that I have had sushi fresh off a boat in Hawaii. While I don't claim to have had ALL the sushi in the world, I know what good sushi and what good sushi service is.   Second, let me tell you that I have had omakase (chef's menu) in several locales, so I know what it entails.   I was with a group of friends on my highly anticipated visit to Yasu Sushi Bistro. We had made a reservation and were seated immediately. We quickly decided to indulge in the omakase menu. We wanted the best that Yasu Sushi Bistro had to offer! I always say \"Hit me with your best shot!\"   Well... if you have nothing to do, and aren't hungry...you should do the omakase menu. It took Thirty Minutes between courses. And please don't think we were given platters full of food. This is more like 2 small oysters per person, A plate of 1 shrimp, a couple slices of King Claim, a dollop of Spanish mackerel tartar on a bone chip.... So think tiny gourmet food. So think how hungry and irritated I was Two HOURS later. In a 3.5 hour visit, we had consumed Four tiny dishes. I really tried to be patient, but this is absurd and unacceptable! I finally asked for the check as we wanted to leave and go eat elsewhere. I expressed my displeasure at the slowness of the meal.   Now before you Yasu lovers roll your eyes and shake your fingers at me. Let me put it in perspective. At ANY restaurant, it is unacceptable to be the first table to arrive, watch subsequent tables seated, and fed, and watch them leave and you're still waiting to be fed... you would be ticked off too. Now add to that a condescending manager who comes over to talk to you and asks if you have ever had an omakase experience before and tries to piss in your pocket and tell you that it's raining. Unacceptable. Now, add to that the restaurant sending out another dish after you had already asked for the check and then CHARGING you for that dish even though you said you didn't want the dish.   I have nothing against the food, though it wasn't very imaginative on the SUSHI level. What killed the entire visit was the slowness of the courses, the response of the management, and the lack of ethical treatment in regards to the check.   I will never visit Yasu Sushi again and I bet my stress level will be all the better for it.",

The first night, we ordered everything the waitress recommended. I don't remember all of the names, but the items that stood out were the:  green beans - really good sauce! beef tongue - if you've never tried it, yasu is a good place to start! tuna carpaccio - DELICIOUS!! Came back a second time for this one! Really fresh and really great flavors. Red snapper carpaccio - also good, but if you're going to try one, do the tuna carpaccio. Yasu roll - The only roll I remember. It was good. The other rolls were good, but none really stood out to me.  My recommendation, try the carpaccio. You'll be hooked and never want to order anything else here!",

He takes so much pride in his food and always wants to make sure you leave happy and have a stellar experience.  Sit at the bar if you are adventurous and want the chef to send dishes out to you. This is by far the best sushi experience in Arizona hands down.  I don't rate a place based on their staff or service but as a bonus their staff are friendly, very knowledgeable and so passionate about the menu and the items. The chef must do a great job making them taste everything. Give this place a try. You will thank me later.",

The sauces and flavors Yasu put together were delicious. Yasu the owner came out and greeted our table and personally thanked us for coming. That's unheard of now a days.

Our waiter was attentive and knew the menu well.  He made great suggestions were were always very helpful to our ordering.  We ordered a few items off of their special menu as well as the Bistro cold udon (amazing!).

The menu is more than a bit complicated. I believe there were actually six of them this Friday evening. That's half the fun and where a helpful waiter comes into play. Since a majority of our party had never been to the restaurant, we opted to share numerous small items to sample the menu. Many were ordered on the recommendation of our waiter. We were not disappointed. Interestingly, the bistro green beans tapas was my favorite dish (I was traumatized early in life by too many middle school cafeteria green beans, so green beans are never preference of mine). Or were the pork belly buns my favorite? Or the shrimp tempura udon? Can't decide.   Highest praise came from my daughter, the one who lived in NYC for a year. She stated, \"this reminds me of my favorite NYC sushi spot.\"   I greatly appreciated the helpful waiter who showed no impatience with our illogical ordering process or our preference for water (there goes the big tip in many waiter's eyes) as our beverage. We tipped him as though we had all ordered cocktails.  The location, wedged between a Subway and a Circle K, doesn't impress. But open the restaurant door and you'll be rewarded. Reservations suggested if you are going at a peak time.",

Someone was smoking pot inside using a vape with children nearby .We were waiting on our green bean to arrive after about 30 min of watching Everyone receive their dishes we were able to get our servers attn and ask if re green beans were coming out she gave a blank stare like she had forgot to put it in. She came back 10 min later and said the cooks had lost our ticket and the rest of the food should come out in a bit. Five minutes later all of our food arrived at once no biggie we were hungry what was not ok is the Nigiri yellowtail came out and was more had 50% bloodline ? We've ordered this dish many times and never had it come out looking so disgusting and couldn't believe a chef would think this was ok to send out. The calamari was tough & some pieces inedible but other bites were very good. We flagged our server down to ask her for the check and explained that the yellow tail was inedible and asked if she could remove that from bill and she said no ? Shocked because of all the other issues you would think they would have had no problem removing it. We said that's fine just the check then and that took another 20 min to get we left disappointed and still hungry after paying a $60 tab . I use to love and recommend this place but sadly we will not return again after the awful service and quality of food.",

    "text": "What a total disappointment.  We arrived at 6 pm. There are about 10 tables in the restaurant and we were among the first few since they had opened only at 5:30 pm. This is what we ordered:  Bay Scallop Tempura Skewers Beef Short Ribs (both are \"tapas) Gyoza Skewers Ikura Nigiri Bistro Cold Udon Two bowls of rice Lamb Chop Hamachi Kama  It wasn't a huge order and mostly small plates. Here's the problem--after 90 minutes, yes one and half hours, we still hadn't received our order of lamb chop or hamachi kama! And the server was sadly unable to care, stating, \"Well, our menu does say it can take 45 minute to an hour to receive your order.\" Ok, maybe--but again, it was 90 minutes and the other food came out so sporadically as if we were having a seven-course meal. [first the short ribs, then 10 minutes later, the ikura. Then 10 minutes later, the scallops and gyoza skewers and then the udon. Then we just WAITED and WAITED for the other dishes that never came.] Our server claimed the chef makes everything in the order that it's received. Huh? That doesn't make any sense. Again, maybe that's what he/she does--but (1) that's how fast-food restaurants cook, not \"bistros\" and (2) if that was the case, we should've have received our food much faster than the table next to us that arrived later, ordered more food (and drank an entire bottle of wine between the two of them) and left before we ever received the lamb chop or hamachi kama.  Sadly, we saw the chef/owner Yasu Hashino hanging around in plain clothes (guess he wasn't cooking tonight) at the sushi bar chatting it up with his regulars. Not one glance over at us, even when it was apparent we were unhappy and had told the hostess and server to just cancel the lamb chop and hamachi kama.   Taste-wise, I'd say the food was decent but I've had much better in San Francisco and Honolulu. This place is just over-priced and over-hyped. The dashi with the cold udon was flavorless and the short ribs were too chewy. I would love to tell you how the hamachi kama was (one of my favorite Japanese dishes) but unfortunately we never go to try it. Also, the green tea is $2.50 per cup and NOT refillable. I guess in order to be a \"bistro\" you have to have fancy matcha and not even offer a refill of hot water. The server said it was an expensive tea and thus no refills. I asked if she had any \"less expensive\" green tea but alas no more tea for us.   I'm unsure why this place has four stars. I can say that the terrible service and lack of concern for our failed dinner led to the final one star rating. I was really looking forward to a delicious Japanese dinner with my father and daughter. I suppose it might have earned 2 1/2 to 3 stars if we hadn't been treated so poorly. Our busser was quite attentive--I'd definitely give him a star.   I do not live in town (not currently, but I did grow up here and lived for 30 years prior), so maybe since there are few quality Japanese restaurants in Phoenix, this one passes with 4 stars. Overall, I would say don't waste your money here--find a good Mexican seafood restaurant instead.",

I am surprised at their quality to cook this fish. In addition their tempura should be one of the best tempura in US because actually they were not flitter but completely tempura like Japan. But we ordered shoju named Kaido, at that time they filled only one finger depth on the glass with 9 dollars. They should improve volume of shoju if they would get better reputation than current situation.",

    "text": "Yasu far exceeded my expectations. Reading the reviews on Yelp I expected the food to be good but I didn't expect it to be THIS good!  We went on a Saturday night. It was busy but we only had to wait maybe 10 minutes for a table. Our waiter came over and gave us a nice overview of the various menus and recommended how to order. Here's what we got:  Green Beans: holy amazing green beans, batman. Whatever this sauce is, it's fantastic. And the crispy garlic - so good. These are probably the best green beans I've ever had. I could eat these every day.  Pork Belly Buns: If you like bacon - get these. Crispy salty pork belly bacon on a soft little bun. And I meant soft. Like pillow soft.   Crispy Salmon Skin Salad: This was the only disappointment of the meal. There was barely any salmon skin on the salad and too much cucumber. Compared to everything else this feel short for both of us.  Nigiri: We chose the tuna and the yasu-style salmon. The tuna was melt-in-your-mouth good. Some of the best tuna I've ever eaten. The salmon was also fantastic.  Tamago: To round out our meal we ended with tamago, which is like a thin egg omelet layered on top of rice. I've had mediocre tamago and this was above average for sure. Light and fluffy with just a hint of sweetness. The perfect was to end the night.  I'm so happy we found this place - a hidden gem for sure. I can't wait to try other items on the menu.",

The chief is innovative and a True artist in he kitchen and on the Sushi bar.... This is a place where you get what you pay for and not anything like you would pick up at the Fry's Sushi bar. It is fresh, and incredible tasting food.  We had the Bento box today and found it nice! I normally enjoy kasuzuke black cod and they do a version of miso kasuzuke black cod that is to die for when you take the first bite. Absolutely the best tasting fish in the world! If you have never had it, you must do it and you will know why it is also called sable fish....and if you like fresh Uni, this is the place.... nothing like it is all of Phoenix AZ...  Enjoy!",

We arrived and because we had no reservation had a 30 minute wait, which was fine.  When seated it was a cramped little area where by me sitting it left no space for anyone to walk behind me and they'd have to go around a section of the dining area.    Water served was just barely cooler than room temperature and we had to ask for ice.  When tea was served my BF asked for some sugar and they seemed shocked, they don't have sugar in packets so brought a little dish with sugar and then no spoon or stirrer so he used his chopsticks to stir tea.   Our server didn't come around very often, we had to flag her down for refill or anything else.   The food itself was fine but nothing spectacular for the $101 bill.  The cucumber salad was a disappointment with the cucumbers texture being odd, not enough dressing/seasoning and no sesame seeds like in other places so it needed something for the texture .  Everything else was mediocre for the level you'd expect .   It wasn't any better that the people seated behind us had a conversation loudly about the girl's Botox, her pedicures, her feet, and then the man breaking down their bill discussing every item listed and its cost down to the penny. We won't be back.",

Their servers are always prompt, attentive and efficient.   I only eat sashimi, and their cuts are much LESS generous than the other sushi places I patronize (the most generous being Akai Hana and Moto). In fact, I think the cuts have shrunk over the years.   Also, if a server gets an order wrong, the owner makes them pay out-of-pocket for it, plus does NOT let them eat it after they do so. It goes in the garbage. How douche-y is that?",

I had the seared toro nigiri which was full of flavor highly recommended. I tried the salmon wraps which werent what i expected but still tasted good. My friend ordered the Northern Pike which was slightly fishy but had a great texture to it and tasted great. I also had the oysters on ice which came out ice cold and very fresh and tasty. Everything is a la carte here and can get a little pricey after all the sake an sapporo ; )  I highly recommend to anyone that wants really fresh sushi. Be prepared to wait as the food can take awhile for preperation but it is well worth it. They do a good job of brining the food out slowly so you never have a ton of stuff on your table at once.",

    "text": "We've been in Yasu numerous times and their food quality and services were consistently excellent.  We love their great sushi selections (blue fin tuna, live shrimp, etc).  Their fish are very fresh and flavorful.  If you are adventurous, this is a great sushi place for you!  Some of the best kept secret about Yaus is their charcoal grill.  We fall in love with their grilled whole black snapper, grilled whole Hokke (Atka Mackerel), and grilled whole squid.  Whenever you order anything from the grill, you better be patient.  But your patience will pay off.  The food absorbs so much flavor from the charcoal and it is so moist as it cooked slowly over the grill.  Our flavorite table in the house is at the sushi bar.  The sushi chefs are friendly, interactive, and informative.  We asked their recommendation each time and never disappointed.  Trust me, the food is so good here that we drive 6 hours each way to dine at Yasu once a month.",

    "text": "This is for sushi lovers: my friend and I were looking for good sushi takeout on our way home and decided on this place based on the overall good Yelp reviews. The hostess was friendly and when I asked if we could just sit at the bar and order our takeout then leave she said that would be fine. That's when things went downhill. I had to nearly tackle a waitress to order. Both of us ordered sushi and she said it would take 20-30 minutes. Not great but ok I can deal with that so we ordered drinks. From the time we sat at the bar to when received our food it was 1 hour..... 1 hour! For sushi. The other big problem I had was that my salmon nigiri (raw) was placed on the back wall in front of me and wasn't given to me for 10-15 more minutes before I asked the waitress what the holdup was. Mind you, there was also no apology for the longer than expected wait, nothing. But At this point I'm starving so I ate the sushi- let's pray I don't get sick. The salmon nigiri was good and their \"special\" roll of the day was spicy salmon roll which was ok at best. This was the worst sushi experience I've had and believe me I've had many. The consistent vibe I got brig there was they didn't want us there. I would never go here, they are extremely short staffed, don't seem to have the slightest clue about customer service and overall mediocre food.",

We would say the 4.8 out of 5 Zagat food score rating Yasu has received is what we'd also rate it.  It's a small restaurant, maybe 13 tables and a few seats at the sushi bar. But the food, chef, music and clientele make Yasu the sushi restaurant we're willing to pay a little extra for. The strip mall location isn't bad. They're making the best of it.  The menu is very extensive. Our server was knowledgeable and steered us in the direction of wow factor dishes that we just loved.  9/18/2016 Update: When you make a reservation, they say they'll get back to you. That doesn't happen. Also, I made a reservation yesterday morning for last night. They should have updated their machine to show they're closed for a few days. Maybe minor issues, maybe indicators of more serious problems.",

I have only tried a few of the items, but they were great and you can't beat the price!    The nigiri sushi at Yasu is wonderful.  My absolute favorite is the albacore.  It is to-die-for!  The albacore slices are topped with dried (or fried?) garlic and onion then a light sauce is poured over the top.  You have to try it to understand.  The spicy tuna hand rolls are another winner.  Plenty of fishy goodness, and some rice, bursting out of the nori cone.   If you like Tobiko order the \"premium\" spicy tuna, but be sure to nix the romaine lettuce.  It overpowers and adulterates the tuna and Tobiko flavors I love so much. The specialty rolls are good, but there aren't many to choose from.  Also, the roll ingredients aren't listed on the sushi order sheet...or anywhere else for that matter.  It is a pain to have to flag down a server to ask what's in a Phoenix or Sun roll.    My major disappointment here is lack of a real sushi bar.  There is a bar, but you can't really see what the chefs are making nor can you call out your order to the chefs.  One of my favorite things about sushi restaurants is drinking and getting chummy with the chefs at the bar.  Not gonna happen here...  All in all, a great place to grab some sushi.",

The sushi was incredible, so fresh and it actually took a bit of time, so you know the sushi chefs are meticulous about detail and presentation and it definitely showed! The prices are a little on the higher side. The nigiri is $8 for the tuna and I really think it should be around $6. Our server was very nice and attentive but never hovered or came over too often. And every time someone is leaving the restaurant all the employees say \"arigato\",  and it was just a nice touch to end the evening. It's nice to acknowledge your customers as they leave; I feel restaurants should do this more often! Will definitely be back!!",

Also, it includes a note that says \"table preparation may take up to 45 minutes.\" I can understand when you're understaffed, but would a restaurant owner plan it that way purposefully?  -the host, for a few reasons: We came in and she said there would be a wait. She didn't take our name down on a waiting           list \"unless we weren't going to stay and I'll gladly take your phone number.\" We waited outside and noticed 2 or 3 tables empty but with table toppers on them, assuming they were reserved.   When the inside waiting area emptied we went in, and our hostess said, \"Is your third person here? Would you like to wait at the table for them?\" What???

It's a little far from home, so it won't be a regular stop, but when we're planning to be in the Paradise Valley area, we will certainly make reservations to dine here. Who would have thought, in the dead of summer, at 5:30 pm they would have no inside table available? Okay, granted it is a small restaurant, but like a previous reviewer, I found the ambiance and decor inside lovely. They also have fantastic background music, at least on this night . . . a nice mix of jazz (Diana Krall) and standards.   Because they had no available tables inside so we opted to sit outside on this sultry evening. There are no misters on the patio, but the little discomfort did not take anything away from the fabulous meal we ordered.   They have a great tapas menu which gives diners and newbies like us a chance to taste a multitude of items at what I would consider very reasonable prices. (There has to be another word in Japanese instead of the Spanish tapas to use instead.) They also had \"happy hour\" drinks for $5, so we each had a Shochu cocktail - his with cranberry, mine a mix of cranberry and grapefruit. Refreshing!   We started with the Red Snapper sushi - OMG, it melted in my mouth. It was so fresh. I could have ordered more and just made this my meal . . . the best red snapper I have tasted bar none . . . including Tokyo!   A total hit was the Bistro Green Beans which were flash-fried (no breading) and had a melding of incredible flavors. The beans were so fresh and cooked to perfection with a little snap in each bite. I have had this dish, or similar ones, at other Asian restaurants, and what set Yasu's apart was that it was not oily or greasy.   The shrimp noodle skewers were more a novelty than a great choice. Minced shrimp, skewered and then encircled with an abundance of noodles wrapped around them was the only disappointing item we had. Too much noodle to get to the shrimp. I deconstructed the noodle on my plate to get to a bite of shrimp.   The Snake Shiitake was delicious! It was actually fun to eat as well. It has nothing to do with snake . . . the shiitake is cut up into long pieces which resemble snakes. Very creative naming . . .   One of my other favorites is the shrimp stuffed Japanese eggplant. (I am an eggplant lover.) The slightly sweet miso sauce was yummy, and the eggplant tender.   I was full at that point, but my dear hubby had to order one more item, the special roll of the day . . . spicy yellowtail. Beautiful! The yellowtail was so fresh, and the spice just gave it flavor but did not overpower the fish at all. Some sushi places forget that the real star of the roll is the fish and put the emphasis on the spice. Not Yasu!   A comment on the service . . . our server Liz was top-notch. She answered all our menu questions and made excellent recommendations. She was friendly and attentive. When we go back, we will undoubtedly ask to be seated at her table.   One more thing . . . there are lots of veggies on the menu so if you are a die-hard vegetarian like so many of my friends, you will be able to have a great meal here, too.",

We're already planning the next dinner and haven't stopped thinking about it since.  Fairly pricy for Phoenix standards but inexpensive compared to similar quality sushi restaurants elsewhere.",

Since I had no reservation and was on the patio after a bit of a fuss, and with the tiki torches blowing their smoky fumes and ash in our general direction, I was not prepared to make the investment that this place demands. It could also have been when the giant pink Mary Kay Cadillac pulled up; not even the Caddy keys could get them a table.

Finding great sushi in the valley is an overwhelming challenge, so I am relieved to finally have a default place to go for amazing sushi.  The menus were giant, so our waiter took care of us.  We asked him to just bring food, and that he did!    We had several courses, the first of which was a sashimi tuna, cut from the belly; it was very rich in fat which makes it just melt in your mouth, served with freshly made wasabi, followed by a beautifully prepared salmon with an amazing ponzu dipping sauce (we took them up on their offer to fry the remaining head and bring it back), we had incredible little lamb ribs which came served with little japanese fruits, kobe beef (I think they call it something else) which blew my mind.  It was the most tender thing I've ever tasted, even more so than some baby birds I've nursed back to health.  We had foie gras on top of roasted eggplant with a kind of sweet savory sauce, this mollified any hesitation I had about eating foie gras.  It was simply \"heaven.\" (T. Danson) Our meal was punctuated by two bottles of sake so milky white, it reminded me of a pair of young women's legs.  I have not had a better meal since.  I solemnly swear to return to my sushi mecca.    I enjoyed that the chef or owner (someone in charge) was out in the dining room explaining everything to us, and checking up.  I never see that these days, and it's a really nice touch that sets this restaurant apart.  The service was amazing too.  Our waiter was on top of everything and so were the bussers.  Simply \"heaven!\"",

Everything was clean tasting and delicious.  Especially noteworthy was the sea trout, which you don't see very often.  The very lightly seared hirame and the yellowtail carpaccio were both so light and mild that the experience was almost like eating clouds.  Perhaps most importantly, the rice was outstanding.  It was a perfect foil for the fish in the nigiri.  The sushi bar is interesting in that it is small and the fish is hidden by an opaque screen.  At a lesser restaurant this would bother me but they are so good here that it's excusable.  I guess they don't want you to see the magic happening!",

I grew up in Tokyo and also live in San Francisco and while it doesn't compare, it's a step up for Phoenix. Just lose the attitude. You're in Phoenix.",

Totally amazing!  Our only complaint was the music.  Every song had the same drum beat which struck us like \"water torture\" might be like.  And the bass in the stereo system was turned up high so it was more intense.  We are sure there are folks who might enjoy this music.  When my husband quietly went up to our waitress and expressed that we might want to change our order to a take out one, she was so concerned and make an effort to turn it down.  It helped a lot.

    "text": "My husband and I went to Yasu about a week ago. It's the first Japanese restaurant we've tried since we moved to Phoenix about a month ago - we decided to go based on the stellar Yelp reviews and were definitely not disappointed. I can't give Yasu all five stars because some of the hot dishes we tried were not as flavorful as we had hoped (based on the reviews and the prices!), but we found the sushi and other fish dishes to be really fresh and flavorful, the service to be attentive, and the overall vibe to be trendy but laid-back. We started with two rolls - Spicy Yellowtail (~$7) and the Phoenix (shrimp tempura) (~$9) - which were both perfect. The rice was the right consistency (not too sticky or soggy) and the fish was fresher than most we've had in California, let alone the desert. At the recommendation of our server, we tried the octopus carpaccio, one of the daily specials, and fell in love. The octopus was sweet and tender and topped with a delicious sauce and sliced jalapenos. Next, another special (the miso eggplant) arrived and it was amazing - tender with a sweet and incredibly flavorful brown sauce. Up until this point, we were in love with everything about our Yasu experience. The next two dishes were a little disappointing. The rib-eye steak that everyone raved about was pretty much just that - rib-eye steak. It wasn't that tender and it didn't have much flavor besides that of the grill. The dipping sauces were good but didn't really make up for how inherently standard the steak tasted. The shrimp fondue dish was also disappointing - it was basically just shrimp covered in batter that you dipped in boiling sweet and sour sauce. The shrimp tasted frozen and the whole dish just felt a little forced. However, these two dishes aside, we loved Yasu for the fresh sushi (which is probably harder to find that good Asian-inspired steak), the amazing octopus and eggplant, and the good service. We would definitely go back.",

I know, blasphemy).... anyways, for me this place had such a great mix of traditional sushi, japanese grill (there is fancy name for it but I can't remember), small cooked plates, and some cool creative dishes like red snapper carpaccio (it was my fav).  The tuna tataki was really good too - we got it \"salad style\", and I loved it ..... also the garlic miso clams were ridiculous.  We had the waiter bring us a couple bowls of white rice just to soak up the pool of deliciousness that was the leftover sauce.... yum!  My friends really liked the shashimi they got - esp. the hamachi, and I tried a piece of albacore that was really good as well.  And don't get me started on the dessert - the green tea cheesecake was phenomenal - so creamy and tangy... I wanted to take it home with me and sleep with it under my pillow.  Yes, I clearly have issues.  We also got the green tea tiramisu, which I wasn't as big a fan of.... missing that same \"oomph\" that the cheesecake had.  Bottom line, this place is 'BOMB!",

The waitrons are good with them. Although there is no child's menu, there are things on the regular menu a child will enjoy. My 6-year-old, for instance, loves the katsu chicken! I have no problem with it in a strip mall. In my experience, some of the finest restaurants ever have been in the  most unusual places.",

    "text": "I cannot describe the excitement that I felt when I found such decadent sumibiyaki cooking here in the valley.  I would definitely call this place an eatery.  It is small, cozy, friendly, very japanese-ish, and yet still very metropolitan and hip.  The menu font annoyed the crap out of me (i  know...weird but you'll see what I mean)....but I just LOVED that they had a dedicated section to the sumibiyaki grill dishes.  My favorite of the evening included the following ... respectively... Beef Tongue (it was heaven), whole baby squid, the Kobe version of Chicken (be aware: chicken will never taste the same), the Hoke fish (fish of the day) and the bacon wrapped tomatoes.  Bacon wrapped scallops were WAY over cooked and tasted like chewing on an eraser off a No. 2 pencil.  I'm sure it was an over-sight and I woud give it a try again.  I didnt' get the feel that sushi was the chef's forte, but then again, it's not everyday that you see Aji (Spanish Mackerel) on the sushi menu.  I got the Aji sashimi and was completely blown away and was more than satisfied.  Just like I had remembered from other sushi restaurants, it was rich, yet not fishy at all, flavorful in ways only Aji could be, and of course that recognizable sweet after taste.  *rolling eyes backwards* it was JUST deeeeelicious!!!  The service is also definitely worth yelping about.  Service was insightful, genuine, and real.  You actually get the feeling that they are excited about the food there and they care about the food or tongue you're about t ingest.  :-P  This place has earned a top 3 spot in my book.  I'm SO glad I found this place.  IT IS A MUST TRY!!!",

Menu changed slightly over the year but the food was always consistent.  This place is small and I always feel crowded as space between tables are not that much, that is probably a main reason I don't come here more often.  I had chocolate souffle for desert. I think their ice cream was homemade.  The yamamomo (Japanese wild peach or Myrica rubra) was so sour, it complemented sweet ice cream and chocolate souffle. Yamamomo left a nice after taste.  In a way, it was balanced like yin and yang, sweet desert with sour yamamomo.  On this particular day, I had chirashi for my meal. It was good, but great. I like to order chirashi from any sushi restaurant as it comes with variety of fish and other food, and it is easy way to evaluate the quality of ingredients they use. Their chirashi wasn't the best I've ever had, but they were good. I would order again.",

It often involves a fair number of cooked meats but we've been with a vegetarian (who ate fish) and it wasn't a problem at all. This is the type of meal where each dish suddenly becomes the best one of the night. On our last visit I think the salmon cheek was the highlight but it's tough to choose. There's a scallop in Parmesan sauce that's always amazing, and fried mackerel skeleton is incredible! Our server has always been lovely and is very good at explaining each dish. We usually wind up spending $100-200 a person, so not an everyday meal, but worth every penny! (And you can always order off menu to control cost as well.)",

Service was good but felt like the portion was small for the price.  Lunch specials ranging from $10-16.

    "text": "I've been to Phoenix a few times on business travel. When I do fly out for a job, I like to eat fairly well. This place came highly recommended by my sister, who was a pastry chef at the Bourbon Steakhouse. She's eaten here a number of times and loved it. Since she's Miss Picky Eater, I took her suggestion to heart and came here on my last night in town.  I was not disappointed.  I arrived in time for happy hour. I was able to grab a few drinks and a seat at the sushi bar. It was an honor to have Chef Yasu see to all my dining needs. He provided excellent suggestions.   I ordered the ankimo monk fish liver, ocean trout nigiri, Japanese snapper nigiri, cream scallop, bistro green beans and the bistro albacore tuna. My favorites were the ankimo, ocean trout, bistro albore tuna and the red snapper nigiri. I was SUPER pleasantly surprised with the snapper. Past experience gave me the expectation that a red snapper is one of the more tougher fishes for me to eat, especially with that bit of tendon that never gets removed. Chef Yasu proved that it could, in fact, be soft, tasty AND delicious.   If you couldn't tell, I stuffed myself silly.  In the end, Chef Yasu and I swapped dining recommendations. Him for Phoenix and me for San Diego. I look forward to my next trip out. Another visit for me at Yasu. Can't wait!",

    "text": "Based on the reviews we decided to try this place since we don't live far from the restaurant.  We were surprised at how small the place is, but it is a nice intimate place.  We walked in on a dinner rush so had to wait. The hostess was either inexperienced or was just awkward.  She didn't quite know how to address the issue of the restaurant being busy and that we had to wait, and it was almost like the more she tried to explain the deeper of a hole she dug.  We almost didn't stay, but we did, and so that was fine.   A table became available and instead of sitting us to the table, she went into the kitchen to grab food for tables, so that was another few minutes we had to wait.  Finally sat down, and to our surprise, we only got one menu.  No big deal, but it was odd.  our server came over fairly quickly and took care of us.  It was going well.  We liked what they offered on the menu although we think they can spend some $$ to make the menu look nicer...I mean in some kind of cover would look good, instead, we had 3 pieces of paper - menu (fresh and different every day according to the server), drinks list, and I can't remember what the 3rd piece of paper was. The food was great and definitely fresh, on the saltier side so we all drank a lot of water.  Service was pretty good..by this time the place had slowed down. One last thing that happened which I think would rely on the training or maybe common sense...we were going to order additional items, and our server had a couple of checks in his had to take to his other tables.  Instead of attend to us (we were still in process of ordering and eating), he told us he would be back in a few minutes and went on to give the checks..one of the tables was talking to the manager while our server look on.  To me, that was backwards service.  He should have come to us first to see what we wanted to order so he could ring it in and then drop off the check to the tables.  In this case, I believe the table that was talking to the manager had an issue or issues with food or service, and our server was there for at least 5 minutes before he was able to come back to us. I think we would give it another try before we have our final verdict of the place.",

    "text": "TL:DR- Worst sushi meal of all time. $175+ per person for omakase. Nearly no sushi served. Ponzu spilled all over me. Got horrible food poisoning. Nothing on bill was comped despite our constant displeasure.  I went here for my birthday dinner and it was absolutely the worst and most disappointing omakase experience of my life. We called ahead for reservations and to confirm that Yasu would be able to serve omakase. We asked for seats at the bar, which they said couldn't be reserved, but would be accommodated on a first come first serve. No problem, we got there right when it opened.   We arrive at the restaurant and there is nobody there. We ask to be seated at the sushi bar like we talked about and the woman up front said that they were unable to accommodate. Huh? First come first serve and we are the first and only people here on a tuesday. Hostess says,\"Sorry, some of Yasu's friends will be dining here tonight and we have reserved the bar for them.\" OK? We called 30 minutes before our reservation as we were leaving the house and they said it wouldn't be a problem if we showed up early. Apparently people willing to pay $200 per person on their Birthday are still treated as second-rate diners. Who knew? To finish off that thought, Yasu's friends who took up the first come first serve bar showed up an hour and a half after us and it was just two of them. Obviously enough to lock down the whole bar.   On to the food. One word- HORRIBLE. Absolutely the worst sushi meal that I have ever had. I have been to probably thousands of sushi meals and dined at many of the top sushi places in the US. I would rather have gone to a revolving sushi bar with smelly fish. At least you know what you're getting into from the start there. The fact that I paid over $550 for three people wasn't even my issue. The food was seriously disgusting and the service did not make up for it.  Having been to Yasu before, we asked if they could add the Yasu-style Salmon to our omakase order as it was one of our favorite. They said yes or Yasu would make something like it. 12 courses later, not a single piece of nigiri sushi had come out, despite our constant pleading. There was almost no sushi served except for two sashimi-style courses. All of the sushi was doused in so much sauce, it made me think I was at a revolving sushi bar restaurant and not at a high-end Japanese restaurant. In all cases, the sauces were incredibly overpowering. It made me think that the fish was not fresh as I can't imagine any other reason to hide the flavor of the fish that much.  Aside from the fact that almost no raw fish was served, the cooked dishes were not good. They served fried smelt fish that were completely bland and greasy. It was very frustrating as we kept asking our server for more nigiri/sashimi and he kept saying he would talk to Yasu. It never came. We were openly telling our waiter how disappointed in the food we were every time especially offensive dishes came out. Don't worry, nothing was taken off the bill.   Service was OK. One of the servers clearing my plate spilled an entire plate full of ponzu sauce in my lap on my brand new jeans that I got for my birthday. I wasn't joking about the amount of sauce on each dish. At least two cups of ponzu went into my lap after the plate was cleared.   Overall, my experience at Yasu was disgraceful at best. Every part of it was riddled with issues. Totally unacceptable at any price point, but absolutely deplorable for this price. Despite all our complaints, neither Yasu or anyone from management came out to talk to us. Nothing comped. No apologies. Absolutely the worst sushi meal of my life and quite possibly the worst meal of my life, period. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO TO LITERALLY ANY OTHER RESTAURANT ON THE PLANET. Icing on the cake: GOT HORRIBLE FOOD POISONING FROM THIS MEAL.",

    "text": "FANTASTIC!!! I love sushi and have had a difficult time finding great sushi since moving to AZ! This isn't your typical California roll place, but everything I had this evening was amazing. The chef has a serious passion for what he does and it shows in ever dish. He takes care to fly in fresh fish all week and adds new dishes on the menu for what is in season. If you enjoy food and the experience of trying new food this is a place for you. Go with an open mind, listen to the suggestions of the waitress, chef and eat what is in season and you will not be disappointed!  What I recommend: Seasonal tuna from San Diego (only in season for another 6weeks) Green beans Hamachi carpaccio  Double spicy tuna roll   Sit at the bar and interact with the chef, he won't steer you wrong and you will experience how much he loves what he does and how much he wants you to enjoy it too!",

Found out about this place from Phx magazine and the sushi chef at AJ's fine foods supermarket @ Dana Park and it was as good or even better than they described it!  my favorite was the sea trout carpaccio (On my 1st visit). On my second visit to this place I took the advise of our server who told us we should sit at the bar next time and try the \"chef's Choice\", so I did and it was outstanding ! we did 7 courses and left there satisfied but not over stuffed and very pleased with every single course. In two words: quality and creativity. Will certainly be returning to this place soon.   PS. If you consider california rolls real sushi this is NOT a place for you - go somewhere else!",

    "text": "After about 5 visits to Yasu, I have decided to give them four stars.  The food there very good.  They have a wide variety of items ranging from tempura, to robata to sushi and other grilled fish and pork belly, which is commonly cooked in Asian homes, but hard to find in restaurants.  The food is always prepared very well.  I've had  a variety of grilled fish.  Most recently we had a grilled black snapper.  It was done to perfection.  The tempura is very good - the batter is perfect in consistency, not too thick, not too thin.  The sushi is also very good - a bit plain, but fresh.  They do have the yasu salmon sushi which is a seared salmon with a ponzu sauce on top.  It is one Yasu's more creative sushi's but in the overall scheme of creative sushi, its nothing to write home about.    I also like the beer selection here.  They serve Orion and Ichigo.  Ichigo is a rice beer that is very hard to find.  Sake selection is just OK.  Yasu's weakest point is the waitstaff and the service.  I have to agree with many yelpers that the service is mediocre at best.  For this reason,  I deducted a full star.  The waitstaff are not very well trained for the caliber of restaurant that Yasu is trying to be.  If you are the type of person that wants service pronto, this is not the place to visit.  However, if you want a relaxing evening and have time for a long dinner, I would recommend Yasu.",

If you want all you can eat sushi, or sushi on a belt, or a bargain, Yasu is NOT for you. Explore his menu. His servers have in-depth knowledge. Explore the menu.

Must have: shrimp fondue.  It is a delightful appetizer that is shrimp, wrapped in mint leaf, and then covered with a fried wonton.  It is served on a skewer with a dipping sauce. Absolutely orgasmic!!   Delightful.    Edamame is nothing special.  Just so so.   The shrimp tempura roll is out of this world; the soft-shell crab roll was a bit fishy for my liking.  I really didn't care for it.    It's a good place with a wide variety.  Downfall: no explanation/description of rolls so unless you are a sushi pro (which I, admittedly, am not) you will be asking a lot of questions.

    "text": "This is a great hidden gem in a very unassuming location, surely worth a visit, even if it is in a pretty scary strip mall next to a circle k and target across from PV mall.  Kudos to them for transforming the former Yoshi's fast food into a very small, but quaint, little restaurant.  Dimly lit, cramped, but nicely done interior, with AMAZING FOOD!  We ordered a slew of items...  Our FAVES: Chicken karange, a soy ginger infused chicken morsels deep fried and covered in a curried egg salad.   The lamb!! For $5, you get a mouthwatering, juicy, melt-in-your mouth slice of lamb served with some crispy shaved vegetables. I forget what the server told us they were, but they were very good.  Lamb was perfectly cooked, and had an insanely rich flavor.   All the sushi is fresh and delectable. We had ours with the fresh wasabi which just puts it over the top for me.   Corn flake shrimp and bacon wrapped scallops were just okay.  There was a lot of great reviews on them both, so we ordered them and were not overtly impressed.  The shrimps were plump and juicy, but were definitely overpowered by the giant chunks of greasy cornflakes that violated the roof of your mouth when biting into them.  These also came with an egg salad on the side which made the dish heavier than i would have hoped for. I would have liked to see a lighter dipping sauce? Spicy mango? Something slightly sweet or tangy?  Scallops were cooked perfectly, but the surrounding bacon was not as crisp as I would assume it would be. So the whole texture was just soft scallop and chewy half cooked bacon...Not my thing I guess.   We also ordered the teriyaki chicken, which by then, we were SO full, we barely touched it, even though it was delicious. It was an all dark meat chicken, not my fiance's favorite, but it was still good.  We took it home and ate it the next day.  I made a nice chicken fried rice out of it.    As a side note, I thought the portions were going to be micro after reading all the reviews.  Those people must be used to eating at buffets or maybe they frequent Claim Jumper? We ordered way too much food and taking an entire entree home, AND it was less than $100 AND we ate a ton of SASHIMI.  Of course we did only have tea and not alcohol.  They have a great $5 dollar menu that has a lot of little goodies on it as well.  It's really not expensive at all.   I do agree that the service is a little lacking.  We were unfortunate and got stuck with a 'fresh' one that had someone following to make sure he didn't royally screw things up too much.  He was a scared little puppy and we tried not to be annoyed with him because he was nice after all.  It may as well been his first day.    We will be back for lamb! YUMMY!",

Then he came and said \"you want Avocado on the side???\" I said \"yes\" he says \"you don't like avocado?\" I said \"no\" and he says \"oh. Just take it out then\"  what the heck?????? I've never heard of someone making a mistake on my order then telling me a simple \"just take it out\"  I'm such a picky eater that I don't even want avocado touching anything but my sister who was with me, LOVES avocado so that's why I asked for it to be on the side!!!!   To make matters worst, I asked him if I can have a knife so I can cut the roll in half and let me sister eat the side with avocado... He hands me a chop stick thing with a sharp edge.  Omg. I give up. I just can't take it anymore. Poor service. Instead of remaking the roll or giving us a 10% off our bill or something.  Worst sushi place ever. It's because of places like this...

The menu has a lot to offer, and what we had was pretty fresh. Our servers were also very friendly.  Our main issues are: 1. The food was somewhat overpriced. They had a few items that were inexpensive ($5 items, and the California rolls are just $5). Some of the rolls were way too expensive though, and the tempura was also pretty pricey. 2. We were there in a group - some of our food came out extremely fast, and some came out very slowly. It made it a bit awkward when we finally had to eat because our food was going to get cold.  All in all, we would return, but at those prices, we would probably wait until we are really craving sushi. It is definitely one of the better sushi places we have eaten at in Phoenix though.",

We almost had the taxi keep driving and go somewhere else.  Luckily we didn't. It is a very small place, but very warm and cozy and romantic as well. We had exceptional service the entire night and great sushi dishes! We went off the recommendations of our waitress and loved everything.   We went with the tapas style menu, with smaller portions, and had 5-6 different dishes. I don't remember the names of all of the dishes we tried, but most were raw sushi with light sauces, absolutely delicious! Then the last one was a hot seafood plate with shrimp, clams, squid, etc. THEN they take the sauce left, after we finished the plate, back into the kitchen to make a small dish of risotto with it and served it to us...Perfection!  One negative comment. I love seaweed salad and they only serve the kind with mostly cucumbers. I was very dissappointed, as I do not like cucumbers, and getting the salad without the cucumbers was not an option.   We would absolutely go back here, though, and eat again.",

    "text": "Yasu continues to deliver all these years... my very favorite place for sushi and sumibiyaki.  What you should not pass up at Yasu: Red Roll Premium Spicy Tuna Roll the Lamb Bacon wrapped Scallops  I am not big into lamb, but this lamb is amazing!  It is prepared over a charcoal fire called sumibiyaki.  You can also smell it burning in the parking lot and the smell alone is enough to drive you nuts.  I did not know what sumibiyaki was prior to visiting Yasu.  It is grilled food prepared over high end Japanese charcoal called binchotan. (Who knew?!)  There is a whole menu prepared this way and I think everyone needs to try it.    The Premium Spicy Tuna Roll is like no other I have ever had before.  I dream of the heat and texture that just melts in your mouth, making you wish there were more than 5 pieces.  The glory of sushi is you can always just order more and nobody thinks you are a piggy... it's expected.   Yasu is a nice quaint restaurant perfect for a date or gathering with good friends, seating is intimate and the staff is attentive and friendly.  I think I need to make eating here a weekly event.",

I really like the attention they pay to small details ... the dishes they use are very Japanese and you can just feel the quality. (I have a collection of japanese dishes, and I can tell these aren't cheap stuff) and they place a little rock for each seat they set up for placing the chopsticks ... very zen in a way ... dig it totally  There are wide variety of selection in this restaurant, not only your typical sushi but also variety of hot authentic japanese dishes from the grill (way beyond teriyaki). Ordered the hamachi kama ... oh so yummm ...  In term of sushi, they are good but not wow ... I would recommend this place for their grill and hot dishes instead ...",

Nothing incredibly egregious or offensive, just seriously slow and inconsistent.  If they decide to make your orders quickly it all comes at once (fine for us, but not always ideal).  But, if they decide to put you on the back-burner, forget about it - you're there all night for no apparent reason.  It took us a while to realize that this will never get better (probably 20-25 dinners over 2 years), so we just got tired of trying to figure this out.  Large tips, friendly conversations with servers, simple orders ... none of that helped  - they're just poorly organized.",

I am a big seafood lover and there a lot of \"chain sushi\" places in Arizona that are decent and good for rolls, but if you want quality and authentic Japanese style fish and incredible Sashimi, you need to go to Yasu. There is really no way to describe it till you go, but once you do, you will become an instatnt fan!  Best thing to do is sit at the sushi bar and ask Yasu to make whatever he wants! You won't be disappointed.  The area and building are misleading... However, if you are the kind of person that thinks RA is the best thing since sliced bread and nothing can beat it, this is probably not for you. This is real sushi... Go try and enjoy!",

After being charged $54 for 2 rolls and a few pieces of sushi, I had high expectations. The rolls were bland and flavorless. They used crab sticks instead of fresh crab in the rolls. And the sushi pieces still had flakes of skin on the edges.  They have $$$ as the price range, but it should really only be $ or $$ to be generous. I paid for fancy napkins and nice furniture apparently, cause the quality and taste was definitely not worth $$$. I won't be going back.",

    "text": "When we visit AZ, this is one of our top places to hit! It never disappoints.  We arrived promptly at 5:30 to avoid the evening rush, and were seated immediately. The place did not fill up while we were there, so this seems to be a good time to go on a Saturday night. We had our 11m old with us, and they provided us with a high chair, and were great at picking up things that he accidentally (for the most part) dropped.   When we visit Yasu, we make sure we order our favorite - tuna carpaccio, and then try some new things based on the suggestions of the ever-helpful server - tonight it was: Yuzu style red snapper sashimi, a Yasu specialty salmon sashimi, a salmon hand roll, and green beans. We also like to order a few things off the sushi menu, we ordered the yellow tail nigiri and were going to order the salmon sashimi (from the sushi menu), but the waiter suggested the Yasu style salmon nigiri instead - it was a great recommendation!  Our food came out steadily, we were just finishing one plate when another came along. There was a slight delay on the 2 items that were Yasu specialties - it seemed that everyone was ordering them, and he was \"slammed.\" I was a little nervous when the server said there would be a wait - child was getting sleepy/clingy, but we waited maybe 5 minutes.   My husband liked everything - he is the major sushi fan, I am the sidekick. I have a super sensitive fishy taste bud, and I noticed both the salmon hand roll and the yellow tail tasted fishy. Husband thought they were, \"Nice!\" We both agreed that the salmon sashimi (had a pistachio on top, wrapped around a green - we can't remember the name) and the tuna carpaccio were our favorites.   About the only very slight negative I can think of has no relation to the food: no baby changing station in the bathroom. (This is not a surprise, very few good ethnic food restaurants have them, I've found.) But the bathroom was clean, good sized, and single person, so I changed the babe on the floor then used baby wipes to clean him up.",

The front of the house can get very backed up and on a recent evening that happened again to us. WE waited over 2 hours and 15 minutes to get a scallop appetizer salad. We had thought they forgot and we were getting ready to leave, when it came out. We tasted it and it tasted like cooking fuel--a definitely tainted toxic taste, so we returned it to the chef and said to just take it off the bill.  He refused ! It was not edible, and after an otherwise perfectly fine albeit, slow and expensive ,meal was ruined because he chose to keep the 9.99 app on the bill, even though we waited 2 hours, and it was not palatable. After having spent thousands of dollars at this place, we are done for good. The arrogance was unnerving !",

The incredible green beans came out first and were just as fabulous as other reviewers have noted- perfectly cooked slightly al dente with incredible flavor. Everyone enjoyed the tapas so much that we kept on sharing plates with the rolls and the delicious shrimp stuffed eggplant, which was as good as it was beautiful!  The standouts were the green beans, scallop skewers and the Yasu roll. The only dish that didn't live up to the rest was the cornflake shrimp.    Almost forgot to mention the yummy grapefruit cocktail, i think it was a  cocktail- definitely worth trying! Our server JR was friendly, attentive, efficient and good with the kids.

I believe it better cooked than the Colorado Lamb at Andre'$$$ at the Monte Carlo in Vegas however it was seasoned differently. The black cod was great as well but the miso glaze slightly overpowered the cod but again, cooked perfectly.  Your bill is commensurate to the quantity of menus.",

First the positives: the service is very attentive, friendly and helpful. Our waitress was very nice and helped us to sort through the menu. Secondly, we did have some really tasty dishes. The ocean trout carpaccio, albacore salad, and nigiri that we ordered were all delicious and had some unique flavors.   Now for a few negatives. The prices were a bit high for us. I think this is because we're from California where there is sushi all over so prices are naturally lower. Either way, our bill was higher than we were expecting. Secondly, the rolls we ordered we not spectacular. Compared to the nigiri and other dishes we had they were even downright mediocre. Kind of strange considering the rest of the meal was delicious.   Overall, however, I would recommend this restaurant. Good food and friendly service. Would be excellent for a date or dinner out with friends too.",

The wait staff were very friendly and attentive. They have very unique Japanese tapas. We ordered combo sushi dinner plate, green beans and Brussels sprouts tapas, and miso clams. All were delicious. The reason I didn't give 5 stars was due to Russell sprouts being over cooked and salty. I probably would order again though because it had good flavor and the Brussels sprouts with bacon bits and pistachios went well together. The green beans were excellent but again bit too salty. Lastly, the clams took 35 minutes...way too long given we were their first customers. They were yummy though; worth the wait. They offered risotto for the broth from the clams but we were running late to a show, so maybe next time.",

It has an air and environment of intimacy, because the restaurant is small, and dimly lit, so it gives the impression of being a hole in the wall. However, you still get the high end sushi experience, as the food and dishes severed are so delicious and complex. This is a wonderful place for date nights, because of the intimate setting and amazing food. But I wouldn't recommend it for louder celebrations like birthdays or graduations. Yasu is one of the best sushi stops in the valley! Take a visit if you're a lover of Japanese cuisine!",

The menu had a lot of choices and we ordered a variety of sushi and beer to drink. All was very good and came out spaced appropriately apart. My friends even talked me into desert which was interesting. The best description i can give is a fried pita bread with ice cream inside.  The service was a little slow that night but I really did not mind as we were in no hurry, the place was not busy, and the people were very nice. The restaurant was clean though I did not use the bathroom facilities so I cannot comment on that one. The place is located in a strip mall so there is ample parking available. If you are looking for sushi and a nice quiet place (at least on a Tuesday night) this would be a very good choice.",

We had to flag someone down to get wasabi and dishes. 20 minutes later we said just cancel the tapas and bring us our rolls.     The rolls were fine. Nothing special, but I've probably had better from the grocery store. The portions are very small.

We ordered drinks Kirin beer and tangerine lime cocktail. The beer wasn't cold and I wasn't impressed with the cocktail it was tasteless. I asked for a cold sake instead and waiter said I can't take the cocktail off the bill! ( never heard of it anywhere )I said it's fine . The food came ( premium shrimp roll and yakisoba , the roll was very simple and I barely saw shrimp( it was grounded) in it, and yakisoba! We ordered to go since it was too hot and our bad we didn't check the container , we came home and it was burnt!!! I can't believe our bill came to $65 for an appetizer a roll and 1 burnt entree and an unwanted drink ! We called the restaurant and the manager exactly said \"this is what it is\"  this is my first review on yelp , and I already feel so bad to start off w a bad review but I didn't want this to happen to anyone else. Definitely we won't go back and I make sure to tell anyone I know to stay away from this place.",

It's sort of tucked away, it's next to a Subway, so sometimes it's easy to miss, but if you like sushi and delicious flavors, then you definitely went to step in.   Be sure to call ahead with a reservation! The restaurant is small and you can find yourself waiting, but it's worth it.   Valerie is usually my server. She's wonderful. My boyfriend and I make any excuse we can to get to Yasu. It's our favorite restaurant. I'm not usually a \"we\" or \"our\" person, but that's just how this situation ended up. And thank god because it means we always agree when it comes to going to Yasu. Did I ask them if they cater parties, or maybe even weddings? Maybe I did. Okay I did. (PS They do.)  We always order a bunch a plates but our #1 staple is the steamed pork bun. Just do it. Don't think about it. My friend once told me she would \"literally die\" if she didn't go to Europe once a year and I was like, lady I have no concept of that. But now that I've had the steamed pork buns at Yasu, I sort of understand. I'd probably die if I didn't eat them once a month. I think about them at least once a day.  Try sitting at the sushi bar when you go. It's so fun to talk to chef and learn what fish you should order that day. I guarantee you won't be disappointed.",

Service was very good. Our server was sweet and helpful.  We shared the green beans, miso eggplant,  and avocado roll. Additionally my husband had scallop tempura skewers and the salmon roll. The green beans were phenomenal. I could eat them all day. Eggplant was also very good as well as the avocado roll. Hubby loved his scallops and liked the salmon roll except for how TINY it was.  The only reason we might not return on a regular basis is because of the portion sizes and the prices. The eggplant was around $10. I was expecting a plate full not a tiny bowl full. $40 worth of food and my husband and I were hungry an hour later. I understand that this is a \"tapas\" place but this is definitely not somewhere to go when you are watching your budget.   But if you do have a little money to burn and you want to experience some delicious morsels of joy prepared by an obviously talented chef, I highly recomend Yasu.",

We tried close to 10 different items each one was astounding. Aside from the green beans I recommend the Branzino if they have it. The fish falls away from the bones and it is savory. The gyoza skewers is yummy and a family favorite and the shrimp stuffed eggplant is phenom. The reason they aren't getting 5 stars is we waited...are you ready for it- over 90 minutes for our food. Everything was slowly and painfully delivered over about a 40 minute time frame- in no reasonable order- and then we had to wait even another 20 minutes for two remaining vegetable dishes. The waitress is awesome and friendly but does not know how to handle a disastrous kitchen. Next time I have 4 hours on my hand - I will certainly come again. Maybe, just maybe- those green beans might make me forget!",

The humble signage would lead you to believe this is just any generic sushi place in the city but is anything but generic.   This is the first Japanese restaurant that I've found here thats tested the boundaries of what people expect from a sushi restaurant. Its ballsy menu includes some things you absolutely wont find anywhere else.   The owner watches the restaurant behind the sushi bar unafraid to get his hands dirty. I think the owner / head chef Yasu himself has made this restaurant what it is. Theres attention to detail in the food and the service that only an owner could instill. The menu is not only creative, but smart, whimsical and savory.   The price can be a bit high but the introduction of a new happy hour structure has made it affordable to get a taste, but look out, after a taste you'll be coming back for more.   This place is great if your looking for something different, dates, happy hour, or special occassions.   One of the BEST restaurants in food and service I've been to in Phoenix hands down.",

We both are a bit adventurous, so we decided to skip sushi and head straight for the Japanese specialties. we started with a delicious plate of Kumamoto oysters. They were served raw, on the half shell with a nice, light ponzu-type sauce that complemented the sweet, ocean flavors of the oyster.   Other highlights were definitely the char-grilled whole black snapper as well as the aji, spanish mackerel. The black snapper came out first (food is served as it becomes ready). It was perfectly cooked and picked up wonderful flavors from the grill. The skin was crispy and added a nice layer to the seafood. I tapped into my inner Anthony Bourdain and sampled both the cheeks and eyes of the fish, which was served head-on. Cheeks were so good: very tender and sweet. I'll probably skip the eyes next time as they did nothing for me.   Next was the Aji, which was served sashimi style with the head, tail and spine on the place. The server instructed us, in very broken English, that when we were done with the meat, they would deep fry the rest (head, tail, bones) and we could eat that, too. I wasn't sure I heard her correctly, but low and behold, when we finished with the amazing sashimi, she collected the remains and about 5 minutes later, returned with a plate of fried fish carcass. Our eyes lit up and we dove in, pulling off pieces of fried bone, tail. And it was delicious. It tasted like fried chicken skins.   Yasu is a small, little Japanese restaurant, where you are often seated in close quarters, so it's nice when you have neighbors who share your spirit of adventure. Luckily we did. Our neighbors opted for fish cheeks and a different preparation of Aji. They said they were amazing.   As for the service. Last time we ate there it was very slow, but it was fun to sit there for a couple hours and really enjoy the food and ambiance. This visit, our server was new and there were a few hiccups, but all were properly resolved and did not have any bearing on our overall experience.   The owner was at Yasu and made a point of stopping by our table and talked to us for a while about food, the Olympics, life.   Although we didn't order the foie gras and eggplant this time, we had it last and it was so good. Seriously just melts in your mouth. The sushi also was amazing.",

Combo included crab special roll, which was not quite a Cali roll but still tasty, miso soup, average, and a side salad with an awesome dressing.  Friend had sashimi assortment and said it was fresh.  Side edamame were overpriced, not warm and seasoned with only table salt so unfinished.  Decor is very attractive inside, with a small patio.  Our server seemed shy but competent.  But $7 for a kirin draft beer at lunch, when the menu said $5? Not cool.  I would go back for the teriyaki chicken though.",

    "text": "The hubs and I have driven by this place a million times since we moved here to Phoenix over a year ago but never managed to fit it into our dining out schedule. When my sis and bro in law came to visit for New Year's weekend and they were craving sushi we decided to hit this spot up.   We arrived around 8pm on Friday night and the place was still poppin' with people...we took that as a good sign. It's a small and cozy place but we were seated right away. The staff and chefs were friendly and welcoming so we were excited to sit down for dinner especially when our server told us all about their tapas specials. Awesome! Be warned, they do have a lot of menus so it gets a bit overwhelming but it's easy to just ask the server to explain things - she was super nice!  We tried several of the tapas including the shitake mushrooms and green beans. Umm...amazing stuff. We then ordered 5-6 rolls for all of us and enjoyed our favorites like unagi, spicy tuna, salmon skin and shrimp tempura. Let me just say that even there was not one grain of rice left on our plates. We demolished everything we ordered!   The best part was that this place has such a cozy feel and a nice ambience that we had a great time talking and hanging out even after we devoured all our food. We didn't even realize that the place had closed while we were sitting there! 20 minutes after closing time we realized what time it was and promptly got up...but the staff never rushed us or made us feel like we had to interrupt the nice night out we were having.   We arrived excited for dinner and left happy knowing we have a new sushi spot just around the corner. Woo-hoo!",

    "text": "What can I say? This place rocks!  Yasu knows his fish and truly took my dinner party on a flavor adventure.  The restaurant seats under 50, so the atmosphere is very cozy and warm. We took our seats and prepared our palettes for the freshest and most savory fish I have tasted in Arizona.   I don't know where to begin... I'll highlight my favorites  Bacon wrapped scallops, cooked to perfection. The bacon was crispy and they achieved this without overcooking the scallops.   Red snapper carpaccio pounded paper thin - yum, melted in my mouth  Red miso eggplant (This eggplant has a much thinner skin, a more delicate flavor, and very little seeds that tend to make other American eggplants bitter) this dish was amazing, so full of flavor (It was even a hit with my little sis who normally hates eggplant).  Garlic miso clams - Our server suggested picking them up like cups and slurping the clams out so you get the full experience and do not miss any of the miso. Excellent idea.  Wagyu sashimi (Kobe beef comes from a breed of cattle called Wagyu, learned this that evening). It was served with a sliver of fried garlic and a wonderful dipping sauce, but I didn't use it because the quality of the meat was so that I did not want to cover up the flavor.  Kampachi (This yellowtail must be extremely high in fat, it tasted like butter. (I didn't want to share).  We ended the meal with Foie gras sushi and a chilled tiny Peach.  I had to give my taste buds a moment to recover from the Foie gras, just let that flavor marinate my taste buds... Wow!  This meal was excellent and our server was well educated. He recommended options we would not have been so bold to try without his prompting.  Hats off to Yasu and team, this place is culinary expertise at it's best.",

    "text": "I am super healthy because I am full of experiences. And most of those experiences took place at great restaurants, especially at Yasu Sushi Bistro. I always feel like I hit the jackpot when I discover a neighborhood gem especially when the owner/chef is so likable. Been driving past this spot and finally made it in during a week night. Infatuation approved. The staff are so lovely and friendly to chat up and Yasu, the owner/chef is an uhmazing human. He's been around the valley for over 15 years and knows all the great Asian spots that are off the radar.   This is simply a fantastic Japanese restaurant! It is my spot. Located in a rundown strip mall, this place will surprise you beyond belief. Inside is a modern sophistication with a zen atmosphere. Holding off the hungry crowd, doors don't open until 5pm and specials last til 7p on the appetizers. You know what I will say, pull a seat at the bar and chat up.   My faves are the bacon wrapped dates because who ever goes wrong with that as an appetizer? The smoky flavor by far surpasses all other versions I've had. I am a big fan of the sake Yasu serves on happy hour which are presented in champagne flutes, not shot glasses. As any sake enthusiast knows, it should be sipped and served slightly chilled to bring out the best aromas, much like wine. My ultimate favorite is the softshell crab. Deep fried goodness with a crispy outside and tender crab meat inside. Served tastefully and artfully, I don't like sharing these at all. The bay scallop tempura skewers were refreshing and surprisingly a nice palate cleanser. I ended up getting the special at the time, Hawaiian yellow tail belly sashimi. There are no words to describe it other than happiness eruptions in my mouth.   Did you really think my review would not highlight dessert? Everything is made in house fresh that morning. I would partake in every selection but I had gym calling afterwards. I ended up with the chocolate cake with ice cream and raspberry sauce. Light, airy, dense, rich, I don't even know how to describe it since I was delirious with happiness.  Eventually, I got too full which is a good thing for the kitchen staff. I will be back for bamboo wrapped beef tongue, saikyo duck breast, and a side Japanese whiskey and the Magic Toast dessert. Whatever better reason than those to return? Besides, I need to update this review and eat more. If you try it before me, I will stalk your pictures and reviews.",

Apparently it gets pretty busy and we tried walking in for dinner and were asked to wait. We opted for an outside table so the wait would be shorter -- the patio was completely empty. They set our table, but still made us wait another 25 minutes or so without explanation before seating us at it. I totally understand that an empty table doesn't automatically mean the kitchen is able to handle more people, but some expectation setting would have been nice, or at least the option to sit and have some drinks while we waited.   The food was actually pretty good with some unique options, but no better than other sushi places in town (e.g., Nori or Harumi) and, in my opinion, not worth the high price tag. We did have an awesome server, though I likely won't be returning.",

    "text": "Bryan and I were the first to arrive at the door of this little sushi bistro, unassuming in the middle of a strip mall not far from Target and REI. They did not open the door a minute before 5:30pm when they officially opened but a few regulars soon lined up behind us. We sat on an old wooden bench aged with character until we were allowed in.  The interior starkly contrasted the outside appearance with modern sophistication, zen atmosphere and sleek lines. I'd say the seating was cozy because the place is not that big but \"just right\" for an intimate setting.   The Paradise Uni appetizer was served in a glass. Fresh uni, quail egg, caviar, oyster among other ingredients boasted a flavor that combined sweet, salty, and savory. It's hard to explain. You'd have to order it for yourself to experience it.  The Mackerel was first served sliced and raw and eaten sashimi style with lemon citrus. Then after we finished it, they brought back the remains deep fried and crispy so we could eat it like soft shelled crab. Usually, when we eat mackerel as sushi, it tends to have a \"fishier\" flavor to it, but here, this was NOT the case. It was light, flavorful in a great way, and delicately perfect.   Scallops with green onion and crispy onion and garlic flakes - very refreshing and the onions weren't too potent surprisingly. They complimented the scallops well!  Garlic miso clams were amazing. The seaweed was Panko dipped and fried and the crispiness tasted wonderful with the clams and miso broth. They later took the remaining broth and cooked a risotto with the the broth which was phenomenal.   The fatty pork belly with the poached egg was definitely dense and super savory. I didn't expect it to be served in a broth but it definitely did not disappoint. We enjoyed this in contrast to all the seafood we were eating.  We polished off dinner with the Magic Toast dessert suggested by Joey, our fabulous attentive waiter. There was mozzarella cheese that topped banana bread, served with homemade vanilla ice cream and a Yamamoto Berry Japanese peach. A red wine sauce topped this heavenly unique concoction. We were blown away.   As for drinks, I had a Japanese whiskey that was soaked in coffee beans. If you are a whiskey fan and like a slight in a coffee flavor in your whiskey, get it!   I love this Yasu Sushi Bistro. It lived up to its name. I've already been telling family and friends to come here. It doesn't need my vouch for support though. It already has a loyal following of its own.",

The sauces are well paired. The hot dishes are also very good.  When given the option I like to go with the carpaccio or the sashimi.  The date wrapped in bacon is sweet and savory full of smoke and is a must.  The tapas style specials are fun and makes it easy for sampling.  I like the shrimp dish.  Foie gras dish is always fantastic. We order it w eggplant and eat it at the end as our dessert.  The place gets packed on the weekends and the kitchen can get behind.

It took them 45 minutes to remake the dish that was basically a few slices of raw fish. Then each plate took longer and longer to come out. Our last $5 tapas dish took 27 minutes to come after our previous dish. Lastly as we received our last dinner item, the restaurant was flooded with a light smoke and our eyes burned. I suspect it was onions, but we rushed desert and the check so we could get out of there. I would love to go back for the food, but I will probably wait until I forget how bad the service was to come back.",

    "text": "This place is legit! Specialty Fish flown in Tokyo fish market, fish procure in US is the top 2%. Preparation and presentation is top notch. House made Tofu with Kyoto soy milk. Even the rice is in the sushi USA amazing. It's real sushi rice and preparation not the sticky mushy crap that is serve at most restaurant.  Our waitress Lizette was AMAZING! Restaurants take note if you want to serve high quality ingredients and have customer enjoy it, your wait staff need to know and should be passionate and knowledgeable about it. She was patient, funny and explained everything to me without rushing me even though the restaurant was a little busy.  Worth EVERY. SINGLE. penny. Skip the Americanize rolls and stick with Nigiri, sashimi and cooked dishes.",

    "text": "In a world filled with fast food and grubhub, it becomes difficult to find restaurants where the tenants of passion, quality and flavor are still held above all else. Yasu, the chef-owner of his aptly named bistro, is a guide into an alternate reality where the caliber of the ingredient and its skilled preparation still reigns above all else. His food is art, you will understand this after you take your first bite. His passion and knowledge in a space often bogged down by sushi rolls named after US states and cities (looking at you, California and Las Vegas) is a breath of fresh air.   If you can only read one sentence of this entire review, let it be this; you will not find more authentic and high quality Japanese cuisine anywhere else in all of Arizona.   As a classically trained Japanese sushi chef, his technique and finesse are unrivaled. The aesthetically pleasing plating is used to usher the diner to what comes next - one incredible bite after another. What makes Yasu's culinary creations so exceptional is his incredible palate combined with his superbly procured ingredients. Yasu has mastered the art of minimalist cuisine in all the right ways, he diligently respects the ingredients and lets their strengths shine brightly. His fish distributor? None other than the most famous fish market in not only Tokyo, but the world - Tsukiji. He takes more pride in his work than any chef I have ever met, and every dish he serves is a testament to that. His devotion to quality is what initially drew me in to dine with Yasu, but it was his consistency in preparation that has made me a regular.  Honestly, for the level of quality you are receiving, the prices are extremely fair. If you come here expecting an all-you-can-eat buffet, you are missing the point of the experience. There is a $5 tapas menu filled with awesome appetizers for a great price, served all night (beer, hot and cold sake too, until 7:00).   The must-haves from the tapas menu are:  -Snake Shiitake (flash fried mushrooms in a deliciously savory and nuanced sauce)  -Beef Short-Ribs (marinated cooked on his authentic Japanese charcoal grill) -The Sushi Roll of the Day (rotates between spicy salmon, spicy yellow-tail, and salmon skin)  -Yasu style seared tuna  All of the sashimi is exceptional, but the unique dishes I would highlight for anyone with a discerning palate to try:  -Kanpachi Sashimi (baby yellow-tail) -Ocean Trout Carpaccio -Red Snapper Carpaccio -Yasu Style Salmon -Tuna Sashimi with Fresh Garlic  The kitchen creates masterful productions as well and there are plenty of unique dishes you won't find anywhere else:  -Teriyaki Salmon Kama (the cheek and side of the fish cooked on the Japanese charcoal grill and served with a delicious house-made teriyaki sauce) -Saikyo Miso Black Cod (The best cod on the market marinated for 3 days in a miso-sake mixture and grilled) -Shrimp Stuffed Japanese Eggplant  Not to be overshadowed by the food, the staff (I have a hard time calling them that) are each exceptional in their own right. Each member of the team is highly educated on the menu and its nuances, they help make an incredible experience even better. When I come in, they know my name. That level of personalization is a rarity in today's world and is something I highly appreciate and do not take for granted. Joey, Lizette, and Louanie do an exceptional job guiding the experience and they definitely deserve recognition for the job they do!   Yasu Sushi Bistro exemplifies everything that makes a truly exceptional restaurant. Service, quality, ambiance, and creativity - all of these are found here, unparalleled. Loyalty is something that is earned, not given, and Yasu certainly has earned mine. A genuinely great person and an impressive chef, I feel lucky that I have the opportunity to experience his cuisine as often as I do. I have never left disappointed and I have a feeling that I won't anytime soon. Thank you, Yasu!",

Chef Yasu's artistic touch makes each dish magical on both eyes & tongue.  Tips:  Try anything on specials board.              The Uni is best in Valley and sashimi is very        generous .             The Seafood Paradise is just that               Carpaccio's are all amazing              The Steamed Pork Buns are beyond ridiculous               Lunch:  Bento box               Poke Seaweed salad   Don't miss the grilled options like pork belly or whole  squid .  The $5 Tapas Menu contains some great grilled items as well.  Even the udon is spectacular!",

With that said, we had a bit of a problem with their vent system, when we walked in there was a very pungent \"smoke\" and/or grease odor, didn't think much of it until we were sitting for a bit and our eyes started to water. I noticed a fan upon entering the restaurant but figured it was due to the 109 degrees outside and they wanted to make sure restaurant was comfortable! Maybe not so much. The smoke actually got worse as we were eating! Noticed a few others rubbing their eyes as well...The other problem was when we left, our clothes & hair smelled of the same odor/smoke in the restaurant. Just horrible. Looks like I won't be going back until the winter months when we can sit on the outside patio. So unfortunate because the food and staff were incredible.",

I also really liked the calamari. The texture of the squid along with the panko was really yummy! The sauce that came with the calamari was a very citric and went surprisingly well with the calamari.   The restaurant itself was pretty small. There isn't much room for the wait staff to move around which causes them to bump into the tables. When we walked into the place the waitress was very awkward; she kind of made us feel like we weren't supposed to be there, and made a funny face when we asked for a table lol our waitress was very nice but didn't really check up on us. I would've just expected better service from such an expensive restaurant, but the overall quality was amazing. :)",

The food was decent but not really at that price point they charged. The nigiri that was served was really thin.... also the risotto could have either used a bit more rice or cooked longer. A soupy risotto shows the lack of attention. We did enjoy the first course of the crab and uni combo on top of a tempura seaweed the best!  One thing that really caught me off guard was when the waitress mentioned that to get a refill on the green tea, there's an additional charge. Whatttt.... ok?  Never have I ever been charged for green tea refill...anywhere...even in Japan!....so that made me feel like I was really being nickeled and dimed especially paying for a Japanese meal experience that is on the expensive side. Granted when the bill came, they did not charge us for the tea. Nevertheless, being told that they are going to... really puts me in a bad mood.  If the food didn't stand out in my mind and the service did(not in an amazing way), I would suggest that this shouldn't be a place you go for omakase.",

I recommend the agedashi tofu and kurobuta sausage skewers!  Food comes in somewhat small portions so I wouldn't recommend coming here with more than 4 people if you plan on stuffing yourself.  I visited here last weekend for my birthday and got the saikyo beef tongue, garlic manila clams, kurobuta sausage, grilled bronzino (Mediterranean sea bass), grilled squid, and a few other things I honestly can't quite remember. Food came out really quick--maybe in under 10 minutes? They also spaced out the time between platters of food to ensure that we'd all enjoy each plate one by one.   I appreciate their take on Japanese cuisine, as most places only offer bentos and maki rolls, which gets boring after a while.",

    "text": "Wow. I've been going to Yasu Sushi since 2007. It used to be a fine establishment with great sushi. The past two times, however, I have been horribly sick afterwards.   The sushi rolls are very loose and sloppy, even though they take a long time to come out.   Tonight there were 3 servers and 2 runners, and yet it took 3 hours to complete our order.   I had set up a birthday reservation for 6:30 for 6, and we were the only reservation for the night--I looked at the paper. They had sat two other people on our table. So much for reservations.   Our server never refilled our drinks, nor did he get addition drinks without us tracking him down.   A friend went to the manager that was \"too busy\" to listen. Over $200 in food and drinks and you're too busy?!  Yasu was a great place. Now they are simply just another sushi restaurant in a strip mall. What a disappointment.",

Yasu has great quality fish (specially for AZ being inland it is always hard to find fresh fish). We let Yasu pick out our food! We had the albacore (they only get it twice a year it was superb!), jalepeno sushi roll, dates wrapped in bacon, and the Yasu beans (two orders; it was that good!). Btw, do not use soy sauce! Everything is perfect and does not need it!  Everything was excellent and my favorite part was the aesthetically pleasing display of the food. Everything was in harmony, which is rare in most affordable restaurants. We will return to Yasu!",

Art is not just taught to anyone.  here sushi is artwork, creative colorful and then taste so great. that is the experience that comes from Japan.

This is our second time here and I can't wait to go back. My new favorite restaurant in Pheonix area but I'm partial to Sushi. We went this time on a Monday night. It was quiet and very pleasant. The staff was super attentive and non rushed. Everything at our request. And the meal was over the top, again! Cheese Cream Baked Scallops, Fried Green Beans, Las Vegas Roll (not on menu but eagerly made), Tuna Garlic Sashimi (new on menu) and to top it off...the Yasu Roll...off the hook! Next time we go, we're doing the Chef's choice program where Chef Yasu cooks up whatever his imagination comes up with. We watched a couple moan with pleasure as they slapped the table top every time he came out with something else. Incredible!",

I am a huge fan of tamago and order it everywhere I go for sushi, but I think other places must use frozen premade patties, but not Yasu. I don't remember what the fish was but we got sashimi with some sauce and a jalapeno on it, and holy crap was that delicious. And the lamb chops we had were unreal also. Just go order everything!!

The roll menu is quite limited, but all are good including the salmon skin, which was my first experience. We ordered a scallop dish, which, I had initially tried to explain to our server a baked scallop concoction I'd had a couple of years ago there that was delicious, and she said maybe it was a special that day (I'd had it on 2 different occasions) but it sounded like the scallops and uni so I decided to try it. Should have asked what Uni is (turns out it's urchin). Tastes like the way low tide in Key West smells. Otherwise a very good experience and I feel like Andrew Zimmern or Anthony Bourdain now... As another post I read said \"Expensive as Hell\" which I nearly agree with.",

But when I went to Yasu, we had the greatest server that talked me into getting the eel (yikes!) roll.  And guess what? I liked it! I wish I could remember his name, but I can't, so I'll just say that he had brown hair and was really funny.  Hope that helps.    Anyways, we also had the calamari, which was delicious and the tempura, and it was really good as well. My friend tried a few different sushi rolls, including the spicy tuna, which I tried too- it was delicious.    You'd never really guess that this place is so great... it's in a strip mall and just doesn't give off that 'eat here- I have fabulous sushi' vibe.  But if you bypass it for somewhere else, you'll definitely be missing out!!",

    "text": "Yasu. It's been on my list for a while now and I finally got a chance to go. We selected a Saturday night without reservations and hoped for the best. We arrived and immediately were seated on the benches at the sushi bar at our request. The decor was very pretty and clean, I liked the folded and tied napkin, and the smooth black river rock. It had no purpose but to be pleasant and calming. We quickly forgot we were in a strip mall in AZ. The server greeted us immediately and we just as quickly disappointed him when we chose not to select any fine alcohols, but he was polite and began a description of the foods available this evening. I knew I was going to have a hard time picking from the decadent options, but since I needed to coordinate tastes with my husband, we began gently selecting, eliminating, and balancing all the options.  Here is what we ended up choosing:  Kampachi (baby yellowtail) Sushi  Blue Fin Toro Sushi  These two selections were divine and buttery.  I looked sadly at our empty plate when they were both gone. One taste of each, but it was our first visit, I didn't know better. My regret is not selecting the Sashimi option. Next time I am getting Sashimi for sure.  Miso Soup with Clam. We needed to try the home made Miso. Wherever you go it's one good indicator of quality and while it was good, we should have chosen one bowl to share instead of a bowl each. We enjoyed it, but in the future we won't waste a selection spot on the Miso, much less two spots. That was silly of us.  Grilled Diver Scallops with Uni Cream Sauce. We looked for the bacon wrapped scallops, but they weren't an option. I loved the meaty well prepared scallops and enjoyed pouring the Uni cream all over. The presentation was pretty, but it was only a nibble of asparagus. As asparagus is relatively cheap, they could offer a bit more than one stalk quartered into a tiny Lincoln log pile. Maybe three stalks fanned with grill flavor? Still the presentation reminded me to eat slow and savor my bites. Easily the tastiest dish.  Sauteed Mirugai with Assorted Mushrooms.  I enjoyed the shredded red threads that garnished the pile of earthy blended clam and mushrooms, but my husband did not like that texture. There wasn't anything wrong flavor wise with the dish, it was pleasant for me, but not a wow.  In this spot we might have been more pleased with an item from the grill or something with tempura.  As our server got pulled away to the benched people next to us, we took his advice when it was time to order more things and spoke directly to Taki and Yasu, who happened to be right in from of us. We did come here for sushi, so we ordered: Spicy Tuna, Phoenix Roll and Yasu roll. How can you not order a roll named after the owner? While we waited for these next things, the benches were starting to be quite uncomfortable. No backs and a ridged lip were starting to make us shift about. We couldn't see what the Sushi chef was doing through the panel in front of us anyway, so while it was nice to be so close to the chef's we decided that next time we will sit in the dining room. Out came the rolls. I really think they are the same roll with very minor differences. Roe in one and cucumber wrapped around the other. I thought they were very tasty though. I only used a small bit of wasabi and soy, but that wasn't truly necessary, just habit. The spicy tuna didn't impress me as much, and it was here that I decided Yasu was truly more a Bistro than a sushi bar. Not in a bad way, just a note to myself that it's best for all the plated selections more so than the sushi. No reason for it NOT to be a fabulous sushi bar, as everything was so fresh, but something was missing for me and I couldn't put my finger on it. Some of the best fish I've had, yet not the best sushi?  Then we ordered the Salmon Sashimi. That was fabulous! Sliced thick enough, clean, amazingly smooth it reminded me I screwed up getting Blue Fin Toro as a sushi instead of Sashimi. I ate slowly, not wishing everything to be over yet, but my husband was full. I had come starving. I shouldn't do that! I batted my eyes a bit and said softly... Dessert?  We had the Green Tea Cheesecake with Chocolate fondue. They piped the cheesecake spirally onto three skewers and laid them each onto one topping: small bit of coconut, candied pineapple and pecans. The chocolate fondue was milk chocolate and was best used as a drizzle instead of a dip. I was very indelicate with the dessert, finding the skewer quite awkward. I just used my thumb and forefinger to slide the Cheesecake off and popped it into my mouth. I shrugged. Not classy of me, but it worked. I would use a harder cheesecake format and cube it for dipping, instead of that presentation, but it was different!  Our cost with 18% tip was $125. All in all I was very glad we went to Yasu and we will go again to try many more things. Very pleasant waitstaff, nice evening. Recommended.",

    "text": "Best Japanese in AZ, hands down.  I try ALL the sushi places and this place is the best.  The original dishes are top notch and the grilled food is amazing.  Also a good bar, try the shisotini. First, get something off the specials menu.  I've been 7 times now and I ALWAYS order off the specials menu.  They often have VERY good toro, even otoro on occasion, always a first recommendation at any sushi place.  Also they use special wood for the grilled items so you also have to try one of the those.  If you have friends/family that fear sushi the carpacios (usually similar to sizzled fish, sashimi and hot oil) are always tasty and very non-daring.  Also the cooked specials are plentiful so do not fear.  If they have the live ama ebi this is a MUST.  You will not see it live, but you'll taste it and YES, eat the heads!  Lately seared scallops w/ uni sauce has had a semi permanent spot on the specials and that is amazing. The service is great and the price is fair, usually $100-$125 for two with drinks and desert (the desert rules).  Great for a date, birthday, etc.  It's in a very unassuming spot in a strip mall near a target and circle K.  Anyone who knows sushi knows to frequent small unassuming spots in strip malls.  The interior is great and the atmosphere is comfortable and classy all at once.  One of the best restaurants in AZ, and I've eaten (frequently) at most.",

The atmosphere was cozy (it is a small restaurant), but the staff is very helpful, from the hostess who seats you, to the bartender, to the wait staff and the manager.

The hostess walks by several times as we try to politely make eye contact with her. Finally she comes over and offers us water, which is great, but we really wanted a few beers... but water is ok, I guess? Then she tells us it will be \"a little bit longer\" for a table. I asked how long she estimated-- she said \"a little bit\" again, then \"another 10-15 minutes.\" Or we could sit at the sushi bar. Fine, we'll sit at the bar. We sit down only to realize the sushi bar is, duh, in front of the sushi bar, but the window is blocked with fabric so you can't actually see anything. What's the point of a sushi bar seating then? Once we ordered service improved, but it was still a fairly long wait to get our rolls. One sushi chef was literally yelling at the waitress to bring a spoon to a specific table... Professional! It seemed like the place had a lot of potential but they needed a floor manager to be paying attention. The rolls were good, the salmon sashimi was awesome, and prices weren't outrageous. Hopefully the service improves and the place will be a gem.",

    "text": "Best Japanese restaurant in the valley! And I mean Japanese food... not just sushi... not that their sushi is bad, quite the opposite, BUT I just think that Yasu shines more in their other fare.  Although not of late, I'm an avid customer... at one point, my sushi buddy and I were quite chummy with a busser, Leo the bartender and Assa, a waiter there. Love how the staff yells out Welcomes (Irashaimase!) and Thank Yous (Arigatou!) as you enter and exit... just as if you were dining in Japan!  As it is a small place, it can get full and a wait may be involved, but trust me, it's worth it. I however, usually arrive for a late dinner--past 8, so most of the time I don't have any problems getting seated. I think it's best to come here with lots of time on your hands, good company that will keep your eye off your watch and how long things may take to prepare... it'll help your experience greatly. And, during peak dining hours, make reservations!  Now for the food. My favorite dishes are the Shrimp Noodle Skewers (Who knew you could wrap shrimp with noodles--and the chanterelle cilantro dipping sauce... soooo goood!), Fried Calamari (So prettily presented--I love the Cod Roe and thin strips of seaweed that tops the small tower of squid goodness), Agedashi Tofu (Love the mini shimeji's), and the Sumibiyaki! Bacon wrapped Asparagus is my fave! Oh yes, Bistro wings are also tasty (But makes me yearn for a side of white rice)!  For sushi, my sushi buddy and I are quite frugal and simple, sticking to they lighter rolls: Eel & Cucumber, Spicy Tuna (Best ever--and this coming from a hardly ever raw sushi eater), and the Kanpyo Roll (Gourd Strip Roll), out of the specialty rolls, I think my favorite is the Red Roll... I love the IDEA of the Yasu Roll, but hate the fact that the sushi falls out from the slippery cucumber wrapping... there's got to be a better way to execute the outer wrapping... maybe go thinner? Also of note is the size of the rolls are smaller... which, IMHO is better, your supposed to be able to pop an entire sushi in your mouth. I think they are rightly proportioned with that rule in mind.  Dessert is one of two choices IMHO: Chocolate Souffle with Yamamomo on the side (If you're sharing, ask for 2 Yamamomo's!--They may charge you, but I think it's worth it not to share the tart little fruit) OR the Tempura Ichigo (Strawberry) Mochi Ice Cream--DIVINE!  P.S. At first I was against this place... saddened that a more expensive restaurant had replaced my inexpensive sushi choice (R.I.P. Cafe Kobe) that also sold Boba drinks and crepes--even wrapped it burrito style and sliced it up depending on how many you were sharing with... but after eating at Yasu, my frown turned upside down into a BIG GRIN. Yes, Yasu's menu is a few more bucks to shell out, but oh so worth it!",

    "text": "I seriously doubted I would be able to find five star sushi in Phoenix.  I was wrong, wrong, wrong.  Yasu...what a pleasant surprise.  The place could be lost in a strip near a Target and REI, but once you walk in you are transported.  The decor is minimalist and soothing.  It's small enough to feel intimate but not crowded.  The sushi bar is small, with just four seats (two to a bench).  It was a little odd to not be able to see through to the sushi chef's prep area, but in this case it didn't matter.  After the first bite we offered ourselves up to Yasu's expertise, deciding we trusted him completely.  From the kitchen we had sake steamed Manila clams.  They were fresh and smooth.  The broth was light and buttery.  We also had the grilled scallop in bacon.  The scallop itself was huge, and braised to perfection.  But let's continue to the sushi!  Our tastes are rather simple when it comes to sushi...no crazy rolls involving tempura, spicy anything or cream cheese.  Along with our standard tekka (tuna) and Kappa (cucumber) rolls, we did order a soft shell crab roll.  Well-done.  The rest of our items were either nigiri or sashimi: octopus, chu-toro, mackerel and salmon (be sure to get Yasu-style: just a touch of flame with ponzu, no need to dip).  Specials included striped jack, fluke, and Kumamoto oysters.  All of the fish was high quality, fresh and expertly prepared.  The rice had a perfect consistency.  I think my favorite of the night was the fluke.  It was served with ponzu instead of soy sauce, allowing the light, subtle flavor to shine.  The chef, Yasu, and his assistant, Takeshi were helpful and very friendly.  They made sure to encourage us to ask if we had questions, and to make some suggestions.  Be sure to ask for fresh grated wasabi instead of the regular stuff.  Oh, and save room for dessert.  The green tea tiramisu was unreasonably, ridiculously delightful.  I am thoroughly impressed with Yasu, and look forward to returning next time I'm in Phoenix.",

The sashimi and sushi were up to the mark, somebody sitting next to me at the sushi bar got served up with deep fried  baby octopus - an off menu item  - I would have gone for that , but I was done by the time it appeared  ! The ambience was great  - a little loungey, it seemd to me that the staff were outnumbering the  clients most of the time, but it  had a friendly open vibe , everyone was gossiping and laughing in Japanese and English and everyone including me seemed to be  having a  very good time.   Definitely worth a visit, it's more in Scottsdale - of I-51 - than Phoenix for those familiar with this area.",

I heard about YASU in PHX MAG and then Yelped it....  Have gone there twice in the last week. First time did more of a sampling menu, sushi, things from the grill etc. The second time just rolls.  Both times I was impressed. The rolls aren't large (which I actually like) and the fish is really fresh and delicious. No need for soy sauce or wasabi. The grilled duck was recommended by our server (I am no a huge duck guy) and it was pretty kick ass.  We also had a crab which was good, but the portion of crab meat for the price was a little small.   I would just skip dessert. Nothing too impressive. But the sushi is great and the menu is very unique. Cool atmosphere (dark, good music, but still casual).  I don't think I will be going back to west side sushi!",

(I lived in Boston for 3 years and they get stuff I crave, like Kumomato Oysters, all types of fish and meat from East Coast farms)   3. Pricing is right on...since they are serving stuff that is difficult to procure, I am always amazed at the value they present.   Keep Rocking Yasu!!!",

But they have two chicken katsus on their lunch menu...we ordered the 10 dollar one. the chicken curry katsu. they brought us the 16 dollar one. the jidori chicken katsu. we did not say \"jidori\" at all when we ordered. let's be clear about that. the food was already late (35 mins after we ordered) when we got it so we didn't think too much of it and scarfed it down.  when they brought the bill, we protested the 6 dollar difference in charge...but they blamed US and said that since we ate the meal, we had to pay for it.   the time from which they brought us the check to the time we walked out the door took 50 minutes. we protested at how long it was taking but the manager blamed US for asking him to split up the check.  As a customer, I had never been blamed for a restaurant's bad service. If you want to be blamed TWICE in one meal for a restaurant staff's incompetence, then Yasu Sushi is the place for you!",

The shrimp fondue was fatty. Needless to say, the place did not live up to its expectations. The kitchen service was wretched, though the waiters were very nice and tried to compensate for the slow kitchen. The main dishes were served 10 minutes apart for each person so by the time one person finished his entree they serve the next persons entree. You feel very uncomfortable eating while the other person is still waiting for their food. We will probably not be coming back.",

This may speak to how average most are, but only two in the region have ever stuck out.  The first is Sushi Ken, located along Chandler Blvd in Ahwatukee.  I'll save that for another review but, if you have the opportunity, be sure to check it out.  The other is Yasu.  My wife and I had an impromptu dinner here a few weeks back and very much enjoyed it.  We actually had one order of California roll as an appetizer and the first quality I noticed was how fresh it tasted, much unlike the kind that comes in a plastic carton from Basha's.  Upgrade.  The accompanying miso soup had a striking taste without being overwhelming.  For our entree, we shared the rib eye steak.  The steak itself was nice and tender but the highlight were the included dipping sauces.  Delicious!  The restaurant itself is a little cramped for my liking, but it has a very cool, laid-back vibe.  The sushi chefs were busy chatting up a couple at the bar, talking about their favorite items on the menu and just making it feel even more pleasant.  Yasu makes me happy I moved to NE Phoenix.",

I was totally blown away by the quality of the hamachi.  Absolutely the freshest yellowtail I've had in Phoenix.  Since then, we've eat there several more times for lunch and three times at dinner and every time it's been incredibly good.  Just the simple tuna roll is the best I've had in Phoenix also.  Super fantastic food.  As for price - any good sushi restaurant is going to be expensive, but we've spent as much or more at lesser quality restaurants like Sakana.  Also, $1.50 for soda nowadays is fantastic.  And, having Echigo beer is a definite plus.  Yasu has a great atmosphere, though I wish they had a longer sushi bar where you could watch the chefs do their thing.  We regularly bring our 11-year-old son who loves sushi and that's no problem.  The noise level is acceptable, though expect long waits if you show up on a weekend night without reservations.  If you like Sushi at all, please make your way to Yasu - it's well worth almost any drive.  I can't wait to go back!",

There are mostly simple, classic sushi offerings as well as some spectacular add ons like soba and tempura.  Their tempura is some of the best I have tasted.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because for those that want more trendy sushi (ala \"RA\") or more americanized offerings this will be disappointing.  I would recommend going somewhere else if more traditional fare is not preferred, leave the tables for us that love the classics.",

Every time I've been here the service has been pretty awesome... Except this one time my waitress didn't refill my water for the longest time. I thought I was going to die from dehydration. :( But other than the ONE TIME they've been darlings.   The one thing that I HATE *GASP!* is the enormous plates they use for the entrees I order. I mean. I got the kumamoto oysters and they're wee cute little oysters. Four of them, barely the size of my thumb all nestled on this plate of ice the size of TITANIC. Okay, not that big, but it took up 1/3 of my table! I was like. Are you serious? I don't even have room to eat. :(  I still love this place though, complaints are minor, just a pain when I bring my boyfriend who doesn't eat anything I like to eat. It makes me feel ronery at the table.  I hope they expand their restaurant size in the future, possibly install table grills to make Okonomiyaki?  *Hopes&prays&wishes*",

I think this is what places like Ippei and Taneko in Scottsdale have been trying to do, but just can't seem to get right. A modern Japanese restaurant that offers select sushi and a variety of sharable plates in a cool, comfortable atmosphere. Where the other restaurants fail, Yasu nails it.  Everything at Yasu was executed almost to perfection - food, service, decor, ambiance. Fantastic menu and even better list of specials, which had just as many items! Definitely try the tsukune, a skewered chicken \"meatball\" cooked over charcoal - just fantastic. And the sushi was uber fresh and delicious. They'll even customize to your taste if you ask. There's also a full bar and a very nice selection of wine and sake, of which the staff is very knowledgable.   Only a couple negatives to mention. The sushi bar is small, 4 people max, and you can't see the fish or chef's working their magic. Also, the seats at the sushi bar are 2 curved wooden benches - a bit hard and uncomfortable.  Other than that, I just wish we'd tried Yasu sooner, can't wait to go back for more...",

As mentioned by others the service was a bit slow, and for those of used to old-school sushi places where they just place fish on a plate, the presentation was fussy.  It was also very difficult to take the lid off of the trash can in the men's room (and to be clear the ease or difficulty of doing so is not one of my usual criteria for judging a restaurant, but it was so difficult I thought it worth mentioning)  Ovverall I would definitely recommend this place and I would definitely come here again",

    "text": "We live very close to Yasu and been here for about 3 times. The first time was with my husband, it was decent. The second time was with my sister before her flight to NY, the service was slow food was decent, worst than the first time. We went there for the third time after my kids swimming lesson. (Yes, we weren't dressed like we were a rich family after swimming practice!)   We walked in at 11:45am and almost immediately we ordered right away. We also ordered 2 extra rolls 5 minutes later. The rainbow roll was HORRIBLE. Rice was hard and very cold, tasted it like overnight refrigerated rice. I made a complained to the waiter but he soon return telling me they don't know why it was hard and walked away. Okay, fine i will swallow the $13 roll that tasted worst than Frys' sushi.   We finished the food soon after and we were sitting there waiting for 2 more rolls to come. We waited... Waited and waited.... No one came by to if we needed anything, no water refills, or take away our empty plates. It was like we were invisible.   Finally I asked the waiter about my 2 rolls and told him I wanted to cancel. He then returned 5-7 minutes later with one of the sushi roll. We ate that and waited AGAIN... Waited and waited for my final roll to come. Finally I told the waiter I wanted the check. He came back 10 minutes later with my check and I was charged with 4 rolls. I told him I only got 3 rolls but he said no I got all of the rolls. He went to the sushi chiefs about it and they too said us had all the rolls.   SERIOUSLY? Yasu? You think I'm gonna lie about eating those nasty rolls of yours? We did not leave until 1:30pm. I spent most of the time waiting for 4 rolls. 11:45- 1:30pm is a longtime trying to have a quick lunch. The worst thing about this whole experience was that all of the staff made me feel like I ate the roll and don't want to pay for it. They were arguing behind the sushi bar about weather or not I ate the roll.   It's disgusting how you run your business!!! Shame on you Yasu. Worst service and sushi I ever had in my life. My husband and I love sushi and we spend a lot of money eating sushi monthly. And btw, we are not poor, my husband is an ER physician, we have money to pay for whatever we ordered. But I am not gonna pay for something we waited so furiously long for and still did not get to eat sushi.   I am seriously disappointed at your extreme slow service, manners of your staff, and the not so fresh sushi. There are way too many options for sushi in Phoenix, and I will never waste a penny in this restaurant. Not this life time and the next! If I can give you a -10, -10 is what you should deserve in my rating!",

I say to the server \"We've never been here and we are out celebrating our 16th year anniversary.\" She sells us a couple apps. First app arrives a little after 8pm. We watch two guys that sat at the bar 30 min after our arrival receive their food. Another app arrives a few min after 8. Husband makes sure she has our full order- she doesn't and says it wont be long if she orders the sweet shrimp now. 8:30 comes around and I ask the busser if we should also order dinner as our sashimi apps and nigari comes. He says yes. 8:30, the forgotten sweet shrimp arrives. We just ask for the check... hello $100. The food was beautiful, yes, the service and care na-da. Home now and actually heating up some leftovers for dinner b/c this anniversary dinner turned into an expensive beer, saki, and app.",

The waiter said they are leaning to a limited sushi menu... What?  The menus were handed to us like a 6th grader's homework.  All laminated separated pieces of paper.  Horrible.  I ordered the Tempura udon.. Not worth the 8$ considering the big bowl was not filled with soup in it.  Waste of money!  I was given a teaspoon for the soup... WTF.  We also ordered the beef and sushi plate-  sushi was falling apart with no flavor.  We were so disappointed and to top it off you leave there smelling like an Asian market still hungry and sad you spent $ here!  If you want over priced nasty Japanese food stop by.  Or just head to Oink and get your money's worth.  Boo!  I'm surprised this place is in business.",

The best was the clams in garlic sauce -- once you eat the clams, they take the sauce back and whip it up into like a quick fire Japanese risotto -- yummy and you feel you're getting your money's worth.    We want to go back for omakase sometime soon. Definitely a new fav!!",

It came with a small iceberg and tomato salad topped with fried onion and a delicious tangy, sesame dressing and a bowl of miso (due to my Norri aversion, this was wasted on me) In the end, my three fair-sized, cone-shaped rolls and a diet coke ran me around $15.

It took more than 45 minutes for an order of four rolls: a rainbow roll, california roll, and two spicy tuna rolls.  To make matters worse, people who came in more than half an hour after us got their food and were done before we even got our rolls!    The rolls, once they did finally arrive, were less than one-inch in diameter (i.e., less than half the size of rolls at most similar restaurants) and consisted mostly of rice and vegetables.  The only thing we did enjoy was the shrimp ordered from the \"japanese tapas\" menu, which tasted outstanding.    However we will never go back here, based on the horrible service and indifferent attitude of the staff.",

We ordered something from the menu which was not as indicated by the title. When we asked them to take it back because it was not what we ordered, they refused. All in all, we spent two hours here with very little service from our waiter and after $65 went away still hungry.  Before we left, the waiter insulted our tastes as being more akin to Red Lobster. I kid you not. Talk about unprofessional. My wife used to work in a high-end sushi restaurant and was furious at the lack of professionalism and respect shown to us.  I'm not sure how this place has such high reviews. Do not go to to Yasu unless you want overpriced, bland sushi from waiters with bad attitudes.  If you want really amazing sushi, go to Harumi Sushi (114 W Adams St, 85003)/.",

This isn't your typical sushi place where you can order a few rolls, pay $25 and be in and out in 30 minutes. In fact, rolls aren't even on their menu anymore. They've gone to a more traditional Japanese menu, and in my opinion they are forcing a fine dining experience on the patron even though this is a small joint in a strip mall. By \"forcing\" I mean that they go to lengths to recommend their multi-course meals, steering you away from what you might want to what they want you to want, then they take their sweet time serving you each course. There's nothing wrong with this, but you should expect it, not to mention the fine dining prices as well. As much as I like sushi, I think $16 for seasonal nigiri is a bit much. I now treat Yasu's like Morton's steak house: a rare treat that drains my wallet.",

Once we were seated we told the server we were in a rush and if that was a problem. He instructed us on what was best to order in a rush. We placed our order immediately, just 2 of us and a very simple order. After 25 minutes the sushi roll came out and 5 minutes after that, the edamame. I asked about my meal and he said any minute. He had already brought us our bill and I paid. 5 minutes later he came to tell me that my chicken had not even been \"dumped in the fryer yet.\"  I immediately asked him to refund my credit card. He didn't even comp our meal and was quite rude about it. For the restaurant being over half empty and it being a Monday night, there was no excuse and I left without ever getting dinner. Horrible service and would never go back.",

Sat at the sushi bar because the place is pretty small and we did not want to wait real long. Yasu was behind the sushi bar and these middle aged Japenese Lady Groupies were talking to him and were so loud I wanted to stuff a sushi roll in their mouth to muffle them down. The food was great and the waitress was very helpful in our selection since it was our first time there and there are 4+ menus to order off of. Will be back here and look forward to the next new food to try. One of the better Japanese Restaurants in Phoenix.",

Walking in to the restaurant, you are greeted by the entire kitchen staff shouting something in japanese - it's fun and welcoming! The environment is very classy, but people can be wearing casual to dressy attire.  There are a variety of seating options, from regular tables, to booths, to sofa chairs, to benches.  A few patio seats as well.  Now on to the highlight - the food!  Disclaimer- I am not a huge sushi fan, though I will eat and enjoy it occasionally, but Yasu's has so much beyond sushi and it is all amazing! I usually order off of the tapas menu.  The pork belly bun is my absolute favorite, incredibly delicious.  The house green beans have a sauce that is so delicious I could order two of those generous servings and have that be my whole meal (if it weren't for the fact that I'd be missing out on all the other amazing options!).  My new favorite are the bacon wrapped dates - the perfect mixture of sweet and savory.  The asparagus with egg was good too.  I've tried probably 5 or 6 other menu items as well, and it's all on the range of good to great to absolutely amazing. I am so happy to have found such amazing Japanese food here in Phoenix!",

They have $5.00 tapas, hard to choose which ones to pick. I had a baked cheesy scallop (my apologies for not remembering the correct name) and seared ahi. I wanted a roll as well so they accommodated my request for a Las Vegas roll even though it was not on the menu (and yes I know I really should venture out, but it sounded perfect, and it was). Pictures to follow.   The only things that turned me off were the laminated \"lunch specials\" (as an industry person, I feel like at a certain price point laminated menus are not acceptable) and no wine specials for lunch, only Sake. Again I understand in a Japanese restaurant I should drink Sake but I like what I like, and might I add my Prosecco complemented my meal perfectly.  Stick with the specials and you will have a tiny bill, venture out and plan on paying.",

I was blown away by how great this place was - and it's in a STRIP MALL!  I would have never picked it out unless i lived in the neighborhood.    We had sooooo much food.  We ordered several apps, oysters, rolls - and were so impressed by the chef that when we wanted to add more, we told the waitress to have him surprise us.  Their special rolls are inventive and unique - the Red Roll was my favorite.  The sashimi was incredibly fresh and high quality.    We were visiting for a long weekend, and loved it so much we ended up going back again 2 nights later.  Had to get my Yasu fix while I could!  I will definitely be going back the next time I'm in Phoenix.",

    "text": "This has to be my favorite sushi joint in the Valley.  As a real-life Japanese American, I am extremely finicky when it comes to good sushi -- something I'm finding is rare in Phoenix.    I am a sushi purist.  You will never find me ordering anything with cream cheese in it or California rolls.  When I first entered, I had my doubts as the decor seemed to be another trendy wannabe sushi joint.  A first look at the menu revealed a nice mix of pure sushi and fusion rolls.  I usually order the amaebi (sweet shrimp) and uni (sea urchin) as a good indicator of freshness.  Yasu did not disappoint.  The uni was creamy and vibrant while the amaebi was traditionally served with shrimp heads.  My wife ordered the Phoenix Roll.  As a traditionalist, I'm typically against ordering this type of sushi, but heck it was my anniversary.  I couldn't deny that the ingredients were fresh and delicious and ultimately it does come down to the food.  For the entree, I usually eat the chicken teriyaki.  The slightly charred outside and the aromatics from the charcoal were excellent and even a tad better than my grandma used to make (sorry, grandma).  My wife had the grilled black snapper.  Took long but definitely worth the wait.  I don't know who the grillmaster is, but it was masterfully done from how the fish was cooked to the salt they used to garnish.  Unlike other yelpers, I have not yet experienced a problem with service.  My server was knowledgeable and helpful and kept our glasses filled.  It could be tough to get a seat if you don't call ahead.  There's something for everything here at Yasu (except maybe for Vegetarians).  I'd urge you to try something different and expand your concept of Japanese food.  At Yasu, it's easy to be adventurous because the food is FRESH.  Save the California rolls for Ra or Kabuki.",

With Sea Saw closing, it's definitely my favorite place for Japanese food in town and one of my very favorites regardless of type.  The last few times we'd gone, we went omakase and had a variety of of his excellent sushi and creative cooked dishes. We love the Sumibiyaki (nice to get Wagyu too) and can never get enough foie gras.  For some reason tonight, we ended up doing mostly sushi (which I also always love).  I also typically sit at the sushi bar and as I was with friends, we were at a table this night.  At Yasu, if you're not doing omakase, you've gotta start with the specials handout.  We stared there & barely left it. It's hard to resist when you know that is what the chef recommends that day.  We started with a killer red snapper carpaccio drizzled in hot sesame oil, soy sauce, and ginger. Superyum...  Then we did a series of nigiri sushi: bluefin toro, kampachi, aji, Chilean abalone, uni, live amaebi. Everything was wonderful. Super fresh. Amazing. If I had to pick favorites, would go with the uni, live amaebi and the Chilean abalone.  We also did a plate of yellowtail sashimi w/sliced jalapeno. Yummy.   And then we finished off with a chef's special dish of seared salmon wrapped around shiso, some julienne radishes, etc. It was also topped with ponzu sauce. Wonderful dish.  Anyway, it's only been 3 days and I already feel like I'm way overdue for my next visit.",

Melt in your mouth perfection.   They don't do happy hour, but the prices end up being very reasonable for what you get. I tried their baby yellow tail and a huge piece of clam. Tasty!   Yasu is small, so get there early. The place can fill up quick! I love the atmosphere inside. The service is superb and the staff is uber-friendly.

    "text": "I agree with the other reviews, Yasu serves some of the best Japanese food in Phoenix.  The formula of fresh high quality ingredients, authentic preparation, artful presentation, modern yet unpretentious decor, friendly service and reasonable prices is destined for success.  Having spoiled my taste buds in Tokyo eating sushi every week for 5 months at Tsukiji, the world's biggest fish market, it's been hard to find satisfying sushi, especially in Phoenix.    I was delighted to see fishes imported from Japan on the menu, like spanish mackerel (aji) which I've seen only at the best sushi restaurants.  We order it as sashimi - the slices were presented next to the bones of the fish (head to tail intact) with ginger and chopped green onions.  The fish was fresh and full of flavor.    After we finished the dish, the waiter took the bones back to be deep-fried.  This is as authentic as it gets - the Japanese waste nothing.  If you can get past your squirmishness of eating fish brains, this is the ultimate crunchy treat.  Unfortunately, ankimo (monkfish liver) - one of my favorite raw dishes - creamy without being fishy served traditionally with ponzu sauce - was out that day.  We had the succulent kumamoto oysters, which were also served with ponzu, instead.  The grilled yellowtail (hamachi) filet and collar (hamachi kama) were both perfect - grilled patiently over oak charcoals until the exterior was wonderfully crispy while the interior stayed deliciously moist.  I generally prefer hamachi kama because it's oiler and more tender but the presentation of the filet was quite dramatic - long plate with fried root chips on one end and ponzu sauce with grated radish on the other.    Grilling like this does take time so be prepared to wait 20-30 min for this dish.  Quicker grilled dishes include the giant scallops wrapped in bacon and tasty lamb chops.  We also ordered the beef tongue but somehow the waiter never entered it in.  We also ordered a childhood favorite: cornflake shrimp - jumbo sized shrimp rolled in cornflakes and deepfried, served with a homemade tartar sauce.  We loved the variety on the menu and can't wait to go back to try more dishes, esp the ankimo and grilled tongue.",

    "text": "my first yelp! review, and it's because of Yasu...I decided to take my friend here for her birthday based all the great reviews. She loves sushi and I was looking for a great place out of (north) Scottsdale and the seen/be seen crowd that tends to exist in that area.  Wow! What a great place. Service - wonderful - impeccable, menu selection - wonderful, food - wonderful. We sat at the bar to wait for a table and the bartender suggested a few items to try since we hadn't been there. Happy to say I listened and was thoroughly impressed - the black cod was absolutely delicious. I will definitely go back . Oh, and my friend's drink, the appletini, she said was probably the best she's had (it's a Ringotini with a little something extra). We even got a little Japanese language lesson :)  If you go - Make a reservation! I didn't realize they took reservations so waited, however the wait wasn't long at all. Great place for a date, or friends and even family.",

Me, short bus; you, Memory genius? I don't know.  Second, my mumsy-poo and I went here, and she's a tough nut to crack. She practically raised me on sushi and doesn't fall for the upper-upper crap that a lot of these places try to make themselves out to be. (Read: We're stereotypical Jews; we don't want to pay a lot, but we want the whole cow.)  That said, the service was a bit slow, but the woman was pretty slammed and alone in the place, so I'm only yanking one star. She was totally gracious and apologetic, and if I were rating her, she'd get a five, but the restaurant should have at least 2 servers on at lunch. Also, no ingredients for bloody marys. Wah wah.   The food, though, was AWESOME. We had the sashimi combo, and the pieces of fish were HUUUUUGE! And tasty. We also crammed down dessert and were pleasantly confused about this sweet crepe business at a sushi joint.  We're glad we went; though it was a hair expensive for the location (North Phoenix/PV Mall area isn't exactly a mecca for delicious eateries... prove me wrong, yelpers!).  Picky Jew mom digs it, so Yasu succeeds.",

This is a cozy and very hip place stuck in a strip mall but don't let the location deter you from it's fantastic food. The hamachi covered with jalapeno pieces was so excellent as the hamachi slices just melted in my mouth. All the sushi we had (spicy salmon rolls, rainbow rolls, tuna, salmon) tasted so fresh and every bite was like heaven. (Salivating as I recall my food there.) The only thing there that wasn't so impressive was their special Jidori chicken - that was good, but not too memorable.  Service was extremely nice and helpful.  Bottom line: Sushi heaven in Phoenix area. It's a small place so make sure you have a reservation.",

This place is as good as I've had in any city in the country.  The menu selection is plentiful with a nice variety of hot dishes and sushi.    We sat at the bar and were pleasantly greeted.  The chef asked us our names and then we found our the owner Yasu was going to be preparing our sushi.  He was very nice and gave us a few suggestions.  After a little small talk he broke out the good wasabi and told us to not bother with the original.  For all of you who haven't had the real stuff it is VERY different from the lime green paste.    All of the sushi was tip top, fish was fresh and tasty. Also he uses ponzu on a few items and I'm a huge sucker for that goodness.    You must try the scallop wrapped in bacon, it was ridiculous.  The scallops were about as big as my palm!    Anyway, I could ramble forever so get your butt over there and get the Japanese food you deserve.",

Do not come here for take out or if you're rushed...common complaints from other reviewers... because Yasu's is a FINE dining establishment and should be treated as such. Everything is made fresh and with obvious care. The service is also fantastic, our waiter yesterday was very knowledgeable and recommended some new items that turned out to be delicious.

Really nice ambiance to the place, service is great- friendly.  The menu was lengthy--and I wanted to try just about everything but realized, one step at a time. I got my favorite miso soup and here its the real deal, nothing watered down real soft delicious tofu, scallions, not too salty- just right.  I got some tamago, nigiritoro, yasu roll and maguro nigiri... Wow... amazing stuff right there, especially the toro, delicious unctuous tuna- the tamago was spot on. Everything was exceptionally fresh, I wanted to try sumibiyaki or desert but I could barely move at this point!   Im snacking on my edamame- and will be going back again, I wish it was slightly cheaper but for this quality- worth it. By far the best sushi i've had in phoenix followed by hiro sushi !",

It used to be that business trips to unknown locales would result in poor to middling eating experiences at some wheel-of-fortune restaurant near the hotel.  With the help of Yelp, my partner and I were able to find outstanding food despite rarely having ventured into Phoenix before.  Finding Yasu Sushi Bistro was certainly a great way to end our Arizona experience; and with awesome sushi no less.  The nigiri pieces were wonderfully fresh -- a very welcome and unexpected pleasure -- and the black cod miso was the hit of the night.  Furthermore, the service was wonderful as we were treated to the enthusiasm and knowledge of our great server.  Regretfully, I'm not sure if her name is spelled with a \"K\" or a \"C\" but either way, having the infinitely helpful Cali -- \"like Cauliflower\" -- was the cherry on top of a great meal.

I had at least one of the following: Sapporo - Can it ever be bad?  It was served very cold.  Thumbs up. Green Tea - Good.  Good service on the refills also. Edamame - Good.  Right amount of salt. Miso - Interesting wooden bowl and wooden spoon.  It tasted good, tho. Yellow Tail, Salmon, Tuna, Albacore, Uni, FW Eel,  Kampachi nigiri.  Good stuff on all of those.  They also have \"Yasu style\" nigiri for some types, and they are good.  It usually involves ponzu on top. Spicy Tuna and Softshell Crab roll.  SSC was great!  Service was pretty good and sushi was also good.  The bar was full but I wish I could have eaten there.  The sushi chefs were friendly and talkative to the people at the bar, which is unusual (at least compared to LA).  The base quality of the fish, outside of whatever ponzu, soy, wasabi and other ingredients were on it, was pretty good, but I wouldn't say 5 stars.  Since I generally judge a place wholly on the food, I give it 4.5.  Failing that, I rounded up!",

    "text": "I am in deep smit. This place rawks. It's not the ultimate dining experience I have ever had but the sushi is phenomenal! First off, the sushi chefs are actually Japanese and not Korean, Chinese or... we'll just say North American and leave it at that. Secondly I asked my test question (What is good for sashimi tonight?) and he immediately answered 'My favorite is the Japanese Red Snapper' (which I've never had). I was slightly dubious as this was the daily special but it was good. Freakin good. Slap yo momma good as my LA friend likes to say.  I was also slightly put off because the rolls weren't described anywhere. I asked my waitress (who was cutesy and attentive) about this and she provided me with this alien looking quintopod with little cards describing a few (five to be exact) of the roll contents. The Red Roll was the only thing that sounded good, but boy was it delish!  I followed with tuna sashimi that was definitely some of the best tuna I've had. I also tried the 'new' beer on the list Echigo which starts kind of like a premium American amber (like Fat Tire) but finishes like traditional Japanese lager. It was lovely and has me hoping it will be available more places soon.  The place is definitely not perfect and I can see what the other reviewer said about small tables and multiple menus (I was treated to 5). It's also probably not a great place to take a date unless they love sushi as much as I do. In fact ditch your date and take me instead!  But to me food reigns supreme. I'll sit on a bucket in a leaky tent to eat fabulous food and this was fabulous. I ate there over 12 hours ago and I'm still having food orgasm aftershocks.  The prices were reasonably high for a sushi place, but you definitely get what you pay for. I had the red snapper sashimi, red roll, tuna sashimi, more red snapper sashimi :D, and unagi for dessert, plus two beers and it came out to $75 before tip. Worth. Every. Penny.",

    "text": "Well, hate to join the bandwagon, but this place is the real deal! I went here based on Yelp reviews, which after almost a dozen, averaged 5 stars! But several were from newbies to sushi, so I was skeptical, even with a recent ROTD. Had to try for myself.  Yasu's is in the Target/REI mall on the corner of East Cactus and Paradise Valley Parkway West, on the edge of Scottsdale and PV, adjacent the Army Recruiting office!   The restaurant is immediately recognizable as Japanese owned, by its tasteful and elegant decor in subdued natural tones of wood and stone colors. Clean, modern, with understated class and attention to detail. It isn't large, with only 10 tables inside, 8 4s, a cozy 2 by the sushi bar, and a 6 in front of it, with a small L shaped stool bar next to the sushi bar which only has 2 benches seating 2 each. Outside are 3 more tables in a fenced patio with Tiki lamps aburning. There is a hostess, a Japanese floor manager, several youthful Eurasian servers, and a mostly Latino kitchen staff. Yasu and Takeshi do all the sushi behind the sushi bar, and pace each diner well.   They specialize in a daily special menu. Samples for a Friday night included: - Kampachi (baby yellowtail) $12 - Kumamoto Oysters (half shel or Sumibi) $10 - Aji (Spanish Mackerel) or Striped Jack sushi or sashimi ($5.5/$12 and $7.5/$16 respectively) - Whole Black Snapper (from the Sumibi Yaki Grill) $20 - Saikyo Beef Tongue ($8) - Grilled Pike ($8.5) - Grilled Squid Surume ($13.5) - 5 oz Wagyu ($75) - Cornflake Shrimp w/Tartar Sauce ($8.5) - Karaage Black Snapper ($22) - Sake or Miso Steamed Manila Clams ($8.5/$9) - Foie Gras w/ Japanese Eggplant $13.5  Obviously from other reviews, many of these are standard faire daily.   Sushi is moderately priced, with basic Nigiri from $4.5 - $5; Exceptions are sweet shrimp ($8), Crab Leg ($6.5) Uni and Mirugai ($7.5). Sashimi are reasonable from $7.5 - $10. Rolls from $4 (Maki type) up to $12 max (hand styled).   I went for a $50 Omakase (I count on you, chef) and Takeshi went to work.   1. Duo Cherrystone Clams on half shell atop its own caligraphy covered ceramic charcoal hotpot, garnished with minced green onions, fresh ginger and a dab of spicy tuna mix, doused with Ponzu sauce, taken to a boil in front of you. OMG! AYKM? ($7.5) 2. Crystal white Himame (Fluke) fish garnished with minced green onions, morsels of katsuyaboshi (bonita shavings), ponzu, and shaped and decorated to look like a mini sperm whale with eyes and gills ($5.5) 3. Hard to find Striped Jack (Shimajii) red striped white fish au natural ($7.5) 4. Saba (Mackerel) served without garnish ($4.5) 5. Seki-Saba (special mackerel only bought in 2 places in Japan, just arrived today) $6 (smoothest, melt like butter Mackerel you will find!) 6. Sake (Salmon) Yasu Style: Scored, seared on the Sumibi Yaki Grill for a smokey flavor, sprinked with ponzu sauce (don't dip into shoyu/wasabi!). Best tasting salmon I have had! Soft and flavorful! ($4.5) 7. 4 inch long narrow hand roll filled with buttery Uni and a hint of spice ($7.5)  Total with $6 large Asahi Super Dry: $49.  I waited 20 minutes for the sushi bar, and as it happens that I was a single, another single came nearly simultaneously, and we talked, shared sushi, and with Japanese politeness, poured each other's drinks. I shared sushi, and they shared Seared Scallop Carpaccio, which were about 8 small sand dollar sized scallop slices, very tender and white, garnished with minced negi, katsuyoboshi, and ponzu.  I complimented Takeshi (Umai, Oishikatta, Subarashii!) and left him a $20 bill because I was so happy! (I tipped the wait staff, too)  Anything Asian with \"Bistro\" in the name makes me a bit nervous that it is some convaluted Fusion Crap joint trying too hard to be Hip and Chic. Not the case here!  Yasu's rivals other sushi-ya in LA, SD, SF, LV and Seattle, and costs less than ones of equal quality and creativity. I highly recommend it!",

    "text": "OK, so I don't normally blog like this, but I've just gotta write about this place.  Yasu Sushi Bistro.  The most amazing resturaunt experience I've had in a long time and probably my new favorite place.  Hiding in a strip mall in PV (53rd St & Cactus) is this brand new, upscale little sushi/sumibiyaki joint.  Introduced to me by my wonderful friend Eric.  I met Ryan Kim who showed us the best of the best they have.  First off, atmosphere was great, dim light but not too dark, interesting but delightful music selection, eclectic but themed art selections hanging.  Small patio area outside and just a handful of tables inside.  I passed up the delightful list of sake for the night and started off with edamame, very fresh tasting with just the right amount of salt.  Eric had the miso, which looked quite good for just soup, I hear it's all made from scratch, so no wonder.  We ordered the Power and Phoenix rolls after Ryan explained what was what (my Japanese isn't much of anything yet).  Also after reading the New Times review I was eagerly looking for the Washu.  Ryan also informed us that they have quit stocking it and went for a higher grade, Wagyu. I was now anticipating this even more after hearing how this is the most tender meat in the world, right above Kobe.  The beef was the first to arrive, on a long neat platter served with garlic chips, cut into small cubes, and lightly sea salted.  Alongside the tray came a small bincho-tan fed ceramic grill.  I'm still trying ti find the name of the grill, so please anyone knowledgeable, fill me in. The bincho-tan being imported from Japan along with the grill itself and the beef just made for an immensly unique experience, at least here in the states. The warmth of the grill and pleasant aroma of the charcoal was just the beginning.  Using our chopsticks, we grill the meat tabletop to perfection.  We were told that we're just the second people to try the new menu item so the staff was watching for reactions.  After being built up to this moment, it was surprising to find that it really was everything they said and more than I was expecting.  The look on my face was all head chef Yasu needed to know to understand how satisfied I was.  Words cannot describe it, but this was the best tasting meat I've ever had, so tender, juicy, melt in your mouth amzing flavor.  Yasu even stepped out from behind the counter, brought a small bowl of lemons and told us to just drip a bit on the cooking meat to flare up the charcoal and get more flavor from the smoke.  Wow!!! Again, even better, I was in heaven.  Our rolls arrived alonside and order of calamari.  Each roll had such unique flavor and distinction from every other place I've been.  You can tell what care has been given into making each item.  The calamari was not rubbery or tough unlike others.  Normally it's just a side, but now it made me stop and revel in it's taste as well.  Just when we thought we couldn't go any further though, Ryan suggested dessert.  Ok, I thought, why not.  Red Bean/Banana spring rolls sounded good, but with their opinion we also tried the new item, green tea cheesecake fondue.  I was glad for the second, a small burner with a combo of white/milk chocolate came paired with skewers of soft green cheesecake for dipping.  Crumbled nuts and bananas on the tray just enhanced the flavor as this truly was a dessert I would not have wanted to miss.  I know my words are not those of a food critic, but just trust me, you HAVE to try this place to understand how remarkable and different it is.  By far not just another sushi joint (which I barely got in to but saw other plates go by and wanted them too, nigiri and sashimi).  I cannot wait to return and will accompany anyone who wants to make the trip.",

    "text": "Yasu Bistro came highly regarded as one of the best in town. Was it? Maybe...maybe not. Me and the lady gnome, came in at 8pm on a Thursday, their signage said they closed at 9:30. Decor was nice, simple, sheik. The server looked a little like Napolean Dynamite, and what's more was dressed a little like him too. I'm assuming this was Yasu's contribution to the \"casual hip\" atmosphere. I'm completely willing to overlook the white kid serving sushi bit...but the two sizes too small out dated concert T and the ripped jeans he borrowed from his sister, didn't quite match the decor in my opinion...I digress. After being handed the 4 or so menus to each of us, we take a second to look around. Place is tiny, dark, ambient. Sushi bar takes up one third of the entire dining room, young sushi chef with the hip hair, governing the attention of 3 or so, what was presumably either regulars or staff getting off of work, didnt seem to even notice we had been sat.  I ask a question about one of the wines on the list, I ask what the blend in the blend is...He proceeds to tell me that the blend is Pinot Gris, Chardonnay...and he thinks Pinot Grigio. Now granted I'm a wine guy, and certainly don't expect every tom dick and hairy to understand that Pinot Gris and Pinot Grigio to be the exact same grape...but really kid, noones going to eat your lunch if you just tell us you dont know, lol. For Christs sakes Napolean dont tell me that the salad has iceberg lettuce blended with some Iceberg lettuce!  Went with a shiso martini from the bar, inventive...if a little clumsy in the execution, but love the fact that they took a risk here. ( I love Shiso), ordered a small bottle of Sake to share.  As we give the server our initial order, he immediately tells us that because they are closing, would it be ok if we put in our entire order right now? Huh?..but ..your sign says you dont close for another hour and a half...ah I see, closing early today because it's been slow and there are no guests... HELLO! we're right here and ready to spend money! Are we not hip enough, are our shirts not tight enough, our hair not T&G enough? **As an aside, the whole we close when we want to mentality has always irked me a little...you want to tell people that your open till 9:30pm...stay open till 9:30pm** BAH...the economy sucks, I get it....all the more reason to not rush out your only guests in the dining room. Anyhoo, we do our best to estimate all that we'll be wanting and order in full, then the server lets us know, that the Sushi might take a while (because the sushi chef, with one knee up leaning forward in wrapt conversation with his audience of three was obviously terribly busy.) , would it be ok to bring out the kitchen stuff first...suuuure, why not, lol.  Alright enough, you get the picture....lets talk about the food:  The menu was inventive and heavliy influenced by the Japanese Omakase, (think lots of little plates) style. The problem I think with this style and the whole trendy Tapas phenomenon is that, regrettably more often than not..these \"smaller\" plates just aren't coming with \"smaller\" prices. With the closing of several great \"small plate\" concepts within the last month *bye bye See Saw :( ...I think our society in this economic downturn is starting to see that.  Foie Gras with Japanese Eggplant. Delicious? Yes Sir! Was the tiny foie gras and the one tiny Japanese Eggplant sliced lengthwise and set on either side of the foie gras dwarved and humiliated by the abnormally long plate that didnt even fit on the table? Yes Sir!  Sashimi, was well cut...fish was fresh tasting. (as fresh as frozen fish can be, after making the trip to AZ) no complaints there though. Presentations were inventive, nice blend of classic and noveau techniques. Alltogether pleasing, if maybe a little overpriced.  Should you try this place? I think so....there were enough nice characteristics about the place, and definitely enough positive feedback heard that makes me want to believe we just caught them at the wrong time...Would we personally go back? Not until the economy gets better....we'd hate to have to rush out again...if we should lets say not be able to make it earlier than 2 hours before closing.",

    "text": "I have relatives out in Phoenix, so I always go out to Arizona for Thanksgiving. Arizona is not exactly a culinary Mecca, and I'm not a big fan of turkey dinners (don't crucify me for being un-American), so by the end of Thanksgiving, I'm usually desperate for a good meal. Usually, after a big heavy Thanksgiving meal, I'm so burnt out that I want something simple and clean, like Japanese food.   Unfortunately, in Arizona, a good Japanese meal is hard to find as most sushi restaurants are all about the dragon-uppercut-rolls and crispy-dynamite-ju-ju-mojo-and-the-kitchen-sink crap made by sake-bomb pounding \"sushi chefs\" who think Japanese cuisine must always include a squirt from a bottle of Sriracha hot sauce and a helping of mayonnaise.  So when my brother-in-law recommended Yasu, I was more than a bit skeptical, having gone to his other recommendations in the past. Fortunately, after dragging him to all the good Japanese restaurants in LA this summer, I think he's finally developed a good sense of what Japanese food is all about.  To put it simply, Yasu is probably the best Japanese restaurant in Arizona. I sat at the counter in front of the owner/chef, Yasu-san, and asked what the omakase course included. He explained that it includes a sampling of sashimi, yakimono (grilled items), and sushi. Couldn't have asked for anything better after an overdose of dry turkey.   We started with kumamoto oysters with a light ponzu sauce. The oysters were very fresh--I'm a huge oyster fan so I like my oysters simple, but I can see others liking the flavor combinations of the ponzu and the green onions with their oysters. Next came hamaguri shichirin-yaki (large clams grilled over hot coals). The big, juicy pieces of clam grilling in their own juice with a hint of soy sauce were simple yet divine. Fresh sashimi followed which included some nice pieces of chu-toro, sweet shrimp, and huge Boston scallops, all of which were devoured as soon as the plate was down. The scallops were really sweet and succulent. Yasu-san explained that he gets it shipped directly from the fisherman in Boston.  The charcoal grilled course started off with tomato and asparagus wrapped in bacon (pretty good), followed by what's got to be the best tsukune (chicken meat ball) I've ever had in the US. And I'm pretty picky when it comes to tsukune. The minced chicken meat is chunky and retains the great texture of chicken, and the yakitori sauce is nice and restrained, allowing the smoky flavors of the binchotan (Japanese hardwood charcoal) to come through. Yasu-san actually imports all of his charcoal from Japan as its low smoke and high heat is optimal for grilling. He then served beef tongue marinated in miso. This, along with the tsukune was the highlight of the night. When I saw the thick cuts of beef tongue, I envisioned 30 minutes of chewing as big pieces of tongue tend to be tough, but I was completely wrong. Tender, tasty, absolutely wonderful. When I complimented the chef on how good these were, he grinned and told me that it's tender because he only uses the back of the tongue--the tip tends to be really tough.  I was getting pretty full at this point, but out came seared scallops--the chef probably noticed how much I liked the scallops. I was pretty full, but god, were these scallops good! We really must have come on the right day.  At this point, I was stuffed, so Yasu-san prepared four pieces of sushi to finish the meal. Now, this was the only disappointment of the night. The sashimi and everything else were so good, I expected the sushi to be just as good. Unfortunately, the pieces of tuna and salmon weren't very flavorful, and the unagi was a bit on the dry side. The rice was a bit underseasoned as well. It was somewhat of a disappointing finish after otherwise and excellent meal, but it was okay since I was pretty much stuffed to the gills at that point.   Having so many different types of dishes, I can see why they decided to call it a Japanese bistro rather than a sushi restaurant. Although their sushi was not at the level of top sushi restaurants in Socal, I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone who's in the Phoenix area looking for excellent Japanese food.  For the purists, they may be put off by some of their dishes, which do cater to the masses, such as their rolls and \"dynamite\". But I assure you that their non-Americanized dishes are solid.",

The food is very unique in that you are not getting your traditional bento box with salad, miso, and chicken teriyaki.   They have $5 tapas menu before 7 PM.  The lamb chop is amazing.  Expect to spend about $50+ per person.",

    "text": "Yasu Sushi Bistro is located in close proximity to the Paradise Valley Mall.  I highly recommend that you start with Sweet Shrimp and the duck sampler.  For the entree, I highly recommend the grilled black sea bass. The bass is grilled to a near char -- yet beneath the skin, the meat is white, moist, and flavorful. The bass is accompanied with a uniquely flavored sauce.  Sashimi/Sushi prices range from about $6 to $15. Entrees range from about $17 to $75 for the Wagyu beef (approximate). The grilled black sea bass is about $20.  Of all the Japanese/Sushi restaurants in Phoenix, Yasu Sushi Bistro is at the top of my list.",

The service was also somewhat slow because they were busy.  There are better options out there.   If I had to make a recommendation I would say try either Fresh Wasabi or Tokyo Lobby.  However, both are on the West side.   I felt Yasu Sushi was overpriced for what we got.",

All of the residual stress from a bad day at work evaporated like the haze of water droplets from a mister on a hot Phoenix summer day, leaving me feeling cool, calm and content.  Oh yes, Yasu did not just meet my expectations, it exceeded them.  And I am hard to please.",

The selection of fish and seafood was by far one of the best specializing in more rare plates (usually more common to real sushi bars).  I had thier oysters,(amazing), giant clam which is not as scary as it sounds, monkfish live pate (very good not for the faint at heart), plus many other delicacies.  They were all good each in their own way.  We tried okamase (I hope I spelled that right) and the owner came over and introduced himself to us.  He told us that his resturaunt was all about bringing some of his favorite dishes to az that he enjoyed while growing up in Japan.  I have to say it was expensive but well worth the whole experience and I will be back!!!!",

However this place has the most extensive menu I've seen at a Japanese restaurant that is known as a sushi bar. The ambiance in the place is really romantic at night with dim lighting, nice music, and delicate plating. All the little details in the decor, like placing the chopsticks on a polished river rock was beautiful. Their menu offered everything from chicken and beef to lots of seafood. I ordered chicken teriyaki and it was delish. Their sauce tasted homemade and was lighter then most which I loved. It came plated nicely. I also had their tempura which was light and airy as it should be. The dipping sauce, also heavenly. My man seemed to enjoy his sushi and it looked nice as well. Overall it's pricey compared to other sushi places, however the ambiance of the restaurant and upscale choices on the menu make it worth it.",
