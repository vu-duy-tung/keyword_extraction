NO \"i am sorry for the wait, let me see whats taking so long.\" Nothing. I replied with you have three minutes or I want a refund. Well 5 goes by, Ok I want a refund. It took about another 5 minutes for him to get permission from his \"manager\" whom may or may not have even graduated high school. At this point I have been robbed 1 hour of my life, with no apologizes, with no interaction with management, or any  sense of customer service.   There would be a zero star here if i had the option. Absolutely yummy food, when properly serviced.  I mean their was not one single resemblance of an adult in this establishment. Its like they all got high in the back and had no sense of time, or surroundings. I understand if you have a few new people that you are training. But WTF.... Oh and on the way out some one told me calm down...Me calm down you robbed my of an hour of my life, made me hungrier than what i was, and told me to calm down. That is not how you deescalate a situation.  Never again Honey bears will I treat you to my hard earned money. And frankly the gentleman before me should have been more furious than me, he called in his order and sandwich with whatever side, you handed him a bag with a side of sauce, no apologizes for him or any of your other LOYAL customers. Dam I am MAD.                                     Thanks for nothing,                                                         Augustina AKA ROBBED",

RIGHT. It's as though they simply boil the meat, take it out of the water and pour sauce on it...really basic sauce at that. The Mac and Cheese reminded me of Kraft's stove top Mac and Cheese.  Apparently they're doing something right for somebody to stay business for this many years. Hell even I came back knowing I wouldn't like it. Maybe subconsciously I remembered how much you get for your money. I'll be having the second half for lunch today.",

Why is there a line on the receipt for a tip when you aren't served anything. We got our own drinks, napkins, straws, spoons, food, and sauce. So why is there room for a tip? Now the food. My husband ordered the 5dollar ribs with fries and mac and cheese. The sauce was too spicy for bbq sauce for us it overpowered the meat flavor. All you could taste was the sauce which was not a good thing. The mac and cheese was very bland and tasteless. I had the butterfly shrimp which was the special of the day and mac and cheese as well. Th e butterfly shrimp was pretty tasteless as well. It was okay, nothing special about it. We left unsatisfied and disappointed also a little grossed out. My husband started feeling sick as we were leaving.. I think the best part was the fries and they weren't all that great either. The food was definitely not worth the price.. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",

    "text": "Honey Bear.  What a great name. I wish I would have named my first son Honey Bear, or Cornbread J-Cool...something sick like that.  I think that's where going into labor fucks most women up.  They're all like...\"Oh yeah baby, I'm down with Luciano or Vincenzo if its a boy... sooo very Italian.\"  That's in the nine months preceding birth.   Have a little chat with her after she delivers...it's a whole new ball game. Now it's all, \"My son isn't going to have a name that sounds like some greaseball mobster, WTF is the matter with you anyway?\"  Wow. I don't know how I went down that road. I WAS going to tell you about Honey Bear's but I guess I'm still pissed my first born was named Dan.   Anyway, the food here is pretty tasty. I like it because you can order meat by the pound which is all I ever do. I order eight ounces of barbecued beef, no bun and a glass of water..it's around eight bucks. The service is super fast too, consuming about fifteen minutes of your lunch hour if you wolf your shit like I do.  Their sauce is flavorful too, you'll want to slather a boatload on your beef...kind of sweet and slightly spicy...good tang.   And speaking of good tang, what better way to finish off the remainder of your lunch hour than by going to Band Aid's show lounge...just a block away on 7th and Virginia?  A lunch hour chocked with tang. The fantasy of what heights your son may have aspired to had you gotten your way...naming him Cornbread. And crop-dusting that empty cubicle with some major beef and beer farts around mid afternoon...sending that evil co-worker of yours into a catatonic funk upon her return from the ladies room.  Now that's what I'm talking about.",

My friend placed a phone order, we were told the order would be ready at 7:30 so that is when we showed up to pick it up, however they had not even started putting the order together.  The worker had me pay first.  When the order finally came  I was asked to go through the bag myself to ensure I had everything I hd ordered.  Remember I did not place the order.  Isn't it a given they would have my order written down?  The worker was not rude but he was indifferent.    What is the point of phone orders if your not going to prepare the order until the person arrives and pays?  That said.  The food was REALLY good.   I just can't deal with bad service.",

Ribs, pulled pork sandwich, Cole slaw, and fries were great. That was the good part.  The bad: employees did not want to be there and it was reflected in their customer service. This place is living off its past. No toilet paper in the restroom, watered way down iced tea, soda machine with 4 choices with at least 2 of them not adjusted properly. They forgot my Mac and Cheese that I ordered and paid for. Had to remind them after we got the food. Told the counter person that a car in the parking lot had its trunk open, counter person could care less. Only 2 tables of people in the place to ask about trunk, but he didn't bother.  Will never go to this location again. Will try the Van Buren location next time in town and that will determine if I wipe Honey Bears off my must eat locations when visiting Phoenix.",

The pulled pork was average and the collard greens were good, but for 20.28 for one meal, that's just wrong.

The insides were good, but nothing to write home about. The sides were ok, but not a single person finished, so that wasn't a ringing endorsement to me.  The thing that really soured me was that unless we ate outside, our party of more than 4 couldn't fit in any of the tables. In many places, eating outside wouldn't matter, but this in Phoenix and it was hot that day.   I probably won't go back but if a group of people wanted to go there, it would be fine.

(What I really wanted to do was to head over to Rose and Crown to meet with new acquaintances, but I didn't want to worry about parking...)  On the way, I spotted HBB on the left, but I kept going north for Fez.  However, it seemed like I'd never get there, so I gave myself a stopping point- if I hadn't reached Fez by the next light, I was going to turn around and interrogate the poor soul that happens to greet me at Honey Bear's.    The poor soul's name was Rich, who informed me that HBB only has one sauce, and unfortunate for me, it contains *.  (I received the same response at the Glendale Chocolate Affaire, but I assumed the \"one sauce only\" was for convenience purposes.  See?  Never assume.)  He sold me on the fact that they marinate the meats in a spice and vinegar-based marinade.  Alright, I'll try a 1/2 pound (about $8 w/ tax) of pork (his fave) and beef (which the young man, who patiently waited behind me while I asked poor Rich so many questions, ordered after I stepped aside and considered my options).  No, wait, I'll have a full pound (about $15 w/ tax), and could you add chicken, too?  And bbq sauce on the side, please.   While I waited for my take-out order, I asked Rich if I could sample the sweet potato pie, and to my surprise, he handed me a slice, told me to grab a spoon, and help myself!  It took only one teaspoonful of that slice for me to decide on purchasing a whole pie ($12) to go.    So how did the meats taste w/o the bbq sauce?  The chicken was very bland and pretty dry.  The beef was not much better, but at least it had some mouth-feel.  The pork was the clear winner, esp. since its marinade had the added benefit of red pepper flakes.  Would I go back for more meat?  Unless HBB designs a non-* based-sauce, no.  Well, maybe for the pork.  And only if I was carrying a bottle of bbq sauce in my purse.  1 star each for the pulled pork, sweet potato pie, and for Rich being such a sport.  (Kudos for letting me sample the pie!  Letting people sample is always good for business!).    p.s.  If HB had a shack that only sold sweet potato pie, I'd give it 5 stars! p.p.s.  Honey Bear BBQ, please add candied yams/sweet potatoes to your menu!  While you're at it, add some sweet potato fries, as well!  Allergy update: I concluded that the sweet potato pie must contain * ingredients bec. I went through two days of horrible allergy symptoms.  I won't be able to enjoy it anymore, but for those w/out allergies, do give it a try!",

    "text": "Never heard anything bad about this place so I came to try it out now that I work in the area. Ordered the #1 combo pulled pork with a side of Mac and cheese for $11 and change. I've gotten in the habit of tasting my food before adding anything on to it, that was a mistake! Meat is bland and tasted completely unseasoned, it was actually watery like it was boiled not slow cooked and pulled. Thank God we ate there cuz the bbq sauce is for dine in only and I was able to douse the meat in sauce. Mac and cheese was good but the sandwich was so off-putting I couldn't finish it. Also, I'm not sure if the a/c was broken but I'm fairly certain it was cooler outside than in, and it's the middle of July in Arizona! I give 2 stars for the mac and quick service.  I won't be coming here again, maybe I'll try Philly's next door.",

    "text": "I have avoided this place for so long because SO many people have told me this place sucks for BBQ...but guess what?! THEY WERE WRONG.  I got the spare ribs meal with mac and cheese, and a side of corn bread. While they did forget to give me my $1.50 cornbread and I checked my order before leaving thinking the bread in the aluminum foil was corn bread but it was more like a King's Hawaiian roll, I did enjoy my meal!  The mac and cheese was creamy and in a large portion. The spare ribs were cooked thoroughly and soft so the meat came right off the bone. The BBQ sauce could have been thicker and perhaps spicier, but overall I still loved the taste of the sauce. The service was great, quick, and they were very kind.  Overall, I'd definitely eat here again and I don't know why people keep saying this place is that bad. It's a lot better than other places I have tried to find BBQ at in Phoenix.",

    "text": "I visited here for lunch once last year, and the meal was fine. Since it's close to my firm's Phoenix office, and I was in the mood for BBQ, I figured I'd try it again. Big mistake.   First off, even though I arrived exactly at noon, they were already sold out of a number of sides, including corn bread. Moreover, they served me the very last serving of brisket. At noon!  The meat itself smelled horrible. Literally a faint odor of dog food. The sauce was quite good, and masked the scent somewhat, but I ended up throwing most of the meat out. I seriously wish that I'd thrown it all out, as the scent and taste lingered for hours. The coleslaw was prepackaged in the fridge, and tasted like it. The beans were actually quite good (earning a second star begrudgingly).   The service was, umm, strange. Not friendly or unfriendly. Just uncomfortable. And I needed to wait about 10 minutes for my food, even though the place was almost empty. Did I mention it was noon?  Never again.",

I was extremely under-impressed with the customer service skills of the lady at the register. She was short, and it was evident she was irritated when I paused to order a side. I didn't get my drink cup and had to go back to the counter and ask for it. She very impatiently and rudely (with an almost accusatory tone) asked me if I paid for a meal. Not how I wanted to be treated.   When I got to the table to eat, my side wasn't in the bag, and my experience with the cashier was bad enough that I didn't bother going back again for fear of receiving her accusatory tone like with my drink cup.   Needless to say, while I thoroughly enjoyed my pork sandwich, I will not be going back to this establishment. It was evident they were either short staffed, or someone forgot to order supplies, because they were out of different meats and sides. While I can understand these situations may be frustrating, it's not the customer's fault and they shouldn't have to deal with it in sub-par customer service.",

When it finally came, it was just plain bad. The ribs were super tough and chewy. The mac and cheese was mushy, the collard greens were decent. They were the only thing I liked. Even the sweet potato pie was disappointing. Watery texture with a pumpkin pie spice flavor.   But the biggest disappointment was the BBQ. There was zero smoke flavor. I threw half of my food out. When I walked out to the parking lot, I noticed they had two grills set up. I don't even think they were serving real BBQ. I think it was cooked on propane. All of the staff had Spanish accents. I think it may have changed ownership. I'm never going back. It was probably the worst BBQ I've had in Phoenix. Oh, and the bathrooms had no soap or paper towels. Gross.",

My boyfriend was sitting at our table so the employee couldn't see from behind the counter. He seemed irritated with the fact & then walked around to take a closer look.

The bottom bun was practically liquid. Really unpleasant. My husband didn't want to eat his pork. I told him to just pour the sauce on it and he said the sauce wasn't any good. I have to agree. Back in the day, HBs had the BEST bbq sauce. Now, not so much. So disappointing (and expensive).",

Several years after I moved out of the area, I returned and noticed a difference.  That was 20 years ago.  Well, I thought I'd check out their Central Ave location.  Walking in, we smelled methane gas from dried out floor drain traps.  I ordered the wings and had to take them back after two bites.  They were rubbery & flavorless, plus's, the check skin was silvery white which indicates that they were old & probably covered with slime when placed in the deep fryer.  The catfish looked weird but tasted okay.  The serving of Cole slaw looked liked it had been prepacked and was drowning in mayonnaise.  We thought it looked old because it was so smashed down, but, their quantity was plentiful.  The cowboy beans had good taste, but, were nothing like the ones they used to serve which contained plenty of green peppers and hot link slices.  Now, very few green peppers, no onions, and they used hot dog Weiners sparingly.  I asked to replace my wings with a pulled pork sandwich.  Has & Dickey's beat Honey Bear's hands down.  It had a cheap bun which was soggy and smashed down.  They don't even have Coke nor Pepsi products.  The restaurant business is a tough business, so that would explain their reduced quality.  The server/cashier was the best thing about this place.  He was GREAT!",

It wasn't that it was \"bad,\" it's just that, as far as the nationwide spectrum of barbecue goes, this is just not that good. But, for whatever reason, Arizona is just a tough place in which to get good barbecue. It's a busy corner, now (wasn't when I was there) right in front of the light rail in a decidedly office area. So, the lunch crowd is heavy. The place looks like it used to be a taco, cheesesteak or other fast food joint and had minimal renovations done. It's small and gets pretty crowded. I got a brisket sandwich, which is sort of my own litmus test when it comes to BBQ. Prices were about what I would expect to pay. IIRC, my sandwich was about $6-7. Sides were extra. The sandwich was okay. The brisket had a nice flavor, but wasn't fabulous, and I didn't think a whole lot of the sauce which, to me, is really the best part of good barbecue (although I know it's not pure barbecue). But, regardless, this is still the best BBQ I've found in Phoenix. There used to be a place in Tempe called Big City, which was just fabulous. But they moved out to Mesa and went out of business near the beginning of the year. So we're left with a bit of a void and, now, you can find better BBQ at random festivals from booths, and even here in Tucson. But, if I'm really craving a great brisket or a spectacular slab or ribs or a plump, perfect sausage, I have to head east to Texas. There's just no comparison.",

    "text": "Having spent a lot of time in Texas and Oklahoma, I've eaten a lot of BBQ.  But I'll review Honey Bear's on its own merits (or lack).  I've been eating at HB for 20 years, the location on Van Buren mostly.  This location isn't so great.    Pros:  It's fast, the meat is tasty, the sauce is good too, a bit on the thin side, sweet/sour and spicy.  Cobbler is good.  Cons:  It's really expensive, service is almost menacing in its unfriendliness, place is sticky/dirty, sides are hit-or-miss, mostly miss.  Tasty smoky meat.  You'll pay dearly for it, $5 for a small sandwich, more for a large, sides are extra.  One time with a bud we figured that HB charges about $25-$30/lb for their meat as ordered in the restaurant.  Ribs and other whole pieces of meat put you easily in the $15+ range.  Corn is mushy, beans are tasty, potato salad is subjected to strange spice-abuse by a cook who doesn't understand what potato salad is.    Drinks are fountain and iced tea.  You can't get a small cup of sauce to go, even with the leftovers from your $20 rib dinner - you have to pay and pay.  This sort of stinginess doesn't sit well with me.    The place is dirty, with sticky tables and chairs.  Overall appearance is dingy.  Service is always unsmiling, unhelpful, all business.  They don't make you feel like coming back.  I don't go back now unless I'm forced to by downtown coworkers.",

You can't go wrong with a BBQ sandwich here.  There fries here are good and potato-ey - and their potato salad comes with a nice mayo whip celery and big chunks or potato.  Nice!   Don't expect much here in terms of decor - with the counter service and former Taco Bell digs.",

The meat is always lean and usually juicy.  The sauce is as good as any, if you like BBQ sauce with a little kick.  Everyone hating because this isn't like a BBQ place back in (insert famous BBQ town here) is just funny to me.  \"It's not real BBQ unless (327-point checklist of real BBQ)...\"  Whatever.  I love this place.",

    "text": "I just went here for dinner with my gf and a friend using a couple of Groupons we had. I've also had it recommended to me by a few people previously.   Location: It's like any other place on Central- the location itself isn't that sketchy but everything around it is. The inside is a pretty standard Mom-and-Pop simple decor. Dining area was pretty clean and employees were walking around regularly to make sure it stayed that way. Trashcans had those annoying small-circle opening tops on them and made discarding your refuse without getting crud from previously discarded trash on your hands a task. Men's bathroom was cramped but clean.   Food: I had the brisket, pulled pork, and Cowbro' beans. Brisket was alright; I've had better and I've had worse. It could've used a bit more smoking/more intense smoking but the sauce complemented it well. Pulled pork was good- about on par with any other decent pulled pork. It had a nice balance of flavor between the meat and smoke and was also complemented well by the sauce. The sauce is a low-viscosity variety with a great balance of sweet and spicy. The sweetness was just enough to draw out some extra meaty flavors in the brisket and pork without overpowering it. The spiciness was just enough to complement the other flavors, keep the taste-buds excited, but not too spicy by any means. The Cowbro' beans were actually pretty amazing. They seemed like a standard canned-base with other seasonings added, which made them taste infinitely better than canned. The beans also had chunks of smoked sausage in them, which I felt was a nice touch. The sausage had good flavor and a crisp casing.   My girlfriend had a pulled pork sandwich, ribs, and mac n' cheese. She thought the ribs were \"alright,\" a fairly standard rib. She enjoyed the mac n' cheese and was too full to touch the sandwich so it came home with us.   My friend had the chicken sandwich, mac n' cheese, and peach cobbler. She thought the chicken sandwich tasted good but was a little dry (and it did look a bit dry from across the table). She thought the mac n' cheese was alright but that she'd had much better. She enjoyed the cobbler but felt the filling was oddly watery and regretted not ordering it a la mode.   Staff: Friendly, attentive.   Summary: If I'm in the mood for barbecue, it will certainly be on my list of places to go to if I happen to be in the mood to drive to Central.",

    "text": "Went here yesterday.  Ordered the pulled pork sandwich, side of beans and drink for me to eat there. Beans had chunks of what tasted like dehydrated dried onion in them and they were not hydrated. Sandwich bun was totally soggy and pork was dry. Ordered the 1/4 chicken meal with dark meat (does not like breast meat)  and drink for my husband to take with him because he wasn't hungry.  We sat down with my meal and ate, he had not gotten his meal yet.  About 20-25 min later, went to counter to get his meal and they didn't even have it ready!  Then they said, oh, is the white meat ok?  We don't have any of the dark meat ready right now?  After 25 minutes and they didn't have any ready? Husband reluctantly said ok.  Got home and later ate it and it was all dried out and appeared old.  We will not be going back, the customer service is terrible and so is their food these days. Spent $20.00 on a small amount and food and this is what we got.

    "text": "We drove to the LoLo's downtown location from basically the 51 and Shea to find that it closed at 7. From there, we drove up Grand to Town Talk II, which sadly, also closed at 7. We had a chat with the owner who told us that the closest place for barbecue was Honey Bear's, even though he said that he didn't want to see us leave. It was about a 5 minute drive from there. Once we arrived, we ordered. I got the ribs and two nasty side items that came with it. The fountain drink machine didn't have Coke or Pepsi products, but had R-C Cola products. The selection was interesting, but I found it unique and somewhat cool. Anyway, my plate had six or seven ribs drenched in a too-sweet barbecue sauce. The ribs had almost no meat on them. I don't know, maybe I asked for the wrong food or something, but I was highly disappointed in Honey Bear's. I do admit, however, that the televisions showing the NBA Finals did help a bit. I don't think I'll come back. I've also learned a valuable lesson: for the most part, restaurants in Downtown Phoenix close at 7.",

But the meat suffers from not \"marinating\" in said sauce. Slaw was passable but the potato salad had that weird store bought, vinegary, mustardy, icky poo cocka flavor. Ya'll know what I mean!

The 7 year old chose the chicken so I got the pork.  While I usually prefer the pork, my daughter and I sampled each other's sandwiches and, wow, that chicken was delicious!  The cole slaw had a spice in it that she didn't like (celery salt?) but she loved the mac and cheese.   I did like the cole slaw though.  Weird side note - I had mango for desert a bit later and it rounded out the spicy sauce and heavy pork meal really well.  Maybe I'll try mango with the meal next time....",

Thought the meal was on the below average scale for tastiness...the beef sandwich meat suffered from not being marinated, and it was bone dry...the bbq rib was more of the same...so this would have been a 2 star review...BUT what pushed it down to 1 star for me was that my ribs were \"bloody\"...No not pink, but actually bloody with the jelly-like texture of raw meat...great when I'm eating sushi, but not so much for bbq pork  I actually returned the bloody thing to the counter person who agreed that it was bloody and made me a new plate...unfortunately, it was a new plate of the same bloody ribs, I gave up and just trashed the bloody plate....so no, I won't be back for another try  If you're looking for tasty bbq sandwich...try TEXAZ for lunch...that's where I'd be the next time I have a craving",

I recommend this if your in the mood for BBQ. I'm still dying to try their ribs but I don't think I could eat that much for lunch. The one thing I don't care for is their soda product. They have RC Cola! This is the only place I know that does'nt have coke or pepsi,, so I guess they are behind the times in the beverage department. But if your looking for good BBQ you should definetly try this place. Just make sure you grab some napkins!!",

Amazing what can happen to a once great place in just a couple of years. Ordered a pound of brisket and a pound of pork. Sides were cowboy beans and cole slaw. Arrived to pick up my order only to be told no brisket or cowboy beans. Staff was about as apathetic as a funeral home. Too bad for you. Bye, bye. No offer to substitute, no suggestions of any kind. I am only glad I decided to pay by cash so they didn't get my credit card number. Left empty handed and went to Waldo's up on 7th Street instead. Customer BEWARE.",

I liked it, but I liked the sides better than the BBQ itself.    I ordered the sandwich plus two ribs, a drink and a side for $14.49.  My sandwich was the pulled pork which was good but a bit dry.  A little extra BBQ sauce came in handy, although the sauce was - per my own personal preferences - a little too sweet, in need of some heat and a bit too orange in color.  The ribs were killer.  My side was cole slaw, which surprised my brother-in-law.  With all the great other choices, why would you order cole slaw, he wondered?  Because I love it , and the Honey Bear's slaw was great.  Fresh and delish.  I also \"borrowed\" his mac & cheese and his Cowbro Beans.  He thought the mac & cheese was rich - I slurped it up and practically licked the cup clean.  Fantastic.  Beans were ok but too meat-filled for my taste.  Was bummed they were out of corn on the cob but I loved the sides we had.  Special thanks to the brother-in-law for the introduction.  I love cool local places like Honey Bear's BBQ!  I'd go back.",

As far as basic BBQ menu options go, Honey Bear's is where it is at in Phoenix. I love their pulled pork sandwich and their sauce is fantastic. They have a great variety of sides to go along with it as well. I found their ribs meat to be delicious, however, it was pretty fatty at some parts. I have definitely had better elsewhere in the country.  Honey Bear's would be a four star restaurant with a few steps in the right direction towards improving costumer service and the costumer's dining experience. First, get wait staff the goes around and ask costumers about how they are enjoying their meal and if they could get them anything else to make their meal more enjoyable. Then, remove the ads from the table and reinvest profits into the business.  Pro-tip: Watch where you park so your car does not get towed. And be sure to check in on yelp to redeem your offer.",

    "text": "We've been coming here for maybe a dozen years, and we've had really good barbecue here, and the service has always been polite. I think their sauce is too thin and watery for my taste, but their ribs have always been very tender. We went in last night for dinner and to pick up a bottle of sauce to mail to relatives across country. The dinners no longer come with a roll, and I had just a few bites of the peach cobbler before throwing it away. It's always been a cooked cobbler with a little cinnamon, but now it's cold, uncooked canned peaches, no spice, mixed with a gummy pastry shell.  The ribs were still as tender as ever. The main reason for my one star review is that when we went to buy a bottle of sauce, we didn't see any for sale. My husband asked if it was being sold in a store and the guy said A.J.'s had it but that he had a bottle to sell us. He charged us first, $6.99 plus tax, then said that he had hidden a stash of sauce in the back so his fellow employees wouldn't find it. We didn't know what that meant, but we waited while the guy was in the back for a few minutes. When he came out he handed my husband a bottle and we went out to the car, where I looked at it. It was unlabeled, unsealed and warm. Very warm. And sticky. I took it back in and said, \"You just filled this, right?\" He agreed. So I told him that we were sending it across country and that it might not be opened for weeks. I asked him if it was vacuum sealed (because of spillage and the fact that it was so warm and could breed bacteria). He smiled at me and said that yes, he had vacuum sealed it.  Because I didn't want to send an unlabeled mystery bottle, we drove right over to A.J.'s and found Honey Bear's sauce on the shelf- same size, for $3.99. So why the price difference? When we got home we unscrewed the top on the bottle from the restaurant and of course, it was not vacuum sealed, he had lied. And he'd been so reluctant to have a couple of bucks walk out the door that he was willing to potentially get people sick.",

Well he ordered a pulled pork sandwich which he loved and inhaled,  I ordered the sliders thinking they are small little sandwiches, I was so wrong these so called sliders were huge! I'm not complaining I was just shocked at how big and filled with meat they were! I was only able to finish one, the Pulled pork was really good. The sauce it self was a lil too tangy to my liking.

Good flavor, nicely smoked. But there was something off about the sauce they put on the meat. It had a =very= sharp vinegar taste. Now, I know that a tangy flavor is characteristic of the \"Tennessee\" style BBQ. It's what distinguishes it from Chicago, Texas or Kansas City BBQ which is generally thicker and sweeter. But this was like they put in twice the vinegar this time.  I know it wasn't my taste buds or something because the sauce in the pot for dine-in people to get extra tasted normal.  Then, the Cowbro' beans. They are perhaps my favorite thing about Honey Bear's. But they were also different. It tasted like one of the ingredients was spaghetti sauce. To be fair, I actually liked it. But it =was= different.  I hope my experience was a one-off. Otherwise, they've lost the handle on quality control.",

Also, It doesn't look like they can seat large parties together...most of the tables only seat 4 people.  Overall, the meats are excellent.

I got there at a good time, because a line formed after I got my food. I enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich, and the mac 'n' cheese was creamy with just a touch of pepper that added a bit of zap. The sauce on the sandwich was good as well.   I wish they had a pulled BBQ plate option with a couple of sides, but I didn't see that (unless I missed it). The sandwich was good, though -- I'll be back!",

Cowbro beans, pulled pork, chicken, slaw, hot links, potato salad, mac n cheese, rib tips, and other items.  The cowbro beans are most peoples favorites.  I think the meat is always a bit dry and have to drown it with their sauce.  The sauce is alright.  A little too sweet for my taste.  I like a bit more chile flavor and heat.  The links are pretty tasty.  The mac n cheese is also above average.  The rest is just okay for me.    It is really hard to find good bbq in AZ.  Crazy as that sounds with all these tranplants out here from all over the country.  You'd think one of them would know how to make some excellent bbq...",

Maybe I've flown too high. Real BBQ for me was from an old man everyone called \"Knuckles\" on the side of the road in South Carolina sitting in a lawn chair next to a smoker painted like a pig.   I ordered the 1/2 lb. barbecue pork with two sides. I tried the mac and cheese as well as the cole slaw.   The pork was tough and had no smoke flavor whatsoever. The mac and cheese was watery, to the point where I wanted to ask if they poured in water recently. The cole slaw was ok, just bland. The sauce was alright.  I ordered a sweet tea because, come on, this is a barbecue place. The cashier told me they had RC products. No sweet tea? Get out of here.  Rivers Cuomo the cashier overcharged me for almost twice my meal. I just left and didn't go back. It wasn't even worth getting my money back.",

    "text": "This was my first time to this place and probably the last! When you walk in to any service business you expect a certain amount of kindness and professionalism. Well not here. we were met with a rude cashier who kept screaming NEXT as if there was no one in line. Next I saw all these signs telling you what you can't do in this place like do not dump anything in the soda dispenser drain and check your order before you leave and so on. Finally when we were able to place a order the extremely rude cashier seemed so irritated that we actually had the nerve to enter this place that she had no desire to even take our order or answer any questions that we had. The price was decent but on the expensive side, 20 dollars for 2 people without drinks. So we finally get our order and knowing that i have to check my bag because i read the sign that had it printed in BOLD letters, I noticed that I was missing my potato salad. So the rude cashier looks over and says WHAT. And I said I'm missing my potato salad so she opens the cooler and basically throws it at me with very good accuracy as if she has done this many times. So then my brother asked her if she missed his potato salad also and she screams out I DON'T KNOW CHECK YOUR BAG, As if she has somehow forgotten what she put in there 30 seconds ago.   Bottom line food is good but it's not worth the effort you have to go through to get it. The staff is so bad that I will go out of my way to go somewhere else. The owners should be aware that the service of this place has gotten to the point that people won't even go there so they don't have to deal with the worst service they have ever had. In todays economy where people are choosing carefully where to spend their money you need to have something special and this place should put up a big sign that says:  GO AWAY WE DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY!!!!!  They will never get anymore of mine.",

    "text": "We were starving and headed downtown for a concert and decided that BBQ ribs sounded great. I remembered that I had a an old groupon that I had bought so we decided to try it. When we first walked in it did seem a little ghetto but I know sometimes smaller places are better. We ordered a full slab Of pork ribs and 2 drinks. It came with 2 sides an with tax was about $30. My groupon was for $20 but was expired so I thought I would only get the amount I paid, $10. The only positive thing about our experience was that they honored my groupon for the full $20.  The cashier was not polite at all, not wanting to even take my groupon at first. You could tell he didn't want to be working.  Another employee was sitting in plain sight eating a large plate with no manners and looking gross. I went to get some lemonade and it tasted like water so I dumped it out and got root beer. About 10 min after we sat down they called our number but only to say that they were out of ribs! The place had 2 customers on a Friday night and the special was rib tips..but they only had chicken! They offered an extra side but no change in the price... Then while we were eating I heard another customer who had come in long after us, being old that they were out of ribs and the customer was upset that he had already paid for ribs too! I don't understand why they were letting people order and pay for ribs when it was clear they knew that they knew they didn't have any!   When we got our meal my husband took one bite and said he hated it. the chicken was dry, bbq sauce tasted like metal and the red potato salad seemed like the kind you get in bulk at a grocery store. The fries   Were ok so thats all he ate. I liked the bbq sauce but the chicken was super dry. our friend ordered a chicken sandwich an the bun fell apart as she picked it up. She took one bite and said it was gross and didn't eat any more of it.   If we had to pay full price I would have made a big scene but because it was a groupon and were just trying a new place I let it go but we will never go again.",

Trekking down to Van Buren was the same adventure that being surrounded by barbed wire at Little Miss is today. This was my first ever visit to your Central Avenue location. The BBQ was as good as I remember. We ordered your pulled pork and your chicken. Both were great. We also enjoyed having our pups with us on your front patio. Thank you.  So what's the deal with all the mediocre Yelp reviews? Is it Yelp herd behavior, not wanting to give a great review unless others feel the same? Has there been an actual deterioration in quality and service? Are people really not getting the idea that BBQ sauces vary regionally? Is it a problem that Honey Bear's Mac and Cheese was developed before White Truffle Mac and Cheese became a foodie staple? Can't tell you. Our experience was great. Perhaps the herd instinct even had an impact on me, however, as I settled on a four star rating after considering five.  Yes, there is only one BBQ sauce. Yes, the decor is basic. Yes, the counter staff is not overly loquacious. Yes, the outdoor seating is right next to Central Avenue.  I'm just not sure how much any of this matters if you're looking for a BBQ joint. My taste buds still steer me toward Little Miss, but Honey Bear's is a very solid alternative. And one without an hour long wait! I'll be back!",

I was so stoked to find a good BBQ restaurant in the central area.   This place is garbage. Paid $7.05 for a 0.90 cent size cheeseburger from McDonalds. There was hardly anything to the sandwich, could compare it to the amount of meat on an Arby's jr. I tried a pulled pork sandwich. The meat was lacking the True smoked BBQ flavor that I'd assume it's supposed to have. The meat was bland, tasteless. The bread was a cheap bun that you can get a 6 pack for $1 at the grocery store. I'm not a big guy and the sandwich was gone in 5 bites. Not filling at all.   The inside is old, bathrooms look like they haven't been cleaned in months, dining area seems clean but needs to be updated. Tacky tables with bus stop ads in them.  Tiny, tiny sandwich. Bland food. BBQ sauce is nothing to write home about. I'm extremely disappointed that I wasted my money here. Not a fan.",

    "text": "I do not know why this place is getting such low stars, I feel there may be people who are having biases towards the owner. I have never been really a \"barbeque\" man and was in the area for business reasons so I decided to stop by and grab something to eat because the smell was very good, I am really glad I did because it went very above expectations! I ordered the pulled pork sandwhich combonotion and you get the sandwhich and macoroni with good barbeque sauce, the sandwhich was very good but my only complaint was the bread was very weak and it made the sandwhich messy to eat. The mac and cheese was average nothing special but because I did not realize I walked in closing time 8 pm the management was nice enough to give me free chili pork bowl! They were very kind and courteous and attended and answered any questions I had. Next time I am in the area I will stop by again!  Good food, nice people, good barbeque sauce, good establishment all around",

Really slow and it did not seem to be because they were busy. There were very few patrons. As I waited I could overhear others asking for the brisket and being told the sad news. The bad part was the employee watched them stare at the menu for many minutes without giving them the heads-up that they were out of brisket so back to the menu they went. Pork was okay but not worth going back for. Seems like a place that is a bit past it's heyday.",

I recently began working half a block away and stopped in for lunch. I ordered a brisket sandwich with collard greens and BBQ beans as sides. Strangely though they had just opened for the day, they had no greens so I went with slaw. My order was takeout, I think around $13. My bag was heavy. I was hungry and excited...that is until I opened my sandwich. I expected some nice fresh brisket, juicy and hearty. What I had was a tiny hamburger roll with really dry chunks of slightly smoky meat. It was very unenjoyable. I realized of course that the weight was due to my two sides, which were good. I won't be returning for lunch, for sauce maybe. I make a better brisket",

And on top of that, I'm pretty sure the coleslaw was spoiled and made me sick. I should have asked for a refund the moment I saw the food in the tray but I decided to give them a chance.

I am shocked at some of the statement some people post on Yelp. It sounds like some bitter competitors or someone with a grudge. These attacks are blatantly False. Just one example: to the \"customer\" who claimed that the BBQ didn't have enough sauce - if you had actually been in the restaurant you would know that they have large containers of their sauce so that you can get as much as you want.   The food is great, the staff is friendly, the owners are great.  Go Honey Bears!",

There's a reason why this place has 3 stars. If I could give it 0 stars I would.   I work very close by and this has been one of my favorite places to eat during my lunch. I ordered 2 pork sandwiches a drink and fries.  When my co -worker and I opened our bbq pork sandwiches , it had a very odd smell. Pork goes bad pretty quickly if not stored correctly.  This has never been the case before, so I went up to the cashier (Bruce) and told him the sandwiches did not smell okay. I asked if maybe he could smell them and let me know what he thought.  He was very rude and said \"he was not going to\" ...said if I wanted something else or my money back. He never apologized , or even attempted to figure out by going to the kitchen to find out if the rest of the meat had gone bad. Since he did not want to help or care that I told him something was off with the meat, I asked for my money back.   He made me wait there, until he had helped every last person that kept coming through the door.   I wanted to let you know this, because if someone complains about food that has gone bad, the least an employee should do is try to determine whether or not this is True. Many people can get very ill, by eating spoiled pork.   This isn't my first time coming here for me or my co-workers and , the meat has never smelled spoiled before.   I was very disappointed in the way I was treated by your employee , in front of others and I am reaching out to you so this doesn't happen again to another one of your loyal customers.",

So that's exactly what I got but with coleslaw and a pickle came with it too. It looks southern on the inside and looks very quaint on the outside. But I'm glad I saw it because I almost went to a sandwich place that was next to it until my mom told me there was a BBQ place. I was very pleased. It smelled lovely when we were there. I can't wait to go back and again and eat there. I will definitely be coming back. So if you like BBQ, try this place!",

We usually pay cash and I've never had any other restaurants require this. I agreed to give a credit card over the phone but the phone number she gave went straight to voicemail every time I tried to call. To make a long story short, I was never able to place the order ahead of time. SO I called the store directly and they put the order together quickly and without advance payment. The man at the store even brought the food out and loaded it in our car. The food was good. I will never use them again for a bulk order though. Too much headache! I shouldn't have to work so hard to give them business.",

It looks like they are purposely trying to bring down the property value of the whole block! The place has paint cracking, tables and chairs that shake and move when you use them, and there is an overall ambiance of despair and hopelessness when you are near the building. The owner truly should commit himself to a mental institution. While he is making a great return on his investment, the owner apparently has a business strategy that is focused on keeping the building looking like a piece of crap while he pockets the money that needs to be re-invested in the building. He doesn't give a damn about the surrounding businesses, the city of Phoenix, or his customers. None of my coworkers will eat at this establishment because of the appearance of the place. We work literally across the street.   Message to owner: Way to think about yourself instead of your community by pocketing all the money that should go towards making your POS BBQ shack look like a place a non-hobo would frequent.   On a separate note: The food is great! 9/10 for everything on the menu. Delicious!",

They say your first instincts are best; we first went into the Philly sub place next door that had Coke products and walked out.

Listen Downtown!  you   want me  to bring my family and friends down on the weekend,you want us to explore downtown and use the metro rail,   we need some family friendly , hopefully locally owned,  places to eat !  So 1 big ole star for that!  Now for the rest ...Honey Bears has that  hole in the wall , down south feel to me , and that alone will probably bring me back at sometime .  Especially if I have kids with me otherwise it's Switch, Matt's or Fez.   Okay and now for the hits:  This is a  good  place for pulled pork or BBQ chicken sandwich ...don't stray from that and you will be happy , husband and kiddos gave a big two thumbs up for that... lil mini me had a 1/2 chicken dinner  w/o  BBQ sauce ( weirdo)  and pronounced it good.  Mine were  ribs which were very small, not meaty and I had trouble with tang of the vinegar based sauce.(BTW hubby loved it ) Portions were big on everything but my ribs.  Faux Daughter number 2 couldn't finish her sandwich.   I could eat a big ole plate of the mac and cheese wow cheesey goodness... kids agreed. Fries were rumored to be good , one of my kids said  better than  in -n-out the others shot her a dirty look .. so you try them and see.  Loved the coleslaw and I wouldn't  share it with anyone .Corn was good but not memorable.   They have RC and Seven up products which goes to show it's old school I guess. If you can't abide by that bring your own I guess.   Service was great, the dude taking our order was personable, helpful and patient with our big order. They also redid mini me's order when it first came with BBQ sauce.   Place is nicer than Stacey's for ambiance but I don't really look for that with BBQ , do you?",

Decent sandwiches (chicken, brisket, etc.) and BBQ sauce - but I was thinking this was going to knock me backwards with how good it was where in reality it was just, \"Well, I'd definitely eat here again, but ain't rushing to do it.\" The patronage can be, uh, \"colorful\" and \"interesting\" at times, especially the later at night you go (not that I have anything against people talking to themselves).  But I do appreciate that it's still there, a stalwart against all the crazy development happening around it.

As a Southerner, I wish to bring a class action suit aginst this place for claiming to \"put some South in your mouth\" on the sign out front.  The ribs were dry, flavorless and covered in some type of runny sauce that was essentially a watered down ketchup.  The Mac and Cheese side was basically Kraft from a box.  The cole slaw had a nice black pepper flavor and I actually liked that.  The place is a dive, service rude and the bathroom filthy.  To top it all off, I went here with a Yelp check in offer of $2 off if you spend $10.  well, the cashier had never heard of Yelp before and had to go talk to someone for quite some time (holding up the line) before granting the discount.  Then, the cash register only gave a $1 discount.  To make matters even more aggrevating, the recepit claimed I got the $2 Tuesday discount but clearly only took $1 off the bill.  So, in addition to being unable to serve good food or clean the establishment, they stink at math too.   I've been in Phoenix only one day on a business trip, but surely there is at least some type of \"real\" BBQ in the town.  Guess I'll stick to Mexican food this trip. Trust me...if you have even like BBQ a little bit, stay away from this place.  Your taste buds and self esteem will thank you.",

First of all, I have to admit, I worked for Famous Dave's years ago and although I couldn't stand being employed there, they had some darn good barbecue and I'd still go eat there if there was one closer by. So maybe my expectations were too high for Honey Bears, but they fell way short.   I got the pork brisket sandwich. I couldn't even pick it up, the bun was so soggy. Like snot. I tried to pick it up and it just disintegrated and all the meat fell out. I ate it with a fork, seeing as I was too starving to send it back. The meat was very moist and tender until I got a huge bite of the nastiest, driest chunk of meat. Like hard and chewy beef jerky. I have never discourteously spit food out of my mouth before, but that was too unpleasant to swallow!   Moving on, the fries were good. The beans were awesome! The bbq sauce was lacking in consistency and flavor. The cheese in the mac was a bit thin. The ribs I had that came with their combo 3, well one was alright, the other one was almost all fat.   All in all, I didn't \"hate\" it but I'm not going back. There are better places to spend my money.",

I've tried both the pork and beef BBQ sandwhiches; they're both REALLY bland without the sauce. I eat a lot and I just like how they have large portions.  Some people might be turned off by the cleanliness of the restaurant, which can be best described as dingy.",

    "text": "Somewhere, beneath layers of flacid, white skin, I am a black man.   Though I cannot readily identify with years of oppression, white women crossing the street when I pass for no good reason and the spectre of slavery, I think that my love of motown, broad-hipped women and soul food makes me, at the least, an honorary brother.     Strangely, and perhaps because of hunger, the best BBQ pork sandwich I ever had was dolled out to me as I hurriedly boarded a plane in Nasville, TN.   I've dined all across America and even in Memphis itself and I've tasted some fine BBQ and contrary to other reviewers here, I thought HB BBQ was a-ok.     I was feeling depressed last night, the unfortunate consequence of some protracted litigation I'm involved in and I got a hankering for slow-cooked meat slathered in tangy bbq sauce and my craving guided the wheel as I drove to HB's.      It still looks like an IHOP.  They've changed the booths and moved some things around, but the decor has a definite \"International House of Barbeque\" feel to it.   I must also admit that I was more than a little dismayed when 3 hispanic guys made my bbq pork sandwich.  What in all the red tamales do hispanic folks know about BBQ?  Call me picky, but when I get something called Honey Bear BBQ with a song of the south lookin bear on the sign, I expect a large black man or woman with a disarming smile to sling my pork and slaw together on a paper plate--the way god intended.   Perhaps I'm missing out on all the great latin BBQ, but I've long believed that after all the suffering God forced upon my brothers, he tried to make penance by imbuing them with rhythm, soul and bbq knowledge.  Nonetheless, the sandwich was tasty.  I would have liked a spicy sauce option, but I'll take what I can get.  It's not deep south bbq and it's probably not even like Mom's, even if your mom was irish and grew up in poughkipsie, but it's at least pretty tasty and reasonably priced.  It's Phoenixand 50 degrees in the dead of winter.  We take what we can get.",

The second time I had HB's was a work lunch that we had this delivered. Once again, the pork was completely dry, but not as dry as the pulled chicken, which my coworkers complained about.

The pro e wad very reasonable. Lets start with the chicken.  It was smothered in bbq sauce, but was a nice piece of chicken.  The taste was OK.  I've had much better, also much worse.  It also wasn't that beefy of a chicken, so I was happy I  ordered the extra sandwich. The sandwich was a different story. I would give the bbq meat a 8/10. It had a very smokey taste, like it just came off a big pile of wood.  I thoughly enjoyed that meat, the plain white bun it was on, not so much.   The fries were very basic, and the potato salad was also nothing to write home about.  If I am back in town, I would probably come back.  But, again a very sub-par bbq experience.",

Well last night during a First Friday reconnaissance mission we chose to go for a late dinner.  Walking in is pretty much a time warp to the 70s/80s when things didn't need to be glitzy.  You walk up to the counter, order and you can get either a sandwich or by the pound.  We ordered Corn on the cobb, 1/2 lb of pork, and cowboy beans.  The order came up in five minutes and we sat down.  The Beans were spicy and perfect, pork and sauce solid.  Smart choice.",

Beyond the BBQ being spot on the sides always seem to be just as delicious. Coleslaw, Mac n Cheese, Potato Salad, Sweet Potato Fries, etc............  My only qualm as of recently is it seems they have changed the coleslaw a bit. They made the portion larger which is awesome!

Its kind of great though... you know exactly what you're getting... no need for 'atmosphere' or attentive customer service because the food speaks for itself.    My only gripe was that they don't have cornbread, which is disappointing at a BBQ place. Instead dinner comes with disappointing white bread rolls.  I wouldn't call the location particularly sketchy.  There is a big parking lot and its right on Central Ave near lots of nicer places too.",

    "text": "I have lived in Phoenix for 20 years, have always heard good things about Honey Bears, and have meant to try their Q for a long time.  Greatly, greatly, disappointed!  I went there on a Saturday a little over one month ago.  I ordered a slab of ribs, beans, slaw, and sweet potato pie to go [wanted peach cobbler, but they were out].  I was really looking forward to some good ribs.  I arrived to pick-up my order and there was a line of three parties ahead of me at the cash register.  No big deal until the sassy young lady at the register spent 15 minutes talking and checking out the first person in line.  While I stood getting frustrated from waiting so long to just pick up food, the second and third parties in front of me left because they too were tired of waiting.    When it was finally my turn, I mentioned to the young lady, \"do you realize that two parties in front of me walked out because they were tired of waiting\"?  When I said this, an older lady that appeared to be the manager stopped dead in her tracks as she was walking by.  She asked the young lady at the cash register what was going on.  The young lady stated that I told her two parties had just walked out because they were tired of waiting.  The manager said, \"oh\" and went on about her business like it was no big deal.  When I paid my bill, the young lady stated, \"your food is over there,\" pointing to the other end of the counter about 6 feet away.  I asked if there was extra sauce with my meal and she told me extra sauce is always included with ribs.    I get home with my order and am ready to chow down on some ribs and the first thing I notice is there is no extra sauce with my meal as I was told.  I opened up the plate of ribs and was quite surprised when I took a bite.  I think these ribs may have been walked past the smoker at some point, but that is about all.  No smokey flavor, no smokey color, just a big disappointment.  The beans were very good, the slaw appeared to be a premade product, and the potato pie was o.k.  However, I really wanted the cobbler they had on the menu but were out of.    I admit that I am a BBQ junkie and have high expectations of such food.  But I had heard such high reviews of Honey Bears and these ribs were so bad.  I honestly ate half of the slab and tossed the rest in the trash.  I paid ~$30 dollars for this single meal and was insulted by the treatment of their staff.  I will never walk through their door again...",

    "text": "I can't believe that there are ANY negative reviews of Honey Bear's!  I've been a customer for decades, having started when the owners and founders were smoking meat in a converted 50-gal. drum outside the original East Phoenix location.  I now frequent the Central Ave. location and the food is still as good as it's always been.    If all that matters to you is ambiance, this is probably not the place for you. Honey Bear's is all about the food.  Someone complained that the pork was too soggy.  Another that the pork was too dry.  HOW can it be both??  The pulled pork IS \"soggy\" because it's JUICY!  Honey Bear's pulled pork is to DIE for!  Someone actually dissed the barbecue sauce!  I've been hitting barbecue joints from the Mississippi to all points west, and HB's sauce is hands-down the best I've ever found.    The only complaint I have is that when I tried to order the baby back ribs (the best thing that has ever been in my mouth), I was told that they are no longer carrying them but are now offering spare ribs.  So, I tried the spare ribs and, while they are good, they just don't compare to the baby backs.  I had never tasted \"collard greens\", so I decided to try them.  Now I'm hooked.  Since I liked them so much at HB's, I ordered them when I went to Notorious P.I.G., another barbecue restaurant. I had to throw those away...they were loaded with vinegar.  I will continue to buy the mouth watering pulled pork, pulled chicken, and collard greens from Honey Bear's even though I now live miles away (and right between two other BBQ restaurants).  And, for other HB's fans, \"Deal Chicken\" frequently offers coupons for Honey Bear's which cost $15 for $30 worth of food.  Beat THAT!",

When I entered, a pleasant gentleman was wiping tables and he greeted me with a smile and a pleasantness that clearly was natural. He helped me get a take-out menu and suggested several choices. A young man working there was also quite pleasant and I never saw anyone on their cell phone like I have so many times in other restaurants. My food came quickly, was hot, the order was correct, and most importantly, tasted delicious. I am glad I stopped there.",

We got the pulled pork and BBQ chicken. The pork was dry with no smokey flavor. The chicken was drenched in sauce hiding the flavor. The sauce was too sweet for me as well, overpowering everything it's put on.  The sides of beans and corn were nothing  special as well. At the end. We were glad we tried them because it made us feel better about our favorite BBQ, Waldos in Mesa.   We'll keep trying, but we believe no one will ever compare.",

    "text": "I just cannot understand why this place is so highly rated. Could it be that people have never experienced barbeque outside of Arizona, so they have no basis of comparison? But even that cannot be True. We have Joe's in Gilbert, and even Famous Dave's is pretty darn good.   I work a block from this location, so I have been there at least a dozen times. While not great, it is something different once in awhile, so I put in an appearance now and then. The food is not bad, per se, it is just not that good. The prices, on the other hand, are far too high for what you get. $11 gets you a \"large sandwich\" which is not very large, an order of fries, and a soda--RC brands. For a couple of bucks more I could get a combo platter at Famous Daves.   Service is all business. I don't think I have ever seen a smile in the place. But it is fast. The place is usually dirty, but I am usually there right around lunch, so it might be better other times.   Just not impressed at all. But...it beats the Burger King down the street which is the worst BK in Christendom. But that is another review.",

A hotdog dropped on dog crap would probably taste better.   Brisket tasted like water was added to it and microwaved. The Chicken scared me as both pieces looked totally different... like they were cooked on different days.    Potato salad was gross and tasted stale and like a gallon of mustard was used to make it.  Staff was friendly so there is one star that... The other star is for the peach cobbler which was actually good but too saucy and not enough crust.  Never again-- I was so irritated I thought about writing a bad review on the hotel I was staying in...for recommending this place. Just because you reheat something and add bbq sauce to something doesn't make it bbq!!!",

Kind of off putting a bit but still wanted to give this place a shot. We went there at lunch and wasn't busy by any means. Tried to order some brisket and they were out. Also the peach cobbler, which they were out of it too. Not sure how that's possible when it's lunch and they barely opened. Strange!  I really wanted to Mac and cheese so I ended up going with the meaty Mac with pulled pork. I would say this was a pretty good dish and all around plenty of carbs to handle. It's not a huge portion but filling for sure. I do think the Mac and cheese isn't something they made with their own recipe, but more made of cheese that could of been from a can. I do think the pulled pork was pretty tasty and just add a little BBQ sauce made it better  All around not bad, but not great. I do think the service is good and friendly but this isn't a place I would go out of my way for",

A/C was not running (or if it was we couldn't tell) so it was really hot inside, and it was 100+ degrees outside. Food was average, I had the sliders, but didn't finish then. One person in my group had a salad but she said it was soggy and she bearly touched it.  We won't be coming back here.",

Said we'd be there in 10 mins, show up in 15. Told no ribs for your order, as a server walks by w a plate of ribs who says \"yeah, but you haven't paid yet.\" Not a good business plan. Maybe don't take orders over the phone?",

The woman up front and young man who came to check on us were very friendly throughout our meal. Food was delicious are very affordable. The fries were good, but some of them were a bit too crispy. No big deal tho. Overall I'd gladly come back to try other parts of the menu. Only downsides I personally had is the benches were uncomfortable and I'd much rather see shoestring fries or something else other then the crinkle fries.  But dont let my small gripes stop you from enjoying this awesome place",

However that all changed when I brought my dad for a late lunch/early dinner.   We order the full slab with potatoe salad and beans. Man when we got home, the plate was packed with ribs. So much so that the two of us sharing was not a problem. I am not a fan of potatoe salad, however I will admit that theres was quite tasty! The bbw sauce was better than I remember and although my dad enjoyed the sauce, he makes his own and just had to say there's is good but mine is still better. SMH!.   They have revamped the menu to make it a little more affordable and they seemed to have up there portions a tad. Way too go. My dad enjoyed one Phoenix's hometown spots. Good job! I will be back again soon for rib tip Friday's!",

Sure, but when it came time to choose sides, they had some bullshit rules so you can only get 3 different sides even though they're giving you 6 total large and small containers. Why? Stupid policy, especially for an introductory offer.   The staff is rude, uppity, and difficult to understand. The cashier seemed like a very unhappy person and made ordering a chore. I mean really, how hard is it to stay in mac n cheese. And if we cant choose sweet potato fries as a side, then don't call it a side. But what I really thought was classy was when we picked up our food after our number was blurted out. Three employees stood there and ignored us as we checked our order and made our way out of the \"restaurant.\"  The food would have to be ambrosia for us to make the trek here again. And it wasn't. The food was ok. I will never go back to this location. Period. May try the Tempe location but will stick with Lucille's. Sorry I strayed girl.  ***Thank you Anna for the professional response.

Regular smoked sausage would be a VERY welcome option for those of us who would not like to burn off their tastebuds but enjoy a good porky item. The bbq sauce is very good, but could benefit with a touch more sweetness and less pepper flakes.  Generally I love spicy food, but too spicy can be distracting and can sometimes send you to the bathroom repeatedly for a few days! Lol  Now, the good stuff. Mac and cheese can be heavenly, but the quality has been inconsistent over many visits. Some days, it is considerably less creamy and fresh than others. When its done right, I could make a meal of it.   The potato salad is tangy, delicious, and the sides are a substantial, which is appreciated.   I was sad to see they took off the delectable little corn muffins they had briefly on the menu :( good cornbread can be hard to find.  Be careful not to back over other patrons in the parking lot! Its a little tight! Lol",

I ordered a half lb of pulled pork and two sides. They ended up \"finding\" some ribs for one of the orders, but there were obviously boiled or pressure-cooked and not slow smoked.. The chicken came out 10 minutes after the rest of the food, and it was also either microwaved or pressure cooked.. My food, (which was ordered a couple of minutes after theirs) took over 30 minutes to arrive.  I overheard them telling the people sitting behind me that they were out of almost everything..  Then, to top it all off, we were overcharged.  We showed them a four square check in which was supposed to get me one free side, but I was still charged for both my sides. The cashier girl was new and obviously in WAY over her head.   I was so embarrassed after raving about this place, to have it be so very bad...",

With my credit of $24 and a few extra dollars, I ordered a full rack of pork ribs which included two sides (I chose collared greens & sweet potato fries-- small upcharge that I was not informed of), 1/2lb of hot links and a few free dinner buns.   The ribs were fairly good (3 stars) albeit a bit dry-- I guess that's why they drown it in BBQ sauce. The hot links however were dissssgusting. (0 stars). Just thinking about it makes me want to puke. It was so soft, I quickly tossed out the serving that was on my plate and what was left in the container. They are what I imagine vienna sausages would taste like (but spicy, of course).   Collared greens & sweet potato fries were edible.. not cringeworthy (like the hot links), but not worth the calories/stomach space either.   Service was friendly & efficient.   Warning: be prepared to swat flies if you dine in. There were several on the day I was in... ick!",

For one thing, they make a mean pulled pork sandwich. Tender, juicy, and well-seasoned. Their BBQ sauce is the watery kind...I don't know what region that is from, but it's tasty. It's not something I am used to, and I don't think I have seen it anywhere else (so if you have any tips on that, let me know). Prices are super cheap and the guys behind the counter are friendly. This is just one of your local dives, but I am a fan.   The pulled pork, beef, or chicken sandwiches are my favorites, but they make decent ribs. Their chicken can be a little under-seasoned/dry though. They also have REALLY ADDICTING French Fries. I'm a sucker for seasoned salt. Their sweet potato pie is also good. Free parking, decent hours, and TVs to watch the game over some BBQ and some beers.",

Though I was a little afraid of the area and the sketchy look of the place I was taken by a good friend and my visiting father so I couldn't say no.  We all ordered sandwiches; I had the brisket and my father ordered a half order of ribs for us to share.  Now I have to say I'm not a BBQ person.  I'm not a fan of 99% of the sauce out there.  I reluctantly gave it a try and almost had to sit on my now saucy hands to keep from eating the whole plate.  The brisket was decent, but nothing compared to the ribs.  I've been here probably about 25 times since my first visit and now exclusively get ribs.  The sides in my opinion aren't really worth mentioning.  The coleslaw had as much black pepper in it as any other ingredient and the cowbro beans are kinda spicy.  The mac n cheese is good, not kraft or velveeta but not special.  The ribs are definitely the way to go for a happy full belly.",

    "text": "I really want to like this place because the food is pretty good and they have vintage soda brands, but they make it pretty tough. My two biggest issues are the price and the employees. If you want a sandwich, side, and a drink you will be paying $12-$15. It's not a \"sit-down\" restaurant, and the prices are absurd for the portion size and quality that you get. It's not that it isn't good- it's that it is not worth the price. Problem #2 is the staff- they make you feel like you are inconveniencing them by placing your order and giving them money. I think I asked about what came on a sandwich and I received a long sigh and one finger pointed up to the menu, but the menu doesn't tell you...that's why people ask questions. I don't need a deep conversation or anything, but respect the people the are keeping you in business.There is better BBQ in the valley at a much better price, this place is popular because of its location.",

    "text": "I'm feeling extra nice today, so Honey Bears gets 3 stars instead of 2.  We were really hungry after work and couldn't decide on a place, but since we drive down Central and see this place everyday, we figured now was as good a time as ever to give it a shot.  My first sight upon entering was a couple hookers sittin and eatin bbq.  I wasn't sure if that was a good sign or a bad sign, but they were definitely hookers.  Anyway, I stared up at the menu for about 30 seconds (it's pretty small) and decided on a regular bbq beef sandwich and a side of cole slaw.  For two sandwiches and two sides the total came to about 14 bucks.  Not bad!  They also have RC cola in their soda fountain, so that may tickle your fancy.  Not mine.  The food came out in a matter of 2 minutes and we unwrapped our foil covered sandwiches to find... not enough bbq sauce.  They charge extra.  LAME!  The meat was fine, but a little too dry for my taste.  It was pretty good when it had some of the sauce on it.  The cole slaw was okay, better than most places, except it was over peppered to me, but definitely still tasty.  I probably won't go back here, as nothing really stood out to me, but it was good enough for a 20 minute meal.",

Let me sum it up: we ordered the 9.95 (sandwich, side & drink combo) the beef was burnt dry, the sauce reminded of a grade up from Arby sauce & the fries tasted stale. I Thought I was being  negative but my husband who's not too picky complained more than me. To top it off, we were charged extra for a side we didn't order when we presented this to the cashier she swore we ordered it, we didn't! She finally gave us 1/2 a refund saying we didn't get tax back because of groupon..... huh???? Our original order came to 18.00 the groupon was for 20.  Whatever!   We're never going back!!",

    "text": "I was disappointed. I love good BBQ, and I'm sure Honey Bear's has some good dishes. I guess my experience was about what I received for the price, not taste, as the food was on par for BBQ.  Not bad, not great. I arrived for lunch 11:45am on a Thursday to find they were out of all their BBQ pork, and all sandwiches with the exception of their beef. What? Out of the most popular BBQ dishes?  On a Thursday?  Right before lunch? Whaaaa?  But, I was told their special today was ribs, one side, a biscuit, and a drink for $12-something. I figured $12 was a little steep, but since I don't have BBQ too often, I'd go ahead and splurge a little. Anyway, when they called my number I felt confused. \"Uh, scuse me, I ordered the special, not whatever this half-order was.\" Did they forget something?  Nope, no mistake, that was mine.  Wow, this is $12+ bucks? Really? I guess I thought I'd get a little more food for a \"special\". This lunch, as pictured, was $13.56 after tax. I feel ripped off. When did BBQ get so expensive?  Because it's good?  Y'know what else is good?  LOTS OF OTHER KINDS OF FOOD!  Anyway, I was disappointed, and probably won't go back.  There's a few other BBQ joints in the area, I'll hit one of them next time.  BTW, if you find yourself in my position, standing at the counter, baffled by the high prices and minimal selection, go ahead and walk next door, literally 30 feet, to the Philly Cheese steak restaurant.  More food, cheaper price. Just my opinion.",

    "text": "Got a family meal deal for home consumption.  Two slabs of ribs had plenty of meat on them (not baby back, but pork), came chopped up.  Two adults and 2 kids, despite gorging ourselves, only ate about 75%.  Their sauce is frankly exceptional.  But the sides... well... sucked.  The corn was watery (they must soak in hot water for a day or two).  The potato salad, while having the skin of red potatos and being pretty decent, had a strong dill taste that I liked but I couldn't get kids or wife to enjoy.  The rolls aren't good... but most aren't at these kinds of places.  What pissed me off the most was that they forgot one of the sides... mac and cheese.  Anyway, here's what i got out of the deal.. I will come back for the ribs.  And WILL absolutely come back for the sauce.  In fact, I may just come get a tub of sauce and BBQ my own ribs if I'm not feeling particularly lazy.    Meat = Good Sides = Bad Sauce = Exceptional (5 Stars)  Enjoy!",

The cole slaw was sweet and creamy, not dry and bland like at other places.  The corn on the cob was pipping hot, sweet and tasty.  Honey Bear's I will definitely return for lunch soon!",

The bun was pretty cheap and mushy after being soaked through. Bbq sauce was nothing special. Fries were standard. It wouldn't have been such a disaster if i hadn't paid $10.49 (not including tax) for the lunch time meal. I won't be back. Prices are too high for standard fare.",

I had 2 bbq beef sandwiches because they were out of the pulled pork.  While eating my sandwiches I had the thought there should be laws enacted to constitute what restaurants can call bbq.  Boiled meat covered in BBQ sauce is NOT BBQ.   I grew up in the South, I've been to Memphis in May a couple of times, so my standards for BBQ are admittedly higher than average, but this was not even close to real BBQ.  Was it decent food.  Sure.  Decent, at best.  Was it the reason I got an upset stomach a couple hours later, possibly.   I don't care about the old decor, dirty looking bathrooms or anything else, if the food was good I would go back.  It wasn't.",

I do not love Chicken. But, this was pretty good I have to say. We got some to go as well. The Cole Slaw was pretty tasty as well ,and seemed really fresh. I like the sause here,you can even get it to go. Meaning that you can buy bottles of it to take home. Parking is around the back and a little tight.

    "text": "First review but not the first time here.  Originally came here because well I did enjoy the Van Buren location.  On a day that well, I wanted Quantity over Quality.... A point I will explore soon.  Upon entering I had already referenced the other reviews of this location. Seemed about average so naturally i prepared myself to not be impressed.  First things first.  The place was a bit of a mess (being gracious with my language). I understand it was at the end of their lunch rush but still... if your a staple of any city your image is very important so Tidy Up! Also there is nothing wrong with the idea of a remodel in certain areas like the bathroom and table area.   *I almost always suggest an open kitchen for any eating establishment. I mean who wouldn't enjoy seeing my meats being cooked and smoked as I am contemplating my order at the register? right?  Price... a bit overpriced for the QUALITY I received and even the QUANTITY was not what I expected for what I paid.  Ordered the Pork sandwich meal with Sweet potato fries. Pork was dry and burnt, flavorless too, which I'm sure is easy to get away with since anyone who is in there usually sloshes their sandwiches in that BBQ sauce... not good enough for me or most foodies I'm sure. The fries where and had been frozen obviously, ughh.... like really? and to top it off they were also bland (doused them in BBQ sauce just like my sandwich to try to save them)  My girlfriend and her mom had ordered the same thing. but with different sides. Her Mac n Cheese looked awfully fast food/michelina's of them. Also to top it off after being home for about an hour or so and even through the rest of the evening me and m'lady felt awfully sick (Not a surprise considering if you take a gander into the kitchen from the soda fountain it looks like quite a mess back there....)  I will not be visiting again on my own account but also some people I lunch with are stuck in their ways. Id like to see a remodel, food quality improved to reflect proper pricing, CLEANLINESS (not just at my table when i have to clean it myself but in the KITCHEN) and well all those smiles people are saying they do not see there will come to the employees naturally. I see some obvious pride lost in the owners and employees alike.  I never like to see a business fail. Especially one that has such a familiar name her in Phoenix. Best of luck to you guys.",

Since I moved to Phoenix two years ago, many have said Honey Bear's BBQ was the place to go.  I have been twice now.  The first time I got a platter selection of ribs, pulled pork, pulled brisket and chicken.  The most remarkable point was how dry and old the chicken seemed.  had I gotten there too early to be served yesterday's reheated chicken?  The sides were just OK.  the store is beaten down with laminated booths and a dark interior.  Maybe built in 1979 and never remodeled.  This week i went again and got just a pulled brisket sandwich.  the brisket was good, tender and moist.  It came with sauce already added, i would have preferred to add my own quantity of sauce.  the bun was a simply white bread roll, nothing special.  The sweet potato tater tots were OK, not as tasty as I had hoped.  The coleslaw was average.    1 Star for BBQ 1 star for a successful pulled brisket sandwich.  If Booby-Q was closer, i would be heading there for lunch instead of Honey Bear's BBQ.  PS - they were busy at lunch, so there must be some fans around.",

Town Talk doesn't open until 11:00, and Honey Bear's opens at 10:00! Honey Bear's sits right next to another of my favorites(Best of Philly).  When you walk in, there's a counter right in front of you. Menu is a little confusing, but just tell them what you want. Even though it was lunch, I had a half slab of pork ribs with potato salad. Their ribs are probably my second or third favorite ribs I have eaten. Ribs have a lot of meat, very good smoke taste, not the tenderest ribs I have had but nothing wrong with it. Potato salad was very good also, little different from what I am use to.  Price wise is about what is expected for ribs. Half slab of ribs(meaty), potato salad, order of fries, plus a drink. for about $20.00 Very happy with my meal, will diffidently come back.",

This results in smaller bites of meat - but - a higher ratio of sauce to meat with each bite.Honey Bears sauce is right on, and the meat is so tender. Finger licking good spare ribs. This is a Soul Food rib joint.  Sides - fresh, crispy,creamy, tangy cole slaw. Beans - interesting seasoning, afew chunks of hot link, and I think chopped up pickles? Really good.

The meat was unseasoned and bland...although juicy and tender enough.  The bun sauce is uneventful.  And for 5 bucks, I want better. The first time I got a sandwich, it was bought to me from the Tempe location.  The 2nd time I went to the Central location.  The service was non-descript, which I guess isn't a bad thing.  The place looked nice, though.  Neat and clean.  And there were a lot of people eating, so the stuff is good to someone...just not me.  I figure if you can't get a pulled pork sandwich right, I'd be an idiot to try your ribs or chicken.  So, I guess Honey Bears is on my Nope-List.  Too bad, cause its so convient from work.   I will, however, go back and try their catfish.  If they get that right, I'll throw another star at them.",

    "text": "Okay, honestly, Honey Bear's couldn't hang in Memphis, Birmingham, Houston, or Lockhart  ... and fortunately for them, they don't need to 'hang' because they are smoking their meats in the BBQ wasteland of Phoenix, AZ.    Because I fancy myself a BBQ expert (note: I'm more of a brisket purist), its difficult to rate HB's based on the integrity of the THEIR OWN meat and not as a comparison to others Valley and Nation-wide. This is exactly 'why' I think many of their rating suffer because everyone has undoubtedly had better BBQ elsewhere, wherever you may hail from, and it takes a stringent push from one's own natural reflexes to resist matching HBs up to 'local awesome BBQ joint'.  BBQ connoisseurs are funny like that.  So, overall, HB's earns a 3-star based on the following:  Pork Ribs - I'm more of a beef rib expert, but these ribs were generous and plentiful in their combo plate.  I was surprised that there was very likely a whole half-rack on my plate.  They are very tasty even without the sauce, with a nice peppery rub that did not dry out the meat.  Smoked Chicken - Juicy but slightly greasy.  This is amongst the most difficult smoked meat to pull off due to the propensity for it to become a stringy, dehydrated mess.  I don't think I would order it again, but the flavor was pretty decent and I don't regret trying it.  Pulled Pork - I got a 1/2 lb of pulled pork as a side meat, along with a couple of extra buns to make as a half-sandwich (a glob of meat on a half bun, folded over like a taco).  This is the only time I typically use sauce to counterbalance the white bread, whether its pork, brisket, or sausage.  I was surprised by how dry the pork was, particularly because pork is fatty and juicy, but here at HB's it was extra lean.  I thought I would hate the pork bc of this fact, but the sauce saves it from being a choking bolus of pig and flour.  Now I understand why they typically put this on a full bun and drown it in sauce.  As the 'specialty' of this restaurant, its kind of a gaffe that the quality is poor, but as a consumer, I'd order it again in limited amounts, and only as a 'side'.  Why?  Because I can provide my own perfect ratio of bread:pork:sauce.  Otherwise, I don't think that HB's could build me a pulled pork sandwich I could be happy with.  Sauce - If you don't know any better you'd think it was tip-top.  Sure, its 'pretty good', but its most-definitely a one-note mixture.  Too sweet for their peppery rubs.  A spicier sauce would do the trick better, IMO.  Corn on the Cob - Serviceable, but soggy and strangely devoid of spices typical of southern cuisine.  Cowbro Beans - Awesome.  Smokey flavor, thick sauce, and chunks of their smoked sausage.  Great compliment to a BBQ dinner.  Soda Fountain - The city's best.  BBQ restaurant staples such as 1a) Dr Pepper 1b) Big Red.  Their 'cola' is RC and they have Hines Rootbeer, Sunkist, Country Time Lemonade, and 7-Up.  They did some solid research on the fluid necessities of BBQ palates.  They also have a fridge of beer.  Price -  All that, which I described above came out to $33 with a large tip because the guy behind the counter was very cool.  It fed two hungry people during the season finale of LOST, with plenty extra for leftovers.  Very pleased in this area.  Overall - Hey, its PHX, and here we are better adapted to 'fill-ins' for our favorite spots back home.  It happens in every culinary category, from philly cheesesteaks to fish n chips; gnocchi to Q.  Why should this place be any different?",

    "text": "This is really one of the more disappointing BBQ places in Phx.  I hate to disrespect Honey Bears but their pulled pork is just too dry.  I shouldn't have to cover it in your bbq sauce (which isn't THAT good either) in order to make it edible.  Also, if you are going to churn out dry pork, you have got a lot of nerve charging for more bbq sauce.  I've never had anything else here but the fact that the pork isn't all that good is all I need to know.  I'll stick with Stacey's down the road.",

Everything we tried to order they were out of. Would never come back here again. A waste of money for a small, relatively tasteless overpriced sandwich and no side items.",

My sister from Alabama saw the peach cobbler on the menu and spoke with the cook who assured her it was fresh, hand peeled peaches and homemade.  My sister is quite the critic of peaches.  OK, the peach cobbler is the best there is.  No comparison - excellent *****.  Eat here you won't be disappointed!",

Take it with a grain of salt because I'm not like a huge BBQ buff at all, but I seriously don't think it tastes much better than ribs from say, Chili's or some chain resteraunt. BBQ sauce is BBQ sauce to me. It tastes the same as Kraft BBQ sauce from the bottle.",

I got the 1/2 rack pork ribs $11.49, which were tender, moist and fall off the bone good. The sauce was slightly hot, sweet and vinegary. Comes with 2 sides, I got cole slaw which was average good, and the Browbeans which had BBQ sauce, and sausage pieces, a very good choice. I got a peach cobbler dessert, and I liked it but it is kinda average, the crust parts were mixed in with the cobbler and were soggy, to bad, it was probably very good before that was done.",
