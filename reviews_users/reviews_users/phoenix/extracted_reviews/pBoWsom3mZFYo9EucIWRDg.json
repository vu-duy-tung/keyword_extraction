I have recently had better at Nakama and Fresh Wasabi.  We had a very nice waitress though, she was helpful and kind.  I am sure when we are in the area, and hungry for it, we will come back, but I do hope they are aware of their quality declining somewhat and improve it... :)",

I recently went to Kabuki in Peoria for the first time, and when I walked in, I was impressed with the atmosphere. The tables seem comfortable and the ambiance is above average.  The sushi lunch specials are insufficient for my appetite, so I chose to go with the Rainbow Roll and California roll.  They were wrapped well and tasted good. The food was what I expected; not really any better than any other place I can think of. For $20 (without drink) for lunch, it was a bit expensive compared to other sushi places I frequent. I think my expectations were too high. There's really nothing too positive or negative about my experience... I was just hoping for better lunch offerings that didn't involve tempura or teriyaki.",

This establishment also serves chicken teriyaki which is served with white rice and cabbage salad with that incredible \"mystery\" dressing. You know what I am talking about right? That orange/pinky colored dressing that ALL teriyaki joints serve. Oh gosh, I just LOVE that dressing.  Ok, anyway...back to the review.....its a great place for two to dine OR for a smallish group.

I ordered a combination California roll sushi platter with no avocado it was made with avocado. We also ordered the Unagi roll which came to the table barely warm not hot. The server never came to check on us. Our server was horrible and not very attentive. Another server delivered our food. She didn't even offer to replace the California rolls. I was paying for the bill and asked for them to credit the California roll. Instead they handed me a to go bag and said that they had made me another order of California roll with No avocado. I told them multiple times I did not want a replacement! NEGATIVE 5 stars!!!! Will NOT go back.  To top it off they add their own gratuity and we only had 6 people. We spent $202.00 I should have gone to the bait shop and spent $50.00 we would have had a better meal.",

We probably won't dine there again, their miso soup tasted strange, they probably used chicken stock instead of bonito (dashi), I was very disappointed. Sushi was okay but I want more sushi vinegar. My huband didn't like their rice, tonkatsu was okay but too thin. Since I'm Japanese and moved from SF bay area, I could be a picky food critic. I went to Tomo, Kabuki in Glendale, Akai Hana and here, unfortunately they are about same. With this economy all the restaurants are trying to survive, but we need good Japanese restaurants in west side of Phoenix. I just found better, cheaper and fresh sushi in Fry's supermarket in Goodyear. It worth to try and you don't have to pay tip. LOL",

    "text": "Warning number one: let me start this review by saying beware all those from the East side -- this is not the same as Kabuki in Tempe.   Our experience at Kabuki was disappointing to me, especially after I chose the restaurant based on Yelp reviews.   Seating was prompt and pleasant for our party of five. It was an early meal, and the restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived. Our waiter had his hands full, and, to his credit, we were a table of 3 sushi amateurs and 2 sushi snobs all vying for his attention. Despite this bonus credit, he was very \"first day on the job.\"   We ordered a few apps, including the gyoza and misos. The gyoza was well received and the misos were standard issue.   Next on to the courses, the timing of which was horrible. We made it very clear to the waiter that two of us would be having sushi as our main, and the rest would be having entrees. Unfortunately, this was completely disregarded resulting in a gap so large that the person with the first entree served was nearly finished when the last entree arrived. Not sure if this was a wait staff or kitchen issue, either way it was problematic and a HUGE peeve of mine.  In the midst of all this the specialty rolls we ordered, the Hawaiian and the Caterpillar, were served -- along with the eel, salmon roe and tuna rolls. The straight sushi was very good -- the tuna was fresh, the roe not fishy. The eel was a bit drier than what I would prefer, but the flavor was spot on -- not cloyingly sweet or over sauced.  Unfortunately, the specialty rolls were so vile I actually had to be \"that\" person and send them back. It was a shame, as they looked stunning and were very generous portions. But ... this brings us to warning number two -- Crabmeat on their menu actually means Krab meat -- as in the imitation stuff, and not just in the California roll where we all expect it (and I can avoid it). It seems to make an appearance in ALL of their specialty rolls -- complete with mayo. Yuck.  Now, I realize every place has their own spin, but frankly I found the whole thing to be appalling -- I've never seen a Caterpillar roll that includes Krab. And the Hawaiian just made sense to have real crab, given the other ingredients.   The hostess or manager, not sure who she was but nonetheless lending a hand, was very gracious in accommodating a prompt removal of these sushi abortions and supplying additional tuna and spicy tuna rolls (which were both VERY good). I give major points to them for handling the situation well.    While I was very disappointed with my experience, it wasn't all bad. Had we not had the service issues, I likely would not have sent the sushi back, but by that point I was already getting a bit on edge. So, I won't trash the place, because god knows there aren't enough independents on that side of town, and the items done well -- particularly the spicy tuna and teriyaki  -- were very good. So my advice if you're not of the Krab loving persuasion -- stick to the basics, and you'll do alright.",

    "text": "First off - we were looking for somewhere to eat in the west valley and Kabuki Sushi popped up on the GPS as being nearby. Thinking it was the same Kabuki that is at Tempe Marketplace and Westgate I was excited. Um. Yeah. Definitely not the same place. I'll start with the good:  - Service was very attentive and friendly (actually, the service sort of saved this from being a 1-star experience) - Huge selection of specialty rolls - Kid-friendly (the sushi chefs even entertained my daughter)  Now, the bad.  - The place smelled like fish. Not a good sign. - 99% of the rolls were made with \"crabmeat\". Even the Philly roll, which is very very odd.  - The food was very expensive for the quality. Two rolls made with mostly crabmeat and some nigiri, plus a couple 4.50 beers, quickly became a 70 dollar \"quick bite.\" - The menu has pictures. Not very appetizing pictures.  I probably should have known better than to eat sushi anywhere in the avenues. And I'm still kind of baffled by how there can be two completely different restaurants in the same city with the same name? Either way, I will actively seek another alternative next time I'm in that area.",

Great atmosphere, great music, and their hallway to the bathroom is filled with pictures of  baseball players and celebrities which is pretty awesome. The sushi rolls I got were amazing especially for the size of the roll which is way bigger then pretty much every sushi place I have ever been to. My favorite rolls are the Seared Albacore roll, Lauren roll, Kim roll. and Vegas roll. An appetizer that is a must try is spicy poki or tako (octopus) salad!",

Several of the rolls fell apart and since I am not experienced with chop sticks, I asked for a fork.

Nice display of major league athletic team stuff including a whole wall of photos of the staff with major league players who have visited the restaurant.  Our waitperson was delightful.  The Spicy Poke Salad was the best I've had since I left San Francisco.  We asked for it with tuna only.  I'd make the trip back just for this.  We managed to polish off a Philly Roll, and Tiger Roll and a Rainbow Roll with very little effort, but we waddled out when we left.  I've never had a Rainbow Roll that was totally wrapped in shrimp!!! FANTASTIC.  I would definitely go back; in fact this might be my new favorite sushi place.",

They are kinda on the higher end of pricing but for good sushi it's understandable and I can live with it. Dynamite roll is very amazing and will fill you up. Now for the staff... Most of the time I really don't mind the hosts and waitresses/waiters they have on staff but I go in here quiet frequently.(work really close) and sometimes they are just so dang rude. Really? If you honestly hate your job that much. Leave. I really don't wanna say don't go here but I hope you get a good staff that night.  For now the convince that it's right by my work is great. But if I'm going out with my hubby or out with the girls. Kabuki at Westgate is the place to go happy hour is to die for and the staff is always super nice and helpful.",

Note to self if I don't remember, then I didn't like it. The food was not great. The service sucked and it was expensive.   Most rolls were $12-$13. I ordered the Hawaiian roll which was supposed to have tuna and avocado on top.  What I got was definitely not worth the price.   It was a slow night and we sat at the bar. The server brought us water and then disappeared for the night. Never came back to check on us or offer us more water or drinks. The sushi chef did give us a sample of a spicy tuna roll. However, shortly after that he made the worst noise anyone can make in the middle of dinner. He cleared his throat of phlegm.   Needless to say, I will never go back to this place again.",

    "text": "Love sushi but haven't been able to find one worth returning to in AZ.  Lets start with the chicken/pork katsu. First off, get an extra side of the katsu sauce, you'll need it. Then take a bite and you'll quickly realize you can't stop eating it.. but wait! Save space for the sushi, that's why you're here right?  If you don't eat sashimi, shame on you. Try it, share it, love it. It's packed with fresh thick cuts of fish that satisfy my food cravings. Or try the Phoenix and Lauren rolls; one baked with lobster, oozing with a medley of flavors and the other topped with decadent white tuna creating a simple almost buttery flavor.   It's a bit pricey but why go get cheaper sushi when it doesn't taste any good? Also, the holiday decorations and music are a plus.",

    "text": "I gave my first review of this establishment back on Nov 2010 and as for the food, it still stands as a great time.  The food is delicious.  Id like to review the visit this time.    My gifrleind and a friend all went to Kabuki for some Sushi because I had been craving it for a long while.  The last few times we've gone there it's always been a pretty good visit.  Quick service. Good food.   We walk in and are seated.  It's a little crowded, but nothing we've seen before.  They have about 5-6 people waiting tables or hosting or doing something.  A waiter asks us for our drinks and I throw in an order of edemame and some belly buttons.    ..and the wait begins.  Id say it was bout 10-15min before our appetizers got in and the waiter felt the need to tell us the edemame was '\"fresh!\" ... i guess that's lingo for \"It's gonna be a while.\"  Finally they bring it along with the belly buttons.  During our wait we decided to put in our food order.  We got about three different types of sushi.  Nothing super fancy with a volcano exploding with fire shooting out the ends... just some regular sushi.  I kid you not, it was about 30min before my girlfriend could not hold back and finally asked the waiter why it was taking so long.   Apparently they had just two people before making sushi.  Well ya know what? We've been there before when just one guy was there and it was faster service.  We got our food finally, but instead of bringing it all at once, they brought two then one.  Ok fine... Im hungry.  We eat our food and get our bill..  The bill comes out to roughly $55.  With a tip we all decided to split the bill three ways.  Two of us had cards and put $22.00 on each and one had cash and did $22.00 so they had a tip.  Not rocket science right?  He walks away with our cards and cash and literally 10min later we all get up disgusted..  \"Can we have our checks to sign?\"  The girl pipes in \"Oh they are right here..\" I guess they didn't think we needed to sign anything.  I saw my bill for $22 and put a slash through the tip and signed  and we walked out.  (remember.. we left the tip in cash).  So Saturday morning I check my banking online from my phone just as we were heading out of town.   A nice little note on my bank statement:  CHKCARDKABUKI SUSHI & PEORIA AZUS     $55.38   What the!???   Why the hell was my card charged for the full bill.  Did they decide to go back and charge my card the full amount because we were unhappy with their service??  Disgusted we called them and supposedly they are taking care of it.  It's Monday morning (when banks do their normal run through) and my banking statement still shows the same.  Love the food Kabuki, but you lost three customers because of the poor service; and we will not be coming back.  ---------------  Update.. they fixed my account, but the service was still snail slow that day.",

Kabuki is an excellent example of this.  Sit at the bar and strike up a chat with one of the sushi chefs. Let them recommend their favorite dishes to you.   Whether I visit this place for lunch or dinner, I always leave happy. The staff is friendly and the food is great.  Pick a designated driver and then ask for a bottle of soju - our favorite Korean alcohol. Try an appetizer (maybe whatever is on special); Edamame is great of you are new to this kind of food. Have some soju. Have a roll or two... I like the Rainbow Roll, myself. Have some more soju. Maybe end the meal with some sashimi; then more soju.  Tip them. You'll be happy.",

They have an amazing deal where you can get two rolls and and an appetizer for just $15! Delighted by this news, I ordered the crunch roll and the tempura california roll (basically a golden rush roll) plus a two piece salmon. Normally when you get happy hour rolls, the portions and the size of the rolls are much smaller. But not here! The rolls and nigiri were quite large which took me by surprise. The food was delicious and I ended up having to take some home cause I couldn't finish it all! Not only was the food tasty, but the service and atmosphere were great as well. Needless to say, I will definitely be coming back again!",

Everyone we asked either cringed at the idea of eating something uncooked or had no clue where a decent place may be located.  Now, since this was a weekend of debauchery and I was continuously mildly inebriated, I decided to throw my search into the Yelp app and see where it took us.  Kabuki it was!  They did have happy hour, but unfortunately the drink specials were only somewhat decent.  Come on, $10 for a large sake/large beer?  I can get that for half price in Cali.  Oh well, let's order a couple anyway.  The edamame was aight, the rolls were just ehhh, I mean, I didn't get sick or anything, but they weren't the freshest (we just had the spicy tuna and the caterpillar roll).  We had ordered another specialty roll which sounded delicious, but the chef started with those two, and after we realized those would be more than enough, we cancelled the final roll.  I really liked that he held off on that final roll, it was as if he knew that our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and wanted to give us time to realize that.  All I know is that next time I find myself heading to AZ, I will be sure to get my sushi fix here in Cali beforehand.",

The other rolls were edible and average. There was 1 sushi chef and he was extremely slow. We received 1 roll every 10-15 minutes it seemed. I saw manager in the back kitchen standing around who did not check on his Sushi chef but once. So it was a different environment than I'm used too meaning professionally ran restaurants with friendly staff and a sense of urgency are my choice.",

    "text": "This place is my go-to if I need a sushi fix. Service is always excellent, the drinks are delicious and priced well (try the watermelon martini or the Long Island iced tea), and the food is incredible. The servers always offer us miso soup, which is full of delicious delicate flavor and not overly salty. I've had pretty much every sushi roll on the menu (and there are TONS to choose from) and have yet to try one I don't like. Their spicy tuna is truly spicy and is an ingredient in lots of the rolls, which is awesome because it's pretty much my favorite thing ever.   Try the Glen Roll if you love the spicy stuff. The Salmon Tempura Roll is delicious, and a great choice for those who love sushi but prefer a cooked option. The Rainbow Roll is topped with 5 different kinds of some of the freshest raw fish I've ever had.   Dining room is small, but has plenty of seating options. The sushi bar wraps around the back corner of the dining room. They also do take out orders, and I enjoy the take out just as much as I enjoy dining in. I've been to Kabuki more times than I can count, and they haven't disappointed me once.",

They forgot a sushi roll as we waited like morons. Horrible service, the rolls(2)  were mediocre and rushed. The only thing they managed to do correct was getting me beer. I guess it's all a scheme. Wouldn't recommend. You are better off getting sushi from frys market place for less money. I'm alla about support to food spots as I am a foodie. But this place mad made me mad I even had to pay for such crap. Take it or leave it it is what it is and it sucks.",

Absolutely horrible service. Our drinks were not filled to the top .. they looked like the waitress took a drink from them . We were not given silverware.. I actually got up and went to the waiters table myself and got the napkins and silver ware. The waitress forgot half of our order. Them blamed it on the lunch rush . However there was only like 5 or so people here . I am extremely disappointed in this place. We come to this area all the time. And we wanted to try something new ..

I like that the menu has good descriptions and color pictures!  F - Lobster Roll - This was baked and just absolutely amazing, it's rare to have warm sushi and this definitely his the spot A - Hawaiian Crunch -  Q - Sarenda Roll -   I can't remember A and Q, but one was spicy tuna and the other salmon.  Both were very good and had a more refreshing cleanness to them  The miso soup was the best I had ever had, not just floaty crap all over but nice thick and had some good taste to it!  I normally hate miso soup, and last time I had it, it was acceptable (that was a year or two ago since I actually live in Chicago), but this time it was great and I'd order it again!",

The food was very good, service was fantastic (our sushi chef was one of the owners), and the food presentation was beautiful. We have since gone back another time and enjoyed it just as much. Their menu is very extensive with dozens of amazing rolls to choose from. We had the Poke Bowl both times and were NOT disappointed! Very filling and super tasty! I can't say enough about the food at this place. My friend and I do Paint Nite outings a couple times per month and we will be heading over to Kabuki every time we're in the area. Truly a gem of a sushi place!",

We sat at the bar area and were given complimentary edamame and served some drinks. We only ended up waiting about 30 minutes, which was nice!  The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. Some of us ordered sushi with specific ingredients left out and everything came out perfectly!   I ordered the lotus roll with lobster on top of a California roll and it was delicious! There were so many options on the menu but everyone was ordering sushi so I felt inclined to! But I'm looking forward to coming back and ordering the spicy seafood udon or the soups!",

I have had better sushi but it was not bad at all. The fish was good. I thought the rice in the sushi was a little bland and not flavored well enough.  The worst part was how long it took for us to get the sushi. We ordered at 5:50pm and finally got the sushi at 6:50pm. Others in our party were already done with their short ribs and chicken for 20min when the sushi finally came.  I won't be going there again. $15 for a sushi roll that was very late and was just OK in taste.",

The rice was a little stiffer and compacted in the nigiri than I would have liked but overall good. Not sure if it was due to the odd timing of day that we came in in the afternoon but our food came out in segments and the flow wasn't quite in tune to other sushi bars with the variety we ordered. The timing of our meal was off, server was pretty checked out although there were only two other tables when we were seated. Nothing special to note.",

We also had beef udon, this isn't a noodle house so we got some pretty average beef udon which is expected of course and it was tasty and filling! The prices are normal for a sushi restaurant and the service was great. They even let us try some poke! It tasted better than most poke restaurants I go to. I'm overall great experience.",

That seems to be an unwelcome challenge in our neighborhood.   4 star SERVICE: Amanda was so much fun and made our night! Loved the cocktails esp my Tokyo teas!  3 star FOOD: solid but not amazing. We were hungry so everything seemed good but most of their rolls are variations on a theme. Take a basic combo roll and then keep adding another ingredient and it becomes more and more differently named rolls. That being said, the bombs and pink lady were quite good. Most of their rolls are either heavily sauced or flavored so hard to figure out how  good the fish actually was. But I did enjoy the mackerel much to Amanda's surprise. Garlic edamame was solid.   Overall, it was a fun night w Amanda with solid food but would only return if I had another large group.",

The Yelp reviews were pretty clear that the bar's food was subpar. My friend asked if we wanted to try this place for sushi. Being from Seattle, it's hard to find decent fish in the dessert. But, you're equally hard pressed to find decent Mexican food up there.  The quality of the fish is unmatched; it's so fresh you'd cry tears of joy. I hadn't ever had a poke bowl before, but it had everything in it that I enjoy eating. I've been hooked ever since. I definitely get cravings for their food.   One of the owners was our sushi chef, and he's very kind. I mentioned that I hadn't ever had eel before, so he gave my friend and me generous samples to taste. Nom, nom, nom.   I don't like Americanized roles-mayo on rice? That's just not right. Their selection of rolls is diverse enough to accommodate me. I highly recommend the Pink Princess Roll. It's a painting on the plate and a party for your mouth. Both the unagi and poke bowls are a must. The unagi is just so savory. And if you are a carnivore, don't forget the teriyaki beef roll.   The restaurant is always kept very clean; clean bathrooms mean a clean kitchen, too. Several of the employees have been working there since there restaurant opened. That, to me, speaks volumes about the efficiency and the quality of the place. The servers always are polite and upbeat.   This has become my favorite sushi place in Phoenix. It's about 25 min away from my house, but I'm always willing to make the drive for good food.",

I'm definitely not a professional sea-food critic, but I've eaten at at least 6 different sushi places in valley.  Kabuki is one of my favorites thus far...especially for the price.  Vegas roll was awesome, and their Shrimp spring roll was very delicate, and tasted fresh.  The edamame appetizer for free was a nice touch as well.  I'd definitely recommend this place without hesitation.  Oh, and a 12oz draft of Sappporo for less than $2?  Pleasant surprise!",

They don't know from tempura batter to panko.   Ordered tempura and received food that was dipped & fried in panko. We complained to one of the waitress and she said it was the tempura and walked away.   Asked to speak with the manager but got told that he is busy. (Saw an Asian man who seemed like a manager, he had a white baseball cap and a aqua colored polo shirt, walking around and talking to other guests, laughing and socializing.  He should've been told that we wanted to speak to him, if that was the manager).   Anyway, we tell the waitress again that their special, TNT Shrimp is tempura and how our food was breaded in panko was not tempura. We found out that this place is run by Korean owners (which is fine with me) but c'mon, don't even know how to make tempura?  Even if the cook dipped the food in panko in error, waitress should know what their menu should look like. Have eaten here for the past 3 years but we'll be taking our $70 business elsewhere.    Ah-So or Fresh Wasabi (non-Japanese operated) will do..., better yet, Kabuki at Westgate (excellent place, btw) or Sakana for authentic Japanese food. Kampai is an excellent restaurant but on the other side of town (32nd St & Bell).",

I got hungry after the game and I found this conveniently located sushi restaurant not too far from the ballpark. I walked in at around 1:30, but the restaurant was packed!! Who would have imagined a sushi restaurant in AZ in the middle of March would be that packed??  The wait was not too long and the hostess was nice enough to offer a complementary drink to keep myself hydrated. As a big fan of sushi, I have had many different sushi from many different places. But it was a pleasant surprise to find out how good of a quality sushi this place was offering in the middle of a desert.  Then on my way to the bathroom, I found a giant wall filled with photos of ball players and celebrities. I guess this place is like a go-to place for the ball players during the spring training period??  Anyways, the overall food quality was surprisingly good and service was excellent. I will definitely be returning for some more next year!!",

The place was packed, but my friend and I were seated immediately at the sushi bar.  Our drink order was taken within a couple of minutes.  I ordered 2 sets of the spicy yellowtail rolls, since that's my thang.  They came up quick, and they looked great... but that was nothing compared to their taste.  Probably one of the most spiciest spicy yellowtail rolls I've ever had.  A single tear of joy rolled off my cheek.  I offered one to my companion, who asserted that his sushi hymen was indeed intact.  After trying it, he blurted out complements regarding the bite sized treat... so I offered another.  But that's where my hospitality ended.  These were so good, that I bogarted 10 of the 12 rolls.  I'm not sure if the quintuplets were waiting tables that night, but I couldnt discern which waitress was ours, so I reached out to the nearest one and requested our check.  And then we were gone...  Sure beat the hell out of the pedestrian cuisine a la <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FJobbing.com&s=bfe1441615cc124f967e1a2383957929c5e38ed5068cec9824552316a32edcec\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jobbing.com</a> Arena.

Definitely a must try if you've never had it! The entrees were awesome too! If the sushi is above par, then I will give it 5 stars.

I'm a recent fan of sushi (yeah....I know, something's wrong with me) and have been trying different types at various places. This place is one of the good ones! I tried the crunch roll and the teriyaki beef roll. Both were amazing! I got it special ordered since I do not like avocado (not my fault, it's my brothers!) and they were very accommodating. Both were perfect and the portions were huge! I have leftovers (who would guess?) for tomorrow. Can't wait. :) Will recommend this place to others and I will be back again.",

    "text": "My husband and I were looking for a good place to have Friday night date night at, after my haircut. We yelped around and saw this place and decided to check it out. It's a rather standard suburban sushi place in the Arrowhead area. We got there about 8-9 pm that night, and the place was almost empty. Service was prompt and efficient, and we were seated quickly with menus in our hands.  The drink selection was... okay. I got the watermelon martini, which was good, but truthfully nothing to write home about. I ordered some tempura udon, and the shrimp tempura was crispy and fresh, but the broth a bit too high on the sodium content. The sushi rolls we got were nice, but not immensely creative. Well made though, with decent fish. I did ask to order my favorite- ikura nigiri, and they unfortunately didn't have it. I got ebiko nigiri instead, at her suggestion. Not my favorite, but a decent substitute. Fish eggs are fish eggs.   The one noteworthy thing that I did enjoy was that they had a good number of rolls with 'white tuna', or escarole. My husband and I love it. But if you do your research and google it you will know that it doesn't always agree with everyone, especially if eaten in large quantities. So reader beware- you may NOT have a nice reaction to it, and really that differs from individual to individual. Neither myself or my husband have ever had a reaction, and we enjoy eating it every time we see it in on a menu.   Overall- 3.5 stars, rounded down to 3. A nice place, but really, nothing to go out of your way to enjoy.",

My favorite rolls are the J-Tom roll which has the jalepano bomber appetizer inside and spicy albacore on top, the thunder roll (has spicy tuna on top and shrimp tempura inside), and the Heidi roll which has spicy tuna and cilantro (droooool).   Though the Happy Hour doesn't have all the specialty rolls on it, it does have an extensive list of appetizers and popular rolls at an amazing price!  I would recommend this to anyone in the Peoria/Glendale area. Great food and great service!",

With this plate you also get Mi so soup and a small salad.  A bowl of white rice is also included with the meal as well.  They also offer specialty sushi plates, but can get add up if you really want plates of sushi.  Another great offer is the happy hour Sunday-Thursday, 11am to 7pm.  You can get a bucket of bud, Bud light, Kirin, or Kirin light for $10.  Its 5 beers so 2 bucks a pop is not bad.    Overall a great place to enjoy sushi and unwind with family and friends.",

We got the:  Spicy poki (spicy sashimi salad) Kabuki shrimp app. Pink princess roll Loberster roll J-Tom roll Vegas roll Samuri roll and Serenda roll  It was a bit of a splurge, but every bite of everything was simply outstanding.  Our server was also very attentive, pleasant, and had great knowledge of the menu (we had a ton of questions). We will definitely be back soon to cure our sushi cravings.",

Both the Phoenix and Dynamite were amazing - loved the scallops on top of the Dynamite. The Crunch Roll wasn't as crunchy as I'd hoped, but I think that's because we refrigerated the rolls for a few hours before eating them. The hostess who helped me was very friendly. The cost came to about $40 with tip, which isn't terrible for the quality of the sushi. I'll definitely be back.",

I really wish I could remember the names of the things we had. They may come to me before I finish this review (\"Come onnnnnn Red Bull, kick in!). Whenever there's a non-sushi regular, one has to ease them in slowly via the mandatory introductory \"If you're going to actually like anything, it's probably this California Roll\" routine, avoiding squid and things that protrude out at one's face whenever possible. So, the California Roll, like Tennis in that it's easy to get but difficult to master, was actually exquisite! If I remember correctly, the next roll was a Dragon Roll of sorts with eel, cream cheese and some other seafood stuffs locked in there. Again, quite good. The last item was red and and came in an aluminum foil viking ship. It too was quite good. All in all, a nice evening with a good friend, sushi and yes, root beer (for me). I'd go here again for sure.",

I'd of wished that they would have stuck around with me being a first timer so they could answer any questions I may have. Overall I am pleased with this restaurant. They have an extensive selection of sushi that is sure to please any craving. They also offer alternative sushi rolls with meats such as beef and chicken which I could to be nice. I personally had the J-Tom roll and the tempura shrimp appetizer, both of which were delicious. I found this place to have very flavorful sushi. I have tried several places that specialize in sushi but they all serve sushi that is very bland and boring. As a result I have never returned to them. I crave places that have selections such as this place and that make sushi so good that you wish you could make the same thing at home. The sushi I got was among the best I've had. They ingredients all tasted very fresh unlike some places. The albacore tuna was not fishy in the slightest. The jalapeno complimented the crab filling, while the secret spicy sauce and the torch seared sesame topped tuna made the roll explode with flavor. I will for sure be returning here as I left there wanting for more. Skip your trip to get sushi anywhere but here. I promise the flavor won't let you down.",
