Actually my only complaint was the water was horrible,  tasted very metallic. Other then that, had a great time.  The pretzels app was great too!",

    "text": "Fibber's has always been a decent go-to Irish pub.  Good service, good beer and liquor selection and a decent menu.  The Happy Hour specials are pretty solid as well.  I've noticed over the past year or so that while they've continued to provide a good selection of beers and booze, they food side of things has declined a bit.  A good example would be the \"Reuben Bar\".  I think it's cool you can pick your bread, (Marble Rye, Multigrain or sourdough), meat (Pastrami, corned beef or turkey), then your choice of slaw or kraut as a garnish. Over the last two weeks, they've been out of various bread options and when the sandwich arrives, it's skinny...my last one probably had two, maybe three slices of pastrami on it, but pretty darn thin, with a sprinkling of kraut.  Tasted good, but for $10 I guess I expect a heartier sandwich.  You can order extra meet for $2, but that would probably get it just about to the point of the normal amount of meat I would expect on a sandwich at that cost.  Not sure why the side salad in place of fries is a $1 more, given the cost of lettuce. For a $1 more I could have ordered the meatloaf dinner that comes with fresh green beans and mashed potatoes. Seems like a much better value.  Service is pretty good overall and I'm sure the servers probably aren't too thrilled with the trivia night crowd on Tuesdays as they don't seem to buy a lot of beer or booze.  Will I continue to go for trivia night on Tuesdays? Yes.  Given the choice of Fibbers, Casey's or Rula, Fibbers would not be my first choice.",

    "text": "The atmosphere at Fibber Magees is the first thing you notice walking in. Open the door and, if you're there at the right time and day, you're bound to be hit in the ears with live music. The performer (I, unfortunately, did not catch her name) is wonderfully talented. She attempted doing an operatic  piece while I was there the second time and succeeded in spades.   I like their selection of beers and ciders and they have plenty of them on draft. They also have their fair share of good ones not on tap. Having grown up without being able to experience Guinness it's still a novelty for me, but not a favorite. They also have some concoctions like the Snakebite which is half cider and half ale which is not half bad.  Now for the food. The food. Let me preface this by saying I have this thing for garlic. So when I saw fries with garlic sauce on the side, I ordered it immediately. I will now proceed to spend the next fifteen months trying to figure out how to make it. The curry they have on the side with one of their fries is also very good and I suspect it's even better over rice. Their flatbread is exceptional and is something I'm dying to go back and nom on again.  I have two minor complaints, neither of which detracted from my experience. First, the man taking our orders seemed to be spread very thin and was having a hard time getting around making sure everything was filled. On my second visit, that was not an issue, but I made the poor choice of sitting right in front of the singer while she was performing, but that was an oversight on my part.  I should also note that they have a back room with four TV screens playing sports, they have a pool table and darts in back as well as a patio where, presumably you can smoke (assuming we haven't banned that in bars in Arizona). Specials are listed on their website and $3.25 for beers on Sunday? I'll be right there.  This being the case, I'm going back. I love the atmosphere, I love the decor and I love the food. I'd say this is the kind of place you bring a couple friends to kick back a few beers with and just have a good time.",

On weekends, I sleep in and visit Fibber Magees around mid day for breakfast to watch some game or have my quiet time and hearty breakfast. I love their traditional Irish breakfast that goes well with Irish coffee. The breakfast  comes with 3 kinds of sausages and a Bacon, beans or mashed potatoes, grilled tomatoes with some type of great tasting traditional bread.  This week, he said he has improved his Irish coffee recipe and showing it off to everyone while he scored to more orders from the girls who were watching. Apparently, there are two versions - The guys' version has floated heavy cream (very slightly whipped) and girls version has fully whipped cream (like Reddi Whip).  I think Brian added some Irish mist on top.

They were almost 1/2 a chicken breast and fried in the same batter you would normally see for the fish of fish and chips.  The burgers looked great and those that ordered them said they tasted just as good as they looked.  The lamb skewers, served with a small salad, were perfect for a light lunch.  I have also been to FIbber's a few times later in the night and have always had a good time.  Live music, real dart board, good drinks and good people.

This place is the sister bar to The Skeptical Chymist, but they have different menus. Skeptical Chymist is closer to me but I'd rather drive the 45 min it takes to get to Fibber Magees. They don't have the same menus, which is disappointing.   Without a doubt, you must order the lamb nachos. My favorite, by far, and I always order them. Instead of tortilla chips, the dish comes with lightly fried wonton wrappers, ground lamb, feta cheese, and pico de gallo. The portions are very nice; even when sharing the dish with my husband, it's a lot.   Every day, they have various specials, \"dine in\" only. My husband loves the $5 burgers on Mondays. They're not skimpy, but nice and meaty. He always cuts it in half bc it is so filling. We've also come in and had their sliders. Those were also very yummy.   Their chicken tenders aren't heavily breaded, but are still fried. I really like those! I have yet to find a place with better chicken tenders. The fish in their fish 'n chips was huge and filling. If you've got a hankering for fish, this will take care of it.",

The American breakfast and service were great, Bryan and Emma were very welcoming. I saw reviews referring to it being a dive bar, which it is not. I will be trying the Irish breakfast next time in the recommendation of Bryan. Definitely worth a visit.",

The secondary room is barren and super creepy, the bathroom is regularly wet and gross, and it's not in the fanciest locale.  I paid what I consider to be an outrageous amount for a Fibbers salad, which had spring mix, flimsy cold precooked bacon bits, and flavorless unseasoned boiled chicken breast dumped on it. I wish I had taken a photo- this chicken was grey-white all the way through. My poor waitress did what she could to dress it up with sliced tomatoes, but it was clear she didn't have much to work with. If I pay $12 for a salad, I certainly expect more than this. I've eaten other food here and been reasonably pleased, if not still a bit irked by sticker shock. Clearly they can get away with these prices either because the patrons are drunk or due simply to a lack of competition in the area.  I expected much more and was sorely disappointed with my meal. If you must go, get a meat dish or sandwich, and prepare to pay more than you should. It will at least taste good.  Ps- I was comfortable paying $4 for a side of fries only because they actually make an effort with these. It is the one thing I can honestly recommend is worth the price.",

We had:  Tempura Beans (Irish?), Dirty Nellies, Fish & Chips, Shepherd's Pie, and a Rasher Burger all washed down by Smithwicks, BlackSmith & a Grimbergen Blond.  All super good Irish pub food - -  with the exception of the Tempura Beans (which were excellent, but Irish?). We could have been sitting in that magical transported Irish Pub.  Ambiance was Irish pub; service was sweet Irish lass friendly and right on top of our needs.   Then . . . we had to step back out into a warm Arizona spring day. Lovely here, but I'd rather be in an Irish Pub.  P.S. Fibber Magees has All-U-Can-Eat Fish & Chips every Friday!",

Don't eat here unless you like overpriced food.  Oh, and asking customers to share tables is extra tacky.  And by the way, waitresses are supposed to ask if you need refills...

I've been to FGs when they had parties going on (including St. Patrick's Day) as well as just to get lunch.  It really isn't my thing in either case. If you just want to have more of an Irish time sitting around talking to friends and drinking G, then this is your place.  Still a nice place and food is generally alawys good to me.  St. Patricks is a clusterfuck. Craziness. Fun. Just remember that if you go for this event, don't drive. Don't even drive if you've only had one beer 5 hours ago. Police will sit around FGs and pull you over, pull everyone over, that comes out of that place. I got hauled in for a DUI after the cop said that I made an improper left turn (how convenient of him to make that up so he could pull me over). Luckily I had stopped drinking hours and hours before leaving so I was way under the limit and the case got thrown out.",

Then you will start looking over their great beer, whiskey and scotch selections (although why you would order anything other than Guinness and Paddys is beyond me) and be amazed.

It does feel a lot like an Irish pub and I would even say that the atmosphere is better than some of the other places that I've been to that were similar. Other than that the dining experience was just okay for me. I was really looking forward to getting the fish & chips here before arriving which I did manage to get, however I have to say that I was rather disappointed with it. The chips (fries) were not very good at all and based on that I will not get this again. At least the fish was pretty good however the outside texture was too crispy in my opinion and I've still had better at other places. They also forgot my utensils when the food came which I don't mind that much as they brought them before I even asked.  The atmosphere here is awesome but I'm not too sure if I'll come back here other than maybe the happy hour deals that they have throughout the week.",

This is an Irish bar, with authentic Irish decor, Irish food and beer of course. When we walked in, my husband noticed the music playing was alternative, and wanted Irish music, so our waitress had the bartender changed it to Irish music, it added to the Irish feel. After studying the menu, I decided on the Fish and Chips. All I can say is HOLY COW the 2 pieces of fish I got were humongous, along with the HUGE pile of fries, with what I would say homemade tarter sauce. I dug into the fish, which was some of the best fish I've had in a long time. The batter was smooth and had an excellent flavor. The fish was cooked perfectly, they brought a bottle of malt vinegar to go on your fish as well. The fries were ok. Not the greatest. But, not bad either. I still cannot believe I ate it all, it was my lunch and supper all in one meal. If we didn't have an afternoon event to go to I would have asked for a doggie bag. Our waitress was attentive, and told us if we liked the Fish and Chips that on Friday's it is all you can eat. So, needless to say, we will be back on a Friday night for the all you can eat fish and chips.",

Since then the pub has taken on a new dimension as they now caiter to Seahawks gamedays.   On the inside, Fibber has a woodcrafted look with corners, booths, and tables situated here and there. The main bar is in the back while the front side has extra seating. There's also an outdoor patio with an HDTV and lots of cigarette smokers. The feel is definitely Irish pub meets Seahawks bar.  Seahawks gamedays are put on by the Arizona Seahawkers, which means any Hawks gameday requires you show up at least an hour early if you want a good seat. This place must make some serious cash on Hawks games. The fatal flaw about Fibber lies with the woodcrafted look, there's pillars and frames which block out the projector and some of the TVs from seats at an angle.  As for the food, there's not too much I haven't liked here. The Irish burger is tasty, as is the cone of garlic/rosemary fries, and meatloaf sandwich. Their potato leak soup is a little on the cream-of-wheat side and their chili is what I would imagine Irish chili to be. Their chicken strips are beastly, fish and chip breaded style breasts. The scalloped potatoes are worth the extra $1. The BBQ pork sliders looked all right from what I saw. Kind of a mix of bar food and Irish classics. The lamb shepards pie is worth the $10 if you're hungry.",

We went there today and the menu had changed, removing a couple of my favorite items, which was disappointing. We ordered a new item for an appetizer, the Brussels sprouts and were thoroughly disappointed. They were definitely nowhere close to \"pan roasted\" as described, were terribly underseasoned and undercooked. My husband ordered another new menu item as a meal, the 4 cheese and spinach flatbread. He was unimpressed, but did eat it. I ordered the peppercorn burger with potato crisps. The burger did not have the peppercorn sauce or onion strips as advertised, but was flavorful and cooked as ordered. Instead of potato crisps, which I was weirdly really excited about, I got champ. It was mediocre at best, and again, disappointing because I really wanted the crisps (needed some salty crunch). We have never had this type of experience at Fibbers, and were really upset about how it turned out. We love the staff, the love music, and the happy hour deals. However, the menu change is a huge bummer, as was the complete disregard for our correct order tonight. Might need to find a new watering hole!  :(",

I did enjoy the band that was featured for the evening, The Big Fellas, but it was a bit loud making it difficult for conversation.",

Straight out those were cold and weird. I wouldn't order again and I ate them, but only because I was starving.  The fish & chips were pretty good. The fish was delicious, flavorful (I guess for fish), and flaky. The french fires were good, not the best french fries ever, but good. We would definitely go back and this visit was better than we remember it all those years ago!",

    "text": "Very disappointed with our recent experience at Fibber McGee's; it was the exact opposite of our first experience. The waitress, from the moment we walked in was inattentive, rude and seemed resentful. No greeting at all other than \"sit wherever you want\". After we seated ourselves it took at least 15 minutes for her to come by so we could ask for menus, she went to get them then tossed them on the table without a word. Another long wait and she finally came back for the order which we placed and then asked her for drink menus. Getting 2 beers took another 10 or 15 minutes. When she brought our meals she just quickly dropped them at the table then turned around and walked off. We waited about 10 minutes before we saw her again so we could ask for utensils and napkins. It was about 10 more minutes before she brought those and tossed them on the table. It was a weeknight, not very busy when we went and we made no special requests (other than asking for menus and utensils) so I can't understand why service was so incredibly slow. I have no idea what her problem or why she exhibited such a bad attitude but it definitely left a negative impression and we haven't been back since.  It's really too bad that a waitress' attitude can make what previously had been a great experience turn into something negative. Our first experience at Fibber McGee's had been very positive and I really want to like this place...maybe sometime we'll give it another try to see what the best two out of three brings.",

Some of the best bartenders around- Clayton, Will (who's not there anymore, but dammit he should be), Scott, the list goes on. None of them are any less than stellar. And the atmosphere is as close to what I think of as a real Irish pub as I've ever found.   I know what you're thinking- wooden floors, Guinness and an Irish sounding name, and you've got yourself an \"authentic\" Pub. Nay nay- I looked into it, and one of the bar's owners is from Ireland directly. It's a PUBlic house, meaning yes, you can bring the kids, and nobody's getting offended. Everyone's just getting well fed and having a great time.   Now let's talk about the amenities people- all drink and no play makes Joe a sad boy. At Fibber's, the games abound. They have 2 pool tables, a few arcade games in the back (Buck Hunter and Golden Tee), 3 dart boards, live music all the time (including a Sunday Afternoon Irish Jam), and multiple large flatscreens so you can catch the game, too. This place is almost always a great time, and when it's not, it's because everyone's recovering from the night before. If you want to come and chill out, have a cold one and not be in a meat market on a Friday night, look no further.   Also, they have some of the very best food I've ever eaten in a bar. One word- BURGERS. Before I went vegan, this was the Mecca, the Holy Grail, the Eden of hamburgers. But their flatbreads, their fries, their salads- everything on this menu is amazing. Don't miss the Fish and Chips- make a night of it. Hot wings rule here, too. Oh yes, and they have CHAMP. If you don't know what it is, Google it, order it, eat, repeat.   Fibbers, please oh please move to Portland. Marquam Hill specifically. Until you do, Arizona- you better treat them nice.",

The second time was a Friday night and the food was decent, but it wasn't the same.  My husband ordered the corned beef.  I tried and it was decent.

Enjoyed a few Harp's and of course Guinness is on the menu. Waitress was really lacking in service - asked for waters several times, had to chase her down for beers, offered us more fish before we even started on the first.  We stuck around to hear the band. They were a kick and could actually sing some non-Irish songs! Had some fun and got some good people watching time in (this was just prior to St Paddy's day).  Place is dark and run down inside. Looks like some folks use this as their starter bar. I can't fathom going there again myself - bar, food or otherwise.",

I used to get the bangers & mash every time I visited, but the past few times my most recent time I went with fish & chips - one of my favorites. I didn't see the bangers on the menu this time, so it may have been changed. The full Irish Breakfast is exactly like I had back at the Tyrrellspass Castle Restaurant on my way to Galway, Ireland.

I started off with pulled pork sliders for an appetizer. I shared them with my wife. They were tender, smoky, and juicy. This was a good indicator of the pulled pork sandwich they offer. For the entree  I decided to try the Belfast burger. This was one of the best burgers I've had. It is a 1/2 pound burger on a brioche bun topped with lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions, roasted red pepper, mushrooms, garlic sauce, an onion ring, and your choice of cheese.(I chose pepper jack) The burger was grilled to a medium well which was my specification. The burger was full of flavor, juicy, and very filling. Almost makes me wish I had not ordered the sliders. I couldn't finish the fries that came with the burger. I also had two Guinness nitro IPA beers. They had happy hour so all appetizers and tap beer was 50%off. I was asked about dessert, but there was no room left. I will be back here later this month for a graduation party.",

I want to say how much I appreciated the staff at Fibber Magees for providing a meal for 12 that I was able to pick up that very busy morning of March 17th. They could have said no, which is what every other Irish pub said. They could have been rude and dismissive due to our team's procrastination, but they were gracious and accommodating, and actually pulled it off for us. Made me look like a hero to my people, so THANKS to the whole staff at Fibber Magees. We ordered the traditional corned beef and cabbage meal for 12 people, which was well-enjoyed and hastily consumed.  Go raibh maith agat!!",

Hopefully if the manager is reading this review - please ask the man who just attended my call ( On Sep 12, 1.28pm) to be less rude to the customers. God such negative energy this guy has created.

Pretty pathetic for a restaurant to not notice it was running out of something but even more pathetic it didn't go to the grocery store and buy some so they can get through the afternoon.  DO NOT ORDER THE GARLIC FRIES!!  THEY SUCK!  Extremely salty to the point you can only eat one or two and then you are done.  Alex, the bartender, really didn't do much to make the experience any better or at least take the fries off my check.  Speaking of Alex - how long does it take to pour a Guinness?  HOLY CRAP!!!  When I am the only customer at the bar needing a drink, I should not have to wait 10 minutes for a pint of Guinness.  Completely unacceptable.  The reuben, Guinness, and the live Irish music were good but in general, there are much better places than Fibber Magees.",

I had to hold in my gagging reflex. I stayed only because I was meeting someone there and like I said, wanted my Asian nachos. Of course, the smell continued and I held my breath while I walked in I rushed to the bathroom and thank god, the bathroom smelled better than the restaurant. And to make everything worse, you removed Asian nachos from your menu!!!! That was the most creative, inventive thing you had on the menu!!! Ok, so not going back.

The mac and cheese at $11 is super tasty but again, the portion is small for what you pay..if that's all you order you will leave hungry.  Same for the Asian salad at $12...the portion was pitifully small for $12...seriously, how much does lettuce cost (my friend subbed lettuce for the cabbage) that they couldn't use enough to make it a meal size serving?  So basically come in for happy hour if you want to eat.  Service has always been decent.  There are only a couple booths in the place so hope you don't mind hard chairs.  The main section is warm and cozy with wood everywhere but the side room is dingy and has an old basement smell.  All in all glad we found this place.",

    "text": "Irish pubs can be hit or miss, even in Ireland, but especially in the New World. There are plenty of schmucks with green carpet and a shamrock in the window, but few of these places are truly legitimate drink houses.   Inconspicuously tucked into a strip mall in Chandler, Fibber Magee's looks from the parking lot like one of the former. But once you get past the generic exterior, you're highly rewarded with one of the most Irish, wood-paneled, attention-to-detail environments this side of Boston. It's not so much a bar as an actual pub-- a cozy, comfortable establishment where you can also drink cheaply during soccer games, hear a song or two, or generally just get shitfaced. We happened to show up during Monday Night Football, and though the bartender and some patrons were vocally at odds with their rooting interests, everything was kept relatively civil throughout the evening. Though Irish-Americans aren't especially known for their cuisine, the easy-on-the-eyes waitress served up some of the finest corned beef boxty going. The meat was lean and tender, and the whole thing was complemented by a heaven-sent mustard-based sauce. It's a knockout. Eat it. There are plenty of whiskies too, if that's your thing, and if you're here, it may as well be your thing.  All in all, there's not much to complain about. Good food, good drink, comfortable and relatively authentic atmosphere... Fibber Magee's is a total standout. Cheers!",

I put the blue cheese on the side so I could have a chance to actually taste the steak only to discover there is a reason there is an over-poweringly flavored spread on the sammy.  Then the fries were soggy and gross.  The chicken tenders were good, battered with their fish and chip batter and the mustard they came with was delicious, but $10 for a chicken tender appetizer.... ouch.  The bread pudding was good, but the one at Famous Dave's is way better, and really, a BBQ joint beating out an Irish pub in the race for the best bread pudding? WTF.  So I guess what Im saying, is if you plan on dinning at Fibber's, skip the menu, get the fish and chips and just get hammered on the patio.  Under no circumstance, order a to-go dinner of much anything else on the menu. Also, I must throw in, I do go here quite a bit, and the wait staff, the music and the people always rock and I always have a good time.  Love the bar staff, love the tap choices, I'll just eat before I go.",

I suggested the traditional Irish breakfast and she agreed. What I didn't tell her is that it includes blood sausage. The wait time for the meal was good and it looked like an Irish breakfast.  I had her try the sausage (which comes in white and black, without blood and with) and she gave me a funny look. Not that it was bad , but it didn't taste how it looked. They put nutmeg or something along that line in it. I could not put my finger on it , but it was different. We also had some shepards pie, which was pretty good. With the wooden decor and the choices of alcohol it is a good place to relax and hang for a while.",

The fish and chips are fantastic and so are the garlic mushrooms.  Clayton the bartender is the bomb!",

Sure, it's in Chandler which is not the most happening place around Phoenix, but there sure are plenty of people who live in Chandler that love to go out!  It's about the best place to hang out in Chandler!  The crowd is somewhat monochromatic, but that's what one must expect from an Irish pub.  I spent New Year's Eve here two years ago, and I loved it!  The price included all-you-can-eat and all-you-can-drink for less than $100 per person!  It also included noisemakers, hats, live music and dancing!  So much fun!  This places shares a parking lot with Filiberto's Mexican food, in case you want to stop for a late night snack after the bar closes.",

The place is really poppin' when the Brazen Heads play, for example, and I don't see all the depressed and downcast people mentioned in one of the earlier reviews.  I don't really get the thing about folks of different ethnicities being treated poorly at Fibber's.  I've been there with black guys and Indian guys, and none of the servers seemed to give a damn about their skin color.  They just poured the beer and collected the money.

The service has been consistently good so far, the beer cold and the food tasty.  I've been ordering the fish and chips, which has been mostly good.  The batter on the fish comes out nice and crisp, but can turn a little soggy if it sits on the plate too long.  Even a little soggy it was still edible, but you might eat the fish first to avoid this situation. My only other knock with the fish was that it was extremely greasy, but what else can you expect with fried foods?  The chips are pretty good, but nothing special.  Just your basic shoestring french fries.  While not perfect, the fish and chips was still quite tasty and as long as your not afraid of a little grease you'll probably enjoy them. The drinks were cold and my server made sure that I never ran dry.    Tip: Go for the lunch portion if you can.  The lunch portion is big enough, and the dinner portions tend to be a little pricey for bar food.",

I remember a bunch of years back they had boxtys on the menu but that is no longer something you can get here. Bummer! I usually end up getting the Shepherd's Pie and they give you a lot of bang for your buck so I walk out of here quite stuffed. Shepherd's Pie is pretty good - sometimes a bit on the salty side - sorta unpredictable. The Irish brown bread that comes with it is awesome though. Who knew that a few slices of bread with butter on it can bring such joy?? Beer selection is pretty decent - changes from week to week. Fridays usually there's a band playing. Keltic Cowboys are good. One night was trivia night. Another night was ska night which was cool until a brawl broke out. I think that might have soured some of us on this place because we haven't been back since. But I'm sure I'll be back someday. Closest Irish pub to where I live. Lotsa parking as it's in a mall.",

    "text": "My husband and I really used to love this place for a nearby, walking distance mini date night...  but I feel the bar part of it has really gone downhill over the last year or 2. Yes, the atmosphere is great-- a dimly lit Irish Pub . The food I've had is decent too. The drinks on the other hand, are over priced and badly made . I should clarify that I'm not a huge drinker, just like to go out once in a while for a couple of drinks while shooting some pool or throwing some darts. But when you pay anywhere from $6-7 for a mix drink, and you can't even taste the alcohol, that is a rip off, pure and simple. And also, good luck getting a consistent price. I went there one night with a friend from out of town, and we had 3 drink each, the same drink every time. the first round was $13, the second round was $12 (hardly tasting the rum in either) , the next round was happy hour so it was a bit less, but then it tasted like pure mixer with literally 0 alcohol. And yes, we tipped well, regardless, so it shouldn't have been a retaliatory thing.  We resolved that since we like the atmosphere and that it is nearby, we would just get beer from now on... Then they raised the price on draft beers too... I feel like they are relying on their well known name and loyalty from people who want a decent place to come to, but they'd  probably get more quantity of business if they focused on quality. We definitely come here less often lately.",

At the time I thought it was good, very crowded and fun atmosphere.  As I was facing a white wall during most of the somewhat uncomfortable evening (ie My brother's friends, my Grandma and lots of booze), I barely noticed all the beautiful woodwork in the main bar area. I have been there twice this week.  Once for a nightcap and a second time for take out.  Both were very enjoyable. The nightcap was after midnight and a few stragglers were ramped up and kinda vocal, but otherwise a friendly and warm atmosphere.  I minded my own business and discovered a drawing application I my phone which kept me entertained.  The Vodka soda was fine with fresh lime.  Bartender was friendly and did not try to rush anyone out- it was getting late and yet he was still relaxed and attentive. Today i picked up a turkey avacado sandwhich and it was great!  Thinly sliced Turkey w/ sliced avacado and Bacon on a nice roll.  Some tomatoes and lettuce and it was perfect.   I recommend checking this place out for both the food and the casual atmosphere.",

I am obsessed with their dirty Nellie's, pretzels and flat breads.   My favorite beer is the snake bite which has a good kick to it and goes straight to your head. Fridays are all you can eat fish and chips with a side of coleslaw and tartar sauce for $14, totally worth it when you have an appetite. Live music is also available in friday nights and Saturday nights.  The environment is welcoming and staff is friendly.",

Love the atmosphere, food, beer choices and Irish music not to forget live Irish Music from 4p to 6p on Sun. Now they have trivia on Mon too. Been going to Fibber's for over 12 years especially for Soccer and friendly, welcoming staff. If you happen to be there when the bartender is Dave, Alex or Kendra are there its a A+ and its even better. Thanks Dave, Alex and Kendra as always for treating us like Fibber family and welcoming us.  (Miss seeing Matt since he is at Skeptical Chemist (their Sister Bar) also Vanessa and Tony.  I like food choicea from Dirty Nellies to Shepherds Pie and Lamb Nachos topped with Jalapenos not to forget Mussels and Belfast burger. I can eat Irish breakfast anytime along with delicious dessert of Chocolate cake with ice cream. Don't forget to visit on St Patrick's Day and countdown clock is in there to give you some planning time.",

There was a fun band playing some type of something that really added to the pub feel.   They offer some good beer on tap, particularly a Scottish one. Our friends recommended the burgers, so I ordered the peppercorn burger with a fried egg on it. I have never had a burger with an egg on it... turned out to be a great idea! The burger was cooked perfectly to what I wanted and the service was good.   Side note: this is a seahawks bar! More brownie points. Haha.   Really laid back bar to come for a good burger and beer. If you aren't a fan of the loud music, there is another room that tones it down a bit and let's you talk to your party without yelling. Great find!",

Imagine a restaurateur with a mechanics outlook on life. He said that they didn't charge us for the raw chicken but we will pay this bill as is and slammed the check on the table.

We were greeted as if we were an inconvenience and it went downhill from there. We ordered poutine to share and were holding on to our menus to decide what else we wanted. I was still looking at my menu when the server abruptly took my son's off the table without even asking. I ordered a beer 3/4 Guinness 1/4 Cider and got mostly cider. When I tried to say something to her, she walked away. After 5-10 minutes, I went to the bar and ordered it myself. I normally tip very well (start at 30% and go up or down based on service).

We sat ourselves and waited for a little while for someone to walk in and take our order. Finally the lady working, Amanda, walked in from her smoke break and helped us. She took our order and then proceeded to sit at the bar with the 1-2 people over there. We ordered an appetizer and food. Unfortunately the appetizer didn't come out fresh (even though it had been sitting in the window ready to go for a while. I could've gotten up and got it if she didn't want to. We then got our food immediately after. The meals were hot thankfully, but the appetizer definitely wasn't. Very disappointed. She didn't check on us at all from that point on. Later we saw her walking into the kitchen behind her boss flipping him off. Extremely unprofessional. She then started to walk out with a cigarette in hand without checking on us. I had to flag her down to get our check and immediately gave her my card without looking at the receipt because I was afraid we'd never get it taken care of if we let her go on break. Very, very disappointed. Only positive was the food. Might be back.",

I was really looking forward to the Irish breakfast but it's way overpriced and not great.  It was initially served cold. Both my friend and I sent ours back.  The second attempt was better, but the bacon was awful. Tough (presumably reheated), with a weird taste of cloves. Honestly never had Irish/English/Danish bacon close to that bad.  $14.49 for the breakfast. Not even Irish tea - they have Stash brand, which is decent for American, but not the real thing.  They also employ alternate math: They have a breakfast for $8.99. The blurb says it's half the size of the Full Irish. It comes with one sausage. So the Full Irish should have 2, right? Actually not right. It also has one.  Very nice server. Very defensive manager/co-owner.  As I said, I'll be back for Spurs. Done with eating food there though. Overpriced and not worth it.",

She is constantly touching her finger talking about what her wedding ring looked like before the divorce, he was staring at her chest.

Best Guinness on tap (they know how to pour), yummy food, good prices, great staff and cool atmosphere. I've never been out of the country, but I get a True Irish pub feeling going here. Very welcoming and kind of feel like family.  Will definitely visit more often!",

    "text": "What a mixed bag for me.  I used to love this place, I really did.  There was a time when a group of my friends considered Fibbers to be their seccond home - and we were here at least two or three times a month.  (Some are there almost daily - I would only make the trek a couple times a month.)  The drinks were poured well and reasonably priced, the food was tasty and the music was great.  Real craic in that room!  Not sure what happened over the past couple of years - but WOW, last night was hit and miss across the board.  A group of us met to bid farewell to a friend moving out of state.  The drinks are still solid (they have REAL ginger ale, which is getting more and more rare with many bars opting to mix coke and sprite for the right color - flavor be damned.)  The food was pretty spot on, too - though I am not thrilled with some of the menu changes and don't get others.  (Gone are the fried mushooms - which were fantastic.  For an Irish Pub - why the section of Medditerannean flatbread pizza??  The items I saw were well presented - but along with the \"upgrade\" to the menu, some of the local pub flavor has been lost.)  I had the fish and chips.  With the size of the cod filet that showed up, it's a damn good thing I was sharing with another gal - that sucker was HUGE!  The beer batter was flavorful and fried to crispy golden perfection - the cod was still moist and tasty - a truly enjoyable dish.  It was on a bed of fries - somewhat thicker than shoestring, but thinner than normal - skin on and well cooked.  The coleslaw was OK - seemed commercial grade - but nothing wrong with it.    So - why only three stars?  Service and music.   Our server was adorabe.  Cute, sweet, friendly and great smile.  And damn near totally inept.  There were five of us at our table.  With the first round of drinks, three of us asked for water in addition to our libations.  None of us got them.  So we asked again when the food was dropped off.  Nothing.  The party next to us had some styro cups and an almost empty pitcher of water.  I grabbed the cups, filled what I could, and took the pitcher to the bar to get refilled.  When we wanted a fresh round of drinks, it took over 20 minutes of empty dinner plates and empty cocktail and beer glasses before she came around. No pre-bussing was done as plated were emptied - and when she did come by to grab dishes, she looked so focused and didn't make eye contact that without grabbing her, it would have been impossible to ask for more drinks.  The disturbing part was when I ordered an Irish Coffee (yes, I am aware that Irish Coffee is not from Ireland - it's from San Francisco - but in this day and age, ordering Irish Coffee at an Irish pub just makes good sense.)  The look I got from our waitress was a combo of deer in the headlights, confused, and \"what language did you just say that in?\" Happily, the bartender knows just what it is, and I received a good one - but the look she gave when I asked for it was more than a little unsettling.  And noted by the people around me, as well. At the end of the night, I had to search the bar to find her to get my tab. I guess that's the irony of of the automatic 18% gratuity for groups.  She doesn't actually have to WORK to make the money.  Why should she?  Do a half assed job and get 18%, or truly work and do a good job and maybe get another 4 or 5% on average?  So - it's there to ensure she doesn't get stiffed, but it also doesn't provide any reason for her to do a decent job.  Sigh.  The band was really, really bad.  They used to bring in local bands with Irish flavor - who were GOOD.  The band last night (and from conversation with regulars, most of the bands of late) could not be classified as good.  But, what they lacked in talent they more than made up for in volume.  The best part of the show was when they took breaks.  Sure - it may not be fair to take a star away from the establishment based on my feelings toward the band - but it was impossible to overlook.  If that's the caliber of bands Fibbers is bringing in on weekends now, I think I know what I will have to do in the future. #1 - only show up during the week and #2 - sit at the bar. Hopefully when Clayton in there - as he knows just what he's doing and has the charm and personality that keeps me feeling like a valued customer.",

My wife & daughter ordered the Potato Leek soup with side salad and Brown bread - that  is their favorite dish - light eaters.  I chose the Lamb Shepherds pie which I have ordered  on previous visits and has been very good.  Tonight it was on the soupy side so our server Amanda took it back and a Peppercorn burger was ordered.  Burger was good-not great.  Served with a pile of fries which were very good.  We also sampled the Pretzel bread which is very good and comes with (2) dipping sauces - cheesy and horseradish mustard, both of which are excellent.  Amanda was very attentive to our needs and even offered a dessert for the wait on my dinner.  We were too full to take her up on that but they have very good desserts.  Thanks Amanda for taking good care of us!!!  Brazen Heads are worth the trip, True showmen!",

    "text": "This place is hands-down one cool place to hang. From hardwood floors to wooden barrels as mini-bars, you can't go wrong here. If you're with a group, you have options - tables near the music or wooden benches tucked in the back corner, just right of the entrance. Or, if you're with just one or two, you can take up a spot near the dart board and pool table - sort of your own little playground. Or, for those of us who like saddling up to the bar, you have that choice, too.   There's no smoking inside, thankfully. When you used to be able to light up, the place filled up fast with smoke. It was an asthmatic's worst nightmare.  The bartenders are exceptionally nice and attentive. The music is generally some of the best you'll hear around the Valley. Especially when they bring in their staple Irish bands. (I've heard some of the best Irish music here!)  Fibber's was the first Irish Pub I visited when I moved here. It was a Thursday night. The pub was active, but not overwhelmingly so. My friend and I were able to entertain ourselves with a few games of pool and darts. Then the music started. It was great. The atmosphere was causal, friendly and you could tell people here were regulars.   I recommend this place to anyone in the area, or anyone itching to try a new place. It's easy to find, off Elliot Rd, (just east of the 101) in a plaza. You walk inside and the lighting is dim, the wood floors and benches add something unique to the setting. If you fancy the band, you can sit close. Or if you want some privacy, snatch up a corner spot.",

I'm not much of a drinker, I do know the Irish drink more than just Guinness and Jameson. They really like Coors light over there...lol. Just because a place throws a old bike on the wall and plasters Guinness stuff around doesn't make it Irish.  Fibber's better look and feel, the menu  selections are great. they have Brown sauce!  The service was really bad.  They need to hire more wait staff.  the garlic fire sauce was spot on! The burger was one of the best I've had in a very long time. They put Irish bacon too! I'd give it five stars but the service stunk...too to long to get your order.",

Low key place that is set up to look like a library, killer beer selection, live music most nights of the week, and some of the best garlic fries around. Fries seem simple, I know, but trust me on this. They use some sort of parsley aioli, and I'm certain the secret ingredient is sorcery. Get them and a local brew, and settle in for the live music.  Also, this is a Seahawks bar and even if you're not a fan, this is a great place to watch NFL games!",

We've worked our way through most of the menu, but I couldn't believe we had not tried either one of those items and they looked fantastic!     We stopped in this past Saturday and I ordered the bangers and colcannon ($11.99) and my husband ordered the rasher burger ($11.49) which is one of our favorite burgers anywhere.  I had an AB InBev Four Peaks white ale for only 4 bucks, and he had one of the mules which are $6.50 on Saturdays.  Overall, the food and drinks were 5 stars.  The service on the other hand...well let's just say it was an off day.  There were 2 women working the bar area and they were more concerned with talking and staring at some list on a clipboard than taking care of customers.  I had to give one of them the stare down to get their attention more than once, and surprisingly it wasn't that busy for a Saturday evening.   Every place can have an off night though, and thankfully the food was great.  We'll be back to try that shepherd's pie!",

    "text": "\"Laughter is the brightest where food is the best.\"  Irish Proverb  Ah, a Chandler staple stince 2003 and one of the best place to get some Irish fair.  They usually host a crazy party during St. Patrick's Day filled with Guinness, live bands, and all that funk for an entry fee.  They're located in the United Blood Service plaza that houses a cigar bar, a Subway, and a marijuana dispensary.  It's all wooden and kitschy inside with Irish music playing in the background.  But wait, actual lamb in Shepherd's Pie? Excellent!  I hate it when people advertise their cottage pie as a shepherd's pie and then you get a plate with minced beef and not lamb.  It's the worst and makes me rage.  The shepherd's pie here at Fibber's is pretty dang amazing.  The potatoes are insanely rich and creamy.  Like, you can feel your arteries clogging as you eat this by the forkful.  Don't worry though, just wash it all down with a Half & Half [I'm not talking cream, folks].  I do enjoy their pretzel sticks appetizers when it's hot from the kitchen.  Let it cool and they become boulders.  The Bangers & Colcannon are pretty good as well.  The mash potatoes have kale in it and has a mushroom onion gravy on top.    Stop in if you're craving Irish food!  To be noted, this place is Seattle Seahawks friendly.  Marc M. and Flash would be comfortable here.",

The atmosphere is much more authentic of pubs back in Ireland than most faux \"Irish\" strip mall places you'll find, very homey, clean and comfortable.

None of us in a rush, most people ended up just getting drinks as waitress made ordering as difficult as possible. We took our seats, no one helped us out as seat yourself, but as soon as we do, complain to us about taking up too much room??. Place was empty except 2 people at bar when we got there at 6:30.  Waitress came by, no hello or anything, \"Anyone ordering food?\". I said yes, but menu please. She pointed to the other end of the table and said, \"IT\" (i.e. the one menu for 16 people) \"is over there\". What a Jerk!  And, here it comes, after waiting about 30 minutes after being served and no refills, someone asked for check, she starts in \"Umm, I hope you guys don't think I'm going to break this up!?\".  I turned my chair around and said, \"Why are you so upset at us... why are you screaming at us?\".  Suddenly the attitude stopped and she seemed nervous.   Really strange.  So the bill was a big mess, but we all figured it out.  The food, what she actually let us order, was fantastic.  IF YOU HAVE A GROUP OVER 4 PEOPLE I WOULD NEVER EVER GO HERE!!  I guess they were having a bad night or they don't like big parties, but man, she did not like us. BTW, 2 waitress that night, there was a pretty young brunette, and she was nice enough, started serving our table in the beginning, then just left.  It was all very twilight zone. Really hate giving bad reviews to small business.  The Scooter Club or Metro Phoenix Officially BOYCOTTS Fibber Maguees!  Cheers!",

Fibber's is your classic multi-faceted pub/bar that pours out great craft beers while cranking out awesome tunes. Lets have another, and review Fibber Magees.  ~Fud/Drink~ I can only really vouch for the drinks here...Just for starters. They have a very well-rounded selection of craft beers on draft from around the country that is rotated very often... I would assume more than just a seasonal rotation. Besides the crafts, they offer up all the traditional pub favorites on draft as well, my personal fav being Smithwicks. They also serve up their own special cocktails and offer a full bar, as well as a menu chocked full of traditional Irish pub food. I have had the garlic fries before, and they were OK... I have had better  (sorry Meagan B.!) Next time I am there, I will what my diet can allow me to eat, and report back with my review on the food.  ~Atmosphere/Service~ Each time I have gone, I have been there when my favorite Irish Rock band \"Keltic Cowboys\" were playing. Being a loud band, the atmosphere was obviously a bit more upbeat. But, that tells me that this location knows how to get the place rockin' and keeps their customers happy. Different flare is located across the wall, from sprots to different Irish heritage signage. The inside is predominantly wood based, so its got that old-style bar feel, nothing contemporary to this place. It is not overtly loud when the band is not playing, however it can get crowded on busy nights, making it a tad difficult to get to the barkeeps. The bartenders are knowledgeable, and helped me pick a couple brews out when I first started trying to get into darker colored beers...So hats off to them! Service is a bit lacking, however, from the waitstaff. This is due mainly in part to the fact that they had 1 person running tables, during a show, on a SATURDAY NIGHT. That's not helping anyone...not the waitress who is trying her best, or the customers. We barely got touched during our 2+ hours there...I'd say about 3 times....that's no bueno. So note to management, get an extra body out there to help everyone out!  ~Extras/Rating~ Overall, this place keeps serving me well. I really love coming here, and despite the 25+ minute drive from Phoenix, it is totally worth it when a band is playing or if you have some friends whom want to relax and kick back. I must note that they are an official Gameday location for Seahawks fans, and my UYE group will be heading over soon enough to drop in and see how the location fares. I can't wait to return to kick a couple back, sooon...sooon...",

Lately the staff they have brought in is less than spectacular.  They are slow, unfriendly, and need to learn a little bit about customer service.  We sat at the bar last night and waited over 10 minutes just to have them take our drink order.  We had to flag down the bartender PJ several times to get food orders and our second round of drinks.  I found him to be rude and condescending when we dealt with us.  Also noticed several other customers had to flag him down to order more drinks. Not what I consider good customer service.  There were a few people in the place but it was not what I would consider busy.   Food took well over 30 minutes to arrive.  We just ordered flat bread and a salad.  In the past this would have been there in under 15.  The flat bread was cold and a portion of it was missing.  It must have stuck to the pan when they were making it.  In the past the place always felt like the comfortable bar to stop by after work, now it felt cold.   Like I said, we have been coming here for years but if the service is like this the next time we stop by, we might need to look at other options.",

An Irishman (as in a man from Ireland, not an American with an Irish name) I know recommended this place, since the drive to Tim Finnegan's is no longer feasible from Chandler.   Now it should be understood that an Irish Pub that serves great Guinness will also have great pub food (at least in America, ironically, it wasn't easy finding good food in Ireland). Fibber Magees is definitely a good destination for food and drink.  Before we entered the door, we were greeted with the sound of live Celtic music. There is a decent size stage for live entertainment, which is nice to see. The bar and front area is quite big and open, but it can become quite crowded and loud on the weekend.  The food and drink.  Guinness is very tasty. I am not going to expound on this matter but any Guinness drinker will tell you if it is right on, or off - it was right on.  Fish and Chips. Definitely different, but very good. Excellent quality fish, but they serve you a huge piece which needs to be handled with a knife and fork. Fries were also very good, cole slaw was good but very skimpy, like two bites. They need to make the portion of slaw larger and the fries smaller. Tarter sauce was OK, I think they could be more creative and deliver a less bland tarter sauce.  On the second visit, had the corned beef and cabbage. Very good, ordered the horseradish as well, excellent horseradish. I still believe the best Corned Beef and Cabbage is at the Q Bar in Peoria on Wednesday's, but that is an insane drive from Chandler, and the place always reeks of fish.   Service here was excellent, and I will definitely return.",

    "text": "Just tried out Fibber's on the way home with some friends the other day. All of us would agree that this is a 5-star. The atmosphere was very cool, open and easy to get around. The service was excellent and our waitress was very attentive. The beer was great and great selection! The food was outstanding. 2 of us got fish and chips and it was huge! A large piece of fish right on top a gigantic order of fries, definitely a knife and fork meal. 1 of my friends got a shepard's pie and it was also huge. He said it was delicious and judging by the dent he put in it, he wasn't lying.   Myself and another friend got a burger and it was so damn good and  cooked perfectly to medium as I had asked. I Got bacon because I'm a man and it was a different type of bacon but was insanely delicious along with the great fries. $5 burgers on Mondays or all you can eat fish and chips on Friday's we saw there, so we'll definitely be back. Huge fan, would love to see some live Celtic music that people are talking about below. Try this pub, especially if you love a good atmosphere and pub food!",

I have been coming here since they opened and in the past I felt this place was a well deserved 3+ stars.  My how times have changed.  The past 4-5 times I have been here the service has just been awful.  We came with a friend 2 weeks ago and she was appalled at how she was consistently ignored  only because she asked for water to start and then she wasn't followed up on the rest of the night.  The food is decent, the beer prices are high but the service is 0 stars.  On our last and final trip here we came in and sat down waiting 10-15 minutes with no acknowledgement.  I finally got ready to order from the bar when a waitress that had passed us several times comes by and says, this table is taken you will have to move they are outside smoking.  No apology, no nothing....just get up.  The table was empty and there was no indication anyone had been sitting there. I told her we had been sitting there 10-15 minutes waiting to order and she just walked away not caring.  Had this been a one time thing u could understand, but the service is so bad that I will not return.  Too bad this place isn't close to what it used to be.",

They do a good job bringing in live music and having activities/events throughout the week.   Local Dines/Groupon Users - they won't let you use your coupon if you have ANY discounted items on your bill, regardless of how much you've spent on  regularly priced items. This includes happy hour or daily food/drink specials.  They're pretty strict about this.   We ran up a $100+ tab on regular priced food & drinks, but had 1 happy hour beer on our bill. The manager wouldn't apply our coupon unless we paid full price for the beer.  Wasn't a big deal, but we've never had this issue w/ other restaurants, so just a heads up.",

The background music was at the perfect level for conversation and the staff was friendly.  While I'm still sad that they took my favorite item off the menu, the food was excellent.  I had a chicken sandwich, and it was juicy and perfect.  Kevin had the shepherds pie, and loved every bite of the tender lamb.   Later on, there was some live music, but as it was one singer with an acoustic guitar, it was the first time conversation was possible with live music.  She played at the right level for the smaller weekday crowd.  Our server was great, as we moved from patio, back inside, back to the patio, and was friendly and prompt all night.",

    "text": "The best traditional Irish pub in the valley just got a whole lot better!  With a great new menu and fantastic happy hour deals, Fibber Magee's has become our new favorite place to enjoy food and cocktails.   We especially enjoy the half price flat breads and appetizers from 4 to 7 p.m., my favorites being the lamb skewers and the short rib sliders.  The happy hour drink specials are also a great deal with my favorite beer, an ice cold Stella Artois, priced at only $2.25 for a 17 ounce pint.    Fibber's has a very warm and comfortable atmosphere, with eye-pleasing wooden tables, chairs, floors, bookcases, etc.  The bar has very good background music, and the live bands that regularly appear are always entertaining.  Fibber Magee's also has some of the coolest bartenders and wait staff we have ever met.  Clayton, Will, Mark, and Mike all have a way of making us feel right at home every time we visit.",

We turned to Yelp, read reviews of several places, and quickly realized that Fibber Magee's was the place to check out.  Great pub!  The first thing I noticed was the beautiful woodwork.  Aside from the positive visual aesthetic, the service was great.  We were immediately greeted at the door and promptly served our beers by the friendly bartender.  Said bartender kept coming back to check on us and chat.  Tasty bar eats, too!  In order to try a few things off of the menu, we opted for a few apps:  the chicken tenders and the fish sliders.  Awesome!  Both were fantastic for bar grub.  Yum!  I have a feeling we'll be popping by again before our vacation is over!  Friendly staff and friendly locals.  Great happy hour.  We felt right at home.  I'm glad we happened upon this Irish pub.     Thank you, Phoenix Yelpers, for pointing me to Fibber Magee's!",

The food is great with generous portions and really good daily specials, but my favorite part of fibbers is the staff!! They are extremely competent and friendly!! They try hard to anticipate any needs and always take a minute to stop by and say hello even if we aren't at one of their tables! Obviously great management as the staff all seem to love being there!!! Thanks for helping us have a fun time every time we come!!",

Done. Drinks - B+/A- I like the availability of Irish/English brews on tap and they have cider. I am a freak for cider, but that's just me. Oh and their house wines are legit.  Seating - A++ Dark Corners, tables, Booths, High tops.  The Patio - Decent sized for what you gotta do out there. Hey, and there's a game room! Sweet.  When I used to live in Chandler this was an often visited watering hole. I kinda miss its chill vibe OH and I forgot to mention: There's a Filibee's in the parking lot.

What sets Fibber Magee's apart from the competition is the great staff, who actually take some time to talk to you instead of just pouring your drink and sending you on your way - and who actually pour a proper two-stage Guinness pour without having to ask for it.  The atmosphere is great, and the live music was very enjoyable.  Food-wise, can't say too much about it except that the curry fries are delicious (don't knock it 'til you've tried it).

    "text": "5/12/10  Came in to try some happy hour eats (Fibber Magee's offers 50% off all apps and flatbreads between 4p and 7p).  To begin my dining experience, I found the darkness in the pub to be overwhelming (a word I'd rather use in this context is \"oppressing,\" but I'm trying to lighten up!).  I wouldn't have minded so much (as I could've sat closer to the door left ajar, which allowed light to come in), but then the music blaring out of the speakers overhead was just too much!  To compound the situation, the song selections were either U2 (which I liked) or jarring Irish punk rock (which I don't), most of which were of the latter.  :(  Perhaps I should've walked away after making these observations, but I've had FM bookmarked for at least six years now, and I wanted to get it over with.  After many inquiries about food preparation, the bread used (which company?  specific ingredients used?), etc., I decided I'd go w/ the crabcakes and the braised rib sliders.  The crabcakes (topped w/ roasted red peppers and garnished w/ wasabi and mustard mayo, the latter I opted out) also came w/ a side mixed greens salad and a citrus vinaigrette. While this dish wasn't the best-looking of all the dishes I had that afternoon- don't let the pic of the bread pudding fool you, it was the best-tasting, but this isn't saying much.  I didn't care for the watered-down flavor of the citrus vinaigrette, and frankly, the crabcakes had enough flavor, so the lack of dressing wasn't a big deal.  I don't know if I'd order them again, though...  What was a big let-down was the braised shortrib sliders' dish.  Now these sliders looked fantastic, but the shortrib pieces were so sinewy and/or fatty, that, as much as I tried, I couldn't chew through any!  I really wanted to like these, bec. of those gorgeous-looking fried onion strings that sat on top of each slider.  Thankfully, my server offered to swap them for something else, and it was w/ a little sadness that I said goodbye to those onion strings :'(  Lately, mussels haven't appealed to me, so my server's suggestion to try FM's wasn't giving me much hope.   Surprisingly, these mussels tasted OK, and the price is right (for happy hour), and if I weren't already not disappointed in the darkness of the pub; the loudness of the music's volume; and the sub-par quality of the shortribs, I may have enjoyed them more.  With the hope of finding something good to write about, I ordered the bread pudding.  (At this point, I should've just given up.)  The bread pudding dish, which you'd think, looking at the pics I took, would taste good,  was a disaster!  It was dark in the pub, yes, but the dish looked like they just placed slices of bread down, showered them w/ dried cranberries, and poured some white chocolate sauce.  Something was amiss- was it even baked?  How was it prepared?  There wasn't enough cream sauce to cover most of the bread.  I was told that the bread was indeed soaked in the cream, and then baked, but this bread pudding had to be the worst I've ever tried.  The pics looked great, but don't be fooled...    The server was friendly, and most of the stars reflect her attempts to appease me, but I didn't enjoy my experience there, and would never recommend this place to anyone.",

I'm not much for soda and juice has too much sugar and I don't drink... So the hubby gets a shot. Which ends up being $7!  Our fish and fries come and the fries are soggy and swimming in oil and the fish batter,although tasty in beer batter, is thick and uncooked. It was still doughy inside... I ask the waiter for melted butter but apparently this isn't something you can get as it only comes in sticks... Because melting butter isn't a thing here.. No apologies from the waiter... Never checked of we liked our food or if we wanted anything else.., when he stopped back we asked for the check. He brought it with no questions slapped it on the table and walked away... No thank you for coming to fibbers... Needless to say.... We will not be going back.... Cost is too high service is bad  food was not impressive at all.",

The crowd was a mix between older people and 20-30 year olds. The bartenders were for the most part, nice. Overall had a good time at this bar and will be back again.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, after a recent visit to Fibber's, I'm going to have to update my earlier review and drop a few stars.  One of my biggest pet peeves about this place (that I used to overlook, but no more) is that the wait staff is inattentive. They are usually nice, but inattentive. They never bring you water with your alcohol (which actually causes them to lose money - the more hydrated you are, the more drinks you order). They don't check to see how your food is. You could finish your whole meal just waiting for them to bring you malt vinegar. They don't clean your plates when you're done eating. It takes forever to get your 2nd round of drinks. This last visit, I was charged for drinks I didn't even order and had to wait forever for our server to come by so I could have her re-ring the check, which again took forever.   We ordered our usual this last time (fish and tri-tip sliders). Neither of them were as good as I had remembered from previous visits.   The thing that sucks is that we invited some friends to join us for happy hour. They had never been to Fibber's before. My friend, who is more \"observant\" than me, pointed out all the places on the walls & ceiling where the decor was dusty, falling apart and just junky. Someone in management needs to pay attention to the details. Needless to say, our friends were not impressed and doubt they'll ever go back with us. Of course, after this last experience, I'm not sure we'll ever go back anyway.",

They are extremely knowledgeable, always ready to recommend something delicious, and are always very fun to talk to.  The Drinks: Wine? Yes! Whiskey? Yes! Every other type of liquor you could possible want? Yes! Draft / Canned / Bottled Beer? Yes! Yes! Yes! Fantastic selection. I always take a look at their ever-changing craft beer list before making my decision. I've been able to try beers that I didn't even know existed! The beer is always cold and there is always something on special.  The Food: Let's face it... after a few cold ones you're going to want to eat and Fibbers has you covered! There are different food specials every night and I've had almost everything. Those thin garlic fries are great, the burgers, flatbreads, Shepard's pie, Meatloaf, DESSERT... seriously, get some food while you're there.   The Atmosphere: It's an Irish pub... Nothing better than going in to listen to an acoustic band after work during the week! If I had one complaint I would say the bands on Fridays and Saturdays are a little too loud.  The Price: Daily food and drink specials, happy hour, reverse happy hour, shot specials, beer of the day specials... you can always get a good deal here  Best Irish Pub. Period.",

    "text": "I live a mile from here and trust me when I say I've been here a lot. It used to be our go to place for a quick dinner when we didn't want to cook. It also used to be the place we'd go for group get togethers in the back room. The bartenders and servers were always awesome and friendly, even remembering our names and favorite beverages. The food was pretty good, too.   Now let's jump ahead to now. Over the last year new management has taken over. This was an Irish Pub and pretty authentic feeling, but the new owner has a family member who plays for the Seahawks (American) football team so it's quickly becoming an NFL sports bar.   Happy Hour used to be from 4-7 which is great for those who work 8-4 and 9-5. Now they changed it to 3-6, which means by the time we start thinking of going out for appetizers and drinks, everything is full price again. Used to have great half price appetizers, but you can forget that now!  My friend wanted a burger the other day and brought the 8year old with her. Was going to give the kid some of her burger, but the server said it was $2 to split a meal now. She's a little girl and barely eats anything, but the server was practically scared that her manager would find out. She said if her manager came out and discovered it, then he'd charge the lady for two meals. That's ridiculous!  As I said, we used to come here all the time but this last year the changes have been terrible. I will be going elsewhere in the future.",

All the food has been good especially the corned beef hash breakfast and my favorite at both locations the muscles. The sweet chilli wings are good as well.  For Seahawks games you have to get here early as the sight lines to the big screen aren't great and there are quite a few tables that you pretty much can't see.  The beer selection is good and they often has deals on Guinness and other Irish beers.  Fun place to come and watch a game with good food and drinks.",

I have been here a few times and have enjoyed myself. I gave it four stars because it is a little cramped when there is a band and our waitress was not the greatest because we had to wait forever for our checks.     Last time I went, they were having a Halloween costume party and the Keltic Cowboys were playing so I decided to go. I tried their drink called, The Dirty Pear, which is Guinness and Pear Cider. It was yummy! That night I also tried the fries or the \"chips\" as they call them. I was expecting an appetizer size since I ordered it off the appetizer menu but the waitress brought out a conical basket full of fries. I was able to full up on them so I didn't have to buy more food.  This place is a little hard to see because it is in a shopping center so you have to be on the lookout for it. I usually just type it into my Google maps and be on the lookout when I am close. I recommend coming here and checking out The Keltic Cowboys!",

I have also gone numerous times on non-event days and I've always enjoyed the atmosphere, pub food, bar staff and especially the booze.  Service at the tables is usually a bit slow, which is why I always know to order my James & Ginge Ale at the bar (tab open) and leave the meal order to my server.  Bar staff is attentive and, even when they're hella busy, they'll get you your drink quickly without the griping.  The atmosphere is totally casual and seating used to be a major biatch until they opened up the back part a year or two ago... now, that area has more darts and pool tables for your boozing and socializing needs.  Note that the patio gets full of smokers (if you don't care for that sort of air), so FYI.  I've eaten their flatbreads, their Shepherd's Pie and plenty of their Fish and I think their food is pretty damn tasty pub fare... to hell with the calories, I LOVE that fish!",
