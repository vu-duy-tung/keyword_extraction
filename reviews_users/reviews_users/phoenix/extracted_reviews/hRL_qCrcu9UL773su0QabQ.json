    "text": "Kabuki isn't a place I go for sushi often. I have my favorite places for sushi but I was at Tempe market place and it seemed like a good idea at the time.  The food itself is okay. It isn't great but it isn't horrible. It's the same quality as other chain Japanese restaurants. I had spicy miso ramen, which lacked in spiciness but had a good flavor. It lacked in substance though. They could really dress up the ramen other than few strands of seaweed, little bit of sweet corn tossed in and handful of bean sprouts.   The rolls were okay. Spicy albacore left a lot of spicy to be desired, salmon was fatty and good, just lacked a lot of flavor. The eel was tough and overcooked, not to mention there were still bones so I had to be careful with it.   Service was good. The waitress was fast and very polite. Definitely good service.  I sat at the sushi bar with my boyfriend and let's talk about the sushi chefs. There were 3 working while I was there, Oscar, Sam and Josh. Oscan was hispanic and Sam and Josh were Korean (I promise this will matter in just a minute). I was so offended and disgusted with Josh's behavior. I'm Korean myself and speak the language fluently. I guess Josh assumed I didn't because he and Sam were speaking in Korean and Josh REPEATEDLY cursed and called Sam a derogatory name. Oscar of course did not speak Korean and when he said something to Josh (nothing bad, just about the food), Josh called him another derogatory name in Korean. I could tell from their interaction Oscar was used to Josh saying something to him in Korean and not knowing what it was. Josh just kept talking like that to his coworkers, even going into his dislike for the current job. I came to enjoy a nice lunch. Did I have to sit there and listen to this? I don't care if you think I don't speak Korean. The fact that the chef can stand there in front of customers and belittle his coworkers and talk like that is completely disrespectful. Not to mention there was another couple at the sushi bar and he talked about them as well.   An employee was refilling my drink and he was not dressed like the wait staff so I asked if he was the manager and he said he was. I told him I didn't appreciate having to eat my lunch in an environment where the chef is cursing throughout my lunch and he said he will talk to them. He didn't even ask me which chef it was and instead, right in front of me, asked to see Sam. Sam went behind the curtain with the manager and within seconds, Josh followed Sam. They all came back less than a minute later and that was it. Sam and Josh was smiling and laughing when they came back to behind the bar.  This was truly an absurd lunch. I will personally never return to Kabuki but if you do go, be sure to sit in the dining room, not the sushi bar, especially if you speak Korean!",

The service was sadly still not up to par.   Food: got the BBQ ribs (I think that is what they were called) as an appetizer. They were delicious and would highly recommend them! For sushi got California roll, delicious, the Alaskan, also amazing and the gold rush, can't go wrong with it!   Service: we were seated at the sushi bar. Sushi chef was very nice, but our server ignored is for quiet a while until we were able to order apatite.    All-in-all, a much better experience and I will keep in coming, just don't want to have another poor experience.",

Their sashimi cuts are nice and generous which is something that really stands out to me. Rainbow roll was superb and Philly was delish also. NOTE: I'd prefer mine w/a little less cream cheese, as it starts to overpower the salmon.  I've dined at the Kabuki in Woodland Hills, CA also and had an impressive experience.  Great job Kabuki - you have won me over!",

I had the ninja lunch combo which included teriyaki chicken, 3 pieces of California roll, one piece of shrimp tempura and various vegetable tempuras.  With the combo there is more than enough food and chances are you will probably have leftovers.  The meal itself was decent.  The tempura batter was not as crunchy as I would have liked it, but the shrimp and vegetables are fresh and flavorful.  The teriyaki sauce on the chicken was nice- not too salty or sweet.  If I am in the area again I'd like to come here to try their happy hour or reverse happy hour.",

About water, I ordered the green ice tea, but I didn't think green ice tea was well at all, because that was too sweet for me. In my other hand, I think cook traditional Japanese foods need to put lots of miso; but when I did not taste too miso in spicy miso noodle, I still thought that was delicious restaurant.",

    "text": "My server was actually great.  Spicy tuna roll was pretty good and I love the miso soup as do my kids.  My kids usually like teriyaki chicken/beef so we got a combo lunch special and I had to force them both to eat a few bites at the very least, just kind of weird.    My problem was when the bill came and I used a coupon that was mailed to me in a Tempe Marketplace mailer with coupons.  I read the coupon VERY carefully for stipulations before arriving at the restaurant and saw what I was planning was qualified.  When I gave the coupon to the server he informed me that his manager told him to tell me that even though it wasn't stated on the coupon we had to have a minimum purchase of $30.  I asked to speak with the MGR who again told me that he was sorry but that some people come in and only spend $10 and then he doesn't make any money (how is this my problem?) I told him that the coupon was the sole purpose of my choice to eat lunch here today and try it out and if this is my first impression of your restaurant this does not make me want to return.  He apologized again and I said you should really put a sign up at the very least and even that would leave bad taste in my mouth but was better than nothing.  He informed me there was a sign up.  I paid my bill and did not punish my server with the tip as I so wanted to but knew it wasn't his fault.  I then looked for the signage for the coupon on my way out the door and could not find it anywhere.  I left the restaurant looked around and then re-entered the restaurant and eventually found it where we never walked by when we were seated.  Very poor management as far as I'm concerned and I won't return.  I do have to mention the mgr did offer on my way out to buy me dessert however my kids had an appt. and we didn't have time.  If you are going to offer me a $5 dessert why not just accept my coupon and go the extra $5 to make me happy and want to return?  So for a lousy $10 they lost a return customer and I will probably spread the word whenever this restaurant comes up in passing or conversation.  Oh yeah and on YELP!",

    "text": "So we came here on a Saturday night at 8ish for dinner before a movie. Hostess told us 20-30 minutes....ended up being over an hour. We wouldn't have waited except there was live music outside and we had a spot near a fireplace. Our server, Dillon, was really nice. Made a point to find out if we were waiting long, even though it wasn't his fault...place was busy. Food is okay... Tempura - standard, poke was pretty good. I think they topped the shishito peppers with bonito flakes, which I didn't like too much. Rolls were ok. I really like spicy tuna rolls, so if a place doesn't get that right, it's all downhill for me. Not likely to go just for kabuki, but if I happen to be at Tempe marketplace, and I want sushi... Guess I don't have a choice",

    "text": "I LOVE sushi...and if I could eat this for every meal, I would! I usually go to the same places...but I decided to try some place new. Since I have heard great things about this place and I am in the area everyday, I decided to try Kabuki one day for lunch at the Tempe Marketpalce. I had been to their other location in Glendale before, and it was horrible service and their rolls fell apart with one touch. I give second chances though. So I ordered a couple different speciality roles that I have never had before at other sushi resturants. When my rolls came, I experienced the same thing I did at the other location...every roll I picked up fell apart! You can't eat sushi rolls when they fall apart as you try and put it in your mouth. Your plate is left with all the droppings and it really just takes the fun out of eating it. The service was ok, nothing special. They do have a rewards club called the Red Mask club where you earn points for every dollar you spent. I happened to go during a double point time so I earned more points for dining that day....but I highly doubt I will be back anytime soon to see the benefits of these points. I will stick with what I know until something else comes up!",

They no longer have a reverse happy hour, though their website still said so on Friday, June 13, 2008, which is the date I dined there.  The service was slow and very rude.  I felt that the server was disappointed we decided to eat there.  The hostess was also very rude and avoided eye contact, tossing our menus onto the table and turning around before introducing any specials or saying a server would be right with us or something.  It also took almost 20 minutes to receive our check at the end of our meal, though we were one table out of only about eight that were left among several servers.  Several servers were also gathered around a table of guests seated near us, laughing and chatting, while the rest of us waited for service.  This experience was so terrible for the boyfriend and I that we will not be returning again.  What a turn for the worse!  Forget everything I said in that first review; now this place has shown its True colors!",

    "text": "First Off, I have only gone there for happy hour during Mon-Fri.  No Weekends.  However, I am a frequent Sushi eater, and not just because it's trendy...  I do like Kabuki because of it's pricing, the rolls are usually ok, not the best, but certainly good for the money.  We usually do not drink there, but their drink menu is very cheap.  However, EVERY time I have gone there, it's pretty much dead, and the service has SERIOUSLY been lacking.  I always go with the same friend, we always order the same things, most of the time it's between the same 3 waiters.  Its ALWAYS slow.  They ALWAYS forget at least one thing we ordered.  It always take WAY longer than any other Sushi place we go to (even when those other places are slammed).  The only reason I finally decided to write a review was that I ordered a couple new things this last time, and they were completely unacceptable.  We ordered 4 different types of Rolls, and two types of Sashimi.  The rolls were sticky and tasted not very fresh, the avocado on one was turning brown.  The Sashimi was left off of our order until we asked for it 2 times, then it came out oviously old, sticky, and smelly.  Unedible.  We had to ask for Wasabe which has always been included before, and when it came out it was obviously old and dry as well.  My main upset was about the Tempura Mozzarella we ordered which was a first.  It was unedible as well.  The first bite was great, but it was STUFFED with Jalapeno STEMS.  Not pieces of the peppers (which I would have picked out anyways bc it just didn't suit the tempura AT ALL) but woody, extremly spicy STEMS.  DISGUSTING.  I WILL NEVER GO BACK.  Too many failed attempts.  Above all, THERE US NO EXCUSE FOR THE THOROUGHLY SHI**Y SERVICE.  NO excuse.",

    "text": "My wife loves good tempura so we went to try this place.  As most other reviewers have said, this place is just so-so.  The prices are higher than most other Japanese restaurants by about 15-20% due to its location and ambiance.  The tempura was mediocre at best.  I had the luncheon tonkatsu which was good, but not outstanding.  At least it wasn't too thin or overcooked.  I also noticed that they had toro on the menu so I ordered a sashimi side order for $24.  I must admit, the toro was good and they gave me a pretty presentation with an ample serving for the price.  Toro is always very expensive so I was not surprised or disappointed.  We also ordered a couple of side orders of ala carte nigiri sushi just to try -- again, OK, but not outstanding.  I also ordered a large Asahi beer @ $7.50 each; a little high by Phoenix standards.  In summary, the food was OK, but nothing that would support my going back and paying the higher prices.  The service staff is friendly, but not well versed in Japanese food fare and this makes for unknowledgeable people who cannot answer questions about the food and its preparation.  I guess they are trying to cater to the Americans and not placing much emphasis on the authenticity of the food they are serving.  Our lunch bill for two came to $70, which is high for lunch by any standard.  But the manager never came over to ask how we liked our meal or what we thought, or anything like that.  Don't get me wrong -- I don't expect special treatment, but my experience is that if you have a patron that spends a lot of money at your restaurant, you should always go say something to make them feel comfortable and increase the chances that they will come back.",

My girlfriend and I were greeted by the hostess who seemed to be having a bad day as she was very abrupt and unfriendly. Our waitress however was a little more bubbly and up to par with what one would expect for customer service. We proceeded to order some miso soup, seaweed salad, unagi, spicy tuna roll, spicy albacore roll, and we tried a couple of their specialty rolls. This is where our experience really started going down hill. The miso soup was good, but you really cant screw that up. I would think the same thing about seaweed salad, but there was something not quite right about the salad. Everything else was absolutely horrible. The texture of the rice was off, the fish didnt seem fresh, and the unagi was so bad that both my girlfriend and I had to choke it down. My girlfriend and I had both concluded that this was some of the worst sushi we had ever had, and we have both tried a lot of different sushi places over the last decade. I would not recommend this place to anyone.",

Our meals came with a snoozer salad. I ordered the tempura shrimp and veggies. Mine came 10 min. after everyone's orders were served. Thinking the tempura was going to be hot and crispy after the wait and was thoroughly disappointed. One look at my meal caused me to laugh in despair. 2 finger length green beans, 2 half dollar sized yellow squash, 2 green squash sliced so thick they were raw, and 3 small shrimp. All Luke warm and not crispy at all! (Soggy) looked like an appetizer. $10.99 mind you. Came with a dipping sauce that tasted like watered down soy sauce. Asked for wasabi and pickled ginger on the side. 1/4 teaspoon of each, size of a dime. Server was never to be found and never refreshed our drinks. Can you believe she was training somebody as well? Ha ha!!! My wife and I's bill came to $25. Nobody was really happy with their meal either. I was still hungry so I sampled my daughter's chicken. Half dollar sized medallion of white meat chicken. Dry, dry dry....no flavor even soaking in the soy sauce water the call broth in her bowl and I soaked it in wasabi and soy sauce. This place sucks big time! What a shame. The Pro's..parking. I was screwed by the other location too so I guess it was my stupidity for coming back. Please don't waste your hard earned money here. Not even close to authentic Japanese food!

I was here for Gen opening but decided to stop by here. Gen was too long, I got there at 8pm and it's busiest time of the day, I should have known to come earlier, lesson learned. Lol I think kabuki was extra busy today  because all the customers from Gen came I here because they didn't want to wait. Lol",

They do give you free edamame and a 15% discount for showing your student ID but that's about all they have going for them. We ordered the Vegas (my usual staple) and the seaweed wrap was thick and hard to chew. Our other rolls seemed to have a mushy- not sticky- rice texture. The service was a bit slow and our waiter seemed out of it. Overall, we have spent less at sushi places for better quality. It's worth the 2 mile drive to SakeBombers!",

We were seated promptly and our waiter came and got our drink order . . . Green Iced tea for me and a soda for the Birthday boy . . . hard to screw up a soda, but the green tea tasted water down and was cloudy . . . obviously not a fresh brew  (minus one star).  We both ordered the seaweed salad . . . and since I had eaten it before, I was really looking forward to it . . . the seaweed was great, but more than half the salad was arugula . . . really arugula . . . are you kidding me, I ordered a seaweed salad  (minus one half star).  Along with the salad we ordered a Lotus Roll . . . rices was not sticky, so the roll fell apart . . . the lobster was luke warm and way to chewy . . . whats going on . . . those appetizers were my go to items  (minus one half star).  Entree my friend had the tempura shimp, and I had the Koshou Beef . . . the beef was tough and chewy, shitaki mushrooms were almost unrecognizable, the asparagas was over cooked and mushy . . . and the sauce . . . well lets just say it had a burnt taste to it . . . overall not a very good entree  (minus one star).  The atmosphere and service were good . . . but again . . . nothing to write home about.

At the time we got the check I told our waiter that we were there for happy hour and that our check did not reflect those prices and she said that because we got seated a few minutes before happy hour started (probably 5-10 minutes before) she had to charge us full price. We are regulars there for happy hour, the hostess even recognized us so there rationale was ridiculous.  For the past few times I gone there the service has been ridiculous!",

I left the salad behind but the poke was super delicious, well seasoned and fresh. I got a side of rice and asked for happa rice (half brown, half white). My waitress was nice enough to accommodate my request by serving me half white and half brown, not the mixed together rice that I am used to, but the rice was delicious. Second to the quality of the fish, the quality of the cooked rice really makes or breaks a place for me, and this place ad great rice. I got there during happy hour so after my meal I also tried the salmon sushi, which means salmon nigiri, I thought i was getting a sushi roll, but it ended up being two pieces of sake nigiri. I was a little dissappointed in the way the salmon tasted. Salmon is my most favorite fish but this one wasn't terribly fresh. Definitely not as good as the tuna I had in my poke.  I gave them 3 stars because I had pretty bad service. I think my waitress forgot about me. I was sitting at the sushi bar and ordered everything at the same time as soon as I sat down. I got my poke directly from the sushi chef first, then waited 10 minutes for my rice, later got my edamame appetizer and had to remind her that I asked for water too. It all came out of order!  Truly, the service wasn't bad enough to keep me from returning. I'll definitely go back to eat my way through their menu",

That's not a knock on Kubuki, I simply don't like egg sushi and can't stand asparagus so I gave them to my niece.

    "text": "Nestled within the confines of Tempe Marketplace lies Kabuki - a great Japanese restaurant with great food, service, and style.  Four of us walke in on a Sunday evening and were quickly seated - my eyes going right for the Chicken Teriyaki on the menu.  I don't go in much for Asian cuisine, but this exceeded my expectations.  The sheer amount of juicy chicken I received was glorious, and it came with soup AND salad.  Everything was tasty, the chicken wasn't completely drenched in sauce (which is what I usually expect to happen) and the miso soup and salad nicely complemented the main course.  I also feel like you often get skimped on rice at places like this but that was a non issue here!  Our server was great for the most part.  My only nitpick is that I was served my salad, soup, and chicken all at once within minutes, but the three others I was with didn't receive their food for another ten minutes.  I tend to expect better coordination than that from the kitchen.  Overall a great evening, I would go back if given the opportunity.",

I came here for dinner with a friend and we opted to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather.  There was 15 minutes left for happy hour and we took advantage of it. We decided to order calamari rings as our appetizer and my friend got a mint lemonade. Initially it didn't taste like mint but when she got a refill it did. The rings were okay; I liked that they were on a bed of greens and came with a sweet and sour type sauce. For our main dishes, we ordered the Las Vegas rolls, the Philly roll and the California roll. I'm not a fan of fried rolls but the LV wasn't bad, my favorite is always the Philly or any that has cream cheese in it. When I asked for Sriracha, our waiter also offered spicy mayo which was a nice addition. It was nice that they didn't charge extra for them and it was nice to have a choice of them.   Service was consistent and friendly and the food was worth the money. I'm not sure if it would be my first choice for sushi but I wouldn't mind coming back.",

    "text": "This is a really nice looking spot in the Tempe Marketplace where I met a Client of mine for lunch. I had a reservation and was seated right away and noticed how busy the restaurant was.  We had tea and I ordered a Chilean Sea Bass along with their Brussels sprouts appetizer and my client ordered the Chicken Teriyaki.  Surprisingly, we received our dishes very quickly and I noticed how efficient they were with a packed restaurant.  But I have to say, as soon as I put my fork into my fish, I knew how they had it out so quickly. Maybe they microwaved it or it sat in a warmer, either way it was absolutely terrible. I literally put it on a side plate and put it to the side where the server took it along with some other side plates and never asked why I didn't eat my meal.  I would have loved to have said something but I was with a Client talking about business.  Further more, how do you mess up Brussels? Any time I see that dish on a menu, I'm ordering it and this was the worst Brussels I've ever had.  I was not a happy camper.  My Client felt the same way and couldn't believe he thought he chose a nice restaurant and we might as well have gone to a fast food joint, paid less and it would have tasted edible.   The prices absolutely do not match the quality of the food.  I will not go back here because I feel food is so important, so is taking my Clients out to really nice spots and I can't have a mishap happen again.",

    "text": "This review is regarding my visit today (07/20/18) at 7pm.   Normally, this is my go-to restaurant for amazing sushi. My baby brother is visiting from Texas and I was so excited to take him to my favorite restaurant.   We arrived about twenty minutes early for a 7pm reservation for four people. My mouth was already watering and I was going through a mental checklist of all the rolls I was going to order.   The hostess was extremely friendly and sat us down promptly. Immediately after taking our seats, my party and I felt very warm. Apparently we weren't the only ones because several people from the tables in our section were fanning themselves with their menus. Our hostess told us there was a slight issue with the AC and that they were working on it. No big deal. Or so I thought. It just seemed to get warmer and warmer.   Our server took our drink orders and when I asked him about the AC, he blamed the humidity - stating that it's making everything feel muggy and gross. He also blamed the temperature on the amount of customers. It was a full house. Still, it shouldn't be that bad. At least I didn't think so. BUT, I drank a couple of glasses of cold water and I stopped perspiring.   We placed a pretty large order with a strategy. First the three apps, then the first round of sushi (four rolls), then the second round of sushi after that (another three rolls). Our server was amazing and he placed the order exactly the way we asked. Super attentive and friendly.   Well, it was a good thought while it lasted because everything wound up coming to our very small table at the exact same time. Still, we're a creative bunch and we made it work. No big deal.   Now, here's where I really took issue. The fish on the rainbow roll I ordered wasn't cold. That really bothered me because I'm super picky about sushi and I kinda have this thing where I like raw fish to be cold. Then I tried the barbecue beef ribs. They were so bland and lacked the flavor I'm used to tasting. I then tried the dragon roll and was severely disappointed. The unagi tasted like butane and I couldn't continue eating it. The Alaskan roll was assembled lazily and it was literally falling apart when it came to my table. We had to use a spoon to pick up and piece because it couldn't hold its shape!   Now, I can forgive a lot of things but I have a big problem when the food I'm paying for isn't up to par. On every other occasion I've been to this location, the food was amazing. Tonight was just a fluke, I suppose. I'm not the only one in my party who thought so. It was very warm in there and the food was such a disappointment that we all decided to leave.   I finally asked our server for the check and he asked if everything was okay. I told him that a lot of the food just wasn't the same quality that we're used to. I explained that we love Kabuki but that tonight was lacking in a lot of ways. He offered his apologies and that was pretty much it. No resolution or offer to make it right. We paid for our check and left for a different restaurant.   TL;DR  Restaurant was warm, raw fish not cold, food didn't taste the same, so we left for another restaurant.",

He's a big fan of all things Asian...hell, I'm surprised he married me and not the girlfriend he had in Japan.  Maybe she was not such a fan of all things American.  Anyhow, I digress.  So I really don't love sushi all that much, but I have at least come to the point I will eat just a teeny bit of raw fish, but for the most part, I stick with salmon and shellfish.  I ordered a Rose roll and a Dynamite roll.  The Rose roll (shrimp tempura, avocado, and spicy tuna) was tasty, but the nori was really tough and chewy.  I don't recall ever noticing that before with a sushi roll.  But, Kabuki's pieces are so big that I didn't really want to shove the whole thing in my mouth, but that's pretty much what I had to do.  The Dynamite roll (vegetables, crab, and scallops on top of a California roll) was also good for this limited sushi eater, but the spicy mayo sauce or whatever it was over it was overwhelming.  Just way too much of it, and that says a lot since I don't really love sticky rice and prefer a little sauce of some kind.  Half as much would have worked.  We did have good service and might come back if we are already at Marketplace, but it wouldn't be a destination for me.  The restaurant was also very warm inside which made me paranoid about eating fish.  It was fine, but I want any place serving sushi to be an ice box.",

I'm not a huge fan of their specialty rolls -- I just don't get the appeal of cream cheese with sushi or huge fried rolls, so I usually just stick with the basics like nigiri or spicy tuna roll or the rainbow roll.  The reason they don't get 5 stars from me is because I wish they had more specialty rolls that incorporated fresh fish WITHOUT cream cheese or fried things.  The wait is never that long here, the atmosphere is fun, and I also like that they serve you complimentary edamame with your meal!",

My favorites are the sesame chicken, Philadelphia roll, and spicy tuna.  Perfect balance of fish to rice on their sushi and the happy hour prices are an awesome value.  Highly recommend for, quality, value and atmosphere.",

    "text": "I've never had a bad experience when dining at Kabuki. This place is decorated pleasantly with all of the perfect dimmed lights on each and every tables. The service here is uppermost with great smiles, friendly conversations, warmhearted approaches of all of the waiters and waitresses.   The reason why I don't go here often because it's so far from where I live. However, this place is still my number one preference and still attracts me to come back once in a while for romantic date nights, or fun nights out with colleagues. And much more than that is the allurement of luscious appetizers, sushi, and smooth cocktail drinks.   The garlic edamame is a must try. The edamame is dexterously sauteed well with light touch of sea salt and fried garlic on top. I'm not impressed much with the Tebasaki Karaage because sweet soy sauce is not my taste, but the Tokyo Quesadilla definitely makes up for it with the crunchiness and tomato salsa.   I tried the Oyster Shooter before, but I just personally didn't like it. The smell was too strong for me, and it grossed me out a little trying to swallow the whole shot down my throat. I guess I'd better stick with the ones that I usually get. After finishing so many side plates, I only have room for some salads, and Sashimi Salad is always my first main course selection. The plate is nicely frilled with spring mixed salad and sashimi on top.  About the drinks, I can't give enough compliments to the lady who worked at the bar on the crowded Friday night. She recommended me the Peach Cocktail and a House Mojito and certainly I got hooked with it. Such a pleasant experience, but I have to take off 1 star because of the long wait time.",

I can't remember our servers name but my mother and I sat outside and ordered a ton of sushi as well as a house salad. Unfortunately, we never received the salad. The server didn't even try to discount compensate it and we just took it to go after we finished our sushi because it came out so late. We tried one of the specialty orders of sushi and it was the BEST sushi I've ever tasted. I will go back again just to have it. Overall, a smooth and peaceful experience.",

    "text": "Extremely solid restaurant, the prices are higher than I know most college students would want to pay but the service was impeccable and it covered any short comings brought along by the food. Obviously it lacks the personal feel you might get in a smaller setting because of its size and number of staff but that isn't something you can really complain about.  As far as the food goes, I have been there a few times with friends and we always get tons of sushi along with a dinner/lunch dish for each of us. I wont review their entree's because it would be unfair to base my experience off of a handful of them when there are so many. The sushi, tasted great for Arizona standards. I'm from Los Angeles/Seattle big cities with fresh seafood, but Kabuki had really good quality sushi. There are places in Phoenix where the sushi just tastes like its been pre-made or just old in general. At Kabuki Im sure the seafood is as fresh as it can be in a land locked state, but wow its really impressive. The flavors arent too overbearing and a specialty sushi dish can really introduce you to the flavors you would expect based off of its name, without drowning you in them as if though to prove a point that yes in face YOU ARE eating a Jalapeno Roll. (Made up roll, just using as example)  One last thing, try to stray away from soda and water here because the other drinks on the menu are really worth it, the Matcha Iced Milk Tea was absolutely fantastic as well as a few other drinks I had off their menu. Really give this place a try, you wont be disappointed.",

We decided to take a seat out on the patio for a bite in the sun.  We immediately ordered drinks and began to check out the menu. A group of young ladies sat down across from us, I merely mention them because  they were my measurement for the timeliness of our service. As we waited behind them for most of our mean.   Our drinks were delayed with the bartender being out for the day, and the manager playing catchup to cover. Which is understandeable, except these ladies received theirs about ten minutes before we did. We were all very satisfied with the product we were receiving, but disappointed in the fact that we were watching food go by to tables that had seated and ordered after us. I'm not sure what to attribute this to, but it certainly affected the meal.  Great food overshadowed by some very long wait time. Will definitely consider it again, but will return to inside seating.",

I used to be able to rely on this place, to be one of the few places my whole family could eat at happily. Having Celiacs disease is hard enough. We used to be able to come here and all be happy with our meals. Until our most recent visit. We walked in and were informed that they threw out all their gluten free menus. Are you kidding? So what is the server just supposed to tell me everything that CAN be done gluten free? How am I now supposed to know what I can eat? Coming in and expecting my Celiacs to not weigh me down here, expecting a nice meal and boom, nope. I was looking at the gf menu they still have on their website. And told our server what I wanted, only to be told things were discontinued. So my family and I try to find a few things I can have, calling out items, only for our waiter to tell us \"no that has gluten in it. No that also has gluten in it.\" Are you kidding me!  Our poor server, was so awesome though. He even said he disagreed with the decision to get rid of the gf menu, because with it things were much easier and better. He was sincerely trying to help me find something I could eat. He went and searched high and low for a gf menu. He found ONE crumpled and bent. Brought it to me. But it was just the same out dated one on their website so it didn't help much.  The one sushi roll I was able to order, while tasted great, the pieces were cut so largely that when I ate them they hit my gag reflex in the back of my throat. So I couldn't even eat all of that. Over all this experience was extremely upsetting and stressful...and I don't plan to ever be coming back. I understand restaurants can't legally call things \"gluten free\" due to being a place that also serves gluten items and possible cross contamination. But that's common sense, any person with Celiacs understands. Though once you eliminated any kind of \"gluten sensitive\" menu, it was like you said you stopped caring about my needs.",

Whats the use of servers asking how you want things done if the cook is just going to cook it well done and then cheat the second time?",

All the times I've been there I have only had one issue. The waitress could not seem to get our drinks right, and when she did my hot tea was cold. This didn't get resolved until after our food was out. Other than that it has been a good experience.",

    "text": "I don't think I like Kabuki Restaurants in general (I also went to the one in Westgate).  Ambience: -very nice, I went here for a lunch date -intimate but spacious, plenty of seating -small patio for those who like to eat and people-watch  Staff: -took awhile for the hostess to return to her station to seat us -waitress was relatively attentive and friendly  Food: -free edamame starter... yum -**FREE** California roll with Yelp App check-in. No hassle getting the server to accept it, but it wasn't very good. We only ate 2 pieces, was warm/mushy. -we both ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Lunch Combo which also comes with Veggie and Shrimp Tempura, miso soup and a side salad. Alot of food for ~$10. My chicken was barely warm and dried out (can you say \"precooked\"), miso soup was delicious as was the tempura. I would not order the teriyaki chicken again.  Drinks: -a large sake bomber (during non-peak hours) was almost as much as the lunch... almost $10?!?!  Notes: -under the table had not been swept in awhile  Like I said at the beginning, I think Kabuki has been officially 86'd from my list of restaurants that I will willingly go to. It's like a Panda Express that someone put pearls and lipstick on. Cheap, mass-produced food in a nice sit-down atmosphere.",

We nicely asked if there was a booth ( there was because it was quiet) and the hostess could not have been more annoyed. Oh well! after 15 min of no service we finally were welcomed and asked for a drink order, which we were ready to place our food at that time. Between the 4 of us we ordered 5 rolls, we wanted a light dinner, and it literally took an hour and 15 min to be served. We watched other tables around us be seated and get their sushi before us. Another waiter even came over and asked if everything was alright because he could see the confusion on my face. The food was okay but the rolls were very sloppy and fell apart when picked up which made using chop sticks quite difficult.  I am just so disappointed, to get excited about date night and to have sad service. =[",

My daughter and I stood at the hostess stand while 4-yes 4 hostesses stood there talking to one another and looking at an ipad thing etc. Nobody acknowledged us-we literally stood there 5+ minutes without anyone even looking up or saying hi. We finally went past them to look for the rest of our party and sat ourselves without them saying a thing. Got to our party, no silverware or place settings. My son said they had been there over 15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged them.  After our server finally came over everything was spot on. Food came out correct, timely, drinks were kept full etc. 100% great service from our server. When we left....again no acknowledgement from the hostess stand.... not a stellar first or last impression. I think ultimately you pay alot of money for atmosphere and presentation. I don't know that hte amount of food you get is worth the money exception being the kids meals. Those are well worth it. The rest, meh-over priced and under portioned. Tastes good though.,.so..",

I had no intention to buy cold food that has been sitting for a while.

I love the mixed tempura here because the breading is thin and the dipping sauce compliments the tempura so much.  The spicy tuna roll is also a better quality than most of the other places I've been because the quality is good, but they also give you alot of tuna.  Other rolls that are good are the dragon roll and the caterpillar.    The happy hour drinks are always good. I always like get the hot sake as it is very cheap and delicious to me.  Sake bombers are good too!",

I forgot to take a picture though, darn it. It was a little confusing because it combines gluten free with vegan. Once I found out the ginger dressing is vegan (just not gf) I was good to go.  I ordered the tofu steak - same as at Westgate. I was tempted by the spicy tofu with crispy rice, but there was no description on the menu and the server said it was a \"spicy mayo sauce.\" The tofu steak was delicious, but could have used more sauce. I added soy sauce to stretch it.  Service was outstanding! Just the right amount of check-ins and refills. I look forward to going again and trying the veggie ramen!",

Our waiter seemed in a rush as well, walking away right after bringing plates and not asking if we needed anything. We had to flag her down a couple of times. It was nice to sit on the patio. They have a variety of vegetarian rolls and meal options. Overall it was a good time.",

But we ventured out so we could enjoy the nice weather and some sushi.   We placed the order for our daughter well before our sushi order. We ordered a sashimi special and a crunchy asparagus roll. The sashimi arrived first followed by the child's meal. Our roll didn't arrive until I flagged another server down and explained it had been 25 mins and our roll never arrived and our waitress never checked on us during our meal. I went to the hostess stand to speak to a manger, they said they would send one over. We had already paid our bill and waiting for an apology for more waiting was not how I wanted to spend my birthday. I definitely will not be returning.",

The food and portion size are defiantly a great value. I have loved almost every item I have tried here excluding one which is not the restaurant fault I have to blame my palate. Surprisingly I am not a big beef person but after trying their version of the teriyaki beef this is now a must order. The sushi is always fresh and the hot appetizers come out at the perfect temperature. My favorite is the sweet potato fries.   I have always loved the service. The wait staff is busy but not too busy to bring value to the experience. There is always a friendly manager on staff who is always thankful for the business.   This is a great date night, girls night, party of 5, quick lunch, and much more type of restaurant. It is geared towards all types of  Asian Fusion taste buds. The large menu of items allows everyone to pick what they like most. This is dining spot you won't get bored with because there is always a wide variety to choose from. The only issue is what to order next because it is easy to get hooked on the same things.   Be sure to check out the Happy Hour Menu. Trust me you will be happy!",

We dont go to happy hour for drinks we go for the food. The specialty rolls are very tasty, the regular sushi rolls are as well. They have lunch meals that are more than enough to fill you up for a very affordable price",

We had cold tofu, tuna tartar, calamari, seafood udon (my favorite here), two different kinds of rolls, clam miso soup, scallop sashimi and uni (sea-urchin). The girls liked the calamari and udon noodles, although it's a bit spicy. I didn't really care for the rolls, I think there was too rice. Besides the rolls, everything was scrumptious. My nieces ate and got to color and do little puzzles. They stayed busy while we tried to finish all the food. Nice place to go on a date, meet a friend, or have drinks with a group.",

Most sushi spots gladly substitute an ingredient if the regular order contains allergens I can't have without an upcharge.  Not Kabuki.  (I've had owners, chefs, and cooks tell me themselves that if a recipe is easily amenable, they'll gladly do the substitutions, w/ no offense taken.  This Kabuki chef isn't one of them.)  So food photos will reflect these recipe omissions.  Ordered a glass of house pinot grigio, which had a big black speck floating in it, but this was quickly remedied.    So few HH apps and drinks to choose from.  Servers were friendly enough, but sushi chef was VISIBLY annoyed (full face-frontal) when I had to return a dish as it contained an allergen I requested not to be used.  I could understand the offense if I had forgotten to include the info, or if I had multiple orders that made it hard for him to keep track, but a mistake on the second of two dishes, and with a list of allergens on a note right under your nose as a reminder??    Atmosphere is nothing to right home about.  I did like the lone red mosaic tile in the women's restroom.  Loved the contrast against the all-black theme.",

I don't know about the stuff that gets filled with cream cheese and deep fried or other cooked stuff, all I care about when I go to a sushi place is the quality and freshness of the fish, and this place was great.  I ordered: Salmon sashimi (the portion size was larger than expected) Masago Tobiko (they only have wasabi tobiko) Salmon nigiri Hamachi Toro  Uni Spider Roll Spicy Tuna (it was happy hour and ended up taking it back to the hotel for breakfast the next day - yum!)  Everything came out larger than I expected and super-fresh. With uni, the freshness is important, and it was great).  Places like these make me lament living on the east coast since we don't have as much access to the same freshness and qualify of the pacific species of fish.   The prices were reasonable and with happy hour got a 16 oz Sapporo for $5 and free edamame, 1/2 price salmon nigiri and the spicy tuna roll for less than $3.   This place not only  satisfied the sushi monster, I couldn't stop craving sushi for the rest of the trip. That is how tasty and fresh the sushi was.  I will be back. :-)",

The fact that they gave complementary edamame really saved this place from getting 1 star. Anyways overall I don't think I would come back here based on the bad service and the \"basic\" sushi everyone is hyping up.",

I would like to consider myself a foodie and one of my favorites is sushi, Uni sashimi is my favorite and I have travel extensively to find good and fresh Uni Sashimi. This is truly by far the best uni I have had, and I have to say the portions are very generous compared to other sushi bars. As far as my waiting staff, JP is the best.  He greeted us shortly after being seating and immediately took our drink order. He came immediately back with two waters with lemon and proceeded to take our food order. I could not believe how more attentive he could get, but he surely exceeded my expectations and pleasantly tried to go above and beyond his service. He ensured all food we ordered was prepared to our liking, and continued to come and check on drinks and kept our water filled. He brought us extra ginger and wasabi since both my husband and I love both. We were truly impressed with JD's service and additionally his very professional and pleasant manager, Zhen. This manager took the time to check in with us and ensure our food, service and experience was a perfect one. Thank you so much to both. We will be back soon",

Ordered a few rolls for friend I to share, we went with the Vegas Roll, Lotus on Fire Roll and Sunkissed Roll.  The Vegas roll was cream cheese, salmon, krab and avocado deep fired, it was good, just not my favorite, it's a textured thing I guess, not really into fired sushi, but my friend loved it.  The Sunkissed roll was spicy tuna roll with salmon & sliced avocados on top of it, this was a great tasting roll.  My favorite was the Lotus on fire, a California roll with spicy tuna & jalapenos & lotus root on top, delish! The perfect amount of heat too!   Everything was fresh, and service was great too, and since Kabuki is practically in my back yard I am sure I will be back soon!",

    "text": "This is always my favorite restaurant for about 12 years when i lived in Nevada and back in Arizona i always come back to both locations (in westgate and tempe marketplace) from times to times. Today dinner would be a four star except 1 thing the texting system. So we had a party of three check in on friday night. The place was busy so the wait was about 30 mins. The hostess had me input my phone number in and i got the text message right away at 7:12pm saying that i m in line waiting for the table. So I completely trust the texting system since i used it before at gen bbq next door and other restaurants. We walked down to harkins theater and up. When we were about to enter the barner bookstore across from kabuki, my husband asked me if it was 30 mins yet. I looked at my phone it said 7:45pm and had no text yet. We entered the bookstore and then i got the text saying my table is ready and i have 10 mins to get the table. So i rushed up the register and paid for my daughter's book then walked right across to the restaurant. That time was 7:47pm. I told the hostess i just got the text and the party of three with this name. She looked at me and SAID MY TABLE IS CANCELED because it was more than 10 mins. She claimed they sent out a text on 7:37 pm and they called my name out loud couple times but no show. First of all, if it s True i believe her that what the system say the text sent at 7:37pm, i got there at 7:47pm that is still 10 mins and they still cancels my table. Second of all, they might think i m lying but i just got the text message right at 7:45pm and i even read the text saying i have 10 mins to grab the table. That is why we left the bookstore and came in right away. So the texting system may have a delay. I completely trust the texting system that s why we didn't wait near the restaurant (inside restaurant there was no waiting seats) we decided to walk around because we trusted the system. So head up for everyone, if you come in busy time maybe best just wait around when they call your name. Or come when it is not busy. This is my first time ever use texting system with kabuki and i do not like it. And my phone is brand new as well. So other than that,  i love the waiter and my food. And thanks to the manager that steps in and sit us right away.",

Having not had sushi for a while, I went straight to the sushi section, particularly the specialty items. The ladies were also mostly interested in ordering sushi as well. There were quite a few to choose from, it took us a while to decide. I was not interested in eating any raw items so I made sure I selected the cooked rolls. Also since I'm on a dairy free diet, I had to choose the ones that didn't have cream cheese in them, still, I had quite a variety to choose from.  After taking some time to review the ingredients of all the rolls, I decided to order the lobster roll, the dynamite, as well as the king crab roll. The ladies ordered other items and one of us particularly ordered the sushi rolls with soy paper. Some ladies ordered appetizers too.  While waiting for our food to come, the appetizers were served and we were served 2 bowls of edamame. The edamame was good but it was cold. I have never had cold edamame before so it was fine but I prefer the hot one.  A little while later, our sushi rolls were served. All the items ordered on our table looked delicious. I tried the dynamite roll first and after trying my other two orders, dynamite was my favorite. The rolls were of a suitable size so I was full after eating only half of my order. During our dinner, our waitress came back to check on us and offer us refills. Her service was great.  Overall, a good experience. The food is pretty good and the prices are reasonable. I would like to take my husband there to try it soon. 4 stars rather than 5 bcz I wasn't absolutely blown away and because some ladies including myself complained that the rolls were falling apart. Will return however and try more items on the menu. Definitely worth going back to.",

The menu has shrank substantially removing some of the best items Kubuki had to offer.",

The hostess sat me at sushi bar, which was totally fine as I was a single diner. When the server finally arrived, he stated I needed to give my sushi order to the sushi chef himself. My server also expressed disappointment in me for not ordering food off the menu. When my sushi arrived it was the completely wrong rolls. They were cooked with what looked like cheese or some sauce all over the top. My server was MIA. I figured I was tired and probably ordered the wrong ones by checking the wrong box on the sushi sheet.  When I finally got a hold of the man who was so ashamed of me, he handed me my bill. I had in fact ordered the rolls correctly. But received the wrong ones. By then, I had a couple of bites and was ready to get out of there. The rolls were also ungodly expensive.  Never again.",

Somehow the rolls were lacking the flavor(badly). I would easily give this place 4 stars since I had so many good experience but it was that disappointing yesterday.

    "text": "We finally came tonight after the husband has been wanting to go FOREVER. I have been here once before but both locations (Tempe and Westgate) always seem impossibly far from our CenPho home. I don't want to work that hard for some sushi and usually only go if in the area. This location is in Tempe Marketplace so you can mix sake bombers with a little blurry retail therapy after. I had joined their Kabuki club and they frequently send me coupons for various occasions (family birthdays, anniversary, monthly specials). The menu is typical of most Japanese spots but there is also a lot of variety. For apps, we had the fried calamari and the garlic edamame. I usually only have regular edamame (which they bring out complimentary) but the garlic ones were addicting...I was literally licking the oil off my fingers and scrounging for the diced garlic in the bowl. I only stopped when the server came by to check. I am such a garlic junkie. I wasn't so much a fan of the thick batter on the calamari but the wasabi sauce it came with was really good. Not very spicy but with a nice kick. I had the Philly roll ($5.25) and the Jumbo Volcano app ($8) that was crab, avocado and spicy tuna baked with a little eel sauce on the top. I would definitely have that again. Unfortunately, I couldn't eat more of the Jumbo Volcano because I gorged myself on the apps. We took the chocolate mousse dessert home (used our complimentary dessert coupon). It had fruit on the side and was filled with white chocolate. I could have eaten that one for days and was foiled when my husband decided to eat half...curses!! Anyways, I like the atmosphere and I think the prices are average. It looks like they also have reverse happy hour which is always a plus in my book!",

I will go with the sushi bell curve on this, and reluctantly provide a 4 click with my mouse.  Overall, I had a great experience at Kabuki. It was pleasant decor, good service, and the restaurant was quiet enough to talk, but no too quiet, where if you tell a story you feel like your giving a speech in an auditorium.  They have a great variety of menu items, and the prices are reasonable. Since it was the birthday dinner of my date, and sort of an impromptu meeting of people that didn't really know each other, this place turned out be pretty cool for a new group to get to know each other. We had a group of 7 people, and the service was pretty good I must say. The only mishap was the accidental dropping of a \"spider roll\" I proceeded to wonder, \"who's spider roll is this?\" Which got the table all singing \"spider roll, spider roll does whatever a spider roll can\" from which I quipped, \"oh this is just your friendly neighborhood spider roll.\" I can't help myself, when I can insert a Spiderman joke into  a situation, I just go for it.  From quotes like \"What the hell, where is the fresh Wasabi?\" To trying to determine what the mystery city in Japan was that one dinner guest wanted to travel to, we had fun. I've never wanted an iPhone more than this night, as topics ranged from music, to travel, to types of sushi.  I suggest Kabuki, for fun and games, tom foolery and shenanigans,  and  for sushi goers that don't take themselves too seriously.",

    "text": "Here is the first awful restaurant that compelled me to write a review, its from another website before I found this one. It's back from Nov. 2008 so who knows if things have changed, but me thinks not as to what I have heard..This restaurant was the worst I have been to for the price::  I usually never write reviews of restaurants unless I am moved to do so. My experience here was not pleasant and mistake after mistake compelled me. First off, I am a chef at a respectable restaurant in Tempe. I have also waited tables before at many restaurants. Our server completely forgot my drink order, I ignored that and just decided to forget about it. My cousin got an appetizer of mushrooms and other sauteed veggies that was pretty bland. What completely upset me is that our server brought out our sushi, teriyaki chicken and salads at the same time! So while I'm trying to enjoy my sushi my entree is getting cold and my salad was warm because it is plated next to the chicken. The albacore I got seemed to be seared on the edges, which isn't mentioned on menu, but it was very dry, not stored correctly. My philly roll was disgusting, I had to send it back The first time I had ever sent anything back. It just tasted not fresh and premade. My server didnt seem to care, not even a sorry, but a \"that's weird our fish is fresh everyday\", well it dont taste like it people! Also server had completely forgotten my soup, I had to remind twice, then finally ask for it to go(reminded again after the bill came). My teriyaki chicken was dry and the sauce wasn't so good, the sauce I requested to make it spicy was pretty unappetizing(My server forgot that too, had to remind) (maybe she was stoned?) I think Kyoto Bowl has better Spicy Teriyaki Chicken and even Ra has better sushi(crazy but True)  I wish I could say my drink was good, but alas! I NEVER got it.  ( I kept waiting and wouldn't say anything just to see if she remembered) I wouldn't waste my time here if you want good japanese food and sushi. Go to Ichiban, Sapporo, Stingray, Sushi Brokers, etc. This place blows! PLEASE PLEASE Tempe Marketplace get one GOOD restaurant here!",

Very soggy edemame, clam miso clams were chewy, and the sushi....I'm no sushi expert, but we ordered 3 different rolls and each tasted slightly sour and \"rank\". Even the ginger had a very sour aftertaste. To top off things, we only had water and my glass stayed pretty much empty despite the waitress promising to fill it up right away...three times. And they didn't bother to clear off the dirty drink glasses, something that should be rudimentary considering their drinks are over priced. Overall, poor service, poor food quality....obviously not the only ones thinking so, as the facility was more than half empty, which should have been a clear sign to stay away. DON'T EAT HERE!",

But it works in this crazy desert!  We like to try different places and while we were shopping at Tempe Market Place we thought that this might be a decent little place for some good ol' fashion rolls.  When we arrived it looked like your traditional hip cool martini/sushi bar. The hostess was very nice and sat us immediately. Pretty soon after the server arrived to take drink orders and my bro and I looked over the extensive list of rolls. I must say they have a pretty inventive list. One roll was called the brain (If memory serves me correctly) and it was a blob of fish mix and red sauce. Pretty gross to look at but not bad.  My only complaint with this place is the service (if you have read any of my reviews this is what will always get you in the end). After our server took our drinks, we really didn't see much of her till our bill. NOT a good impression to someone who has been in the industry since she was 16. The sushi was ok, nothing I would say my brother and I are dying to go back for. But if you are looking for more atmosphere and pretty people then quality...Kabuki is your place!",

We called in our order, I had ordered the Bar-B-Que rib and tempura combo and she ordred the Gold Rush Roll and Vegetable Roll. When she came back, hers looked amazing and mine, well, wasn't what I expected. It was SALMON! How the hell do you get salmon and bar-b-que rib mixed up. And also there wasn't any tempura sauce in the bag. Being pressed for time, I sat there and gagged down the dry salmon (teriyaki sauce did nothing for me) and tempura.

While this is not the trendiest sushi place, nor the cheapest, but it delivers decent quality seafood and better than average service. If your at tempe marketplace for whatever reason and want to grab a quick healthy bite to eat give this place a shot. Next time im going to try to make it for happy hour as they have good deals then.",

Food was pretty average, service was slow, all thought restaurant was half empty. My fiancee was drinking Sprite but server refill his glass with water, we had to ask 3 times for more ginger and wasabi, just little things that make you very annoyed and wanting to never go back. I hope that owner of this place will hire better employees or help existing employees work on their customer service skills. I would hate to see such a beautiful restaurant in such a great location to go out of business because of poor service.",

    "text": "We stopped by Kabuki on the way home from the Suns game a couple of weeks ago.  We weren't starving and wanted to try this place out, so we figured we'd give it a shot for a quick sushi fix.  The decor is somewhat typical trendy sushi bar - ultra modern and artsy - but pleasant nonetheless.  The music wasn't overly loud, and plasma televisions over the sushi bar were tuned to ESPN.  The place was relatively packed for an east valley restaurant at almost 11pm.  The crowd appeared to be mostly drinkers vs. eaters, as the noise level could attest; it felt more like a bar than a restaurant.  We sat at the sushi bar, and were disappointed to see that the sushi chefs were busily packing away and cleaning their stations for the evening.  Our server advised that last call would be in about 10-15 minutes.  We were unimpressed that we were not offered miso or edamame after we were seated.  The wait staff service was poor at both extremes -- painfully slow one moment, with the server hovering over us the next.  Our server brought menus and then stood and waited while we perused.  I told him we were just going to get sushi, so he insisted on taking our drink orders.  I ordered a Kirin and a glass of water (I didn't know how else to get rid of the guy!) and my companion (boyfriend sounds ridiculous at my advanced age) ordered sake and hot tea.  My beer was delivered quickly and cold, and then the server vanished.  The sake and tea didn't arrive until midway through our meal, after a second request.  Once I drained my water glass, it was never refilled, despite a request.  At the end of the meal we waited (and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited) for our check, and were finally able to snag our server to request the check as he flew past us.  This guy had only three modes:  anxious puppy (standing beside us with an expectant look on his face); falcon (flying past us at breakneck speed on his way to a mission); and invisible.  The sake list is nice, and quite extensive.  The menu is nearly intimidatingly (I don't think that's really a word) large, with both raw and cooked options.  The raw portion of the menu was adequate, though neither creative nor exciting.  We ordered toro sashimi, and for the money the portion was on the small side.  The normally buttery, smooth tuna belly was tough and chewy, a very unwelcome surprise.  We also ordered some nigiri and a couple of rolls.  The sushi was prepared quickly, and the chef was attentive enough to not toss everything at us at once, even though the evening clean-up process was well underway.  He presented the first couple of dishes, then waited a bit to bring forth more so that we weren't overwhelmed.  Each of the plates was presented beautifully.  The dishes themselves were very pretty -- they reminded me of sculpted ice.  The portions were smallish, but the fish was fresh.  The level of originality was about average, as was the taste.  The sushi prices were neither exorbitant nor cheap.  This overall dining experience can best be described as average, leaning heavily towards sub-par considering the wait staff service and unforgivable toro.  It dawned on me as we departed and were walking past the other patrons that we did not fit the target demographic for the restaurant.  Kabuki is a place geared towards a younger, Gen X type that is less interested in high quality dining and more interested in seeing and being seen.  This less-demanding patron is very satisfied with a chain-imposed menu.  He/she is happy eating California rolls made from \"crab\" with a K and drinking copious quantities of Grey Goose lychee martinis.  I'm not criticizing this demographic - it's just not my style.",

The gyoza, sushi and beef teriyaki were all fine but after my disappointment with the edamame, I can't seem to give this place better than a \"meh.\"",

    "text": "Hubby and I needed a pre-prom (chaperoning, that is) dinner, and the Tempe Marketplace was very close to the venue. He suggested the new Japanese place, and although I was hesitant about sushi in the desert, I agreed to go. The restaurant was pretty busy, but we were seated right away. The table still had a chunk of someone else's seafood on it- not a positive start. We ordered iced teas- Hubby's oolong tasted unusual- neither of us cared for it.   We decided to order the Love Boat (a 2-order minimum sampler platter, essentially) for about $18 a piece. Miso soup came first- it was hot but on the bland side. The came the boat- it was so huge I was a little embarrassed to have it on the table, and it turned out to be far too much food, even for 2 hearty eaters like ourselves. The tempura veggies and shrimp were quite fresh and tasty. In the California rolls, the crab was Krab, and pretty mushy. The dumplings were flavorful, but the meats-teriyaki chicken and beef ribs) were barely luke-warm when they came out. I found both to be on the tough side, but Hubby liked them anyway. The mussels were served on a half-shell and were smothered in a creamy cheesy sauce. Hubby hated it, mainly due to a texture issue, and I thought it was edible, but I probably wouldn't choose to again. Everything was layered on top of a bed of iceberg lettuce and tomato wedges which we didn't even end up touching. The fresh pineapple was a nice desserty finish. The service was fine, and the waitress was conscious of our time limits due to prom.   Hubby definitely wants to go back and I'm on the fence. Maybe for the tempura...",

I scoped out the menu had some some sushi for happy hour, including some rare beef sashimi, some unusual and unique rolls and complimentary edamame.  Although I did not dine here for a full meal, I feel justified in expressing my enjoyment of their happy hour.  The tiny bar was cozy and the service was good.  The happy hour prices were enticing and I would definitely return for it:)  Although for my personal taste the ambiance of Kabuki seemed a little too corporate for me I definitely would return for their happy hour and maybe to sample other menu items.  I will keep you posted on my next visit:)",

It just so happened that Eat Pray Love was playing at the Tempe Marketplace Harkins Theater, so we decided to meet at Kabuki before the movie.    I walked in first and asked how long the wait was for two... I as told 10 or 15 minutes.  Not so bad... so I decided to wait.  I walked outside and met up with my Alexa and we came back in about ten minutes later... As we did so, two other women came in and I saw that they were seated right away.  I looked at Alexa, looked up at the hostess stand, was thinking (WTF), and then went and asked nicely where we were on the list.    \"There are two tables before you,\" I was told.  \"It will likely be another ten minutes or so.\"   At that, I responded, \"is there another option, perhaps sushi bar, that I don't know about?\"  And alas, there sure was... (they neglected to give me that option when I originally checked-in).  We were seated at the sushi bar at that moment and went on to have a very underwhelming meal.  Here's why:  -While the large portion cucumber salads we ordered were extremely tasty, the cucumbers were cut lengthwise in such a way that it was difficult to eat.  I prefer cucumbers diced in smaller pieces so they are easier to eat!  -Service - our waiter wasn't the friendliest... I felt kind of rushed by him when we were there.  Additionally, since we were seated in the middle of the sushi bar, all of the wait staff would reach over us to pick up the sushi for their tables, which was very distracting while we were eating!  Perhaps they could've moved the sushi ready for pick-up to the side of the sushi bar to avoid distracting guests in the future?  -The sushi itself was good; not amazing.  We had a Sunset roll, a Lotus roll, a Large roll, and an order of Ikura.  I didn't realize the Lotus roll was going to have a ton of mayo along with the baked Lobster that came on top of it... it was a bit on the creamy side for my liking.  -To top things off, when the bill came, they overcharged us... a simple mistake, but given our experience, it was just one more negative thing... and then when I pointed it out, I barely got an apology at all.  With so many other restaurants to choose from in the Tempe Marketplace, I am not sure I'll return to Kabuki.  If I do, however, I will wait for a regular table!",

    "text": "I've been here a few times with family and friends and have enjoyed the dining experience each time.  Plenty of free parking since it's located within the Tempe Marketplace.  (It's right across the Barnes and Noble Bookstore.)  The most we've had to wait for a table (even on busy Friday and Saturday nights) was 30 minutes.  Even though it was a turnoff when I once overheard waiters discussing the amount of tips they hope to receive from customers, service was professional and efficient overall.   1)  Sea urchin sushi, aka Uni ($7.50 for two pieces) - I've had it twice at Kabuki and both times, the Uni has tasted fresh!  Uni is definitely an acquired taste, but man, is it good!  It's an explosion of flavors and textures... at first light and creamy, then sweet, and then briny.  I love having Uni with sake or their lychee martinis ($8.95).  2) Dragon Specialty Roll ($12.95 lunch / $14.95 dinner) - This is my favorite roll at Kabuki.  They are very generous with the eel pieces.  The roll is shaped like a \"dragon\" and the eel is so delicate it practically melted in my mouth!   3) Paradise Specialty Roll ($10.95 lunch / $12.95 dinner) - This roll is very pretty to look at, and even more delicious to eat!  The roll contains a mix of mango, smoked salmon, cream cheese, and a few other items within the roll.     4) Dynamite ($8.95) - Baked clam, scallop, mushrooms and other veggies in a mayo sauce.  The dynamite served here is just ok.  It was a bit on the salty side and I even tasted a hint of curry powder.    5) Seafood Yaki Soba ($9.95 / lunch) -Soba noodles stir-fried with shrimp/scallop/calamari & veggies in a brown sauce.  The dish had good flavor and the portion was generously sized.",

I also really appreciate the little bowl of edamame you get complementary when you sit down. I can't finish this post without saying that the fried ice cream is a must try. With three flavors of ice cream (vanilla, green tea, and coffee) you won't be disappointed.",

Seriously, pulling off great sushi in the Phoenix area seems like a great challenge... this place does a great job.  They're sometimes one of the only places that have toro in the area as well - a personal favorite.  You should ask though, because it's pretty rare.   Finally the mushroom miso soup is very very tasty and a nice way to kick off a visit.  I also recommend the sake based cocktails.",

I wish I never ordered the shiitake tofu mushrooms, they weren't even hot and the 'yuzu' sauce tasted like microwaved instant gravy .

    "text": "I've been going here since they opened at Tempe Marketplace. It's in my neighborhood, food has always been consistent..not stellar but over time we identified the things we felt they did best. I had a really poor meal there about a year ago and didn't return until this June..thinking I'd give it another try. New menu was promising, brought vegan relatives, lots of choices but it didn't take long for things to go south. They got the alcohol order wrong- and only three of us ordered drinks- we ordered appetizers and asked that they bring them first. A half an hour later ( with a toddler who wasn't happy not having food quickly- thus the appetizers ) our food arrived- ALL of it. We asked our server several times about the appetizers and were told she would check on it and then disappear for 15 more minutes. The worst part of a bad meal was a long dark hair on the tofu steak plate of my grandsons plate! After 5 minutes trying to flag the server the manager came over and agreed to comp the meal and replace it but our 2 year old was having none of it..we are at the 40 minute mark by then. I had ordered the same thing and gave him mine. I had already made a reservation for Fathers Day at this point. We did return..hubby and I and the scenario was repeated minus the hair. Drink orders wrong again and had to go back which took another ten minutes..20 minutes to even get a drink at 6pm..food was disappointing EXCEPT for the awesome spider roll. Everything else was screwed up..the server told me what came on the black cod plate and it didn't arrive that way. The Fathers Day special was a lot of food but some things were hot and others cold when they should have been hot. Sorry Kabuki..I want to love you but have spend $250 there in June and wish I had spent it someplace else!",

The Lotus on Fire roll was great.  Spicy and tasty.  Can't complain there.  The mint lemonade was also a nice tasty surprise.  There really wasn't much else beyond that.  The Yaki Soba was bland, and the calamari was overcooked and rubbery.  The shrimp tempura was tasteless, and the sauce that came with it had no flavor. And the miso soup was weak.  One of my colleagues ordered a plate of pickled veggies (I forgot what the dish was called).  It was mostly a pile of boring dill pickles, and a small spattering of other, more interesting vegetables.  What a ripoff.  Our bill?  $25 apiece.  A little ridiculous considering the quality of food.  They seem to have a motif at Tempe Marketplace: it fits right in with its neighbors, Lucille's and Maria Maria, with its artsy-fartsy decor and disappointing, overpriced food.",

I am a huge ramen-lover and try it whenever I can wherever I can so I consider myself fairly well-versed in the ramen-tasting world. However, it's been a long while since they've watered down the recipe (literally).  I've asked for them to thicken the broth several times and wind up with half-the amount of soup that would normally be served or the same watered down version.  I've gone back several times in hope that these were just flukes but no....  This was just sad and disappointing.  For what would have been a really nice restaurant this just left me feeling cheated.    The rest of the menu is pretty decent for a somewhat americanized sushi restaurant.  I must admit, their happy hour has very good prices for their sushi.  Their alcoholic beverages are not bad either,  the shochu that i've tried is quite good!  If you've ever had shochu in Japan, you know how incredibly amazing the drinks are and although this is definitely not at the same level, it is the closest I've found in the states.",

The spicy tuna roll was extremely sloppy and the fish was not very fresh in any way, shape, or smell.  The next day I ate at Pacific Seafood Buffet and the fish was better there.... and lunch buffet is only $8.39 or so.  I used the yellowtail nigiri from there to compare the fish and I wanna say that the buffet's fish was actually more palatable.   If  that's the fish they're serving, the prices really need to reflect the quality.  This is one of those places that you should probaly only get the rolls at because the sauces and other crap cover up the actual taste of the fish.    I will admit their hot food is pretty good... I'd give that 4 stars...  and it seems they have a very extensive cocktail, sake, and shochu menu.  The service was good, even though we had a 2 year old eating rice and miso with his bare hands (thus throwing rice grains all over the place).  Summary: 1. crappy nigiri and sashimi 2. decent hot foods 3. good service for families",

I met a friend there after going to see the early showing of Avatar, which by the way was fabulous but that is for another review.  They had a special menu for game day inwhich anything that was on this list, you buy one and you get the next item for $1. Not too shabby considering it was about 12:30 or so on a Sunday and its hard to find a happy hour that early on a Sunday (do they even exist?)  Our waiter Ryan was very patient and he backed me up when I was trying to explain to my friend some of the \"safe rolls\" as he is still a sushi novice. (Poor thing doesn't realize what he is missing)  We ordered Kirin, Philly Roll, Lotus Roll (which was topped with lobster yummy) Cucumber roll, Salmon roll, Unagi, Sweet Shrimp, Baked Scallop Roll - whew. (Hey this is from the girl who goes to all you can eat sushi, what did you expect?) I think my friend got a nice easy intro into sushi. I mean he eats it from time to time, but I need to get home onto bigger and better things.  At any rate, the sushi was very good. The lotus roll, the baked scallop roll, and my unagi were of course my favorites. I love my unagi! I tried to get my friend to try it and he did try an ity bity bit. He said it was ok but I am not too sure. He did eat the shrimp which was pretty impressive but trying to see him get the tail off was pretty funny. However he did it in a very dignified way so kudos for him. Needless to say I stuffed myself as usual but its Sushi!!! I love sushi. Enough said.  It was a very cute restaurant and not crowded, but then again it was a Sunday afternooon and I am not sure people know about their game day special. Again kudos to Ryan for the excellent service he provided.  I will definitely have to try Kabuki again if I am ever on that side of town. All in all it was a very good Sunday afternoon with a great friend.",

First, it's no big deal to have to wait. Even on a Thursday night we understand a large party of 5 couples and some kids will have to wait a bit. That didn't bother me but waiting for a table that could comfortably fit 10 with chairs on the corners is kinda sad. The dining room was half empty. There were empty tables all around us and no other large parties. After trying to fit into the table(with one chair short) and realizing our elbows were in each other's sides only sitting there, I asked the host if there was any possible way to add a table. She came over and added one, not sure why they couldn't just do this to begin with but I give them the benefit of the doubt.  The food was good, not the best I've tasted and definitely a bit pricey but the Poke Tuna I got was fresh, it was drowning in a pool of some sort of sauce was strange but helped cut the spicy so I liked it. My husband enjoyed his Ramen, the broth was very good actually. Everyone else seemed to like their meals, despite the fact that the server felt the need to explain everything as if they might change their minds. This also happened when we ordered coffee, it was as if she thought if we knew it was a french press we wouldn't want it. Because of this it did take a very long time for us to get it. When I was brought mine she told me she would have to come back in a minute to press it down for me since it wasn't ready yet. After a few minutes and no sign of her I did it myself and had to tell her when she did come over and apologize that I was familiar with french press coffee and could handle it. The overall dinner service definitely dragged.  The most awkward part of the night came at the end when we were waiting for our checks after explaining we really truly didn't need dessert.(They brought ice cream with a candle for my 26 yr old brother anyway). A large group was seated near us and it seemed they had the same dilemma of too many people for too small of a table. They stood there very near us as a host and server gestured at our table and after a couple minutes walked them back to the front. A few minutes later(while we were still waiting on checks, nothing we could do to try to give up our table and believe me too many of us have worked in the service industry to be table hogs), they were brought back in and shown that the host had set up another table for 6 right next to the original table they were given. More gesturing and stink eyes shot in our direction, then the party went back out front and their original table was expanded to be longer. I'm not sure what the deal is with this place but large parties really shouldn't be that hard to figure out. Especially on a slow Thursday night.   We may try this place again for Happy Hour sushi but this trip just didn't do much for me considering we spend $40 without any sushi or alcoholic drinks. I wouldn't recommend this place for a large party unless you really enjoy sitting on each others laps and having the pace of meal drag because your sole server is obviously overwhelmed not to mention doesn't have much faith in the product.",

    "text": "Some friends suggested Kabuki for a friendly meet-up dinner. They come often for the Beef Yakisoba. The location is in the Tempe Marketplace, and is almost always booming - especially on weekends. We came at 5pm, and luckily had no wait. We were seated and given menus and water. We first ordered drinks. The boys had beer, and we ladies had strawberry Sakeritas. To me, the drink was very weak...a watered-down slurpee had more flavor. The rim was barely sugared, and you couldn't at all taste the sake.  The server takes our orders. Let's get on a small soapbox for a moment. When serving, is it no longer common practice to take the orders from, and serve the ladies first? Call me old fashioned, but this is the right way to serve, and it irks me when we have to almost force it upon the server. She's looking at Mr. P to order, but he is saying \"[Mrs. H], please go ahead\". Then, the server asks if we want to receive our meals together, or as they are ready. Huh? The kitchen should time the preparation so a ticket is served together. I'm verklempt. Mr. & Mrs. H order their beef soba favorite, and are pleased. Mr. P ordered a sashimi and tempura plate. The plate was pretty, and had various seafood on glass noodles, with rice and tempura vegetables. He thought it was mediocre. He did enjoy the larger slices of octopus, and even shared with me! It was chilled and not at all rubbery. I enjoyed it as well. I ordered the tofu steak and a side of ika geso karrage. The batter did not stay well on the octopus, which was quite chewy and salty. The spicy sauce it was served with was the better part of the plate. The two round tofu patties were soggy, and were covered with a pleasant sweet teriyaki glaze. The shiitake and asparagus complement, as well as the little pats of brown rice, were lovely. The mixed green salad was good, with a sweet and tangy light dressing. The miso soup had a decent flavor, but was cold. Our server didn't check on us often, and the boys were out of drinks for a good part of the meal. My water was refilled once. On top of it all, the server incorrectly split the checks, but we didn't dare to bring it up, juat so we could get out of there. This is not my first choice for Japanese, and I won't likely return.",

Was in the Tempe Marketplace area and got a craving so decided to check out Kabuki for their Tonkotsu ramen specifically.   It was good! Maybe not the most authentic, but it hit the spot. I got two nice thick pieces of chashu which were tasty and filling - good thing because the ramen doesn't come with any other toppings, unfortunately. If they added an egg to this dish, it would definitely make it feel more complete as a ramen. The broth looked nice and milky with a decent flavor, and I thought the noodles were cooked well - good amount of spring and chew.  I've had sushi rolls here as well and maybe thats where Kabuki really shines but their ramen is not bad at all!",

Since I've moved away, it's hard getting myself to Tempe marketplace but I'm so glad that my boyfriend and I decided to stop into Kabuki, because we were happily stuffed after dining here! I think we found my boyfriend's new favorite restaurant. It was a treat eating here and I honestly think it's gotten so much better. The staff was super friendly and attentive. I kept things simple and ordered a miso soup, muscled, & the Las Vegas roll. It wasn't my favorite miso soup, or muscles... but that's because I like my muscles plain and they definitely spiced the muscles up with additional flavors that I could've lived without. The Las Vegas roll was easily one of my favorites. DELICIOUS. Meanwhile, my boyfriend ordered the rest of the menu it seemed lol the portion sizes are fantastic so the pricing really does make sense. I believe he spent $17 on one roll. Expensive but well worth it given his entire dish was filled with thick and flavorful eel. We also ordered the banana Mochi as dessert. No regrets ;) Definitely check out Kabuki if you're in the mood for seafood / sushi!!",

We were sat at a table with no light which was fine but Alyssa was not pleased that I pointed that out. Luckily our server understood the situation and took care of it. Also the food here is good and unfortunately I took a star off due to the attitude of Alyssa. Katie is amazing and hopefully I will have her again. It seemed like she had a lot on her plate while we were waiting for our food and the other staff were not as attentive as she is. I had to come back to finish this after we ate and had to change a couple of things. The food took awhile to come and our server Katie had to remind them about our rolls. You could tell once we received the rolls that they were rushed and falling apart. My friends roll had to be sent back because of the amount of mayo they put on her favorite roll that she gets when she comes here. Again Katie was very helpful but I'm not sure how I feel. Not a good impression on my part luckily Katie was there.",

We waited for the server to retrieve the rest of our order but only observed our waiter talking with the hostess.   He returned after 3 of us had finished what we had first received of our order to ask if we needed refills for our drinks. We asked about the remaining part of our order. The waiter then went into the kitchen and returned with another portion of our order, at least all the people in our party had part of their order now.   Then the waiter left saying he would check on the order. Another waiter then came to our table bringing the last of our order. We then waited again for someone to arrive to give me the check.   The first waiter returned with the check which was on an electronic tablet where the waiter hands it to you to type in your desired tip in front of them and then sign. The waiter was not pleased being that even if the kitchen was slow, a little communication and less flirting with the hostess would have helped.",

The waiter was very knowledgable on gluten free options. They also have an extensive amount of vegetarian options.   The service here was great. The food was also good, I gave only 4 stars instead of 5 because the food didn't stand out to me any more than other sushi places I've been. I ordered the ramen veggie soup and a Philadelphia roll. The food came out rather quickly. There is a free edamame appetizer with any sushi order which was a pleasant surprise.",

Came here on a date long time ago and just thought it was an overpriced sushi joint but I just recently went here with family and had a whole new experience.  Venture outside the sushi even though the sushi are very good! After tasting sushi from multiple restaurant, I gotta say the price of the sushi here is worth it :) 1 or 2 roll will get you full.   Other foods here are good too. Love their garlic edamame and seaweed salad. The sesame chicken is different but in a good way [: The yakisoba was okay and the seafood udon was unexpected cause you want an asian flavour but get a cajun instead. The soupy noodles were better though. Love the cha sui ramen and the spicy udon noodles.    Service was excellent! took forever to be seated but it was expected because we came in when the waiters were switching shifts but they didnt hover and came back periodically to make sure we got everything we need. We definitely will be back soon to try out other foods on their menu.",

    "text": "Kabuki is among my top sushi places.  I like to go here with the girls for a ladies night, followed by shopping and a movie.  Of course I get my favorite, the spicy tuna.  We have start the meal with the Tokyo Quesadilla. This is an appetizer that consists of fried wonton skins, mozzarella cheese, and baja tomato salsa.  It is a perfect starter, but be sure to use the salsa.  We usually end up eating our first piece fast so we can beat the rest to a second helping.  Most importantly you must try the mint Sakerita.  We don't know what is it in per se, but it is cool and refreshing and perfect for a hot Arizona day.  Not that it needs to be hot out, as I like it anytime of the year.  If you're not into sake, the Tokyo Mule is a great alternative, the ginger beer is a good compliment to the sushi itself.  We rarely wait for a table, but the bar tends to be fairly packed.  They do not have TVs in the dining area, so if you're in the mood to catch the big game you need to sit in the bar.  Kabuki is one of the little gems that Tempe Marketplace has to offer and will ensure you start your shopping experience on the right note.",

Our food was delicious ( I got a couple rolls and my husband got the teriyaki chicken ) and the service was one star away from being amazing. The food came out very quickly and for how busy they were I was impressed. They must work like a well oiled machine! I ordered a sake bomb and never ran out of what I needed, beer or sake, however my husband had to ask a few times for his soda to be refilled. Which he drinks a lot of soda and fast so refills are needed quite frequently. Our waiter brought my stuff and forgot his soda, so while my husband was distracted by the dessert menu I pointed to his soda when the waiter asked if there was anything else I needed beside the sake he brought me. He nodded and said oh yea. Which is fine. But then he took two other tables orders and my husband just watched him waiting for his soda. So about 5 minutes later he got his soda. So over all food and service was great. Just gotta hit those steps of service. It was my birthday and everything went perfect for me so I'm not complaining!",

Beyond beautifully prepared and presented dishes, our server was Marisa, who made the meal extra special. She greeted us with a huge smile, like she was having great fun herself! She was extra helpful to us in navigating the multi-page menu and answering questions about the various dishes. We took advantage of her helpfulness and willingness to teach us about good combinations of dishes, helped by our arriving early before Marisa got busier with other tables to tend.   Among our amazing dishes were edamame in the pods, avocado roll, tofu sushi roll with wasabi sauce and fresh ginger slices to cleanse our pallets between bites, mountain carrots about the diameter of a No. 2 pencil, plump udon noodles also about the diameter of a No. 2 pencil in a delectable soup with steamed vegetables, and all accompanied by large cups of hot green tea with lemon. The meal was simply superb and sublime.   So thanks to Kabuki and especially to Marisa of their fine staff for making this stop near our new home in the desert so memorable!  After so many fine and unusual dishes, we were delighted to learn that our tab was a pleasant, affordable surprise.   We of course plan to return there in the future. Hats off to Kabuki and Marisa!",

The people with negative reviews on here don't know the first thing about sushi... They're also recommending RA as one of the best places to get sushi... I rest my case. Kabuki offers tons of really original stuff. The Baja roll is a spicy crab roll with pico de gallo on top--so good and refreshing. The hamachi box sushi is one of my favorites of all time. Sort of wish the edamame was warm rather than cool, but that's a personal thing.",

I'm always use to eatting at Saketini or Ra Sushi.  I ordered Calamari as an appetizer, I was not a big fan of the deep fried...I've had better. However their dark dipping sauce was delicious!!!! It had a kick of chili in it, exactly what it needed.   The shrimp tempura and Lotus roll,  The Lotus roll was good, a little too seafoody for me...I loved the lobster but I just couldn't bare the smell (Dumb huh? I'm only in a sushi place) but whatever my body is weird like that. Haha  Dillon was our waiter, I kept giving him a hard time but it was all good fun, He was great!

So my suggestion would be to sit at an actual table, so you're not disregarded.   The sushi was good but wouldn't say it was great for the money spent. A lil bland and the pieces were few. I've been to a good amount of sushi spots in the valley both 'commercial' and divey locations and this really missed the target all together on customer service and presentation.

I had the california roll (crazy I know) and the mixed tempura appetizer, both of which were really good and not expensive at all (the food alone was ~$11). Add a drink and the tip and tax for a large group and it turned out to be a little pricy of a meal, but the restaurant has a really cool vibe and it was definitely an enjoyable experience.",

The presentation is always nice, the food is always decent and the service is always just so-so. Kabuki isn't a place I go to regularly, its a place I go to if it's convenient. I have only been to the Tempe location this one time, and while I normally would not review a place where I only ordered a drink, I feel compelled to review my experience here. I met up with some friends here the other night to get a drink before going to see Eat, Pray, Love. I walked in the door and was completely ignored by the host. I walked into the bar where my friends were and ordered a drink. The bartender was completely unfriendly. The only words he said to me was \"Here you go\" when he handed me my drink. That's it. He didn't even ask to take my order, he just walked up to us and stood there until I placed my drink order. A few minutes after he brought me my drink he brought out my friend's sushi roll and walked away. Just the roll. No soy sauce dish,  no wasabi, no ginger. He never came back except to drop off the bill. We paid and left.",

Yea, its nice, but it didn't seem like anything special. My experience was probably ruined by the fact that it was all just open space. By open space, I mean, there weren't any walls dividing the room's ambiance. It felt like a high school cafeteria, as far as noise went. The menu wasn't surprising as far as pricing went and the pricing was roughly $23 per person if you get water. Figuring, I'm supposed to be paying for all this \"ambiance\", I was disappointed. So, I decided, its the food that must supplement the value of the cost. Yea, I'd have to admit, the food was tasty, but so is most sushi from places like this. Nothing special here, which is why I can't rate it very high.  Food: Tasty, Normal Ambiance: Lame, felt like I was at a buffet (I said \"like\")  Other details: Hmm, we reserved a table, but when it came time to sit, we were given a table very tiny. The plates were so overly-sized, we had to laugh about it. I didn't mean to be rude to the waitress about mentioning the restaurants comparison to TGIF. This is reference to how they were singing birthday songs, as others in that class do. I come to a sushi joint to get a feel of authenticity of Japanese cuisine, not another americanized potential food-chain with expensive lighting.",

The edamame were great, but the calamari had waaaay too much batter on them, they were more like the calamari you get at an Italian American place than a japanese restaurant. I ordered this whole meal full of several different types of sashimi and half of a spicy tuna roll. My son ordered a california roll and a few shrimp tempura, wifey had the jumbo volcano and a philly roll. My plate was good, great selection of pretty legit fresh sashimi. My son wasn't a fan of his cali roll. The wife seemed to like the volcano and her roll. Overall, everything was pretty good. It wasn't knock my socks off good and a bit too commercial for my taste. The food was decent. Memorable? nope. Would I go back? If I was invited or with a group than probably, but I'm not sure I'd select it again on a whim. Overall, this place gets a Meh + from me",

We placed our order about 3-5 minutes prior to the start of happy hour (after waiting about 30 minutes to be seated). When it was time to pay, our check did not reflect the happy hour prices. Our waitress was new and she admitted that she forgot to wait to put in the order after happy hour had started. She obviously couldn't do anything about it so I asked to talk to her manager. This is when I became beyond disillusioned with this restaurant. The manager (Ashley) was beyond rude. She actually said it was OUR fault for sitting before happy hour had started. She was very condescending. I really could not believe she was the manager. I am very disappointed. Sadly, I will not be going back.",

The yellow tail, spicy tuna, and regular tuna rolls were very good though with a good fish to rice ratio. I'm picky about these things. Thanks.",

The quality of the fish is excellent and the portions of the dishes are very good.  Some of our favorites are the pyramid roll, fried tofu, sesame chicken, the \"Ninja Deluxe\" lunch specials and their calamari.  This place is one of our family favorites!",

Add in a Babies 'R' Us and you'd hit the slit-my-wrists trifecta.  Kabuki would probably get three stars from me if it weren't located in the midst of this fakey-fake \"urban experience\" mall bullshit. But it is, so it doesn't.  Plus, they make their iced tea with tap water and it tastes like shit.   But coworkers looooove lunching at Tempe Marketplace. It's close to the office, and it's easy to drive and park there (never mind that we could walk to Mill Ave.) So OK, fine. I'm game, unless it's Maria Maria.  I've been here twice -- once for lunch and once for happy hour. Well, we tried to go for happy hour. It ends at 6:00. Fuck you, too, Kabuki. I work too late for that bullshit.   Next time I'll just go to Ra, where I might get severely injured eardrums from the ear-splitting club music bullshit. But at least they have cheap HH prices 'til 7:00. And they're on my drunk bus route home.",

So my friend and I decided to try Kabuki as an option to the latter. When we walked in my first impression was this place was alot more open, brighter and better decorated than RA and BW. It had no smell which is a great sign.   I went out of my usual realm of Hamachi Sashimi and Uni. I actually ordered an entree for the first time at a sushi joint. I want to tell you that what I had was a 5 star dish. I am a Sucker for chilean sea bass. It's buttery, flaky, holds flavor well and tastes absolutely deliciuos. This place did not fail to impress. I loved the freshness. It was cooked PERFECT and the sauce was out of this world. One of the best Sea Bass dishes I have ever had and I have eaten this dish all over the country! If you love Chilean Sea Bass do not pass this up. It is my guarentee you will be shocked that a corporation could create such a flavourfull dish!!",

Though a little pricey, you get what you pay for from hot seafood dishes, to cold sushi platters, Kabuki has it... The ambiance has more of a dressy casual posh feel and is good for groups. One thing that is holding me from adding another star is that the sushi seems to be a super cold, like its been thawed. But, other than that, it tastes good. Try it out...",

In my experience, it seems this restaurant, like so many others, advertises gluten free options, but the preparation is not safe for those with celiac disease who must avoid gluten for health reasons -- not for a fad diet reasons. I went to Kabuki on 7/14/15 for HH with friends. Prior to going, I called ahead to speak with the staff about how foods were prepared in a safe way for celiacs. The staff member said all the right things, but that's the only happy part of this story. The first bad sign was that my server had never heard of gluten, and he looked unconcerned when I asked him to ask the chef to prepare my roll with a clean knife and cutting board and bamboo mat to avoid cross-contamination. And apparently that didn't happen, because I got very sick afterwards. The food always tastes good, and the HH is cheap, but it's not worth the short-term pain and perhaps long-term health ramifications if you're a celiac.",

When we asked for reccommendations on rolls she pointed to about ten different rolls going..this is good this is good etc etc...lol. We ended up ordering a lot of food and most od it was delicious. The flavors were great. One roll we had , Ifelt like the fish hada bad smell so I let someone know...he argued with me ...he said well we get it in every day, and we put vinegar on it..then he looks at my husband and says...what about you sir what do you think?!

I would definitely head to Old Town Scottsdale or North Scottsdale where I think the sushi is better for the price. Kabuki is pretty expensive, but I would guess it has to be based on it's prime location at Tempe Marketplace. The service is great and the selection of food outside of sushi is large as well. They definitely cater to a variety of tastes so if you aren't in the mood for sushi you can still find great food to satisfy you. If you're in the area or shopping at Tempe Marketplace I highly recommend Kabuki.",

So, the first thing that sets me off is the fish smell when I walk in the door - not good to sour the stomach of this midwestern girl turned sushi lover with the smell of pond and old fish. I won't waste your or my time with obtuse banter so here is the rundown:  - Atmosphere: typical black and red Japanese decor  - Bathrooms: cool stone sinks that drip and slosh water on your feet so be aware  - Sashimi: overpriced, so-so quality, served in a glass bowl over ice  - Rolls: underwhelming  - Calipico soda: fabulous  - Deserts: yummy but small  - Birthday celebrations: abundant and noisy with little tambourines that lit up",

Mmkay let's get started.  I was craving some warm udon soup but it was already 9 at night so I wasn't sure where to find some.  Somehow I remembered Kabuki from the Marketplace so the bf and I gave them a call. Lucky me, even on a Wednesday night, they were closing at 1030, whoo hoo.  We were happy to find out reverse hh was going on, they have this deal: buy one, get the second for $1. Genius.  I ordered Tempura udon, we also ordered some appetizers off the hh menu, we got gyoza and sesame chicken.  The bf ordered two rolls :pyramid roll and the kabuki roll. We also had salmon and tuna sushi.  Udon: It was really good, I mean I was craving it so it hit the spot.  I thought the portion looked kind of small but I was stuffed.  They also had a nice variety of tempura yum.  The Rolls:  Honestly..I would pass.  The rolls all sounded amazing but nothing really wowed me.  I would definitely choose the pyramid roll over the kabuki roll but if I was there for hh, I would actually pick a simpler roll off the hh menu and be perfectly satisfied.  The sushi: I did not have any of this but the bf this mention the salmon was extremely fresh.  He did not say anything about the tuna, which means it was just meh  The appetizers: YUM. Money  well spent really.  the portions were a lot bigger than any Japanese restaurant I've been  and they were on hh!!!!  Now, like I said I don;t think I would actually come for sushi but other Japanese foods. And try and make it out for hh!",

They are California rolls with raw tuna over the top and some sort of delicious sauce. Also, the Philly rolls are amazing. They also give you edamame beans, which are tasty !   Price: 4  stars - So, in comparison to likes of Ra sushi, Kabuki's price's are amazing. Regular rolls are 4-6 dollars for 6-8 rolls and around 9 dollars for 6 specialty rolls.   Atmosphere: 4 stars- The restaurant is decorated in a modern, and artistic fashion.   Service: 2 stars- The servers at Kabuki are not attentive what so ever, once they get your order it seems like simply forever until you finally receive your food. Once, you finally do they will not give you the time of day from there on out. In fact, one time our server completely deserted us and a different server came and brought us our check. They never even asked how the food was. They spend more time talking to each other then tending to the customers.",

That was my only complaint about the goods. The beef was cooked really well. My boyfriend and I shared a beef, tempura, and sashimi platter which came with rice, salad, and soup. The kabuki sushi special was very good and I recommend it!   Drinks: good with a decent price. My sakerita was prepared a little sloppy with the sugar on the outer glass wall rather than the rim.   Service: I think we lucked out, because our server wasn't as great as the other servers we saw around us. She took a while to give the wasabi we requested, which meant we didn't take our first bite into our sushi until 10-15 minutes after we finally got it. It also took a while for her to pick up our card, considering we wanted to leave for other plans.   Ambience: It's casual and not well lit. There are so many sitting options: inside, outside, table, booth, and sushi bar.   Wait Time: We waited less than 30 minutes to be seated on a Saturday night around 6.   Parking: It's at Tempe Marketplace, so there are a lot of stalls, but it usually gets full since there are a lot of restaurants, however it shouldn't take more than 15 minutes to find parking.

HOWEVER, you just need to know what to order and decide if it's worth it. My favorite rolls that I'm always willing to pay top dollar for are:  Lotus on Fire roll Lotus roll Volcano  I'm accustomed to sushi in HAWAII, and I've got to say their spicy tuna is on pay with the island.

    "text": "Went there with friend last Friday, around 12 pm. Asked for a booth, to what hostess replied that they are not available and seated a tiny square table. When we asked the server, Tina, if we could be seated to the booth, she mumbled that it was not possible. During our visit, there were at least FIVE unoccupied booths.   We were so hungry, so we decided to stay. Got two Kabuki Deluxe lunch sets for which we had to wait for a long time. Marinated beef was okay, not the very best I've tried. In the menu, it contained \"shrimp and vegetable tempura\", I wish I knew that it means only one piece of shrimp tempura. Tempura was overly greasy and tasteless, both shrimp and vegetables.  Service was horrible, and not only because of the seating. Server was saying something to us and leaving before heard the response. She didn't even ask if we needed forks and knives for meat and salad!",

The ochazuke is a little heavy on the broth side, but still light and lovely. My husband is a fan of the tonkatsu and soboro bowl, they always hit the spot.",

She got our drink and food order then disappeared. Someone else brought our food out, Marisa did not check on us, and halfway through eating she dropped off our check and we didn't see her again. We waited with our cards out for another 10 minutes and thankfully randy came over and cashed us out. The food was amazing as always, but the service was terrible. I'm a server, I understand if its busy its hard to get to everyone quick, but there was not many tables in the dining room so there was no excuse.",

    "text": "This place is big and popular seemingly might be more professional compare to some of the smaller family owned restaurants however it's funny how they can't seem to distinguish the difference between their regular sushi roll (the standard stuff on the menu) and a \"hand roll\" sushi roll. Hand roll  are more like an appetizer order for 1 person no sharing like other appetizers. So Stopped by one night since it opens late, haha on the bill they charged 13 dolla for 2 pieces of sushi 1 piece of avocado and 2 spoonful of rice wrapping in a piece of seed weed. Nice! But The best part is since they are bigger chain restaurants like that... I Don't think they give a damn whether they treat their customers right let alone minding about losing any customer. My Server wasn't even nice and friendly. If I was that server I would pay attention to small stuffs like that and make sure my customer don't get rip off. Unless you don't want your tip money but I think people tip you more if they know you are looking out for them. Anyway still leave them tip just didn't wanna ruin anybody night. Well play Kabuki!",

    "text": "It must be sushi week for me, as this was my second helping in 4 days. I met a friend here for lunch after a morning at the movies. I used to visit Kabuki frequently when I first started working in my current position, but then a group of friends reported not feeling well after a visit and I had not returned in the year since then. Upon further review, I seem to have forgotten to include that side note when recommending to my friend that we eat there. My bad.    We arrived about 12:30 on Sunday. We discovered the menu indicating select items were on sale during Cardinal game days. By one item from a section of the menu at regular price and another item in that section was $1. Good news - the Cardinals were playing (well, at least they suited up for the game), but I digress...as you may have seen from prior reviews of mine, I am limited in my sushi knowledge. I went for the comfort zone and ordered the Philadelphia roll. I can't really tell you what we had - I do remember to Kiren beer, the Philly roll, a lotus roll, something with scallops...something else...I can't forget her eel (which I reluctantly tried a teenie tiny corner of, but really it wasn't bad.  The restaurant has a nice appearance. Very comfortable and spacious. It was not crowded at all, which made for a nice dining experience. The waiter was very cool, gave us time to review the menu and provided excellent service.    I am still not sure what I ate, but I was in good hands with our waiter and my dining partner. I would totally trust her recommendations any time - unless she made me eat that whole eel. Then I might have to reconsider...It was an enjoyable afternoon and I will definitely return to Kabuki again.",

I rarely write bad reviews because opinions vary and everyone has their own taste, so just because I don't like the food at a restaurant doesn't mean I should put them down. However, this goes beyond that. I went there with my girlfriend last Friday. Since that day, we have been extremely sick! I don't want to go into details, to avoid grossing anybody out, but it hasn't been pretty. I'm worried it's food poisoning and we haven't been able to eat anything without it staying down. We don't have health insurance and can't afford going to see a doctor. I called them to see about getting a refund for the 80 dollars spent there and they just said sorry no refunds and hung up on me. You get us sick and can't even compensate that by giving us our money back? This has been horrible.",

During that visit, I had the company of friends and that lended itself favorably to enjoying that experience. Tonight, with another group of good friends, I rekindled the love affair that is Kabuki.   First, I must say that Tempe Marketplace is an amazing venue and, in and of itself, deserves respect for culminating such an amazing atmosphere. Kabuki fits in swimmingly with this notion. Impressive service, high-quality sushi and a stellar happy hour make this a very coveted destination. I look forward to returning, even if it's off the light rail path.

This time, it wasn't HH, so I ventured to the lunch menu.  If you know me at all from Yelp, then you know I quest for two things. Nachos and ramen.  This place had ramen. I got it.  Funny thing is, the waiter kept trying to get me to change my mind.  It was odd. \"Sir, you know this is a soup. Not many people realize that\"... \"I'll put in your order, but let me know if you change your mind\"... \"Not many people like the flavor of the broth, do you want me to bring you our 7 spice to add to it?\"... I was scared to eat it before I even saw it!!!  Needless to say, when it came, I taste tested with him standing there and he seemed surprised that I thought it was tasty. Don't doubt a True ramen fan, sir. Do not! Anywho... Melissa got the teriyaki chicken, and I nibbled a little off of it (it was good)...  a 3-star performance, but a 4-star ramen dish. I DO wish I could get my hands on some of that 7 spice though. It was awesome!!!!",

They have a happy hour AND a reverse happy hour almost every day, so it's impossible not to get great food for a great deal.

    "text": "I have been here numerous times and I have to say this time around I was actually disappointed. The waiter was slammed and could not handle his section so everyone, including us, received poor service. I saw a lady actually walk around the restaurant trying to find someone to give her check and card to in order to pay.  So back to our experience... Two of the items we received were wrong, thankfully a manager fixed one of them and the other was fixed by a completely different waiter. We did not not even receive one of the items we ordered, yet it ended up on our bill. When we pointed it out the waiter laughed it off like it was nothing before we insisted upon him to fix it.   But the event that takes the cake on this one was when I found something in my food. I had ordered the eel and cucumber roll with eel sauce and gotten through 4 of the 6 pieces when I looked down and saw a small thing sticking out of one of the pieces... A bone! Now being a chef myself I know when it is possible to get bones in your food (when you order a bone in steak or pork chop, etc).  Also I understand that there is always the chance of bones in certain fish dishes.   The part that vexed me most was the server's response and reaction when I attempted to point out the bone in my sushi. On a side note, I have NEVER seen a bone in sushi before in my life. He did not look phased what so ever. He stated that with eel it is quite common for this to happen. Then he went on to state that I could actually eat it!!! What the heck?? Is this guy crazy?? He dd not even apologize. I have NEVER had a server tell me to just eat a bone I just found in my food. I could not believe my ears. I will probably still come to eat here because I really enjoy the happy hour and the food. However, I will be on the look out for the dumbest and most insensitive server I've ever met and steer clear on his section...",

Our server was great, attentive, friendly and even let us put in a couple rolls a few minutes after happy hour had ended. So I'd give the service and menu 4/5 stars easily. Unfortunately the meal itself was underwhelming. The sushi came out kind of room temperature, which is a little disconcerting when eating raw fish. We also got an order of beef yakisoba. The beef was tough, chewy and I could taste that it had been cooked on a gas grill that was too hot. I swear it tasted like what propane/gas grills smell like. Weird. Over all I would probably come back for drinks and apps on happy hour but unfortunately that's about it.",

Then ALOT of time passed and still no food..... when someone else in our group checked in again, we were told they were still preparing it. It was a poke bowl. What is there to prepare??? I finally gave up and said never mind. They did offer a free dessert but were on it with charging for my cocktail. What is the most irritating thing is not once did a manager come by. I'm sure she was aware there was an issue, at least she should have been when the server asked to comp desert and remove the charge for my dinner.",

But I recently visited and noticed they changed their menu, looked more authentic! So as skeptical as I am ( I've avoided kabuki for 3 years after the last visit)  I ordered few of their menu.  I was really wowed by amount of japanese izakaya menu they added and I had the tebasaki ( Japanese flavored chicken wings).  It really really tasted like the ones in Japan!  And I had their sea urchin udon which wasn't the best but was ok.    Kids meal sushi plate really is presented like they do kids meal in Japan (minus a toy) !   I was getting really impressed than I read that Japanese Chiefs are improving their menu on yelp, no wonder !  They even have ochazuke and stuff.i hope they add more authentic iZakaya stuff so I don't have to goto Vegas for ichiza anymore.   :). And kids meal is totally worth it for little young sushi lovers ! My kid loves!",

Not a place I would go to for sushi or for a great Happy Hour Menu, they both suck here, I would not mind stopping in for udon. They don't have the most authentic of flavors and the prices does not match the quality but the udon is decent. I got the Spicy Seafood Udon Pasta last time and Joyce had the Uni Crab Udon Pasta. My dish had good heat, a mixture of mussels and shrimp, barely any scallop or squid, and a modest serving of udon. If it was not for the side salad and the soup Joyce made me get, I would still have been hungry. Joyce seemed to enjoy her Uni Crab Udon Pasta. It had good crab flavor but the cooked uni did not lend the dish any uni flavor.   I will only be back when Joyce makes me. We had ordered takeout through Yelp and everything went smoothly. We just parked, walked in, picked it up, and we were out of there faster than you can blink.",

    "text": "Having dined at the Kabuki at the Westgate, and not being overly impressed with our experience there; I didn't want it to detract from my overall impression of this chain's other location.  We met here for lunch with a few friends. It wasn't surprising that with the myriad of dining options at Tempe Marketplace,  this place wasn't that busy at all during the weekday lunch hour. Perhaps, we were just here early, but the absence of any other customer besides us at 11:45 AM didn't bode well.  We all ordered from the lunch menu. I ordered the Samurai, which was a combination of the Teriyaki Chicken & Beef, along with a California Roll, Tempura Vegetables, soup, and a side salad.  In spite of the tremendous value that came with this lunch special, due to the number of included items for the prices, I found it underwhelming in flavor. The chicken and the beef were both cooked, but they didn't seem like the sauces were allowed to permeate beyond the exterior of the meats. The California roll was dry and gritty, which was very surprising, seeing as that the restaurant had only been open for an hour for lunch.  These sushi items shouldn't have been sitting this long to have the lack of consistency and freshness that I would've expected.  The miso soup and the salad were just okay.   As with Miso soup, if they don't stir it prior to pouring onto the service bowl, most of its character will have settled in the bottom of whatever pot these were prepared in. And it definitely tasted as if it were missing key ingredients that would've livened this up.   All in all, it's a decent and hearty meal that is satisfactory. But it certainly doesn't evoke a need to return any time soon.  We did enjoy the atmosphere (since the patronage was sparse), and the server was quite engaging and prompt.   However, as I had mentioned in the introduction; there are many other dining options in this area if this establishment doesn't quite suit your palate.",

The server's are usually pretty attentive and for an asian fusion joint there are some hits here.   Standouts:  Okonomiyaki- Japananese pancake to share that has squid and cabbage and lots of japanese mayo and Okonomiyaki sauce. The pancake came out nice and warm we had to pace ourselves because it's a large appetizer  -Sukiyaki- warming beef noodle broth slightly sweet reminds me of a bulgogi hot pot. It's especially good when it's cold outside   Lunch combos- Ramen and roll combos are such a good deal and you get a lot of food!  Sushi rolls: My favorite roll is the sunkissed roll it has avocado and salmon sashimi and always is pretty.  Sashimi is pretty decent here too.   Stay away from the california rolls and philly rolls for some reason they don't feel that fresh I sampled some during happy hour they were were kind of meh. Maybe the rice needs more sushi vinegar.   Overall a cute date place! We always leave happy and full from here.  One star down because I don't like their new checking system and credit card terminals that servers bring. It puts you on the spot to tip and pay there without printing the receipt for you. There is also no tip line on the printed receipt just the suggested percentages in their terminals. And of course the server is just standing there watching. - This is the kind of sneaky stuff that makes people not want to tip more when you force us just sayin'",

While sometimes the service can be off, the food is 100% of the time fantastic and a reasonable price for great sushi.  I always start with the Garlic Edamame and the Yellowtail Carpaccio.  The Carpaccio is delicious.  All the different spicy rolls are fantastic.  My eyes are always bigger than my tummy and we order too much but we take the extra sushi home for our kids and they love it as well.",

    "text": "I gave Kabuki another chance after corresponding with the management team regarding my previous bad experience. I really respect management for reaching out and trying to make things right, it speaks volumes.   Surprisingly, we actually had a really good recent visit! I can say when things go good at Kabuki, they go really good and when they go bad well.. it's disappointing!   I will also say, consistency in the kitchen would help greatly. Sometimes everything is cooked perfectly like it was for our last visit and sometimes things aren't crisp enough etc. If they could keep service and food consistently great, this would be my first pick for sushi. I'm thinking either there needs to be more oversight, or perhaps there has just been a lot of turn over... I'm not sure but I hope they can keep the good work up.  Anyhow, on to the last visit. We ordered soft shell crabs and the were deliciously crisp! Spot on! We tried the eel and avocado roll with krab which was good, but far from the star of the sushi show. Everyone kept going back for more on the baked lobster roll! I think the lobster roll is probably one of their best, but beware it is decadent!   I was feeling like some calamari, so we ordered that as well.. it was nice, but my heart is with the soft shell crab and lobster roll for sure. Just for good measure we threw in a dish of edamame to look like we were eating healthy (yeah right), but they were good.   Needless to say any future visits will revolve around soft shell crab and baked lobster rolls.",

We arrived to a nice booth and they had cute little chop stick holder helpers for the littles and made eating for them very fun. The lunch specials are where it's at for a good dollar value although I wasn't really impressed at all with the taste of the food not saying it was bad it just wasn't anything to write home about and not sure if I would return but this also comes from someone who doesn't really know Japanese's food. So I Would say give it a try yourself and see what you think. The service was wonderful, again clean and inviting environment and decent food. My picture was the lunch Kabuki and served with soup and salad for $15.95",

I rarely ever go to kabuki and I think the last time was probably 2015. I think there wasn't really anything that kept me wanting to go back. The food was mediocre, and just whatever. I think a good side to this is that it's open fairly late to Arizona standards and the interior is nice. I will say that they have improved on the menu items and selection. The only thing I highly discourage of getting here is the ramen. It's not the best. The way to describe this appropriately is that is more for \"western palettes\" if you understand me youknowwhatimean. The sashimi is good here surprisingly. The salmon is good and also a few rolls like A vegas. They also serve it with freshly made wasabi. I believe I have a better reason now after coming back.",

They have a huge variety of rolls and nigiri as well as plenty of non-fish entrees that can please everyone in a group. You can tell they run a pretty tight ship as far as service too! Even during busy meal rush times the service and quality hold up. They're quick and efficient when accommodating larger groups and they are also my top choice for sushi as takeaway! Ordering to-go is super easy on just about any delivery app or over the phone and the presentation is just as fresh out of a to-go box as it is in person. Located in Tempe Marketplace, so there's plenty to do even if you have to wait for a table, and in my opinion it's worth the wait!",

You cannot go wrong with their apple saketini and the sake sangria is fabulous... Good thing you can't order it by the pitcher!  ;)  We started off with the king crab appetizer and a cold beef tenderloin that had a killer spicy ponzu sauce -- awesome presentation and both very impressive!  I am more of a sushi person but my boyfriend likes meat so we usually end up ordering a couple of rolls and the hibachi beef/chicken plate.  Last time I had the lobster roll and it was clean/decadent.  We also had the lotus on fire roll and it was HOT... they do warn you of this though!   The hibachi is great but the way they bring it out is disappointing... traditionally you have appetizers, soup, salad... thennnnn you have the hibachi... the hibachi made it out before the salad about a minute after the soup.  I could look over this one time but it has happened every time that we have ordered the hibachi along with our sushi.    All in all I would recommend this place if you are going for sushi and having a good time in a cool atmosphere!  May want to give waiter a heads up if you order the hibachi though!!!",

    "text": "I certainly do not consider myself an authority on the topic of sushi, but I've had my fair share of it.  From my experiences, I consider Kabuki to be one of the best for the money.  First of all, if you spend any time at all in Tempe, you know that Kabuki is ideally located within the Tempe Marketplace. Near the 101, near the 202, next to a Harkins theatre, can't beat that.  More importantly, though, once you're inside Kabuki, the service is friendly and helpful, and the food is consistently good.  Both times I've been to Kabuki, I was there with large groups.  So, with that many people at our table, I think it's that much more impressive that they maintained their good service.  I specifically remember having the Lotus Roll on one of my visits and loving it - check it out!",

If you have a big party, or just a starving group, you HAVE to have the Love Boat! A wooden boat with everything great from the menu neatly and gratuitously piled on. (How do you say \"Bon Appetite\" in Japanese? Best I can manage is \"Allez cuisine\" from Iron Chef but ironically that is still French. LOL)  But let's face it, there are two things on the menu that keep my wife and I coming here: The Gold Rush Roll (tempura fried California Roll with Eel Sauce! -- You know, just take possibly the healthiest thing on the menu and DEEP FRY IT!) and the Tempura-fried Green Tea Ice Cream. (See a pattern here?)  It's all good and if you can catch a happy hour you will save even more cash. A word of warning though, this place is ALWAYS busy. Hmmmm... can't imagine why.",

You are definitely paying for the atmosphere here. The food, well, it was good but did not blow me away.   One standout however was a roll they call a \"large Roll\" shrimp, avocado, egg & vegetables. It was not a roll I would have ever ordered but my dinner guest thought it sounded good and to my surprise it was and at $4.95 was reasonable.",

    "text": "My husband and I are currently looking for a favorite sushi joint, so we decided to try this place after looking up reviews here on Yelp!  I was digging the contemporary Japanese look! The lighting was very nice and ambient. We were seated very quickly, even during Happy Hour. Could be because there were only two of us and it was a Monday.  I ordered a peach kiwi-flavored Calpico soda ($2.50), which our waitress thought they were sold out of, but they actually weren't. It came with little bits of kiwi, which I thought was neat!  I ordered the Alaskan Roll ($6.95 during Happy Hour), since the Rainbow Roll wasn't a part of the Happy Hour menu. That's okay because it was AMAZING! I don't know what sauce the roll was topped with, but it was very good.  The salmon was cooked to perfection and the eel sauce complimented the roll perfectly. Looks like I've found another favorite roll!  My husband ordered the Gold Rush Roll ($5.95 during Happy Hour) and he said that he loved it.   We decided to order a third roll that we could both share, so we chose the Las Vegas Roll ($6.95 during Happy Hour). I've never had a roll with cream cheese in it, but it was very good. It left a sort of cheesy aftertaste, but that's probably not the chef's fault at all.  Only bad thing of the whole experience was the service. Our waitress took a very long time to get us our food, longer than a couple folks who came in after us. She also only checked on us a single time (when we were already 99% done with our food), and took a while to get us our bill when we were completely done.   Excellent stuff, despite the sub par service. Maybe the waitress was just having a bad day, who knows. We will definitely be coming back, but really only for Happy Hour since we can hardly afford the normal prices.",

    "text": "And now, the long awaited Kabuki update... to be fair, this update is a combination of several mishaps and events... they all are related to each other, and therefore I felt they needed to be reviewed together.   As I've previously stated, I was never going to rush back to kabuki. The first and only trip was enough for me. However, about two months or so ago, I was invited to a lunch for a project I was on, and I hesitantly went. The lunch was back to back with a meeting I had... knowing this, and my issues last time, I arrived a half hour early with another coworker to make sure my order was in. We each ordered three rolls if I remember correctly. After we ordered, the others arrived (please note, it took a half hour to be able to put our order in... even though no one was in the restaurant).  Everyone else began to put theirs in as well and sushi and other ordered items began to arrive. 20 more minutes passed and I soon realized everyone had their food but me. Even those that ordered after. It was now close to my time to leave so I flagged down our server and asked him if I could have my sushi to go. I wasn't extremely hungry, but knew I would be craving something by mid afternoon.  It all went downhill from here. Rather than checking on my order or anything else for that matter, I was attacked and accused of not putting an order down. After all, had it been, it obviously would've been at the table. After 5 minutes of several people ensuring him my order was on a list, I gave up and said to just bring me a philly roll quick so I can not starve myself. One of my coworkers graciously gave up his take home items so I could eat. I was ever thankful.  I left angry and upset...but thanks to friends not completely starving. The food was good, but quickly overlooked by the terrible service I've received both times I've been here. Honestly the food is the only thing that gives them the 2nd star. I bitched on twitter about my disdain and soon had a message from their corporate office. They wanted to call me to discuss the matter with that locale. I told them I didn't really wish to speak with the locale. What's done is done. I wasn't sure what they could honestly say to make me feel better about how I was treated.  Kabuki responded with a rather generous gift card. I decided I would give them one more shot (after all, it was on the house). Honestly I was scared to use it... even with the meal being free, I wasn't sure I could handle the stress of another bad experience. It took me nearly a month to use it.  This past week, I returned and took with me the kind coworker who offered me their take home sushi. We made sure to go on a day where we didn't have any appointments immediately after lunch. We also arrived early. Once again, the place was practically empty. There were only 4 other people there.   We started off with drinks as we pondered the menu. The drinks my friends, are heavenly. I had a lychee mojito and an apple saketini and practically downed them in one gulp. Filled to the brim, tasteful and beautiful works of art they were.   We both ordered a few different items. I got two rolls and some nigiri. I was honestly shocked at the relatively ok speed at which they came out. We received our sushi about a half hour after ordering it. Still not super fast, but well, it's better than not getting it at all. The presentation was decent and the sushi was delicious. My ebi nigiri came with a tempura shrimp in the shape of a bunny. That creeped me out a lot. Please don't do that.  In the end, the service is still slow enough and I've had so many bad experiences there, that I would not trust it for lunch. It will never be in my top 5 places to go at any point in time. However, if I end up arriving at Tempe Marketplace 3 hours early for an event, or if someone wants to go to grab a saketini, I will consider it. The only saving grace this establishment has is it's corporate office, a saketini, and decent sushi (once you get it).  There are rumors that my picture may be in the back of the restaurant as a warning for when I come in.... hopefully this is not the reason I had a slight improvement in service.",

There is also a plethora of options/specialty rolls (my absolute favorite being the Sunkissed roll) that don't all contain cream cheese and tempura like most other sushi places. You also have the option to sub in brown rice, which is nice when I'm in the mood for that. Edamame also always comes free with sushi, yum!  I signed up for their loyalty card so basically every $500 you spend, you get a $25 gift certificate (can't use it during happy hour).  This is one of my favorite places for sushi. I can't say much for the regular menu having only eating an actual dinner entree once (which was still delicious).  Only problems I have with this place is that it's always FREEZING inside and, while they have HH and reverse HH, almost non of the rolls I want to eat are listed.",

I ended up getting the Unagi Bowl and asked that they hold the avocado. My mother ordered the Teriyaki Chicken and my fiancee got a Spicy Ramen bowl. When the food arrived we were less than impressed.   My bowl had the avocados in it that I had asked them to hold. It also took some spices to really make the dish taste better. My fiancee needed a combination of spices and hot sauce to make her ramen close to palatable. Her broth also looked watery and akin to chicken noodle soup. My mom enjoyed her dish, but it's disappointing that the most basic dish was the one they nailed. It's not a terribly expensive place, but for the price, I would have expected more.  There are tons of other places to go for good Japanese cuisine. I can't really recommend this place for anything out of the ordinary. For basic dishes, they are fine. But I probably won't return any time soon.  UPDATE 4/15: Zhen, the floor manager, reached out to me shortly after the review to invite us back to try Kabuki again. We went back today for lunch and the food was much better! I had the salmon teriyaki bowl lunch special and my fiancee got the Kabuki Deluxe lunch special. The presentation of the food was great and Zhen personally came by to ensure our orders were made to our liking.   This experience was far better than our original one and I would be happy to return at any time. Thank you Zhen for helping us out!",

They have great drink selections with the flavored margaritas being particularly delicious.  As a non-seafood fan, there is plenty on the menu that I can eat. I love the sesame chicken (it's got a great kick to it) and I love the california tempura roll. They give you a side of edamame free when you order sushi.  My husband is slightly more adventurous and likes the Dynamite roll.  We've also had the seaweed salad and enjoyed that. Definitely will continue to go back!",

My birthday party had to make a restaurant switch after waiting 2 hours at Gen Korean next door (don't go there they are rude/ and have bad business practices).   After being moved to the back of the wait list for 2 hours I had enough.  My party of 23 people went to Kabuki with (20 minutes left to close).  The manager and her staff did not turn us away.  She kindly made an area for us, and sat us pretty promptly. While we waited the manager comped appetizers for us of edamame and dumplings to make up to us for having such a bad situation happen to me on my birthday. SO KIND AND CONSIDERATE.  The wait staff got our drink orders and our food out to us really fast. My husband and i and two others  got the dream platter to share. it was SOOOOOOOOOOO Good.  My other friends also enjoyed their meals.    We did not feel rushed out of the restaurant but did respect that the waiters/ kitchen staff, and manager stayed later to help us.   I HIGHLY recommend and would definitely go back.  A+++ for Kabuki on my birthday celebration.",

I personally love their cilantro albacore roll and lava roll but whenever I'm craving some deliciously warm food I go for their spicy seafood pasta- absolutely to die for!!! Of course though, great food is best accompanied by amazing service and our waiter Matthew was more than accommodating and went above and beyond with his amiable personality and wonderful suggestions. Last but not least the local menu specials are phenomenal- Sakura saketini... 10/10!",

I called and asked if it was cooked or brought out in the traditional hotpot so I can cook it it tableside.  The person that answered said.. Yes. It's cooked tableside.  When I arrived. .I was told it only comes pre cooked, not at tableside.  The dish I ate was yummy  But it Definitely wasn't Sukiyaki.  It was a good beef soup.  90% beef 10% onions and table mushrooms.    Regular Sukiyaki comes 50/50 with Japanese veggies and beef.    Very disappointed   So I Tried The cucumber wrapped king crab.  The slices of cucumber were so thick.....Instead of thin..that I almost choked on it.  What a let down  But the only thing that was exceptional. Was the coconut infused sake at 21 a bottle.  Very expensive but very tasty!  I also loved the  Shishito pepper appetizer.  Very yummy with Bonito fish flakes, garlic and teriyaki style sauce  American Japanese with a corporate taste and no passion for their food.  But I'm sure the wide variety of  sushi is probably the only thing I would ever order if I come back for.",

Ordering sushi is a process. He just just happily answered every question and help some people order sushi who've never had it. I'll def be back for the food. But I'll always ask for Jaime.",

The location is great with tons of parking in Tempe Marketplace. Upon walking in, it has a very modern feel and a very open floor plan. The staff was nice enough upon my entrance and I was walked to my friends table.  It took a minutes for the waitress to come by and take our drink order but she was very pleasant and provided us with a few recommendations as we didn't realize we were there during happy hour. The happy hour menu was definitely big enough and provided an amazing selection. Not to mention the prices were ridiculously inexpensive. We ordered a couple of rolls to get us started (the Philly roll and spicy tuna roll I believe). We split them and we're both impressed with the quality - especially for the price! We then ordered the Baja roll which was AMAZING!!   The only reason for four stars instead of five was due to the fact that once we're done with our food instead of offering to refill our drinks the waitress simply dropped off the check and never came back again. Other than that it was a great experience and I will definitely be coming back!",

Waiter changed my rice into white rice at the end but the sukiyaki taste actually.... (can't describe my feelings)  The spicy tuna crunch roll taste not bad but too big for a mouth to occupied.

Whenever I've come in, they haven't been that crowded (but I usually come around 3). Our waitress was so sweet but hard to catch. It took a while to order and even longer to get our bill. We got a California roll and a Dynamite roll, they tasted very FRESH and LIGHT!   My friend ordered the teriyaki chicken as an entree. It came with a choice of WHITE or BROWN rice and a couple vegetables on the side. The chicken was cooked well and the sauce was a little on the sweet side.

The first thing I noticed when walking into the restaurant was how much dust was on the display shelves and bottles. Not ideal but not a big deal either. We asked to sit at the sushi bar. Our server was great and immediately took our drink and appetizer order. While waiting for apps we realized how dirty the sushi bar was. The countertop still had food remnants on it and the sushi case had a think layer of grime and dust on the outside. It definitely hadn't been cleaned in awhile. Unfortunately this made me lose my appetite and we canceled our order. We spoke with the manager who was sincere and listened to our concerns. If it weren't for the quality service I would rate one star due to the lack of attention to cleanliness.",

    "text": "Kabuki is always a great culinary experience. If I go directly to the restaurant, I sit at bar and the service of the bartenders can't be beat. I highly recommend the mango jalapeno margarita as it's tasty and with a kick. The best appetizer by far is the tasty flavor of the broiled mussels topped with a baked cheese sauce and nuts. If you are feeling like a soup, you can not got wrong with the pumpkin squash soup. Some of the ultimate delicacy's include the uni (sea urchin) with a quail egg and the toro hamachi sashimi (fatty yellowtail). If you are feeling like not going to risky, easy, enjoy the Sunkist roll as it's an all time fav of many customers.   If you can't get out of the house, not worried as Door Dash offers delivery for free for Kabuki. If there is something the restaurant doesn't not have or needs to alter, they will call you within minutes of submitting your order and refund you any difference right then and there.   I hope you enjoy the information, my recommendations and this great experience.",

There is one menu item that keeps me coming back but that is it. I love the Firecracker appetizer! Spicy tuna with wonton chips that you make your own little nachos with and it's soo yummy! I get mine with no onion, extra cilantro.   The service has never been great, it seems like they have a big staff, a high turn over rate and there is always a new server that seems clueless.   I used to get the miso soup with crab (it was a bigger portion of miso with big chunks of crab meat) and the last time I was there the server seemed to have no idea what it was. So, I guess that is off the menu :(   I will keep coming back for that Firecracker but their sushi is pretty terrible and their ramen/noodle dishes are not authentic at all so I don't eat a full dinner here.",

I'm really not a fan of Kabuki at Westgate but this Tempe Marketplace location is great. Recently, my favorite udon place closed down and I found myself craving uni udon. A friend of mine had recommended that I try the Uni Crab Udon Pasta at Kabuki and I gotta admit that it's not bad.  The udon at Westgate Kabuki was overcooked but TM Kabuki was cooked properly. Both places made their dishes with a lack of uni flavor (since the uni is cooked) but it's not to say the dishes were a fail. What they lack in uni, they make up for in crab flavor. Fresh crab is used and it's delicious! They top the dish with fried garlic chips and it's tasty. The TM Kabuki included daikon sprouts with their Uni Crab Udon Pasta which gave it a different flavor. I also like their seasonal Kabocha (pumpkin) soup which is cream and butter Heaven. Their rolls are still awful though and no one can change my mind.  Chain sushi joints are meh but I'll come here and get udon when I want to burn $20 on a modest serving of noodz. 3-stars!",

It was nice out, so we sat outside.  That was part of the problem.  The service outside was not so good.  My friend had to ask for a water refill 4 times from 3 different people (including a manager) and didn't get it until we were leaving.  It took a long time to get through the lunch (over an hour).  Hopefully they'll work that kink out as they are open longer.  I only ordered sushi rolls and edamame, so I can't speak to the rest of the menu.  We tried about 5 different rolls and they were all pretty good.  Some weren't my flavor, but that comes with the trying new things territory.  I've had better sushi, but it wasn't bad.  My biggest gripe is that they cut the rolls into 6 pieces which makes them hard to eat because the pieces are WAY too big for me and I felt like I was chewing forever.  Next time I am there I will ask them to cut it into 8 pieces.  If they'll do that, they have a returning customer here.  I'll bump 'em up to 3.5 stars for the great happy hour prices.  The sushi craving wasn't completely cured, but subdued for now.",

The sushi didn't seem to be as fresh or the fish as high of quality as other places.  This group eats sushi all the time. Among the lowlights was one person put a roll in her mouth only to come across a tooth pick that was meant to hold the roll in place (i'm assuming), but was broken somewhere along the way.  I wasn't impressed with what I had-some beef item and some sesame chicken. I should have just drank my beers and had the enaname and nothing else.  The one bright spot was the happy hour beer, drinks and the lower cost of the food items during happy hour. Everyone would have been really irked if we had to pay full price for the food since there was little to no enjoyment there.  Service was pretty slow and took awhile to get the check..   This place would be at the bottom if not the bottom of Japanese/sushi places in/around Tempe.",

We ordered a bottle of the plum wine for $20 and it was delicious. we also ordered the seafood salad, which was a generous heaping of crab, tons of baby scallops and shrimp over a bed of mixed greens with a ginger dressing, cucumber and carrots. we also ordered yellow tail & maguro sushi, plus the eel, crab and avacodo roll & the fried california roll served on eel sauce. it was all very fresh and tasty. the last roll melted in my mouth, their california rolls have a crab mix inside, my only complaint, except when its deep fried.  the free serving of edamame was a nice start too!   the first time we tried kabuki was on my sisters birthday last July. she had a group of 15 and they were very accomodating, even dressed and presented our own cake brought in for her. for a big group, they did a phenominal job, even with all the split checks \"Oye vei\" just the thought. oh yeah speaking of head effecting, we all had a popper that makes a bang when you pull the string and at the blow of the candles we pulled the strings. even with all the loud pops and the stares, the servers, managers and bussers were so nice, not saying a word or frowning on it.  (but don't try this unless your ready for the repercussions) ENJOY yelpers and make sure if you don't want a big 'o roll to eat, order the cut rolls, hand rolls are always big (someone should teach a sushi 101 class to teach these things, it might curtail all the bad reviews)  the best part about eating there is the nice walk around the tempe market place. its a strip mall-turned outdoor entertainment haven for tourist, but its people watching at its best. only problem is its in an akward area, with one way in and one way out. the traffic in & out sucks and sometimes the parking is worse, but get over it , enjoy the company your with and get your Kabuki on!",

He replied with very rude attitude, \"yeah I can do that. I'm just gonna throw them away. But u can only use one coupon per table!\" So he took the order back along with my two extra piece (my leftover I didn't want) he rather end biz n pissed off their customer over $4 Cali roll...really?! All he did was prove his point-that he is right n customers r wrong.  I had never seen any service like that ever! Corp office will hear from me as soon as they open on Monday",

I am now addicted to the lychee martini too. I shared the vegi tempura and it was the best I ever had.  This place is a perfect spot for a girls gathering or first date. The patio is small but great for people watching in Tempe Marketplace.  And of course there is something for the non sushi eater too!",

    "text": "I am surprised to see the average for this place is only 3 stars. As a frequenter of many tempe sushi establishments, I think kabuki is a great spot for Japanese food. We went during happy hour with a group of 7, and even though nobody was drinking alcohol, we recieved excellent and fast service. Their happy hour is fantastic; they have really affordable appetizer and sushi rolls from 3-6, as well as drink specials (obviously). I also like that they have a vast menu, so even people who are not comfortable with sushi can still find something they will enjoy. For those who ARE comfortable with the raw, I like trying something new each time I go, and I haven't been disappointed yet. I also really like that they give you free edamame to start with - many places charge for it, although only a few dollars.   ***If you save room for dessert, be sure to try the Tempura Banana....omg. It's like heaven in your mouth! I would return for that alone. If Tempura Banana is available as a dessert option I almost always go for it, but this one is the best I've had anywhere.   Overall, I think Kabuki has a wonderful menu and great service. If you're in the tempe area, it's worth trying out!  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it's pretty corporate/chain-y, and not as \"unique\" as some other places. But if you're new to the Japanese food scene, it's a safe (and delicious) bet!",

I probably come here more often than the food is worth but it is right down the street and quite frankly I am lazy. I would give them an extra star BUT literally every single time I have been here (I have been here more times than I could count) the service is absolutely HORRIBLE. It takes several minutes to be greeted once you walk in the door and even longer to be greeted and have your drink order taken. Every single time your food will come after you have asked yourself several times \"Shouldn't I be eating by now?\". I finally lost it last night after countless bad experiences with the service here and will probably not be returning. Guess I will have to drive a little further now for my sushi. However, if you are feeling patient and do decide to try Kabuki their Alaska Roll is super.",

Compared to some other choices (Sushi101=small, cramped, poor quality; RA=dirty, smelly, loud), it seems to be the best in our book.  The service is okay. No one smiling or seemingly excited about their lives, but they keep the beverages coming.  The sushi is good. I admit I'm a roll fan, so take what I say with a grain of salt. The rolls bigger than most and I personally like the rose, the philly, the lotus, the lotus on fire, the dragon, and variations of the california roll (topped with scallops, lobster, deep fried, etc.).   I give them four stars because I frequent here with the work crowd and we like it enough to come back.",

We had usual selections of sushi which turned out to be ok, spicy tuna roll, and kabuki roll which was very interesting...better than we expected.  The ama-ebi was bigger and sweeter than the one served at Shimogamo.  Oh and Ikura (salmon roe) was fresh.  Price wise, it was more than what we are used to b/c the prices at Kabuki in Old Town Pasadena, CA are usually cut in half all night long.  Overall, it was good enough to add to the list of fav/convenient restaurants.  So Shimogamo? or Kabuki?......I say Kabuki b/c of it's fun location.  You get to shop, have desserts, and the area is very lively.   *Location = good *Price = expected...around $90/couple without alcohol *Food = pretty good",

I got a couple creamy peach saketini that were on 'special' for 6.25. Still pretty steep for the drink. It was tasty, I just thought it was overpriced. I also got the gyoza (on special for 5$) and a house salad. The gyoza were pretty good, I liked the sauce that was on them. The salad was fine... It was just a romaine mix, probably from a bag, with a ginger dressing. I liked the ginger dressing, but it was kind of only on the top of the salad. Overall, it was just ok. The service was also alright, some people didn't get their food when they should have (they forgot someone's dish AND brought out the wrong rice, she ordered chicken teriyaki and said it tasted like the sauce was out of a bottle AND I thought it was ridiculous that they charged like 12$ and gave you dark meat... really? That is insanity. +2$ for white meat.) The prices here were just laughable, if I had gotten a real meal it would have cost at least 10$ but i'd say the average for non sushi was 15$....not worth it.  I would definitely not come back here if it weren't happy hour.",

Falling apart at the touch, it left us with sloppy soy solution invaded by floating what-nots that spilled off the tops and insides of our rolls. Not to toot my horn, but I'm no chop-stick novice, this wasn't a lack of form on my part. Overkill on the mayo and underkill on the take-away impression.  Would I ever go back? Sure.

    "text": "A friend took me here because she loves this place. I mean it's a big packed restaurant in a big packed shopping mall - what's not to like? So of course there was a waiting time of 20 minutes even though there were only 3 of us. They text you twice - first time for confirmation and second when a table becomes available - you get 5/10 minutes to show up. So we hung out in the mall for a bit listening to some band playing in the courtyard. When we finally got our table our host walked us all the way to the back near the restrooms. I had some Sapporo beer straight away and ordered the Sea Bass sushi and Sea Snail sushi. Both were good except the rice portion crumbled the moment I picked it up. I also ordered the Char Siu Ramen. Yes I did. Don't know why but I had high hopes and it sounded really good on the menu. Maybe I didn't see the fine print that said \"don't get this - it actually sucks and didn't you come here for the sushi anyway?\" When they brought it I started sipping the broth and WTF - I was contemplating throwing it across the room in a fit of rage and then dancing on the table. But no - didn't have THAT many Sapporos yet. The broth tasted really bland like Campbell's Low Sodium Chicken Broth. Were they really using that crap as broth for ramen? Not to mention it's way overpriced to begin with - nevermind what they actually did to it. At least the char siu was pretty good and the noodles were alright. The broth is a big part of it though and even though they usually get it wrong in these parts it's usually still passable. If there is a next time I'll just stick to the sushi. Plenty of parking. Your mileage may vary.",

    "text": "The fish is always very fresh and delicious. We usually get good service. Unfortunately, this place is listed as \"gluten free friendly\" when it is not. Yes, they have gluten-free soy sauce, but on all but one occasion I have had to ask for it multiple times and then go get it myself.   The manager told me that ALL of their sauces, including the mayo, have wheat in them. The only way to get gluten-free sushi here is to get everything with NO sauce. They add wheat-based soy sauce and wheat seasoning to all the sauces, which is totally unnecessary. I mean, mayo does not need wheat or soy sauce added.  Unfortunately, none of the wait staff alerted me to this until I had visited several times! I had ordered various things and asked questions about wheat content, and no one ever told me that the sauces all have wheat in them.   The wait staff and the manager were very reluctant and resistant to the idea of just plopping a little plain mayo or ponzu or other sauce on a plate for me. After I asked over and over, the manager did bring me a little bit of mayo, but I should not have had to ask over and over. It's just mayo, they do not make mayo in-house, and it is a matter of service.   Also, when I asked questions about wheat-free items, our waiter directed me to the vegan menu. He did not understand the difference between vegan and gluten-free: he thought it was the same thing.   I really loved Kabuki and went there about 2-3 times a month before I found out that there was hidden wheat in all the sauces. So, I'm very disappointed.",

    "text": "I'd probably give a place like this more points if they weren't so damn over priced and had a bit better execution. A fairly small tuna poke appetizer and 2 not that special rolls for over $30 without drinks really?  The poke was ok but not anything like a traditional poke and for some reason they add what seems to be spicy tuna sauce to the tuna first which i don't get and made it a bit too spicy for Sharon H. without mixing it with the rest of the dish. I liked it overall but not as poke which is a very specific taste to me this seemed to lack.   The Sunkissed roll was a good idea but needs better execution. I want avocado and salmon with each bite not on alternating pieces. Oh and premium avocado has good flavor and isn't bland. I did like the special sauce. A little less onion or maybe not raw onion might help too.  The anago tempura roll just misses the mark for me and was over priced for what it was as it was tempura eel with cucumber, mint and fried garlic. at $11 most places have an eel and cucmber roll for $5 and the little slivers of garlic and sprig of mint aren't worth an extra $6. Plus the thing was just too many conflicting flavors and the garlic was over cooked to being so hard it was like biting a piece of rock it actually hurt a bit and didn't feel natural.  To top this all off i just didn't feel the fish quality was up to par. The salmon especially didn't have the normal taste. I will give sushi places a pass when its cheap and not that high quality but when it's expensive and lacking its a problem. The salmon had a fishy taste and didn't have that normal salmon flavor which stood out the most.",

    "text": "Yesterday my family and I went to Kabuki even after the experience with the service there is been horrible because we like the food but this las time is the last time we are going to eat there. I order tuna salad with fried calamari and 2 rolls keep in mind that this place is very expensive, my father in law order a roll and my wife order some rolls with appetizers. The food came all at one like a hurricane and very poorly executed. The rice on the rolls was horrible the rolls where to large and thin hard to grab with the shop stick, I been eating Japanese food for year and I am an expert with the stick and I can tell if the rice is been cooked properly. All the rolls where very small for the price and with out presentation, they fall a part and when I told the waiter to please take this back he said that the manager can only take half because I eat half of the roll. I personally think that the manager can even count because it came with 5 pieces and I returned 4 they fall a parts on my cloth ruining my shirt and causing a bad experience. This is the last time that we are going to eat here and if you think that this is not bad please walk in to the restroom first it is horrible I can only imagine how clean is the kitchen. We spent 150 dollars in a table of 3.! Bad place do not eat there.",

We sat outside and because the weather was really nice it occured to me that if people watching is your thing this is the place for you.  Just make sure you sit outside.  I ordered the chicken samboro which was excellent.  I started it off with a kale salad that was perfect.  The atmosphere was pleasent.  We got there at 6pm on a friday and it seemed like the crowd was a mix of business people wrapping up meetings, people getting before dinner drinks and families trying to have dinner before the kids go nuts.  I don't think many people would come here for the cool vibe as much as the food so I didn't have a high expectation.  I have to give three stars because it's always awkward to me that when we arrive there are a lot of available tables and they make you wait as if you were trying to get in to Studio 54.  Not sure what that is about.  Who are they checking with?  Nothing seems to really change excpet the time that has passed between when we arrive and when we get seated.  At any rate, the food is good and I will be back.",

    "text": "This is definitely my go-to Sushi place! Great for dates, celebrations and taking out-of-towners. Walking in, the decor and ambiance is trendy, clean and impressive, yet casual enough where you don't' feel out of place if you're not dressed up. The pretty hostesses are friendly and accommodating- I've yet to experience bad service in all the times I've been there. Depending on the time of day, there could be a long wait, but hey! you're in Tempe Marketplace! If you have to wait, take the vibrating coaster and head outside! Enjoy the fireplace right in front or go shopping right next door! The area is gorgeous !  I suggest snatching the patio tables if it becomes available or squeeze in at the bar if you don't have the patience to wait. The patio seating by the bar is definitely my favorite spot. It's great for people watching and enjoying the Arizona air. For a bonus! if you go on weekends, there's usually a live performer right outside Barns & Noble so you get a show with your meal!   So let's talk FOOD!! Yaaay! They change up their menu now and then to keep things interesting. If you haven't tried the Garlic Edamame, it's a tasty twist to the regular Edamame. My favorite appetizer is the BBQ Beef Ribs. Order a side of rice and you're set! Careful unless you want to fill up. I recommend going there for Happy Hour and/or Reverse Happy Hour (awesome prices!) where my usual Broiled Mussel on a Half Shell is only $5.95! Yumm! The poke tuna is great but I don't remember if we were too impressed by the steamed clams. They have a HUGE selection of Sushi rolls. These are my favs: Paradise, Eel & Avocado, Rainbow, & Sunkissed roll. If you're there with a huge party and super hungry, I suggest ordering their Boat option. Very fun. The only time I remember being disappointed was when I ordered their ramen dish and some of the food we tried came out a bit more salty than we like, but overall, this is really a great place to dine. To end this review- you have to check out their Drink selections!! Cocktails, Spirits, Sake, Wine, Beer.. anything you like! Enjoy!",

The happy hour, however, is relatively non-existent. I strive for happy hours with sushi discounts, and sadly this is not one of those places. The drink specials on happy hour are pretty non-existent as well, so for me, the food better be damn good if I'm going to go there.   I'm OBSESSED with the Lotus Roll. It's 6 California Rolls arranged in a star pattern topped with baked lobster and smelt roe. Seriously incredible. I would recommend it to anyone who likes lobster. This is also the roll that introduced me to roe and I haven't been able to get enough of it since. This roll is particularly good with roe because the baked lobster is hot and warms up the roe so it's not so cold which can make it taste fishy. If you don't know what roe is, it's fish eggs. It sounds weird, I know. But please do not not get a roll because of it! The sushi chefs at Kabuki really know how to use it artfully.",

I have only sat at a table once.  The main dining room, has a Japanese Modern feel, but slightly lacking.  However, being in a mainly target demo of College students, I wouldn't spend too much money here as well.  Sushi bar - Excellent, this is were Matthew and I generally sit.  I have still been finishing a really boring no carb thing.  Great selections here and oddly good salmon and yellow tail.  I did try a new item on the app menu today.  Grilled calamari - eh :(  I don't recommend.    Rewards - They have a sign up membership.  I actually is worth it, If you happen to like sushi and like Kabuki.  We signed up and got our money's worth.  Seems like your eyes are always bigger than your stomach with sushi, so any money saved is a plus!  Also Sports fans,  there is a TV at the end of the sushi bar in addition to the bar.",

    "text": "So True story: I am meeting four friends for happy hour at Kabuki before we head to the screening of Paper Heart with the free passes we won from Yelp.  I had never been there & the average on Yelp was 3 stars, but we needed to head to a place at Tempe Marketplace so I gave it a shot.  I arrived 1st and was waiting for friends to show up. I asked if they had any vodka drinks on hh special or well drink specials. The guy said they only had beer & Saki on special for hh. Being the twitter addict that I am, I tweeted that there was no vodka on their hh specials which was lame, especially since I am allergic to yeast & don't care for saki.  A manager came up to me a little while later & asked if I was Julia. I said I was & he apologized that there was no vodka on the hh menu, but that he'd like to make up for it by giving me a free appetizer. Then he was like, \"You are Julia right? Cause I couldn't see your eyes.\" I wasn't sure what he meant at the time, but then I realized he read my tweet & found me from my picture on twitter where my eyes aren't showing. Crazy.  I tried to get a veggie appetizer, but he suggested I get the lobster one, so I went with it.  The whole thing was crazy, but really awesome. This restaurant actually saw a customer tweet a complaint, found that customer, and offered something to make the experience better.  So awesome job Kabuki, and oh yeah pretty decent sushi & service as well.  Give them a try and follow them on twitter @KabukiCorporate",

Just had a few rolls all of which were fine.  3 of the 4 rolls were about the size as a coffee cup, way too big for a humans mouth.  So what's a person do with rolls that are too big?  Do you:   A) Push the entire roll in you pie-hole and hope no food falls out when you start chewing. B) Cut up the roll with a knife and fork. C) Use your chopsticks to pick apart the roll into small bite size portions.  Have your answer ready before you visit this place.",

    "text": "A small group of us went here to eat several weeks ago... they weren't so busy that there was a wait, but the table we wanted outside was still dirty. We were tired and starving so we sat down anyway after they promised to have it cleaned straight away.  20 minutes later, nobody had offered to take our drink order, but we managed to get someone to take most of the disgusting plates off of our table. We had asked a few people to send someone out to take our order and the table next to us that had been seated after us had gotten menus and drinks.   They must've not understood that we were new customers even though the hostess knew, the waiter whos section it was new, and the bus boy and bartender both knew as well because we told them. I guess the filthy plates of half-eaten food and slime were tricking them.   The five of us sat there trying to talk over the sounds of our gurgling stomachs as we waited for about a half hour without menus, drinks or any indication we were going to get served... finally, an off-duty employee came out and asked us if we had been served. We said no and that we were leaving and he flipped out. He said he wasn't on the clock so he couldn't help us, but he would try to flag someone down immediately.  In the end, the place smelled very fishy (which you should know is a bad sign when eating at a fish restaurant - especially sushi) and we decided to just split and get food elsewhere. Between the fishy smell and the non service, there wasn't much keeping us there.  The place looked kinda nice and I'm sure we just had an isolated experience - but until I actually try again and get some food and service, this will have to be my review - one star. If the place had been ultra packed, I might have forgiven this a little more.",

If, however, you are looking for a happy hour spot with cheap, good drinks in a chic environment where you can also get some discounted sushi, Kabuki is the spot for you.   My husband and I were going to see the premiere of the Mamma Mia sing-along version at Harkins Tempe Marketplace and wanted to stop at a happy hour or two first. Thanks to previous Yelp reviews, we found out that Kabuki has happy hour featuring drink and food specials, so we decided to check it out. I loved the decor in the bar area - very sleek and modern with lots of cool, vertical Sake bottle displays. Our drinks (on special for $4.95) were quite good - I had the Mint Drop, which was refreshing but not too sweet and he had the Long Island, which was nice and strong without being disgusting. For snacks, we had the Spicy Tuna and Salmon Skin rolls (each $2.95) - both were fine but not much better than the stuff you can buy at grocery stores. Our server was friendly and efficient.   All in all, we got two good drinks and some standard sushi for under $20, including tip. Not bad. Kabuki is definitely a cool spot for meeting some friends for happy hour, but don't count on the sushi being anything to write home about.",

We knew we wanted to try a new place for Sushi and instead of using Yelp reviews we used the convenience of Tempe Marketplace, big mistake. With all of the new Sushi places and good reviews on here I wish we wouldn't have wasted the time or money at Kabuki.   We sat at the bar and I wouldn't blame all of the bad experience on the bartender. There was one for the entire bar and for the entire restaurant (making all of the drinks for the servers as well). Therefore, it took a good 10 minutes of us sitting in front of him for him to ask us what we wanted to drink. We ordered 3 items about 30 minutes into being there. After being there for about an hour we received one item that we ordered then 10 minutes later received one more and one that we didn't order. We said we would just eat it but instead they put in for our original order and stored the Sushi in a fridge under the bar (whomever orders that roll next is not going to get it rolled fresh).   The good thing was that it wasn't terribly expensive. $6-$10 for a roll and I think around $8 or $9 for a Sake Bomb. It just took us close to two hours to eat at the bar and the food wasn't really that amazing. I hate giving bad reviews, maybe I will change it to 3....no I will leave it at 2. If we ever stop in again and it is better I will definitely raise my star rating.",

I started off with a Kirin, which is a good way to kick off any Japanese-ish meal, in my opinion.  I ordered the Beef Teriyaki, which comes with a very tasty miso, a bowl of rice and a rather mediocre salad.  The teriyaki was very well prepared, the meat cooked just right and the sauce tasty without being overpowering.     Also, the prices here are pretty reasonable.  I think the meal was in the $13 neighborhood and the 22oz. beer was $7.  Along with the huge list of sushi choices, they also had a nice selection of cooked seafood, as well. So, there's a little something for everyone.  I'm proof of that.",

    "text": "After we watched Deadpool, I convinced some of my crew to go to this sushi restaurant. The cool part about Tempe Marketplace is that it conveniently has everything you ever need in a hipster outdoor mall. Even when it's 120 degrees in the summer, Tempe Marketplace mists so much water it feels like it's 80.  Whether you need to go to the movies, enjoy some music, dance some salsa or eat at the handful of chain and authentic restaurants, Tempe Marketplace is a nice little hub for all of that. Of course, from what I gathered, there is only one Asian place that stands out and that is a sushi restaurant.  My friends have told me about Kabuki. I might have even met someone who actually worked there. It's a nice, upscale-feel restaurant without it being too upscale.   Taste My friends decided to just order a bunch of rolls for us to eat. We got the following rolls Firecracker roll (waiter recommended): This beautiful yet simple roll has a california roll stacked with a pink piece of salmon and the most unique part is that it not only has a crisp lotus root piece and japaleno, but on the sides is lined with this crunchy panko crumbs and mayonnaise based hot sauce. To eat this roll, I find it effective to dip the piece in the mayo and then use the mayo as a sticky agent to the crunchy bits. This essentially coats the piece in the crunchy bits. Pop it in your mouth and hopefully you aren't super clumsy and drop the jalapeno or lotus root on your plate.   Overall, a good roll with a refreshing heat thanks to the fresh jalapeno. The crunch provided from the panko crumbs and lotus root makes this piece enjoyable. We even ordered another rone because we liked it so much.  Rainbow Roll: This was a standard roll and I wasn't very impressed with it. The ingredients didn't look very fresh and so I didn't eat much of it. I had one piece and to be honest, I was not impressed at all. It's a standard sushi roll. Nothing special really.   Dragon Roll: Layered with unagi, this roll is supposed to look like a dragon. They kind of nailed it...  The unagi was delicious but I feel like the prize of the dish was the giant piece on the \"face\" of the dragon. The big piece of Unagi was extremely satisfying. The res tof the roll was ok. Kabuki Roll: If I ever had a roll to myself, I would get this one. Each of the 8 rolls has a special design on it that made it seem like an auspicious journey just to eat it. I would say this was my favorite roll because of the simplicity yet creativity of each piece of sushi. I only had the salmon flower and the salmon roe pieces. The salmon flower was alright but that salmon roe was deliciously salty and it reminded me that I should eat salmon roe more often. As you can see from the picture, the plate leads you to all different types of textures and flavors that are ripe for eating.  Ambiance Kabuki has nice architecture and it reminds me of a sushi restaurant and a really tame nightclub. It has a dark, mysterious vibe and the waiters and waitress's all black uniforms give it a sense of professionalis. Overall, this restaurant has perfect ambiance and I loved the shapely decorations of the whole place.   This place is also huge for a sushi restaurant which shows that they have done well for themselves. It has a Japanese theme, but the style is very new-age American.   Service I think our waiter was new but he was alright. I always do a stress test and ask the waiters what their favorite dish is. He said the firecracker roll and I say he has good taste. Nothing much to write home about here. Being in a hot spot for entertainment in Tempe, these guys have to be quick and efficient to get stuff done.  Cost Specialty rolls cost around $12-18 dollars and grilled and hot stone items are generally more expensive.  Selection I would say Kabuki has a very standard sushi menu: there's plain rolls, better rolls, grill items, noodles and all that stuff. Their drink selection is not bad either, with their sake being the showcase of what to order. These bottles range from $20 to $200 so they are really into sake here. The only truly unique roll I saw was the Kabuki roll which is fitting because that's the   Overall Overall, it's honestly just sushi. You can tell this place is really catered for the general population that inhabits Tempe Marketplace. If you want good sushi in Tempe Marketplace this is the best (probably only) sushi place that gives you a diverse menu, nice atmosphere and decent sushi. I recommend all the rolls we had except for the rainbow roll unless you're not adventurous. However, if you aren't adventurous, then you might just want to stick with California rolls.",

    "text": "Kabuki is my absolute go to for sushi. I have been a customer here for about a year and and half and I absolutely love this place every single time.   The rice (sushi) is perfect! Just enough vinagre and it's at the correct temperature. Always consistent! My fiance and I always order the salmon and yellowtail nigiri to start off with. I have never liked salmon all that much before I tried it at kabuki- I would eat it but mostly avoided it. Now I can't go to this place without ordering the salmon nigiri it is so smooth and silky the flavor is amazing I've never had salmon that tasted like this before. Don't get me started on the yellowtail!! The quality of the fish is far above any sushi place I have tried in the east valley and I've been to them all on multiple occasions.   Kabuki's food is consistent 100% of the time. It's a little on the pricey side but I'm also a big believer in you get what you pay for. Can't expect quality high grade stuff for pennies right?   The best time to go to this restaurant is during the week when it's a bit slower. The weekends gets crazy busy at this location and the service will not be as quick as when you go during the week. The waitresses and waiters are always super friendly and accommodating. This is my #1 recommend sushi restaurant in the east valley without a doubt. Try the albacore crunch roll it will change your world.",

This place has been here as long as I've been in PHX. At first it was a cliche restaurant, but now it's fast becoming a staple of Temple Marketplace.  I come here often usually for drinks for Happy Hour and Reverse. Sake bombs and saketini's just keep them flowing. The food has gotten a lot better as the years have passed. Not much of a sushi guy I always say so I order their noodle dishes. Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura, Mori Soba, and my favorite Spicy Seafood Udon Pasta. The Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura for me is just a filler. The Mori Soba is definitely a summer dish for me since it's cold buckwheat noodles in a soy dipping sauce. The udon noodles is perfect -- from shrimp, mussels, and scallops with what I believe is mixed in some XO sauce -- an Asian spicy sauce. Definitely will kick some behind if you like it spicy.  Overall, the food is good and the drinks are a must in my book. Service is always on top of their game and never fails. Needless to say, Kabuki you lost me once, but now I'm back! - Enjoy!",

Yea  Ordered the rainbow roll, shrimp tempura roll, eel roll, and California roll. Boom sushi came out very fast. Very good and fresh. Really enjoyed the sushi.   I had the beef ribs, chicken teriyaki, and tempura. This came with rice and salad. Was not a real fan of the salad but was okay. The beef ribs were really good. Nice, tender, and very tasty. Tempura was nice and crispy with fresh vegetables and shrimp. Only downfall was the chicken teriyaki. Some pieces were tender and juicy and others were very dry and hard.   My wife had the eel bowl. The eel was cooked perfectly with a huge bowl of rice and vegetables.  It was pretty good.   The serve was very good. Greeted, seated, and welcomed by the server pretty quickly. Filled up the water cups regularly and got our food out pretty fast.   Enjoyed our meal here tonight but ordered too much sushi (but so good). Like I said only downfall was some of the dry chicken teriyaki. First time this has ever happened to us but this won't stop us from coming to this place.",

It's a trendy, loud, and sexy kind of vibe. The location is also perfect because after you grab a bite you can go shop, play games, or watch a movie. Kabuki has unique appetizers and a huge variety of fresh sake. My favorite roll is the dynamite roll. Be careful when ordering this though, they also have a dynamite appetizer that doesn't have the actual california roll in it. The server accidentally brought the appetizer one out, not a problem though when I let her know she kindly brought the correct one. Kabuki also has a points club. For each dollar you spend you get one point. When you get 500 points you receive a $25 credit, pretty neat! If you're looking for some fresh sushi and a cool spot to hang this is your spot. Unsure on if they have a happy hour, will update when I know.",

The servers computer was directly behind our table and in the middle of our dinner a server dropped another customers credit card down in the side of our booth where it got stuck. We had to get up and stand around for 10 min while the servers and bus boys tried to fish out this credit card. No attempt was made to reseat us or accommodate us in anyway.   Once we were able to sit back down and finish our meal we received a half hearted apology and were offered free dessert. Which after sitting there for close to 3 hours, we were not very excited about. There are so many other good sushi places in Phoenix with better food and service. My suggestion skip this place!",

The wait staff is friendly and prompt, the sushi is amazing, and their kid's meals are perfect! My only complaint is the HUGE upcharge to substitute soy paper instead of seaweed, $1.50 per roll! Soy paper is very inexpensive, it's an overpriced substitute and I took an entire star for it. I've come here on dates, with my kiddo, even all alone, and I feel like I'm pampering myself :)",

The edamame was cold which wouldn't be my first choice of temperature, but was pretty decent. Teriyaki ribs were yummy and the AAA sushi was also really good.  My only 2 complains would be the edamame temperature and that the AAA sushi is constructed in a way that every single piece separates. They might want to wrap it up with sea weed or something to keep it in one piece, just saying.   Walking around Tempe Marketplace after lunch was also super pleasant.   Can go wrong with Kabuki.

If you have a person in your party who dislikes sushi there are many options on the menu. My GF loves this place and she doesn't do sushi. The service has always been good to great. If you like unagi that dragon roll is loaded with eel. I order it every time.  The people giving this place a terrible review are either clueless on sushi, over critical prima donnas, or a pathetic combination of both. Sushi in the valley is hit or miss, Kabuki is as good as you'll find in Tempe, much better than the nightclub posing as a sushi joint on Mill Ave.",

    "text": "*Be sure to check-in here on Yelp for your FREE California Roll! *  I came here on a Friday night with a friend for an early dinner. I had seen mixed reviews about the happy hour service so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I generally try to keep an open mind about these things until I've experienced the restaurant for myself. Hey, you don't earn the Maverick badge by following the pack!   And so our culinary adventure at Kabuki began with placing our names on the wait list to build the anticipation. I take it as a good sign that this restaurant was quite busy and it was only 6:30p. We enjoyed the beautiful fall weather outside while we waited and were delighted to hear our name called within 10 minutes - much sooner than anticipated.   We were seated at a table and promptly asked for our drink order. We opened our menus and I was pleased to see there was a photo displayed for each dish, which made it hard to decide because they all looked delicious! We decided on 2 specialty rolls and a \"little baby tuna roll\" (as my friend said).   -Tuna Roll ($4.95)- 6 tiny pieces (also known as Norimaki or a \"nori roll\"): nothing special  -Sunkissed ($10.95) - Spicy tuna roll topped with Fresh Salmon and slices of avocado: decadent and delicious!  -Rainbow Roll ($11.95) - California Roll topped with fresh slices of an assortment of fish (tuna, yellow tail, salmon, shrimp): quite delicious and beautifully prepared  Overall, I was quite happy with Kabuki Japanese Restaurant. Sadly, there was no Kabuki theater performance but there are large flat screen TVs for those that want entertainment during happy hour. The server took a little while to confirm our sushi order, but he was friendly enough and came to refill our waters. He even a arranged to have the patio door closed as it was creating a draft for my friend. The sushi may not be \"fresh off the boat\" because well, where's the nearest ocean in Tempe? But the quality of the fish is certainly better than most other sushi restaurants. You'd have to venture up to Scottsdale and pay significantly more to find better sushi.",

Next, my friends ordered sushi and I ordered a chicken salad. Big mistake.  All of the sushi came out at different times, and finally at 8:25 I asked where my salad was. 8:35 the server comes back and says they accidentally cooked it with dark meat and asked if I still wanted it with white meat, to which I replied yes, I wanted it with white meat. (My friends were done eating at that point.) He then unapologetically stated that will be another 10-15 minutes.    8:50 he brings out the salad and I ask for a fork. 8:55 he comes back with cheater chopsticks and tells me they are all out of forks.  I mean REALLY?!?  Long story short, my friend stood up for me and told them to comp my salad, which they did, but the manager never came out to apologize.    And no, I did not eat my salad with chopsticks; I took it home to eat instead.  Good food.  It's a shame they have such lousy service.",

    "text": "I came here for an early lunch for the first time and it was rather good. First of all their menu is expansive, covering just about everything you could want from a restaurant specializing in Japanese food. Everything from your traditional sushi and sashimi to ramen to their take on takoyaki. We ordered a combination plate consisting of sashimi, teriaki chicken, rice, salad, miso soup, and tempura as well as the takoyaki, fresh water eel sushi, and some kind of roll the waiter suggested.   Everything was pretty delicious, all of the sauces had good flavor and the rice was well cooked with just the right amount of stick. The chicken was a tad overdone but the sauce and the somewhat smoky flavor made up for that. The sashimi was of course, off in texture (being frozen due to location which is completely understandable) and also was a bit oddly sliced; they were a bit too thick, at least for my taste. But the quality of the fish was nice. Their take on takoyaki (Soy Tako Ebi Yaki) was very good, the crisp soy paper wrapper being a good choice to offset the chew of the shrimp and octopus (both excellently cooked), I think it was my favorite part of the meal. The salad, miso soup, and tempura were all good but nothing to really write home about. The eel was very good with just the right amount of sauce. The roll the waiter suggested was not my favorite although my sister enjoyed it. It consisted of crab, rice, tuna, and another fish I can't recall set on top of siracha, japanese mayo and something else I couldn't quite put my finger on. The roll itself was good but the sauce was completely overkill for me. It could have absolutely done with a much milder hot sauce if any were to be put on it; the siracha really took away from the flavor of the other sauces and almost completely masked the fish. I wouldn't order it again.   The ambiance is nice, the waitstaff seemed knowledgeable, friendly and attentive and the seating areas inside and out were clean and aesthetically pleasing. The interior was a bit warm but I assume that is just because they had just opened when we arrived.   Over all I will be back again.",

The ambiance is cool - relaxed, dark lit, a tiny bit trendy (but by no means stuffy or overly trendy).  Our meals arrived as expected.  I would say that the meal was tasty but fairly standard.  My mixed drinks (mojitos) were a bit on the overly-sweet side so I stopped at 2 (probably best anyway, right?).  The one roll that stood out to me was the 'Geisha' roll - it was pretty damn tasty and stays in my mind.  Everything else was OK.",

To start we ordered the crispy rice app,  which never showed up and had to ask about at the end of our meal.  She said she was sorry and forgot to put the order in.    We also ordered the Lotus Roll, the first time we ate here it was our absolute favorite roll.  This time to our disappointment the lobster was under cooked and even a couple pieces were completely cold in the middle.   Next we ordered the seafood hibachi and asked if we may substitute the clams with more shrimp.  Which they said would not be a problem.  The menu pictured 6 shrimp on a skewer and they showed up with only 6 pieces.  I asked about the extra shrimp and she apologized and said she would be right back with it.  10 min later she came back and said it only comes with 4 and they added 2 more.  Then proceeded to change the subject quickly and ask my date about here hair color and advice on coloring hair.   It was just a poor experience overall.  Very disappointing for our 2nd visit and we don't really have interest in going back a third time.  Especially that location.",

    "text": "My husband and I had been going to the Kabuki in Glendale for the last 6 months and the service and quality of food had went way down within that time. We decided to try the one in Tempe and boy do we miss the Glendale location after eating here. Our waitress (Aurora) was never any where to be found, we were sat prior to another table of hers and she told us she would be back took the other tables orders left and then came back and took ours, they were served and given their meals prior to us when we were seated before them. It took her over 10 min just to bring us edamame, refills were not given unless we asked (when we actually saw her), a few times we had to ask other waiters for things as well as the hostess. When we finally got our order the rolls were not wrapped tight, the albacore was pieced together on the rolls, the baja rolls had very little baja sauce and we had to ask for more and the California rolls were falling apart just as we grabbed them. When we spoke to the manager (Zhen) he pretty much showed in his expression and his responses that he was not interested in anything we were telling him claimed they were busy and they definitely were not especially when other tables were getting extremely good service. He took the rolls off of our bill however I would never recommend going to the Tempe location again.",

Sesame chicken: cut small,  crispy, delicious but maybe was over cooked. Tokyo mojito: get cucumber version. Food and drinks were yummy.  I'd go back again.",

The ingredients seem semi fresh, but there are definitely way better places in the valley if you are looking for delicious sushi. My suggestions: Ra, Blue Wasabi or Squid Ink (depending on which part of the valley you are in).  If for some reason my review hasn't changed your mind from going and you find yourself at Kabuki DO NOT order the Sangria, you WILL BE disappointed. As for the food -- I guess there are worse places you could go.",

The next time we would see her was when she gave us our checks while we were in the middle of eating. She did not serve us our food, some else did. That would be the last time we saw her. She did not check on us once. We literally saw her twice. Then we waited for 15+ minutes for our checks to be taken when she said whenever we were ready. Fortunately randy was there to cash us out. I am genuinely disappointed by my experience at Kabuki. The food was amazing but the service, not so much. Not sure if I ever would go back.",

The hostess sat us in the corner where the blinds were still closed and I had to get up to ask for the sushi menu they didn't do the obvious and supply one when we were seated! On top of that my wife got ice tea and she added her lemon and spun it that's when she noticed there was stuff floating around, we asked the waitress and she said \" she thinks it could be particles from the tea, but wasn't to sure\"! The sushi was the only good thing about our experience here today.",

Four of our group went to Kabuki around 11 AM on a Monday.  Lisa was our server and she was outstanding giving us recommendations and keeping up with all our needs throughout the meal. I also noticed that she had two other tables of regulars at the time which speaks to the service she provides.  A new menu was rolled out for 2016 and I can't speak about the differences from 2015, but I do know that the menu size did not decrease and there was a focus on small plates and hot stone grill entrees. I ordered the garlic chili salmon poke bowl ($11.95) which consisted of many tasty ingredients that all seemed to work together, especially the garlic chili sauce with the salmon. Along with the accompanying bowl of soup, this was enough to fill me up. Another surprise was the kid's meals ($6.50-$7.50). They must have designed these meals for baby hippos because they were gargantuan and included a salad, rice, and a drink. Needless to say, none of the kids came close to finishing their meal. Also ordered was the tempura udon ($11.95).  Prices are slightly elevated and it was busy during our lunch, but the service or food quality were not sacrificed. I'd have no problem returning, especially with such a large menu left to sample.",

The food was okay, not the best Japanese food, but the plating and some styling were actually closer to Japanese/Asian food than Americanized Japanese cuisine. There were also some dishes on the menu that are pretty authentic Japanese.  The garlic beef and ishiyaki were good, but the latter had a small portion (but normal for authentic Japanese food, just not American size :P). The quality were pretty good. However the miso soup came with most meals were basically water with miso flavor D: It was so lacking in miso that was almost hilarious.... The hot stone for ishiyaki lost heat pretty quickly, which never happened when I ordered something similar in the past (mostly in Asia), maybe they used a different type of stones.  Service was polite but they were so busy that everything required a wait.",

The only time we would get any attention was by waiving him down ourselves. Our experience may have been differ if we don't come here on a busy weekend. Hostesses were friendly though.   We ordered a spicy tuna roll and it was just ok. Garlic Edamame was delicious and the cucumber eel roll was average. Overall, I'm not impressed. I did, however, enjoy the mojito with cherry flavor.

Sat down, took our server a while to come over and ask us for drinks even though we hadn't been given a drink menu. We immediately put in an order for 3 sushi rolls (rainbow and two spicy tuna - nothing crazy). When he came back we gave our drink order. Nothing for 10 minutes or so, until he came by for our order. Placed that, another 15 minutes goes by and no sushi. Another 10. He comes by and vaguely mentions the kitchen is busy and he has no idea when our rolls are coming but there's nothing he can do. Another 15 minutes goes by and they bring our the miso soup and salad that accompanied two of the entrees. After 15 more minutes two of the entrees arrive. These feature raw zucchini and broccoli drowning in ranch on the side - very odd. The waiter walks by every 5 minutes or so and doesn't stop, mind you. We finally grab him and ask if we can just cancel our sushi order at this point and he says \"yea, sure\". After another 10 minutes the other two entrees come out. These were both unagi bowls, which were fairly good themselves. When we finally manage to grab our waiter again for the bills, he says nothing until we've handed him the cards and he says, \"oh yea and sorry for the wait guys\". Overall, bad experience and we will never come back.",

    "text": "09/30/2018  Yelp review Kabuki Japanese Restaurant Tempe AZ 2000 E Rio Salado Pkwy #1051 (480) 350-9160  Kabuki Japanese restaurant is one of the best Sushi I have ever had. Clearly the most reasonable prices with high-end Sushi.  I went to Kabuki two years ago and have been only going there when I am in Tempe. The restaurant is located in the Tempe Marketplace which is a really nice mall with restaurants, movie theatres, and shopping outlets. The mall itself has a very peaceful vibe and Kabuki knows how to match that. As you enter the restaurant, there is a counter with welcoming faces ready to get you seated. The lighting is just perfect and sets the mood. Most places include bars within the sitting area, however, Kabuki separated the bar with the restaurant which brings in the peaceful ambiance and helps makes it easier for the servers to help everyone.   Our server was welcoming and suggested some great dishes as I was a first timer. We started with the House Sake and some appetizers. There is something for everyone at Kabuki, they consider all the dietary restrictions and offer suggestions accordingly. We moved the order to Sushi and this was the actual test. They have so many options from rolls to nigiri. It was overwhelming but after spending some time talking to the server, we ended up with a variety of rolls, tuna poke, and noodles. Everything came just in time (under 15 minutes), and the food looked amazing. The presentation was top notch and I could tell that the people really care about how the food looks. The taste matched the presentation and was above my expectations, I loved the spice level of some items, and how authentic the overall experience was.  In terms of service, I was really impressed because we did not have to ask for anything extra as the servers were considerate enough to provide everything, and were on top of dirty dishes, napkins, water refills, and drinks etc. We stayed for an hour and a half and had a few more drinks after the food.   When it comes to authentic Japanese food, most restaurants are expensive, and you could tell that the Sushi itself is just too expensive for the price. Kabuki on the other side is comparatively cheap at reasonable prices and has great tasting food. For two people, including drinks the total bill came up to $40 including taxes, this is because we ordered drinks too, but for food only, it is not very expensive. It is, however, not the cheapest Japanese restaurants either because of the location, ambiance, and service. The billing method is super easy, every server carries a billing device with them and you can pay while sitting at your table, however, the tip has to be added at that time in front of the server, which may make some people uncomfortable.   The restaurant itself has different branches in Arizona, but the Tempe Marketplace one has the best service and the food is also well cooked. I also tried to sit at the Sushi bar on one of my recent visits and the staff is super nice and friendly. In conclusion, Kabuki is the perfect date place due to the atmosphere and the lighting. I am always excited to eat there and have a delightful experience.",

At the end of our meal, our server (who was nice our entire visit) brought a hand held credit card payment system to the table, and we had to pay *and* tip right in front of the him, while he stood there looking down at us. I certainly don't think he was trying to make us feel any kind of pressure, but nonetheless, it was an admittedly weird and awkward. We were still finishing our meals and conversation and it felt like we kind of had to stop talking because he was just standing there as we both paid our tabs. Another not so awesome take-away: I noticed when I got home my hands were really swollen, so I had to take off my rings. This only happens when I eat something that has way too much salt.",

We were seated right away, as it was early afternoon. I usually opt in for Ramen or Sushi, but went out on a whim and tried their Beer Sukiyaki, and OMG was it devine. We had just come from volunteering all morning and the meal most definitely hit the spot. Friends got Ramen and Salmon, both looked great, but I was extremely content with my meal! Great value and awesome staff. Dustin was our server and awesome at answering all our questions!",

    "text": "Kabuki is a cool sushi spot in Tempe Marketplace.  We hadn't been in a while, and ended up in the area at dinner time tonight.  Ordered some Nigiri and some rolls.    The Hamachi was really great tonight.  The Sake and Maguro were also good.  The gals wanted a Dynamite roll, an Alaskan, and a couple of crunchy things, and the guys ordered the Fiery Lotus (or something like that) to get something spicy.  The rolls were tasty (but I'm still more of a Nigiri guy).  Service was great, and Edamame came to the table without us even asking.  That was a nice touch.  Good spot - if you're in the neighborhood of the Marketplace and have a hankering for sushi, or for general Japanese fare, give Kabuki a try!",

    "text": "Kabuki Japanese Restaurant is a great place to go before catching a movie at the Harkins Tempe Theater.  Park on the Northwest of Kabuki and finding a parking spot won't be so difficult, then take a nice walk through the outdoor mall to your movie.  There is so much to talk about Kabuki.  Whether going for a business meeting, lunch, happy hour, meeting relatives and friends or to have a nice dinner with your spouse, Kabuki is a great place with an awesome atmosphere.    I won't lie, my wife and I go to Kabuki quite a bit.  In all, I think we are addicted to eating out.  We used to try and eat out once or twice a week, but it is getting harder and harder as the Phoenix area is gaining such good restaurants.  Kabuki is one of these restaurants.    My wife -  She always orders the oriental chicken salad, her favorite menu item at Kabuki by far. If we go during happy hour, her excuse is, \"The salad costs the same as if I buy two happy hour items.\" She will tell you to order both the ginger and sesame dressing.    Happy Hour - I used to just order two spicy tuna rolls, but now I also have to order the Broiled Mussels on Half Shell.  Here and there I will pickup a Gyoza Dumplings, Seaweed Salad, Sesame Chicken, Fire Cracker, actually I will quit there because I will order everything.    For Lunch - I like to eat spicy tuna roll and a salmon roll.  Just a good meal and a lite lunch.  All other times - My favorite is the Omakase Deluxe.  The Omakase Deluxe is a spicy tuna roll with a wide variety of Nigiri.  If I am not too hungry, I will order a Kabuki Roll.  I will eat the variety or toppings on the kabuki roll as sashimi first, and then the bottom roll separate.    The food is always great and our order is always right.  I have read many reviews and we just haven't experienced the same problems.  Kabuki seems to run a tight ship.  I have yet to find a perfect place, but Kabuki is 5 stars.  With how many times I have been to Kabuki, I imagine they have made a mistake once or twice, but like most places they make it right.    I do enjoy being a member of the Kabuki Red Mask Club.  We earn free meals and get our occasional anniversary and birthday discounts.    Why is the food good at Kabuki?  The answer - The food is fresh and tastes great.  Give it a try, don't judge the restaurant by the people sitting next to you or if they make a mistake.  Judge Kabuki by what they have created and what they offer.",

Last night I ordered The Kabuki Roll, which is an assortment of sushi and I was pleasantly surprised.  The dish's description says that they are spicy crunch rolls, and I am not a fan of spicy sushi, but there were only a couple pieces that were spicy.  (Ate those first!)   I would definitely order the Kabuki Roll again.  Also, I ordered the onigiri, which was also good.   I have also ordered the seafood udon in the past. I'll be back soon!",

I kept my order very simple to hopefully get something safe & tolerable; a rainbow roll, spider roll, asparagus, and iced tea.    The unforgettable part of the meal was the rainbow roll. All of the fish were room temp to the touch with piece of fish cut jagged, falling off the roll, dried & discolored in some spots.  2 of the sections were completely inedible and I wasnt going to risk getting sick eating warm dry fish.  Honestly i was surprised a sushi chef would even consider serving sushi in that condition.  So gross.  Everything else ordered was just average or subpar.  Kabuki, Never again.    There is great sushi to be had in the area, but it's not going to be found at this restaurant.",

It was a pleasant surprise being served w a small plate of edamame while we wait for our appetizers. The pretty Asian server we had (i didn't get her name) was genuinely friendly & accommodating. The Philadelphia roll was fantastic. The only thing negative was my boyfriend had a cooked dish of, I think beef, but they piled it up w so much greens on his plate & only small slices of the meat. As much as I enjoyed my rolls, I don't think he did on his food. He doesn't eat raw fish but he took me there bec I love sushi. I didn't see bento boxes. But I know this place serves cooked asian dishes too. We will be back for the rolls. Promise:)",

Our waiter took our order promptly (even though apologized for arriving to our table late because of a mix up of some sorts) and we had our beers, sake, and sushi out to us in a flash.  As fast as our food arrived, it disappeared. It tasted great and the presentation was spot-on. When we realized our plates were almost empty and our stomachs still weren't at maximum capacity, we ordered supplementary sushi. To our surprise, it appeared before us within 2 minutes (aka before the last pieces of sushi vanished from before us). Our conclusion was that either our waiter was a wizard or Kabuiki was just on its game. In both scenarios, we won - prompting me to give them a much deserved 5 stars.",

My daughter ordered a few sushi rolls, and those were not very fresh tasting. Even your basic California roll tasted as if we found it at your local grocery store. Very basic.  I ordered the teriyaki salmon, and that came with a small bowl of rice, your choice of white or brown, a side salad and a bowl of luke warm broth (soup).  Absolutely none of that got my tastebuds excited!  We had a few appetizers as well. We ordered the mixed Tempura, and some kind of Japanese quesadilla. They were very minimal and basic, if ordering appetizers for a big party, I'd go with ordering 2 or more of the same thing, because the quesadilla appetizer came with 5 small pieces and the mixed Tempura came with a Handful of mixed veggies and one shrimp.   Overall, it was not worth the price for the value of what we got and we will not be coming back.",

Very little flavor and very greasy.  Spicy tuna tempura roll- THEY fried it so long that it cooked the spicy tuna& made it dry. I asked them to remake it unfried and it was better.  There is no rice in it so it was all flavor but no spice.   Hamaki sake roll- this is a square roll. Which I thought would be good but it just feel apart.  Too much rice and not enough filling/meat. The sauce on the side was good though.   Fried tofu- awesome!! I LOVE this dish though this order the tofu could have been more firm.  Grilled asparagus- theses were just ok.  Seaweed salad- always good because you can't screw it up.  Wontons w/kale mustard & honey tofu dressing- wontons were good.  Kale mustard had great flavor. I could eat that with hummus & pita. The honey tofu would be good on fruit because it was very sweet and runny.",

    "text": "Kabuki is my first choice to dine together with my friends, and I came here about twice a month. There has a theater nearby so we usually come here after watching a movie in weekend. The outdoor seating is my favorite part of this restaurant located in Tempe marketplace. It's really enjoyable when sit in the couch and chat with your friends beside the bonfire. This restaurant is really popular and it usually get a long line of customers in meal time but worth it. The space inside is huge and all the environment inside are elaborately decorated. I like the sushi bar especially because it's so stylish and gives me a visual sense of Japanese culture.  The light effect looks pretty good and the seats are arranged perfectly. Although there have lots of chairs and tables, I don't feel crowded. The waiters and waitress in Kabuki all wear black gives me sense of professional, they serve really good and they pay attention to all our process of meal, like refill on drinks and give us more napkins when we need. They are so nice that we even don't need to raise our hand up to let them know we need to be served. They always have a smile on their face and ask if everything goes okay. For the drinks, I have to say their lemonade is really authentic, the flavor tastes mild and open up my appetite. There is plenty on the menu that you can eat and the images on menu looks exactly same as the dishes come up, good-looking and appetitive.          As always, Kabuki serves us side of free edamame while we waiting for our dishes, and these edamame taste really good. For the dishes, I really recommend the firecracker roll. We can add wasabi and the soy sauce to make our own flavor and these sauce tastes very fresh. For the firecracker roll, this roll stacked with a piece of salmon and it has a crisp lotus root piece and jalapeno, on the sides it's lined with crunchy panko crumbs and mayonnaise based hot sauce. It is so delicious and I like it so much. The price level is like $15-$30 per capita depends on what we order. Rolls cost around $10-$20 and some grilled entrees are generally expensive. I recommend consumers to order happy hour rolls since that's way cheaper. Furthermore, the servers are deserved high tips because of their patience and nice touch. I expect to see more new dishes come out because I've almost tasted all of the dishes except the sakes. Hope to see more creativity on dishes.  Overall, the quality of food, drinks, both exterior and interior design, atmosphere and service are all make me fully satisfied and I have great experiences each time there, if you are interested in choosing a Japanese theme restaurant for lunch or dinner, consider Kabuki, it's a great spot for gathering with your family and friends, definitely worth going back to.",

This place is huge, and I mean huge for a quality Sushi Bar. First upon walking in and seeing the size I assumed it would be 3 stars at best. Not so. Very good Sushi with a large creative menu. Service was good as was the Sushi choices at our table. Our selections came out much quicker than expected considering the complexity of making our particular orders.",

How can it be so awful one day, and decent the next?   Perhaps it's the people actually preparing the food! Taste what comes out of the kitchen if you own this place...fire the people who can't hack it.  Also, once again - The servers were dicks.  I notice MANY of the people that love this place are into the \"fried\" this and the \"tempura\" that, or worse yet...Teriyaki Chicken.   Word to the wise, if you want a Traditional Sushi experience i.e. - Raw Fish --- this might not be your best bet.",

I regularly go there for happy hour - they have a pretty good selection of drinks, appetizers, and sushi. Some of the items I regularly get are the mozzarella tempura, the firecracker, gyoza, and the bbq beef ribs. Their dinners are also good - bento boxes are the best! The only reason why I can't give Kabuki 5 stars is due to their service. We go there a lot and it's really hit or miss with the servers - some are great, others are so-so.",

    "text": "The GOOD: Decent interior design obviously aimed for ambiance at night. During the day, the light tends to take on a cafeteria feel. The facility and restrooms were clean, even though it was happy hour and there was a 20 minute wait to be seated.   The bar area is designed well and a nice place to sit and have a drink while waiting for a table to open. The televisions weren't too loud so it was easy to talk without the need to raise your voice. The sofas aren't that comfortable so it's clear that they really aren't meant for long, intimate conversations. Was an overall okay experience.   The staff is amazing. All were friendly and smiling despite the fact that it was happy hour and there was a waiting list. Everyone was presentable and appeared to be on point. Our server was confident, helpful and very pleasant.   The SO-SO: This establishment served our edamame cold and unsalted. While this is considered tradition for some, it is not my personal favorite. Nearly all of it went to waste.   The sushi roll variety.....well, there isn't much of one. It's mainly variations of the same  ingredients. Something fried, something raw, cream cheese, cucumber, avocado........there were a few other items offered as well, but that was pretty much it. They also offer what appeared to be a full hot menu which I didn't try simply because I was there specifically for sushi. This IS a Japanese restaurant so perhaps their popularity is from that side of the menu.   The BAD: The sushi sucked. Seriously. The oversized rolls were disproportionately stuffed with rice and had very little sushi. This actually ended up being a saving grace considering the sushi itself was NOT chilled, had a fishy odor and was slimy. HORRIBLE. The appetizer of deep fried calamari was served 10 mins AFTER the sushi arrived. It was NOT hot but was quasi warm. The unsweetened tea was light in color and was either watered down or not steeped long enough.   With all the positive reviews, it makes me wonder as to people's expectations. Is the bar set so low that this establishment is considered fine dining? Was this an off night for the chef? Is this experience True to the chain's standard or was this less than fantastic waste of time a direct reflection on the management of this particular location?   I will not be back.",

    "text": "Came here with my son and husband on Saturday night, it was our first time dining here. We don't live in the valley and are used to California sushi. In comparison to our experiences here I give Kambuki a 3.5. I found the rolls good sized but not as fresh tasting as I would have liked. I liked the variety of fun rolls and we definitely had our fill.   The ambience was really nice inside, like most things in this area of town the restaurant is huge with plenty of seating. It was dimly lit and nice inside.  A few highlights for me- the white wine I ordered was deliciously cold. I hate getting a warm glass of wine.   Our server, Gina, was perfectly professional and attentive. She really enhanced the experience.  On the flip side, I mentioned the rolls were just so-so, nothing amazing. It doesn't mean we didn't like them, they just didn't blow us away.  The restaurant was at least 80 degrees inside- very uncomfortable. Another reason I was grateful for that cold glass of wine. We asked to dine outside but they quoted us a wait despite it being early in the evening and plenty of open tables on the patio (weird). We should have waited a few mins to sit outside.  We'll probably be back when visiting the area, I wouldn't stay away from here.",

I ordered a sushi roll and I wanted them to put mango slices on the side because I enjoy eating mango and scallops together. The chef told the server that if he put mango in the scallop roll then it was going to be awful and that if I didn't like it I could not return it. I had no intention of returning any food. So I asked if the Chef would just put the mango slices on the side and serve it as a side dish. The Chef told the server absolutely not that he would not do it even if I paid extra. So even though the service was wonderful I will not be returning to this restaurant over a few mango slices. Not to mention they no longer serve ahi tuna. Really?",
