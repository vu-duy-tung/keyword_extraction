With that being said, I ordered the Arriba pollo con queso, and let me tell you what, it was delightful. The chicken was tender, juicy, and it was topped with a delicious jalapeno cream cheese.

This is the place with the cheesy commercials about \"hatch chili's makin' it hot!\" that remind me of old Chi-Chi's commercials. Huge disappointment.  The salsa was decent but the tortilla chips greasy and bland; the spinach enchiladas were okay but small; the black beans, rice, and salad boring. Plus they had the nerve to charge $1.99 for sour cream and $2.49 for guacamole.   Finally, Robert Irvine would have flipped over the fact that the appetizer/desert menu on the table was filthy!  You know, I've lived in the Great American Southwest for 5-1/2 years and I'm only 162 miles from the Mexican border... I have never had a truly awesome Mexican meal here. Decent but never awesome. Weird. How I miss Mad Mex back in the Burgh...",

Not sure what all of the negative comments are, but this is my favorite Mexican restaurant. The lunch specials are to die for. And is the valley's best-kept secret. Where else in the country can you order a full meal - complete with entree, rice and beans - for a mere $4.99...nowhere !!  Throw-in the unlimited warm bowl of chips and salsa/bean dip and you're in Heaven.   Alvin, the manager is always kind and friendly, and greets us whenever we are there 3x/wk. We're always the only Asian couple there, yet we prefer Mexican over Chinese due to the immense cooking oils and MSG preservatives used in Asian cooking. And Arriba's gives you large portions so we're always satisfied and full when we leave.   Arriba's is always open and receptive to our requests; such as to customize our order so  that there is less cheese or is completely substituted for healthier black beans;  or the chimichanga converted as a fresh burrito instead of it deep-fried. etc....we love it !!  It's a healthy alternative.   Thanks Arriba's for being an asset to the community. And for continuous loyalty in satisfying our palate with all the love and flavors of Old Mexico.",

Our waitress showed up within minutes of being seated and we ordered just waters to drink...sounded good since it was so hot in there.  Well, just over 10 minutes later a busboy notices we are still waiting for our waters so asks what we ordered and immediately gets them for us.  5 minutes later our waitress finally comes back and takes our order.  Another server then brings us our food.  It's not busy at all in the restaurant so not sure what our waitress is doing but it's definitely not helping us.  The 3rd and final time we saw her, was to bring us our bill.  The food was good but not good enough to go back get that service again.",

My girlfriend and I came in and we hadn't realized they had changed their hours, so in advance being there 30 min before they closed I get it. My bean dip came out ice cold, I asked for them to warm it up, our waitress grabbed it and brought it back and just kind threw it. Also, didn't get any refills on any of my drinks and I did order a appetizer of fundido dip and well it came out slightly warm/room temperature. The chorizo on the top was cold and hard as a rock. She didn't even ask us how everything was so far.. The chips were also just cold and very chewy they weren't cooked fully. My dinner, came out well room temperature/warm. My girlfriend meat was cold, looked like it had been hanging out on their grill in the back. When I walked into the establishment it was very humid, and like I said originally I'm pretty good and reasonable when it comes to the food industry. Overall, I have been in the same situation before and of course I would be a little bothered but I always gave my best effort and made sure everything was still a pleasant experience as well as the food being up to par when I worked in the industry. We are guests and paying for the food, the least you can do is make sure we are enjoying our dinner ? I was still very polite saying \"thank you\", \"please\", our typical manners we all are shown growing up. She just walked away, dropped things off and tossed them. So plot twist now.... I use to work for the company a couple years ago so I'm well aware of how things are prepared and how the flow is at Ariba's Mexican grill.",

Host sat us I'm bar section-no complaints about that-closer to the drinks!  Fifteen minutes into our visit, I remember why. At that point, we still were waiting for someone to come take a drink order and give us chips and salsa.   While perusing the menu, I note one thing that is always super annoying to me at this Arriba location. There is NO drink menu. Stupid. Finally get our drink order and chips and it's easily another 10 before she's back to take order. She gave the kiddo his soda and us our water-still no Bud Light and house margarita. Good came in decent amt of time, served by another server. She was prompt responding to our request for more chips. Other than that, we saw our server (who was also bartender apparently) a grand total of 5 times even though we had empty drinks and the need for additional napkins. We saw her more walking past our table than we did AT it. BTW, the place was at least half empty when we arrived. And while we had no issue with sitting in bar area, I did overhear another party comment that they were surprised to sit in bar. The host response was, \"This is a section and we have to sit people here\". If you truly have such hard and fast rules in a food service joint, you are certain to upset customers. Anyway, the rest of our dinner was equally slow. My food was so unmemorable I hardly remember what I had. Not bad. Not good. But the service was pretty freakin bad and therefore, I will patronize other better Mexican places in the Tuk on the few occasions the mood strikes.",

I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of guacamole that we received.  Always a good start to a mexican meal.  Our food came out within 15 minutes of order. I had the triple enchilada plate. I enjoyed my enchiladas (beef, cheese and chicken). The plate was big and flavorful.  I could have gone for another enchilada!   The most disappointing part of the meal was the rice and beans. The rice/beans didn't have the best taste and easily the most disappointing part of the meal.  Not sure if that is the normal taste or just had an old/bad batch.  Service was very good.    Arriba is very kid friendly and a festive atmosphere.  Not the best mexican food, but slightly above average, close to home, affordable and nice atmosphere. We'll be back for these reasons.  3.5",

Ok, first I had to make a pit stop, but then it was time to pen my thoughts and aspir... ooooh hoooold on, brb...  Now, where was I.  Here's a fun fact... the human body can hold up to a quarter of its own weight in disposable fluids, whose liberation can be mobilized by Arriba's own spinach enchiladas.  Ole!  That's right, the green leafy vegetable made famous by a marble-mouthed sailor, now compels me to blow my own ballast tanks... again and again  But I have to say, this couldn't have come at a better time, with tomorrow being the inaugurate outing of my office's hiking group.  Magic 8 Ball says \"Signs point to yes\" that I'll collapse 27 minutes into the trek from dehydration, and possibly require professional extrication.  You know what doesn't require professional extrication?  The cauldron of dysentery brewing in my lower GI.  Spiiiicy!  But to be fair, its not all waterloo, Arriba's.  I really should thank you for lightening my load, even though I've really never felt more bloated and irritated.  *quizzical look*  And if I ever nurture the desire to tarry in your cantina, which is somewhat reminiscent of The Blue Oyster on tango night, I'll be sure not to waste the opportunity, and schedule that pesky colonoscopy for the following morning.  Osmoprep's got nutin on you, honey.  Montezuma's revenge me once, shame on you.  Montezuma's revenge me twice... we wont get fooled again",

My coworker cut into her chimichanga to discover a huge piece of plastic (presumably some type of plastic wrap from food packaging). Our waitress got her a new chimi, but when the bill came, they didn't even comp it. The also charge extra for sour cream and guacamole, 99 cents and $1.99 each respectively AFTER what they said was half price. My lunch was a mediocre quesadilla that was over $13 after tax-- extremely overpriced for lunch and considering the quality of the food. This place gets a hard pass.",

We found several open seats at the bar and had only been sitting a moment when the manager came over and asked us to leave. She told us the entire restaurant was on a waitlist, even the bar. She didn't offer to add us to the list or ask if we were just having drinks; she just told us we couldn't sit there and needed to leave. It's been a few years since I have been here and now I remember why. Zero stars would be more appropriate since we had zero experience.",

    "text": "We used to go there for lunch regularly but hadn't been there for a couple years, so it sounded good.  We were sat and after a little waiting and confusion about who our waiter was supposed to be we were brought chips and salsa and beans.  They were standard, okay.  I used to like this place because they had some spicy items, but zero spice in the salsa.  Should have asked for some hot sauce, which I think they used to automatically bring, but maybe not.  When ordering I asked if the green or the red burro was hotter.  I used to be a waiter in a Mexican restaurant and I realize neither is really hot, but sometimes one might have a little kick.  The waiter said the red, so I ordered that.  In the picture the lunch green/red burrito was enchilada style, so I thought mine would have the red sauce on top.  When he brought it out it was kind of a puny burrito and no sauce.  I asked about the topping and he said that was how it comes, but when I said the picture on the lunch special had enchilada sauce he was nonplussed and just said he could bring a side of the sauce if I'd like.  It's not the same when it's not baked on top with melted cheese so I said that it wouldn't be necessary.   Cutting into my burrito it was immediately apparent that it was a machaca burrito, not red chili.  It was lunch and I didn't have time for a re-do so I just ate it.  Server brought our check without clearing the table.  Also, the table was a bit dirty and one of the knives and a plate had schmeg on them.  All in all what I saw was a restaurant in decline, and badly in need of competent management.    I really hate giving bad reviews, so I'm hoping they read this and some of the other bad reviews that have been popping up and make some changes for the better.  Their hatch chili items are delicious, and there aren't too many Mexican places with good heat in their menu, so I really hope they work things out.",

Those were your standard Mexican food restaurant chips and salsa so not bad but nothing special. The bar had Bud Light and Dos Equis on draft so I went with XX. The bartender first poured the beer into a shaker then, poured the beer into a cold mug. After that, I saw him do the same with a Bud Light but instead of pouring the beer into the mug, he went to the freezer, where their bottled beers are and grabbed a pitcher and poured the guy's beer from there. He then poured the beer from the shaker into the pitcher. I asked the bartender why and he explained their draft lines were all messed up and the beer was too foamy. I guess that explains why my beer was so flat. There are plenty of other bar options in the area. I won't be going back.",

    "text": "Holy crap this place is awful. My boyfriend and I stopped in around 11:00 this morning to grab a bite to eat before getting some shopping done. It wasn't busy at all, maybe a hand full of tables. The hostess greeted us pretty much right away and was very nice. She sat us in the bar area, just a few feet from the bar itself. The chips, salsa and bean dip came out pretty quickly and that seems to be where the decent service ended. We saw a few employees and the manager walking around but pretty much ignoring us. One of the servers who had been shuffling (literally shuffling. Would not pick her feet up when she walked) around walked by our table several times while coughing and apparently trying to hack something up (So. Gross.). We watched her walk over to the bar, right next to open containers of limes and lemons and cough all over everything. Didn't even attempt to cover her mouth. It was so ridiculous that it was almost comical and I looked at my boyfriend and said \"Oh my God please don't let that be our server.\" Jinxed. Not 15 seconds later she shuffled up to our table. She didn't greet us or tell us her name or even smile for that matter. She looked so irritated with the idea of helping us and just said \"What can I get you to drink?\". My boyfriend and I both ordered waters and I also ordered a mimosa. She walked the whole 10 steps to the bar, got our waters and put them on the table without saying another word and just walked away. Another 15 minutes passed and the bartender came over to take our order. She didn't appear to be as annoyed as the 1st server but she wasn't exactly friendly. I still hadn't gotten my mimosa and pretty much realized that the 1st server hadn't even put the order in. I ended up just getting a Pepsi and we ordered our food. During the 20 minutes we waited for our meals, we continued to see employees walking around but not helping anyone (not to even ask if we wanted refills), the busser who brought us more chips had earbuds in and never said a word to us. We thanked him and he turned away without even looking at us. So unprofessional. The shuffling server went over to the bar twice to pick up drinks that had been just sitting there for 10-15 minutes. Our food came out and looked delicious but was anything but. My boyfriend got the breakfast skillet which was 80% onions. I ordered the 2 enchilada plate with shredded chicken. The rice was dry and completely inedible, the beans were ok but I was only given a couple tablespoons of them. The enchiladas seemed ok at 1st but they were drowning in sauce so it was hard to taste anything else. I got to the middle of the 1st one and noticed the chicken looked pink. I thought maybe it was thigh meat that had been close to the bone. I took another bite and noticed the flavor was off so out of an abundance of caution, I opened up the enchilada to check and there was a ton of pink meat. I opened up the 2nd enchilada and noticed the same thing. I just stopped eating at that point. Our server brought our check over and said \"I don't want to rush you but I'm gonna go ahead and leave this here so you're not waiting on me.\" Well that would have been really thoughtful if not for the fact that it took her 15-20 minutes to come back and pick up our card. Now to top off the whole thing, I've been throwing up since about an hour after we left there. Horrible service, disgusting food and now vomiting. I have no idea how this place it still open. And whoever the manager was, was clearly more interested in following the hostess around everywhere than actually checking in on his customers. He has no business being a manager. Eating gas station sushi would have been a safer choice than this dump.",

They can't even describe their items properly so you never know what you are going to end up with. They called it a pepper dish and it was a pork dish. The sauce apparently contained pulverized peppers. Are they stupid?  I should have trusted my instincts & not the commercial.  It's a third world country. They can barely afford to feed themselves. They have no history of cuisine.  I wouldn't waste my time and money on this place again.",

Once you sit down, you'll get tasty, hot tortilla chips, flavorful salsa and bean dip. My husband & I normally order a carne asada burro, chicken con queso, chicken burrito and cheese crisp. Everything is made to order, so if don't like green or red sauce, you are good to go. I like their chicken dishes because the chicken has flavor and is not mushy. I hate going to a Mexican restaurant  & find their salsa is a can of tomato sauce & some red pepper flakes - you won't find that here! We go to Garcia's (marginal) amd my kids like Casa Reynoso (I'd rather eat dirt!) and I hate that I waste my money at these so-called \"authentic Mexican\" restaurants when you can find much better food! Give Arriba's a try! We go to the Arriba's in Chandler at least once per month and have always had great service.",

Grande margarita ( house mix) was giant for $6 but I would have preferred my buddies flat beer. Nice size but nit very good and certainly not worth 1000 calories!!!    I drink a lot of slim-priced booze & was still not impressed.   chips average, salsa bland, refried beans were the only added pleasure.    Dinner:  my friend was not psyched with the cheese skin that arrived with his enchiladas. Creamy? yes, Shiny with weird skin?  Yes, Good?  No.   Combo plate with green corn tamale was dry. Chicken enchilada was pretty good and seemed to have s lot of pepper seasoning. Thank god I asked for green sauce which saved the tamale. Rice and charro beans typical & moist.    In a nutshell, when should have taken heed from the yelp 2 star reviews.  Food was less than average. Much better quality, pricing and taste at Chipoltle.",

Today was one of the worst experiences Ive had in any restaurant because of the lack of service from our server. She didn't give us her name and can only be identified as African American and middle aged. She approached us without a greeting and asked for our drink order. When she brought out our salsa we all chimed thank you and she walked away without saying anything. She brought our food over and didn't say a word and not once asked us how we were doing. We had to ask the busser for more beans and a to-go plate because she was nowhere to be found and trust me, it wasn't because it was a busy night. When she came to drop off the check she put it down on the table without even a glance at anyone, as if the sight of us offended her. My family is Asian and my boyfriend is Hispanic and when he went to ask her for a working pen (because she left us one that didnt work) she was kind to him and even called him \"sweetie\". I'd like to think that we progressed more as a society, but in this circumstance it makes me believe that we received such poor service because we were Asian. We were polite the entire time, not complicated, and not loud at all so I don't understand why she treated us so poorly when we came to this place to have a good dining experience. I am hesitant to continue my business at this establishment if this is the kind of people you hire.",

    "text": "Went with my family.  At first we were not impressed and slightly nervous about eating here. While walking to the bathrooms upon first getting here I slipped on a wet spot on the floor.  I quickly notified a waitress and they cleaned it up.  Then entering the bathroom discovered floors covered in over spilling trash.  Again I notified management and they thank us and quickly took care of the problem.  We asked for a table but were walked to a booth.  We ordered raspberry tea and asked what other drinks they had.  Our server stated to us they were out of the raspberry tea and offered strawberry. Declining that flavor I went with just water.  I order the White Sand Chimi, My son ordered the Steak Tampico.  Attempted to get Menudo, but strangely enough for a mexican rest. they do not have any. The salsa and bean dip was great.  the salsa had a bite to it but the flavor was good.  getting our order served took a good 20-30 minutes.  The waitress was great and took good care of our needs as we waited.Once we got our meal, the food itself was delicious!  I thought I would burst from the large amount I consumed, but I couldn't help myself.  My tongue burning from the spiciness but my mouth kept saying \"more, more\".  Upon walking out I noticed yet another large wet spot on the floor.  Usually I wouldn't mention it but as I discovered when that floor was wet it was very slick. I give them 4 stars because the product the have is wonderful they just need to work on some of the esthetics.  Maybe it truly does represent a little hole in the wall rest. in Mexico.  If you like a kick to your food and really great tastes i truly suggest trying Arriba's.",

The only thing that was good was the chips and salsa.We were there on a Sunday noonish and it was not too packed our server only had one other table. There were 5 of us and only 1 set of silverware and had to ask about 6 times for extra silverware and napkins! Our drink order took forever to come however our food came out right away! All I can say is the microwave was not working right because most of our food was really hot on the edges and cold in the middle! Also after asking several times only two of us ever got our drinks refilled! The waitress also kept stacking our dirty dishes up at the end of the table and never took any of them away!  One person in our party also ordered desert, mini-apple chimmi's with ice cream, they're were 4 total and two of them were ICE cold and the other two were hot but cold in the middle! It had been awhile since my wife and I had been to this location before and had good memories of good food and service! Doubt we will return to this place again!",

I usually get the adobada inside but you can try both, get one of each adobada and one green chili.... super super tasty!!!! The complimentary chips and dip is also bomb!! The bean dip has a tiny bit of zip to it. I have tried a few other items but I always go back to this one... really the only reason I go is because I crave this dish so much. Anything that you can get the queso fundido on will probably be awesome!",

So I have had the cheese crisp with a few extras on the side.. My parents were here and wanting some 'good ' mexican food... My mom, hated it... oops! Guess Ill pay attention to yelp before I do that again... I like that the food is New Mexican 'style' with green chile type dishes...but I have yet to be impressed with the enchiladas...or the tacos...or the food, in general. Service is blah..and inconsistent... starting from the moment you walk in to the 'dressed up' hostesses with attitude..but margs are good, strong..and the chips and salsas are good.. not great..good",

They have flat screens on the walls in the bar area and a few smaller tv's so it was a cool place to watch the game. The food was really good, we got some cheese dip and guacamole dip also a plate of carne asada tacos which was yummy. My hubby even took a carne asada burrito to go. I'm giving it 4 stars because the strawberry virgin margarita i ordered didn't really take taste that good but overall it was a cool experience.",

    "text": "This was one of the few places we found open on Christmas day and we went for dinner. Even though the place was packed and there was a line out the door, we were seated in less than 10 minutes and the service was excellent.  Having lived in New Mexico for about 5 years, I've learned a lot about green chile. I've also learned that more often than not, when you visit a restaurant serving green chile outside of New Mexico, their idea of \"hot\" is what we would call less than mild in NM. So, I was pleasantly surprised at Arriba's when I ordered a two chile dish (1 chile being mild, 2 medium and 3 hot) and got what I'd hoped for. Personally, I can't handle anything beyond medium when it comes to green chile unless I'm so sick that my taste buds are numb (which is when hot green chile is ideal). However, i was there with two people who like their chile VERY hot. One of them ordered a 3 chile dish and the waitress looked at him suspiciously (he's a pastey white guy, not one you'd peg to be able to handle spicy food) and asked if he'd ever had green chile before. He informed the waitress he was from NM at which point the waitress smiled and understood. Less than 10 minutes later my friend's eyes were watering and he had a big grin on his face. It was good stuff.  Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed by my margarita. You would think that this giant concoction (they come in those really huge margarita glasses), the entirety of which I finished, would have at least caused me to slur a word or two by the end of the night...but, alas, I didn't even get a buzz.",

I have to say I wasn't expecting much, but I love Mexican food, grew up on it, as I was born and raised in Az, and it's my favorite, so I'm always willing to eat a taco or a burrito, even a bad one.  So we start out with chips and salsa.  I have to say, I was very surprised by how spicy it was!  My daughter got the mild salsa, but mine and the bean dip put a fire in my belly that was unexpected and pleasing to my palate!    I got a red chili burrito with green sauce and rice and beans.  My daughter got a chicken burrito with red sauce and rice and beans.  Megan's food was probably a 3, chicken was ok.  But mine was divine!  The meat was in large meaty chunks, very lean and tender.  The sauce was very spicy, and the green sauce on top also was very spicy and had a great taste.   Beans tasted good and were also very spicy.  The only thing that was just ok was the rice.  I ate it, but it was just ok.  And the service was also great.  Lots of diet coke refills because of the spicy food.  I would go back to this place in a heartbeat again and again.",

Our meals were incredible!! I suggest if you can take the heat get the chili Verde. I got hot and it didn't disappoint. They can handle huge crowds, or small ones. They filled up quick for lunch. I honestly will not only go back but refer and ask to be seated in Stevie's section. She herself deserves 5 stars. I heard her talking to the table behind us, she was giving great help to the gluten free people also. She's a great asset to this business. She told us about the owner and his sad story.

The tortillas were top-notch, and the charro beans were spicy and delicious!  My wife's rio grande enchiladas, however, were disgusting.  The cheese sauce tasted like bad queso out of a can!  Really overpowering and the adobada was barely noticeable under that swamp of queso.    Go for the chili verde!  It was decent; above average.  The exterior is very warm and inviting, the staff, however, are aloof and unfriendly, except for the wait staff.  Our server was very pleasant.",

Weekday, after dinner hour rush, clean empty tables - if a restaurant is short on staff to wait on tables or to cook, perhaps have your overstaffed host desk seat people, offer drinks and chips and salsa.  Would have waited an hour with a glass of wine and your bean dip.  Bad service model, Arriba.  Shame.  Went down the street, and gave my money to a business that wanted it.",

    "text": "This is a classic American Mexican food place. It leans slightly toward New Mexico style. They have a little bar area which is sad because if the bar was bigger they would do so much more business at happy hour. The menu was extensive and not the easiest to navigate partly because it was sticky (gross). Our waiter was attentive and the place felt clean and tidy. We got two large margaritas which were very tasty and not too tangy. Food arrived in a timely manner and the food was just, average. I'm giving 3 stars because of their happy hour. Great prices and cheap decent appetizers. Secondly they are a microbrewery. This would be a hopping place if they catered less to the dining room and more to the bar. Just sayin....",

I tried a piece and it seemed as the prepared the dish and let it sit there for minute until the rest of the orders were done.   Ordered tortilla soup, liked great presentation wise but once I had of realized it was 98% tortillas that we're soggy and hardly any broth or soup in there.   It wasn't my choice to go here but the least this establishment could do is put effort into their service and efficiency and kitchen staff needs to be re educated or trained.",

It started out a bit rough, as the hostess 'forgot' to give us lunch menus and only gave us the the full priced menus.... hmmmm. We requested and received the lunch menus. The prices at lunch are decent with most plates being under 10$. The portions were also generous. I like that they give you bean dip and salsa with the chips. For lunch, I tried the New Mexican enchiladas, with a mix of green and red chili. It was fairly tasty, though a bit on the salty side. It seemed to be pretty standard Mexican fare. I would definitely consider returning at lunch time, but I felt their prices were high for dinner.",

The managers aren't even helping the poor guy and they are just walking around, and that's very alarming to me. I think one of the worst things was my boyfriend and I sat down and finished our chips and salsa, so about 15 mins before we even got a glass of water. Not to mention my boyfriend had to get up and go to the bar and order our food because we weren't getting any service. Then on top of that when he ordered a drink for us he had to go up to the bar and order it, and grab the drink himself. There was just no organization there and none of the servers even looked happy, which to me says a lot.",

    "text": "Lets begin with cleanliness, the restaurant floors and bathrooms were immaculate. Upon arriving for a late dinner on Saturday night, the place appeared empty.  We had a large party and were seated promptly with a minimum wait. The regular salsa is delicious but the spicy salsa is best. However, todays spicy salsa was a bit heavy on the garlic.  After mixing the regular salsa and the chunky salsa in a bowl I was able to get the perfect salsa .  This restaurant is New Mexico flavor style place with plenty of dishes to satisfy your pallet.  I chose the Rio Grande Enchilada plate with adobada meat which is essentially seasoned spicy shredded pork.  They come with refried beans and rice. The enchiladas are topped with a cheese sauce that is to die for... 5 stars. The dos x amber beer was spectacular and taste better in the company of good friends and family.    The only negative in the evening, was that the restaurant was under staffed and since it was late, we shared the only waitress working with the entire restaurant. This appeared to upset our waitress because they got a late rush of people and she was having a difficult time managing all the tables. But we still had an awesome family dinner experience and everyones food was great. This Arribas restaurant is probably the best of the Arribas restaurant chain. It is good for large or small groups.  I would highly recommend this place and give it 5 stars. For a family of four with a couple of beers , $63 bucks not including the gratuity. Good value and an awesome meal.",

The bad - I ordered the Santa Fe Fajita Salad which cost $12.99 (including tax).  The salad was not inedible but it certainly was not a $12 salad.  The Salad portion was what appeared to be bagged iceberg lettuce salad (the kind with carrots and red cabbage).  The meat was ok but rather bland and the guacamole was clearly turning brown.  There were hardly any peppers or onions to speak of and one large piece of onion turned out to be the thick, impossible to chew, piece of onion skin.  My food was bagged not boxed - in a bag the was puffed up with air in order to keep the bag from lying directly on the food.  Only after I started to eat my food did I realize how this might have been achieved and I tried not to imagine an employee blowing all over my food to inflate the bag. Unfortunately that thought was too much and I set the rest of my overpriced salad aside.  Also don't expect a fork or napkins in your to go order if you do decide to take your chances.  There weren't any.",

I think there was a band there that night.  In any case, I'd promised my MIL she could have a drink, so we went to Arriba.  We weren't about to eat at Arriba, but it was 7 and my daughter hadn't eaten (it was past her 6:30 bedtime).  We ordered her a grilled cheese sandwich, which came with fries.  No big surprise, but it came out on white bread.  Standard restaurant grilled cheese; nothing special.  It was $4.99 without a drink, so it wasn't a great bargain.  No matter.  My daughter took three bites and was done with it.  My MIL and I both ordered margaritas.  They were quite large.  Mine was the House margarita and hers was the Gold.  The Gold was much stronger, but I didn't feel like paying $9.99 for a margarita.  Mine was only $6.    We also ordered a hatch chile cheese crisp.  I haven't been eating dairy, but it was the holidays so I gave myself a break.  The hatch chiles were of the EXTRA spicy variety.  They were so hot that I burned my tongue.  I had to order a side of sour cream to cut the heat.  It was barely edible... even for my tastes.  I LOVE spicy hatch chiles, but these were ridiculous (and actually hotter than Los Dos Molinos - a favorite of mine)!  MIL ordered a couple enchiladas.  She is from the Midwest and her tastes are a little blander than ours here in the Southwest.  She really enjoyed them because they were covered in melted nacho cheese.    Arriba's beer prices were good.  Their drink prices were RIDICULOUS ($11.99 for a mudslide, for example).    The server was extremely helpful in taking our order.  She was also very friendly.  I never really liked Arriba in the past, but this visit was just fine.  Overall, 3 stars because the food is nothing special and the drink prices are high.",

I'm talking birthdays, celebrations, anniversaries- this was the place. But no more. For the last couple of years, service has gone downhill, and shows no sign of improving. Tonight was the final straw. Yes, it is Friday night. Yes, it was at the end of happy hour. Taking all this into consideration, it was awful. The server was clearly in a hurry, and when we werent ready to order immediately, she showed a little attitude. She did say she would be serving us with another server helping- although she was the only one that came to the table. My husband ordered a margarita, and while we were merely 15 feet from the bar, took 15 mins to get to the table-AFTER we had to remind her. That was when we next saw her. Then when our food came, it was wrong. She told me she had ordered it correctly, and I believe she did, but it came out wrong and frankly I was afraid if I sent it back, well, I wasn't sure how long that would take. That was not her fault, but after our visits over the last few years being less than desirable, we're calling it quits. Someone needs to fix the FOH, food quality is good, just poor management for quite a while now. Too bad Arriba's, we miss the way you used to be.",

    "text": "This local chain is certainly in decline, but still offers some very unique New Mexico flavors. Their many restaurants differ widely in cleanliness and service. This location in Awatukee was above average in cleanliness and the service was top notch. Our waiter handled our dietary needs and desire to get in and out very fast.  You almost can't lose with the New Mexico-style dishes (many of which are very spicy), but stay away from the \"Guacamole Dip\" appetizer. In an effort to make the dish seem bigger they pile it on top of a bed of cabbage, and toss it with tons of coarse chopped fresh tomatoes as filler. Much of the guacamole is lost in the process, and what is left is flavorless anyway.  Highly recommend the Banderra Enchiladas.",

I had ordered a margarita and the guy poured it from a pitcher, which was fine.  I told him Id pay extra to have him free hand pour me one, and he said he didn't know how :? aren't u a bartender at a mexican restaurant?? well good thing I know how to make my own margaritas, so i told him how to make it.  Then we ordered some queso as an appetizer but that never came.  The hand made margarita was really bad so i ended up drinking water.  We waited for like 45 minutes for our food, and this whole time, the server never came back to the table.  so i have two nasty margaritas in front of me and no water.  We got our food and it was cold.  I was done.  Again, I love Arribas, but this one is Shits-ville!",

We have had the White sands chimichanga, regular chimichanga, taco plate, the pollos bowl, taco salad, even tried fish tacos once (was not disappointed), green chilli burrito, and all sorts of cocktails and on tap home brewed beers.   The servers are always polite, place is always clean. Food fresh to order and comes out quick.   We have been going to Arriba's as our favorite hmm I want to eat out tonight.   Best by far that the spot is easy to get in, get a bite and get out without too much headache.   Great place for a family get together and trust us the flavors are exceptional.   I've never gotten sick from it, never get sick of the flavors they are able to stuff into their plates, all come with sides of either black, refried, pinto beans, spanish house rice and usually some salad and salsa. Request Guacamole freshly home made for an additonal charge ( it is really delicious) the margaritas and fresh chili smells bring out what is best about this location.",

I just wanted to defend or voice my opinion to these people that think themselves perfect, this is a really cool place to eat.",

Our server, Bri, was in training, with Jorge as her trainer. After being seated, we waited for about 15 minutes, without anyone coming to take our drink order. We had to find someone to come take our drink order. We ordered a second round of drinks when we ordered our food.  When our food arrived, we asked for more napkins. The napkins and our second round arrived as we were finishing our meals. Bri was moving with intention, but her trainer didn't appear to be really teaching her or appear motivated to provide good customer service. Jorge is probably not the best choice for a trainer.  Fajitas were pretty good, although not sizzling hot. One plate at our table was cold and the cheese on top wasn't even melted. Great location and venue for an awesome Mexican joint, but not gonna make it if things don't change.",

I had a craving for the Pollo con Queso so we decided to come here today for dinner. Upon receiving my dish, I noticed it was sitting in a pool of oil. I tried a bite and it only tasted like oil. I tried to pick up the oil with a few napkins and try it again but still tastes only like butter. We told the server, and he was quick to correct it with a new dish and was apologetic. The second one was barely warm but did not appear to have as much oil at first. We tried a few bits and realized the once amazing jalapeno cream cheese tasted like butter. It had no pieces of jalapeno in it and absolutely no flavor. Since the cream cheese  was mostly butter, it was melting all over the food and leaving it in a pile of butter instead of being creamy under the slices of cheese. We heard another couple behind of mentioning the same thing. We asked our server if the recipe changed, but he was unsure and mentioned someone else could have made a bad batch. I just don't understand how you make a bad batch such as this and not catch it before serving to customers. We are very disappointed.",

I spoke with management after an hour and ten minutes and magically our food came out but it was all wrong. We got chicken burrito when we ordered beef, we got trio enchiladas when we ordered combination with chicken, we got  cheese enchiladas when we ordered chicken. There was no side of sour cream. It wasn't hot at all like it supposed to be. They put tacos on the plate with enchiladas so they were all soft and soaked with the enchiladas sauce. This is the absolute worst service ever. The manger didn't seem to concerned about our wrong food orders or how long it took to get the orders out. I was a regular here and I brought my family from out of town and we received horrible service. I will never come back and I do mean never.

We sat out on the patio, it was nice. There is a water feature that made us feel relaxed.   The menu had many items on it. All of the chile dishes revolved around Hatch green chile. Being a red chile fan I was not impressed, but dh likes green so he could not decide what to order. Chips and salsa come with 3 different salsas, a mild, a hot, and a spicy bean dip. We are from New Mexico where salsa is done to our liking, with that being said I will continue on the salsas. The mild we did not even try. Looked like it had a lot of tomatoes. The hot we tried. I don't get it, why are the salsas sweet? Did not like. We finally tried the bean dip, which usually I am not a fan. This one actually had the spice going on and was not sweet! Woo hoo! We have a winner! The chips are really good. Made in house. These are light and thin, but not too thin they break in the bean dip. They are just perfect!   Food selection like I said was HUGE. When in doubt I stick to burgers. In this case I chose the green chile burger. I did not read the description on the menu just knew that I could not go wrong with a burger. Dh ordered beef adobaba. When my burger was served it had green chile in a queso sauce, and it was delicious. The Hatch green chile was tasty and not hot (remember we are from New Mexico). The queso sauce had green chile in it and made the burger a little messy to eat, but I did not complain. The burger also came with 2 patties. I saved one for my lunch the next day because it would have been too much for me, but if you like that then this will be your go to burger. Dh's beef was good. He liked the beans and even the rice which he is usually not a fan of the rice.  I thought it could have been spicier, but I really like HOT RED CHILE. We split a sopapilla which are served as a dessert here. At home they could be used either way, and I usually ate it with my food. The sopa was good.  This place, which is why dh was there, makes their own beer! Now they don't have an IPA, but what they did have was good. Dh ordered the Bock. He normally doesn't order Bock but since they didn't have IPA, it was the next go to. He liked this one. He was amazed at the brewing. He now says he may try out their amber since the bock had good flavor.  Our waitress was very attentive. I never had to ask for a refill of water. It was not busy when we showed up or as we ate. The only negative thing was because we were eating outside a person sitting at the outside bar was smoking. Luckily it was when we were ready to  call it a night anyway, but wow that was stinky!   We may be back again and I will post if I choose something different next time.",

Took another 10 minutes before our server bothered to come over and greet us. About 20 minutes later she finally took our food orders. And this was a quiet night, weren't many other customers, but they were slow as molasses syrup in the winter.  The after I got home was checking my credit card account and found out they double charged me. Sorry Arriba, you won't be getting my business again. And your margaritas are very subpar",

Ordered drinks first after about 10 minutes the sodas came we had also ordered waters.  Then about 15 minutes later we get the 2 beers we ordered still no water. Then about 5 minute later we finally get our water and at that time we order our food.  One member got a macha chiminchonga  he says he has no desire to got back ever again.  We were on the patio and toward the end of the night we were the only ones out there we asked to have the cooler turned off as our food was getting cold. We requested the cooler be turned off to 3 different employees non of them seem to have a clue what we were talking about.  Overall not worth the price and terrible service.  We were told the kitchen was backed up but why did drinks take so long? They dont get made in the kitchen.",

A lot of people can't handle the heat from the hatch so they tend to diss like the food. If you can handle the heat I highly recommend these dishes.  Carlsbad Stuffed Chicken Breast - Chicken breast stuffed with vegetables, cream cheese, and topped with queso fundido Served with rice and choice of beans. This dish is really hot at times Hatch Chicken Especial - Chicken guisado with diced green Hatch chiles, jalapeno cream cheese, and green sauce covered with shredded cheese. Served in a boat with fresh tortillas, rice, and beans. Another great pick would be the White Sands Chimichanga - A chimichanga filled with spicy pork green chile and covered with our tasty queso fundido. Served with Mexican rice and your choice of beans. If you enjoy spicy food cooked with hatch chiles you will enjoy Arrib Mexican grill.",

All in all its not bad. Probably real good for big events as there is room a plenty.  Just to compare it is WAY way better then Abuelo's Mexican Food Embassy, which easily ranks my own list of WORST Mexican Food places.",

TACO TUESDAY & CHIMI THURSDAY   I heard of Arribas but I've never been until I started working on this side of town. I'm very much loyal to Poncho's. What can I say? So Taco Tuesday is $0.99 a Taco, pretty popular. And $1.99 Chimi on Thursday, sort of popular. However, Tuesdays and Thursdays are usually packed for lunch but if you know what your ordering it's much faster. Service may not be at it's best on these days but you will get your food. (If you get the right waiter and server.)  The chips and salsa (Hot,Mild) and hot bean dip are very addicting, so watch the intake or you'll be taking a doggy bag home.

    "text": "I am very mixed on this place. In some instances, I have had some great food and others, not so much. Here are some of the good instances:  -Queso Fundido dip is pretty tasty and taken above the typical velveeta dip that alot of restaurants offer -Arriba Taco Salad with shredded beef is actually  good and has a lot of veggies in it. I love the jalapeno ranch that comes with it. Its a pretty massive salad too! One of the less spicy items on their menu as well if you are not into spice -Mexican Pizza with shredded beef - Not bad but definitely not enough guac on it. Either order with extra guac or sour cream, or do as I did and order the queso fundido dip and dip the pizza in it  :O White Sands Chimi - Pretty good actually but extremely spicy for my taste. The husband loves this! -Flautas plate - Not too bad and definitely not spicy. They tend to give you lots of guac with this  :) -Chips, salsa, and bean dip - The chips, salsa and bean dip are decent. The only thing I would suggest is adding onion to the bean dip but then again, I am a total onion lover! The more onions, the better! -Arriba red sauce - This sauce has a good flavor. I like to get a side of it and pour it on my rice -Fried Ice cream with strawberries - By far my favorite item at Arriba!!! Everything else listed above has been good/ ok but nothing I would say is great. However, this fried ice cream is great! I LOVES IT and it might just be the best fried ice cream evar!  Here are the bad instances: -Chili Poblano - Too spicy to where you can't even tell what your tasting. I ordered this the first time I came and was not a happy camper. Don't let the one chili on the menu fool you, it should have 3! Granted, I am a wimp when it comes to spice but I can actually handle spice if there is a good flavor. This was just knock your eyes out of their sockets spicy and my stomach felt like crap afterward -Arriba sampler plate - Everything tasted crappy and old. Tamale was very dry -Shredded Beef tacos - Flavor of the meat is blah and the taco shell always seems to be soggy when I have ordered these. I love tacos but not these ones!  Now about the service, almost every time I have been here, the service is not very good especially when it comes getting more water. For a place that claims to be spicy, you would think they would automatically be bringing you water but they don't, you have to ask for it. Then apparently, you have to ask for refills because they never come back to refill it. I always dread that when I go to Arriba. They claim that they don't bring you water because of the current drought situation, however, look outside. There is a giant water debacle that runs morning, noon, and night! WTF?   I will say that they have a decent menu with many options and I love that there are pictures so you can see what everything will look like. That is the only reason I came back again after my first experience which was not pleasant. To sum it up, this place is simply ok in my book (except where fried ice cream is concerned, they make a glorious one!). However, you cant make a meal out of a fried ice cream. This is never one of the places that pops into my head to go to unless I want a sugar fix but I come here often since the hub likes it.",

It doesn't really even seem like the food is made in a New Mexican style of preparation.  It's more like New Mexican as seen through a Sonoran filter.  I mean no disrespect to Sonoran style Mexican food, it's tasty as well.  But the green chile sauce I've had smothered over, and within, various dishes at my fave NM spots has a lot more green chile in it and is NOT merely a greenish gravy with green onions and pork (or beef).  The essence of the sauce should be green chile and not over compensated, or embellished with too many spices otherwise.    Thus, the meal I had at Arriba was lackluster.  I had huevos rancheros.  The potatoes were warm and stale as if they'd been sitting for a spell.  The refried beans could have been canned and I wouldn't have known the difference.  Even the  cheese was bland.  I've been here twice expecting to be knocked off my seat with a NM/green chile flavor explosion.  No dice, chino.  Aside from the cheesy name, if you'd like a step above this substandard NM fare, try Si Senor in Chandler.  They're pretty solid.  And if you want fire, there is always Los Dos Molinos.  Arriba, you need work.",

Now before I continue, when I dislike a place with the amount of hatred that I have for an awful place like arribas, there is a good reason. I will never base my opinion off of one meal, I will give a place multiple chances before I write it off completely.  The food is absolutely disgusting, either too salty or not flavorful at all, I can not stand a single thing at this place. Just thinking about it makes me wonder how this place stays in business. Nachos..nasty Enchiladas..nasty Rice...nasty Flautas...NASTY! I could go on forever!  How a restaurant can screw up a big bowl margarita is beyond me..but somehow..this place can do it! Don't go here, recommend this place only to your worst enemy. EW!",

They basically sat us in the isle to the bathrooms and kitchen.  The poor waiters kept bumping into our chairs to get past us. And the people seated in the booths on the other side of us had to wait for us to stand up so they could get out since it was so tight.  I asked for a drink menu and was told they were revamping it and there wasn't one available, so asked a couple of questions and ordered something.  Didn't receive what I ordered but our waiter was new so figured oh well.  He was also very slow in getting back to us so I got tired of waiting.  Got the bill and the drink was $9.  For a drink...that wasn't what I ordered and had not been told a price on.  Yes, I should have asked. Learn the hard way I guess.  99 cent Margarita would have been better. Service was very slow, food was mediocre at best. Prices seemed very high for the quality of food. Staff was friendly thank goodness.",

I've also gotten some party platters for family events and they did a great job. My only complaint is that sometimes the waiters forget about you and when ordering catering or food to go it takes longer than when you scheduled to pick it up so I'd recommend  asking for an earlier time like 30 minutes so you will get your food when you actually want / need it or just show up 30 minutes early to let them know you're waiting... you may have to remind them a couple times.",

The atmosphere is very nice, the prices are reasonable and the food is very good.  Today was \"Chimichanga Thursday\" so I got a Chicken Chimichanga for only $1.99!  I asked the waiter how much it would be to add in rice and beans (if I'd seen how big it was I would have seen I didn't need anything else) and he told me $3.  I said, for both? And he said yes.  I'm sorry, but I believe the waiter should know how much the food costs and when I got the bill it said I was charged $1.99 each for the side dishes.  I didn't complain but I did knock a dollar off my usual 20% tip.  If he had told me it was the right price I wouldn't have done that.  He was nice enough, but I got charged $2.39 for one cup of coffee and he never did come around to see if I wanted a refill--nor did he refill our water either.  I mean, this is ARIZONA,  you should refill people's water in a restaurant.  No brainer.  You would think.  I would still come back here, just be more aware and assertive.   (4/16/09)",

Luckily, every time we order for take out the food has been very good. The chips and salsa are always fresh. My husband likes the chicken chimi platter and we had try the carne adobada pizza, plate and sampler platter. I like the way they seasoned the food, not too salty and you can taste the spices. Leftovers taste better (though maybe mushy) the next day.  So, service and food at the restaurant will be a 2, but since I always have a great take out experience, I'll give them 4 stars",

I had a huge plate of food but it was mostly consisted of lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, ect. There was hardly anything else, not that I would've eaten it anyways. So I we decided to order deep fried ice cream and disappointment hit again. It was ice vanilla ice cream with corn flakes sprinkled on the top. Unbelievable!

The fajitas were overcooked and under-seasoned and my wife's food tasted really bad. It just seemed like the quality of the ingredients used in the food was poor.

One of us always gets \"the bad plate of food\". Not here. We got there at happy hour, 99 cent margaritas. Heck yeah. Hubby ordered Hatch Chile Cheese Crisp, that could have feed all of us, end of story. It was delicious, the green chili had such a great taste not bitter at all and just the right amount of heat.   Here is the dinner line up... Hatch Chile Relleno. Awesome taste, not very spicy though.    Bandera Enchiladas. OMG Fantastic. Enchilada with red, green and  spicy queso fundido. The chicken was seasoned well, I could have just eaten that but what fun would that be.    Flaming Arriba Fajitas. Delicious! It was nice to get fajitas and not have it mainly grilled onions. This had a good portion of steak and grilled onions and green bell peppers. The tortillas were nice and fluffy. Came with the fixing of  guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo. Their guac is...yummy!  All 3 dinners came with beans and rice which I could have made a meal of. The dinners were huge and could easily be shared.  Lastly service. our waitress was very nice. She was exactly how I like to be waited on, answered questions about the food, took our order, brought drinks, food, checked if everything was good, cleared plates BEFORE bringing the bill, didn't hover around which I find annoying. I wish I could remember her name because she really did a nice job.  We will definitely be back.",

Their booth was too small for a plus size woman, and the seat was terribly uncomfortable.  While I was at the booth I had one waiter and once  I moved he tried to come with me to that table but then came another waiter! They were confused on who was taking care of me so they both were bringing me things! But they finally got that straightened out! Chris was my waiter and he was very attentive, super sweet kid, and he did a great job even though he charged me for a drink I didn't order but, he quickly fixed the problem! So I was pleased with his service!  Also the hostess was extremely kind and had great customer service.   The food was really good!  The restaurant brings chips and salsa to your table but they also bring a bean dip which was a little bland by its self but was really good with the queso!  As for my order I only had the Queso Fondido which was really tasty! And the presentation was nice! They light it on fire before serving it.  The order of queso was too large for just one person and I'm not big on wasting food, so with the queso, bean dip and salsa with chips, that was more than enough food for me! However, I did order a frozen Margarita and it was Amazing!  The menu had pictures, which I liked!  I'm very visual.  The restaurant itself was clean, and decorated with a lot of bright colors. A very comfortable, casual vibe!  The only reason I didn't give it high stars is because they could use a little update, the food was good but not amazing, (but to be fair, I didn't try an entree)  and the service was good but a little chaotic!  But a good place for lunch!",

The skillets were \"lit\" on fire at the table.  The food was still cold including lukewarm refried beans.  There was hardly a full chicken breast between the two orders... think 5 pieces/bites of chicken and maybe 5 bites of steak. The veggies consisted of all onions with maybe 2-3 slices of pepper. All cold/lukewarm. Upon mentioning it to the waitress her response was \"ok what do you want me to do about it?\" I suggested getting a manager.   The manager's solution was to order extra meat and veggies AND BILL us for it (we found that part out later). After waiting to receive the extra for 10-15 minutes we told the manager to nevermind. The waitress later \"graciously\" pointed out how they took the \"extra\" charges off. Um how about the rest of the meal or a discount? Bad food. Bad service... luckily my husband found a meal replacement shake at a store nearby.",

It took our waiter along time to acknowledge my husband and I were waiting to get our drink and appetizer order taken. Once we got our order for drinks and appetizer taken our drinks came out first and then fifteen minutes later got a subpar cheese crisp that was cold when it got to our table and the tortilla was over baked, flaky, and dehydrated . The food we ordered came out ten minutes after our appetizer did there for we couldn't even enjoy our appetizer without filling ourselves up and not being able to enjoy our meal. My plate looked as if someone ordered it sent it back and I got their order and I could've broken a tooth for how hard some of my rice was cooked. My husbands plate looked fresh an 10x's better presentation wise compared to mine. Please tell your cooks that the first thing a customer eats with is their eyes. Also our waiter NEVER offered my husband or I a refill on our drink. After asking if we wanted a box and our final check we said yes and ten minutes later he walked back to our table asked the same question and then left to get the check. I get it's one thing busy when you are the only waiter the service AND food were disappointing,   Respectfully submitted",

Ok that's fine. When she took our orders she had no personality or not even a smile. Ordered a cheese crisp to start. She dropped it off and said \"Here you go\" and walked off. As I was eating my meal I could hear how the table behind us had her meal wrong but she ate it and was happy with it. Our server then gave her the wrong the bill. Maybe she worked a double and was tired but it wasn't the most pleasant dining experience. Just kind of seemed like we were a bother to her and she didn't want to be there. We were planning to get dessert but we ended up just paying and getting out of there.  Is it me or should your server be pleasant?  \"Hello my name is ______, I'll be your server tonight. May I start you off with a couple of drinks or appetizers as you look over the menu?\" Not just \"What do you want to drink?\"",

What I received was nothing but a giant pile of grilled onions. I shit you not. Our server actually brought this to me. No green pepper, no tomato, no nothing. Just onion. WTF.

I work in the industry and the way you keep people coming back as return customers is CUSTOMER SERVICE! When we walked in and waited to be seated....was not greeted....one cashier was busy with a customer but the other two standing there did not acknowledge us at all! Another two customers walked in and they were greeted only because one was an employee and was offered menus! Even after walking up to the cashier she still did not acknowledge us! We then turned around and left! Needles so say you lost business because some of your staff needs CUSTOMER SERVICE 101!",

I thought they had a good level of spice to them (the red sauce), and the portions were really generous. I was also a really big fan of the bean salsa they had as well; tbh I'm just here for the free chips & salsa   Now, the service was... pretty okay. They messed up one of our friends order. She asked for the burrito with green sauce instead of red and it came out with the spicier sauce and she couldn't eat it. We asked for a new order and the waiter happily brought out a new order to go.   Nothing super out of the ordinary, but I felt as though the food was pretty bomb! It seems like they have pretty good deals on drinks as well for happy hour  Edit: I also wanted to mention the service super slow for not having a lot of people in the restaurant. It was a 20 min wait and when we got seated there was literally no one in the place",

    "text": "Phoenix is loaded with Mexican restaurants all of which put their own spin on homemade signature dishes. Arriba makes a decent attempt at serving classic plates. I'm a chips and salsa fan. Not only do you get the salsa, but you get a dish of beans for dipping. There are a lot of lunch specials from soup to taco salad to seafood. My typical choice is the enchiladas served rice and beans and smothered in your choice of red or green sauce. The chicken is moist with a good balance of spices. Service met my expectations. I was impressed to learn they have their own hatch chile farm and source them as a staple ingredient. You will find them roasting them outside from time to time. It's quite a show!  The atmosphere is bright and colorful with fountains near the front door, misters for the hot summer sun, and a huge patio open from the dining room. My preference would be to eat at a more authentic place before choosing Arriba. But when in the neighborhood and I'm craving it I will drop-in.",

The service is hit or miss at best but the food is consistent so we come back. Tonight was a DISASTER. The manager (bless his heart) delivered the wrong food to our table twice before we even got our drinks. Ahhh the drinks, I went to the bar to get them myself as our server walked past them 3 times. Our $9.99 Cabo margs were delicious but I fished out 2 fruit flies (see trashed pic). My order was incorrect (I asked for beans to sub out rice, didn't happen, and ordered a side of guacamole and sour cream which you guessed it, didn't happen). My husbands flautas were burned. They tried to cover it up with toppings (um ok). Our second round of drinks took 20 minutes after our server said she would make sure it came it quicker. I was sitting near the bar and I could see the tickets...it wasn't the bartender, the order was never sent. So we finally get the beans, guacamole, sour cream and new flautas but we were over it (get me boxes please) The manger (bless his brave heart)!came to our table. My husband said it was a tough night, and he agreed.  I said it was unfortunate and told him he might want to check the bar for fruit flies and handed him the napkin in put the flies on. He was apologetic and we never saw him again. The server dropped the bill, I gave her my card (no comp/adjustment, not that we \"needed\" one but MIGHT have been a nice gesture) and she dropped the payment without my card...\"Oh, can I have my card back?\" I still gave her over a 15% tip bc I don't want bad karma and typically these problems are due to lack of training (management problem and lack of forecasting and staffing..again management prob). If the server was empathetic at all I would have given 20% + If she applied any effort. What a crap show. I'll drive to San tan to avoid this location.",

I ordered a beef enchilada and my husband ordered a beef burrito.  Both of our meals were bland and flavorless which is hard to do with Mexican food.  We both had red sauce that was also flavorless.  All in all a hugely disappointing meal.  As I looked around the entire restaurant needs a makeover as nothing has changed since it was opened close to 2006.  I don't know a home that can go that long without changing and updating.  I am amazed they have been able to stay opened in this community which usually demands higher quality.",

This has happened before where they've forgotten our sides, salsa for our chips and forgot sides of tortillas for dishes that come with it. It's small things but very significant. It inconvients us as customers when we have to wait for things to be done when we're there to pick up. The point for ordering over the phone to pick up is so we don't have to wait. We want to come and go and enjoy our food at home. Other than Arriba's take-out service, they are a great place to dine. Great food and margaritas!",

I spent $23 and got two big lunches and four delicious margaritas. They have a nice patio with cool murals and a big waterfall. The inside is also nice with a big bar area. I had the green chile burrito and my husband had the Rio Grande enchilada. Both were good and had some spice! It's nice to see a southwestern restaurant that isn't afraid to use a little heat. I'll definitely go back. I just hope I can find someone to drive me because those margaritas are too good to pass up.",

My boyfriend and I decided to visit the Arriba's on Chandler blvd. The hostess was less than welcoming but we did get to sit right away.  The server seemed to be displeased to be at work and was very short with us.  I unknowingly put my hand in a cooked onion/pepper that was left in the booth, so clearly it wasn't wiped down between guests.  Our server forgot our appetizer, but I mean, things happen and I would let that slide anyways, since the chips and salsa are always delicious anyways.  Our drinks and water came out right with the food.  I ordered vegetarian fajitas and got a skillet full of onions and I think 3 green peppers.  My boyfriend and I vowed to never go to that location again.",

    "text": "Service and ambiance were typical for a friendly, mainstream Mexican / American restaurant.  No complaints there.  Our server was quick with refills and made sure we were taken care of.  The restaurant itself was festively decorated and clean.  The food, however, was below par when compared to similar competition, being On the Border, Serrano's or Macayo's.  And we felt that pretty much across the menu they were also $1-$2 more per item.  But the big kicker....There just wasn't any flavor!  The food came quickly, as it usually seems to do in this style of dining establishment.  My wife and I ordered the \"Holiday Special\" burrito, made with beef and two kinds of chili sauce.  I made it through two bites and was so unimpressed I just stopped eating.  I also added an a la carte beef taco to my burrito...at a cost of $4.99.  There was no flavor coming from that shredded beef that would've given me a hint I was eating southwestern food.  I don't expect much from a $5 kids meal, so I'll give that those were okay, Kraft mac and cheese for one and a burger and fries for the other.  I'm not going to write Arriba's off our future nights out.  Maybe we just got a bad batch of coming out from the kitchen that night.  Maybe we ordered the wrong thing and should have asked for a recommendation.  In any case we'll give them another shot.",

If you're ordering for dinner, most of their items are a tad pricy in my opinion, but not to the ridiculous end. Their margaritas are HUGE and delicious (especially if you splurge for the Cabo wabo one) and their bean dip is to die for! I definitely recommend this place and if you're going to get something enchilada style, go with the green sauce!",

The Good: They actually have a pretty decent breakfast on the weekends; and you get a side of pancakes with breakfast too! The Queso dip is a tasty appetizer (it has chorrizo in it, mmm!). And the $.99 Happy Hour Margaritas are reason enough to visit Arriba.  The Not-So-Good: The service is pretty spotty. Sometimes you're waiting a while and the restaurant isn't even crowded. And I wouldn't say they're the friendliest group of people either -- not rude, but not friendly. The food is sort of uneven as well: some winners and some duds. And pay attention to the heat levels on the menu; some of the dishes are HOT.  Overall, Arriba is a decent middle-of-the-road Mexican dining option. I'll undoubtedly be back...for sure during Happy Hour.",

The place was dead - it seems they have a lot of happy hour & drink specials and thats what they cater to. As for the food - skip it unless your happy with just chips and salsa.

Over the past few months, me and my family have been coming here every once in a while for happy meal- cheap margaritas for the over-21 (not me) and half-off apps (what we normally get). Today, I went with my mother, sister, aunt, two cousins, grandma, and four friends. Despite only having six of the eleven to start off with, we went to the table pretty quickly. The server was friendly, and checked up every couple minutes (probably to just get some orders in) while we were waiting for the other guests. She was quick with the waters, and after the others came in, was fairly consistent with her service. The only complaint I had was she didn't ask about refilling my soda when it was getting close to empty.  Like we normally do, we tried to order completely off the appetizer section, since it was half off. Me, my mom, and my grandma split the taquitos, chicken mini chimis, and hatch chili quesadilla. The taquitos and chimis were slightly underseasoned, but were quite tasty in the dipping sauce the taquitos came with. The hatch chili quesadilla was really good! It was spicy, just how I like it; however, you could tell it had been microwaved, which slightly disappointed me.  The food was probably three out of five, and the service probably four, which is why I chose this rating.",

When one person complained about it they were immediately seated at another open booth.  Being the chump that I am and having a party of 6 we waiting patiently.  I ran over to CVS to get a snack for the wait.  We were finally seated new an area that was closed off and near several empty and set tables while others waiting to be seated.  Our server only had 2-3 tables but was gone from the floor for long stretches.  It took over 10 min to get our drinks (probably more like 15).    The food took at least 45min (although the guacamole came out fairly quickly).  I had the chicken breast plate.  The chicken was nicely seasons, the rice was ok, the bean portion was very small.  My wife's fajitas were good but the veggies were incinerated.  the kids enjoyed their tacos, salsa, bean dip and guac.  I tried a couple of the house beers but they didn't impress me.  My wife had a 99c margarita and liked it.    While my wife was using the bathroom a waitress came in crying.  I can only guess that the kitchen was understaffed so they held people back to keep from flooding it.  The food was decent and there are other things on the menu I would like to try, so we may be back again, but not at Christmas.",

Granted, the beer was only $2, but we'd rather pay $1-$2 more for a better beer at other HH spots.  The bar itself looked a bit grimy which deterred us from ordering any food.

    "text": "About 38 years ago I discovered Mexican Restaurants with their food served on hot plates. Ask yourself this question-Of all the restaurants you dine in, which serves its hot food on hot plates? We serve home cooked meals on hot plates as a bar was set by Mexican Restaurants.  We've been dining in Arriba Meican Grill for years. Is it True Mexican food? It's more like Americanized Mexican Food which is ok with me. On November 28, 2012, we had lunch here as we were nearby. Service is always great! Seated right away with chips/salsa served along with our drinks. The serves watch you drink levle as refills appear without request.  For this visit, we orderd a lunch size Guacamole, lunch size spinach Enc/Flauta and a lunch size shredded beef Burrtio plate. By rhe time we were done with our chips.our meals arrived on the hot plates that keeps the meal warm until you're finished.  Food and service has always been great during our experiences here. We highly recommend this location!",

I only expected to get one kids meal free, but when my daughter (age 6) didn't like her meal (mac n cheese) and sent it back, I did not expect that to count as the free kids meal. Shockingly, the waitress told me she gave me my daughter's meal for free and when I asked about the kids eat free, she said the free meal was my daughters - the one that was sent back uneaten!!!   Horrible customer service. Horrible food.",

This past weekend not only was the food delicious, but additionally the service we received exceeded outstanding.  My mother had bought us a 40$ gift card for a date night out, and upon arriving to the restaurant we asked the waitress to check the amount of money that was on the gift card. After checking she returned telling us that the card had never been loaded, and was thus empty. I called my mother to see if she still had her receipt, which she did. She proceeded to call the restaurant and talk to the new general manager, Dan, who was kind and generous to all of her inquiries. He recognized that a mistake had been made and comped our entire meal, as well as giving us the number of the card that was supposed to have to original 40$ on it.   The food was spectacular as always, and will Dan's intervention the meal was a complete success, I cannnot wait to return to this location as I'm sure we will have an amazing time.",

The amount of fish was ridiculous for the price of the meal ($11), I wish I had taken a photo of it.  It wasn't seasoned and had no taste.  Oh, and the ice tea was nasty.

    "text": "Alright, mind you this is a second review to my first one 3 years ago. We love Arribas and their food tastes great, and still does. I gave Arribas 4 stars last time, but this time they're lucky to get 2. I'd give the food 5, but the service 0.   Sorry, but not sorry to 'Miguel' our server, but you really need to be retrained on your serving etiquette...  Fri night, got sat, waited almost 20min to get greeted. Then 'Miguel' came up after almost 20min, took our drink order. We tried to give him our full order and he said, 'sorry I can't take your order, I'm not your server.' Then he comes back a little later with waters, chips and salsa and says 'well I guess I am your server'. (Oh and after he greeted us the first time, we saw him turn to a manager talking to her and obviously upset because he thought he was cut or was about to be cut, yet he wasn't and we were his last table.)  So he takes our order, (oh yea we have an 18month old and it's already hard enough dealing with all of this too because it's taken so long). As he takes our order we tell him what we want for our son, he says 'do you want the guac and sour cream with his meal?' Implying that it comes with it. Nope it didn't come with it, we got charged 2.29 and 1.99 for both sides with the kids meal, which were almost the same price as the kids me itself.   Food came out quick, tastes great, yet by then we had been there for almost 45min, our son was well over impatient and ready to go, my wife and I couldn't enjoy our dinner, decided to box up our food and ask for the check to leave without any longer delay... Yet we had to wait for 'Miguel' because he was busy complaining to the busser about the mess his other table left(no pre bussing), looking at his tips and cash left right in front of us from other tables, paying no attention to us.. We had all of our plates stacked and ready for him to grab and all we wanted was boxes and the check. Yet we had to wait until it was convenient for him to come over to us.  Now like I said, we've been to Arribas before, we love the food, always appreciate the service even if it's busy and it takes a little long(it's been worth it). Although when we get neglected, undermined, and screwed into a bad experience/paying for what we didn't order, we really don't appreciate it. MIGUEL was unprofessional, deceiving, and neglectful. Regardless of us being his last table or upset he wasn't cut yet doesn't give him the right to ruin our night. We would've preferred he transferred us to a more appreciative server.  I guess this must be our fault for coming to Arribas on a Friday night at this time, maybe if we waited a little longer until Miguel was officially cut then we would've gotten a better server, or we should've just sat at the bar?  I'm a server myself, been one for 8 years, I know how it is, I understand how it is if it's slow, you think you're going to get cut, or you think you are yet you aren't, it doesn't matter. Transfer the table if you really want to, or have to leave. Your table is your table. Don't take your crappy night out on someone else, not cool.  Oh and don't count/look at your tips (and make reactions) 2 feet away from your other active tables, cmon man!  Who knows when we plan on coming back to Arribas, maybe we'll just get it take out next time to avoid the hassle.",

My chimichanga was covered in a white cheese that tasted like velveta (gross) and the tortilla was quite tough.  My wife's carnitas were good but were $16.00 which I find to be too high.  The one good thing were the server and manager.  Both were very friendly and attentive.  My wife had a question about the cream cheese they used and the manager found out and told us.  So kudos for that.  All in all I was unimpressed and would not bring my business here when there are so many better options in my opinion.",

I moved and came back last night and took my wife, two daughters, and four grand kids there for dinner.  Everything was going fine, great waitress.  Then the manager snuck over to my table to tell me that someone complained that we were too loud.  The restaurant was all but empty in the dining area.  The kids were incredibly well behaved.  My one year old grand son was being a 1 year old but was no where near being disruptive.  The manager for all intensive purposes asked us to leave.  My daughter apologized which made me furious because she nor we had done anything wrong.  All of the wait staff were flabbergasted that we were treated that way and knew he was out of line.  They said there were other children throughout the night that were far more loud and rambunctious even running around the restaurant and they were not approached my management.  I will never ever go back there and will never recommend it to anyone.  I've never been treated that way in my life.  It's a FAMILY restaurant.  But I guess to their management and some patrons it's not.",

I am giving Arribas one star because of how poorly and unprofessionally I was dealt with. This is a public health issue and Shawn tried to brush it off. We've been visiting Arribas for years since their first location opened on Camelback Rd in Phoenix. We will not be back because of getting sick and because of how our concerns were responded to.",

One of them sat my family (my husband and our 4 year old son) at a table and then we never heard from anybody again. 15 minutes and not one person came to our table despite a couple (literally only two) servers looking our way and then walking away. We decided it wasn't worth it anymore and left. On our way out, we saw the manager up front with the hostesses and he didn't seem like he was doing much. Funny that he was up front with nobody to seat and not walking around in an almost empty restaurant to make sure that the tables that were there were being taken care of.   The hostesses and the manager said, \"Thanks for coming in!\" without looking up at as. I glanced at all of them with a confused look and finally the girl that sat us looked right at me with an expression that said, \"Wait. I sat them just 15 minutes ago...???\"    They need to get a better system going. Maybe have the hostess TELL the servers that they have people seated. Or maybe have the manager manage it all. Either way, I don't know what the food tastes like because we never got there.",

Not so special at $7.99 but it seems now a days that is the way it goes.  I must say the fish (probably frozen) tasted fresh and grilled perfectly well.  It was large with two soft tortillas surrounding it.  Nice Baja sauce and lettuce, onions, and a tad of tomatoes.  Really pretty tasty.  I am a chip person and theirs was thin, crunchy and warm. Very nice.  .  I like the warm bean dip.  The regular salsa was a bit sharp and just so so.  The young lady who served us was sweet and attentive.

It was a Thursday night after happy hour and there were approximately 7-9 other table occupied. No big groups, no reason it should be so slow. And it wasn't the food that took a while. It was drink refills, and chips, and the check.  The food was mediocre at best. The bean dip was served cold and was really really thick. As if it had been out for a while and reheated again and again.  We ordered a cheese crisp with Hatch chiles on it. It came with our entree and without the chiles.  Half to 3/4 of it was burnt.  We asked for chiles, she took it away and brought it back within 5 minutes with a few cold (looked like straight from the can) chiles in clumps on it. (At least it was fast!) My husband's carnitas was about 1/2 - 3/4 cup of pork spread across chopped red cabbage.  He couldn't eat the pork without the cabbage stuck to it and couldn't get all the pork out of the cabbage.  So, we won't be back. I remember why we stopped going.",

    "text": "If this New Mexico style restaurant was in New Mexico, it would not be open.Although it is not the worst place for Mexican food, it is easy to see why this is one of few places you dont have to wait for a table on busy nights.  Tonight our service was decent and the food was ok, just as expected. The hot salsa is way better than the mild and the bean dip is tasty with a spicy kick. I ordered the NM style red which was tasty but had no heat to it. I regret ordering the Margarita because it was too sweet and had zero tequila flavor. I can't stand when you pay for a Margarita and get triple sec over ice.  The total for five (3 kids and 2 adults) was $67 (not including tip) for the meal, 2 beers and a no tequila margarita. Our money could have probably been spent better elsewhere. The best part of the meal was not waiting for a table.",

Most places close up by 10 or so - I managed to walk into Arriba for a last call and ordered a frozen margarita.  As late as I was, there was no rushing to get me out and the staff was great about bringing chips and salsa too. The margarita was OK - had better, had worse. Hope to stop in again there to check out the food.",

    "text": "i had a big craving for Arriba's, so we went last night. It was a big mistake. The service was downright poor taking 22 full minutes before being even acknowledged. Chips and salsa took even longer to arrive, but i forgot to look at my phone to see how much longer. No water was offered, so we had a full bowl of chips and salsa with NO drinks at all. Finally the harried waitress arrived to take our order. Mind you, it was NOT super busy at dinner time. We got our drinks finally, and then about midway thru we had refills without really wanting them as if to make up for the slow service. Food was ok. Service was very slow. Checkout was so slow that i almost walked up to the front desk to pay. Good thing the harried waitress arrived when she did. Overall, i felt like i wasted my evening. Oh, one more thing. They really should offer a drink menu as it is a mexican restaurant, and there are various types of tequila. Some people really are particular about their tequilas, and there are literally NO PRICES, no margarita menus, none at all. Literally the weirdest thing ever. I did not order a margarita last night, but i did last week when we were here, and the waitress had to go back and check if they had certain types and what the cost were. You're in the dark with what they have and pricing.",

However Half way thru my burrito was a HUGE CHUNK OF CARNITAS aka shredded pork I couldn't tell if they were being assholes or they are just too fucking stupid to make a burrito without dead animal Caracas in it. It really pissed me off and I am never going back!  On a good note the guacamole and chips and salsas were fantastic. Our waiter was very friendly as well. The bill was cheap for the amount of food we ordered.   Vegetarians beware. Meat eaters: you're gonna enjoy arribas!",
