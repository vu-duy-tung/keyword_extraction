    "text": "We ordered Hachi Special Ramen, Spicy Ramen and Takoyaki. The Hachi Special was fairly good but we preferred the traditional yellow ramen noodle than the white one. The broth was a little too over powering with bamboo shoots flavor. The spicy ramen was good but the broth was too salty. If it was less salty, then it will taste perfect and will be better than the broth flavor for Hachi special. The Takoyaki is not good and is worth 2.5 stars. It barely contained any squids in the filling. The fillings was too doughy. One of the worse Takoyaki that I had so far.  Overall, the noodles that we had is a 4 stars.",

The ramen arrived to our table hot straight from the kitchen which is a plus for me. The broth has a lot of flavor and full of generous toppings. There are options for extra but we didn't feel the need to do any add-ins. The chicken karage is juicy and tender on the inside full of good flavor and the outside is crunchy and just right in the breading. Our son opted for the karage and fried rice both of which were bigger than ours!  The fried rice was done very well with a good wok flavor and a fair amount of vegetables and meat. We will be back soon for our ramen fix!",

Spent nearly 7 days in Japan recently and this was the most consistent with what you get there out of all the Phoenix places. Ingredients tasted fresh. Service was quick and not intrusive. They had Japanese drinks like calpis water and draught Japanese beers. Wish there was one in Scottsdale, the ones in Scottsdale are too Americanized. Prices are reasonable. Will obviously be back.",

The octopus balls (kind of like macaroni balls) were delicious! I've tried octopus before and the texture does make me a bit hesitant, but theirs is so not slimy or grainy in texture. Just delicious savory dough balls. They were harmonized in flavors of savory and a sweet sauce drizzled on top. For the main course I got their ramen. Loved the broth and thicker ramen noodles!! It tasted even better with their signature side of hot sauce.   Drinks: They had a variety of drinks on their menu from ramune, sodas, and melon and mango Creme sodas. I got the mango Creme soda and indulged in a sweet drink.   I would deff come back for the octopus balls and ramen!",

The depth and richness of the broth is representative of the hours and hours of cooking down meat and bones, and the clean flavor is augmented by a good amount of delicious fat, enough so that your lips will smack with gelatinous goodness while you are slurping down the whole bowl.  The egg complements the dish by adding another texture of creamy deliciousness. The char-siu pork could have been a little more tender, but I have no other complaints about this dish.  The karage chicken was just okay, as it could have used maybe a minute or two more of frying and a little bit of salt and/or lemon to brighten up the flavor.    The owner asked us how the food tasted, and he told us that he opened up this restaurant after he recently came back from Japan, where he learned how to master the ramen cooking process.  I believe that the final product that he is serving reflects the time spent overseas, and I selfishly hope that enough customers will fill up his restaurant on a daily basis so that his business can succeed and that I may always be able to enjoy the best ramen in town.",

    "text": "Good new ramen shop in Chandler. Came with one of the expats from Japan and we both liked it here.  Was here a week after grand opening and by then things got settled well and I enjoyed my lunch here. They still don't have a few things on the menu yet (gyoza or miso ramen).  I ordered karaage combination ramen. Order comes with a bowl of ramen of your choice, karaage, a bowl of white rice and a few pickled radish.   Karaage was cooked perfectly, great flavor, juicy chicken, deep fried just right to create nice texture on the outside.   I tired tonkotsu ramen and my colleague ordered shoyu. They served different size of noodles and I really like this ramen for tonkotsu. We both were taken back a little at first as shyoyu didn't have that traditional syoyu color to it but then remembered some of the iekei ramen uses white syoyu. Both tasted a tad watery at first but because of that I was able to finish the entire bowl of soup, which hardly ever happens. Especially Kyushu area ramen is too thick for my liking, I liked their broth.  Noodle was cooked good, I would have preferred noodle was bit harder (more texture to it) but I guess I wasn't eating fast enough for this kind of noodles.   Chasyu... oh wow wow wow, had a very nice flavor! Hadn't had that good and well flavored chasyu in a long time. I normally get tired of eating fatty pork belly after one but I thought I could eat more as they were cooked and flavored so well. Their egg was flavored well too. Could have had more than just a half came with standard order. Now I know, I should order extra as a side next time.  It wasn't as busy since we arrived shortly after they opened for lunch at 11am. Service was prompt and she asked if we agree on shared table before seating others at our 6 seats table. They use re-usable chopsticks, very environmentally friendly. (They even added disposable chopsticks for those who don't like reusable option). They put chopsticks in a container where you get your own from your shared table. Ive started seeing more and more of this type especially in Manhattan and LA. I like this concept, I hope more restaurant will catch up to environmentally friendly ideas.  Looking forward to coming back and hope they start serving gyoza by then.",

Servers were very kind and well mannered though - I think they were all just kind of nervous or excited that they had a huge line out the front door.   Food portion is pretty sizeable. Three pieces of chashu, 3 seaweed squares, bamboo shoots, and a plentiful amount of noodles in comparison to some other places.

    "text": "Hachi Ramen reminds me that simple can be delicious. Their menu doesn't offer you a million options to get lost in. They have 3 broth options (tonkatsu, shoyu,, miso), they only have pork, and they only have a few sides (edamame, gyoza, karaage, takoyaki). But this focus on only a few things lets them do it RIGHT.   I've had their Hachi Special ramen and the Karaage (a japanese version of fried chicken). The broth for the ramen is pretty magical. It's got little bits floating in, and some pools of melted fat floating on the top. Basically, it's what'd you get if you yourself boiled down pork or chicken to get a broth, and then you kept adding to it over time.  The pork has good fat content, and is decently thick in cut. This most certainly is not shaved meat.  The black mushrooms and bamboo shoots add flavor and temperature variance to the bowl (they are served cool).   The Karaage is something I quite enjoyed. Karaage is japanese fried chicken, and the batter and cut of the meat have to be right. The batter is supposed to have a crumbly/fried texture and lightly spiced, while the meat needs to be juicy inside. And Hachi has it down to a art. Which I'm quite pleased about, since my previous go-to japanese place has recently ruined their karaage with a completely wrong batter.   For a first visit, I'm quite pleasantly surprised. If you are looking for a good simple ramen, Hachi is the place to visit. At the very least, you should definitely give this place a try, and form your own opinion on it.   Disclaimer: I am a self-admitted salt addict. I put salt (or shoyu) on everything. For my personal preference, I think the karaage and broth could use a little additional salt. But that's why you have shoyu on every table, so it doesn't detract from my review.",

Although the soup was good it wasn't knock your socks off good, but decent for Phoenix which has a pretty terrible ramen scene. The soup was a bit weak and lacked the depth and slight creaminess that is a hallmark of a proper tokotsu. Also the chashu was really small considering the price and was mostly fat with only a sliver of meat. Noodles were a bit overdone as well. The egg however was excellent. Hopefully they can improve some aspects of the dish and make it better. Overall not bad would probably try again if I was in the area.",

So relative to that, they get a 5 Star already. Not pretentious or hipster like some of the ramen joints in downtown, just a plain ramen shop with no frills.  With that said, constructive criticism would be that the broth has too much garlic flavor and not enough of umami. Good body to the broth, but almost too much as it left a \"greasy\" feel from the combination of fat and collagen. Noodles were lacking some chew. If they used the noodles from tampopo it would be great (but tampopo broth sucks). Fried rice had good \"heat\" and was cooked well and fluffy, flavor was not bad, but missing something. Karaage chicken was ok, again, too much garlic and not enough other flavors. Price is more of $$ than $. Cost me $19 (includes tip) for a karaage combo with a fried rice side, no drink.  Staff were friendly, service was quick.",

    "text": "Maybe we went on a day that they were off their game, but I could not identify what I ate a being ramen. I lived in Japan for 31 years, and have never been upset after eating ramen, until I ate here. First, the noodles are pretty good, however I can not say the same for the broth. My wife ordered Tonkotsu, which was very watered down. It was like 1 part Tonkotsu and 9 parts water. You could identify the tonkotsu flavor if you focused, but you shouldn't have to do that. Tonkotsu should be thicker and leave a gritty taste in your mouth afterwards. It had little to no garlic in it, and True Tonkotsu needs a garlic flavor.   I ordered Shoyu ramen, but there was no shoyu in it. That was the most confusing thing to me. I didn't say anything about it because I was so confused by my wife's and my ramen. It tasted more like a chicken vegetable stew with noodles in it. I ended up adding soy sauce from the table. There was no raiyu either. The thing that upsets me most is that this establishment is owned by a Japanese person, who should know what ramen is supposed to taste like...that and I could have gone to any Safeway or Frys, picked up a $0.68 instant ramen, and it would have tasted better than what I had. It at the very least would have had shoyu flavoring. That is why I am upset.  The toppings and condiments were good. However, I am still upset, disappointed, and feel that it is an insult to the ramen world to call what we ate \"ramen\". I want to take the cooks to Ajisen or take them back to Japan and show them what ramen should taste like.  Perhaps they are trying to make ramen healthy...?...but ramen is not meant to be healthy. I am so confused by the experience. The only reasonable rational excuse I can come up with is maybe they were having a bad day, or made a very watered down broth....but shoyu ramen without shoyu is inexcusable. I am confused and debating never giving them another chance to prove this review wrong.  I might give them another chance and edit this review, but until then, this is the experience I had. I wanted the ramen to be good! I wanted to write a raving review, but I can't. It was not a good experience. I was very disappointed and felt let down.",

Hachi ramen restored my faith in in shoyu ramen, and that I don't have to wait until I fly back to LA from my business trip to get decent bowl. My last two attempts I had to leave the bowl half full and still hungry. I drove over 30 minutes away from my hotel to this place, as it had the best reviews around. TOTALLY WORTH IT. I'm sitting in my car too full to eat more, but finding myself craving another bowl. I come out to Pheonix 1-2x a month for work and unless someone I trust can give me a solid recommendation, I will go nowhere else.  The broth was on point in heat and flavor, just the right amount of savory. Not the biggest fan of egg noodles unless made well. I confirmed my suspicion when asking the owner that they were in fact homemade from scratch. He learned how to make them in Japan, just like the couple who owns my favorite place in LA. Can't beat the texture and quality, when you taste it you just know it's superior to other places. AND THAT EGG....what the hell, that egg... I honestly wish I had asked how he prepared it, because it was better than any I've had before. Little bit of yolk, not too  runny but still tender.   Oh and never had Takoyaki before so I have no comparison, but theirs Was delicious too!",

Hachi Ramen is a place that rivals anywhere I have had ramin in Japan or LA. The owner has a special heavy tonkatsu broth that is delicious and slightly creamy. My coworkers had the Miso ramen and devoured it nearly instantly. This shop will be a very frequent lunch destination for our team.",

The noodles are fresh and they have that firmness to it (not necessarily al dente) that is great in ramen dishes. The broth is delicious!

It's so messed up that you can barely put up with the smell! It's INSANELY FAT! I'll attach a picture of Tonkotsu Ramen I've ordered and what happened to it 5 minutes after! The fat on top just doesn't look attractive at all. As soon as we got our order ( me and my husband) we just looked at it, tried it and asked the waiter immediately to change the order because he first of all should have said that they make ramen out of boiled fat, not broth ( otherwise there is no chance the broth would look like that). We try ramen everywhere we go and that's like over 25+ places in the past year and we have never had anything that much disgusting. We tried to handle it politely, since we didn't eat it and ask them either to cancel the order or to replace it with a light broth.  You know what they did?!?!  They replaced just one order! It's like \"YOU GUYS CHOOSE YOURSELF WHO's GONNA STARVE AND WHO'S GONNA EAT, BUT YOU ARE PAYING FOR BOTH MEALS, EVEN THOUGH YOU EAT JUST ONE\". This is insane! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! So we just paid for the stuff and went away.  YOU CANNOT MAKE THE SITUATION MORE RIDICULOUS THAN IT IS! And by the way, I lived in Japan for over a year and I know what the real ramen is. The owner can convince me all day long that he've spend two years in Japan learning how to make Ramen, but you know what? He is a TERRIBLE STUDENT then. Worst place ever.",

My favorite ingredient would have to be the bamboo shoots. Idk what they did, but it was perfectly seasoned.

From from East Gilbert all the way to this place. When we arrived they were busy. No worries though, the hostess took our name and number and said she'd call when a table opened. We all walked across the parking lot to Home Depot to poke around. After about 15 minutes with no call we decided to head back just to make sure we were 10 feet closer and in case they didn't note the number correctly. We go back to the places and two other tables had been sat before us. Mind you, she was very clear that no one was ahead of us and that we would get the next table.   Maybe I'm making a bigger deal out of this but it felt like a slap in the face. We decided to go to Rigatoni's down the street since we were in the area. To add insult to injury I had a missed call from the restaurant when we left Rigatoni's. Which proves they had my Humber right the whole time. Just so frustrating.",

We generally order the spicy miso ramen and they are nice enough to bring us as much spice as we like.  If you like chashu then order the extra portion.  My wife and I usually split the extra order between the two of us.  The chashu is usually flavorful and tender but not quite melt in your mouth we have had.  I would say the service is usually a little slow but decent.  So if you are in a hurry you might want to let them know.  Having said all that, unfortunately, if you are somewhat well traveled you may be disappointed.  This is our go to place in the Valley until we find a better local place.  I would say the one \"up the street\" is good but my wife seems to like this one better.",

    "text": "My husband and I have driven past this humble restaurant several times and each time I would say, \"We need to try that place sometime.\" With the weather finally cooling down we decided it was time. Everyone is very friendly and I love the interior, nothing flashy, but still nice. We began with the gyoza which was very good. They instruct you to make your dipping sauce with items on your table. Very good and lots of flavor. My husband ordered the shoyu and I ordered the miso. I should state that we've had ramen at a few other places but this is by far our best. The broth in each was unique and the flavor very intense and clean. You could really taste the complexity in each broth. The eggs were so flavorful and creamy, perfection! Last and not least, the noodles were really exceptional they had a really nice chew and made the whole eating experience more enjoyable. We will definitely be back",

    "text": "Fun fact: hachi means \"8\" in Japanese and is considered a lucky number.  Would this be my lucky day for ramen?  I was excited to try out this place since I saw the signs go up in this shopping center. We got here on a Friday night and were quoted a 30 minute wait but actually got seated in maybe 10-15 minutes. Seating is a bit limited as the shop itself is small.   The namesake \"hachi\" or 8 refers to the number of ingredients in a bowl of their ramen. There are currently 4 different types to choose from: Shoyu, tonkatsu, miso, and the hachi special which comes with more chashu pork and egg. Note that getting the miso ramen or combination is an extra dollar versus getting the shoyu or tonkatsu. After browsing through their menu I decided on the miso ramen karaage combination and tried some of the tonkatsu ramen. The combination includes a side of karaage chicken, rice bowl, and a small bowl of bean sprouts in addition to the ramen of your choice.   When I got my ramen I was disappointed that there weren't any slices of pork in it, despite paying an extra dollar. On the menu too it states that the ramen bowls come with your basic toppings: 1 piece chashu, 1/2 flavored egg, black mushroom (Or corn, bean sprouts), 1 piece dry seaweed, and green onion so I was expecting some kind of meat at least in the bowl. I thought at first a brown clump spotted on my ramen was maybe ground meat but it turned out to be miso paste. The flavor of the broth itself was very light, and the bowl had the thicker, yellow crinkled kind of noodles. Quite honestly I didn't really enjoy the flavor that much and the only thing I liked about the bowl was the lovely 1/2 egg which was marinated in soy sauce with a deep gold colored soft yolk. The tonkatsu ramen I tried did have the piece of chashu pork in it which was flavorful and tender, and it came with the thinner, straight, more pale noodles that look similar to what they serve at Tampopo Ramen.   The karaage chicken was lightly battered, very juicy and tender.   If I came here again I wouldn't get the miso ramen again due to the higher cost for value but maybe another variety of ramen from here will be better!",

    "text": "Officially, this is the best authentic ramen spot in Phoenix.  Over the last year or two \"authentic\" ramen spots have been popping up in Phoenix.  (And I don't mean sorry-excuse of ramen at likes of Republic and Umami). While they all got it mostly right with the noodles, soup stock and topping, but one the one that they all do poorly is the chasui pork.  Those places either grill or flame torch the pork to a rubbery texture, yuck.  The chasui at Hachi melted in my mouth and had excellent marinated/braised flavor, you can tell it was slow cooked for hours, no short cuts were taken.   The half boiled egg was cooked perfectly with great flavor while retaining the soft gooey yolk texture.  The Tonkatsu stock was not overpoweringly salty while still maintaining great flavors without needing to add \"extra flavoring\" for additional cost.  I officially declare Hachi ramen as the best authentic Japanese ramen in Phoenix at the time of writing.",

    "text": "\"Hell, when I was growing up, I could make a meal out of a package of Top Ramen and a bottle of Windex.\"  Coolio  Hachi Ramen doesn't serve up Windex, sorry Collio, but they do offer ramen --- and it's pretty solid ramen at that!  We stopped in a few days after their grand opening and managed to grab a table without having to wait.  Our order was taken and a short wait later, the food came out.  As soon as they set our bowls of ramen and our takoyaki down, I was ecstatic.  I had ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen which came with thin straight noodles.   My noodles were cooked a bit on the longer side and wasn't the al dente consistency that I like but it still had enough texture to hold onto the broth.  The broth itself was pretty darn good!  It was thick, creamy, and sealed my lips together from the stickiness.  It looked like there was some fat swimming on top as well.  The ajitsuke egg was amazing.  It was boiled nicely and it actually has been simmered and marinated.  I also really enjoyed their fatty and tender cha shu.  Aw yis!  Their portions are definitely smaller but they're also cheaper too [almost $9 for their tonkotosu and miso ramen with the Hachi Special being $12].  As for the takoyaki, they were pretty good.  Although a bit on the smaller side, the gooey center made me rejoice.  I also got to try the broth from the Hachi Special which was lighter and more delicate than the tonkotsu.  I approve!  I definitely think Hachi Ramen is in my Top 3 favorite ramen joints in the valley.  Give this local business a try, guys!",

    "text": "Ramen expert here! Usually I try the tonkatsu ramen first at every place to see what the baseline is in order to judge their basic skills. So I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and it came out fairly quick. I approve of the noodles because most ramen I eat that are the best usually have the straight thin noodles that kind of resemble angel hair noodles. The chashu was very good! It was not tough and actually melted in your mouth. The other toppings of bamboo shoots and mushrooms complemented the noodles to make the mouthful pretty balanced. I thought there was a seaweed piece but it wasn't in the bowl. And the portion is smaller than other places. :( Of course, the final test is the broth. For a tonkatsu broth, I look for depth, consistency and of course... pork fat drippings on top of the broth. Unfortunately, there were not any drippings, but the depth and thick consistency made up for it. The broth reminds me of the broth at Dozo Izakaya which also has a thick creamy consistency. Overall, I'm approving this tonkatsu ramen because it is comparable to other ramen in California and Japan. BASICALLY, IT'S NOT WATERY BROTH. Not the best in the world, but in AZ, this is considered top tier. I think this place makes it to second place on my AZ Ramen List. Next, I will try their fancy ramen, the Hachi Ramen, which contains the whole nine yards of toppings. Hopefully it will not disappoint.  Also, I love that they have other items as well on the menu like takoyaki! Any place that serves takoyaki gets bonus points from me. :)",

    "text": "How could I possibly not come right at 11AM for the grand opening of a new ramen place!? Definitely worth it! Coming from San Diego, I'm an avid ramen enthusiast - I have my ramen joints based on what I'm craving that day (egg, noodle, broth, toppings, izakaya, etc.). Needless to say, I was stoked to see a new spot open up near my Arizona home!  I got the Hachi special, and tried a bit of the Shoyu broth, and was pretty impressed! Egg - This is SO well done and seasoned perfectly. If there's not a great egg, I will be skeptical of the ramen joint. So right away, I was excited to see the egg and it's yolky goodness. Noodles - very thin, which is how I prefer it. Also great portion of noodle! Broth - super flavorful and salty. I do wish there was a little more broth, since my preoccupation with taking photos resulted in a bad noodle:broth ratio. The Hachi broth was fairly creamy and not clear/watery. The chicken based broth of the Shoyu was also really good, but I personally prefer a pork base. If you like chicken base, the Shoyu is a great option! Chashu - YUM. The Hachi special comes with 3 thin slices and they're SO good! I also had some of the chicken (?) slices on the Shoyu, and it was so so so good.  Toppings - I love that they come with bamboo!  **My only suggestion is they add a spicy option.  Service, I recognize that I went on the first day and things are still getting hammered out. While getting our food took quite a while, I think it's because there was a packed restaurant and a line starting to form by the time 11:30AM. Servers were wonderfully friendly and ready to help.  I can't wait to see how Hachi does. I will definitely be here again, and I'm excited about a fruitful future together with this new ramen joint! ;)",

Rich, yummy broth that's better than Tampopo and Nishikawa which are both good places for ramen but Hachi beats them in flavor hands down. I got the ramen gyoza combo. Came with the tonkotsu ramen which I upgraded to the Hachi Special, rice which I updated to the chashu fried rice (which was ok, my fried rice is better), gyoza and pickled radish and cucumber (which I thought were weird but that's me). Fried rice came home with me cause I ate all the ramen which I hardly ever do. I usually leave some broth but not this time. It was that good that I cleaned my bowl.

It's crazy good, the best I've had in Arizona so far.  One warning, the soup is scalding hot. Caution to people with cat tongues!  Forgot to mention that the noodles have the slight chew and are delicately thin. The noodles complement the dish and lets the broth shine. Soaks up the broth great.   The toppings were \"top notch\"...okay bad pun. But seriously Chasu was excellent, the egg properly molten in the yolk and bamboo shoots and wood ear all good.  Very filling, you must be super hungry to throw down the large, its that rich.  Karaage is tasty though not life changing. Next time I want to try the spicy bowl and chasu fried rice which looks yummy.  Service was good and they didn't rush me so I could enjoy my meal. Seems a lot of people just hang out here.   This is a gem that I'll definitely return too. I almost want to move to Chandler so I can eat here more often.",

    "text": "Well I must say that I'm a bit disappointed.  I asked for Tonkotsu and asked if they could make it spicy. I was told that they could give me some spicy sauce, which I agreed to.   The food came quickly.  The egg was cold in the center.  The spicy sauce was on the side. About 1 teaspoon full, which I later found cost me $1.50.  The pork chashu was somewhat dry and was a very thin slice. One slice.   The noodles were cooked well and the broth was fair at best.  If I hadn't made it spicy it would have very little flavor.   The bamboo shoots were limp/wilted as if they were old and/or canned.   I suppose my quest for great ramen continues. ",

I think the chashu fried rice could have been improved if some pickled ginger was added to it. Their takoyaki was also spot on. I highly recommend Hachi.

The flavored egg was well seasoned with the semi-translucent yolk.  The bamboo shoots and good flavor and firmness. The takoyaki had a good ratio of starch and octopus and was very flavorful.

The prices for additional toppings is fair, I think. The menu uses Japanese terms but in English, which might confuse some people but that's okay. (In this case, you ask the waiter/waitress) Housewives and ASU students like to hang out here around lunchtime. South Tempe finally gets a dedicated ramen restaurant that ain't too shabby!",

I was the only customer there, which wasn't a great sign. Ordered the Tonkotsu ramen.  Quality was...mediocre. It wasn't the worst ramen I had by far (See: Ramen Master, Fort Collins CO), but it was clear this place wasn't passionate about ramen. The broth was weak for Tonkotsu, the noodles weren't ramen noodles (though it wasn't terrible), and the bamboo had the distinctive taste of the preserved cheap canned variety. Still it tasted ok as a whole.  I'm going to be generous and say 3 stars, because so far yelp hasn't revealed to me a possible better ramen place in the area and the people working there were nice enough.",

The broths are made without MSG and is very flavourful and the noodles are on point. I loved how much the corn is portioned in my bowl.  We checked in and got a plate of sesame balls which is probably the best ones I've tried. They are smaller in size than I'm used to seeing but the perfect bite size with a not overly sweet filling. The dough is not too thick and has a nice crisp to it.",

The food is bland because the food is cooked separately from the broth. If you're coming here for a great ramen experience, stick to downtown Phoenix for the best spots. If you're going to come here, do it because you live nearby and not because you think you're getting a quality meal.  I also had a bad service experience, though I think the circumstances of my arrival may have led to some of it. Let me set the scene: my friends and I walk in right after a group of eight people were set up at their own table. Each of the 7-8 tables is already filled, even the bar. After waiting about 5-10 minutes, three spots open up for me and my friends at the bar. We place our orders: two bowls of ramen and one combo meal (ramen, rice, fried chicken and pickled radish). I receive the fried chicken, rice, and pickled radish about 10 minutes after we sat down, but we didn't receive our ramen for another 20 minutes... What? No. Awful. Who wants to eat their combo with only half the food, and or be the friend to begin eating while their friends are all waiting for their food? Just weird service timing and decision-making.",

He suggested for us to try the 3 brotha & explained to us in detail what the differences between them. We also ordered their Tokayaki. Reminded me my time in Kyoto. Very tasty indeed! We highly recommend all their different ramen broths. We will come back again to bring the rest of the family!  Food was excellent & our server (Bradley) was excellent tonight. And of course, kudos to the chefs & his kitchen staff!",

    "text": "We were quoted a 30 minute wait and ended up waiting over an hour. Yes, they were busy, but there were open tables as well as dirty ones that just sat there begging to be cleaned. The seating arrangements also force you to share a table with others.  They keep their chopsticks in the center of the table with no wrapper on them. The other party seated at my table continued to play with the chopsticks we would have to use when the food came out. Super unsanitary.  Here's the worst part: I watched the kitchen pull out the pork they had been cooking and cut into it only to find out that it hadn't cooked all the way through. I kid you not, they pulled out a LIGHTER and tried to finish cooking the pork on the counter. I should have snapped a picture.  We also waited over an hour for our two ramen bowls. With the 5-6 cooks that were crammed in that small kitchen there's no reason that it should have taken that long to bring our food out.  So now we've been here nearly three hours between waiting to be seated and waiting for food. The food finally comes out and what do we find? IT'S ALL FREEZING COLD. Every single part of it - including the lighter-cooked pork.  Disappointing all around. I'd rather eat Top Ramen than come here ever again.  *In addition to the owner's comment: I understand how chopsticks work and how they were placed on the table. As I said, the other party at my table was playing with them - including the side you eat with. It's not sanitary.  I also know what I saw in your kitchen and how the pork was \"cooked\", as I was seated right next to it and paid attention. This is far from an \"accusation\", as you said, but thanks for addressing it. Your cooks were very obviously flustered when the pork came out under-cooked - a few other patrons had made comments about it as well - and they scrambled to finish 'cooking' it on the counter with a small, weak flame. Not something you'd see from a blow torch. You can explain this however you see fit, but I know what I, and others, saw.  Your turnover could have easily been handled. You created a Facebook event that over 2,000 people said they were interested in attending. Did you not think you'd end up with a mass crowd? By attending to your dirty and empty tables in a timely manner (not after 20+ minutes have passed since the last party left) the wait time for everyone would have drastically decreased. It's all simple planning.  I see you failed to address the freezing cold food that came out after such a long, dedicated wait. Does that not warrant an explanation? Why was it so cold? Because everything sat out in the open ready to be served, as your cooks focused on the under-cooked pork. As soon as they were satisfied with the pork they threw it into the prepped bowls and ran them out to the patrons. Yet, not surprisingly, the \"freshly cooked pork\" was as cold as the rest of it. Someone can get sick from that and it will be on your hands.  Anyway, perhaps invest in some heat lamps to prevent the food from chilling in the future?  Thanks for your response. I hope you will take heed of mine and others' feedback and adjust appropriately as your business grows. Best of luck to you.",

    "text": "Finding a Ramen place that serves broth that's not pork based is challenging in the valley. Hachi Ramen offers a chicken based broth so my husband and I decided to give it a try. We were welcomed as we walked in and seated immediately.   While browsing through the menu, we noticed that all the options had a piece of pork and pork fat in it. The waiter came to our table to ask us if we had any questions after he had served us our drinks. We asked about pork free options and he said they had the chicken broth and that they could skip the pork piece and pork fat. So we decided to go with that. The dish is served with an egg so I asked for mine to be without the egg. Since the dish now became just ramen, broth, green onions, bamboo-shoots and a piece of Nori, my husband was ok with that (with the egg). I decided to add corn and mushrooms to mine and I ordered a combo which is served with plain white rice, 3 fried boneless chicken pieces and pickles. We also ordered edamame and Takoyaki.  While we waited for our food, I checked in on Yelp. As a thank you for checking in, they offer sesame balls for dessert if you order food worth $30+.  The appetizers came out almost immediately. The Takoyaki was served with fish skin on top which I swear kept moving! Lol   The dish had a distinctive and delicious taste. It's basically a rice ball stuffed with octopus. It was very foreign to us but tasty. I didn't try the edamame but my husband enjoyed it.   Our bowls of Ramen came out shortly after that. They looked pretty good. I added some soy sauce to mine and tried it. It tasted good. We enjoyed the fried chicken. It had lots of flavor.   While we were eating, the waiter asked us to let him know when we are ready for dessert and we marked the offer as used.  When we finished eating, we asked for the dessert. 2 sesame balls were served. They looked perfect. When I looked up sesame ball recipes, I realized that the red paste that was in the balls was actually red bean paste. It tasted great.   Our bill was a little over $30 which is not bad. It was a good experience and the service was excellent. I just wish they had more non pork Ramen options so that they don't end up being meatless.",

I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen and we got a side of gyoza to try. The broth in the ramen had a velvety texture from the richness with flavorful pork undertones coming through. Noodles were a bit skinnier than usual ramen ones, although I liked them much better. I only felt the need to add a side of chili paste for extra heat and a dash of soy sauce since I love spicy, because overall the taste was perfect. Gyoza didn't come with sauce, you can make your own with the condiments which my husband was a little annoyed at, but we both agreed it was some of the best tasting gyoza we've had.   It's a small restaurant and there was only one guy playing waiter, yet he did an awesome job making sure we were taken care of. Super friendly staff and you can watch them cook behind the counter.  Overall I think Hachi Ramen deserves the 5-stars from our visit in my perspective. Great food and great service!",

I really liked it but for convenience i stuck to the same place that was around the corner from my apartment. Then my friend Joyce felt bad that i hadn't tried any good places so she recommended two restaurants. I tried the first one and it was way better than the only one i had before but it didn't blow my mind as expected. Then my boyfriend took me to the second place which was Hachi, and i have to say: i have been spoiled! I know i'm a ramen newbie and i have alot of places to try still but this was delicious! I liked it so much that we went a second time a few days later and it still was hella good. I ordered the spicy miso combo and it had everything i needed: spice, sides and that pork that i loved so much! Overall Hachi has great flavor, good price and good portions (although i never finish anything and this i did so maybe it's smaller portions for others, or maybe it was just too good lol). So if you're a newbie like me and want to have your mind blown: i say you must try Hachi! It is delish!",

I've been to dozens of ramen places, including Daikokuya, Rakiraki and Underbelly, but they have just never hit the spot for me. Although these places all had delicious ramen, they ran into the issue of being way too salty after a few bites. I was convinced that I would never love ramen until I found this place.  Hachi Ramen is freaking AMAZING! It was the first ramen bowl I have ever finished without feeling like it was too salty. Although I can agree with the negative reviews in that there was a lot of oil/fat in their ramen, I found that to be a plus. It didn't make me feel like I was eating a 2k calorie McDonald's meal. Rather, I felt that the fat added more depth in flavor. The noodles were deliciously chewy, the broth light yet flavorful, the chashu literally melted in my mouth, and oh my gosh have I mentioned the egg yet? The egg is sweet and has this cold yolk inside, which made a perfect contrast with the hot ramen. I have never had a soft boiled egg that was so delightful.  I had their takoyaki as well and it was very delicious but did not stand out as much as their ramen did. Their staff are very nice and polite as well, and the food came out promptly. I will definitely be coming back.",

Had the hachi shoyu ramen special chicken broth noodle, egg, mushroom. Broth made from scratch perfect blend with optional chili oil and soy on table.   I added homemade gyoza (potstickers) with vinegar and soy (on table) in a dish and a coke  Words can't describe how good this is. ! Mouthwatering. Savory. Flavorful. The pork was tender melts in your mouth. Most Defintely will be back!!!!   I'm from Sacramento California where they have a legit ramen house downtown and this is right up there.",

    "text": "For reference, I lived in areas with outstanding ramen in Korea, Japan, and New York City. So this review is not limited to local experience but well-informed.  I will start with a positive, Hachi delivers an authentic tasting ramen that most ramen shops in the Phoenix area fail to do. The broth is clearly simmered and reduced all day and made from with a dashi that has a subtle umami that doesn't simply come from MSG thrown into a pot like many other ramen shops.  That being said, two basic misexecuted techniques ruined my experience here.   1) Oil/Fat I love fat and am the type of person who drinks my coffee with a knob of butter or tbsp of coconut oil. But this place overdid it. The fried rice was so oily that I could not palate the interesting flavors thrown in there. It was pretty drenched. Same goes for the kareage which soaked in too much oil in the batter. The oil may have been too cold when the fry started. Finally the ramen broth had too much fat in it. I ordered shoyu and excepted to palate some good umami from the soy but was overwhelmed by the amount of fat lingering in the broth. Had they clarified the broth a bit, I would have really enjoyed the broth.   2) Salt I love salt. I am the type of person who puts on salt on watermelon, in thai iced tea, and in my coffee. But again, no finesse here. The kareage was salted to the point that I only had one piece and left the rest behind. I hate wasting food but could not bear it. The fried rice also had too much saltiness probably from a heavy hand with the soy sauce or possibly the chashu already had a lot of salt in it.   Hachi has good bones. They do it the right way. There just needs to be more balance and nuance, especially considering that is the Japanese culinary tradition. Maybe more use of mirin or yuzu to balance the fat. But definitely less salt.",

Broth is so savory, and the noodles are cooked perfect! I really like the portion size for the amount you pay. Customer service was great and I'll definitely be back!",

What interests me the most is how they're able to pack so much flavor into the broth, which takes several hours to get it this savory- and you can definitely tell!! My personal favorites include the crispy homeade gyoza and chashu fried rice. My husband loves the homeade karaage, which doesn't compare to any other fried chicken elsewhere. I really appreciate Brad the owner, he is always super friendly and personable. Thank you Brad for making bomb food and creating such a fantastic authentic restaurant that I am able to enjoy with my friends and family!",

Everything is made from scratch, owner is a nice Mongolian guy with a Japanese food obsession and he does pretty good about keeping it as authentic as it can be anyways. He speaks Japanese too, which is nice.   Review would be closer to 1 star based on most recent visit: Tonkotsu broth is weak, cha siu pork is charred with a blowtorch for some reason when it should just be left alone roasted so it's not really edible. But it's actually just pork tenderloin so... shrug.  Hachi used to be better when the owner was there all the time and did most of the cooking himself - back then only the servers were subpar, lately the broth is like water and the pork is undercooked and then charred to look nice but tastes like gas.   The menu used to be better too, but maybe they were losing money having more items.   If they have anything on the chalkboard as a special, get that.",

Adorable little place with a flare of traditional decor. The music is Japanese and relaxing -- as it should be. No blaring top 40's here, kids!  Had the miso ramen with extra chashu, no egg. Boyfriend got the tonkotsu with extra chashu, no egg, with spicy sauce. I added a bit of the spicy sauce to my miso, it gave it the right amount of bite. Also, got their gyoza for an appetizer and finished up dinner with their promotional offer of sesame balls -- spent $30 get two sesame balls free!  I prefer the miso ramen to the tonkotsu because it is more flavorful and rich, but that's just preference as the tonkotsu is one of the best I've had. The spicy sauce is excellent and adds heat without masking the flavor of the broth -- as spice should be!!  If you're looking for the best ramen in Phoenix, you've found it. The wait is over.",

Ramen is some of the best in Phoenix area, and this has become a monthly stop in for me. Prices are very fair and bowls are big and tasty. You will love the miso ramen here as it is different from other places.   Just fair warning, the only small issue I have is I this this place may use more sodium then other ramen establishments, as I can feel it later In the day. But it could just be me.   Bonzi!   A+",

We got seated immediately and they brought our food to us at a decent time.  Got the Karaage combination and the Karaage was delicious! It was made fresh, crunchy, and well seasoned. The tonkatsu ramen broth seemed a little watered down and the noodles were a little too al dente. Meat and toppings in the ramen were good, but a little too much mushroom for my liking.   Overall, if you're trying to dip into the ramen world, this spot isn't bad for a first time. There is definitely better, but this place was just okay. I highly recommend getting the karaage.  When checking in, you can get a free sesame ball if your order is over $30!",

I was seated at the counter, and since it was busy during lunch hours, I was very cramped and felt that my personal space was being invaded by the two people on either side of me.  They are reasonably priced, especially during lunch time. Great place to go if you work nearby and need some food that isn't Carl's Jr. or another fast food joint. Staff is very attentive as well.",

Good ramen (I got the spicy miso) with a side of fried rice and karaage, and my only complaint with the whole place was that it could have used a little more salt in the rice, but they got the consistency and overall feel of what I used to get back in Japan.  The set will put you back $20 after tax but it's hard for one person to finish it all and they can box up leftovers.  Very nice staff, clean, easy parking, very good service.",

Both the times during my visit the place had pretty good number of people. Its like a quick sit, eat and leave kind of restaurant.   I have tried their Shoyu, miso ramen and their appetizer Takoyaki. Somehow I am not very convinced on the taste of their broth. I liked Miso ramen but it had very less meat than what I would expect. My favorite of the three I tried were the appetizer. It was really good and would go for it again.  My friends love this place but I am not a fan though. May be its just that I have tried better broths and ramen in other places. Their options are a hand few and once in a while works good but definitely not on my rotation for sometime. The price is average but again less meat for a $12 ramen.",

Ended up it was a large party, which if there is more than five you maybe better off splitting up. Not to many tables to begin with and bigger groups not suggested on a busy night.  Broth was good and especially liked it because it was not salty like other places.   Ordered the Hachi Ramen and the Combination with Tonkotsu and Karage Chicken. The Hachi Ramen has about everything offered on the side, not sure what it was maybe the seaweed but did not care for the one particular item.  The Karage Chicken was tasty and very tender, would order that again.  Our waitress was very good and did everything to make our experience good.  Small menu of items, but that is not a negative, just make good ramen.",

    "text": "I stayed in Tempe over the weekend and was craving some soup and noodles. I love ramen and noticed the rave reviews here so my husband and I decided to give this place a chance. Mind you, we are from LA, and have plenty of delicious ramen options.  I noticed that the staff was not Japanese. That's not always a bad thing, but looking back it should have been a red flag. It appeared to be busy, but we were seated pretty quick, within 10 minutes.   I ordered the hachi shoyu ramen and my husband ordered the hachi tonkotsu ramen. We also ordered a chashu fried rice and takoyaki as well. The appetizers came out first. Some of the takoyaki were still cold inside. The chashu fried rice barely had any pork in it. Also, it tasted more like Chinese fried rice than Japanese fried rice, which should have been a second red flag.  After nearly 50 minutes of waiting for the ramen, they finally arrived at our table. The first thing both my husband and I did was taste the broth. The shoyu broth tasted like soup you get at a Chinese restaurant. The tonkotsu broth was a little bit better. The flavored egg wasn't quite right. The pork was a bit chewy.  The best part of the bowl was the seaweed. The noodles I got were thicker than the noodles my husband got... the inconsistency was just strange.  I really didn't like the food and the wait here. It definitely was not worth it for me.",

The octopus balls burned the living daylights out of my mouth, so let them sit for a hot second before chowing down. The ramen was good, I feel like I had some hot and cold spots in my bowl when I got it so I had to distribute the warmth.   All of this was okay, but when it came time to pay I feel like we were completely forgotten about. We asked for the check twice and it still took them 20 minutes to get us the check. That's the only reason for a 4 star review.  Take out looked incredibly popular, I would try that next time so I don't have to wait so long for my check.",

We were quickly greeted and seated as we walked in. The two employees working were very friendly and attentive.  We looked over the menu and we knew what we wanted. I wanted ramen with the chicken broth and the hubby wanted the spicy ramen.   I added more bean sports, mushrooms, a side of the chili, and green onions to mine, while my husband ordered extra pork and noodles for his.   We didn't have to wait too long for our ramen to arrive. I was in heaven. The bowl smelled delicious when it was brought out to us, and so we dug in immediately. The bowls looked small when they were placed right in front of us, but no, we couldn't even finish them!   Portions are big and there is no need to order extra ramen as the bowl already has a lot. My broth was delicious!   We shared a melon soda and it reminded me of the melon soda I used to drink in South Korea. Yum!  We really enjoyed this cute place and will be back again sometime!   Oh and yes I love ramen nowwwwww!",

Hachi ramen delivers a very good ramen and probably one of the best ramen in the east valley.   One thing I love about them is they make their broth daily and it's a nice clean broth. Add just a little chili oil.and soy sauce, it's perfect! The noodles are good but nothing special and the chashu pork pretty tasty. Honestly I really enjoyed the egg in the soup. It's a nice sweet taste with a perfectly cooked yoke. I can eat those all day!   We also had the gyoza which is hand made on the spot and tasted awesome. I appreciated they give you vinegar for the gyoza. Love to have that vinegar with soy sauce blend for the gyoza. We did order a side of the fried rice which is delicious with the added bits of chashu pork. Yummy!  All around good food and good environment with nice people. Check this place out!",

I wish while waiting they'd offered s menu to review, but then again it's a simple menu and easy to get through.   I had the spicy ramen and my friend had the hachi special. Both were fantastic. I'm definitely interested in repeating the experience! If you don't like crowds try going after 7.30 or before 5 for the smaller crowd, it was much calmer when we were leaving. Our server also indicated during the week it's a bit less crowded as well.   The place is a simple ramen shop, limited options, small menu. But, well prepared, fairly quick, and absolutely delicious!  Parking was easy, it's in a large shopping center. And you'll definitely smell it before you get in the door! Give it a shot.",

Their soft boiled eggs are cold but are cooked well, not like a lot of other ramen places that have hard boiled eggs posing as a onsen tamagos. Their pork is also very char broiled and flavorful.  Service has always been attentive and friendly. It's a small place so be aware that it can become very busy quickly.",

They have a token white guy that works there lol, and he seemed new, a little lost as to where to be. They had college basketball on the TV which I was interested in and was actively watching. Their boy noticed I was craning my neck to see around him but he made no attempt to move, even stood in front of me so I couldn't even see the TV. No big deal, just nit-picking since I grew up in the restaurant industry. Otherwise good experience in store.  Ordered to-go items for my GF and son. Another Hachi Ramen, takoyaki and chashu friend rice. Very little broth came with it which was disappointing. Didn't cover the noodles and everything at all. Takoyaki was great. Opened the fried rice to find a hair in it (pictured), so I tossed it, I don't mess around with that kind of stuff so can't say how it tasted.   Mixed feelings but I'll be back to try it again.",

Their was a total of 4 workers in the entire place(including the cooks) and they were each working so hard to provide their best possible service. The restaurant had a good amount of people dining as well.   I really wanted to love this place, but the ramen bowl just did not do it for me. I had the Hachi Ramen that I saw so many people rave about in other reviews and my boyfriend had the pork based Ramen. Both had a heavier base and left me feeling sluggish afterwords. I appreciate the care of the staff, but for me this Ramen did not compare to other places I have been.",

The only part of my experience that I didn't like was that there's no ground beef options, which I always get with my ramen.

I get it, it's ramen - it should be some sort of salty whether it's tonkotsu pork-based broth, soy sauce based, or chicken. However, I can only do so much. This place is authentic and not too salty! I love it! If you are like me and think some ramen is like sodium-overload, I highly recommend you try this place out.

    "text": "I love this place. I went there for my first time today, and fell in love! I got the tonkastu ramen which came with a chashu slice (pork), green onion, bamboo shoots, black mushrooms, and a seasoned egg. First let me say this place has the best chashu I've tasted. It wasn't overly fatty, and I know some people like that, but I don't haha. It had a perfect charred taste to it. The noodles are the thin noodles that I LOVE! You can also get extra noodles on the side for $2.00 more, for when you're left with just broth at the end of your bowl ;) speaking of which, the broth. It's amazing. It's full of flavor, not super salty, and it's creamy. Even my picky eater boyfriend liked it! I am so glad Arizona is getting more and more ramen shops. I will definitely be back here again!",

    "text": "It's good but \"\" (Imaichi)  - as we say in Japan, it is just \"Not quite\" there. Noodles are great. Toppings are good. But the broth falls short, wich is too bad because it is the crown jewel of Ramen.  Apparently, the owner takes the time, effort and pride in this broth. And it shows. The broth has the wonderful glorious look to it with the promise of rich and flavor-packed goodness. However, as you take the first sip,  you are left perplexed and ultimately dissapointed. The broth has good authentic pork/veggie stock. It is the seasoning that is seruouely lacking. Needs more salt and flavor. I now tried all three flavors; Tonkotsu, Miso and Shoyu. They are not very distinguishable other than a very slight hint of miso or soy sauce (\"shoyu\") in the background. They are all missing salt. I hate to admit, but I had to do the dreadful insult of adding soy sauce to their Ramen.   Overall,  I am still happy that Hachi is here for the locals. This is the closest thing we have that resembles Ramen shops in Japan. Small menu, focus on a few special things and do them well. Hachi got the right model. They just have to do a little better. I still keep going back and am hopeful that I'll be surprised one day.",

We ordered the Tonkotsu and Miso soup, as well as the fried rice and octopus dishes. The food was ready in a good amount of time and the pricing was comparable for the most part.  In opening the food at home we were immediately disappointed as the amount of broth was half of what we get from our usual ramen place and unfortunately we continued to be disappointed in the meal. The soup tasted greasy and the meat was fatty. The octopus smelled horrible but we have never had this before, so that may have been normal. The only good thing about the food was the fried rice-which was not terrible but edible and tasty for the most part.  What we learned from this experience is \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it!\"",

I'm personally not a fan of thin noodles (their noodles seemed to be the same as the noodles at Tampopo, for you other ramen maniacs), so that was a bummer, but I won't mark them off for a preference. My fiance and I both got the tonkotsu and thought the broth was too salty and not consistent with our previous experiences of tonkotsu (broth should be white, etc.). HOWEVER (big however), their chashu was delicious!! Oh man, so good. I wouldn't come back for the ramen, but I might come back to try their chashu fried rice!

The last time I went we ordered the Takoyaki, which I was intrigued  by because I love octopus, but I was underwhelmed. It had a good flavor but the inside was still mushy and later on gave me some stomach troubles.   Overall if I were with someone who wanted to try it, I'd go, but I wouldn't be the one to mention it.",

    "text": "I chose this hidden gem for my birthday dinner & Hachi Ramen did not disappoint!! Watched way too much Naruto with my husband enough to want to try miso chashu ramen lol  Did a little research on the place & also read in the Phoenix new times that this was the spot for some authentic ramen. So why not!  From the outside it looks average but once you walk in the owner & his employees greet you in Japanese. You're seated & he asks you if you've ever had ramen, explains everything on the menu & answers any questions. From there you can order just a bowl of ramen or a combination meal. This consists of rice (white or fried chashu rice) the chashu, is really good pork belly. You get a side of friend chicken or octopus, or potstickers. They'll make you whatever you like fresh. Everything is pretty much made to order.  I got the Karaage combination which is the miso chashu ramen with fried rice and the fried chicken.  Literally, the ramen changed my life. I've never had ramen this good ever, the stuff we've been eating from the plastic bowls are all frauds lol  The ramen is a good sized portion and you can definitely tell the noodles are made fresh. The broth is so amazing & rich, full of flavor.  & the owner definitely takes care of you, our drinks were never empty and we were checked on periodically throughout our dinner to see if we needed anything. Definitely quality customer service.  He even made up a side of sesame balls when he found out it was my birthday. Never had them before but it was yummy also.  If you want to try authentic ramen this is your spot. They're closed for 2 hours midday but only because the broth for the ramen is made fresh daily. It's definitely worth the wait & the visit",

I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with the egg type noodles and the karage chicken. I absolutely loved the tonkotsu broth. It was nicely seasoned and had that great pork flavor. The egg and yolk with not only cooked well but had been marinated fantastically with soy and mirin. The noodles themselves were great with just enough chewiness to give me that texture that I love. The Karage chicken was also cooked perfectly and chicken was juicy on the inside.  Overall, if you're looking for fast friendly service at an amazingly authentic ramen restaurant in Chandler, Arizona, Hachi's a great choice.",

The dishes have had lots of flavor and I prefer the wavy noodle to the straight, so I'm really pleased they offer both and distinguish which is offered in each bowl.  We usually start by splitting an order of takoyaki and then delve into our ramen bowls.  Can't wait to make it in again, I've been daydreaming of ramen!  Mmmmmmm extra egg, extra chashu....",

The chef (who studied in Japan for two years) came out and explained the menu to us very thoroughly. I got the Miso and he laughed at me when I asked if it tasted like Miso soup. It definitely did not taste like what you'd think for Miso at a sushi place or something and was fabulous. Everything was clean as well and the service staff very attentive. Glad we picked them for a first time.",

    "text": "Brand new ramen spot in Tempe tucked away in a shopping plaza you would never expect a ramen shop to be in. Crazy lines because it was the grand opening so it was well worth it. And word on the street was at 1pm they closed due to running out of noodles! They opened back at 6pm We waited maybe 45 minutes with others to get seats. Service was a bit slow but for a full house with lines out the door on opening night the guys at Hachi did their best to keep moving and get everyone their food and drinks. We got our food and it was the perfect temperature. The ramen was delicious just the right amount of flavors. We also tried the Chashu fried rice and the karaage. Awesome! Will be back for sure! I imagine there will be lines every day as this place is going to be a hot spot. Congratulations on your opening!!",

I got the takoyaki (octopus balls) as an appetizer and loved the crispy batter on the outside and the octopus on the inside was tasty! This is something I'd only order to share as an appetizer though because I get tired of it after eating 2/3 pieces. Moving on to the ramen, I got the the tonkostu ramen and I was not fond of the broth. It was more on the creamy/thicker side and I prefer to have it be smooth. The noodles were thin and The egg was the best egg I ever had in my ramen and I loved the bamboo! Overall, this place was pretty good and I would come back again whenever I'm around the area.",

    "text": "As an avid ramen fan, I was thrilled to see another ramen restaurant open up in Tempe. I drove past the first 2 nights and saw long lines for the grand opening and decided to come back on Thursday. I ordered the Hachi Special and I have to say for $15 dollars after tip, I expected more. The broth was underwhelming, the noodle portion was small, and not really the type of ramen noodle I expected. The redeeming qualities were the 3 pieces of char sui pork, and the soft boiled egg. Although the portion of pork was nice, it seemed to be under-cooked and just not very hot. Even after being in the soup. Overall, I think I would go back and try a different ramen bowl. But if it's anything like this experience, I will stick with tampopo or Dozo. The best place I have had Ramen in AZ btw, is Hot Noodles and Cold Sake in Scottsdale.",

First, the service was attentive and friendly.  I ordered the special with extra egg and pork and added corn.  I'm so glad I did.  The egg was cooked in a perfect soft boiled manner with the yolk very creamy.  The Char Siu Pork was absolutely fantastic.  The layers of fat melted in your mouth with no heaviness.  Just pure heaven.  The owner cooks every thing on premise from scratch.  Highly recommend!!!",

    "text": "Unfortunately, the second time here was not any better than the first. There service was way faster and they had Miso available this time. So of course I had to try the elusive Miso. Not impressed, first you have to mix in the soybean paste yourself which made the soup grainy feeling. It didn't feel like it was cohesive with the broth. I asked about the meat and if any came with it, they told me it was mixed it with the paste. Side note I picked out something chunky and not paste from the paste and it turn out it was supposed to be the \"meat\". I tried what picked out which I had put on a napkin....edible? would not call it meat or \"meat\". The rest of the miso ramen was not  impressive and almost anything would have been better. My boyfriend had the chashu bowl and he was not impressed either, he said he only got through it, by drenching it with chili oil. I'm not trying to be harsh, but I feel I was let down a lot by this place-I had such high hopes.",
