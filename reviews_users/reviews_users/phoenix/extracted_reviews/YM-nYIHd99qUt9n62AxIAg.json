Food is great starting with the chips, salsa and cheese crisp to the main meal!  A ton of food and always delicious!  Works well for large groups, celebrating a birthday or watching the big game!  Also great for catering!",

So my son and I wandered over to this restaurant, having not been before, just recognizing the name. Walking in, it felt large and clean. It took a while to be seated, and when we did we were put in a corner booth. The waitress was nice, but short with her words. I ordered the chicken chimi with red sauce, and got my son the bean burrito kids meal. Food was just okay. I find myself only coming on here to write so so reviews, and maybe that's not fair as im picky! Probably due to being stuck in a corner booth, the waitress didn't check on us once, and I had to flag her down to get my bill. I suppose if you live in the neighborhood it would be okay to check out, but I wont be back. There are too many other authentic places in town to come here.",

    "text": "Oh man.  Where do I start with this place?  I absolutely love it.  The only reason it doesn't have 5 stars is because it has a devastating effect on your waistline with frequent visits.  A look around at your fellow diners will confirm the fate that you too will suffer if you don't mend your gluttonous CO ways.  Eat in moderation - especially here.  Then again, that really shouldn't deter you from stopping in. Especially if it is your birthday - because this is THE PLACE FOR BIRTHDAYS!  Every single time, without fail, and more predictable than the US Mail - someone is celebrating their birthday.  When I would go often, it was understandable.  But now that I go much less frequently (for reasons stated above - yes I fell victim to it), it is amazing.  My 2x a year visit, and it happens to be someone's birthday.  I wish I had those odds with the lottery.    They have some of the best chip's and salsa in town and great beers, both in the bottle and on tap.  And they just keep 'em coming....free of charge, like it should be.   My favorite sunday afternoon past time would be hanging at the bar, drinking XX Lager, and consuming mountains of chips.  The burritos are excellent to - although I tend to stick to the bean burrito with enchilada style (with red sauce) since it does well left over.  And trust me, leave some food on your plate.  Or suffer the consequences (see above).  Cheese Crisps, Nachos, Fajitas and tacos are pretty tasty.  Everything is smothered in cheese, beans, and rice and served on hot colorful plates...just like comfort mexican food should be.  I have never been disappointed with any visit to CO, well, except the time I found out they stopped serving the  choc-star-lite mints after dinner.  That was a real downer.",

Maybe, but it's still a pretty big place) and there is this strange swing hanging from the rafters in one part of the restaurant.  I really wonder what it used to be.  But, now it's Carlos O'Brien's.  If you are dining in, order the queso dip.  It is delicious! But that's really all I would recommend.  Everything else is mediocre and super cheesy.  However, if you are using them to cater, I say order the mini chimis, mini tacos and mini flautas.  Great price to feed a large party at your house.  Also, with the size, there is never a wait.",

The service is great, the manager Ken is very friendly and welcoming every time you come through the door.  The plates of food come out with enough to take home for leftovers, so to enjoy again! Since the pates are so big, it fattens your waistline! I order a pitcher of the top shelf margaritas every time and boy do they have a good amount of tequila in it!  The fajita grilled cheese is stuffed with bell peppers and strips of either steak or chicken and plenty of cheese. I usually order the chicken chimi, which is stuffed with shredded chicken a side of sour cream, and the fixings of tomatoes, lettuce, beans and Spanish rice.   Order the fried ice cream and it complements your whole meal! It is a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream rolled in browned corn flakes and then topped with honey and chocolate syrup.  A great atmosphere and family restaurant  .",

I went with high expectations because she has told me over and over the past few years how good this place is.  I arrived couple minutes after everyone was there and saw that the party (there was about 25 of us) was broken sort of into you, half the party down one side and other wrapped around the middle and the birthday girl was kind of not at either tables, just in the middle of the 2, which made it difficult for conversations to flow, you could talk to your half of the table, but if you want to talk with those on the other side of the restaurant, get up and walk over their then, needless to say, I stayed where I was at and talked amongst my fellow friends on my side, kept giving the bday girl a shout out and drinks to let her know we are here to party!   Let's start with the salsa, their where 2 types, a pico de gallo and a hotter blend, which reminded me more of a smoky chipotle sauce.  Well the pico looked great, but had absolutely no flavor, no pepper ,no onion, no tomato flavor, not even the cilantro, which is my favorite ingredient to cook with, had flavor, even if you added salt and pepper to it, it didn't help.  The hotter of the two did have a nice smoky chipotle taste to it, so that was the one I went with it.   I went with the filet of Salmon with mango salsa with Spanish rice and black beans.  The fish was perfectly cooked, and even though the top of the fish appeared to have some sort of rub on it, it too was lacking in flavor, I tossed on the mango salsa to see if that would help and sadly it did not, no flavor at all. I topped it with the smoky chipotle to give some sort of flavor and appearance that I'm not eating mush. The rice and beans were perfectly cooked, no issues there.  Had this dish had flavor to it, it would have been amazing, but nope it did not.  Now like I said we were spilt into 2 along one sided booth table things from one end of the room to the other, and there was apx 25 if not more of us. But by the time my end of the table had gotten their food, the other half was already paying and leaving.  It was not because I was late; I got their in time for orders to be taken. This was poor planning on the server's behalf, half the party had ready left by the time we got our bills.  I was bummed because I was wanting to catch up with a friend I hadn't seen in a while and poof she was gone .  I wanted to like this place, but I'm afraid I am a onetime diner here.",

What a disappointment yes we were a table of 9 but it took over 45 minutes to get our food the restaurant was not that busy since it was 8 p.m. example the server brought the fajitas without the tortillas and said she'd be right back that never happened I would have like to order another drink but it actually have to find someone to help you.  After waiting that whole time for the food the food was cold.  We had asked for more chips since it was 45 minutes without food she said she'd be right back no more chips. I always start from 20% tip and either go up or down obviously I went way down",

    "text": "Hello Yelp,  So i gave this establishment a go opening week and needless to say it was a flop. The service was far from par.... Granted it was grand opening week and I understand things get missed and messy so I get it but the lack of training and basic knowledge a restaurant staff should have about their menu was scary . I sat down in the bar area around 8pm the restaurant was overall busy, the bar area maybe had 2-3 tables with people sitting down so that being said i waited almost 15 mins before being offered a menu, few mins later i asked for the beers on tap or if any drinks were on special for taco tuesday server said she had to check on that few mins went by returned with no answer about my question i walked over to the bar area where i read the taps of beer on draft. I ordered a tower station IPA which was amazing. For food i went safe with Carne Asda Tacos, my gf had ordered chicken nachos for a app, needless to say 20 mins went by after my beer was finished and i asked for another beer and also if she could check on the food she came back with the food and of course nachos were cold and tacos also.. she came back shortly after  we ordered and i got my check shortly did not finish my food.   So..... second take  we live in North Phoenix so we decided to give them another try this time it was a take out experience. 9/1/17   we called in a order for a Mexican Pizza with ground beef on top. and a Chicken Chimi meal. Server said the order will be ready in 30 mins sweet! we go to pick up the food and the take out host could not find it do to not remembering the name so they left under the phone number.......roughly 8 mins go on and a server comes out to ask me a question about my order and i told her what we ordered and the host then recalls oh ya we didnt kno how to spell my name so she put it under a phone number but didnt tell anyone or write it down for the host to be able to find it.... haha go figure right. over all  food seemed to be accounted for but, the mexican pizza was 16.95 due to not having the item on the menu ok fair enough the pizza was cold the cheese was stiff very stiff the pizza was also not even cut with a pizza cutter completely in tact, the chimi was however ok just shredded chicken wrapped in a tortilla,  so overall this place is literally 0/2 for us and we wont be checking back in only for drink not  get me wrong the craft beer they have is amazing and its not their fault the staff really doesnt know whats going on or how to properly take out food upon the category of the food.. I wish i could say better things because i have friends who love their other locations and rave about it. Honestly  people just go to VALLE  LUNA..... this location has  alot of work to do starting with the right staff to train these people on how a restaurant needs to be run you cant  serve cold food to customers its not right....     Sincerly Roger",

The jalepeno cheese muffins were good. Had a strange fluffy cheese scooped on stuff. Just very confusing.   Fajitas. These were some straaaaange fajitas. The beef was a curled up over cooked version of meat. Certainly not a nice medium rare grilled fajitas. The vegetable medley was very confusing too. It had zucchini and other \"stirfry-type\" veggies. What?  Chips and salsa. Chips were good. Salsa was a strange stewed tomatoes and stewed bell peppers?!? All seemed like out of an old unmarked can in the corner of a pantry.  The other \"spicy\" salsa tasted powdery and not fresh.   Even the Beer-Rita and on-tap beers tasted odd.   Overall, confusing and strange.",

Being in town visiting family, someone chose this place for a group dinner.  It wasn't me.  I vaguely remembered liking it as a child and ignored the Yelp reviews.  The menu was typical Arizona Mexican food (the Carlos) and \"pub\" food (the O'Brien)  I had no expectation of authenticity or gourmet ingredients.    The space is huge and it was fairly busy but not packed.  The decor is straight out of 1980, which actually was a bit charming.  Our server was personable and did a great job. The food was TERRIBLE.  I mean really awful. The hot salsa tasted of nothing but ground chiles and the mild salsa was worse than bottled grocery store stuff and just tasted like sugar and tomatoes.  The chips were good, but with nothing good to put on them it didn't really matter.  My food was beyond bland, and everyone agreed.  We dumped the hot salsa on everything to even make it palatable. I think we had a total of eight different dishes and nobody liked any of them except the cheese crisp (and one person didn't even like that).  My margarita was terrible, tasted like straight from the plastic bottle margarita mix and had very little alcohol and almost no salt.  There is no way I would come here again or recommend it to anyone.",

A great value for 8.50, plus a margarita for 2.50 which was great as well.  The shreded beef taco was very good, though I didn't get any gucamole or sour cream with it, I suppose I should have asked for it.  The cheese enchilada was good, but I do agree with the other posters that they pile up the cheese on their food, atleast the enchilada.  The plates are sloppy to look at and when eating the food, the plate turns into a mess.  For the value, you can't go wrong, but I do think they can make some simple changes to better the food look wise and not mase their food with so much cheese.   I did have the mini chimi's years back and I remember how doughy and the lack of taste they had, not sure if they improved those at all.",

The second time was OK, but not as good as the first time, but we enjoyed ourselves, thinking it was an off day that evening.  Last night we had our friends with us and it was horrible.  Quantity was not the problem, there was plenty.  The St. Gria was served in short stemmed glasses with LOTS of ice.  We had large glasses before with little ice twice before.  One in our party had to exchange their meal for something else because it was so bad.  He couldn't even identify the kind of meat he was trying to eat. Another in our party, and myself, couldn't finish most of our meal, chicken tacos, because it lacked any flavor.  The beans were fine but the rice, this time was very dry. Meat tasted as if it had been boiled without any spices. All of us left plenty of food on our plates without any thought of taking leftovers home.  On the way home we talked about how disappointing the meal was, and how the quality had gone down so much. We concluded that it would be a LONG time before we frequent O'Brien's again, if ever.",

I really have nothing good to say about any part of our visit. Having been in the restaurant business myself I can be pretty forgiving when it is obvious that the place is understaffed and I am willing to be patient as long as it is acknowledged that I am sitting there waiting...instead we literally waited (at the bar) for 15 minutes without either one of the bartenders making so much as eye contact. I finally had to wave my arms before somebody said Hi. I was not the only one having this problem as both people to either side on me had been waiting longer than we had and a couple of the tables gave up and left. We finally placed our order of queso dip and a chimichanga with a bartender that was less than thrilled. The queso was really bad and chimi was mediocore at best. Nobody ever asked if there was an issue with the queso as the bowl was literally untouched. On the upside the chips and salsa are still good. We paid our tab and bailed. I made a quick stop to the restroom only to find it out of soap with the trashcan overflowing and paper towels all over the floor. All and all a very disappointing trip. Carlos O'Briens needs to make a serious effort to get their restaurant back to what it used to be.",

The happy hour men is not on any of the bar tables so you have to ask for it.  Once reviewed we discovered the online menu had things on it that did not appear on the in person menu.  In addition, we looked at a regular menu also---they really need to clean them off before giving them to customers.  The food was very average.  We observed the bar to be almost empty during the happy hour times (3:30-6:30) now maybe because it was a Sunday but we thought that was also odd.  There was one bartender and one bus boy.  Perhaps this place would be o.k. for take out in a pinch otherwise a drive a little further South would take us to Valle Luna.",

While the server was personable, I don't know if he was overwhelmed or just having a bad night.

Lots of cumin in wife's beef burrito. After reading reviews looks like maybe they changed cooks about a year ago. Hope they realize before they lose all business.",

We went with the flow assuming that most likely the food was not going to be the most delicious and amazing food ever but that it was going to be edible. Well , we were wrong , the food is disgusting , zero flavor, old tasting beans and rice , old guacamole- it was not green like it is supposed to be when it is fresh but brown looking. They also add so much melted cheese on every plate. Overall gross, not authentic food, but old food with a block of melted cheeses and sauces to make them look \"pretty\". If you want real authentic and fresh Mexican food go to Comedor Guadalajara on Central Ave.",

Come on. I will not trust four square reviews ever again. People will still go here because of the location and parking and they are from wherever and don't know good Mexican food, but if you really want good Mexican food, Ajo Als on 16th street is the most consistent in quality and price.

You could tell it was leftover from the day before. It was thick and orange in color, The flour tortilla were dk brown, not golden like they should be. In general the food quality has gone down drastically. We can eat at Ariba's twice for the price of one poor quality dinner at Carlos O'Brien's.",

First, it was nearly empty-another bad sign.  Then, the waiter seemed to be a friendly guy, but not good at waiting tables.  I never got enough water, my date didn't get an offer of another drink...  The food.  Oh boy.   I have never in my life tasted frijoles that tasted like they were made with dried french onion soup mix before. The salsa verde had the same bizarre flavor. We ordered two different dishes, and they were both indistinguishable-and not good.  The decor is strictly 1979 dark wood, and the railing for the steps had a handwritten sign on it that said something like, \"this is not a seat.\"  It wasn't expensive, but Juliobertos has MUCH better food, so who cares?

But its one of the only Mexican American restaurants that I have returned to regularly over the years. I've been to several other Mexican American restaurants in the valley and I've never had any desire to return to any of them......Except for Carlos O'Briens.   The staff here are always friendly and attentive. This restaurant gets busy. Lots of families, couples,  groups. If your alone you'll also  feel very welcome too. The staff has a way of making everybody feel comfortable.  If you so desire you can sit at the bar for a drink and have your meal served to you there.  They have all of the usual Mexican American  Fare. If you are health concious, they offer a separate menu. This is the menu I always order from. But just so you know........ They may not automatically offer the alternative menu. So you my have to request it.  When your seated they ask your drink choice and then come back with your drink and a basket of freshly made corn chips and 2 large bowls of salsa one mild and one medium if you want a hot one just ask.  If you finish the chips and salsa they will bring you more. All complimentary.  The chips and salsa are pretty good. We all dig right in and we find ourselves munching away until our food arrives.   So many memories of dinning Here over the years. Thank you Carlos O'Briens.  Wish you many more year of success.",

They offer a few vegetarian options such as chile relleno and spinach enchiladas.  Chips and 2 types of salsa are served at the table prior to ordering.  The chips are very thin, and the mild salsa is very tomato based, while the hot salsa tastes a bit more authentic with a good robust chile flavor.  Feeling like I needed more greens in my diet, I opted for the spinach enchiladas for my dinner.  The enchiladas themselves tasted OK flavor-wise, but while I appreciate that they used fresh spinach, it wasn't cleaned very well and I would get mouthfuls of some grit occasionally when I chewed.  I tried some of the 3 way chimichanga, which tasted decent, but it was hard to find the green chili part of the chimichanga.    Drinks were refilled promptly as needed, and service was generally good.",

I was even more pleased when our eager busboy, Pablo, was super helpful far above simple refills and cleanup.  He even picked up my heavy things and carried them to my car for me.

Hostess walked around quietly calling names, it was loud and you couldn't hear her, they need a new waiting system or a louder hostess  we missed our name completely.   Once seated waitress came over took drink order and disappeared.    20 mins later I asked a guy walking around.  He promptly got our drinks.    Waitress showed back up took our order.  30 mins later no food.     Flagged down another waiter he checked and brought our food.   Apparently the waitress quit or was fired mid shift and the manager did not jump in to help her tables.   Yes, things happen but the manager should have stepped up to be sure her tables were covered.   Food was good, service was a disappointment.     We were there over 2 hours for a simple 3 person dinner.",

    "text": "First. How many damn doors is there to enter into this place? I saw people standing at one side, I saw a couple more on the other side. But I was closer to another so went in there, praying the door was unlocked the whole time walking up. I stood there for a few minutes waiting to be seated. Well waiting, I noticed that it was different levels, not just one main floor. Bar was in the middle seperated. Seating was up and down for people who didn't want to sit on the bar. Good to know since my mom would have difficulty with any stairs.  Next to the bathroom there are those free nieghborhood weekly papers, so I grabbed some of those.  When the girl finally appeared and seated me chips and two salsa's showed up fairly quickly. The chunky salsa was too salty for me. And the smaller salsa was pretty good. By mixing both actually improved it.  I ordered the pollo fundido. My favorite part? The sides of cheese that were \"burnt\". Not sure if they threw the plate in the oven for awhile after palting it, but the crunchy part of the cheese was delicous, with the jalapeno cream cheese -yum! It was filled with chicken and not bad. You had the choice of black beans or refried with spanish rice. I got the refried since I already knew I was only going to eat a bite or two. The spanish rice had been sitting all day. You can tell because it was clumpy - yuck!  The waitor was attentive and courteous. The meal was about $13.00 bucks.",

I keep coming because I love their food \"most of the time\", but other times, not so much! It just depends on who's cooking! Today, I decided to order the poyo fondito(can't spell it) I took a bite and there was barely any cream cheese and hardly any shredded cheese melted on top and the chicken inside was very dry, so I asked the lady for more cream cheese & melted shredded cheese. She brought me back a bowel of orange marshmellowey looking stuff. At first I was like, eww gross, but then I tasted it and it was actually good. So I lathered up my burito and gained an extra 5 pounds, LMAO, Just kidding! Seriously though, it did take care of that dry chicken. So I guess you just gotta know how to fix your food when it doesn't taste right, right?",

Yes but it was VERY dark compared to not only the rest of the restaurant but even the area where we could sit and mingle. If they would have set this up in a different area, then I could easily give this a good solid 4 stars.. All in all great service considering it was a party of 60+.",

    "text": "I first went to Carlos O'Briens for a staff luncheon and actually found the food to be better than expected. Since then, it's become sort of a default choice whenever we're in no mood to take a risk on a new Mexican restaurant.  The layout of this place has always fascinated me, as I'm convinced that it wasn't a restaurant in its prior life. Perhaps a dance club of some kind, but all of the levels and separate rooms of this place just seem kind of strange, yet charmingly unique, even if the whole decor does seem very dated by today's standards. I asked a server once if he knew what was in the building before Carlos (if any), but he didn't seem to know.  Because of the various seating options, including large tables that accommodate big groups, this place seems to be a very popular spot for large family gatherings.  As for the food itself, I'm actually a big fan of their chimi con queso, recently finding that substituting the chicken out with shredded beef makes it even better. They also offer up some decent enchiladas. Chips and salsa are pretty standard, while their fried ice cream desert isn't the best we've had in compared to places like PoPo's.    Portions are very generous, food is pretty decent, and service has always been fast. They seem to run a much better operation over here in comparison to the location over on Scottsdale 101, but that's another story for another day. Overall, I don't really feel there's anything that Carlos does that's better or worse than its competitors.  Recommended as a mostly reliable Mexican restaurant on those nights when you can't come to a decision on anything else.",

Lo and behold we discovered plenty of menu options that met all of the needs of our party.  We arrived around 5 to beat the predicted dinner rush and were immediately seated. Loved the chips and salsas (chunky mild, hot-perfect complimentary flavors and textures).  I am fortunate to be free of special dietary needs this Christmas season as I make one last march up the hill before digging in for my next low carb restrictions for the next 10 1/2 months so I ordered the Number 9 (Burro, Taco, Tostada-burro..green chili...enchilada style (green) )  It was phenomenal.

Waitress was very short and snippy from the beginning. \"Sandy\", our waitress, didn't seem too happy, or maybe overwhelmed, even though it wasn't crowded.   Food came out and all was okay, except mine. Pollo Fundido is usually piping hot and delicious. But this time it was cold to the touch.   Sandy didn't come back until after we were finished to ask how things were and inquired why I didn't eat. I told her it was cold and she stated that I should have said something. When I told her she never came back, she said \"I've been here like 40 times!\"  Really.......not.    The drink and chip guy was good. He refilled the drinks and chips.  Sandy...nothing but a bad attitude.   After my complaining, She brought a free fried ice cream, but then brought the bill. $14.00 inedible Pollo fundido included. I asked for the manager and told them to keep the cold pollo fundido. Just take it off the bill. The manager took it off, without an apology.    I really hate complaining at restaurants and love giving a good tip for good food and service. I used to love this place.   Sandy never came back to pick up the bill.  We had to pay up front and again, the \"manager\", said he will work on the service.   Hopefully, just an off night. Hate to see this place go away. But, we won't be going back anytime soon.",

    "text": "Came with my Family to have dinner. As we walked in my husband and I were looking around on how different the inside was compared to the other locations in Avondale. Well we made our way to the hostess booth and 5 people were just standing there and we didn't get greeted by any of them! I looked at my husband and my oldest daughter, said to them as we were all confused by this. So I said... what do we do? go and sit ourselves? That's when my husband said can we go sit anywhere or do we get seated?!? And that's when one of the servers was like oh... Then grabbing the menu's and walking us to our table and told us that our waitress will be with us shortly. Well that never happened because our waitress was one of those 5 people in the entrance. And she never came to us at all to take our order or drink order. I would have given this place a 1 star!! But the manager Jose went and took it upon himself to take our order made it more better by making us feel welcome!! On top of that he brought the drinks and expedite our food out and that's why I gave it a 5 star! To top it off he gave us a free dessert fried ice cream with strawberries.... My daughter's loved that and it would be something we would order on our next visit. So we'll be back because of this man Jose! The staff needs to learn that they need to greet every customer that walks in those doors not just stand around talk to each other, don't get my wrong nothing bad with that but take notice of the people. Not just \"some\" that walk in. Again Thank you Jose!!",

They were obnoxious, yelling f bombs constantly. My friend's wife eventually became irritated with constant barrage of expletives. At this point, I asked them to kindly cut back on the f-bombs. You would have thought I insulted their mothers by their response. immediately, the 4 guys became belligerent and threatened to kick our asses. One guy even asked the waiter if he could beat me up. He said that he knew the owner and he could do whatever he wanted. At this point, we decided to leave with our meals unfinished. I didn't take my family out to fight with 4 drunks. I spoke to the manager. He did apologize, and admitted that they WERE REGULARS. Apparently, he did speak to them, as they were leaving while we paid our bill at the front register. The manager didn't offer to comp us anything for our troubles. At least it wasn't boring. If you like to fight with drunks, maybe they will be when you go!",

    "text": "I ripped Carlos a new taquito hole three winters ago, but today's experience was much improved, and I've never been so pleased to add an update.   The hostess led us towards an \"upstairs\"  booth, but quickly recognized that my elderly mom doesnt walk that well, and offered \"lower level\" seating instead.  We didnt take it, but I cant tell you what a good impression it makes when the first person who greets you \"gets it\". Someone who anticipates needs rather than waits for you to explain them.   Our server was good too. Pleasant, but not overly familiar or chatty, and absolutely efficient. No mistakes.     My favorite (and least expected) discovery was what I think they call a \"Healthy Menu\" or something.  Shrimp Macho (ok, stop laughing)  had six good sized shrimp,  shells removed, quite nicely seasoned and pretty well cooked.  It was $7.95 with standard mexican combo sides. I thought it was a very good value, and if the sides were better, an outstanding one.   Lunch for two, which includes a big basket of chips, was $20 before tip.  Why only three stars, when my apoplectic rant (see below) bestowed two? Well, the chips and salsa are pretty bad. The drinks come in those awful little plastic \"glasses\" that hide dirt and god knows what. The back of the booths provide zero back support. It's just not a five, or even four, star place.   But today's third star represents a wholesale change in at least one customer's opinion of Carlos.  It will probably never be my favorite spot, but I previously railed that no one here \"gave a shit.\"  That's obviously changed and is worthy of mention.",

The food is good (not incredible, but a solid good) with large portions (I never finishe a meal). Very American style rather than traditional food with the typical dishes - tacos, enchiladas, chimichangas, etc. They go heavy on the cheese - it doesn't bother me, but it has bothered folks I have gone with. Otherwise, it is good food I am glad to eat.   The service was incredibly fast. Tonight, a Friday evening, they were packed, yet we ordered, ate and chatted, and were out the door in less than 40 minutes. Staffers were there whenever my glass was low, but weren't in our faces all the time.   The prices are medium - you're looking at $10-20 per person depending on what you order.    The restaurant itself is pretty decent. The decor is pretty American Mexi-style, with obligatory bright colors and wood furniture. It's not a quiet place, but it isn't real loud - just active.   Short story is, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but am perfectly happy to stop in.",

Between us, we ate three bites of it and put it aside.  My husband's dinner, Pollo Fundido, was not any better.  The pollo fundido was over salted and made with poor quality ingredients; the chicken appeared to have come from a can versus fresh, and the cheese tasted processed versus real.

So today, in desperate need of a margarita, I decided to stop here with a couple of friends for a pitcher and some guacamole. After a few margaritas, I found their \"healthy\" menu and decided to order their  \"vegan\" veggie burrito. Problem was there was nothing vegan about it. After several bites of the burrito, I found a large piece of burnt steak inside. NASTY! If that wasn't enough, after consuming nearly half of the black beans it was served with, I found pieces of pork in the beans. That explains why they were so salty. I presented all of this to the manager who was kind enough to take most of everything, minus the booze, off of the bill. Revolting.",

Then my brother got the skirt steak plate..forgot the actual name of the plate. And i got the sampler platter which had tacos, chiminchanga, enchiladas, rice and beans. Our reaction to my plate and the nachos was \"oh my gosh, what the heck did we order\".   To start, the nachos were soo smothered with cheese we ended up draining all the cheese grease into another plate. NASTY!! We only ate a few and just couldn't stand it anymore. And my sampler plate was just the same, everything and i mean EVERYTHING was covered up with cheese. The skirt steak plate was the only thing that was good. We didn't even eat a fourth of all the food and just couldn't take it anymore. Each bite of the smothered cheesy food was like taking a year off your life.   I mean, this place was so highly recommended we couldn't believe the food we got. I will never come here again. And will tell others not to come. The bill for two people was over $40...what!?!?  I am too use to the Mexican food in LA, cheap and good with flavor!",

Started off good enough with a round of drinks and chips and salsa at the bar. Both were good and reasonably priced. I thought the hot sauce was quite good with a good bite to it. Bartender/s were friendly and attentive. Were seated for dinner by friendly staff. Menu was also reasonably priced, if only it was tasty. I had the Grande Burro. Huge but bad. The chicken was old (tough and stringy). The mixture of ingredients were indistinguishable. I bit into something hard that was marble sized and burnt to a crisp. No idea what it was as I spit it out. Picked through the rest of the burro but ate little more. My wife had the number 1 combo. The cheese enchilada was good but the shredded beef taco was not. The beans were flavorless and the rice was not touched. The other coupled ordered a green chili con carne burrito which was \"OK\" but the wife's number 2 combo went pretty much untouched. I belched all night and both the wife and I woke up with upset stomachs this morning (btw neither of us have overly sensitive stomachs and enjoy spicy foods). I'm embarrassed I recommended this restaurant to my friends. Carlos O'Brien's is off the list.",

We both love Mexican food and Carlos O'Brien's is literally within walking distance from my house. We used to go all the time as kids, but it has been years since I have been there last.   I'm glad we gave it a try because we had a really great experience. We were seated immediately even though it was 5:45pm. We had friendly, attentive service from both our busser and our server.  We were served delicious, warm tortilla chips shortly after sitting with a tasty, fresh, and chunky salsa. They also provided the liquefied hot sauce, but I did not eat it because I do not like that kind at any restaurant.  I decided on the veggie fajitas. The black beans are vegetarian, the refrieds are not. My sister selected the fajita quesedilla, sans meat.  Our food arrived quickly and piping hot. Both of us had huge portion sizes and the food was extremely fresh and really tasty. They put a salty and slightly spicy seasoning on their fajitas, which come with a mixture of peppers, onions, squash, zucchini and potatoes.   Back in the day when I used to eat meat (15+ years ago) I always ordered the shredded beef chimi. It was amazing. I would assume that it retains the same amazing taste and size as when I favored it as a child, but who knows.  Our meal came to $21 and I gladly tipped our server over 20%! I will definitely be back when I have a cheat day on my diet!!",

I think the problem is that some people have unreasonable expectations, especially after having visited for myself. The food was pretty good, the portions were unusually large and the service was far above average. This is not the best Mexican food I have ever had, but nobody at my table had anything but positive to say about their menu choices. My daughter in particular had an adult-size meal that she ordered from the kids menu. I tried it. It was almost as good as my carnitas chimichanga. I hope that people wait til they are in a better mood before they write their reviews. When a place truly sucks then I could see, but this place doesn't.",

Did you pick up on the subtle hint that this may not be the place for those who are looking for something special when they want to have Mexican food?  I hope (lol).  I debated on two or three stars.  I wouldn't go back there myself-two stars.  If I had a family to feed or people from out of town who don't need to be impressed-three stars.

Proximity might have a lot to do with it, but I really appreciated the food. The portions were plentiful, the food was top notch and spicy, but the service really needed to improve.

Stopped by to grab a late dinner only to be left with an unpleasant experience and a promise it was the last time we would be stopping in.  After getting seated at a dirty table, it took about 10 min for the server to come and attend to us. In the mean while, we found napkins to wipe down the  dirty tables. After the bus boys brought us the water, we then had to find straws. We placed our order and surprisingly our food came out pretty quick. Umm yeah that was probably the first indication that we where heading down hill from here.  Our table ordered the green corn Tamale, chicken fundido ,  enchilada/taco combo plate and chicken fajitas. ALL was TERRIBLE! The worst was the Fajitas which were bland. Anyways NEVER did the waitress came by to ask if we needed anything and when we finally tracked her down to get a sauce of some sort to sauce to put on the fajitas to make them eatable, rather than ask if we would like something else she brought us enchilada sauce with an attitude. Needless to say, they where still terrible. NOT edible. after hunting her down again, we asked for our check as we couldn't eat the terrible food or deal with the the horrible service. Of course another 10 MIN went by before she brought us the check. Then after we clearly let her know the food was not edible, she sees the plates where full, she hands us a $75 bill. Lol when I told her she needed to remove the fajitas as that was a complete plate that couldn't be eaten she again with an attitude was gone for a while before bringing us the revised check. We will never return to a Carlos Obrien restaurant after experiencing the worst service and terrible food!",

My wife's fish taco fell apart and she couldn't even eat it, because the tortilla was soggy.   My kids had French fries delivered to them late, so they were upset they had to 10 long minutes just to get fries after our food was delivered.   My fajitas were delicious, and my mother had the the chimichanga. We enjoyed our food, but we wouldn't return and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.   Also, bill was extremely high for 5 people, 2 of which ordered french fries only. Two thumbs down",

It has been many years since I was here and will probably not be back as there are so many other better options. It is possible we caught them on an off night as the place was mostly full.

As you're sitting at a table, look up at all the dust and dirt hanging from the ceiling and things hanging from the ceiling.  It's time to close the place for a couple of days and give it a good cleaning.  The service is usually okay and the food is pretty good.  I just feel if the owners don't care about dirt and dust falling on you and in your food, what else don't they care about that we can't see. We won't be going back until they clean the place.",

    "text": "Today we ate at the restaurant with my wife and daughter. The restaurant was not busy and we were seated right away. The waitress took our order and did not understand us. We repeated the order and she left. About 15 minutes passed abs she came back and asked us for our order again. We have it to her and she left. Another 20 minutes passed and she showed up with our food. It was cold and she left it on the table. She brought us the wrong drinks as well. Maybe this is a new waitress? She did not ask us if all was ok. We quickly realized the food was cold. It was not a good night. I contacted the manger who at first offered 50% off. I told the manager this was a real bad situation all around and felt bad for the waitress she really was confused and appeared to be upset with the mistakes made. The manger then offered to Comp the meals and drinks. That was good customer service to fix the issue. We never have a problem here and this was the first time this happened. Overall the service was poor, food cold and very disappointed",

    "text": "I haven't eaten at Carlos O'Brien's in a couple decades. I remember LOVING Carlos O'Brien's!! I will say it is similar, but it was disappointing from what I remember. The WORST part was our barely there waitress!! She didn't even clear off plates when dropping off the check OR when she returned with our check after processing it!!! She left us there with dirty plates and napkins all over the table while we stayed for a bit visiting with someone we have not seen for a year (we wanted to visit for a bit...it wasn't busy as we arrived about 2:00 in the afternoon)!!  My shredded beef taco was just as I remembered:  Large, tasty and with lots of cheese!! My red enchilada literally had ONLY a tablespoon of red sauce!! Our waitress was Missing In Action, so I left the enchilada for last and asked for some sauce to-go when she dropped off the check. When I got some sauce, I poured some on and tasted the enchilada. The CHEESE was NOT what I remember. It was more like an imitation cheese, not a good quality cheese.   My hubby ordered a chicken burrito and it was HUGE. He reported it was basically \"tasteless\" and that it simply was nothing but shredded chicken. No seasoning, no chili's, no tomato, no onion, no sauce.   Overall, we liked the tacos, the tostada, the rice, the beans, the chips, the salsa and hot sauce. We did not like the burritos or enchiladas. We likely will go back on occasion to meet up with our friend who has moved to this area, but will not order the same items.  Three stars as the food was just average with BAD service!!",

I can see this place getting crazy busy other nights, but right now (Tues 8:30pm) it's pretty chill. There's a nice crowd, spread out. Tv's are on and not loud; always annoying when TVs and music are blasting in a place where you just wanna relax. I got complimentary chips and salsa, pretty darn good. Since my roots stem south of the border, I tend to judge things like chips and salsa, rice and beans, tortillas, etc... lol. Why? Cuz I can! I kid... Moving on, their salsas are stupendous! Wait, did I just say stupendous? I did because they're both really good! Bartender is muy bueno and I have decided that I like this place. Plan to come back and try some of their food.",

She had a pork burrito which she gave a 4 star to.  I had a pollo fundido  which was good and certainly had a LOT of chicken in it.

    "text": "I want to like Carlos O'Brien's. Because it's basically within walking distance of my house. I really do want to like it. Unfortunately, I don't. Don't get me wrong, everything I've had here is passable, but nothing really shines.  First off, the name. Carlos (Latin) O'Brien's (Irish). In the spirit of, say, Chino Bandido's, I think it's reasonable to expect that the food at O'Brien's should have a Latin-Irish mashup. Spicy Irish classics? That could be cool! But no, they don't do this. As a matter of fact, the place might as well be called Carlos Martinez' - because there's nothing on the menu at all even remotely Irish. This is a straight-up \"Mexican\" sit-down restaurant experience that seems to be trying to emulate Macayo's.  And this is why they fail. While their food is as palatable as Macayo's in many respects, none of its acoutrements (those things that take Macayo's to another level) are polished enough to service what is, in the end, bland Ameri-Mexican food. Chimichangas? Check. Mini-version-of-everything appetizer plate? Check. But their taco meat tastes almost like straight beef, their rice and beans sucks, their salsa is bland and boring, their guacamole is tasteless (and expensive) and their sour cream is weirdly salty. Their salads are uninteresting afterthoughts. I dream about Macayo's' Fiesta Salad - the salads here all taste like Denny's salads put in a tortilla bowl.  In short, if you want some unique Mexican food, go local. Go authentic. Even if you're looking for something to satisfy your American craving for strip-mall chain-food Mexican, you can do better than this.",

It's a great place to meet and eat - they have a huge restaurant with plenty of seating. The food alone is a reason to go, but the staff is always friendly and the service is very quick. My favorite dish is the CHICKEN FONDIDO! If you like fried chicken, cheese and cream cheese THEN LOOK NO FURTHER because the Chicken Fondido is the end-all be-all of amazingness! Granted that the food is not authentic Mexican, it is very interesting to combine Mexican and Irish food. Coming from a Spanish and Irish family, I felt quite at home looking at the menu and having to choose between corned beef and nachos. And it gets even better when you consider the prices. For the over-the-top portions you receive, the prices are very agreeable.  The atmosphere is clean, friendly and inviting. If you're on a date you can ask for a more intimate table and they will be happy to seat you somewhere you can kanoodle with your date. Drinks from the bar are prompt and put together correctly. Never once have I had to send something back to be remade - even when I've ordered complicated mixed drinks. A couple can go and have dinner, drinks and dessert for under $30. I really, really enjoy this place and highly recommend it to everyone: single people, couples, families and friends!",

Plus they have a bunch of happy hour meals for $5. Their regular menu has decent prices as well. We typically sit up at the bar which is open seating and we are served immediately.   The staff is great, always so friendly and attentive.  We have never had a bad experience or bad food here.  Great place! Keep it up!",

    "text": "First off lets get the Mexican food subject tackled. There are a few types: Senoran New Mexico Mexico City Tex Mex Fresh Mex(BLARF!)  I am an Arizona boy. I grew up eating americano senoran Mexican food. There is ABSOLUTELY nothing wrong with loving it. Is it real \"Mexican food\" who's to say. Do I appreciate other styles of Mexican food? Hell yes I do! Tex and Fresh being the lest of my favorites.  When I got to Mexico I don't go looking for a cheese crisp and a shredded beef taco. I go looking for hangover cure menudo. I go looking for brain exploding chicken mole. I celebrate Mexican food in all of its delicious forms!  So now that we have that out of the way.  Carlos O'Briens... This is a perfect example of americano senoran style Mexican food. I love this stuff.. I crave this stuff.. I have a Mexican food fuel gauge that must be filled when it hits empty.  You cannot go wrong with the classics here.  Cheese Crisp: One of the best in town.  Guacamole: This is what quac should be. Its not 50% tomatoes. Its pretty much avocado, lime, salt, garlic, cilantro, some chilies. It is amazing and I feel is only topped by what I make at home which is the same style.  Shredded Beef Taco: Again how it should be. The beef is stuffed into the taco THEN deep fried so you get those delicious crispy fried beefs ends in the taco. It is then piled with delicious Mexican cheese blend.. real cheese..  Red Enchilada Sauce: This stuff is great.. Your enchilada will come swiming in it again covered in cheese which is salamandered. When that cheese grease mates with the enchilada sauce.. Mmmmmm happy place.  Rolled Tacos: Both the beef and chicken are good.. Again filled then deep fried and covered in a huge glob of quac and cheese.  Favorite Meal: #1 Combo (comes on two plates because its thats big!) Shredded Beef Taco, Cheese Enchilada, Rice, Beans Cheese Crisp with guacamole. Ask for it WITH guacamole. You will get WAY more on it then if you order a side and its actually cheaper. If its to much scoop it onto a plate and enjoy it on some chips.  Bottom Line...  You will leave without a gaping hole in your wallet. You will leave with a very full stomach. The service will be acceptable. You will be happy. They also have great lunch specials here. They raised them a bit but its still a good deal.  Also.. do yourself a favor and stick to the northern location. The owner pretty much lives there and the quality is just better. When he isn't there they have a very trusted manager who has also been there forever and takes great care of the place.",

The crispy outside and packed with goodness inside was just wonderful. The downfall is the portion size is enough to feed two people....so you will need to take the rest home..or share. :)",

    "text": "My friend introduced this place to me.  The service is hit and miss though.  This place is super casual family restaurant and but of course there is a bar side with tv screens for the customers that want to get liquored up with their chips and salsa. What I usually order is off their \"healthy selections\" menu which is kinda nuts since I usually order the chili con queso dip as an appetizer.  It's super fattening.  I feel guilty even ordering it but it's so good.  The healthy dish i usually get is the poquito carne asada w/ brown rice and wheat tortilla.  But who am i kidding?  i always have to have the chips and salsa and hot sauce.  Love their hot sauce.  Sometimes I order the queso fondido which i refer to as the \"heart attack on a plate\" because it's a deepfried chicken chimichanga smothered with cream cheese and then melted jack and cheaddar cheese on top of that.  Can you say heart attack?  It's really yummy but not so great for you.  I've also had the fried ice cream there too and it's hit and miss.  sometimes it turns out good and sometimes it's kinda soupy which is not so good.",

    "text": "Absolutely terrible service! Walked in with 6 other family members. Waited at the door for 10 min. No one greeted us. Had to go find someone to figure out whether to seat ourselves or if we needed wait to be seated. I finally found someone and he said oh you guys can go just sit at the bar. I informed him that we had a party of seven and he said \"OK you guys can just sit at the bar.\" I again informed him that we did not want to sit at the bar that we wanted to be seated in the restaurant area and he said OK just wait and someone will be right with you. After about five more minutes of waiting we were finally seated.  We were seated and at the table we were only given 4 menus for seven people, so I had to go and ask for more menus so we could all figure out what we wanted to eat and drink. The waitress that we were given was absolutely terrible. No smile, flat affect, and monotone. She had a terrible attitude and was pissy the entire time. While taking drink orders, she was rude to my uncle because he asked what size is the margaritas came in. She did not specify that they came in different sizes when he ordered. Normally if a drink comes in different sizes, your waiter/waitress will ask you what size you would like. When he asked what size he ordered she told him that he ordered the smallest one and he informed her that he was not aware that there were different sizes and her response was \"well that's What you ordered.\" At that point I was done.   I see a staff member walking around with a dress shirt. I get up from the table and ask him if I can change servers. He politely said yes absolutely. May I ask why? I proceed to inform his of what happened. He politely apologized and walked me back to my table. He asked another server to attend to us. He was ok but he seemed so overwhelmed because he had other tables. He's was nice and took care of us.   Food was ok. The meals are huge I will admit that. One of my uncles ordered chicken wings and they are served naked. By naked I mean not tossed in any sauce which I found was odd. My aunt ordered flautas and they were supposed to be flour tortillas and they made them with corn. My other uncle ordered the fish tacos and he stated that he enjoyed them. Margaritas were tasty. Micheladas are mediocre.   I'm totally disappointed with this place. The service and food quality has gone down so much it's a disappointment. I Brought my family here for and amazing meal and great atmosphere. Instead I got nothing but embarrassment. Would never bring my family back again.",

We were immediately sat at a booth and our server came over a few minutes later to say water and chips were on their way to the table but did we have a drink order? We both got a glass of wine and then studied the menu. It was a big menu. Lots of delicious looking traditional Mexican items like burritos and tacos and chimichangas but also some American food of hamburgers and fries. A nice kids menu (we don't have small children any more but there were chicken fingers on it and some other items). She brought us our drinks, we weren't ready yet to order. She did come back attentively a few minutes later and asked if we had any questions on the menu. By then we were ready to order. I got the ala carte burrito, shredded beef, dry (no sauce). Hubby got the shredded beef chimichanga that came with green sauce on it (delicious, not too spicy) and rice and beans. The food was there I think within 5 minutes. We were still enjoying the very generous serving of complimentary chips and dip and our food arrived steaming hot and very good! Our server checked in on us a couple of times and we did order another glass of wine each (I think she may have mixed up our wines as we got 2 different kinds) but after a few sips we realized it and switched them ourselves. Restaurant is big! Bar on one side, tables on the other side. Very clean. Very friend. Very delicious. We'll be back!",

I have had better salsa however, my lunch companion thought the salsa was good.  I ordered the chicken fundido as did my lunch companion. In what seemed like an impossibly short time our orders were placed in front of us. I have to say that the entrees served at Carlos O'briens are of very generous portions.  In fact,  there was enough there for two to share.  You definitely get your money's worth.  However, I really didn't care for the taste of the chicken fundido.  The chicken was very dry and the sauce didn't have much flavor. I guess this restraunt just isn't for me.  On a positive note our server, was very attentive and wanted to make sure everything was to our liking.   .",

But for me, the food was really lacking. I ordered a taco and a cheese enchilada to try things out. I loved the fresh-made taco shell, but I wasn't expecting barbacoa - I was hoping for just regular 'ole ground beef (I know, boring, right? but when ground beef tacos are done right, it's the best thing ever. See my review for Sadie's in Albuquerque, NM. Best. Taco. Ever.) Anyway, my server graciously offered to replace my taco with a ground beef taco and when it arrived it had a store-bought taco shell. Huh? Why is the beef taco with the homemade shell but the ground beef taco with the fake one?  It is a casual and homey atmosphere and probably has something for everyone here. If I return I might have to order differently and see how it goes.",

I walked in to see it was rundown with dirty booths, I still eat there because I had faith- to start the chips were flavorless, but the salsa was great. I ordered a chicken chimichanga-okay . Jeff, don't be cheap refurbished that restaurant-gross. Sadly, I will not be back. Because there is better Mexican food in the Valley of the Sun.",

The food was average, it wasn't bad but it was just like what you would have at a Garcias chain or similar. The chips and salsa are good. I got the pollo fundido and the chicken was a little dry but the cream on it was really good. The service was overall good but I could tell that they aren't used to having kids in the establishment. We don't usually take our child to high end, adult oriented restaurants but this restaurant definitely doesn't fit that criteria (we went during the day too.) so it surprised it us that we caught that vibe.",

I personally like one or the other.  Anyhow, the food was alright. I had an enchilada. I enjoyed my drink. Couple across from me had it in a pitcher, so I would have liked to know that was possible before I ordered it or asked as an upsell. Totally would have gone for it! Seating was very open, but it was pretty dead. I walked from the board game store over and the location is not the greatest/safest feeling and the crowd inside matched that. Definitely adequate parking though. To recommend this place, I would bring more people because it just felt so empty with the number of rooms, booths that were curved to fit family style eating, etc.",

My son's cup looked dirty. The salsas, one was very tomato tasting and the other one had a little kick, but it tasted weird. The chips were good. I believed I had the chicken fundido?? Anyway, it was a big portion, but I felt like it was just too much chicken in it and it was kind of dry. I wouldn't come to the place again because the place is pretty old and run down. I think it smells funny and the food is not that great. It does get one start because the people that worked there were nice.",

    "text": "Just like the Veggie Fajitas they served my mama - this place lacked sizzle.  My mom has been raving and singing the praises of Carlos O'briens for sometime now and not wanting to miss out on somewhere good, she took me there last night.   When we got in the parking lot, and saw the look of the huge rock mountain of stone - I KNEW something was a miss... why are mountainous structures in Phoenix always home to great salsa and bland food? WHY?!  We entered and were seated right away in a HUGE dining area \"upstairs\" that was way cute back in 1990 when it was last redecorated - but this isn't 1990 and it's - kitchy. After I sat down and saw the plain looking laminated menu, I realized that my mom and I were the ONLY brown people in the building besides a bus boy who looked afraid of his own shadow! Red Flag #3!!  Our waiter Nathan introduced himself and seemed really nice as he brought our chips and salsa and took our drink order. We also ordered our food - I had the #13 - A Little Bit of Everything and my mom had the Veggie Fajitas. I must say that the menu is very uninspired and I wished to see some house specialties or innovation... inspiration and innovation are luxaries that Carlos O'brien can't afford.   Whie our food was being prepared, we enjoyed our chips and salsa which was VERY good, I must say! I SWEAR I've had their salsa before, I just can't place it! But it's still good and worth the trip alone. Our food came quickly and we were disappointed by the fact that my mom's fajitas lacked any soul, had some spice and weren't sizzling off the iron. Boo! She loved that her fajitas had ingredients not normally seen in fajitas, such as potatos and zucchini.   My plate was a big glob of gooey cheese! The guac on the chicken flautas were good however the flautas were a little over cooked. The Chimis were very good and I loved their cream cheesy sour cream type sauce - I just they didn't give me so much of it! I was scraping it off after my first bite. With a good chili kick and plenty of salt, my Green Corn tamales were DEFINATLY the best part of my meal!   And the toastada, rice and especially the beans were the lowlight of my meal. I never had a worse toastada, I don't even know how to you screw up a toastada - but leave it up to Carlos to figure it out. The rice tasted old and were dry. The beans also tasted old and had too much cheese, there was so much cheese that my lil bowl of beans was practically glued to my plate! GROSS!   We were still happy and eating away and I didn't think we were taking too long when Nathan our waiter gave us the bum's rush! He put down our check andd Offered to bring us to-go boxes when we were still happily eating and showed no signs of slowing down. I was like - there are FOUR tables seat in a 30+ table facility - there's NO ONE at the door, even then - you got the room!! Why are you rushing us out?! We requested two to-go boxes and when he returned with them he seemed disappointed in the fact that we hadden't paid yet. My mom quickly dropped her debt card and I was annoyed.  We did need to get going - we had another errand to run before heading home but still. The polite thing to do would have been to leave our check and tell us to take our time, replenish our drinks and WAIT for us to ask for a box. GEEZ! Some people's children!  To my fellow yelpers, if you want fresh, sizziling sexy Mexican food - avoid this place like the plauge. If you want to appease out-of-town relatives with sensitive palates to a nice Arizona Mexican dinner - this is the place for you! Have the green tamales and enjoy the chips with salsa, they're both quite good.",

    "text": "Disappointing. 50% of the experience is the interaction with the server, and this guy was terrible. We ordered a Happy Hour Cheese Crisp to start and then I ordered a Green Corn Tamale \"a la carte\".  My husband ordered a monster beef burrito called the Grande Burrito. Our lil cheese crisp came out quite some time after ordering, and then so did our dinners (within 3 minutes of each other). The other server in the bar delivered our food and offered more salsa and chips (our server was not attentive, didn't notice/didn't bother). I told my husband that the green Corn Tamale was not my favorite...didn't taste much like a Tamale. Come to find out that's because the server put in my order as a Tamale \"enchilada\" style...not what I ordered. We only figured this out after I pointed out two discrepancies on our bill. Irritated. The server argued with me and said the Tamale was only $5.95 on their \"lunch\" menu - we were given our menus by the hostess and it was not a lunch menu. He didn't know what he was talking about. I told him the cheese crisp was supposed to be $3.95 not $5.95 (dinky, worth $3.95) so he fixed that after 5 minutes but didn't fix the Tamale stating that was the lunch price only. I don't get rattled easily, but this guy gave bad service and now he is arguing. The manager comes by to tell me that I ordered it Enchilada style so that's why it was $7.95 instead of the menu a la carte price of $5.95. Weird because I DIDN'T FREAKING ORDER IT ENCHILADA STYLE!!! No wonder I didn't like it - I thought they just made a crummy Tamale but now I understand why it had sauce on top. The manager set $2 on our table and apologized for any misunderstanding. Too late - your server (and Tamale) left an impression that would not bring us back to your location.  Good News: Bartender with grey hair and ponytail actually knew what he was doing. Personable; too bad we didn't get him. Beer was good and husband liked the Grande Burrito that he should get 2 more meals out of.",

Dave took my order and was very thorough to ensure I understood exactly what was included and how it would be delivered. He called on the day to confirm details and arrived right on time. I couldn't have asked for better service.    The food was good, too. We had mini tacos, flautas, plus green corn tamales and pollo fundido. Everything was hot, flavorful. Came with generous amounts of chips, salsa, rice and beans. I ordered black beans instead of refried and they were awesome, too! I ordered a bit extra and my family loved taking home some leftovers.    I considered a couple of different options for Mexican food catering and prices were pretty comparable. So glad I chose Carlos, as the food and service were terrific.  Dinner was just as good as when we visit the restaurant -- YUM!",

They have some decent lunch options. The chips and salsa are better than some other places. For lunch, ordered the beef chimichanga and instead of the usual red sauce, it was covered in green sauce which was tasty and different. It was a large portion with the beans and rice and I ended up taking half of it home. Overall, I remember it being better, but will probably return again.",

    "text": "Maybe we went on a \"bad\" day for the restaurant, but this particular Carlos O'Brien's left MUCH to be desired in the way of both food quality and friendly service. I've eaten at the Avondale location and left there very impressed, so I was expecting a similar experience at this Northern Ave restaurant. Sadly, this was definitely not the case.  I ordered shredded beef tacos with a side of beans because I like the result when the taco spills over onto the beans - it makes the beans especially tasty. However, someone needs to teach the cook how to make authentic Mexican refried beans because these were shameful. First of all, they were red; not brown, but red. Not sure what they put in them to make them red (I was afraid to ask), but it looked as if they may have added red chili sauce or some type of red sauce to turn them that color. Whatever it was, it didn't enhance or noticeably change the flavor to something favorable. Plus, when the waitress brought the plate to our table, the beans appeared to have a dried, crust-like surface and rounded edges, kind of resembling a pancake...only red...with a tiny bit of semi-melted cheese on top. I've had WAY better refried beans from some of the drive-thru places in the area. In fact, I don't think I've ever had worse refried beans anywhere. These were not like the refried beans I had at the Avondale location.  On a positive note, the tacos were very good once I added a mixture of salsas and pico de gallo. Salsa and pico de gallo are what make or break my dining experience at a Mexican restaurant, and I found the hotter version of the salsa to be the most flavorful at Carlos O'Brien's. Someone needs to also teach the cook how to make pico de gallo that has flavor; but, as a tomato and onion garnish, it passed. The salsa in general needs more garlic and cilantro, in my opinion.  So, will I be going back to this location of Carlos O'Brien's? Not a chance. It just wasn't that good, nor was the service very friendly. Maybe our waitress was tired...who knows...or cares, as I'll be enjoying my Mexican food elsewhere in the future.",

    "text": "I love this place! The service is usually on point, though drink refills can be a bit scarce. I love the chips and salsa. They have the fresh fried thin crispy chips that most places don't serve. The salsa is fresh and loaded with flavor. It lacks a bit in the spice department, however they give a small secondary bowl of hotter salsa that had a smoky chipotle kick. As I have said before I am a bit of a one dish wonder, however since my favorite dish here is actually an appetizer I have branched out and explored the menu a bit. First off if you hit up happy hour, get the guacamole. At $5 and change it's worth it. If it's not happy hour, I wouldn't bother it's not $8 guacamole. The first thing I order, after my margarita is the Shredded Beef Bontonas. I order them without olives because they come with giant whole olives and they are hot from the melting process. Not something I'm interested in eating, but it's up to you. I also always order with extra cheese. I'm an addict and just watching the cheese stretch between my chip and the plate warms the small glutinous cockles of my heart. The blending of the green bontana sauce and the tender shredded beef is over the top. It's full flavored, but not spicy. If anything I would like the spice level kicked up a notch. If I'm planing on ordering another item from the menu, I opt for a half order (unless you are eating alone, you are going to have to decide whether you are going to fend off the vultures with the pointy end of your fork, or let the scavengers descend) The small order is plenty to share, and as a meal is also quite generous. I am just one of those girls who takes eating seriously and I can put away some nachos. Other items on the menu I have tried are the beans (standard), the fajitas (standard and as with most places the price is disproportionate to the actual amount of meat provided) I am a sucker for enchiladas, and these are definitely an item I order quite frequently. I do have gluten issues, so burritos, chimichangas and floutas are not something I will ever order.",

    "text": "I ate dinner here last night. It wasn't as good as my last visit.   I ordered a shrimp enchilada house special with a beef taco ala carte and a grande margarita.  The server was ok no complaints there, but the food just didn't taste all that great.   The shrimp enchilada was advertised as coming with a jalapeno cream sauce. It wasn't much of a sauce, more like a big glob of sour cream with some jalapeno mixed in. The result was that it made the enchilada taste cold. The rice and refried beans were at best average. The beef taco was alright, but I've had much better. The last time I went here a few months ago, on a slow night, it seemed better. But this visit on a Friday night, the food wasn't that appetizing.  I don't think I will go back to Carlos O'Brien's.",

I've only ever had one issue with them when I went one time but I believe it was because the server was new (most the staff has been there for years)  Great family restaurant, and if you want you can order in advance and just pick up your food to take home.  Every time we have done this (maybe 5 times recently upon discovering you could) our orders are always right, and they always give you extra chips and yummy salsa!",

Then we got dinner he got the Rueben which was really soggy and soup like over spicy slaw, the meat was way over cooked and the fries were not Cooked well enough at all. I got the #13 and everything was really dry and tasted like crap. We ate over all probably  like a few bites of each thing. It was not good and we will never go back. Taco bell would of been a better choice",

    "text": "It had been years since I had been to Carlos O'Briens and last night was a reminder why it had been so long. The wait was short..we were seated right away and before we even settled into the booth we had our water with our chips and salsa. The waitress was pleasant and refilled our beverages, the restrooms clean.   So why do you say, \"Only 2 stars?\" The food..where to begin about the food. Our meal started on such a high note, the chips were hot and the salsa fresh..that is where the high notes end. My pollo fundido was extremely dry with chicken that tasted like it had been boiled with absolutely no seasoning..no salt, no pepper..nothing. The jalapeno cream sauce was good and the dish had plenty of melted cheese, but all of that unseasoned chicken just made it so very unappealing. The beans  had a good flavor but they looked like they had been under a heat lamp for a while, all of that gooey melted cheese couldn't hide the hard, dry crust that had formed on top. And the rice....I will just leave it at that, rice  The husband had a shredded beef enchilada & taco combo. He ate the enchilada, said it was ok, but the taco..again, boiled, unseasoned meat, which he left on the plate. The child had a grilled cheese sandwich. Really over toasted bread with unmelted cheese, how can you mess up a 4 year olds grilled cheese?   Carlos O'Brien has the potential to be a great mexican restaurant. It's affordable, the restaurant is clean and they are in an area with not a whole lot of dining options (maybe that is why they have been a round for so long) but unless they take a little more pride in the actual food..I don't think in this econony they might not make it.",
