    "text": "Came here this evening -- 2nd day open. It's been a long time coming since I actually live in the apartments adjacent to MATCH and the new FOUND:RE hotel. It was a long year of wondering what was going to come of all this construction happening and I have to say that MATCH cuisine is a perfect addition to the Roosevelt neighborhood and arts district. You walk in to eccentric detail and I hear they have an art curator on staff so the contemporary art vibe definitely surrounds you. We walked in through the lobby of the hotel invited by a piece of a naked Burt Reynolds but I'm not mad about that lol. There was plenty of staff around to guide us to the restaurant entrance and hostess table. It wasn't busy for a Thursday evening so we were seated immediately.   There is an open kitchen on the perimeter of the restaurant and I absolutely love that -- I have a thing for open kitchens. Our waitress greeted us and filled our water cups promptly. We were told of the specials and then faced the difficult decision of what to choose from the menu. My husband, mom and I pretty much each chose one thing from each section of the menu and here was the breakdown:   The Coctel de Camron came out first which was basically a shrimp cocktail dish. Doused in a flavorful sauce with avocado and heirloom tomatoes... mmm!!  From the wood fire pizzas/salad: Burrueta pizza which featured Filipino longanisa. Being Filipino, we had to try it. And it did not disappoint... except for the size. It was on the smaller side-- we devoured it and I wanted more!   Big plates: homemade gnocchi with meatballs. Boy, do I love gnocchi so this one was easily a must-have for me. The meatballs were generous size, tasty, and moist! The gnocchi was perfect and buttery and it all sat in a yummy tomato sauce. I think I'm going to have to have gnocchi every time I come here because it's also in their lobster bisque and it comes as a side as well. Do try it, trust me!!   Our evening ended with a bang -- the chef's table dessert prepared right in front of us by the pastry chef on a silicone mat that we were to eat right off of!! Such an amazing treat! I saw it being presented to another table so (and being pregnant) I HAD TO have it. I asked so many questions as this was being done and was mesmerized by the technique and different components but here's what I remember: ganache, soft almond crumble, dark chocolate soil, chocolate mousse, shortbread cookies, dulce de leche sauce, coconut cream sauce, locally made Scooptacular coconut ice cream (which I am a HUGE fan of!)... (see my photo of it!) do yourself a favor if you're celebrating or just want to treat yourself, DO THIS! You'll thank me later.   I can't say enough great things about this place and it was only our first time for dinner. This first impression was everything: to the inviting decor, friendly staff and excellent chefs, and most importantly, the food. I can't hardly wait to come back for breakfast and lunch because I heard those menus were even better. Let's just say I am so glad to live in the neighborhood. Downtown Phoenix has a new gem in town.",

    "text": "Celebrated a birthday here (just 2 of us), and they really went out of their way to make it special for us (thank you, Julie!). The GM even personally spoke with me about my plans, which was SUCH a nice gesture; they REALLY want everyone to have a great experience! WHAT SERVICE!! 5-Star in my book (felt like a fine-dining, but without the pretense). Our server, Fernando, was on top of things at all times. One reviewer said MATCH reminded him of a downtown Chicago restaurant, and I concur! I have been a Phoenician way too long, but honestly felt like I was in another city - practically 180 views of trendy Portland Street Park. Didn't experience any noise problems when there. The cocktails are TDF (To Die For): We had The Aviation, a Match Margarita, and a Sloe Gin drink that were all strong and (after trading sips) were absolutely delicious! Bar staff are very friendly and the Happy Hour prices are a steal! The food was excellent: fresh flavors, well-seasoned, and cooked to perfection. Not fond of meatballs usually, but their meatball appetizer tasted so uniquely great, they made me a fan (at least of theirs). Besides the meatballs, the truffle fries were ample and very crispy. Had the Sea Bass and the Grilled Shrimp (HUGE!) - both cooked perfectly, served with the yummy sauces recommended by our server (now want to try the others!). Price-wise: not cheap, but comparable to other places nearby (and definitely less expensive than many Scottsdale restaurants in the same \"tier\".) Also had breakfast there, and was surprised how affordable the breakfast was for what you got. MUCH less expensive and better quality than anywhere I am aware of. And yes, very tasty and fresh, too! I'll leave you with is: Save room for dessert! Hint: Date Cake",

I loved it as I'm a late millennial, but I also recognize that it's horrible early 90's pop. Love the half indoor/outdoor setup. The apps are killer... apricot spicy wings are on point and the meatballs were tasty (but they only gave you three, and they weren't \"Spanish\" but definitely delicious.)  The bartenders all had their separate polar personalities, but all in all the service was attentive when sitting at the bar.  I'd recommend the bar/apps to anyone in the immediate area, but wouldn't recommend anyone to go out of their way for it.",

    "text": "In town for a week, and stayed at Found:Re. Have had three meals here, from late night sides at the bar the night I checked in to two sit down dinners outside. The ambiance is incredible. The staff are knowledgeable, courteous, attentive (without being intrusive), friendly, and fun. Kaia was very friendly and helpful; Jess, you ROCK.   As for the food...all I can say is that each dish and every side, to include the evilly good desserts, is the visual and taste equivalent of a well orchestrated fireworks display. I have to admit that the first time that I liked at the menu, all I could think of is \"oh, well, another trendy place that takes itself too seriously\". But I couldn't have been more wrong. Everything is fresh, prepared perfectly, presented like a piece of art, and is do pack with complimentary flavors, textures, and in some cases temperatures that each bite is an entirely new experience from the previous. I have one more night here, and although I generally try to try a variety of places when I'm on the road, I know I just return here and treat myself to a new section from the menu.   And, not to be forgotten: even with the obvious painstaking preparation, incredibly fresh and diverse ingredients (locally sourced), and professional staff, the prices are incredibly fair. I will be hear each time I'm in Phoenix, and I will recommend it to ALL I know are heading this way.",

    "text": "Came for happy hour and was immediately enjoying the atmosphere upon walking in. The walls are covered in tasteful Art Deco and the seating is plentiful! The interior gives the feel of a big city upscale hotel restaurant and bar....but without the stuffy crowd and uptight wait staff. The view of the light rail and The Feve was cool because the restaurant is elevated so it creates a great panoramic shot of Central Ave.  The wine by the glass selection didn't impress me but the variety of items on the menu had me curious. I will need to come back for dinner to try more.   I ordered the samosas and chicken wings from the 620 happy hour menu. The samosas were fantastic. They had a little bit of a kick to them...but it wasn't overpowering. They were nice and meaty and served in soft warm pillows of pastry dough. The side of tahini sauce helped w/ the heat of the spices inside the samosas. The chicken wings were huge....but a little prehistoric looking. They were def not \"bar wings\"...but rather an upscale take on a \"bar wing\". There wasn't anything super special about them but they're chicken wings....so no big deal.  The lobster bisque, however,......THAT was a real treat. The broth is not pink and bland like most lobster bisques. It is mushroom in color and has a smooth crimini mushroom flavor that envelops the lobster nicely. Each bite packs a warm hearty flavor and every other bite you find a perfectly cooked gnocchi on your spoon. If you dine here the lobster bisque is a MUST HAVE. The staff was fantastic and very attentive. I would love to give 5 stars but didn't eat enough to really experience what this place is all about. I'll be back for dinner soon.",

Big WOW factor visually with a stunningly decorated lobby, numerous artworks (yes, the naked Burt Reynolds piece behind the reservations desk is particularly fun).   Look someone has obviously poured some mega cash in the stunning interior decor, hip lighting, modern aesthetic etc. This is a big cavernous place.   But the food and service for Brunch at around 1pm yesterday was so utterly ordinary.   Our overly friendly waiter was nice - but really too much. After taking our order for 6 people it took almost 20+ minutes for any food to appear. It was brought by a young kid in dark sunglasses (no prob, food runner we assumed). My frittata was overcooked and just tasted meh. Everyone else agreed the food wasn't bad - but it wasn't exquisite either.   Then our original waiter popped by (nice guy). \"Sorry I left you and it took so long, but I had to help a lady upstairs to her room with her luggage so I was delayed!\"  Luggage? Hmmm this was weird. Since when is a waiter in a fine restaurant running luggage? Weird.   He offered me refills on my grapefruit juice 4 times. Even offering to make me one to go.    Then things got even kookier.  10 min later we hear yelling coming from the kitchen. Very loud. We just all looked at each other. Suddenly a man we had never seen popped over to our table and said he apologized for \"what happened.\"    \"Gee what happened?\" I asked.   \"Um nothing. Thanks.\" Said the man as he quickly dashed away.    Huh??? Well why come over in the first place? Weird.   So let me surmise: this is not at the Brunch quality of my fave restaurant \"Fame\" just north on Central. Fame kicks the \"trying too hard\" fancy schmancy pseudo-hipster Match to the curb.   Match seems all Warhol styled glitter and very little under the airbrushed exterior. Those raving reviews so far on YELP are likely not an indication of some incredible new place.   Match also has problems with staff. If a waiter is hauling luggage, then something is desperately wrong. Avoid. Not impressed.",

The Phx sandwich (turkey) was ordered based on how delicious it was the week before.  Today it was so-so and the fries were dark, some burnt, and overall should not have been served.  Called a staff person over and he said they look like normal fries and from that comment we therefore had nothing more to discuss.  This place had gone through management soooooo many times.  The new GM came over and he BS'd us with his implication that they looked fine.  It wasn't till I started to take pics that they knew they were wrong.  FINALLY, a waiter that came up to the bar peeked over and commented that those should never have been served.  Architecturally this is such an awesome place.  The GM is young and if history repeats itself at the Match, as it has 4-6 times in the past two years, new management will come in again in a matter of time.  Granted the bill was modified for the unpleasant experience.  I just so wish this place would succeed.",

The last time was on a Sunday morning to have brunch. We were told that the restaurant wasn't ready to begin seating and it was recommended we wait at the bar. Moving to the bar, we'd just sat down when we were told the bar couldn't take our orders, anyone's orders, because the only server had to seat and serve a big group of people who came in after us who had been part of a yoga group at the pool.   We were there 10 minutes before they even began to wander in. The restaurant and hotel knew that there was a great chance that there would be a number of people eating, yet they only scheduled one server for the restaurant and bar? And then they rebuffed the first group to arrive?  The menu has gotten boring, they've gone through multiple chefs, and they don't appear to appreciate their clientele.   I'd recommend going anywhere else.",

I love the ambiance - wide windows that slide open on a fine day, a small outdoor patio where you can nosh at happy hour and generally friendly service. Had I written this review after my first couple of times there, I would have likely given four or five stars but they've really changed up the menu and I'm unimpressed. My hunch is that the chef behind the menu has also changed and that's what is driving my discomfort. It's become really ordinary and sort of bar food menu as opposed to the interesting dishes they had in the past. It's also not cheap so they need to pick up their game. When you change up a menu, don't scrap the whole thing. Make seasonal changes to the things that are working - your consistent loyal customers will thank you.",

Their order was taken and drinks delivered in a very timely manner. We, however, were there 20-25 minutes and not a single staff member even looked our direction. We were in the dead center of the dining room, but apparently had our invisibility cloaks on. The staff to patron ratio, including kitchen crew, was very close to 1:1 so we left feeling quite baffled.   Good luck.",

    "text": "Short Story - NOT BAD FOOD but the food I tried this time was very underwhelming.   The restaurant at the Foundre is NEW AGAIN! At the time of this review (9-24-17) Match Cuisine & Cocktails is under a different Chef. But I picked this restaurant because I LOVE the whimsey artsy museum atmosphere and more importantly the restaurant week menu sounded amazing and was among my favorites.  Longer Story- My first course was the Tabbouleh with Ahi. The Ahi and the Non-Traditional Tabbouleh lacked flavor. Onions were unusually strong. It was ok but I wouldn't want to eat this again.  Main Course was the Halibut. I do have to give credit to whoever cooked the fish that it was textbook perfect with a great sear and the fish was moist and flakey...just right. The vegetables were all prepared with a nice caramelization (tomato wedge was slow roasted). But it was the parsley sauce that was very flat and one note. This dish was good and nothing was wrong with it but it wasn't interesting at all. I wouldn't come here to have it again.  I was hoping that dessert would wow me ....just a little bit.  Then my heart just dropped out of my chest and I almost choked when I saw the dessert.  We received two bowls smeared with a small amount of tapioca pudding that was mixed with small bits of chopped fruit and topped with toasted coconut. This dessert was depressing. It made me think of the $1.50 puddings that many diners back east used to serve that taste better with a little cinnamon and whipped cream. The tapioca also reminded me of Hunts Snack Packs...but doctored up and a little.....  My husband pretty much had a similar experience. Some things were good like the gnocchi and the short rib was good but many things to him were also underwhelming.   Our waiter was great and attentive. All the staff seemed welcoming.  I stopped by the restrooms on the way out and most of them were a disaster. Looked like frat boys or a pack of wild animals did a number 1 & 2 on them.  My husband let the man at the desk know about the restrooms.  2.5 stars",

    "text": "We were pretty disappointed with this over all experience. We went for brunch/lunch on Easter in addition to a birthday celebration for my mom, excited to try something new. We had a reservation at 12:30 but weren't sat at our table until at least 1:00, if not later, and subsequently waited until at least 2:00 before receiving our food. Being busy on a holiday is understandable, but there was a general disregard for the fact that an hour and a half from the time of the reservation before receiving any food is excessive, especially for brunch. Our server was not to blame and brought a complimentary appetizer \"to hold us over\", but this was after sitting at our table for an hour, and our food arrived immediately after. What was also somewhat baffling was that there was no offer from the manager (who passed us by numerous times during our half hour wait in the lobby before seating us, and countless times over the hour we waited at the table)to take so much as a drink off of our $200 check in exchange for our patience. I would like to add that this was seemingly the experience that all  guests present at the time shared. We witnessed several tables asking to \"speak to a manager\", and watched the table next to us have to walk up to the hostess stand to request their check because the manager forgot to bring it to them (after they complained about the length of time they had waited, since they had somewhere else to be...).  I would be willing to give this place a second chance, but only because of the atmosphere, awesome art display, indoor/outdoor seating, certainly not because of the service we received the first time around. As a group of people coming from a service industry background, this was somewhat painful all around from a dining experience perspective. On a positive note, it gave us plenty of time to catch up with family.",

The library is closed at this time, so no parking across the street.   Service: Variable, but often bad. I have been a few times and am less than impressed. Once, we went and asked the hostess about happy hour. We were specifically there for happy hour. She sat us in the normal seating area, not in the bar, and stated we can order happy hour. Then, another hostess(?) or employee seemed irritated we had been seated and asked why we were there. We explained, and then she said it was ok. Finally, the waitress helped us and came by, and she was more than irritated that we were there for happy hour, seated in a normal area, not the bar. This is not our fault; the hostess staff said it was ok and said happy hour was served everywhere!  Anyway, whatever, we got the food from the HH menu.   Other times, the wait staff have been apathetic, seemingly annoyed that there are people there to serve, and just ok. I went to the Urban Ale Trail, which the bar was not prepared. They did not have adequate snacks and were short staffed. Though the man right before me used his credit card, I was told cash was best. Then, after being charged AND paying, another bartender tried to ring me up. I told him I had already paid; he almost did not believe me. A few minutes later, this same person tried to ring me up AGAIN for a third time. Again, I said, I paid.  Communication should be key here.  A couple of other times, when I went for brunch, there were few people to serve, but wait staff were almost irritated that there were customers.   Food: Not great and overpriced.  However, I have had some tasty juices in the morning. The happy hour menu had some odd pickled veggies and hummus. It was odd - just ok. There was not enough bread for the hummus. I think the brunch menu has better options.   Ambiance: This is the cool part and why MATCH does not get just one star. This place is cool! The art work is odd but interesting. The lobby has a huge long table, which is excellent for large groups. There is an outdoors patio, and even indoors, the windows can be opened for fresh air.",

    "text": "I went to Match for their Thanksgiving dinner with a friend. We had a reservation for 6pm. The dinner supposed to be provided was a 3 course meal starting off with butternut squash soup. The soup was okay, nothing out of the ordinary. For the main course the menu said turkey with a cranberry sauce, brussel sprouts, stuffing, and mashed potatoes. Our plates showed up with turkey with gravy and green beans instead of brussel sprouts, with a weird stuffing that resembled a quinoa salad, salty mashed potatoes, and no cranberry sauce. It was 6pm and they had already run out of brussel sprouts AND cranberry sauce! Soon after that I could overhear them telling other guests that they had ran out of mashed potatoes. How to you put on a Thanksgiving meal and start running out of items listed on the menu at 6pm?! The only decent thing food wise was the pumpkin pie with a marshmallow type topping. My friend and I were both highly disappointed with the food for the price. The one good thing about our visit was the waitstaff, they were great. I felt bad for them as they were the face of the failure and caught all the backlash from customers due to poor planning.",

The drinks menu offers drinks that sound delicious with subtle flavors and nuance but I was disappointed in the taste of my drink.

Except we had reservations at 6pm and they were already substituting items from the menu because they had run out. Portions were downsized and people were told they had to wait on some items to be prepared because they ran out. Horrible planning on the restaurants part. They even ended up closing early because they ran out of things. The only reason I'm giving this restaurant two stars is because of our amazing server Makenzie. She was amazing and apologized greatly for the inconvenience, you could tell the wait staff was quite embarrassed about the entire ordeal.",

    "text": "OK - full disclosure: If I don't like something I'm not going to write about it.  Unless that something is \"holymotherofpearlthesepeoplearecrazy\" and need to be visited if nothing else but for the amazing drama; like Amy's Baking Company.  Also, if you read my other reviews you'll notice a theme.  That is - do the Chef's Choice dinner.  But only if you're adventurous culinarily (is that even a word?).  No, not every single thing you get is going to be the best you've ever tasted, but you'll walk away with a real appreciation of the chef/restaurants' talent.  OK-POKE (see what I did there?) - I took my mom there for an early mother's day.  She'd never had a chef's progression dinner and this was my chance to show off how much smarter and loving I am as a child than my brother and sister.  We arrived before they were officially seating so we sat outside.  Which turned out to be the best choice ever.  Our server, Taylor, immediately connected with my mom...which sucks for me because that meant stories of what a chalk-eater I am...er, was.  Anyway, I can't speak highly enough about Taylor without sounding like I'm hitting on her...which I'm not.  But she was perfect as a server - on this particular occasion I did want more attention spent on us than when I'm just out with my wife (see why I'm not hitting on her?).  So, we handed back our menus and said \"whatever Chef Hobbs is willing to make, bring it out.\"  What ended up happening is a 9-course dinner with some items that were on the menu, like the poke bowl, and some of that evening's specials (like the grilled octopus).  A few things that he'd never served to other guests in his entire life were also brought out.  He literally made up stuff for us.  Seriously.  Obviously not every dish was \"our favorite dish ever\".  They were all good or better, and showcased his technical talent.  But there were a few things that stood out.  Some might surprise you.  The first thing that was \"ohmygodsellthekidsformoneysowecaneatthisforever\" good were the french fries.  I'm not \"ducking\" with you - these were even better than McDonald's fries.  I know, I went there.  Next, was the linguine carbonara.  This is (at the time of this writing) an uber-rich pasta dish with linguine (duh!), pork belly, peas and a classic carbonara sauce topped with prosciutto and barely poached egg-yolk.  Sell your kids for the money to buy this.  The last thing that I'm going to tell you about is the A5 Wagu ribeye.  So tender that grandma without teeth could eat this.  You could literally mush this to the roof of your mouth with your tongue it was so tender.  I used my teeth because I had them though.  Anyway, one more thing that needs mentioning is their mescal shot.  I'm not sure it's something you could really order, but just say \"Aurora made this mescal shot with a chili-rubbed orange for this guy on Yelp and we want one\".  Well, that's finally it.  Go there.  Check it out.  Call ahead and tell them you want to do a chef's tasting meal.  Tell them about your allergies and preferences and then sit back.  Be adventurous.  It's worth it.",

    "text": "UPDATE, Fall 2018 Uh oh. Looks like that great new chef exited, stage left. And what remains in the wake of his departure is a bit of a face dive. Nothing we ordered was good enough to warrant a review. The waiter was kind enough to offer to have his current chef make me a version of the wonderful Cauliflower-Coconut Fritters (they are no longer on the menu), but what I received had nothing in common with its predecessor. It was just deep fried cauliflower devoid of flavor or crunch. (They didn't even serve it with dipping sauce.) Also ordered a Caprese Salad with heirloom tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, and balsamic - it was deeply forgettable. This is weird... there was no balsamic on it! (and no flavor). When I asked for a side of dressing to try and rescue it, the waiter brought me some other kind of vinegar. LOL. Oh well. It's a bummer seeing a place that had potential, veer off in a bad direction. Giving it two stars instead of one because the interior of the bar and restaurant  has a cool vibe / look. You could always grab a beer there... THAT, they can't mess up.  ------- ORIGINAL REVIEW Since they brought in the new chef, this place is quite good. Love the local art on the walls, the valet service makes it easy to park, and the staff is attentive and friendly.  What to order:  - The Cauliflower-Coconut Fritters are divine. Crispy on the outside, tender and delicious inside. It's like eating the best tempura you've ever had. So good, I'm tempted to just get two orders of them for dinner and forgo anything else.  - Shout out as well to the Grilled Mahi Fish Tacos and the Elote Summer Corn Salad - order them together! You won't regret it. The beautiful crunch and freshness of the corn pairs perfectly with the delectable tacos. My only caveat is the tacos are a touch dry - you can fix this by dousing them in salsa and ordering a few slices of avocado on top. Enjoy!  Issues with the hotel/meeting space: - Match is located inside the FOUND:RE hotel, and this puts a damper on our view of the restaurant. For some reason, new hotel management has decided not to work with patrons/local business to make their meeting space available unless a minimum of 20 sleeping rooms are also reserved. This makes it impossible to have meetings there for even the largest and most prominent local customers, and will likely land the hotel (and the restaurant) in a problematic relationship with downtown Phoenix. It should also be mentioned that they do not communicate their policies well, or get back to interested parties in a timely manner to discuss these details. A shame overall, as the place has a lot of promise. But an establishment is only as good as its management.",

I will say the service was slow; we ordered off the restaurant week menu so it was 3 courses and we ended up being there close to 3 hours so I wouldn't recommend this spot for a \"quick\" bite. I would recommend it in every other capacity, however! And slow isn't bad-- must not confuse the two. Our server was very friendly and I felt he was genuinely excited to make my birthday dinner special. I will be back, I will tell my friends and I hope to see this place thrive.",

We had a Caesar salad which had very little resemblance to a real Caesar, and sadly, not even half as tasty.  The salmon fillet that accompanied this salad seemed to have been deep fried, or else it was cooked to within an inch of its life, dry and leathery.  The Manhattan drink was a mystery to us...why call a drink a Manhattan or a salad a Caesar when you're making something else?  It wouldn't have been so bad if everything wasn't so ridiculously expensive.",

Our group started in the restaurant where we had a sampling of the food along with introduction to the Chef, who gave a nice philosophy of his cook and inspiration for his dishes. And his food was great, a standout for me was the beet salad. Locally grown baby beets prepared in a unique way that made them the best darn beets I have ever had. All of the food is procured in and procured from the surrounding area, so there is a definite respect and support for the local growers. A wide variety of offerings and various specials throughout the week make the dining experience something new every time. The decor is a knockout, with local artist's work on the walls and the even the seating, tables and bar are works of art. Industrial style art done very well, tasteful, beautiful and fun. MATCH is right on the light rail line, in the center of the Art area of the city. A great place to meet for any type of date or gathering of friends, relaxed and friendly.",

It's pretty apparent that there was a change in chef, and the menu went from heavily Latin-inspired to an amalgamation of dishes that aren't quite cohesive.   That being said, the crispy pork belly was expertly prepared, and the cocktails were good. The gnocchi, however, was pretty bland and not al dente. It is a pretty watered down culinary experience from what it used to be.",

    "text": "We were looking for a different experience and a quick meal before attending a Mercury game. Friends recommended this location. We checked out the reviews ahead of time, so we knew what to expect for parking, but got lucky to find street parking on a Saturday night. The Found:Re hotel looks pretty interesting. We really liked the brightness and openness or the bar and restaurant areas, along with the industrial/contemporary, yet comfortable decor.   I liked that they brought a large corked bottle of cold water for the table - this time of year in Phoenix, it's important to stay hydrated. I ordered an Orchid Spritz - it was good but a little pricey.   Because they change the menu often (farm to table), my husband was a little disappointed that some items were not available (escargot, pizza), but I was intrigued by the variety of their spring menu. We were so glad we tried the Cauliflower Coconut Fritters. They were done perfectly and were so flavorful. My husband would have liked a little more of the green chili aioli sauce for dipping. I could have made a meal out of these!   We both were craving a salad, but it didn't appear they offered a side salad, so we split the Caesar salad. It was really unique - fresh greens, crisp cherry tomatoes. It had onions, hard-boiled egg and crunchy croutons. It's always challenging to get a balance of enough but not too much dressing - I felt this one was a little light - I couldn't really get a sense of the flavor of the dressing, but my husband liked it.   My husband and I ordered the Hamburger and the Flank Steak respectively. Each came with fries (which were perfectly prepared -soft on the inside, crisp on the outside) with your choice of sauces. We got both catsup and garlic aioli. We asked for each to be prepared medium rare - and both were definitely far closer to rare than medium rare. Fortunately the meat was flavorful and good, or we would have asked to have them recook it. So be sure to ask your server to define what medium rare looks like if you are squeamish about under-cooked meat.   The burger had Swiss cheese and sun-dried tomatoes (yum!) - it came with onions, but my hubby had them put them on the side. My steak was delicious - a bit pricy ($22) for the size - it only looked to be 4-5 ounces.   Our server was Brittany, and she was great. Just the right blend of attentiveness, information and giving us space to enjoy the meal. Very timely with the check once we let her know we were trying to make the tip-off for the game.   We most definitely will be back to try their brunch and lunch menus. It will be a great place to meet friends. BTW- the light rail stops just south of the restaurant, so that takes care of the parking issue next trip!",

    "text": "One for location - Two for concept.  The rest of this was a kind of a nightmare.  I ordered the egg sandwich, The list of ingredients included bacon and Gruyere.  When my sandwich was brought to me it had neither bacon nor Gruyere it only had avocado and an egg.  When she came back to the table I tried to tell her that it was missing multiple items and she whisked away very quickly with a very odd smile and ignored me.  I then walked over to the window, I let them know that it was also missing bacon and then I heard the lady tell the chef that it was only missing Gruyere.  They kept telling me not to worry that they had me.  But I said listen, it was also missing the bacon she didn't tell him to add the bacon.  20 minutes later I literally still had no food.  When we asked about it we were then told by the waitress that my sandwich had been remade but someone else took it.  Here's the kicker, there were four tables total including ours in the restaurant.  I looked at the other three tables none of them were eating an egg sandwich.  10 more minutes later, my second sandwich was brought out this time as you can see in the photo I was given raw shredded Gruyere on my sandwich.  I asked her normally when I order an egg sandwich the cheese will be melted is this on purpose and she just kept smiling that odd smile.  Then she asked me if she could take it back to the kitchen after 30 minutes of waiting for it I decided to eat the cold shredded cheese on my terrible sandwich.  He did a good job basting the eggs that is the only thing nice I can say.  The manager was absolutely wonderful in terms of trying to give me as many free things that she could think of.  Nothing made up for the fact that I was starving to death and waited for a total of 45 minutes for probably One of the worst sandwiches I've ever had.",

I get here on the light rail, so I've never had to deal the peculiar parking procedures around Portland Park. I also eat here in the morning or pre-dinner afternoon, as my desire to deal with dinner crushes is zero (and the brunch menu is enough to keep me busy for weeks).  It's a short menu, which works for me because everything sounds good, so I'm only forced to make heartbreaking choices among 7-8 items instead of picking through 30. So far, I've had a beautifully prepared Benedict, very rich and delicious hazelnut toast with nectarines, and a burger that was good but honestly swamped in my memory by this amazing dessert that was sort of pudding with delicious debris floating in it.  My preference is to eat at the bar, where I can ask the bartender stupid questions like \"how do you spell the wifi password?\" This also means I'll get told more about why the wine I ordered is good, which is fine with me.  Really, I'd like exactly 34.52% of my life to involve a lifestyle where I just came here for every meal.",

They have a variety of local AZ wines, plus a good combination of old and new world wines.  The coconut rum cream salmon entree is top notch. (Ask for more of the sauce, you can put it on anything!) I'd encourage this place for a great date night or an event since they have a variety of open spaces that could cater to a large group.   I'm looking forward to coming back.",

    "text": "The variety of the menu is very intriguing to me and that's what drew me into choosing this place when meeting up with one of my oldest friends who I haven't seen in awhile. She arrived before me and chose a nice table by the patio. There was a grassy greenbelt-ish area behind her dividing the tall condos nearby. It almost seemed like we were in some other city!  Anyway, back to happy hour, being a bourbon drinker, I ordered the Mizuwari - bourbon, ginger, mineragua (a Mexican club soda). It was a very refreshing, enjoyable cocktail.  I really wanted to order the Jamaican patties, but my friend was trying to stay away from beef or pork, so we agreed on.. Celery Root Hummus Appetizer -pickled veggies, warm toasted bread, paesano olive oil.  As someone who doesn't really enjoy veggies but learning to, I really enjoyed the pickled vegetables. The hummus had a thinner consistency than I'm accustomed to but it made it feel lighter with great taste. Maybe it meant it was healthier and I didn't have to feel as guilty about eating it too? Eh, wishful thinking probably but still good  Indian Butter Chicken Samosas - they had the appearance of those Chinese crab wontons but indeed were far from it and better of course! We really loved these chicken samosas. The taste and texture reminded me of really tasty empanadas but stylish looking ones. Definitely worth the order!  Gregorio Pizza - these pizzas are personal sized. Prosciutto, arugula, pine nut marscapone, and fig vinegarette. These 3 ingredients were a trifecta of my favorite tastes in one. I enjoyed this but this particular one, the cheese was a bit on the crispier overdone side so if I could re-order this perfectly, I wish the cheese was more similar to my friend's Grateful Shroom where there was more cheese and it was melted perfectly! I was having cheese jealousy looking at hers!  Filipino Kush - this I ordered to go and I was an idiot and forgot it on the table when we left!!! I am devastated because I really wanted to try this one since it was giving a shout out to my Filipino roots with housemade Longanisa sausage! I used to eat Longanisa sausages with eggs and rice for breakfast plenty of mornings. My mom always had it around! Oh well, I guess I'll have to try it another time!  The eclectic atmosphere and world inspired menu are both things that make for a great adventurous happy hour. I'm curious about trying more things next time! Hopefully that Filipino pizza will still be around for me to try it!",

Had brussels sprouts as a side and they were a little undercooked/hard and just not flavorful. I feel like it's hard to mess up brussels! Cook them long enough, get them crispy even, and soak them in something (balsamic?) and you have a winner for 95% of the population.   We had some appetizers, salads, and nothing was quite right. One of the salads had like a Parmesan cheese crisp sandwich thing with too-much cheese. The \"greens\" on the side of every appetizer and dish were not good - maybe try some nice spicy arugula? Not sure what those greens were but they were not good. There was just no balance or flow to the food.... nothing was special and nothing was memorable. It wasn't bad, just not worthy of spending my money. Uninspired I guess. Where's the love?  The ambience is wonderful! We sat on the patio and bar looks pretty sweet and everything inside was just delightful, including the artwork in the lobby.   Like another reviewer mentioned, this place has so much potential but it is just untapped with the current menu. I feel like it's more like 2.5 stars, but I'm a round-up kind of girl.",

The Moroccan Spiced Chicken was a bit wishy-washy, lack of flavor and the chicken smells like a raw chciken. In the other hand, Oven-Roasted Crispy Skin Salmon tasted like chard and we asked the attendant about it and he cake back saying that \"per Cheft\" that was really the taste. The attendant was really helpful and he suggested to changed it and we did. However, we waited for almost 2 hours to get it unfortunately, it didnt arrive and we decided to cancel it.  I'm not sure if we will go back again because their food is a bit pricey but it wasn't good at all.",

Our group got a sampling of about five different dishes as well as dessert and everything was at least above average.  The consensus standout was the chicken samosas, which were perfectly spiced.  In fact, all of the dishes, spicy or not, were incredibly well seasoned and flavorful.  The cocktails were inventive and the wine list, while not extensive, did cover all the critical flavor profiles.  The restaurant itself was a perfect marriage of artistic and classy.  Of special note about tonight: there was a very large birthday party going on (30+ people) and while other restaurants might have been overwhelmed, MATCH did not miss a beat.  The only constructive criticism I would offer would be regarding the bathroom.  Bathrooms are a hallway of unisex stalls with sliding doors.  It's unique approach and would be fine except that the doors don't completely shut and there were a couple of mosquitos in mine (very usual).  Here are the ratings:  Food: ***** Ambiance ***** Value ***** Bathrooms ***  Overall, highly recommended and great addition to the Phoenix dining scene.",

Our server was sweet but when my friend asked for chicken sausage, he got a plate with bacon on top. When he mentioned that he asked for chicken sausage, she takes the plate to the kitchen, took the bacon off and gave him the same plate and said the chicken sausage will be right out. The salad was even wilted from the bacon. He doesn't eat pig and that just seemed super inappropriate, along with it not seeming to follow health code. Also, when I asked for a mimosa and to only have a little orange juice because I don't like it sweet, she said sure! And then proceeded to tell me that it'll be a minute because they're making the mimosas. Clearly, they were pre made which is understandable!! But don't tell me sure, and then give me a mimosa full or orange juice. Again, she was nice but just a little spacey.",

    "text": "Be honest, how many times have you had Italian and Peruvian in the same meal?  That's a rhetorical question because anyone who just raised their hands is a liar.  That is unless of course you've been here before.  Match is the signature restaurant for the new Found:RE Hotel on Central & Portland.  It's a stones throw from my apartment Downtown so naturally I'm happy to have another option nearby.  But how does a mishmash of seemingly incompatible cuisines measure up?  Found:RE Hotel takes over what once was (a LONG time ago) a Best Western that had been abandoned for years.  It was an eyesore and something I was eager to see torn down as it gathered dust and was a blight on an otherwise beautiful boulevard on Portland Street.  And then suddenly a group of investors swarmed in to resurrect the old hotel building giving it a complete overhaul and adding a street side restaurant called Match.  The restaurant is huge with seating for probably close to 200 people at full capacity (probably more with standing room only space).  I took a stroll through here on opening night to look around and it was jam-packed with Downtown workers, neighborhood locals, and hotel guests.  I figured I'd give it a little time before coming back to let the crowds dwindle a bit and for Match to work out the initial growing pains every restaurant inevitably faces.  On a Friday during Happy Hour, I was able to plant myself at the bar and get served right away.  If you haven't viewed Match's website yet you should know in advance that Match's menu is pretty extensive.  In part because this restaurant is open pretty much all day every day.  This always makes me a little nervous when I see this as I've found those restaurants that try to be good at everything are often not great at anything.  But I did a little research in advance of coming here so as to not be overwhelmed when choosing my fix for the evening.  The bar staff was also super friendly and lent me their expertise as well.  For a drink starter, i had the Peruvian Pearls.  I love me some pisco sours and this was certainly similar to the ones I've had in the past, though their rendition was more potent than others I've had.  Not overpowering, but plenty of alcohol and enough spice to keep your taste buds wide awake.  I'd arrived a little early for dinner (which they don't normally serve until 5pm), but I had my heart set on the Gnocchi & Meatballs.  The bartender was kind enough to have an exception made for me so that I could grab that dish a little earlier than usual.  This absolutely lived up to the hype.  I'm a sucker for gnocchi and this version was phenomenally tender and buttery.  And the meatballs and meat sauce that went with it were an amazing accompaniment.  How come I've never seen Italian restaurants serve this?  And then there was dessert.  And in my case, a trip back to Peru for this one (albeit with a twist).  The Peruvian Posset dessert is just as much art as it is a meal.  The specs on this one: Lime curd, custard, donut holes, and sweet potato chips.  It makes almost no sense at all, but an elegant presentation and even better flavors.  Total cost for the meal, the drink, tax and tip came to about $50.  A little on the steep end perhaps, though I certainly can't knock the creativity of the chef or the menu.  Besides Peruvian and Italian dishes, I caught glimpses of Indian, Greek, Argentinian, Chinese, Japanese, Jamaican and yes even Mexican influences on the menu here.  A truly global menu that tries to find a way to merge seemingly polar opposite gastronomic influences.  Its a great fit for the Found:RE hotel, itself a boutique hotel that's about as different as any you'll find Downtown.  So welcome to the neighborhood, Match.  Keep on pushing the envelope and finding new ways to put a spin on the food and drinks we think we know.",

    "text": "Nick and I came here before going to see the Nutcraker. Everyone seemed very eager to help us as soon as we walked in. We decided to sit at the bar...because well we're bar people. The interior of the restaurant is pretty dark and industrial, but all the artwork really brings it to life. They also have a great communal seating area right by their gallery that would be great to use for an event.  We came during happy hour, but decided to peruse both menus. Their craft cocktails were only $6 on HH...great deal. I ordered the Alpaca to start. It had Fernet, Coke, and mint. It had a great bitter taste that made it a wonderful digestif before our meal. For my second cocktail I had the Peruvian Pearls. It's their take on a Pisco sour. Their sour mix is homemade with egg whites, which I love. They balanced the tartness well by adding coconut to it. We could tell our bartender was dedicated to his craft, but he was still very personable and funny.   We ordered the Chicken Samosas, Poke bowl, and Gnocchi and Meatballs. One thing I love about their menu is that it is truly a multicultural experience. They are a melting pot with Mediterranean, Asian, and Italian dishes (just to name a few). The Samosas had a great flaky crust and delicious, spicy filling, and the Poke bowl had some great acidity. They added vinegar to their rice, and pickles to the bowl which gave it a nice zip. My favorite was definitely the meatballs though. I'm trying to put my finger on why it was so outstanding. I just think the quality and temperature of the meat was superb.  Great upscale spot to impress out of towners, or your partner without breaking the bank. Beautiful experience on all fronts!",

In the evening, the fires the light the patio flicker while you can faintly hear an eclectic playlist from overhead.   The menu is full of familiar foods with twists--apricot glaze? On chicken wings?--that piqued my interest and left me unsure of what to order. Also, the happy hour menu is fairly lengthy and impressively priced. It features a subtle, refreshing pear margarita that somehow disappeared quite quickly.  Quick and efficient staff ensure a smooth dining experience with just enough presence to feel neither neglected nor constantly interrupted.   The free street parking along Portland is usually full, but the parking garage across the street is also free and easy.",

I don't know about the bad Things said about the openness of the kitchen but the concept of the patio and open windows were pretty awesome at night. That being said, the food is wayyyy over priced for what you get. I stayed at the hotel so I was at the restaurant about 3 out of 5 nights of my stay. The steak is sub par at $35. You get THREE jumbo shrimp with the shrimp and pasta. I'm sorry but for 20+ dollars I should get at least 5 pieces. I have mixed feelings about the staff. The host was just chatting up a storm and doesn't really notice anyone unless you make eye contact with them.  I sat at a table the first night and the middle aged server was awesome. He was very knowledgeable about the beer and the food. The beer was about $6 which is pretty comparable to other places. Other mixed feelings come from he bar staff. I told a friend about the place and he had a few drinks with me. One bartender made a drink for him.... not your typical drink so he probably should've looked it up. The drink wasn't great so he asked the other bartender to make it. I think our original bartender was offended so we were punished by being obviously ignored for the rest of the night. The bar needs to get t together",

A great new destination right on Central in the Arts District of Phoenix.  My lunch (French Onion soup and some great bread) was just perfect. We shared a dessert. Rich and chocolaty!  Our server (Janine) couldn't have been friendlier or more on top of our needs. Just loved my first experience at Match.  I was so pleased with that 1st experience that we planned a surprise get-together here with a few friends. Service was outstanding! Although we weren't the only guests in the bar area, we were treated as if we were. Our Server (Maxwell) was super friendly and very knowledgeable about the bar/restaurant, hotel history, local sourced ingredients for both food and drinks . . . and he spent time answering all the questions we had about the new hotel. We never felt rushed or lacking of service. We ordered multiple appetizers (all were great - thanks chef!) and lots of desserts. These were so outstanding that we asked to talk to the Pastry Chef - she came out and gave us details of every dessert we tried. What fun!  There is Interesting local art on all the walls - including a couple of galleries devoted to rotating art exhibits. Be sure to check out the tech art piece in the floor of the front lobby. Not to be missed.   This new hotel (Found:Re) and its restaurant (Match) is the cat's meow! If you are local or just in town visiting, be sure to visit this great new spot.",

I would die for that dish  The main course was the sea bass which was substituted into the menu. Also delicious. Not as good as the appetizer.  Dessert was coconut and passion fruit tapioca!! First off the texture... wow. Taste... wow!!  If you like light but flavourful meals you should split it. So cheap and honestly perfectly portioned for two.  We have been here plenty of times before. The hotel lobby is beautiful, and there's local art everywhere!!  Service this time was a bit slow this time for literally everything, our water and our beer/wine... but our waiter was sweet and brought out two desserts at the end.

Unless you are very adventurous with your drinks, I would steer clear of the cocktails here.

Besides the restaurant's trendy vibe and the AMAZING art on display, the service and culinary artistry was on point.   When we arrived for breakfast, we were greeted by the most lovely hostess. She was courteous, friendly, and familiar. She made us feel at ease and completely welcome. After a lovely conversation about favorite vacation spots, she introduced us to our waiter (Daniel). He was informative, attentive, and extremely knowledgeable about the food. When he came back to refill our coffee mugs, he even remembered our names. Are you kidding me? Who does that? That's an insane level of customer service and truly showed us how much they cared for our experience.  When the food came out, it was absolutely sublime. I had the El Benedicto, which was an Italian twist on eggs benedict. Fluffy cubes of bread sat atop a lovely balsamic glaze and the perfectly poached eggs were drizzled in a savory hollandaise and garnished with crispy prosciutto flakes. My better half had a wonderfully creative shakshuka dish (add your own ingredients) with heavily toasted bread. A perfect blend of middle eastern flavors and influences for breakfast.   The best part, though? How surprisingly affordable breakfast was. It felt like a gourmet experience for an insanely reasonable price. I'd highly recommend MATCH Cuisine to any food lover in Phoenix and beyond!",

I can't name them personally,I guess, but the bar manager with the beard and the blonde with the tattoos were AWESOME. I really feel bad for the staff in this bar. I personally witnessed the upper management sitting, drinking alcohol, stressing the staff out, and getting waited on hand and foot.... While in the middle of a rush, expecting full service from their server. You can tell they are being micromanaged by people that have NO IDEA how to run a restaurant/bar (there's one lady that's always sitting in a booth, kind of a butter face, blonde... I dunno.... she just sat there with her sad frown on her laptop making everyone uncomfortable.) I'm just really sad to know that anyone worth going to this failed concept isn't there anymore. Hopefully my favorites are on to better places, because I know as A DOWNTOWN LOCAL I'll never give this place another second of my time. Such a waste of space.",

    "text": "The atmosphere was tense, not unlike the lingering mood in a public space after the police drag away a shouting vagrant. Too busy for a greeting. Okay. We stood at the hostess station - staff came and went, being careful not to make eye contact and obligate themselves to be hospitable. I counted 3 tables with guests, 4 more guests at the bar, 8 employees on the floor including two manager types. Zero smiles. \"Maybe we're dead,\" I said to my wife, \"like the movie sixth sense. They can't see us but we can see them.\" I pinched my wrist to be sure I still had feeling.  Following five minutes of existential crisis and wondering if perhaps we had over or under dressed, a self-identified first day staff member stopped to explain he had yet to be trained on where to put arriving guests. He went off and wrangled another staff member from their suicidal contemplation to show us to a table. And there we sat. 15 minutes of reviewing the menu, staring at bar staff, servers, bussers, managers and even a few fellow diners to come by and say hello. I debated the drink offerings with my wife and quite pathetically changed my order out loud 3 times.  \"I really do think we're dead,\" I said.  \"It's because you brought a dark brown woman,\" she kidded.  We stared harder and harder. No drink, no charcuterie board, certainly no new watering hole for us. We stood up slowly, looked around and walked along the longest route to the side exit.  I feel bad for leaving the other guests behind. Rumor has it, if you stand quietly by the fountain in Portland park at night, you can hear their small cries for help. Works for the conference-goers, the college kids and the captive hotel guests, but not for us locals that spend hundreds per week dining at the many far better operations within walking distance. And, as it was made clear, Match doesn't need our support. Ciao!",

Sleek, industrial decor, mirroring the hotels interior design. Lots of cement, metal girder and tile accents.  Got the duck salad and was I surprised at the amount of pleasantly Asian spiced pulled duck was on the well shredded slaw salad. The salad had a variety of finely shredded items, like carrot, bell peppers and radish. The size looked okay, but don't let it fool you, it was filling. It had a light dressing that did not dominate by being too oily or too sweet. Actually just right.  The moroccan chix salad was served warm over bulgar wheat and a luacious but light cream dressing. Refreshingly enjoyably not heat spicy, but a mix of new spice tastes to enjoy. Again, quite filling for the nice size of this plate.",

To begin, it was alcoffee, with slow and indifferent service.  The blueberry ricotta pancakes were cooked at too high a temperature, so they were literally crunchy on the outside and fought in the middle.  The \"blueberry compote\" they were supposed to come with never arrived, but they were served with about 10 sad little blueberries on top.  I eventually had to get up and wander around the restaurant to find someone to bring me some maple syrup (which came in a little aluminum dish to make sure I didn't use too much). But that pint, they were done cold and  literally inedible, unless you are a starving coyote.  The server never even inquired why I didn't eat them as she breezily dropped off the check.  These guys need to get their act together.",

I am, however, a person who will be blunt and honest - and share that - when the need arises. So....  Waiting for over 45 minutes for a salad, when there were approximately 25 people total in the entire establishment - bar included, followed with an obligatory, \"Of course we will take care of this,\" is the first - and last - impression I will have of this place. Hardly a salad, and hardly an apology - frankly I would have rather them pay me for the time that I wasted there.   The salad was mediocre, at best (spicy watermelon salad). Nothing I could not have thrown together at home or anything worth having. The drinks were decent, but their whiskey selection leaves much to be desired.   For so many stellar reviews, I was fairly surprised at how lackluster I found this place to be.",

Second, the bar/restaurant has a very cool,hip vibe that makes it fun to hang out, enjoy the food and enjoy the people you went with. It was so nice to be able to see and hear each other over dinner!  Third, the service is amazing. We went as strangers and left feeling like family!  Brandon and Jennifer were amazing and really, the main reason we'd go back. I mean the food was fantastic but the engagement and personal touch by these two over menu selection and wine options couldn't be beat.  Brandon is the GM and he's leading his team to the top!  Thank you to both for making the experience first class!  Ok, on to food....  I ordered the burger and fries. I know. A burger. Jennifer sold me on it and I couldn't say no. It was easily in the top 3 burgers of my life. Cooked perfect and was messy enough for others to tell I was enjoying the whole thing!  LOL!  I also had the beet salad. Totally makes me wish we lived local so I could get it whenever I had a craving! #yummy!  Thank you to the whole team at MATCH for making an ordinary dinner out, so much fun!  We'll be back for sure. :)",

The decor is very modern artsy and is pretty cool. Breakfast entrees are all $10... nice and simple.   I ordered the red chili chilaquiles and an extra spicy Bloody Mary. The Bloody Mary needed more spice, but was decent. For those vegetarians out there like me, there's no fish sauce/anchovies in the Bloody Mary mix they use. The chilaquiles were yummy and definitely have a little kick to them! They have a slightly smokey taste... I was a fan. My husband ordered the Arizona omelette and enjoyed it. Oh, and even though the menu doesn't indicate it, the omelette comes with a side salad and some breakfast potatoes. Also, the portions are reasonable - not too big, not too small.

I was a snob and a fool.  Tucked into the Found:Re, this place is really hip and modern, with a number of different seating options. Because we had a good sized group and it was really nice out, we opted for a larger high top on the patio. The chairs were cushy and amazing, though shockingly heavy to pull out.  A group of us made our way over here after a taco festival at Margaret T Hance one weekend, and were pleased to find that their happy hour is every day from 3-7, and offers some pretty poppin' deals. It's $5 for a beer, and $6 for select cocktails and wines, and a good deal on little snack foods too. Unfortunately, we were all exploding with tacos, so we didn't get to sample any of the food,  I started off with the old fashioned, the drink by which I measure all bars, and was underwhelmed. I know, I know, it's not specifically a whiskey or cocktail bar, and I know, I know, I'm a big ole snob. But, it was a pretty weak-tasting old fashioned that was heavy on the simple syrup and served over standard ice from a machine. But, at $6 a pop, I couldn't be overly upset about it. One of my friends had the pearfect margarita, which she also said was just like drinking juice--heavy on the sugar, not so heavy on the tequila.   I switched to the red blend and it was easy coastin' the rest of the night. My one other gripe was that it seemed like they were out of a handful of items on their menu. Not a huge deal, just a little bit annoying.   Next time I'm in the area, I'll be back again during happy hour to try some of the other drinks and definitely get in on them food deals.",

Room service- Eggs Benedict, yum; because I love eggs Benny's. However, room service as it may be the eggs were over cooked (likely due to transit) and the hollandaise sauce could use some salt or zest.  Pancakes are tasty, thin and very artisanal, nicely not overdone and a good starter to the day in a less heavy fashion than pancakes are thought to be.   We'll be back. We love the foundre.",

I came here just for drinks with my bf, we were able to sit outside on the patio but it was still connected all inside. I loved the location of this and how it was facing the downtown streets. All the variety of seating here is so unique! It had the best vibes all around! You're also welcome to explore the hotel which is connected to the restaurant if you'd like, which ofc we did! Even the bathrooms were unique! There were interesting paintings that are relevant to today's day and age which I found the most cool to look at! Now we tried two drinks, one being the mule cocktail, which was TO DIE for it included ginger beer which I found so so tasty!! I also had the pearfect margarita which was more strong but still just so good! Paid about $30 for two drinks..little pricy I suppose but given a good night and the ambiance of this place I would pay that all over! My server I believe was James, who shared some interesting stories with us and treated us so kindly, checking up on us often! I even would request for James when I do come back! Lovely place! Alrdy one of my favorites!! I'll be recommending here to lots of people! This is for sure a place i will come back to often for drinks! Can't wait to come back!!((:",

    "text": "3.5 but I'll round up for making the waiter run around asking questions for us.  I wanted to try this place out since I heard about it being street food centric in an article on AZcentral. We were downtown so we thought we give it a try. I heard interesting things about parking there so we just decided to walk instead..also we already paid for the whole day in the garage and didn't want to leave  \\_()_/ . The atmosphere is pretty cool, if you have to wait for a table you can take a stroll in the lobby and look at the art. And now to the food. We ordered the lobster bisque, indian butter chicken somosas, AZ burger, Gregorio pizza, and grateful shroom pizza, all paired with a nice riesling. I know not all of this is considered \"street food,\" but due to the sharing nature compromises had to be made. Starting of with the lobster bisque, a small cup was enough for 3 of us to have a good tasting. The waitress told us the broth takes 3 days to make and I believe her. The bisque was very rich and flavorful and included hearty chunks of lobsters and gnocchis. The samosas were  another hit of the night, with nice flaky crust and moist and flavorful chicken (with a kick) paired with a cooling cucumber raita. I'm not usually a person that orders a burger when there are other more exotic choices on the menu, but surprises come where you least expect. The surprise here was the pickles...you heard right the pickles! They were so good we had to order more (its $1.50 for extra pickles) and ask the waitress what kind they were and where to get them. And you thought I was gonna rave about the actual burger. The burger was meh at most...meat was fine and the tomato and pickles add nice texture and flavor that it lacks. The homeboy's habanero spread would have saved it, but was seriously overpowered by the red fife wheat roll and you couldn't taste anything but the crumbly hard crusted roll. The pizzas were nothing really to talk about either, I was very disappointed in the Gregorio. It was supposed to have mascarpone and fig but all we tasted was salt.  Overall a very interesting place to come with a group of friends and try new things (the pickles). Will definitely be back to try some more of the \"street food\" dishes.",

We thought the food was great. However the service was pretty poor. The hostesses barely said hello and did crack a smile. Weird. We noticed someone who looked like a manger nervously pacing around with an unopened bottle of wine in hand during our entire dinner, didn't say hello or smile. Again kind of weird.  After we put our drink orders in our waitress disappeared for what seemed like forever. She popped over once during dinner whenI had to flag her down for another drink.   We kind of brushed of the poor service considering it's a new place on a Saturday night.   However, we returned again with family a couple weeks later for brunch and the service was even worse. Again, no smiles or warm and fuzzies from the hostesses. We had a few questions about the menu and we got a lot of \"huh?\" And \"dunno\". While taking our orders she spaced out and said \" sorry I was watching the people in the pool\"? Weird.   As for the brunch menu, it was okay. My husband got the Korean lettuce wraps that looked like 2 small pieces of romain. Should be an app not a $14 entree.   All in all, I don't think we will be back, which is a shame because it's got such a cool concept and  beautiful space.",

Let's not shy away from the immaculate and incredibly tasty dishes of the night: the gnocchi and halibut were over capable of satisfying the palette and had beautiful touches that were sure to catch the eye.

My fiance had the Hinano lager from Tahiti and I had the Indian Pale Ale from Mother Road in flagstaff (a favorite of mine)  and also decided to order the wings.

Sustainable Salmon for example, or cocktails that literally taste like dirt - not my words - this came from everyone who tried it at the table. I LOVE the space. And the staff is incredible. But the food left us wanting something a little more simple. It's so hard to describe. It's just like they're trying way too hard. In addition 2 friends that had the hamburger one night in January both got the same food poisoning which laid them out for 10 days - during a trip we all had to Costa Rica. Not cool.  But fast forward to last night. A big group of us took up 3 of their largest tables and had a blast. I stuck to rum & cokes which was perfect. No menu drinks for me anymore. And we ordered the Korean Short Ribs and the Poke Bowl for apps. These were fantastic! Then for dinner we had the Pork Chop and Steak Frittes. Again, everything was so good! Even our friend that had previously been given food poisoning was next to me. He got the Gregorio Pizza and it all turned out great.  In addition, we had the pleasure of Lauren taking care of us. She was on top of this group the entire night. She's funny, super helpful, and knew what each of us wanted before WE did. I never once had to order another drink. One was just always there. It was a perfect night. I'm so glad that we kept finding our way back here, because with this space I really wanted to love this restaurant. Nice job!",

    "text": "The food wasn't too bad, fairly average. My wife and I use open table to book almost all of the restaurants that we go to and this one wasn't an exception. We had earned a $20 reward and you have to schedule it online at a restaurant to use it so we did for MATCH. At the end of our meal our waiter came out and told us that they didn't accept those and that they didn't participate with open table even though we used the app to make and appointment and they had revived it. So we lost our $20 reward. When we asked if we could see a manager the waiter said they couldn't come out. So we asked the waiter to check again if we could use the reward. When we asked the GM there said they refused to speak to us and that they wouldn't give us any compensation on our bill. Super super rude management. The waiter told us that turn over there is super high and that people aren't around very long. No reason to go back and you shouldn't either.",

Really liked the atmosphere of this place .. all the windows were open , the art work was amazing and the staff were suggestive and polite ..      Round 2.. later that eve we returned for another meeting and some evening drinks and dishes ..   While the service was a little shaky at first, the server was very polite and personable. I wasn't starving so tried some side dishes ... One of my friends is vegetarian & I don't eat pork.. I ordered the green beans without pork which they gladly accommodated and the frites w/ both the garlic aoli   & Korean ketchup, & ( no it's not heinz w/ Sriracha sauce ) Both were great and hit the spot .. Then as a nightcap we all dove into their specialized cocktails ..  I chose the Hong Kong apothecary .. The wait was longer than expected and with our current drinks empty I walked up to the bar to see what all these drinks entail ..   Once received, I tried my drink ..  It was a drink I would not normally want to try but I was feeling like going outside my comfort level .. In the end. I finished it and enjoyed to interesting notes of this unique cocktail ..  In all the ambiance and the food are perfectly paired .. I'm excited to have this place in my neighborhood and will likely make this new place my stomping grounds",

I like their glassware and unique ingredients. Definitely could learn a thing or two drinking here.   The ambience is what really sells this place. Love the feel and openness of it. Right on the NW corner of Portland and Central. With the floor to ceiling windows open it is easy to just sit and <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fchill.at&s=4b7abd669adf1dea012d7ba92756a3ae6a19d4da7fde48cf17948f9b41769357\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">chill.at</a> this bar. Art gallery/hotel/bar/restaurant. Super into it. Everything is new so it looks very clean. Sets a fantastic foundation for some truly good f+b.   Ate for the first time today. 'Mid-day' menu. Had the Calabrese pizza and a side of the pork belly green beans. Green beans were out first. Being super hungry, I started inhaling those suckers. Very good, but I will say this:  for 6-7 dollars I could have dealt with less beans more pork belly, but hey, it was good so no complaints really.   The pizza was also really good. Some fresh tasting ingredients. Portion was great. Honestly, could've split the green beans and pizza with my girl. Only critique would be it was pretty salty. I thought this while shoving it into my face and thought \"it's pizza dude. It probably should be a salty, greasy, mess.\" Nonetheless, I offer my take:  The (pickled?) peppers were pretty salty (along with all the other great flavors they leant), and on top of pepperoni and cheese... I just wonder if the cook added unnecessary salt, or if it's just the ingredients and I'm a loser. The flavors were great, it was salty and greasy, but it's pizza, right?   I like this spot. It's close by and mellow. One of my new favorite spots. Will be back.",

Holy moly was it good!!! When places use fresh, locally sourced products you can definitely tell.   I had steak and eggs with potatoes, toasty, and a little tomato/arugula/avocado salad. The steak was cooked perfectly, melting in my mouth with a sauce that was lick-your-plate good. My eggs were fluffy and delicious. I'm not a big roasted potatoes fan so I didn't love those, but it's just not my thing. The salad was SOOOOO good, I wanted more!   My friend had this Sashuksa something-or-other, which was eggs, potatoes, and his choice of toppings baked over stewed tomatoes. So much flavor! He also ordered a side of bacon that was as almost thick as my steak. I could only stomach one bite of it because it was so rich, but delicious.   My latte was not my favorite but my buddy said the regular coffee was great and loved that they brought him a whole crave so he could refill when needed  The atmosphere was cool, hip, and re:freshing. They have large windows that open up on the side which was wonderful. Plus you could see the kitchen, which I love!   The only thing we were really bummed about was that we didn't eat here earlier in our trip so we could have multiple visits!! LOL!!   WILL RETURN FOR SURE!!!",

Exhausted after a long day of traveling, we were happy to be seated at a very comfortable high top next to the kitchen so we could watch all the action.  Everything we saw being prepared looked terrific!  We weren't real hungry though, so we opted to share the Rigatoni with Meatballs and they were kind enough to split it for us.  Nice!  And very very good!  Husband loved their Amari Manhattan, while I found a red wine to make me happy.  The real star of the show though was the amazing Date and Pistachio Cake with Bourbon Sauce and Cardamom Whipped Cream.   Yum!  The next morning we checked out Match for breakfast where Husband had their regular breakfast with his choice of scrambled eggs and bacon.  I had the avocado bacon omelette.  We were seated inside by the open windows.  Very nice.  Our last Match experience was for Happy Hour.  Husband was able to get his Amari Manhattan for three bucks off, while I was quite happy with one of their five dollar wines.    Love the ambiance of both the restaurant and bar, and Service was stellar for all three of our experiences!",

If you get Sara or Joey, you're in luck because it's hard to find waiters/waitresses with their unique personality that can connect with their customers like these 2 that night. Their sense of humor brought great joy to our meal. Sara was also nice enough to give me a surprise birthday cake, which was so delicious. Never had banana cheesecake before! Food was absolutely amazing! The deviled eggs are a must. I was very intrigued yet concerned about the black bean burger, but I feel bad for even considering not getting it. If you get soup, the eggplant soup was certainly a great choice for me!",

Stood at the unattended hostess station for a while, waited for drinks a long time, waited to put in our food order for an even longer time. The place wasn't even busy, just a few other people who also seemed irritated and forgotten. When the food finally came out, we almost asked for to go boxes because we were tired of sitting there at that point. Then trying to get someone's attention so we could ask for the check was yet another battle. Seriously ridiculous. Food was fine, but the service was absolute crap.",

Then another 15 to order and get drinks.  Things seemed to have picked up, since it took only 5 min to get out first course, but too much optimism I suspect, because it took .5 hour to get our salads...at this point we decided to get a little buzz going since we knew we were in it for the long haul  Champagne  please . We made the best of it.    Most patrons were annoyed and trying to be cool but just wanted their food.  Finally our main entree arrived!!  The prime rib was not what I was expecting but decent flavor. The potatoes au gratin were good but lukewarm at best.  The green beans were frozen maybe flash cooked...who knows...not worth $48.00 a plate!  The wait staff were stressed for sure, but nice, apologetic and patient.  We greatly appreciated this because it could have been a lot worse.  I hope and Match was only having a bad night and not a bad year.  Merry Christmas kids!  Thanks for the kindness",

He noticed my appreciation for the art and informed me of the gallery across the lounge , being as slow as it was he even offered a walking tour of some the art near by.   Being absolutely famished , I had to decline , he then led me to a warm open air dining room with a view of the nearby architecture. I proceeded to have one of the best meals , accompanied with the most friendly and down to earth service I have ever experienced. Really looking forward to going back and asking for David for sure.   This is not a hotel restaurant, this is a restaurant that happens to be attached to a hotel. Would give it 10 stars if I could.",

The place was empty, maybe because it was during the week but more room for us. Ordered a pizza, it was pretty big for one, you can share it It was a little over salted on one side but it was delicious. Loved the atmosphere and the waitress was sweet and took good care of us.

I almost skipped on this restaurant because of the low star rating, but once I put a spoon of their mushroom soup in my mouth I became thankful and grateful I didn't. I went for restaurant week - $44 special per person. They shined. There were a lot of: \"mmmmm\" noises on our table. Presentation was impeccable and portions were great. Their macaroni and cheese though needs a lot of work. It was the one tasteless thing. Also, from the beginning I told our waiter I wanted the Pineapple upside cake, which was available when we got there. This cake was set to be the highlight of the night... I wanted that cake sooo badly.... I couldn't wait.... And then when the time arrives, our waiter simply says: \" Sorry by now we run out of cake \"! That was so sad... So sad. To this day, I still think of what could have been. Yea, I'm exaggerating a bit... But I just need my moment. Ok, I'm back. In general, I do recommend this place. Besides the glitch, our server was very accommodating and cool. By the way, parking is not hard at all. They happen to be next to a parking garage that is wide open, no fees, or tolls, which is very rare for downtown. So it's easy to give it a try. Make sure they save you a piece of that Pineapple cake though:(",

I can't wait to try their food because their menu looks amazing however this was a boozing only visit (hungover...don't judge). Apparently breakfast runs til 10:30, brunch begins at 11. Hmmm. What about the twilight zone from 10:30-11? I didn't ask but did wonder to myself. You know those \"I just don't care\" moments? That was one of them. I'm sure they'll feed you if you happen to wander in during that hallucinatory time. Bonus- $10.86 for 2 damn good Bloody Marys! I'll be back to this place and I definitely recommend based on my positive bar experience.",

We will definitely come back for happy hour and stay for dinner sometime. Great ambiance and atmosphere and very nice patio area for the Phoenix \"winter\".",

Really had to put some salt, pepper and olive oil to get some taste.   Everyone else's meals looked real good but lacked taste.   Service was pretty good cept they left our dishes in front of us and brought the check. Was extremely strange to try and sign the check around all the dishes.",

Very interesting concept in the building where you order everything - including cocktails - at the register and take a seat.  Loved the $5 mimosas and bloody mary's.  The husband and son got the Father's Day hash and said it was richly loaded with beef.  I went for the Hazelnut French Toast with vanilla butter and bourbon syrup.   Oh MY what a plate of deliciousness that was.  I snarfed ut before I had a chance to take a pic.  Amazing.  The son and hubby tried it and coveted it.  (The rest of the family were fine with their yummy breakfast burritos)  I had a couple of swell mimosas to wash down that french toast which I am already trying to figure out when I can go get again!",

Tasted like a regular negrino though,  but still good.  Love the glasses they serve the beer in as well.   Parking can be difficult,  so use their valet,  which is free for two hours.

Waitress was trying to get a date/get with the manager on the floor more than she was interested in waitressing it seemed, he was trying to be professional but she was openly on the floor flirting, touching his arm his back so on... My dessert (pudding) was a brick (not cold) they tried to fix it same issue again. Food was very forgettable, salmon dip was essentially tuna salad with salmon, meatballs were half face of the sun hot half lukewarm. The bartender was a better server than the waitress and was nice and conversational when we came in, valets were great, manager did try to make it better and gave us a discount because of the 2 awful desserts and the waitress charging us incorrectly the first time she brought out our ticket. The bartender and on floor manager are the only reason they didn't get one star; they were both professional and personable and courteous. Also we were there late in the evening but they were still open for 2 more hours, the other waitress was already pulling everything off of the tables (candles, salt, etc) which made us feel rushed.",

I ordered La Tabla ($14) which is a fancy cheese plate. It was good without being excellent.   I also ordered an extremely fancy cocktail- Sailing Down the Nile which included North African Absinthe. It was wonderful and the presentation was stunning!  However, the price of $14 was hard to swallow!  Especially, since I found out that there are equally stunning Absinthe infused cocktails around Phoenix for half the price.  For dessert, I got the Valrhona Milk Chocolate Pot De Creme with Hazelnut whipped cream topping. Again, really good (just fancy chocolate pudding), but not worth the $10 price tag.  Big question: will I go back?  Probably not, even though it was a very interesting experience and I'm glad I tried it, but their prices are just too steep for what they offer.",

When we discovered it was Valet only parking it by default because we had already parked in the valet parking area when the one valet guy told us we needed to go back to the front to be serviced. He informed us that parking was complementary for 2 hours which is great.   Our server was a young lady named Sara who was EXTREMELY nice and informative! As for the food, I ordered the Buffalo Cauliflower and deviled eggs as an appetizer. The cauliflower was AMAZING! The buffalo sauce gave me the illusion of an \"airy\" aka light chicken. The goat cheese gave it a nice flavor as well and I don't really like goat cheese! For the main entree we ordered the Coconut Rum Cream Salmon and my boyfriend had the Marco Pizza which he rated a 3 out of 5. I would give my Salmon a 3 out of 5 as well. The cream that was under the rice was flavorful but the salmon itself was very bland. Once I added salt and pepper it was a little more tolerable.   For drinks I had the Spicy Peach which was really good. The spice wasn't overwhelming and it was fairly light yet strong enough to give you a little warm feeling inside. My boyfriend had the Lumberyard Diamond Down Lager which tasted like a woodsy Michelob Ultra. So you'd do better getting a Michelob Ultra.",

The deviled eggs were good but nothing special. Same with the ceviche.   We were seated on the patio, which was great. The bar area is open air. Overall cool ambience.   Our salads and entree items were a mix of hit and miss. The ribs were delicious which was surprising for this style of venue. Mushroom soup was great but we were told we were getting tortilla soup, however, mushroom appeared. The salmon was cooked well but was quite bland. The beet salad was fresh but lacked character. I didn't try it but there were mixed reviews on the chicken Thai bowl. The pizza here is awesome. They ran out of the dessert we wanted - pineapple upside down cake, so I can't review it. Instead we had banana cheesecake and chocolate peanut butter cake. Both were just ok. The cocktails were good, but again, nothing too special.   I might try this place again for happy hour but, based on my first experience, wouldn't go too far out of my way. On a positive note, the service was great despite the soup delivery mix up/items they ran out of.",

I had the spicy chicken no bun ( more bunny food please!) and my hot date has the chicken pad deconstructed pad Thai. Our server was very pleasant and came by to check on us during our meal, but allowed us to just enjoy our date night in a leisurely easy-going manner. The ambience here was really nice too! We sat in the patio seating outdoors with some fireplaces and surrounded by some sculptures and artwork. It is a really beautiful space and the food and service and drinks all Completed the look!",

We sat inside but there's quite a bit of patio seating, which looked nice depending on the weather.  Like I said I ordered the breakfast burrito and really liked it! The thing that was interesting about it was that everything in it blended together. It had eggs, potato, cheese, chorizo & pico and you can basically taste everything in every bite. Also, because of this the chorizo & cheese weren't greasy. It was a LITTLE dry and our server brought us salsa that WAS SO TASTY. Even though I had ate half my burrito by the time he brought it I used the entire cup he brought me on the half I had left.   Our server was friendly and knew the menu. However, he did bring one of my friends the completely wrong order, but she was so hungry she didn't realize it until we pointed it out to her after she had a few bites. When we pointed it out to him he acknowledged it was his mistake and without even making a fuss he just offered to give us a percent off our bill.  I'd come back!",

    "text": "It's occasions like this particular Sunday that I am reminded of how lucky and blessed I am to have had the honor of raising the daughters that I have.  I don't often get together with the four of them. They're busy with their careers, their respective families, and they seem to be always traveling. Hmmm...I wonder where they got that habit from?   It was Father's day, and I didn't have much expectation as to all of us getting together for a sit down brunch or dinner. I figured I would either just get a card, email, text, IM, VM or any of the myriad of ways that one can get a hold of me without actually being there in person. Much to my surprise, my beloved daughters had scheduled brunch for all of us, along with one of my sons-in-law at a central location - literally on Central Avenue!   I surmised that since all the planets do align themselves once in a while, why can't I have brunch with four busy, successful, and beautiful globe-trotting millennials?  Match is located at the ground floor of the FOUND:RE Phoenix Hotel. I've never stayed here, but I was told that it is quite nice and accommodating.   Nice and accommodating is definitely a great descriptor of the Match's foyer / lobby, which it shares with the hotel. It's walls adorned with striking art, and comfortable couches throughout so that one can \"lounge\" around. It's a nice place to hang out for seemingly hours on end.  Their brunch menu doesn't have a large selection. However, what they did serve was quite appetizing. I should know this by now, but most of my daughters have similar taste as us. Therefore, in spite of my suggestions to order otherwise, we somehow managed to order similar items.  French toast with bananas. Poached eggs with breakfast potatoes. Sides of buttermilk pancakes. Our brunch was absolutely delightful. The portions weren't that large, but enough to satisfy our appetites. The atmosphere was subdued, yet airy. The background music was soothing, yet upbeat.   All of this lent to an amazingly wonderful experience catching up on all of their adventures. I often just kept quiet and listened. Inwardly, I was completely elated, knowing that in the midst of our many imperfections as a parents; we still managed to raise amazing young women whom we are so very proud of.  It was such a great Father's day!",

It's right off the light rail, which is a plus.  Based on 3 visits 1 good and 2 could use improvement.   First happy hour before the game, bartender was little busy but more confused and disorganized, my sister order a chocolate martini, once we got her attention. Her drink came and was very good, I ordered a tequila on the rocks. You'd think that is simple but took about 5 minutes longer for her to pour. Please deliver drinks together especially when one is just a pour.  Friday night: bartenders was friendly, food was really good and atmosphere was on point. Not quite a party scene but a good crowd and a DJ. Great vibe just to chill.  Sat Breakfast SMH, ordered waffle, 30 minutes to come out, place was empty maybe 5-10 tables. Then it came out undercooked, bacon was nice and crispy.  Waiter came out and made a comment that they would make me a new one and not re-plate it, I'm guessing it's one of those things you say and wish you didn't.  I wouldn't do breakfast but evening crowd is a win.",

A few more minutes went by and then bar back asked if we had been helped.  We hadn't so he called someone over to take our drink order.  This bartender was so slow, talking to one of the patrons while making our two drinks.  It was three or four minutes in between drinks and he served my husband first.  My drink isn't horrible, but tastes like a store bought mix of the drink I ordered.  I did see him make it, it's just not great.    At one point there were seven workers in and around the bar, it's not even busy and we didn't get helped.    This is slightly farther away than Old Town, now I know why we go there for drinks.

Fun little plaques that represent the RE in the hotel name (i.e. the elevator is RE - lift, the door mat is RE-tread, the bathroom is RE-lief).  The floor, ceilings and walls all exhibit some type of art flair.    Then we entered MATCH.  Our maitre de/waiter, James,  greeted us by name and showed us to our table by the window.  He was friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, everything a good waiter needs to be.  I was swept away by my dinner.  Short ribs in a red wine sauce over puffy, yummy potato gnocchi.  It melted in my mouth and went perfect with my glass of wine.  Our entire party enjoyed their dinner.  My husband felt it was rather pricey but you do have the alternative of sitting at the bar for some less expensive fun choices.  And I thought my dinner was well worth the price.

They have cocktails for 6.20$, but the menu is very limited and the drinks are fairly simple and not very tasty. The best of the bunch is essentially fruity soda with alcohol in it. Their play on the caiparinha is awful regardless of the fruit they put in it. On a recent trip, the husband wanted a beer and asked the bartender if beer was on happy hour....She said it was and it was 4$ but then after pouring and serving the beer she told us she thought maybe it was no longer on hh. She then charged us full price (6$). Not cool. So if you're a beer drinker, this is not your hh. I have tried a couple of their non hh cocktails and they were alright, but not worth their 13$ price tag. I tried the play on iced Vietnamese coffee, which is oddly green, and tastes decent but didnt blow me away, and their hot coffee drink with whiskey, which was super strong....The booze totally overpowered any other flavor. As far as food goes, I really like their hh hummus (which isn't hummus at all but a celery root puree). It's served with yummy pickled veggies and Noble bread.... That's worth ordering for sure. I tried the Jamaican patties and they were alright.   The best part of this bar is the atmosphere. The hotel is cool and has interesting article throughout. The bathrooms are awesome. If this place could revamp their hh menu to include a couple tasty, crowd pleasing drinks and stop worrying so much about the 'concept' of liquors from around the world, I think they could find more success.",

    "text": "I went here on a Monday night around 8pm alone and for it being not that busy the service was painfully slow. I had the Caesar salad and the crispy Seabass. The food was adequate, but nothing amazing for the price.The girl who ran the Caesar salad out basically threw it on the table and didn't ask me if I needed any pepper or salt which was also not on the table. My waiter was nowhere to be found so I got up to the bar and found a pepper shaker while bartender paid absolutely no mind. So if you're looking for somewhere with mediocre overpriced food and lackluster service this is the spot for you. The decor is very nice and if they managed to dim the lights on the patio a little bit it would've been very pleasant to sit outside on a nice night.",

This was with a new chef, and we were stunned. How could a place that has these great ideas just fall flat? The kale salad was bitter and underprepared, and the short rib  was just...meh. On the other hand, breakfasts kept getting better. We just couldn't figure it out. Tonight, at a First Friday, we FINALLY got the whole package. Every dish was a delight (the hummus wonderful, the tiramisu nearly perfect, and the drinks were all flavorful and different). What really put us over the top was the service. Toby and Justin treated us like friends--with respect and a friendly face. Kudos to finally hitting the right notes. We'll be back very, very soon.",

It says on their website they have HH until 7, but they recently changed it to 6. They were accommodating and still have us HH prices, but I hate when places change policies and don't update their website. It feels awkward and cheap to ask for the deal. Anyways! I am a huge IPA fan and they had 2 decent ipas on their draft list. They were out of both (what?) so I ordered a bottle. Fine, I guess, but how can you not have any ipas on tap?? We ordered 2 appetizers- the vegetable skewers and the chicken wings. Both were mediocre. The patio is beautiful; has warmers and is really comfortable, but it was dead for a Friday night. I like a place with more of a buzz. The service was excellent, but besides that the place is nothing really special...",

Even though the place was mostly empty, they saw fit push tables together to seat a table of  12 right next to us. The sun was going down and shining directly in the faces of half our group through large, unshaded windows.  I found it hard to believe a Phoenix restaurant would shade east facing windows! The food was pricey and the portions were small. Even though I consider myself somewhat of a foodie, I had to look up several words/ingredients to understand the menu.  My drink was delicious, Bloom's Negroni Bianco, but it was $11 and there's no happy hour pricing on this beverage.",

    "text": "MATCH. Serves. Brunch!! MATCH, newly opened this past October, is now serving brunch by popular demand, and just started this past January. I cruised in with my friends and was excited to try this night spot transformed into day spot.  The ambience of Match is still the same, it's trendy with colorful art littering the walls, and a sleek, simple but balanced, darker aesthetic complimented by big airy windows. It's not summer yet in Phoenix, so why not sit by the window? We definitely did. The brunch has a $27 deal that includes a bottle of champagne and OJ each- our waitress said it comes out to 5-6 drinks depending! Not bad for brunch! While we passed on this, we gladly ordered some Bloody Mary's made from their own special house mix and lattes by local Press Coffee. The fresh-pressed juices by Karma Juice also looked delicious, but many of them were sadly sold out when we were there. Overall, their beverage game was on point! Our server, Amy, was friendly and delightful, warning us that the quiches were so popular that there were only two left! Well, we obviously had to rescue them. So we ordered the last two \"Don't Quiche Me on the Mouth\" quiches and the Filipino Chile Relleno.  I am Filipino, and I always tell those who are not used to Filipino food, that the cuisine is an acquired taste. I was skeptical to try a childhood favorite with a twist- longanisa (Filipino breakfast sausage), but when I tried it, I think my childhood self yipped in joy! I would never ever have the guts to put a twist on a Filipino staple, especially because my mom would probably disown me if I did, and I have tasted many 'Filipino dishes with a twist' that have failed my taste test- but the dish had a spicy kick, and mixed with the cotija cheese, it was perfect. My best friend, who is also Filipino, took a bite and his eyes rolled in the back of his head! Safe to say- this dish is Filipino approved!  The quiches also tasted delicious were two inch high in thickness, stuffed with natural ingredients. Thumbelina could have lived in there and been good for life. By the time we were done with our entrees we were stuffed, but split the Oaxacan Wreckage for desert. When it came out, it looked so beautiful I didn't want to destroy it with my fork. The almond crumble was a perfect edition to the mole mousse. I will warn that this is not for the faint of heart or the diabetic- if you have a sweet tooth and are craving chocolate, this will definitely hit the spot.  All in all, I was impressed by the diverse menu. The Filipino Chile Relleno is creative and brings Filipino culture to Phoenix- something I can say I am very happy about, but it is not the only dish there exhibiting culinary creativity. The staff was also super amiable, and I can't wait to come back- day or night!",

    "text": "Overall, I think that perhaps Match just isn't best suited for larger groups, judging by the better reviews here. Food is alright, service is all over the place.   We had a reservation for a group of about 15. Mind you, this was on a Friday at 6pm, so it was understandably busy. We do company leader outings here and there, mostly in the Kierland area, and are not a group of picky people by any means, but this experience felt noteworthy.  Seating:  Half of our reserved area was the living room-style area, and the other half was a long dining table. Other walk in guests were sitting at our table for a good 45 minutes before we were able to sit there. We ended up squeezing all 15 or so of us in to the table, literally sitting hip to hip, since we planned to order dinner as well. Again, great environment for maybe a small group or a couple, but not the best for a larger get-together. Especially when you're trying to eat your dinner off a knee high coffee table. When you reserve, be specific about the area you need for your group.  Service: Our initial waitress was a very nice woman. The manager also greeted us to apologize for the table being used while our reservations signs were still up. However, another waitress came by to take our drink order roughly 40 minutes after getting the drink menu we had to ask for. She was very irritated with us and everyone else, and made no effort to hide it. Seeing as this was her first interaction with us, I'm not sure why she was so visibly irritated. It took over an hour to get water, which we all found very bizarre. When we told our initial waitress of the other waitress, she told us, and I quote, \"Yeah, she's losing her sh*t.\" We began to joke that maybe this place had just recently opened?  Food: The food was decent. I'm no food critic by any means, but when you advertise \"Korean BBQ Ribs\" and bring out a salad with 4 medallion sized dry ribs, it leaves one to wonder what's going on. Our Divisional Vice President ordered wings thinking it was a safe bet. 3 seemingly undercooked wings came out. For $10? 3 wings? Luckily she's lighthearted and laughed it off. Someone else ordered a burger and asked if it was the AZ burger. The runner said \"I'm not sure, this is my 3rd day.\" Fair enough - bless her heart. But the better answer would be \"I'm not sure, let me double check for you.\" (It's the only burger on the menu, but neither of them knew that at the time.) The burger was ordered medium, but came out pink all the way to the outside. I ordered the Barrueta Pizza, but received the Spicy Calabrese Pizza. I was told this was what I ordered, so I shut up and ate it. It was actually delicious! I also enjoyed the Jamaican Beef Patties. We kept getting random orders of fries, which nobody should ever complain about. However, I will note that one batch was scalding hot while another was literally chilled.   Positives: Cool lobby with an interactive projection on the floor. Sweet picture of Tom Selleck? that cracked me up for most of the night. I'm a fan of the food I got, but felt bad for everyone else. Any-gender bathrooms were a very cool thing to see, despite the overflowed trash and lack of paper towels. Sorry Match :(",

We made eye contact with the bartender with the cheapest ugly wig and she never even said \"hello sorry I'll be with you soon\" Ridiculous! Even after my father complained about the service she didn't even say I'm sorry. She just starred at him. She needs to be fired soon. The hotel is great but don't sit at the bar for a drink.

    "text": "For the first time in my 63 years, I sent an entree plate back to the kitchen untouched. It was First Friday and we had been sitting at home all week. So on Thursday, I made a reservation for Match at 6:45 p.m. for Friday for a date night out at someplace new. We arrive and we are seated immediately at a two-top near the center of the room. We immediately notice that it is dark and the music is LOUD...like nightclub dancefloor loud. We also notice that the dining room is only about 30% occupied at the peak hour of a First Friday...hmmm. The music is so loud that we cannot have any conversation between us. The server comes up to the table and is talking to us. I know he is talking because his lips are moving. I think that I hear \"tonight's special...octopus...beans.\" We look at each other and shrug and look the menu over. We order the celery root hummus, two small Match salads and two Plato Paisa entrees which is noted as \"featured steak, chicharron, avocado, fried egg...\" Obviously, it's a take on Bandeja Paisa, a culinary specialty of Columbia. I ask what the \"featured steak\" is and was told \"flat iron.\" Okay, not my favorite cut, but as Match is touted as high-quality cuisine and Plato Paisa is the highest price entree item at $29, I took the chance and ordered it medium-rare; ditto my significant other. As we finished the order, the server asked if we wanted the salads with the entree. I said, \"no, pace this, don't rush the food, appetizer, then salads, then entree.\" The celery root hummus appetizer arrives. As noted in other reviews, it is delicious and the portion is ample. However, it is served with four small/medium pieces of bread (yes, it's Noble Bread bread) and there are long stalks of roasted broccolini laying in it. (What are you supposed to do with the broccolini?) We ate up the four pieces of bread and called the server over. Can we get more bread? Sure was the answer; there's a $2 upcharge. Oh, okay, whatever, sure. He turned from the table and immediately came a runner with the salads. (This is pacing?) The asked-for bread never arrived. Salads were tasty. We were only halfway through when another runner rushed up. The entrees. (This is pacing?) I look down at my plate and think \"where's the beef?\" There's one grayish piece of something smaller than a credit card with a finger-width vein of solid gristle through it. I look across the table at my SO and see that he has thrown his napkin atop his plate and I hear, \"I'm not eating that, it stinks, and where's the steak.\" His portion of flat iron is presented sliced but is as small as my portion. We call the server over. I ask what the portion size of the steak is to be. He says, \"six ounces.\" I say, \"does that look like six ounces?\" He says, \"would you like to talk to my manager?\" I say, \"yes.\" So, the manager arrives at the table. She appears to put on a good act like she cares and is listening. I ask, \"does that look like six ounces?\" and point out the thick vein of gristle. She says no and, seemingly by rote, asks if we would like something else from the menu. Our answer is no, just the check and get us out of here. I pay the check, tip the server generously and we head across Portland to Fez because we still haven't had dinner. Fez is slammed and they are waiting eight deep inside the door because it's First Friday. (hmmm.) I want to emphasize that in 63 years I have never refused an entree plate. I have eaten a wide variety of food in a wide variety of locations in a wide variety of service, everything from stewed goat squatting around an open fire in Kibera to Dinner by Heston Blumenthal in London to street food on the beach in Patong. I have never ever refused a service...until Match on this past Friday. The entrees were not on our bill, points for that, but ultimately my opinion is that the people at the top of this restaurant don't care and don't get it.",

He couldn't even correct them after the first try.  It took 3 tries on each check to finally get them right.  The place was not overly busy.  We were sure 2 hours would be enough time since we do this quite often.  We barely made it to the show just 2 blocks away.",

Good food and good drinks.  You need them all.  The staff is all gone, so is the service.  The current bar staff does not know what service is.  They are not knowledgeable of the product.  They don't know the wines.  They look sloppy, not sharp.  The bar is over staffed to the point of bad service because they have no focus.  There is no personal interaction.  If this was a stand alone bar it would be shuttered in a few month.  Get it together and don't waste the uniqueness.",

This completely renovated former Best Western in now FOUND:RE hotel, art gallery, restaurant and lounge.  The restaurant is chic industrial design. All of the building that we saw is gorgeous, very modern and fun. All of the windows in the restaurant slide open to let in the great weather and there is great outdoor seating on both sides, one side being a pool.  Inside next to the bar is a large comfy seating/conversation area.   The hostess and the waitress (Hey, Missy!) were just lovely.  The food!! I had a wild mushroom flatbread and it was out of this world.  My friend had a luscious kale salad. We both enjoyed an Arizona wine, Provisioner White.  We told the hostess how much we liked the food and the next thing you know the owner of the hotel and the Chef, Alex Stratta, bring out samples of other flat breads which were all completely delicious! Chef Alex chatted with us. He was very charming.   This place has got it going on all over the place.  DO NOT MISS IT!",

    "text": "Thought we would go out for Christmas day dinner, what a bad idea that was! We had a reservation at 5:00, and were seated by the hostess and she gave us water. at 5:30, our waitress came to take our order.  At 6:00, I asked the hostess about our meal and to refill our waters, and a beer for my mother-in-law, and was informed the first course was on its way. At 6:20, I noticed some people that had arrived well after us were eating the same meal we had ordered and got their desserts, paid, and left. We finally got the cheese ball and it was nothing special. The bread was cold and soggy.  The waitress apologized (though we'd only seen her twice) and offered to buy drinks for the table, the drinks did not arrive until 7:00, which was the third time we saw our waitress. Between 7-7:30, I bugged the hostess 3 more times until our salads arrived and were disappointing. It was 200 dried cranberries on a plate, a few pieces of romaine on top, three crumbles of feta cheese (the menu said queso fresca), and a glob of dressing in the middle and a single pecan. The main course arrived at 8:15 and it was more disappointing than the salad.  The veggie was supposed to be roasted Caulilini, but it was frozen green beans instead. The half frozen Au Gratin potatoes were disgusting. The prime rib was terrible. My piece was cold.  My wife's piece was 85% fat, and cold.  I gave mine to my wife so she could eat.  We did not wait for desert. The entire experience lasted 3 hours and 15 minutes.  We noticed other people also did not pay for their meals that evening.  This place was run by people who have no business being in a restaurant.  We will never go to this restaurant again, or tell anybody to try it.",

    "text": "Sorry, Match. You don't light my fire.  Met some friends here for dinner and drinks on a weekday. Don't bother trying to find parking on the street- it's not worth driving around the one way streets since they offer 2 hours of free parking at the hotel. Guess they don't want you to linger since they charge $10 after that. The artwork inside is great, the patio is lovely, and the staff so friendly that I might be tempted to hang out all evening, except that the food and drinks are a miss.  If you go expecting to test out some of the exciting-sounding cocktails on the website menu, you'll be disappointed to know they don't actually serve those in the restaurant. Perhaps the website is just not updated? Too bad. I tried the Spanish gin and tonic (mostly ice, but gin/tonic/some spices/hint of citrus) and the aperol spritz (mostly ice, club soda, just a bit of aperol and sparkling wine). I don't plan to return, but would recommend sticking to wine if you visit.  The menu sounded amazing- so many options it was hard to choose. Unfortunately, there was nothing that I would order again.  - The mushroom pizza was served on a thin crust and desperately needed some seasoning. If there was onion and garlic as the menu promised, I couldn't taste it. - Daily risotto was supposedly flavored with roasted and sweet corn, but it didn't have any smokey or sweet flavor that I could detect. - The large match salad was on the small side. The ingredients were good (love the pichuberries!), but the poor thing was drowning in dressing. My bad for not requesting it on the side. I added the tuna for an upcharge and, though cooked perfectly, the seared crust lacked flavor. - We ordered a side of roasted potatoes that tasted like oil, not the promised black garlic and garden herbs. It left a bad taste in my mouth and between 5 of us, we couldn't finish it.   Overall, I wish there was something, anything, on the menu that I liked because the patio is perfect for Arizona weather. Sadly, I don't think I'll be back.",

    "text": "What a HUGE disappointment!!! I was drawn to this restaurant because of the unique menu. Ask any Filipino - you read \"filipino\" anything on a menu from a beautiful restaurant categorized as \"American (new)\", you're immediately interested.  So off hubby and I went on a Monday late afternoon around 4:30p. We turn right into the street and find a parking lot reserved for valet. Where the hell is the valet guy? We definitely missed him which is on Central. We walk to the restaurant on the left - and it was beautiful, but surprisingly big and empty. There were probably 6 customers. We wait for the hostess who by the way is absent for a few minutes. She finally gives us menus and tells us to seat ourselves. We decide on the patio- again, the patio is nice.... we wait and we wait for someone to acknowledge us. When we are finally greeted, I ask the waiter for a dinner menu as we were only given a hh and a cocktail menu. He tells us they aren't serving dinner - not until 5p. Okay...I've never heard of a restaurant to only serve HH items which by the way had only 4 or 5 food items. I also asked the waiter for a recommendation on a sweet cocktail and he suggested the Caiprinha- it was strong and awful!! Not sweet at all!! I realized our waiter is the bartender as well so service was sooooo damn slow. I counted about six employees around this big restaurant and six or seven customers so why the slow service? I don't get it. Not only that, our  waiter wasn't nice at all. He had a snotty attitude that after getting our drinks and placing our appetizer order of the samosas and hummus, we were planning to leave but honestly I wanted to wait a few minutes and see if we can get dinner menus and try the \"Filipino\" food items. That's why I came in the first place.  We finally received the hummus and samosas. The hummus was good but a little too salty. I've read other reviews on how salty some of their entrees are. Maybe they should lay off the salt a little bit. The vegetables in the hummus was delicious and the samosas were spicy and pretty good. When 5:10p hit, we were given dinner menus and I decided to order the escargot and the Filipino kush pizza. The escargot was ok - left a nasty aftertaste and the Filipino Kush pizza wasn't good. I am definitely familiar with longanisa - one of my favorite sausages of all time but with the pizza, not so much.  I was literally ready to get outta here - I wasn't very happy. The waiter didn't even notice that I only took a few sips of my cocktail - I mean that really says a lot. Even my husband's cocktail - the alpaca was barely touched. We asked for the check and left quickly. The price for disappointment (including tips): a little over $60.",

I had the lobster bisque which for me was too rich and earthy and lacked what you'd expect, the hint or taste of lobster. The wood fired gnocchi and mushrooms completely ruled this dish and not in a good way.    For the entree I tried one of their specials, a sous vide bone in pork chop over a bed of pineapple infused rice. The presentation was beautiful but the pork on its own, while very tender, lacked seasoning and flavor.  The rice with small chunks of pineapple and a house made pineapple vinegarette was decent but didn't knock my socks off.  It looked a lot better than it tasted honestly.    We tried a couple of the pizza's as well and they were just OK.   The service was good, except that we asked for the the check and they brought it with my plate of food still sitting in front of me, we hung out for about 20 minutes after to finish our cocktails and the plate never got picked up, nobody asked if we wanted to take it to go (which I didn't), but it's hard to sign the check with a big plate of food sitting in front of you when the meal is clearly over.   The space is very cool, I'd definitely come back for cocktails in the lounge area but I probably won't eat here again.",

Fries were soggy,  and I ate around a handful,  or seven and bartender had asked earlier how I found them- \"ok,\" I said.  \"Just ok?\"  \"They're too soggy.\"  He came around again,  and I'd already stopped eating them by that time.  He looked at me, then at the frites, and then looked at me again, and I said they were too soggy to enjoy.  He lifted and felt around three of them and agreed they \"shouldn't be that soggy\" and offered to get something else prepared for me.  I said it's alright,  I don't want to impose,  and he said he wouldn't mind getting something else made,  so we discussed a few options, and I went with the Green beans with crispy pork belly.  He asked if I wanted to keep the frites.  (Umm, no.  You touched a few of them!  I thought these words, but didn't say them out loud.)  \"No, it's ok. You can take them away.\"  While I waited for the green beans, the Jamaican patties arrived.  Two pieces for $6.20.  Glad I tried these during hh, because regular price is $10!  They were tasty and empanada-style-- the habanero kick was pleasing, but they were very pricey for the portion size.  The green beans arrived, and they were good, albeit very salty.  The crispy pork belly was a nice touch, but added even MORE salt to the already salty and greasy beans.  Wasn't impressed so far- had to skip on alcoholic beverages due to being on antibiotics- and then I received my bill... The cost of the frites was deducted,  and I was charged $6.20 each for the patties and the beans.  What??  I didn't speak up, I just paid and left a 20% tip (too much, I know).  Hey, other places would have either deducted the frites charge and not charge me for the beans, or at the very least left the lesser charge to cover the beans.  I wonder, if I was silly enough to keep the contaminated frites, would I have been charged for those, too?    Was looking forward to a great visit, with so many friends writing about their lovely experiences here.   (Maybe brunch time is better? ) Too bad, because the atmosphere of this boutique hotel and bar seemed nice.  :(",

    "text": "(Lyrics - Sam Smith - Latch)  You lift my heart up  When my appetite is down You, you enchant me, with your beautiful restaurant If there cocktails, I will try to knock them down I'm Matching with Yelp Now I know what I have found  I came here thinking of the website <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmatch.com&s=5a7ad17eb3943c81dac85ae79b9c0c050694769f0de09ef7d94e7ed56fd99c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">match.com</a> and by no means does the word match made me think of the literal fire stick!?  Talk about great branding!  I came here on a Saturday afternoon before the wine festival.  The restaurant is beautifully laid out and the artwork was popping!  It was pretty quiet day from what I gathered but we carried on!  We started with some drinks; my partner ordered the bloody mary while I'm shot for some whiskey.  The bartender was very helpful to pick out one for my taste buds.  Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed!    For the food we both decided to share the Lace Pancakes and Plato Paisa; grilled steak, plantains, crispy chicharoon sausage, avocado, black beans, crema, and fried egg.  Overall, the dish was plated beautifully!  You definitely had to mix the plate of ingredients together to make the flavors pop out!  I'm weird so I eat my ingredients all at once; one at a time, and that's my problem!  We ordered the steak rare and it came pretty much well done.  The egg was cooked over easy as requested.  My favorite bite of the dish was probably the sausage since it had some heat and pop; while the avocado and black bean provided some welcoming texture.  The plantains were perfectly cooked and added a dessert like ending to my entree.  The Lace Pancakes had roasted apples, maple syrup, cardamom whipped cream, and smoked almond crumble.  My thoughts, it was just an apple crisp crepe and tasted like one too.  Don't get me wrong I rather enjoyed it.  In the end, the place is wonderful and well located!  The service was not lacking any where!  I guess I had higher expectations for this place and I was somewhat disappointed.  I thought the food was okay, but nothing spectacular and though the names of the dishes were extravagant; the taste didn't follow suit.  Needless to say, I would still come back because the atmosphere seemed awesome and the service was tops! - Enjoy!",

    "text": "I too was one of the unfortunate that chose Match for our Christmas Dinner.  As we were staying at the hotel we figured this would be easiest and most of the reviews were fairly positive.   What a disaster,  no one came to our table (other than the hostess who gave us water) for at least 20 minutes.  From cocktails to appetizer to salad we had wasted over an hour and a half waiting for our main courses.  They kept bringing us the wrong courses and the wrong items.  We decided we could not take it anymore and left before the entree and dessert.  We discussed our dissatisfaction with what I think was the manager,  perhaps this is Daniel.  He was very arrogant and unapologetic.    The next day, I asked for a restaurant representative , who unfortunately, was the same unpleasant individual I spoke with the night before.  If this is Daniel, mentioned positively in a previous review, I had a completely different experience.  He told me that I was trying to get something for nothing but nothing for nothing is pretty much what I got.  As I was staying in one of the hotels nicest suites, I was not at this establishment to get  a couple of free drinks along with bad appetizers and salads.   I am not sure what I did to get his reaction but he was once again, very arrogant, looking down on me like my opinion had no value to him.  Later that day I spoke with the hotel's general manager who was very nice an apologetic.  Based on his behavior toward me and my friend on the Christmas dinner and the next day, the restaurant manager should not be dealing with the public.  Perhaps he is better in the back of the house because his people skills are highly deficient.",

I tried all the dishes they offered us and I do not have anything bad to say so I can not wait until I come back for brunch. My favorite dish that I did try was the octopus a la plancha! I was hesitant because I've never had octopus but I am so glad I did it was absolutely delicious. It will be a great visit even you hang out at the bar like I mentioned very nice decor throughout.",

No guilt because it's heaven, and everyone knows the greatest miracle of all is having permission to commit the greatest sin of all: gluttony.

Pretty dead for a Saturday afternoon but we took advantage of the available window seating and I ordered myself a Bloody Mary. It was one of the better bloodies that I've had in a while. I find a lot of times the mix is too thick and not fresh. This one was perfectly refreshing and on the lighter side.   For brunch I ordered the lace pancakes served with wood oven roasted apples, bourbon barrel aged maple syrup, and cardamom whipped cream. The apples were slightly more firm than apple pie- and added a great texture to the delicate dish. Just a heads up, the pancakes are more like crepes and not actual pancakes. They're thin and flaky, served rolled up. We also got the Plato Paisa {steak | plantains | chicharron | longanisa sausage | avocado | black beans | crema | fried eggs} as you can tell, it was a hodgepodge of different things meant to be eaten together. The sausage was the real stand out of this dish. Overall, everything we had was good, but didn't blow me away. Hence the four stars. I plan to go back and try their other menus to see what they have to offer!",

The food is primarily locally sourced, including an amazing selection of local wines. I selected the award winning  Pillsbury Vineyard of Cottonwood, AZ...a crisp white wine that was very good.  Food is somewhat family style. We picked the lamb meatballs, a delicious Papaya salad, Bombay samosa, Marrakesh Tinga, and Match Poki. We loved our selections. The service was A plus.

Despite this we had to basically light ourselves on fire to get the attention of anyone in the restaurant, it took a full half hour to get drinks and an hour to get food. Our friend ordered a medium rare steak that was completely charred throughout, nicely returned it and then got to watch the kitchen staff in the open concept kitchen talk about how a completely brown steak is apparently medium rare now, apparently forgetting that the kitchen is fully exposed to the dining room and there was no one in the restaurant. Another friends chicken was half pink inside. After this we asked to split the check a few ways and waited another 30 minutes while the staff acted like we asked them to write a PHD dissertation in astrophysics. Another friend walked by the staff blatantly complaining about splitting the check, again with the self awareness of a toddler. At this point our friend with the burnt \"steak\" just asked to pay the entire bill so we could leave. The excuse we got was our waiter was \"still learning\", which I guess I'll need to save in the future for when I'm doing a bad job at my own job",

    "text": "The good news is that Match is not the stereotypical hotel dining room type of restaurant. You know, those places that charge 5-star prices but make you wish you decided to go to McDonald's instead? What Match has going for it is a sparse but interesting menu that looks and tastes good and is surprisingly reasonably prices considering the hotel it's in is walking distance to exactly only one other restaurant (Fez across the street).  So having a captive audience does that mean they have to try harder or not try as much?  I ate there twice, once for dinner on a Saturday night and again for brunch on Sunday morning.  We were staying at the hotel (a staycation - reviewed separately) and purposely chose to eat at Match despite having plans to go downtown for an event later that evening.  Match is relatively casual and informal with pretensions that it's \"all that\".  They breathlessly advise you to make reservations because they tout themselves as the \"busiest restaurant in Phoenix\" or something like that.  Well at about 7 PM on a Saturday night the place was about 70% empty. Yet the pretension continued when we walked up to the desk without reservations and got that \"OH! You don't have reservations. I'll see if we can find a table for you\". HUH?  What about all those empty ones over there?  Whatever.  So they \"found\" us a table. I had chicken because I had a taste for it. It was basically the piece of meat with some stuff scattered around it. It was a dichotomy - dry and tough but really tasty.  KFC won't have to worry about the competition. My dining companion had a Cobb salad that was pretty big and loaded. We both had a chilled avocado/melon soup that was remarkably good.  The next morning we both had Salmon Benedict. It wasn't bad (I mean how bad can you screw up poached eggs over an English muffin?).  The poached eggs were kinda bizarre though, big white puffy perfectly round mounds ... two of them, like Hostess Sno Balls. They were just too perfect looking, like they were mass produced.  The salmon (lox) wasn't the most flavorful but it was okay. But for whatever reason the eggs were served on the same plate as a green side salad with Italian dressing on it.  Weird.  What keeps Match from being outstanding are the people who work there. After being open for 10 months they still seemed to be dazed and confused like it was opening day, either not knowing or not caring what they were serving. For example the server asking what style of eggs I want for the Eggs Benedict ... um, sweetie, if the eggs aren't poached it's not really a Benedict, is it?  The nail in the coffin was the \"open\" kitchen, which must have sounded to the owners like a great idea. But not when you can hear the chefs arguing about how much to \"upcharge\" a customer for a substitution. Cringeworthy!  They seriously need a manager on duty to whip this staff into shape.",

    "text": "An excellent choice for dinner at the Found:re Hotel!  We have lived in Phoenix since 2000 and had used this hotel when it was under different ownership and brand names. We had not been here in several years and learned about its changes, upgrades and links to the Phoenix Art Museum.  We enjoyed the Scottish Salmon and a pasta dish, and both were excellent. The service staff was attentive and the manager stopped by to welcome us. The decor is very unique and not at all plain or ordinary. The value for the meals is reasonable, as evidenced by the fact the restaurant (and hotel) was full on Christmas. (We were there 2 days later)  This attention to detail does not happen often enough or by accident. We compliment the Found:re Hotel management and ownership for their positive change in direction.",

It came with an arugula salad that had some sour cream looking dressing and radishes. The salad was way too salty and that's coming from someone who loves salt. They had a station where you get up and get yourself coffee. It was a bit deceiving because it seemed that it would be free but wasn't. Why have a station for coffee if you'll charge? Then you might as well get it for me in standard waiter practice. In short, it was good but I wasn't impressed.  Dinner was a different story. I had the pina moscow mule which was tasty and the garlic shrimp with pasta. Though small, it was a plate to remember. I would recommend dinner here! It is pricey but the ambiance on the outside patio makes it well worth it.",

It took a few minutes to be acknowledged, which was by the hostess after she was off the phone. But there were servers and bartenders who just were chatting at the bar. We sat on the patio. The structure is amazing, lots of steel! The inside decor is unique showcasing bottles of wine and eccentric paintings.  We got the cosmo and Moscow mule. Both were tasty and quite strong (not complaining). We got the hummus, veggie skewers and flatbread pizza. The pizza was a little soggy, nothing to write home about. The veggies skewers were Ahhhmazing! The pesto sauce seriously so so good! The hummus was interesting! Lots of mixture of veggies but again very tasty! We rode our bikes and I wish there was more bike parking nearby. There was only bike parking at fez and the racks were crowded.",

(2 hours validation for parking at hotel if you dine in) Honestly the bartender was working really hard and I think he was a nice guy. He was by himself working the bar, serving around 12 customers. Pineapple wheat beer and their spritzer that tasted like a fancy dirty shirley were great. Pimm's cup was really sour. Not bad but my friends didn't like it. Definitely to sweet. I'm getting too old for cocktails.   We were denied service when my 22 year old friend showed a vertical drivers license that doesn't expire until the end of the year. **Note HB-2031 bill allows OUT OF STATE vertical ID cards to be accepted. * it's been in effect since 2016 because many out of state tourists couldn't even enjoy a drink because their new licenses have yet to be issued. The bartender asked his manager and she/he said no. The bartender said he didn't want to lose his job because we could be undercover cops. So we left. We looked up the vertical ID Law and saw the bill to allow put of state people to get alcohol with a vertical ID. My boyfriend informed management. We wanted to still get our drinks so we went back down. And the management had STILL not informed her bartender. So when we went down we had to wait form him to get permission from his manager.   It was just a very unfortunate situation with the staff being more concerned with saving their own butts than actually knowing the current laws. It would have been nice if management had at least informed staff of the new information that had been shared with her.",

Presentation was absolutely divine and we absolutely enjoyed every bite.  Despite his celebrity status, Chef Alex has remained humble and approachable throughout his years and tenure at some of the country's and state's finest restaurants. It is truly a pleasure to have tasted his cuisine here at Match for the first time. Thank you for a most memorable evening. Match will most probably become my new favorite restaurant in town.

My boyfriend took a bite of his burrito, looked at me, gave me a slow nod in approval, and whispered/sang \"MoneyYyYy\"- so it must be good. Two complaints- first, the toast was so hard, my jaw cracked every time I chewed. Second, the coffee was awful. AWFUL. Get a specialized drink instead.",

She is a wonderful Ambassador for your Brand and gave us the whole art tour as it was off hours for Match. That and a great thumbnail overview of the menu offerings. A very genuine person.  Today we returned and in the parking lot we were greeted by Jerome who could not have been more accommodating for several reasons.  He should be acknowledged. By the time we departed he was no longer on site, otherwise we we had planned to acknowledge him.  Once inside Match, it was like the air had been let out of the Staff and there was no greet so we sat our selves.  We believe the restaurant wants to be high end, yet it is not yet quite there.  Will not detail the utter disappointment in the experience, save for Match's Director of F&B, Brian Blanke, who caught wind of the less than stellar experience and absence of TLC while we attempted to dine.   He, too, could not have been more genuine.  He was truly dismayed by what did not happen for us and showed it.   So we are no longer dismayed and will be returning soon, as places like the FoundRE & Match in Phx are far, far and few between.",

We were a group of about ten women and we had a wonderful time. We felt comfortable enough to stay for a few hours and enjoy our time.   When you look at the menu, you can see that the purpose of the restaurant is more than just serving food and drinks. I can't imagine the thought, skill, and creativity that went in to each cocktail and food item.  Everything we ordered was delicious and felt like a personal experience rather than just eating and drinking.  Each item was unique and included authentic ingredients.  I spent time living in Japan, and a lot of the restaurants there create a food experience that encourages its customers to enjoy every bite.  This restaurant gave me that same experience, and I was so thankful. We tend to just shovel food in here in America, without much thought or consideration to the flavor of each bite.     The service here is phenomenal.  The staff was attentive, friendly, and personable. Through our entire dining experience, the service was warm and friendly. My friend had been to Match the night before and mentioned to the staff that she was planning on having her birthday dinner there the next night.  At the end of our meal the staff surprised her with a beautiful handmade cake!!! And it was SO good. One of the best cakes I've ever had.       I'm thankful to have found such a great place. I can't wait to try more of the unique items on the menu!",

The staff are extremely professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. A Perfect place to go when hitting up downtown Phoenix. This will be one of our regular places we go to from now on.",

The food portions were incredibly small -- we got the cous cous with salmon and had to order additional food. we also got a salad with tuna - the tuna was SUPER salty, making the last pieces inedible. its certainly a cool room, but the food is struggling.",

    "text": "This is a very well conceived restaurant and adjoining cocktail bar with plenty of outdoor seating.  The atmosphere is great, and the decor is excellently put together.  We went for dinner and shared a couple of plates along with a lovely bottle of wine.  The wine list is fairly diverse but not overwhelming.  The dishes we ordered were wonderfully prepared and quite tasty.  We had the gnocchi with meatballs (odd combination - but it really does work) and one of the specials - which I can neither pronounce nor spell.  And one of the most refreshing things about the menu was the variety and diversity of different options - while still remaining somewhat streamlined.  One of my biggest gripes about many of the new restaurant openings in the Valley is the minimization of the menu coupled with a lack of variety.  Match solves that problem perfectly.  And they do it in a very tasty way!!",

They spent time and money to do this place right, and it shows. We went Friday night for dinner and returned Saturday for drinks and had a top notch experience both nights. I will be a regular at Match!",
