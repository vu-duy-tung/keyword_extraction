    "text": "As did others we drove by the first time but the two room cafe lived up to its best Mexican restaurant rating for the past five years by the AZ Republic.  During the day the guacamole with olive oil, vinegar, onions, cilantro & pomegranate seeds is not made at the table and includes delicious (not calorie free) topopos (round, fried chip like tortillas). For a side salad we had an unusually tasty spinach salad with a hint of sweet & spicy vinaigrette and toasted pecans, roquefort, apples and slow roasted tomatoes. For the entre we had  Enchiladas Suizas (Mexico City style) with chicken and tomatillo cream sauce which fit our mild taste buds.  Cafe Barrio is a step up in a culinary experience from our usual default Mexican restaurant of choice, (i.e., Macayos)  and would definitely be worth a repeat in the future.",

    "text": "My co-workers and I went to Barrio Cafe to celebrate our boss' birthday.  We were very dissappointed.  Thought the food was ok, the service was HORRIBLE.  From the beginning, the waiter appeared as if though we were bothering him and wished we werent there.  I have never eaten at a location where the waiter only gives water to the guests and never bothers to take a drink order.  The food order took a ridiculous amount of time.  ALL of the tables that were around us that were seated AFTER we had ordered, were finised with their meal before we were even served ours.  When we asked the waiter about our order, he very rudely informed us that our food would be served when it was done.  WOW, that is some amazing customer service.  We asked to speak to the manager but that did not do anything.  When our food was being served, the waiter informed us that our food took exactly 23 minutes, though it had been 1 hour since we had ordered.  Nice to know that the waiter waited 40 minutes to put in our order and no, we did not order any appetizers.  Needless to say, I will never return to this restaurant.  I would much rather eat at the local Ranch Market than return to Barrio Cafe.  It is unfortunate because I really wanted to like this place.    The food was OK but not anything that WOWed me enough to return after such horrible service.  We all honestly thought we were in one of those hidden camera shows like \"Boiling Points\" because he was sure pushing it.    It would have also been nice to have been informed of the $1 per person plate charge for our cake that we brought in.  He could have at least cut and served the cake for that price.  All he did was bring us plates but did not provide us with a knife or anything.  I would NOT recommend Barrio Cafe to anyone, much less a group of more than 2.",

This is good and bad: good, because I realize, as hordes of other people do, that this is some of the most innovative Mexican food in town; bad, because tonight I realized the in-crowd often is, in its lust for a good meal, downright rude. One set of patrons muscled its way to the front of the line as the restaurant geared up for its 5 p.m. Saturday opening. I mean, really, just get in line. Then, once we were dining, we noticed another set of patrons coming in the back door and just seating themselves at an empty table. The waitperson, to her credit, remained polite toward them. Sigh, I'm trying a week night next time ...",

    "text": "My \"foodie friend\" insisted I try this place and has been talking about it for a very long time! We went today. I had to park in the back which is surrounded by an unsavory residential area. So parking was my first concern. The restaurant inside was quaint and nice. For such a highly acclaimed restaurant, I wasn't at all impressed with the service. I was not greeted. Since I was meeting my friend, I decided to just look around myself. I understand that this is not an On The Border or \"traditional\" Mexican food as soon as I open the menu. Unfortunately, that's the kind of Mexican food that I like! No chips and salsa. Isn't that a staple at any Mexican restaurant? They served bread, which wasn't even good. Very basic bread like what you could purchase at Basha's and some type of chili/tomatoe spread. I skipped that. We ordered guacamole which was awesome. Too bad the chips they served were so dry and bland. Again, in my opinion the guacamole would have been so much better on the thin salty chips that I am used to! I was starving so I decided to get adventurous and order something that sounded somewhat familiar. I ordered what I thought would be a simple chicken enchilada. It was a mole sauce, which I had never tried before. Not a fan. I had just a couple bites. This \"mexican bitter chocolate\" sauce had no place on food at all, but I've heard a lot of great things about it, so maybe it's just my personal taste. My friend's pulled pork was delicious, had a couple bites of that. I've obviously realized by now that this is Mexico City type food and not traditional \"beans and rice, chips and salsa\" type food. The meal was served with a side of very soggy vegetables-again, not typical vegetables that you would even want to eat, so I didn't understand that either.Is this a side? Is it a garnish? Is this creative? What the F I am hungry!! I had a bite of what I think was zuchini. It was almost like they were soaked in oil and steamed. I would have loved to have spotted and better yet tasted anywhere in anything we ordered some cilantro, some green onion, but no such luck! Again, I realize that a lot of people probably love this restaurant. Just putting my review out there to help those who have not been be aware of what kind of experience they might have. I would never go there again.",

Close your eyes and take a bite...that feeling, taste, all of it is not eating but an experience. Open your eyes & there is music, conversation, art, it is a barrio. This is the neighborhood cafe. I've been a semi-regular since they opened. A fellow Yelp'er & myself came across an ad in a now defunct magazine & we had to check it out. Being Mexican & always on the hunt for good Mexican food, not that water down stuff sold all throughout the state, we gave it a go. I would have given it a 5 star review as I ate. The food = amazing. The waiter became a friend in only one visit. (miss ya John) The ambiance was what I liked. Best guacamole ever. I have had the privilege of speaking with Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza. Have a Tequila question, ask away. She is one of the nicest people I've ever met. So, in conclusion, GO TO  BARRIO! Read the review, try it yourself, make up your own mind.",

I did like the pomegranate seeds but the flavors were bland and the avocado chunks were too big.  in a word, service was exceptionally lazy.  for dinner I had chicken mole enchiladas.  the mole was good but the chicken was way overcooked and very dry.  my guess is it was cooked well before dinner service started.  the globs of cheese underneath the enchiladas were not melted and not very appetizing.  I also tried a taste of the pork taco.  the pork was tender but also lacked flavor.",

There are so many typical \"less than average\" Mexican joints in phoenix, I welcome some different Spanish flair. I had the Cochinita Panil tacos. They were absolutely out of control! My friend and I shared the Queso Fundido which was also terrific. The service was good and the selection of Tequila's is awesome.   So, while it is not another one of the thousands of Mexican joints in the valley, this one actually has something unique.

Big BOLD, spicy flavors :)   I ordered the Guacamole del Barrio to start, it didn't came with pomegranate seeds as seen in other yelp reviews. It came with dried cranberries. It was still fresh and had balanced flavor! I also ordered the Organica Margarita. It was very crisp and refreshing and a decent pour of tequila!   For lunch I decided on the Kuali de Camaron. I saw a gentleman at the table next to me with this order and I was sold on appearance alone. It had bold, spicy and VERY fresh flavors! Large enough to serve as a main dish for me. My guest ordered the Pollo Panlano. It was opposite, creamy and fresh taste, it was a large dish. It came with a side of the chipotle mash potatoes and grilled zuchinni. They did have a Sunday brunch menu until 3 and had a live musician until 2pm.   The restaurant is rather small and very busy, so they were a little slow with the service in the beginning until the servers caught up, but our server Jamie was very pleasant and apologized for the delay.   The artwork (murals) on the exterior walls were beautiful. And the artwork hanging inside was great too! Overall great atmosphere and amazing food! Can't wait to come back and try more!",

I'd return to try out more entrees!",

Initially you're greeted by an entire block of \"street art\", welcoming you to Calle 16.  Our waitress, Gabriella, was very friendly, making us feel at home.  The tableside guacamole was authentic, delicious, and sprinkled with their signature pomegranate seed.  YUM.   My wife ordered the Chiles en Nogada (chicken,fruit, and more in a stuffed poblano.  YUM.   I ordered De Mi Tata (filet mignon topped with crab meat in pomegranate reduction)  a huge portion, cooked to perfection.  YUM.  And for dessert we shared the Churros Rellenos de Cajeta de Cabra (you just got to try this!).  YUM.  Needless to say, we'll be back.  Thanks for a great meal!",

They completely substituted the expectation guest have when visiting a Mexican restaurant. Mixing in the Spanish version of an appetizer. It gave it a different feel. With the live guitarist playing in the back ground. He played Mexican ballads with an elegant feel. We enjoyed lunch in he middle of the afternoon. Quenching my thirst with Agua de Tamarindo. It was not too sweet or too bitter, it was just right. Next we enjoyed a salad that had a perfect balance of spices. We shared the Pozole Verde was perfection and I highly recommend this dish. Lastly we shared an order of Pescado Tacos. A perfect balance of crunchiness.  I recommend Barrio Cafe",

My chicken enchiladas were tasty but not the saucy goodness I was hoping for. There was a thick layer of cheese baked on top and no beans and rice to pull it all together. They also brought me veggie enchiladas at first and half way thru I realized there would never be meat. Lol had to send back. The server fixed it right away.",

Took a while to get drinks. Took even longer to get food(over an hour...) We all ordered tacos. The server did not want to give us the happy hour deal even though we were clearly there during happy hour. Finally he gave it to us.   On to the tacos, they sucked and there was NO consistency. I ordered the same tacos as a co-worker and hers came with sauces while mine were completely dry. We attempted to order a second round of drinks but they never came.   It was just a horrible experience and I'm glad we just went for the happy hour prices. Normally the tacos are $13. That is crazy. There are much better Mexican places close by.",

He than responded with I want you to have the absolute best margarita not a just fine margarita. We didn't wait too long for a table and was sat 30 minutes later.

I ordered the Cochinita Pibil while my boyfriend ordered the Chiles en Nogada. The pork in my Cochinita Pibil was very tender but was missing some flavor. Chiles en Nogada, on the other hand, had such an amazing flavor. I would recommend that to anyone. They both came with tasty mashed potatoes and a corn and zucchini side. Very yummy.

It's definitely not your typical Mexican food.  You won't find beans and rice, they don't serve them.  Instead, side dishes are salads or spicy fries.  You also won't be greeted with chips and salsa but rather French bread and some kind of tapenade.  Not our taste, we won't be returning.",

The house margaritas are not the same and weak, the chips that come with the guacamole are different and the posole soup lacked flavor and large chunks of pork like before. The guacamole is no longer made tableside but comes out premade by the kitchen.  You don't get to chose your ingredients like before. The churro tasted like it was not freshly made but was hard and dense. We hear Silvana is chef at Barrio Cafe Gran so perhaps that is the issue.  Disappointed.",

    "text": "If you've spent any credible amount of time in Arizona (and particularly in the Phoenix area), Mexican cuisine is a not only a staple, but a way of life for gringos and non-gringos alike.  And for most of us, we get what essentially can be described as the \"taco stand\" variety.  Be it tacos, burritos, quesadillas, beans & rice, the usual suspects.  But if you look hard enough you'll find a few restauranteurs brave enough to go beyond the taco stand and explore the various cuisines unique to the different regions of Mexico.  Silvana Esparza is such a chef.  And given the chance, she'll open you up to what you never thought Mexican cuisine could be.  If you're coming here for the first time, do as I did and order the items on the menu that they make special note of.  For example, I got the Lowrider Margarita, their signature drink with 100% pure agave tequila, lime juice, salt, and an extra ingredient I couldn't quite put my finger on.  Opens up your taste buds right away.  For the appetizer, the Guacamole dip is a must.  And this isn't your grocery store guacamole dip nor like any guacamole you've had at a restaurant.  There's seven ingredients that they incorporate table side including (of all things) pomegranates.  Its a sweetness note that immediately sends this guacamole dip into a whole nother stratosphere versus other guacamole dips.  For the main course, I went with Chef Silvana's signature dish, the Chiles en Nogada.  Chicken, four different types of fruit, queso fresco, and a delicate cream sauce stuffed into a roasted poblano pepper.  Its got some kick to it, but not overly spicy at all.  But savory and decadent as can be as that cream sauce is phenomenal.  For dessert, we went with the Churros topped with caramel, vanilla ice cream, candied pecans, and strawberries.  The churros are soft, but crispy with just the right amount of cinnamon and the caramel paired perfectly with the surprisingly intense vanilla bean flavor of the ice cream.  So here's where it can get dicey.  The prices.  If you're used to paying cheap prices for regular Mexican fare, don't worry, you're not alone.  But this upscale food doesn't come cheap.  Total cost for all of my dishes including tip was about $70.  Some people I've gone with are pretty shell shocked sometimes.  Now that said, they have taco dishes as well as other more inexpensive items that won't break the bank.  But if you ask me, you'd be missing out if you go with a safer dish just to save some money.  You'll be missing out on what makes this restaurant an icon in the valley.  I've now been here 3 times and tonight was just as awesome as the last two.  The tacos, the moles, the tortas, as well as all the unique dishes that get their own category are worth the trip and the extra few bucks.  There are legions of awards and accolades Chef Silvana has to her credit over the years.  But my taste buds are what crowns this woman the queen of Mexican food in the valley.",

Once the food arrived we did ask for more salsa among other things that never made it to our table, regardless of being told \"yeah I'll bring it right out!\" The poblano chicken torta however was pretty good. The potatoes felt a little bland, but they were still good. The only reason I would give this place a second thought before coming back was because of the service. And I'm a huge believer of service being everything. You can have the best food, but if your customers don't feel welcomed, and enjoy the service they will hesitate on coming back just like I will",

    "text": "For weeks I have brooded over what I should write about for my 400th review.  How would I celebrate such a milestone??  A splurge at a AAA four diamond restaurant? A Scottsdale shopping trip? A review of someplace my husband and I visited during my recent trips around the state? After much pondering and a couple of meals at mediocre Mexican places here in Phoenix, I remembered that I have never written a review of what is considered by most to be the premiere Mexican restaurant in the valley: Barrio Cafe.  Barrio Cafe is a classic in Phoenix, located in what used to be a single family home in a historic part of town.  Their food is superb.  They serve classic Latin cuisine elevated to a new level.  The menu consists of both regional Mexican dishes not found at your average tourist taco shop in Tempe or Scottsdale nor the mom-and-pop AZ-Mex places located in every strip mall in the Phoenix metro area.  The chef also throws in a few items that can only be described as nuveau Mexican. This is where the Latino foodies (comiditos?) eat.  My personal favorites are the cochita piblil and the red mole.  I also really love the mango shrimp salad - this makes a light, refreshing meal or a great appetizer good for sharing due to the beautiful plating.  The duck in Tamarind sauce is also fantastic and something I have never had anywhere else. In addition to the fabulous entrees I have described they also have tacos and tortas as well as a brunch menu but since it is nowhere near my home or work I have never been here for breakfast or lunch.  I hope maybe someday...",

Barrio Cafe is overpriced and underwhelming.   On the show we saw the chef prepare a chili  relano, but when we went to order it, there's none on the menu. Instead, we went for the chicken enchiladas and fish tacos. We started with the \"award winning\" horchata.   We must have got some from the bottom of the barrel because it was super grainy and gross. I didn't even drink mine at $5.50. The tacos and enchiladas were both fine, but nothing special.  With the amount of hype surrounding this place we expected more - especially for $20 a person or more.",

    "text": "\"Take care of these guys,\" said the manager to the server as he showed us to our table. \"Extra VIP. They used to be regulars. That means someone scared them away.\"  We did used to be regulars. We spent New Years' Eve - the only day for which they take reservations - at Barrio Cafe several years running, until last year when we decided to stay home. Nobody scared us away; we added a few new places to our list, and my husband's job leaves much less time for dining out than we used to have. We hadn't realized how much time had passed since our last visit.   The place still feels the same, with live music on Sundays and local artists' work on the walls. Since it had been so long, it took us some time to take in the menu changes. Is Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza's signature dish, Chiles en Nogada, really available year-round now?   We started with Barrio Cafe's amazing guacamole. During dinner service, the ingredients are brought out and the guacamole is made fresh at your table. Since this was brunch, it was made fresh in the kitchen. I am not complaining. I have tried to recreate this recipe at home and have so far been unsuccessful. Avocados, lime, cilantro, onion, tomato, and pomegranate seeds, right? Something else, obviously, but I just can't get it right, so I'll have to keep going back to Barrio to eat it there.  I didn't get around to asking about the Chiles en Nogada, because I was craving seafood, and the enchiladas mariscos satisfied that craving admirably. I couldn't tell you what my husband ordered, only that the bite I stole was delicious.   \"Did you leave room for dessert?\" The answer was no, but we were brunching at Barrio Cafe, so we ordered Pastel de Chocolate, chocolate cake filled with imported chocolate, almond and cinnamon sauce, and a pot of their smack-your-momma good dark coffee. I couldn't eat the cake, so I stuck to a few heavenly spoonsful of the ice cream with which it was served. The menu says it's vanilla bean, but I tasted hints of cinnamon even without the sauce.  It was, as always, a fantastic meal. If they'll have us, we intend to reclaim our sports as regulars - starting with this New Year's Eve.",

    "text": "Home of the $200 Torta!  O.k., not really.  But I got your attention, didn't I?  While in Phoenix for the holidays I wanted to take my in-laws out to a traditional Mexican meal.  Such is Life has apparently closed, and it was always my staple when I wanted to take friends and relatives to an \"accessible\" meal that wasn't Macayo's, Garcia's or Carlos O'Briens (for the record, none of these place is Mexican...Tex-Mex, yes, and I love them all for that, but it's not the same and you know it).  So while searching for an authentic experience that didn't entail a day trip to visit La Roca in Nogales, I came across this little gem in Central Phoenix  What grabbed me on the menu was the entire section of tortas.  Now THIS is my kind of place!  To open we had guacamole (of course), and it was really flat.  There was no serrano, and I'm not sure if there was any jalepeno.  If I'd stopped here, they would get 1 star.  But they stayed in the game by bringing us two orders of Lobster Quesadillas.  This dish is creative, decadent and decidedly Mexican.  Bravo!  Since the in-laws had never experienced the majesty that is the torta, I thought we'd order four and split them so everyone could gain as much as exposure as possible.  We did the following:  Cochinita Pibil:  According to Robert Rodriguez, this is Johnny Depp's favorite ;).  Barrio Cafe's take on this venerable Central Mexican staple is solid, and I would definitely order it again.  Pollo y Jaiba: Wow!  A grilled chicken breast topped with lump crab meat, avocado, Oaxaca cheese and Hollandaise!  Absolutely classic, and exactly what I was hoping to share when I chose this restaurant.  del Barrio:  Essentialy a roasted Chile Relleno.  My least favorite, and yet it was just far enough outside the box so as to present a new experience while still maintining a sense of familiarity.  de Filetito: The belle of the ball.  This one is a sliced filet mignon, topped with chorizo, blue cheese & chipotle sauce.  Good God, this was amazing.  My father-in-law ate most of my quarter, so I only got 2 bites.  But these two bites, the last of my meal, were the best!  The tequila and beer selections were accommodating without being daunting (no one really needs a choice of 200 different tequilas, do they?).  The shortcomings are in the way of things totally unrelated to the food.  The service was dismissive and the ambiance was like the guacamole (flat, remember).  I'd really like to give them 4 stars, and as I'm looking forward to returning soon, they may just earn that 4th star in a follow-up.",

We arrived about 10 minutes before our table-mates but were seated immediately. Our waiter was friendly and so helpful regarding our choices. We started out with the Barrio Bomba Margarita (me) and the Cadillac Margarita (him.) Very nicely iced and mine was rimmed with both sugar and salt - great combination. The bread here that comes with the olive tapenade is absolutely delicious - a wonderful start to our meal. Dinner for hubby was a small bowl of the posole before the Torta del Barrio, a roasted poblano pepper sandwich stuffed with oaxacan cheese. that posole is probably the best we've ever had. I had the Torta de Cochinita Pibil, a rich roasted pork sandwich topped with sweet purple onions. We both had the crunchy french fries on the recommendation of our waiter with the cocktail ketchup dip. Yum. We tried the kahlua chocolate caramel cake for dessert and it was fantastic. Just the right amount of sweet after a filling meal. The food here is so flavorful - not too spicy at all, just the right amount. It wasn't too crowded on a Sunday evening (thankfully) so we didn't have to wait long. They do not take reservations here either - first come, first served by a gracious staff.

We ordered the chocolate cake and the churros. Hands down, these churros were amazing!  The decadent carmel sauce was rich and a perfect accompaniment for the churros.

I will continue to support this place because I really appreciate what the owners are doing for the community. The art inside and around the building is super dope and changes often so it's nice to always see something fresh, alive and beautiful in the hood. I luv the bread and olive tapenade that is served before your meal. So tasty! There is a plethora selection of tequila & mezcal. In terms of food I got the Crema de Elota Sopa. It's definitely yummy and made from scratch but it's a tad sweet from the corn and only had one shrimp in it but maybe it's an essence of shrimp. Whatever I luv soup. My friend had the Chili Colorado pork chop which was a big ass pork chop w/some serious sauce w/chipotle mash potatoes and super greasy zucchinis. I've also had the Chilis en Nogada a mixture of yummy chilis, cream sauce and nuts which is a good suggestion because there is a lot of history behind this dish and it's a tasty eat. Either way like I said it's a must eat experience in AZ, don't listen to my review I jus want to be honest.",

    "text": "So I have been using yelp for a while now so I figured it was finally time to contribute and help others out. This will be my very first review.   I found this website on a foodie's webpage and I yelped it. The reviews were 98% 5 star so I said it was a must visit.   I am visiting my mom and she had never been there either.   Ok so we pull up to the restaurant and had no clue where we were supposed to park so we pulled a U and came back and parked in the slanted parking at the front. My mom said uh are you sure about this place it looks kinda dumpy. I had read on the other website not to let the outside fool me so I said yep and we went in. The look on the inside is completely different than the feel from the outside. Outside you kinda feel like you need to be looking over your shoulder.   We arrived at around 730-8pm last night (Saturday) and were seated right away.   Ordered the guac. Not really sure what the big deal is. And not really sure why it is over 10 bucks. It didn't have that much flavor. To be honest, I was expecting the best guacamole I have ever had for such a price and because of the reviews on here.   The bread and salsa for the table is kinda weird. The bread was excellent, but I don't like olives so I didn't like the salsa.   My mom had a sangria. She didn't like it so she gave it to me. It was kind of bitter, but I put up with it. It didn't have any slices of fruit in it except a little bitty piece of lime. Pretty disappointing for an $11 drink.   I had the pork plate and my mom had the duck. The plates were beautiful. The pork was tender tender tender. It is a flavor I am not used to so it took me a while to adjust. Overall it was good.   The duck had a great taste. She ordered it medium rare, most of it was cooked to order.   We were too stuffed for dessert.   Our server was very nice.   The pros - good experience, lots of menu choices, good food, smells wonderful  The cons - poor parking, you will be a little crowded, $10 guacamole and $11 glass of sangria?? come on are you for real?  Other than that I would definitely go back because I saw some people eating things I wanted to try haha. And now I know not to get the guacamole or sangria.",

Droves of high schoolers leaving school just as I'm trying to find Barrio Cafe.   Seriously. Like thousands of them. And I couldn't find the damn restaurant. What was I gonna do? Roll down the window (well, not roll down, seriously, who rolls down windows anymore?) and holler out in my best lispy voice, \"Hey, squeeze me fellas, I'm going to a wine tasting at the Barrio Cafe. Y'all know where that is?\" Since all teenagers carry guns, yes, that scared me.   Finally. I found it. And entered.   Cute. Cozy. Middle of the day, so empty. Great, vibrant art. And a very attentive and friendly staff. Often times at this time of day, restaurants really drop the ball. No ball dropping here. I had La Paloma margarita which is made with a grapefruit soda. Think Squirt and Patron! And after a couple of these babies I was in el bano squirting out that Patron. Dee lish however.   I ordered the Enchiladas Del Mar. Enchiladas of the Sea for my non Spanish speaking peeps. You know what? It was good. Not great. And the presentation was somewhat messy. I couldn't find the crab or the scallops (which were the size of the ends of q-tips by the way). They were lost in the sauce and the cheese. But I devoured it as the blue corn tortillas sang to me. My friend had a chickent torta. Big and rustic. Like Janet Reno. She loved it!   I will most definitely be back. Hopefully I will not have to navigate through the plethora of pubescent people and hopefullyl I will pick that Barrio menu item that will blow my calcentinas off.   Oh. That's blow my socks off. BTW. Adios for now mi yelpitas!",

    "text": "We've visited Barrio Cafe twice now. Both times, I've found the food to be okay, but not quite what I'd expect given the price you pay.  The place itself has a very hip ambiance, which I'm sure skews the opinion of many local food snobs. What's kind of bizarre is that they are obviously going for a \"dive\" type feel, despite their prices not really reflecting this. There's plenty of art on the wall for sale, presumably done by Phoenix artists.  Getting a basket of bread instead of the usual chips and salsa is a refreshing approach. I really like the horchatas that are served in Mexican coke bottles. It's a unique flair, if nothing else. Don't expect it to \"wow\" you on the same level as nearby La Santisima's signature horchata, however.  I wanted to try a variety of their tacos, but since they refuse to accommodate any mix and match requests, I was stuck with three carne asadas. They were good, but not really any better (or worse) than what you can get at many other establishments for less. The \"spicy\" fries are actually standard fries with spicy ketchup. Whatever.  My girlfriend's enchiladas suiza felt like they were desperately in need of something to liven them up aside from what was on them. I thought they were pretty boring, despite a pretty elaborate menu description.  We've sampled two desserts on two separate visits. The churros with a scoop of ice cream are good, but the price borders on arrogance. The last time I checked, churros are not costly. But tell us white people that it's \"local\" and suddenly we'll pay an arm and a leg for it, right? However, the Pastel de Chocolate, gives you a bit more bang for your buck and is quite good.  If I come back, I'd probably stop messing around with \"safe\" foods and just get the Chiles en Nogada, since it seems to be the most popular item on the menu. I also intend to sell some of my finger paintings on Barrio's walls if they'll let me. I already picked the space!  In my opinion, it's worth trying, but I don't feel it's a place that's fit for everyone.",

I had the Chile de Nogada and it was wonderful; I'm not normally into sweet and savory dishes but this one was so unexpectedly good. You ever have one of those food moments where you eyes roll back into your head (a.k.a. Foodgasm)? Well I did when I bit into this meal. Hint of sweet followed by heat and I was all in. The pairing of semi sweet dried fruits, nuts, chicken, and stuffed into poblano pepper was amazing and definitely would have it again. My dad ordered the carne asada tacos and freaked out when they did not offer rice and beans as side options, lol. They just don't serve rice and beans here, which I did not know, and we were surprised. My dad is old school and wasn't too happy about that but he loved his tacos, so he was able to recover.    Oh, almost forgot about the Esquite appetizer! Grilled corn cut off the cob and seasoned like Mexican street corn and it was amazing! Even my old school dad liked that!   I have eaten at the airport location several times, however, this original location is way better and I will come back again.",

This place seems to be very popular though as it was completely full with a line of people waiting at 6pm on a Thursday night.  Our server, Claudia, was really great and hooked it up with the chips for us. We are used to the typical free chips and salsa when going to a Mexican restaurant but this place gives bread and salsa.   I'm from Dallas, TX and here we have street tacos and street elotes in a cup for a little over $1 each. We started off with the Esquites which is pretty much like the street elotes we have at home but were pretty shocked a small bowl of it could cost $9. It was good, though. Just not $9 good. I guess I'm used to it being so cheap at home.  We tried the infamous chiles en nogada and were underwhelmed. There was a LOT going on in that dish and maybe it was too complex for our simpleton taste buds? I also could not believe it was a $24 dish...a tad overpriced in my opinion. Not sure what was in there that could make it $24.   I also had to try the acclaimed Cochinita Pibil and got it in taco form. Again, I was underwhelmed...I was excited for it since it is slow roasted over night. The pork was pretty mediocre and the texture wasn't as tender as I thought it would be.",

    "text": "My 100th review! I waited for something truly epic to come along. Here it is. The Barrio Cafe! I drove up to see my bio dad and his wife. They decided to meet at the cafe because they said that they have the best food ever. I was skeptical because I practically live in Mexico, so who has the best food? Tucson has the best food! Just kidding.   I get there and they're packed at 2pm. That's saying something. We had some somewhat slow service, but the guy was super nice so I'm not docking anything.   We get the guacamole first. It has  pomegranate in it or something like that. What?!?! No. This was the best dang guac ever. I mean ever. I ordered the carne asada tacos. It was served with fries and two very unique sauces that I didn't think to ask about. My step mom had this cheese stuff and this corn stuff. I had a bite of the corn and it was incredible. The tacos were awesome.   We had an excellent visit. This was a perfect choice in dining for the occasion. We did end up putting our lady Guadalupe on the floor because we needed more room for food. I'm definitely not religious, but I hit a huge traffic jam on the way home. Next time Lady Guadalupe can stay on the table I guess. I give this place a million stars. One million.   I'm coming to Phoenix for training next month. I'm ready to gain some weight! I hope you're ready for me Barrio folks!",

We tried the cochinita pibil & camaron tacos. All were very good. I would order both again & again. We had 3 cocktails & they were really good but I gotta say on the small side. I know traditionally speaking you get what you pay for & this was a depth of flavor & profile above & beyond traditional Mexican fare. Having said that you get what you pay for. 2 taco entrees (no sides etc) & 3 cocktails came to $63 at lunch time. So if you go make sure you're prepared with some greenbacks in your pockets because this ain't your nana's house.",

I've never had pork so tender and juicy. I got the fries with it and the spicy ketchup that came with it was perfect!! Hands down the best torta I've had in my life (sorry mom. Barrio cafe wins). My brother had the carne asada tacos and they were just as good!! My aunt and mom had the posole verde. You guys..... me personally, I don't like posole, but once I've tasted this one, I had a flavor explosion in my mouth!! Very well seasoned, the pork chunks were just as tender like the torta! And to end tonight's dinner, the restaurant gave us a complementary \"Flan de mi mami,\" UUGGGHHH! It was so creamy, smooth, and just amazing! With fresh strawberries and candies nuts. So perfect!! Thank you Gabriella for an amazing dinner and being the best waitress! We'll be back for sure!! If you guys want this experience, go to Barrio Cafe!! We highly recommend it!",

    "text": "lord, do i hate being made to feel like a princess. never one to send food back, never one to whine and complain. i've been a server for years, so get it. bbuuutttt....   went here last night, totally ready to have a good time for my birthday. called ahead to see if we could make reservations but they answered and said \"no, we don't, but we don't have a line before 7pm, so you should be good.\" (if I would have known it would be such a nightmare, I would have sent a friend earlier to get us in line..) Arrived at 6:30pm and the door dude says 45 minute wait. Then, a table became available, but no, cause one of our 5-top table was still in her car (her bus never arrived). She's there within 10 minutes, but it was another 30-ish before they would/could seat us. I have a voice problem that makes yelling in loud restaurants difficult. Unfortunately, we got seated directly next to the amplified guitar player (in a busy, low-ceiling restaurant, who thought that was a good idea at all?). Needed to use the minuscule bathroom at a certain point and opened the door on some poor unsuspecting woman to the entire dining room 'cause the lock was non-functional. Peed with one hand on the door the entire time. Walking back to our table and someone had opened the outside door next to guitar player, to the winter air... It's January 11th at 7:30pm. Even in Arizona, that's not dining temperature, sorry. So we all put jackets on. Then the food arrives and my vegetarian friend's plate is full of chicken (not listed on menu), so my meat-eating friend graciously traded her for a vegetarian meal. Also completely missed the event I was trying to get to afterwards. All in all, my friends made the best of it, but def will not be coming back here. I was so prepared to have a good time and that was just a horrible meal. The food was alright I guess, but pretty difficult to enjoy when the surroundings were made so unnecessarily unpleasant. On the upside, I got to have a really deep reflective moment, feeling my voice problem as a True disability and feeling so in touch / in tune with all of those with disabilities and the struggles to exist within and participate in modern society. Awesome reflection for aging and birthdays.",

Honestly, it was a bit of a disappointment at first site...but, Phoenix might be one of those places that grows on you after a while. And, I think it's because of these unassuming gems like Barrio Cafe. I was so impressed by the professionalism, kindness, and knowledge of the staff. They know their food!   When it comes to food, let's just get to the best - Cochinita Pibil A.K.A. pork taco greatness! This juicy pork is slow roasted overnight and marinated in achiote and sour orange and you know what, even though it says that on the menu they really don't have to describe it. You can taste every spice in such a clear way. I can tell they take great care of every ingredient, and if anyone can get me to actually enjoy pickled onions they must be a genius. Yes, it's True...the chef at Barrio Cafe is a genius!  Other recommended items include:  Horchata (not your average Horchata either, this one's special) The Camaron - Shrimp Taco, was really good too  Listen, if you're in AZ this weekend because of the Superbowl or another sporting event, you'd really be doing yourself a disservice if you don't come by Barrio Cafe and give their food a try. You'll be really satisified with the truly authentic Mexican food",

The sides on the meals were actually my favorite part and I'm confident I can eat a 5-gallon bucket full of those mashed potatoes they serve.  My god those are good.  One of our meals was $25 and we thought, \"this is great at $15, good at $20, and completely mediocre at $25).\"  This is a great place to bring people from out of town if you're looking for a nice Mexican meal but there's a lot of good Mexican in the Valley at much more reasonable prices for the day-to-day dining.",

We arrived around 430 and there was no wait at all! It was my birthday and they gave us a complementary flan which was excellent! Very dense and Rich. We ordered the guacamole and it was so fresh and delicious. The chips were also fresh. I like that they serve a complementary olive tapenade with bread instead of your typical chips and salsa.  My husband had Suizas enchiladas with chorizo, and I had the chiles en Nogada stuffed pepper.  Both were very good! The chiles en Nogada was very flavorful and had both sweet and savory flavors.  and came with chipotle Mashed potatoes that had a nice kick to them and grilled vegetables.  Our server was great!",

The fish tacos' filling was good but the tortillas didn't look authentic. The ugly: the queso fundido. That is totally not a mexican queso fundido.

I had shrimp tacos, which were plump, juice and fresh. The complimentary guacamole made fresh at the table with avocado, cilantro, tomato, pomegranate, salt and pepper put me on another planet.  My cousin always orders the pulled pork torta, which is amazing and gigantic.  And my lady had halibut topped with lobster, shrimp, crab and scallops -- a seafood-lover's dream.  The only low point on the menu is the sangria, which she returned to the server in favor of a glass of quality red wine.   I refuse to visit Phoenix without making a stop at Barrio.",

One tip... They get \"heat\" and will adjust or accommodate (though some dishes can't be dialed back; they know which ones and can advise).    When the server says it's hot, she's probably not calibrating to some bland Midwestern palate (ie, garlic mashed potatoes are spicy)  but to the desert rat tongue (mas jalapenos por favor).  Even better, they can kick it up a few notches if you ask, and are happy to cook in extra peppers or chiles.    They have a terrific selection of tequilas, though these come at a somewhat excessive cost.  It would be nice to match up a few choice  agave spirits with the meal without feeling like I've been rolled.  That almost made it a three, but this place just isn't average, so have your shots elsewhere.",

The guacamole was a good starter -- chunky and made fresh at the table with lots of sweet pomegranate arils, it was unique and tasty. Nice chips too. Unfortunately my margarita was sub par -- clearly they didn't get the ingredients balanced properly. Both of our entrees were very good overall; I had the chicken enchiladas with tomatillo sauce and spicy mashed potato side, and my girlfriend had the Chiles en Nogada. However, while I loved the flavor of my enchiladas, some of the tortillas were noticeably dry. Finally, we had the churros with caramel sauce for desert, which was just OK due to the churros being overdone.  Overall, a 3.5, but I'm rounding down due to high expectations. I'd certainly give them another try, but they need to eliminate the rough edges next time.",

Add on an order of guacamole and a few drinks, the two of us walked out of there full, buzzed, and happy at just over $40.

The tortillas were extremely dry. Would avoid that dish if you were planning on picking it.  The service here, although nice and friendly, was extremely slow. When I got there, there was no line, yet somehow the tables inside were still not cleaned so I had to wait. After waiting several mins, one of the guys just gave up and walked me to a large table (way bigger than what was necessary, but all the small tables still had dirty plates on them). For a first impression, we're already off to a bad start. Coincidentally, my last impression was also one of slow service. I couldn't get my servers attention for the life of me. She was the only one working the entire back room it seemed like. All I wanted was to get my check to leave. After sitting there for a good 10 mins just trying to flag her down, she finally came to my table to see how I was doing. After telling her I wanted the check, another 10 mins pass by (she forgot, apparently) yet still no check. Again, I had to try and flag her down and ask for the check. I finally get the check after what seemed like 30 mins of just trying to pay and leave.",

Prices are on the more expensive side for what you get (10 dollars and up), and some items such as aguas frescas will run you a whopping $5 for a glass, but all in all it was a nice meal.

The restaurant was a bit difficult to find, and the hostess was very friendly about vectoring me in by telephone. The enthusiastic and friendly server got drinks and house made chips on the table extremely quickly. Next up was the table-side guacamole; he custom prepared it from a cart containing pre-chopped and fresh avocado, tomato, onion, chiles, limes and cilantro. My teenage daughter declared it 'the best guac ever'!  I concur -- fab and custom. I agree with Mark C.'s review, and that the addition of the pomegranate seeds sends this dish to a new level!  I enjoyed one of the evening's specials: Halibut Vercruz style. Hailing from Seattle, I am extremely picky about my fish, and I usually never order it outside of my own burgh. However, since we have a deficiency of Mexican cuisine in Seattle, I ventured forth and was not disappointed. The halibut was ocean fresh and perfectly cooked -- just flaky to the fork. The Veracruz sauce it was bathed in blew me away: it was filled with piquant olives, capers and tomatoes and was redolent of garlicand chile. Fantastico. All of this fresh, flaky, flavorful deliciousness was generously portioned and placed atop Yukon Gold mashed potatoes, which were a perfect creamy canvas for the bold sauce. There was also some flavorful sauteed zucchini and onion.  My teenage companions rated the fish tacos as excellent and very fresh.  I did not get to taste them.  A fellow diner at another table commented that his filet mignon was excellent.  Barrio Cafe is a great dining experience. The chef creates dishes which are complex, interesting and layered.  The service was prompt, friendly and extremely efficient.   When we exited the restaurant after our meal, the restaurant was entirely full, with people waiting as well. Lucky them -- I can't wait to return to Phoenix and dine at Barrio Cafe.",

I like trying a restaurant several times before I review it.  2 stars for flavor and enjoyable live music, however the prices are a bit high, service can be inattentive and slow.   It's been about a year since my previous visit and the menu appears to have updated. Along with most if the previous items there are now some less pricey options, however taste no longer justifiable.  Don't know what it is but it feels and tastes different.

This place falls way short on the flavor-roma scale when it comes to tasty Mexican food.   We have a group of five, so we tried several things on their menu.  The first thing we noticed were the portions.  Muy pequena!  Ok, so this is different than what many of the pics on Yelp look like but maybe it's not the size that matters in this place but rather the quality of food.  Pues no, la calidad es el mejor promedio (nope the quality is average at best).  Many of the pollo and rice items were very dry.  We also had an issue with our server.  He was no where to be seen for several minutes so we had to sick the hound dogs after him to get some refills.   Anyways, this place seems to fill up with plenty of locals.  So good luck!",

The cochinita was really well cooked and still moist, though not served (and maybe not prepared) in banana leaf. Served as make-your-own-tacos. Friend ordered carne asada tacos, which seemed fine.   Drink: Small full bar with a medium-sized beer menu.   Service: Table service was very attentive. Problem was with the door staff, which told us the wait was \"25 minutes or less\" and turned out to be a full hour. People weren't sat in the order they arrived. Despite having a good number of staff around, they just weren't turning tables over; empty tables would sit unbussed for 15 minutes. We waited on their little patio, which was fine enough, except the staff kept coming out onto the patio, staring vacantly at the street, and then engaging each other in really animated conversations about nothing. The whole thing was a bit weird.   Ambiance: Crowded and a little bit noisy, but not unenjoyable.   Bottom line: They've reached some level of fame on the back of their good food. Staff just needs to keep it real. Recommend going, but not waiting if there's a long line.",

No, you are not going to be served chips and salsa, but rather bread and an olive tapenade that is to die for.  Yes, they do offer tacos and enchiladas, but the are not what you are used to in all other Mexican restaurants.  This is one of the best restaurants in Phoenix, regardless of the style of cuisine.  I would eat here again and again, and oh, by the way, I am a chef and a very, very picky one at that.  Two downers - no draft beer, just bottles.  The other is that our server was less than attentive for the price of the food.  Not horrible, but just not up to the quality and price of the food.  I had to ask for a refill on my drink, which a good waiter would have done automatically without my having to ask.  That's the reason for not giving this place 5 stars, and the only one.  Pricey, yes, but worth every penny.",

Upon arrival, the parking lot was small but colorful with the graffitis on the walls.  We were seated right away since it was still early and were brought bread with a very excellent salsa (it's got olives in it!).  I ordered the stuffed chicken of course, and the boyfriend had the 12-hour roasted pork.  Despite the good reviews on the tableside avocado, we did not order it as it is really something that can be made at home for 1/10 the price.  For our mains, my pepper stuffed chicken was heavenly with each bite.  The almond slices give everything a nice texture and the pomegranate seeds were a creative compliment.  I literally ate everything except for the stem.  The boyfriend's roast pork taco was very good as well.  The pork had an unusual tangy taste that's not found in your typical pork taco.  The portion was big so we were full just on entree alone.  The only downside of the evening was that our waiter seemed bored and did not really care about serving us.  Despite the service, I would definitely come back for the chicken if I was ever lucky enough to be in town again.",

    "text": "So I was toying with 3 or 4 stars.  And as you can see,  I settled with four stars because I know I will be back.  So we have eyed this place for YEARS.  It has been booked marked for me since I have started yelp.  And one Sunday evening we finally decided to give it a try.  It starts off with a 45 minute wait, which I expected, but luckily we only had to wait 10 minutes.  I am glad they prepared to expect the worse, so as I braced myself for a long wait it felt like a gift when in 10 minutes we were seated and perusing the menu.  We had to try the guacamole.  You get to chose what goes in it, and the server recommended everything, which means everything you expect in a guac with something you don't expect: pomegranate seeds.  It was expensive, but fresh and very good.  Now the reason why I toyed with 3 stars.  My entree.  I had the carne tacos and hubby had the Cochinita Pibil.  I honestly though they were just okay.  Hubby RAVED about his slow roasted pork.  I found it tender, but not tasty.  My carne tacos were good enough, but for the price and all the hype I guess I had expected to be wowed more.  Service was good.  So back to toying with the stars again. Expensive Mexican food, but it was kinda worth it....  See I am trying to figure that one out.  So I need to come back and try another dish. I do think this place is more than just the 3 star definition of A-OK.  For me, it is more like 3 1/2 stars. I decided to round up to four stars, because I will be back. Also my hubby enjoyed it so much, and that makes me happy.  But this was the most reluctant four stars I have yet to hand out.",

When we were seated, I already knew we were going to order the tableside guacamole (one of the items I found to be a bit over priced)  $12 for a pretty small bowl of guacamole.  Yes, it was fantabulous, so in the end I didn't mind paying...but it was a pretty small bowl to be shared between 3 people.  It was made very quickly (with little/no interaction from our server...when I noticed the other server in the area was laughing and explaining the process to his tables....however, our server was not the most personable of fellows...) and with very fresh ingredients, cilantro, jalapeno, pomegranate seeds...opted for no onions, and topped with fresh lime juice and seasonings.  It was delicious.  I also have to add that the tostadas that they use are fantastic.  Crispy, thick, not greasy or salty at all!  We ordered a couple of drinks, I chose my go-to drink: Michelada with Tecate.  I went picosito and it was delicious.  The right amount of hot sauce, lime juice and beer!  A friend of mine ordered the spicy margarita (which our server forgot and had to be reminded) and she loved it!    As for our meals, 2 of us chose the Mariscos enchiladas.  A white cream sauce with oaxaca cheese, bay scallops, shrimp...HUGE shrimp cooked to perfections, and crab meat.  A few hunks of calabasitas and it was ...TO...DIE...FOR!!!  The sauce really complimented the various seafood and not one of the ingredients overpowered any other.    The birthday girl opted for the carne asada tacos with spicy fries....spicy? Not so much...but very tasty!    We were stuffed.  But...it was my friend's birthday so we had to have some dessert!  We looked over the menu and before we could finish deciding, they brought over the best flan I have ever had in my life!  The consistency was ideal and it was covered with this caramel sauce and candied pecans.  Needless to say, we made room for the flan!    We were beyond satisfied with our meal, however...the service we received left a lot to be desired.  I found myself envious of the other tables who were greeted with smiles and had a server that waited for his customers to finish their sentences.  Ours made us feel as if we were a burden and he had better things to do.  He never acknowledged our orders and just walked away when we finished...almost before we finished and was always looking around instead of making eye contact.    I will be back and hopefully the service I receive will warrant me doing the well-deserved 5-star marking for this place!  Thank you Chef Silvana!  You are a gem in the Valley of the Sun!",

    "text": "I was extremely disappointed with my meal. I'd been here twice before and was impressed each time. This time, not so much. They have excellent guacamole (although anyone can mix some pomegranate in, right?), but the rest was insulting.  My entree (chile en nogada) came out on a very hot plate, yet the chile itself, while charred, was not warm at all. The chicken in the filling was warm, but not anything else. The zucchini side was mushy, and the potatoes that came with it were clearly nuked on the same plate as the zucchini.  I told the server my concerns, and a new plate of everything was quickly brought over in no more than two minutes. Again, parts of the entree and the side were not thoroughly heated, yet overly heated in other parts. The manager asked how things were, and I let him know I thought even this was microwaved. While he might have brushed the accusation aside, he did not emphatically deny it.  My dining partner's meal, chicken mole, was equally disappointing. Three (three?!?) chicken breasts that were clearly cooked hours before and reheated, with some mole tossed on at the last minute. The tips were rubbery and the thicker portions of the breasts were not warm to the touch.  When our waiter came back to ask how the second attempt was, I complained again that it seemed microwaved and he simply said \"Sir, I'm not sure why you're so mad, but have a good night. Goodbye.\"  We left without further discussion.",

    "text": "Barrio Cafe serves up nontraditional Mexican.  Okay. So some have complained this place does not offer traditional Mexican food. If you are looking for Taco Bell or Del Taco style fixings consider going elsewhere. But if you're looking for a cool and new twist on Mexican flavors this could be your spot.  The service here was quick and attentive. The busboy was fast to bring a basket of bread and an amazing olive spread (pictured.)  The flavors of the spread were pungent enough to be memorable yet not overpowering.  A side salad (pictured) was included with my lunch. It had a flavorful mixture of Roquefort cheese, dried cranberries, spinach and salsa. It would have been perfection had it not been for the too-spicy balsamic vinaigrette dressing which nearly disguised all the other flavors.  The Torta de Filetito (pictured) was my entree. The first decision I had to make was how to tackle it. It was piled too high to eat as a sandwich, yet trying to slice through the crusty bread (even with a steak knife) proved to be nearly impossible.  The fillet mignon was flavorful, though could have been a bit more tender. It was also to have included chorizo though I found no sign anywhere...or could it have simply had no flavor and been mistaken for the chipotle wine sauce???  The portion size was more than ample though many pictures of the same entree on <a href=\"http://yelp.com\">yelp.com</a> display this entree with french fries. I did not see french fries on the menu nor were they presented on the plate. Could this have been what the restaurant considers a \"lunch portion\" or was it nearly forgotten?  A few tweaks and this place could be a five-star restaurant, in my opinion. I realize that space is at a premium though I personally do not care for the unisex restrooms. (One of the two was out of order, but this is the norm here anyway.). I may try this place a second time someday and if I do I think I'd like to try their margaritas.",

    "text": "Holy cow this was a good, yet expensive late lunch. Most entrees are over 20 bucks and there are no lunch specials in site. Luckily, my company picked up the tab, but the food is worth the price if you want to pay that much. My choice was the chicken enchiladas suiza, which needed a touch more sauce, but the corn tortillas were freshly made and loaded up with grilled white meat chicken and cheese. We also tried the guacamole which was not made tabelside as the menu states. This version was chunky with pomegrante seeds thrown on top. Hot chips arrived and the salsa was also top notch. Finally finished things off with churros bathed in caramel, nuts and ice cream. It's not in the greatest part of town, but that is where to find best Mexican food.",

The ambience was great when you first walk in with live music and some awesome art on display that is also for sale. The horchata is as delicious as you would expect although the price is rather high considering i know what goes into the drink but I knew what I was getting into. For a starter we chose esquites which was delicious but definitely on the spicier side, I think a little less spice would have gone a long way for flavor. Our main courses were the Chile's en Nogada and the Steak with chipotle sauce. Both dishes were delicious although the steak was supposed to have crab but we couldn't find it. The horchata and esquites were slightly overpriced but the main dishes I think were fair and delicious. We will definitely come back and try new items",

Also got Chiles en nogada which was actually quite unique.  Spicy pepper stuffed with chicken and sprinkled with pomegranate - it's the one dish I'd recommend.  Both dishes had bland and forgettable sides.  Churros for dessert were okay but not great, and the horchata and frescos were good but crazy stupid over priced given they are just sugar water shaken up in a coke bottle.",

Our guest from out of town agreed. He ordered a house margarita first, then a top shelf & both were awful! I'm not sure if it was the bartender or the mix but something was wrong. So 3 of 3 were BAD! I heard another table also commenting on how bad they were.  The food was stellar as always. But geez, please bring back the yummy Ritas!!",

    "text": "Maybe I had too high of expectations. Maybe I ordered the wrong items. But the food was just alright, and the price didn't help, considering I could have gotten a highly-satisfying $5 burrito next door but instead paid $40 here.   We ordered the guacamole and the Suizas and Verde enchiladas. The addition of pomegranate seeds to the guacamole was an interesting touch. I thought it would add too much sweetness, but instead it balanced out the tartness of the lime juice. Which, the guacamole just tasted like lime juice and avocados and pomegranate seeds to balance out the lime juice. Nothing else special.   The Suizas enchiladas, like some other reviewers pointed out, just tasted like cream (milk) and cheese. The chicken breast was somewhat dry and bland. Nothing exciting here either.   The Verde enchiladas had a decent verde sauce. Also nothing exciting.   Service mishaps: We sat at the bar and waited over an hour for a table (which they informed us ahead of time). However, even though they had checked we were there midway, they still managed to skip us so we waited at least an extra 30 minutes. They said they called us, but mind you, we were seated right next to the hostess stand so there was no way we missed it.  Also, I ordered the esquites appetizer and chorizo for my enchiladas but they never came... and the server didn't even check up on us once.   Food: 2.5 stars, rounded down to 2 due to service.   Better luck next time?",

    "text": "Stay away!  Tourists might be lured to this spot from the exposure on Guy Fieri's show Diner's, Drive-In's, and Dives, but the quality of service is nothing like what we expected.   Before coming in, we checked an online menu on their website. Oddly, no prices were anywhere on the online version. When we sat down and opened the real menu, we learned why. 3 tacos: $15. Torta: $16. Small bowl of guacamole: $18. We thought it might be worth it and decided to stay.  Within minutes of sitting down, and with some time left in happy hour, we ordered a few drinks. We were told they would be at happy hour prices (half price), but the bill came and they were at full price.   The food arrived about 20 minutes after ordering. We had 3 orders of carne asada tacos and 2 tortas. Some of us opted for salads on the side, were very bland, with just lettuce and craisins. Very odd for a Mexican restaurant. The fries that came with the others were also lacking in flavor without any of the spicy ketchup on the side. When the food arrived, it was somewhat flavorful, but we have had far better quality at other locations. This, along with the tiny portions, do not justify the high prices at all.   Next, the server. Our waiter was a loud man who decided to crack jokes at us from the very beginning. He was trying to be funny, but came off as offensive. It also took a long time for him to get back to the table and take our order. He also never checked in during out meal. Several minutes after everyone finished eating, we had to go to the front and ask for the bill. The waiter then decided to awkwardly stand over us as we signed the check and refused to answer any questions about why a 20% tip was added. When asked about the happy hour drink pricing issue, he simply stated \"it was after 5pm when I entered it into the computer\" despite promising that we would receive happy hour prices. Ultimately, he fixed the price, but returned to the table and pointed that out on the bill in a very rude manner.   Finally, a 20% tip was added for a table with 4 children and 2 adults. This is completely unacceptable given the terrible service we had and the rudeness of our server. No wonder the service was terrible: the waiter knew he would get his 20% and decided to slack off for an hour instead of doing his job!",

Extremely tasty and fresh, the tecate beer battered shrimp tacos were excellent. Saw a server preparing fresh guacamole at the next table and would have ordered it had I not been dining alone - huge serving and it looked incredible. So glad someone recommended this local place to me! Atmosphere was cozy and just right.",

Bread and Olive spread is tasty.  Made from Spanish olives.  Roasted corn soup  is the best I have ever had!!!  I order their highly acclaimed pork in banana leaf entree.  OMG, so moist and tasty.  Unfortunately, on the salty side, especially after the Olive spread.  I couldn't finish it because of that.  (I still took it home!)  Pork is partnered with mashed potatoes, fresh cooked veggies and tortillas.  Portions are large and can be shared by two.  I will return and get the corn soup but will try a new entry .",

(oh! and watch out for same large jalapeno chunks in pico on tacos!) 3 to an order for $15  lots of tasty sounding choices of fresh fish of the day, steaks, chicken, tacos, tortas, enchiladas and specials of the house. fish & meats served with choice of sauces.   desserts looked and sounded wonderful, but i ate all my tacos! no room!  fresh aquas frescas and horchatas too - $5.50  one more note... im all for ambience... but i have trouble with eating in the dark. once the sun went down, my table near center of the room was DARK! i prefer enough light to see my plate.  service was good.",

I dont think I've ever had a tab that had $20+ for just lemonade lol.  As far as the service, they took a while to get us out of there. My two toddlers were going nuts.

It's definitely not your normal Mexican spot...they don't have rice or beans and they don't serve chips and salads. Instead they serve bread and some other stuff with it...it was okay....the waiter was okay....he was kinda rude when we asked if the had rice and beans he said \"no we don't serve that, whatever you see on the menu is what you get\". It was obviously our first time here and he didn't care to explain how this place isn't the typical Mexican restaurant. I ordered GREEN enchiladas and when I got my food they were RED. The chicken isn't even shredded in the Tortilla it's literally like a whole chicken breasts. I tried to eat it, but it just wasn't good. So I told the waiter this isn't what I ordered and he looked at his paper and said \"oh yeah you're right\". Umm okay I know I'm right. So I asked him to take it off. My bf ordered chorizo with eggs and potatoes....the meal looked like a joke. First off the server forgot to add the chorizo and it only came out with 2 eggs and a very small side of potatoes for $15?!! He then brought the chorizo on the side in a small little cup that they serve ketchup in.   I don't recommend this place. Our service sucked and the food is mediocre.",

Sometimes I feel like \"fancy\" Mexican is just regular Mexican food but more expensive. The chef here, however, has compiled a playful menu of regional Mexican dishes and way more than an upgraded Tex Mex.   I opted for the Chiles en Nogada, which I was super pleased by. The pepper had just enough kick and was balanced well with the creamy sauce. All the flavors inside worked well together and made every bite taste unique. The side was okay. The mashed potatoes were flavorful (lots of garlic) but the squash was a bit mushy. Didn't ruin the dish but didn't add a ton. The pepper was enough to carry the meal, although I appreciated a thoughtful departure from just beans and rice. Another person got the Yucatan style pork and it was also delicious.   We weren't really hungry but the churros looked so delicious! We got them and I was glad we did. Super tasty. Do wait for a second because the filling was super hot.",

I got the Enchiladas Suizas, which was essentially sugary chicken, cheese, and milk that tasted like a frozen microwave dinner. I love cheese and this was too much cheese. My fiancee got one of the tacos, which were alright, but not $12 good for the portions and flavors. The best part of the meal was the Guacamole, which had pomegranate seeds in it.  As for the service, it was minimal.  It was not busy at all and we waited a long time to be seated, for anyone to come take our order, for waters, and then a long time for the check - though oddly the food came fast.  I did not finish my enchiladas (I admittedly barely ate) and the waiter asked if I wanted it packed up, I said no thank you.  Later the manager came by and asked if I wanted it packed up and I said no thank you to him as well.  He asked me if I liked it and I said it was alright (I didn't want to be rude). He then launched into a story about how you should not lie and gave me literally his whole life story and how hard he has worked to get here. If he was looking for sympathy for a better tip, admittedly it worked, because based on the food and service I would have tipped on the low end.   I left feeling a bit conned, I spent a ton of money on food I didn't enjoy, wasted my time doing a lot of waiting throughout the service, then more time (I was really trying to get to an evening appointment) when the manager lectured me on telling him if I liked his food or not and his tragic backstory. He seemed nice enough, and I sympathize, but the combination of everything left a figurative and literal bad taste in my mouth.",

I'm left with these questions on my mind during and after the meal. What are the other people eating and are we in the wrong place?   The food here does not live up to the lore painted on the colorful walls and menu. The bread and dip brought out while we ordered was stale and the dip was unmemorable. My wife insisted that we order the guacamole. I was not a fan of the flavor combinations of pomegranate and lime. It was Sunday, so we ordered from the brunch menu. I had the enchiladas verde and was extremely disappointed. The enchiladas were okay in certain places but mostly tasted like something I could cook at home myself. I absolutely hated everything else on the plate from the soupy and over sweetened verde sauce, burned potatoes and pico de gallo that was just out of place on the dish.   At least the place was not crowded. I would have had to ask for a refund if I waited 2 hours like I've heard people do. The live music was cool and the place had a nice atmosphere.

    "text": "I was in Tempe for a meeting and my hosts had taken me out for Italian and then Chinese food.  Having lived in Europe for the past six years I wanted Mexican for my last nights meal.  I googled \"Best Mexican food in Phoenix\" and the Barrio Cafe came up as #1.   We piled into the car and went.  The restaurant seems to be in a working-class area with a mix of residences and businesses There is parking out back and the exterior walls are painted with bold, slightly cultural graffiti paintings.  Baron Samedi is there, not sure why, and various skull-themed portraits.  There is a patio where you can have a drink while you wait for your table.  The view onto N 16th St is nothing to look at but if you order one of their signature Margueritas you won't care.  They are delicious.  As I was not driving and the meeting was over, I sampled a couple.  Some have fruit juices like pomegranate or chambord.  This is not traditional Mexican fare.  It's Mexican with some creative license.  I had a roasted corn salad dressed with a goats milk cheese and subtle flavorings.  Delicious.  For dinner I had a slow cooked suckling pig that had been wrapped in banana leaf.  It was quite good although looking at the plates of my colleagues I think I might have switched to one of their plates.  They loved their food.  Happy to have gone and would go again.",

    "text": "I went here off the recommendation of a former teacher of mine. I love finding these local secrets. We went on a Tuesday night, and it was packed. You know a restaurant is good if it is packed on a Tuesday.  We were lucky to get seated right away. We had the whole family there including the baby. I thought they seemed a little put off by the baby, so that didn't make me feel too good. Its ok though because my baby surprises everyone by how much so loves going out to eat. She is a foodie in the making and tries everything.  Anyways, we ordered margaritas to start with. They were very tasty and strong but quite expensive. In fact all the drinks were too expensive. My \"house\" margarita was 10 dollars.   Our service was a little iffy and our waiter kept disappearing and would not check back on us. This is why I didn't give them 4 stars. I felt the service was poor. We had to wait a long time to try and place our orders. We asked for more bread and he seemed irritated by it, and it took a while to get it. I guess I just did not feel the love. it took a long time to get the check at the end. No bueno.   The food was really really good though. I loved the guacamole. I want all my guac to have pomegranate seeds in it now. I also liked my cheese and mushroom enchiladas. They were delicious. I thought it was weird that they didnt have rice and beans and wanted to serve steak fries. That is fine if you want to be different, but the steak fries were soggy and not very good. I would have expected them to be better if they are wanting to be different.  I think this place would have been 4-5 stars, but the service brought it down.",

The environment is white walls, cheap tables, uncomfortable iron chairs, and the bathrooms are dirty. The chicken enchiladas are $20, and a tiny portion. The shrimp tacos, seriously only come with one shrimp per taco. I literally had to slice my shrimp in half just to spread it across the tiny tortilla. Ridiculous. Especially when it's priced at $14. That's $14 for 3 pieces of shrimp and some garnish. No thank you. If the restaurant tried to make the interior look more upscale, I would possibly consider retrying, but for those prices in that atmosphere it's not worth it. The food itself was not stand-out flavor either. Won't be going back ever.",

Loved the atmosphere and the parking in the rear, provided a nice urban feel too often lacking among Phoenix's stucco-covered strip mall restaurants.  Service was good.  I had the pulled pork tacos, the boss had the carne asada tacos.  He felt his were \"good, but not great\".  I thought the pulled pork was excellent.  Unlike most \"street\" taco plates, these were fully stuffed with excellent pork.  The sauces on the side were terrific and unique as well.    I'm a fan and I'll be back.  There are some unique dishes that I still want to try.  The menu certainly isn't your typical Mexican fare.  The only draw-back that I saw would be the prices.  They're certainly proud of their menu, perhaps a little more than is warranted in my view.",

    "text": "We have been wanting to try this place out for a while but there was always a long line during peak times. However last night we went out a little early (5:30PM) and found that there was no line and plenty of tables. Make sure you park in the back and don't stop in front of the restaurant itself or you will block traffic on 16th Street. Plenty of parking in the back. Besides the back and sides of the building are covered in these beautiful murals. Definitely worth a few photos.   We walked in from the back door. The restaurant is really cute and homey. Very clean. There is a really cute little bar up in the front. Our server sat us. He had the most beautiful accent. I could have listened to him describe the specials all night. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and the ingredients and how things were prepared. He was also very warm and friendly and seemed to really enjoy his job.   Instead of chips and salsa he brought out the most delicious bread along with an amazing olive spread. I loved it and I really am not a big fan of olives. It was that good. My friend loves olives and she was in heaven. We both stated to get excited about what was in store for us.    We started off with the signature \"Lowrider\" margarita as it was half off on happy hour. Normally it is $12 but we got them for only $6. At first we were startled at the regular price but after a few sips we found it a bargain as it was very strong and it was half-off due to happy hour. And very tasty. But if your driving you may only want to have one just to be safe. (NB Cafe Barrio is on major bus lines so public transit is always an option,)   I had the chicken enchiladas with brown mole sauce. The enchiladas were amazing. The mole sauce had hints of smoldering chocolate and was so tasty. I fell in love. The sizes were generous as well. The main dish was accompanied by these amazing mashed potatoes which were out of this world. The food was excellent. So good in fact that we didn't save any room for desert.  The only downside to this cafe is the price. It was a little on the pricey side with our bill coming out to a little over $60 for two people. However, for a special treat type place with a date Barrio Cafe can not be beat. The food was very fresh, very tasty and its not your usual Mexican menu. I really enjoyed my food and my time at Barrio Cafe and will happily go again.",

When you go in later on weekends there's music, which can sometimes make conversation little difficult.  The restaurant is small but the service is excellent. There is a man who clears and sets tables so skillfully that it is a show in itself.  Now for the food. The chef won a James Beard award and it shows. On this visit, I had the Veracruz which is a savory fish dish prepared with olives and capers.  I've had this at other restaurants, but never as good as this.  My husband had the pescado del mar, which was heavenly.  The guacamole is pricey, but prepared at your table and well worth it.  Portions are generous, but save room for some crepas de cajeta- glorious caramel with cinnamon pecans and a ball of ice cream...worth every little calorie.  We go out to dinner pretty often, but this is our favorite.",

I try to put service aside because you never know if they were short staffed etc.  The tableside guac portion is extremely small $11.75.  I had the mole enchiladas, which were served cold. The flavor was pretty good but it was a basic chicken enchiliada with mole on top for $20.  Overall, I thought the food was decent and would probably pay for it at 60% of what is charged (especially given the location).  I really don't see what was innovative or standout in any of the 7 dishes our table ordered.  If anything, I think this place benefited from the Guy hype and lack of competition in the marketplace.  This place would not survive in a foodie town.",

Portions are not enormous, but decent.This is not your Americanized Mexican restaurant. Everything is gourmet and fabulous, with attention to detail.

A bit over priced I sat in one day at the bar and ordered an iced horchata at happy hour which comes in a rediculously cool CocaCola glass bottle from the 70s or something. Unfortunately they made mine wrong b I had ask for no Kahlua being one of the rare few who dislikes coffee. But the bartender redid my drink Horchata, ice and only cream liquor. It was EXCELLENT! Usually I grab virgin horchatas around town at the Sinaloan or Mexican smaller restaurants around town. But the recipe is so amazing at Cafe Barrios. LOVE LOVE LOVE!

P A S T E L  de  C H O C O L A T E  a la  O A X A C A  All this items were very basic without any interesting or complex flavor combinations except for the dessert.  The flavor and presentation of the food was unremarkable. I think we might have ordered the wrong stuff but there shouldn't be any wrong stuff at a good restaurant.  Also, they bring you bread instead of chips and salsa.  I don't mind the bread but it should be freshly baked bread at a James Beard nominated restaurant.  This was some store bought bread from Safeway or Fryes.  The guacamole  had cranberries not pomegranates as advertised.  It was fine but the whole guac show at the table is really unnecessary.  Plus, their show is lame.  They just mix the crap in a bowl in front of you.  They don't even have a mortal and pestle made of stone where they mash it up.  If you're going to go through the trouble of doing something like that, I want to see stoneware from an ancient mayan temple.  No theater whatsoever.  Service:  Our waiter looked like a cross between a pirate and a convict.  He had the vocal expressiveness of a mime.  When we asked about the food, he told us exactly what was written on the menu.  He was also irritated that we asked questions since it was clearly written on the menu. Corpses have more passion about what they do.    Decor/Ambiance/Location:  Overall, the decor and ambiance of the place is simple, comfortable, and unpretentious .  The tables are covered with tablecloths and the lighting is dimly light.  You can definitely bring a date with bad skin here. There was a good Mexican band playing live music.  The bathroom has more Crucifixes and Mother Mary iconography than an Italian grandmother's house.  The restaurant is located in a neighborhood that earns the designation \"barrio\".   I was pleasantly surprised that my hubcaps weren't missing when I returned and was happy that nobody stabbed me. I like an adventure but next time I want to put my life on the line I will be going to Beirut not Mexican food.",

We found the Barrio when it was 6 months old and it is still one of my top 3 restaurants in Az. People who blanch at the price are used to the family-style overly cheesy, milder Sonoran style food. Mexico's different regions represent much more complex and varied flavors than that, and the owner has studied and raised Mexican food to an art form. NOTE: someone called this \"Tex-Mex\" and I am fairly certain the owner/chef would be greatly insulted at the term. Tex-Mex is NOT Mexican food! It is a style bastardized for Anglo tastes and is not authentic to any region of Mexico.",

It's constantly packed it seems and I've heard nothing but good things about it. Finally, my boyfriend and I decided to stop by for dinner. I have to say, I am a little disappointed. Maybe my hopes were too high, but our meals weren't as great as I thought they'd be, especially for the price. My boyfriend had the carne asada tacos - they were the blandest tacos I've ever tasted. Filibertos has better tacos. I had the duck salad. That actually was fairly good, but there was a little too much duck fat for my taste. The menu also listed grilled tomatoes in my salad, but there literally was ONE tomato! Very odd.  The thing I enjoyed the most though was the artwork by Lalo. A truly talented artist. I enjoyed checking out his artwork while eating. The decor is really cool too, although a bit crammed inside.  I had Chino Bandidos for lunch that same day and honestly, it was far more enjoyable than Barrio Cafe - and much cheaper! I'd rather go there any day over this place. It was good, but nothing like what I thought it'd be. Won't be going back I don't think.",

It was rainy and a great day for a drive to Phoenix to try something new. We were both pleasantly surprised. We only had a 5 minute wait for a table, but were asked several times if we had been greeted and reassured more than once that they'd have a table right away for us.  We both ordered tacos, one shrimp and one pork. The shrimp tacos were the best, the pork could have used a little more flavor.  All in all a darn good experience, although Barrio is a little on the pricey side.",

We were told it would be an hour and that didn't seem unreasonable and since it was a nice day we sat out on the small patio and enjoyed some drinks and conversation.  Our table was ready and our expectations high.  Service was not fast but our waitress was friendly enough.  We ordered a double order of the famous guac and lets just say it was ok.  If you like super chunky avocado \"dip\" with pomegranate seeds this is for you.  It was interesting but to be honest we were so hungry after 90 minutes we all chowed down.  We ordered entrees and waited another 30-40 mins.  Now we were ready for some of this highly touted award winning chef food.  Let's just say we were all pretty much let down.  Food was not flavorful and didn't even seem all that fresh.  I've had better Mexican in the Midwest.  The menu was interesting and I'm hoping we just caught a bad night but I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.",

We were hesitant to come again after reading some of the concerns expressed by Yelp reviewers.  We had such a good experience several years ago; we didn't want it followed by a bad one.  Thankfully however, we had a WONDERFUL dinner with EXCELLENT service from Claudia, our server.  The wait was not long, the service was very friendly, and the portions on par with prices.  For the people expressing disappointment in pairing guacamole with cranberries or pomegranate:  stay home!  This is all part of the experience and this is how it is done in various parts of Mexico.  They make the guacamole at your table and you can guide them in what you want added to it (more spices, less onions, no fruits, as you wish).  If you are not adventurous and want the same old stuff, this is not the place for you!  Waiting at a restaurant that doesn't take reservation is also part of the experience.  We went early, also taking advantage of happy hour and didn't wait long.  Our server had much more time to explain various foods we asked about.    We received free dessert in apologies for having to wait for our appetizer.  We didn't think we waited that long but our server thought so...  First she offered free guacamole which we turned down so she insisted on free dessert.    All in all still a great place to eat.  We will back.",

    "text": "I'd been looking forward to eating at this restaurant for several months as it always seemed to pop up when I was looking for places to eat around downtown. This particular Friday night was finally a night where both my boyfriend and I decided that some good Mexican food was in order and we arrived just after 8pm.  We arrive and park in back and had no problems finding a parking spot. We come through the back door which is always slightly intimidating in my opinion but we stroll on through and make our way to the hostest stand. We were met by a man who asked how many in our party and our name. No smile or a welcoming Hello. Maybe he was just having a bad day. We were told we had a 20 minute wait. We walk the 5 steps over the bar and decide to order a beer while we waited. Unfortunately, the bartender had just stepped away and didn't come back for at least another 15 minutes. As we finally order our beer and she hands them to us, our table is ready. We are sat on the other side of the restaurant, near the back of the room next to the waiter stand with the registers and the bathroom. I HATE getting sat back here. I get that someone has to sit there but for me, it takes away from the whole experience of the restaurant and clearly dampens the ambiance. Our waiter arrived after another wait and he must have been having a bad day too because there was no smile, no hello, it was just \"What would you like to drink?' and a quick run down of their menu. At this point I'm beginning to think that maybe this place isn't known for their service and am hopeful their food will make up for it.   We order the tableside guacamole. I get that this is normally an expensive appetizer and you pay for the presentation but for the price, you usually get someone who doesn't have a scowl on their face and using the shabby metal cart that was sitting next to us at the waiter stand. All the extra ingredients for the guac were placed under a towel and once he finished, he placed the towel back over it and wheeled it back into the corner. Fancy. The guac was good but not worth the cost in my opinion. I WILL be adding pomegranate seeds to my own this summer though as that was an interesting addition and would be great in the summer!  My boyfriend ordered a dish that was some sort of pepper stuffed with meat and cheese that he liked but didn't finish, which is a rarity for him. I ordered their house special, the cochinita pibil which is a slow roasted pork with steamed veggies and mashed potatoes. The pork tasted like something that could have come out of my crockpot. Yes it was tender and the flavor was...well, like a pork roast. Nothing special about it at all. The mashed potatoes had some additional ingredients and were the best thing on my plate but the steamed veggies were just that, with a little seasoning. Pretty bland.   Overall, between the lack luster service, sitting in the worst spot in the restaurant, and the okay food, we have to many other places to try and will never be back.",

It ended up being over 45 minutes and while being shown to our table, we passed at least 3 empty tables - frustrating but what can you do?  While waiting for our table we sat at the bar (in the only two chairs that they have) and ordered a couple of margaritas. The bartender prepared them lightning fast but the taste was off and unbalanced. At $12 a pop, a big disappointment.  For an appetizer, the waiter suggested the lobster quesadillas.  The 4 quesadillas arrived on small corn tortillas - each had cheese, a sweet sauce and one bite sized piece of lobster.  A little awkward to eat and at $16, just not worth it.  For entrees, we chose the \"famous\" cochinita pibil (pork) and the chiles en nogada - two dishes that had gotten great Yelp reviews.  The pork tasted alright but was pretty dry - the side of jus added a little more flavor and moisture, but not enough.  This dish came with the super small taco tortillas, and when we asked for a couple extra, we were told that the kitchen was closed.  The chiles en nogada was an interesting dish, but it had so much going on that all of the flavors were muddled:  roasted poblano, chicken, walnuts, apples, apricot, red sauce, almond sauce, cilantro, pomegranate seeds, cheese...    Two hours and $100 later, we left Barrio Cafe unsatisfied and disappointed.",

This was different but delicious.  It forced me to order outside of my comfort zone and so I decided to order a shrimp salad [forgot the name]. It was slices of tomato, red onion, avacado,cucumbers, and a few pieces of shrimp. The dressing was really delicious and worked well. However, for the price I expected maybe a little more shrimp or at least a bed of lettuce.   I do recommend it for people who love to experiment and go outside your average dishes.",

Rushed when it wasn't busy, 20 minute wait for cocktails, no follow up on the food, the \"famous pork\" was essentially boiled, flavorless, dry, without any sauce, pico, cream, zip, none, nada. Server was chewing bubble gum and proud of his bubbles. Once we were served, that was the end. Never came back. We had to go get the check at the front and just left.  Never again. Rethink this one.

    "text": "If authentic Mexican is what you want, this is not the place. It's more like Southwestern fusion inspired by classic Mexican dishes.   I enjoyed the complimentary olive spread served with bread. The spread was fresh and packed with great salty olive flavor. It was more like Italian than Mexican, but delicious!   The margarita with agave was well done (a bit sweeter and less tart, which suits my taste!).  The guacamole is freshly made table side but under-seasoned for my palate. The fresh pomegranate gave it an added texture and burst of flavor. The chips were  slightly thicker, crisp, crunchy, and fresh and not oily. Excellent!   My friend and I ordered chiles de nogada and it had an interesting fruity/savory flavor, but even with walnuts, it lacked texture and was mushy. The poblano was overcooked. The side of pico de gallo and beans that came with the chiles en nogada were dry and overpowered with a cumin flavor.  The scallop/shrimp poblano dish was served with what seemed to be steamed thick cut zucchini that was bland.  The cheesy white sauce overpowered the fresh poblano flavor, which is usually my favorite part!   The flan was very dense (on the dry side) and too sweet. The chocolate cake had a hint of cinnamon and was freshly made with a side of ice cream. It was good. Coffee was fresh and came in a French press. Nice touch.   Overall, the food wasn't altogether bad and had some creative elements. The food definitely didn't satisfy my Mexican food cravings  developed from my childhood memories of eating the 'real deal' in South Tucson.   I would go back with different expectations (Southwestern fusion vs authentic Mex) to try a few other dishes. So far, the only thing I'd repeat order is the guacamole and chips (loved the chips!)...oh, and I'd have a few margaritas on the rocks, too! Happy hour may be my next visit.  I don't mind paying more for something really special. They were a bit pricey at $21 per poblano dish. Overall, we spent $150 for two (including tip).   I will end on a positive note. The vibe was hip and fun, and the service was prompt, friendly, homey, and not pretentious.",

I don't know.... I guess a place that consistently has between an hour and 2 hour wait on a Saturday and doesn't take reservations has got to be beyond fabulous and worth waiting for right? You think? Wow..I am actually embarrased I fell for this. This must be what the people who bought Charlie Sheen tickets felt like...  Sucker! That is what I felt like last night for sure. First off, we had swung by here a couple of different Saturdays but (smartly) decided the wait wasn't worth it...my bf really wanted to try it ( be careful what you wish for)..so we got there (early for us) around 6:45 pm last night to put our name down and do the CRAZY hour and 30 minute waiting game...did I mention the bar area and patio are tiny and you get the added experience of being packed in like cows in an unorganic dairy farm....  Ok..so the food portion of the review...two words...mediocre and overrated...the guacamole was salty...i didn't get to see it prepared tableside because the restaurant was so crowded and small the server (who gets 4 personal stars because she was sweet)...literally couldn't fit the preparation cart anywhere near our table...our main dishes...were just ok.....nothing tasted particulary fantastic and the dining room felt hot with no air circulation...thank goodness for the wine....  This is probably one of the loudest restaurants I have ever been to...I was thinking no way will I be returning..that idea was more than cemented when we saw the glass damage...wtf? Maybe if you took reservations Barrio.. and had a decent parking situation..people wouldn't be sans their car for 3 hours just to eat dinner in the hood.",

There are like 300 reviews of this place?! sheesh)  The neighborhood is ghetto-fabulous, but arriving while it was still daylight comforted me a little.  The food was just as good as I expected! (Thanks, yelpers!)  The guac is to-die-for.  Pomegranate seeds and chunks of avocado....ah-mazing.  I ordered the non-alcoholic \"Mexican Water\" I believe is what it's called.  It is a mix of fresh lime juice and seltzer water in a long neck glass rimmed with salt.  Very refreshing!  Favorite dishes:  the steak with crab dish, the avocado salad (though it is only avocado, shrimp and mango..no lettuce.)  And, the chicken with apricots, nuts, etc.  Delicioso!",

    "text": "Get it? Because it's in the BARRIO??? HAHHAHAHAH.  It's interesting walking by graffiti marked brick walls and chipped away pawn shop signs into a seemingly upscale restaurant with live music and ridiculously priced tacos.  We got a good table on a Friday night and ordered margaritas and the Queso dip to start.  Our server was attentive and straight forward but seemed detached and unhappy.  Like he got called into work that night but really wanted to be playing World of Warcraft and taking bong hits.    Also, why serve bread with salsa as a complimentary app instead of chips and salsa? Are you too classy for chips and salsa, Barrio? You have to be \"different\" by giving us white bread which is horribly filling before a meal? Nonetheless, the salsa concoction was super tasty so I DID in fact eat some white bread with it then I gained 14 pounds then I ate some tacos after.    The margaritas were pretty perfect and I can always appreciate when they're served in cheap Ikea glasses instead of traditional margarita glasses because margarita glasses are, you know, pointless and difficult to handle especially after you've had, like, seven.  Though I'd never order seven margaritas at Barrio because I'm poor and this place is not for poor people.   I got the carnitas tacos and the boyfriend had the carne asada ones.  We swapped a taco each and while they were both cooked perfectly and rather delightful, nothing was very spicy, and I craved heat in everything we ordered.  It's Mexican food, yo, where's the spice?    The ambiance is nice and soothing with hip art and yuppie conversations abound.  The live music was a nice touch and the bathrooms were neat-o; a seemingly ironically decorated homage to cheesy Mexican restaurants, fully equipped with tacky crucifixes and hotel art paintings of the Virgin Mary.  I loled as I peed.   For both of us to eat there, two drinks each, two entrees and one app it was a little over a hundred bucks.  Which is why I only give Barrio three stars because while everything was pretty good, it was not a 100 dollar meal.  I feel I could find a hole in the wall authentic Mexican place right around the corner and get a few pretty awesome pork street tacos, and while maybe they won't have the same quality nor will I be able to listen to soothing Mexican guitar and lol at the ironically decorated bathroom, at least I'll still have gas money for the week.",

Needless to say I was not thrilled to board an airplane with beautiful 80 degree sunny skies and return to midwest storms and freezing wind. Oh well. We had a great time in the warmth and at the festival - highlights included Mumford & Sons, Arcade Fire, Robyn and Lauren Hill.   When I arrived in Phoenix Jed's father Dan was kind to pick me up from the airport and take me to a local Mexican restaurant for lunch. Only after I returned to Chicago did I realize the chef is a James Beard nominee. I probably could have guess though because the food was tremendous (and all the awards/press on the walls helped).   It was a quick meal with a side salad and plate of tacos. I ordered the Tacos de Pescado (Halibut fish tacos with cabbage & avocado, Baja sauce for $14) and I noticed that half the restaurant did as well. The presentation was beautiful and the food tasted just as good. The fish was delicious and I loved the fresh combination of avocado, cabbage and sauce (a perfect compliment to the 90+ heat outside). My starter salad was also nice and had lots of fresh fruits and nuts with a nice vinaigrette dressing.   I'm not surprised Jed was jealous that we made a pit stop at Barrio, the food was great and setting perfect (great southwest food in a rather run down strip mall). The value was great for the tacos, and the rest of menu looked the same. I look forward to my next trip back to Phoenix and the Shein Family residence (and hope a pit stop at Barrio is included).",

The guacamole made at the table was a nice touch, never had pomegranates in my guacamole before! Their acclaimed pork dish cochinita pibil was superb and the pescado del mar was nearly as good. Go hungry as the portions are very generous. Will definitely visit this Mexican favorite again on next trip to Phoenix.",

    "text": "Outstanding food! Great service! Neat place! Live music! Nothing negative to say. We went on a Saturday around 6pm and I think that's just right on time before it get's crowded and you have to wait. The place it's small so big parties may have to be patient and wait. First thing we ordered was the Kuali de Camaron; amazing taste! A combinationof spicy and creamy and all things good, with tastefull chorizo and a perfectly marinated shrimp, the goat cheese just adds perfection to it, all on top of a crispy totopo.Your tastebuds will be very happy; just typig this makes my mouth watery!  You def have to try the tamarindo agua fresca. It's a must. Doesn't feel artificial at all and you can tell it's freshly made, you get the tamarindo pulp in it and the sweetness to it it's the right amount.  Our main entree, fish tacos and chicken suiza enchiladas. The tacos are a very good size and they are great option if you're not adventurous to try something different. They're def satisfying, though. The enchiladas: you get 5-6 enchiladas so it's a very generous portion. They have to be the best I've tried. Just look at the pictures. Oh, this place is not you average price, not a 10dll plate but it's totally worth it. Our check was about $65 for two.",

My DH and I were in PHX for our anniversary and were looking for an authentic sort of down home place and stumbled upon Barrio Cafe.  We went in, sat down, had some extremely salty bruschetta with bread and ordered.  I ordered the chicken poblano torta and my DH ordered the filet torta.  The portions are huge, however, so is the price tag.  Overall, my torta was big enough for 2, lacked flavor, was sloppily composed and not what I expected.  For almost $50 including tip, we should've drove further down the street and found somewhere else to eat.",

    "text": "Wow.   See, I've driven by Barrio Cafe a number of times and thought how good can it be? It's a dumpy looking place...and look at all this hype?   Believe.the.hype.   This isn't some $1 taco place. This is a dining experience. Tableside guac. Queso fundido that is out of this world. Enchiladas suizas so good you'll smack your Abuela. It's that kind of experience.  The staff is very helpful, attentive, and very efficient. Their busser stacked an entire 4 top worth of dishes on his arm and carried it all away....in one visit. It was impressive.   It's SUPER cozy inside so prepare to suck it in a little when you walk by tables to go to the bathroom. The one thing I didn't like was that they had a singer there on Friday night. He was great...but because it's so cozy in there, he didn't need a microphone to sing. But he had a microphone. And he was loud. And it made talking really difficult.  That's kind of a bummer but everything else totally made up for it. The artwork inside is vibrant, colorful, unique and fun.   I really can't wait to go back.",

Coffee is a large canister of French drip.  Very very good.  Service was delightful.  The murals outside adds unique character or mystic to the ambiance as you walk in.  Saturday they have a guitar player, that is good, but very loud.  Parking is tough but manageable.  Service was wonderful.  Our waitress was bright, cheerful and energetic!  Very clean.

    "text": "Not your average mom-and-pop mexican restaurant. Think of traditional options with an upscale twist and other more uncommon options that are just as delicious. They serve a soft bread with olive tapenade as a complimentary appetizer (much like you would receive chips & salsa at a traditional establishment). It was a tasty, uncommon start to our meal.  For appetizers we had the tableside guac - yum! The pomegranite seeds added a nice crunchy pop to the softer texture. Thinking it could have used some fresh minced garlic, but it was great without it too. We also had the Elote - an upscale version of Mexican Street Corn. It was on the sweeter side, but the spice from chipotle or ancho cream helped balance that about a bit.   Husband had oven baked seafood enchiladas - tasty blue corn, a few different kinds of cheeses that packed a big cheesy punch (almost too cheesy for him, but not for me!) All topped with seafood. I chose a signature dish - Chiles en Nogada. It was savory and quite sweet all at the same time. the nuts and chicken in the stuffed mixture added a nice texture to the sweet/mushy fruits. If you really like sweet and savory dishes this is a good one (more on the sweet side than savory). Something fun and unique than what you find traditionally.  It's a small space so if you dine there on a busy weekend be prepared to wait. It is on the pricier side (I guess, depending on what you order). But a Sunday night dinner for 2 will run you about $80 or so.",

It was sweet, salty, warm with little pieces of corn which gave it a nice texture. It was a delicious, perfect soup!  I also got their famous Chile en Nogada. It's a roasted large green chile pepper stuffed with pieces of chicken and dried fruit in this red sauce, topped with a delicious, creamy almond sauce. All the flavors were perfect together, I especially liked the creamy almond sauce. Definitely unique and delicious!  I couldn't finish the horchata, served in a Coke bottle, so got that to go. All in all a delicious meal. Several tables around me got multiple orders of their tacos so that seems pretty popular. Glad I came back again!  Also, they have a location at the airport, I was flying Southwest so if you can't eat here for some reason, you can at least grab the same food at the airport!",

They could have used another server for sure.  There was a boss looking guy standing around but I didn't notice him doing anything but handing out menus and looking around.  I wasn't dazzled by the food, frankly. Not one dish came out \"hot\".  I had the signature pork in banana leaf dish which was \"good\" but lacked diversity of flavor - all I tasted was smoke.  Guac - meh, Esquites - good.  They charged us double for these apps (and were NOT told ahead of time) for our foursome and considering the portions, $40+ was waaay too much in my opinion.  I was in a mood for a great margarita and the server suggested the Low Rider which was a bitter, undrinkable disappointment.  I switched to a shooter of good tequila but the bill still had the $14 Low Rider on it which the server removed when I pointed it out.  The enchiladas were really good.  My friend's porkchop and my wife's carne tacos were nothing special at all.  The churros dessert was really good.  Overall opinion, if a place wants to charge premium prices, the service should be a little more engaging and the food should be as elevated as the descriptions.",

I got stared down by the waiter on my way out after I said thank you when we made eye contact then lost his cool when I went up to him to ask why he stared me down. He called me bro when he was justifying his behavior, I'm 23 and he was at least in his late 30s. He had a problem with my table the entire time. The food did come out very cold.

    "text": "Silvana get in here quick!  They are ruining your spot!  This visit to Barrio Cafe (one of our favorite places) reminded me of what happened when De La Hoya started singing.  His boxing career went to shit.    My wife and I have been a fan of Barrio for a long long time.  We've been back many times over the years and have had for the most part an exceptional meal and service.  This time was an absolute disaster.    The place was half full on a Saturday evening.  We were standing in the bar area waiting for our table.  I asked the bartender for a drink and he was very rude and barely even turned around to acknowledge me.  As I was answering his rudely asked question the waitress came to let us know the table was ready and to come over when we tab out.  The bartender rudely responded for me and said I hadn't ordered nothing.  I did in fact order but you were too unhelpful to make it or turn around and now you are answering for me.    We sit down and place our drink orders again.  We also let the waitress know we were ready to order.  Instead of taking our order our waitress goes and gets drinks.  No big deal.  We wait and wait for the rude bartender to make our drinks.  They finally come and we put in our order.  Now the real wait begins...We waited so long for our food I went to get up and leave but my wife was so hungry she wouldn't let me.  I literally said 5 more minutes and we are out of here.  The food came with 2 minutes left on my phone.  There was no apology from the waitress.  No asking for additional drinks during the wait.  Nothing.  Mind you the place was half empty on a Saturday evening.  Now we know why.  We ordered two enchilada suizas.  They were nothing like what they have been like for the past years.  They were COVERED in cheese.  I'd guess about a pound of cheese was on my plate.  The onions were cut 3/4 inch thick and the zucchini was even thicker.  Yum...HUGE pieces of red onions.  Just what everyone wants to wait an hour for.  The enchiladas were dry and needed sauce and the chicken was extremely dry and overcooked.  I was so pissed I just wanted to leave.  But of course I stay so my wife can order our favorite dessert the churros.  Once again we wait forever.  I'm thinking good Lord forget these damn churros.  They come out and they are really good as always.  After we were done the waitress never came back.  I saw her walk past us after the dessert and go into the little nook in the back so I knew she was back there but she was either playing hide and seek or she took a little nap.    As we wait I see the manager on duty with the busser who has been here forever talking and almost looking like they were congratulating each other on another night well done.  As my wife and I continue to wait forever for our waitress to come back from the grave they didn't even have the decency to ask us if we needed anything or find our waitress.  Yeah, you guys are killing it.  Killing the business.  20 minutes later the waitress comes out.  I signal for the check.  Again, no apologies, no sorry for the wait.  No sorry we suck tonight.  Nothing.    Our bill was just under a 100 bucks for two drinks, two meals, and a dessert.  Normally I wouldn't think twice about the cost but this time I won't forget it.  Best of luck Chef Esparza.  I'm not sure if we just had a terrible experience, or you have too many ventures going on or what but the staff you trusted to take care of this place are just letting your amazing restaurant fall to pieces.  Either way, we wish you the best but due to the food quality and lack of service and respect we will never be back.",

I didn't want a margarita, just a glass or two of red wine. I got their house blend, which was neither merlot nor cabernet (looking for a decent priced wine). It was $17/glass when we saw the bill, after we had paid. I had 2 glasses. THAT'S OUTRA GEOUS! They didn't list wine prices on the menu, which they really should have. I live on the east coast and this is the second time I've eaten here. I adored the food but feel we were taken advantage of. I would only go back if the wine prices were listed. Maybe my bad, but I expect more from a highly rated restaurant. Ergo, only 3 stars.",

    "text": "I am surprised at so many great reviews...'finally tried this restaurant and other than the very nice and efficient waiter Aaron was so disappointed.  The noise was beyond annoying but with saltillo tile flooring and concrete walls it's difficult not to be noisy, especially with a rowdy group of people sitting next to us who behaved as if they were the only patrons in the restaurant - really loud!  The house Margarita was priced at $10 on the menu but we were charged $13 for each ($15 with tip and not worth the watered down drink). The steak tacos are priced high at $17 for 3 mini tacos with some fatty pieces of steak and lots of red onions. One of our group ordered the pork specialty of the house - took 2 bites and pushed it away because it was extremely salty - as if the chef dropped the salt shaker in it. Another had a dish with a not so tender grilled chicken breast and soggy over cooked mixed vegetables. The bill for the 4 of us (including 3 of the house margaritas was $125 but with the salty pork dinner deducted, the tiny tacos and chicken dinner plus an order of guacamole ($14!), plus tip.  We always tip well if the service is even half way decent and never punish the server if we don't like the food.  We were eager to get out of there so the 4 of us could at least have a conversation without leaning in and straining to hear each other, headed for Frost aqua the Biltmore to sit outside, enjoy the beautiful night air on the quiet outdoor patio  and have some gelato since none of us had enough to eat.  Good for this place that so many people seem to think it is wonderful but we won't be back, ever.",

My waitress was very helpful and I'm pretty sure she knew I wasn't a local because I asked the how spicy was their mild lol anyways I got guacamole and chips to start off with. I mean why not! This place looks authentic! And it did not disappoint!!  The guacamole was incredible, it was sweet and salty and limey (not a word). It was everything I never dream of.

The vegan Chile relleno stuffed with mashed potato was filling, yet lighter than a traditional cheese stuffed one. My dining companion loved the chicken mole.

I've been to the Barrio Queen and Urbana, but this is my first run at the Cafe.  It had a more mom/pop feel and very homey compared to the more invested restaurants around town.  I wish they would have kept that feeling, but then again it's what makes Barrio Cafe so appealing.    I brought my friend from out of town to Barrio Cafe on a Saturday afternoon.  They had live music and the place was pretty busy.  We started off with some guacamole which famously introduced to me with tableside preparation and also the inclusion of pomegranate.  Still the best in town for sure!  For my entree I shot for their famous Cochinita Pibil, but taco style.  My friends ordered the Pescado Taco and Mole Enchiladas.  Overall, my marinated pork tacos definitely had some special love to it.  Warm to the bite and the pork was like butter and definitely been soaking in the achiote sauce for quite a bit of time.  The fish tacos were crunchy from the breading and the cabbage while the subtle bite of the avocado helped mellow it out from the aioli.  The mole had a strong cocoa taste, but mixed well the bland corn tortilla wrapped chicken giving a much needed flavor pop!  In the end, Barrio Cafe was voted best Mexican restaurant in the country for a reason.  It's local fare and alluring arts is well worth it as it sits in the heart of Phoenix. - Enjoy!",

When I think of \"Elite\", the words \"refined\" or \"sophisticated\" come to mind.. AND it's a little embarrassing that an \"Elite\" ANYTHING would go out of their way to review an IHOP, but that's Yelp's problem (among many others). Back to the mole.   Mole is supposed to have a smoky, bitter flavor to balance out any sweetness. It is an acquired taste that you should be aware of before ordering it. Barrio is not for you if you aren't in the least discerning.",

    "text": "TLDR: Food good, guacamole great, service lacking.   The Guacamole is amazing here (award winning). There were two main issues. First, the service was very slow even though the restaurant wasn't full. The waiter came out and apologized for the wait after about 30 minutes due to some problem in the kitchen. He said they were very busy and our order was next, but I feel as though they should be prepared for being busy.   I'm vegetarian so I asked him to point out on the menu all the vegetarian options. There were some chicken mole enchiladas that he said could be done with cheese only. When the food finally came out, the enchiladas had chicken in them. If I didn't point it out he may not have noticed, as he was already walking away. Really disappointed that he didn't take the extra time or effort to make sure the dish was prepared correctly.  My friend had the fish tacos which he said were good, the only minor issue being that the breading on the fish could have had more flavor.  My dish came out about 10-15 minutes after that. I think the waiter was genuinely sorry but did not really seem that apologetic. When we got the final bill there was no discount for the inconvenience of having the dish prepared incorrectly.  I just expect more from a place so highly visited and reviewed. This is the kind of service I get from a Cafe Rio type place.",

We got the Queso Fundido (yummy!!), Camaron Tacos, Poblana Torta, and a steak/pork chop dish that my friend swears is the best steak she's ever had and one of those that will 'haunt [her] forever' until she comes back and tries it again (her words, not mine). We waited quite a bit for the food, but it was so worth it. This isn't your typical Phoenix Mexican restaurant where the entrees are crowded with the traditional Mexican rice and beans. Barrio has a more unique twist to it, and although a bit pricy, I definitely see how it's garnered its awesome national reputation.   The restaurant is pretty small, and parking can be scarce. There is street parking on both sides of the restaurant, but it was still easy to manage. One of my favorite parts would have to be the murals ALL AROUND the restaurant. In the parking lot, on the side walls, etc.",

A little on the spicy side, but not too bad since the wife was able to handle it.   She had the Filetito, and it was grilled to perfection. The toppings added to the deliciousness of the steak. She said it was the best filet she has had in a long time.  My choice was the Enchiladas Del Mar. It was fantastic, smothered in shrimp, crab and scallops, topped with a tomatillo cream sauce. You're hungry now, aren't you?  Our server was Aaron, ask for him when you go. Friendly, personable and very helpful. If you are in Phoenix, don't miss this place!",

Some folks might find it over-aggressive, but we really liked it.  Very tender.  The halibut was also expertly cooked and very fresh.    One thing to note about this place is that portions are enormous.   Everything comes out super-sized and it's just something to bear in mind if your party is the sort to each want to order their own appetizer or salad -- it may be best to split these b/c the cumulative quantity of food between an app/salad and a main course is going to be overwhelming.  The tableside-prepared guacamole (which is unusual) looked pretty good -- and came with very fresh looking tortilla chips -- but at $14 (!) we passed.     Otherwise, the food here was well prepared, fresh, and flavorful.",

We sat for probably 10-15 minutes before even ordering. Overall the service ended up being average at best.  No chips and salsa at this place (unless you wanted to order in your own) which was a bit of a disappointment.  Instead they served French bread with a pepper tapenade type thing. The ambience here isn't the most desirable, in my opinion.  Very closed in and felt like we were in a basement in a way. We all ordered the Brunch menu chicken enchiladas. They were served with potatoes and bell peppers. I didn't love that but the enchiladas were pretty good and came with 2 eggs on top. This place was definitely not what I expected. The pricing was more in line with an upscale restaurant but, again, felt like you were smooshed in an old basement.  Glad we tried tried it out but likely won't be a place we go back to.",

And I am face deep in a pile of the most amazing cochinita pibil that I've ever had. True, my cochinita sample size is an N of 1 but still... ridiculously good.  Then, against my better judgement (not that it was in a good place after 4 margaritas), we ordered the chocolate cake and the churro with goat's milk caramel. Ermagerd! Total. Food. Coma.

Main dishes, although flavorful, are incredibly expensive. Their version of Carne' Asada is serving them taco style. It might be Mexican Cuisine, but I'm not a fan.  Their favored Margarita known as the \"low Rider\" will sneak up on you so be careful. It will also sneak up on your wallet at 13 dollars a pop.  Service in the restaurant for us was good but the food came out too slowly so be aware that you might have to wait a while. It's also very loud with hard floors and the place packs up pretty fast.  My advice is to go for a nice bottled beer and share a main course meal OR go at happy hour and save some coin on some incredible good appetizers. At lease you can enjoy the food and not break the bank!  Would I go back again? prolly' not...  Stew~",

    "text": "As you head south on 16th street toward Thomas Rd. it's easy to lose the Barrio Cafe amongst the nail salons, hair salons, and bail bonds (hey, it's a package deal folks!)   Smallish restaurant with tight seating. I can see why people have complained it gets loud. Luckily my co-workers and I were just about the loudest ones there...so my apologies if you were at Barrio today!   I ordered shrimp tacos. I order shrimp tacos everywhere now. I don't know what is going on. Is this a pregnancy craving? I could hop right across the street where they offer free pregnancy tests... just in case.   Anyhoo, the shrimp tacos were the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>. I think the gallo blanco shrimp tacos and these could probably have a Lucha libre-style fight and it would truly be neck-and-neck.   They make their house margy with agave nectar (keepin' it the same plant family) which is a tasty twist. I like agave nectar in my coffee instead of honey...which I used to use instead of sugar. It's the neo-hippie coming out of me.   Overall, decent food, a little pricey ($15 for 4 shrimp tacos) - good serving but at $3 a pop Gallo Blanco might still be the winner. I'd like to come back for brunch - mimosas and chile relleno sounds like a perf Sunday activity. I'd most definitely be back.",

Not sure if the food is authentic, but it's safe to say that Barrio has it's own style! The food is extremely flavorful and the sauces tend to be on the sweeter side. I've heard the food isn't spicy, but my salad actually was.  Sides offered are fries or salad. Quesadillas are open faced on mini corn tortillas. The kids had hard time adjusting to the new look from the traditional quesadilla. I ordered the Tacos de Pollo. They were really good, and the presentation was beautiful!   Don't leave without ordering their G U A C A M O L E   C A S E R O!!!! Made table-side (at dinner only)! It is so good, I would have been satisfied just having that for lunch.  I'm going to try to reinvent it tonight!  Sorry for the 4 stars, but our service was actually HORRIBLE! I think he treated us bad from the beginning since we had children with us. We obviously wouldn't be ordering Margarita's at lunch! Oh well, hopefully he has a better day tomorrow, but next time, I'll request to not be seated in his section!  BTW- 2 adults, 2 kids= $65 lunch...but worth it!",

The guacamole topped with pomegranate seeds was nice and interesting. The cochinita pibil was disappointing. The spice blend of that dish overwhelmed the meat rather than enhanced it. The plate presentations were consistently sloppy and generally were a good metaphor for the overall lackadaisical experience. But the service was what will prevent us from returning. Our waiter \"Marcos\" acted as if he'd rather be wallowing in pig manure than waiting on us. Even something as minor as getting a drink refill seemed to require an act of Congress. He even brought the change back in a wet folder.  Apparently being featured on a Food Network show has inflated the egos of the staff here. The food here isn't all that impressive. The service is what will really leave a bad taste in your mouth. Not worth the hype, the wait or your money.",

However the last 4 times I have been there, service and quality has really gone downhill.    After last night's dinner experience, I probably won't be going back for some time. Prices have always been on the high side, but I didn't have an issue with that when the quality was good.  However last night dinner came to $148 for 2 people -- with no dessert.  Drinks were small and $14 for an average margarita.   My friend and I each had 2 margaritas.  Dirty dishes and glasses were never removed from the table.  My chicken dish was way over cooked -- almost like rubber.  The dish was served with cold unseasoned steamed zucchini and bland mashed potatoes which looked burned.  My friend ordered a steak medium-well.  It came out almost raw on the inside.  When this was brought to the attention of the server, he never apologized and simply grabbed the plate away and later returned with the meat cooked to something that looked medium-rare.  We didn't feel like complaining again.  During the entire dinner I asked 3 times to the server to have our water glasses filled, but it never happened.  I know some places can have an off night, but again this was the 4th time in a row for poor food and service.  I am sad to say that Barrio Cafe is officially off my list.",

Server was quick, friendly and open with his recommendations.  Only a few in our party ordered cocktails (margaritas) and the were very tasty. The iced tea was good, too. Food was excellent; our party tried many different items and everyone was pleased. Start with the guacamole, it's prepared table side; a unique and delicious recipe. As an entree I had the cochinitas pibil and it was very good. The pork was tender and juicy and the sauce gave it just a bit of kick. Dessert was yummy, too; we tried the churros and chocolate cake...churros were the winner, hands down.  They did add an auto-gratuity at the end, which drives me crazy at a nice restaurant for a large, adult party. We always tip, usually better than the auto-gratuity; I resent the implication that we wouldn't or wouldn't tip as well, but maybe I'm just sensitive.",

There's a local band playing music- and they are very good.  We are seated after about 35 minutes.  We are under speaker so the music is so loud we can't talk.  Service staff is very friendly and professional, but also very busy.  Excellent bread and olive dip is delivered.    We order pork tacos and Pollo Poblano dinners.  Our food is prepared well.  Quality is excellent.  But our water glasses are empty for far too long, too often.  It was loud to a fault- likely a combo of acoustics, voices and speaker location.  I like me my loud music, but not so loud that I can't have a conversation at dinner.  The patrons as a whole appeared to be enjoying themselves.  There is a broad cross-section of people, variety of ages, ethnicities, friends, couples, groups, etc.  I enjoy a diverse crowd, and everyone was good-natured, which adds to the charm of this small and very busy restaurant.  Parking is tight but i've never experienced any damage in the back.     I've been a couple times before, and consistently experience a 4 or 5 rating experience.  This is the first time I've reviewed, and wish I could give a 5-star, but no-go.    Yes I will return, but not during one of the busiest times of the week.  No reservations, so be prepared to wait.",

Not only is the Barrio Cafe in what some Phoenicians would called the actual barrio, but it's non-descript on the outside and purely magical within. Not terribly difficult you keep your eyes peeled, Barrio Cafe is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Arizona and is a must try for any Phoenix local.   You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu, although their seafood offerings are my least favorites. I am in love with their conchita pibil, which is their slow-roasted pork and they have the best made-at-the-table guacamole in all of Phoenix. Their food is the kind of special occasion dinner that you and all your guests will be savoring every morsel, but save room for one of their delectable desserts! I'm a fan of their flan, in particular.   Service is spot on and it's usually pretty packed, so come as early as you can or face a semi-long wait at the bar. Don't worry though, they've got great margaritas. This is the place Tempe's Mucho Gusto wished it could be some day. But it probably won't.",

On the way out, I went and thanked the bartender for mixing \"the perfect\" margarita.  I mean it was just their regular margarita, but it was spectacular.  This place is small.  This place has great art (sometimes a bad sign).  But, from the guacamole made table side...with pomegranate...(who woulda thunk it, right?) to each of the tasty desserts, the meal was a complete treat for our entire party of four.  If a Mexican place can't do enchiladas why would I trust any of the other dishes on this expansive menu.  The enchiladas were a delicious blend of scallops and shrimp, blue and white corn tortillas, cheesy goodness served with a side of grilled veggies.  The plate was licked clean.  Looking around at my guests' plates, they were equally impressed.  My wife had the poblano stuffed with chicken and walnuts and apricots and other deliciousness.  Now, for the desserts....think goat's milk caramel...stuffed in a churro.  Think of think crepes, again with the same caramel.  Now, a chocolate cake with the necessary hints of cinnamon and cayenne.  Yes, they have a traditional flan too, but it fell to forth place on this list.  The goat's milk caramel is as good a taste as I have had in a dessert.  Couple this with French pressed coffee at the table and the meal completes with aplomb.  Sure, the small nature of the place will scare some folks away.  No, I wouldn't do a business lunch or dinner here.  But, my wife and I will save nickels and dimes to come again.  It's not inexpensive, but it is worthwhile on value and ambiance.",

Walking into Barrio Cafe, I was afraid I would get stolen and never see the light of day again. Luckily, I made it to the restaurant.   The acoustics inside are terrible. We had a really loud party sitting next to us and I could barely hear the person sitting next to me.   The bread and olive dish they serve complimentary was OK. Nothing great, nothing to write home about. The bread was actually a little hard.   Our server was very friendly, but again hard to hear. We asked him what he recommend and based on his recommendations, we ordered the famous, table-side prepared guacamole, enchiladas de hongos (mushroom enchiladas) and torta de chochinta pibil (pulled pork torta).   The guacamole was fantastic! Very cool to watch it being prepared right in front of you too.   Our entrees arrived and they were both very bland. I've had more flavorful mushroom enchiladas at Z'Tejas. We debated on even taking our leftovers home since we didn't even care for them all that much.   Well, we decided to order dessert since we hardly ate our entrees. We went with the churros and ice cream. They were very good. Drizzled with carmel....delish!   So basically, the guacamole was good and the dessert was good. Skip the entree. Walk with a friend to your car so you don't get snatched. And be prepared to say, \"what?\" all night to your dining partner.",

The street corn appetizer was delicious and makes me wonder why I don't make that at home! Horchata was good but its pretty similar to other horchatas.  Seems simple enough.  Upon walking in, you would think that it was going to be more casual given the cholo murals on the walls outside but don't be fooled...its a different story inside. Its a little nicer on the inside than the murals on the outside suggest. The food is on the pricier side for Mexican food but plated nicely. Portion sizes are decent.",

We only had soups & an order of Queso Fundido but it was all absolutely rich & delicious!  The one thing I would say to remember about this place is it's pricey, so if you are going there plan to spend some cash.  And if you are having adult beverages with it, maybe getting there before happy hour ends would be a good idea to have a couple of drinks at half price before they jump back up to $12-13 a drink.",

The burger was not dry at all and everything that it came with including the fries just went well together! I def recommend!",

Don't recommend the queso fundido, it's a creamy variety and strays too far from the real thing, and $14 to boot. This is a place you go once and don't return for a long time as Mexican food should not cost this much.",

Three tacos stuffed with large chunks of succulent tender pork, perfectly marinated with just the right balance of sour orange.  We also tried the mole, which was rich in flavor, smooth, an exquisite blend of chocolate and chile.  I could drink shots of the mole negro...and did.

But, if you continue being adventurous, looking for that great place you can come back to, time after time - and have flavor and value, service and attention, cleanliness and attention to detail not to mention terrific ambience... El Barrio is it!  First off, if you've never had a table side serving of stand by your table guacamole-making you'll be so impressed, no other restaurant will ever do better for you!  And that's not just about the art, but the taste - Wow!  Plus, they use Pomegranits - another Wow!  So far over the many visits we've tried many of their beverages, alcoholic or not, and we've never been dismayed, so I won't get into their details, but the food is a different story!  Everything from their ice-cold beers, pozole verde, the Oaxaca pateles, just to mention a few dishes are fantastic.  By the way, don't leave without getting their 'Comida Chingona' T-shirt (a riot).  Enjoy, we continue to do so!",

But if we speak about food taste... out of the 5 times I've ordered the Cochinita Pibil, 4 times it was amazing... one time it was very salty. However, overall Barrio Cafe offers a unique and delicious take on authentic Mexican food. The guacamole is truly very good and it's nice when they mix it in front of you and the whole show... however when you're actually eating it you say to yourself \"I can make this guac at home for one fifth of what I just paid for it\".  This place is nice for a date or for anyone looking for a cozy atmosphere, especially at night. Like I said at the beginning... I feel the food is a bit over-priced but if you want to try mexican food with a more elegant twist, then this is your place.  P.S.- The bread with the Italian mixture of ingredients they bring at the beginning is not good. I don't understand why they just don't serve Mexican salsa instead of something that tastes like something you put inside of a Philly Cheesesteak.",

The portions were big and the food was very good, not your regular mexican food which I really liked.   I ordered the famous chile relleno and it was sooooo good, I've had some good chile rellenos in the past but this one was different, stuffed with chicken, cheese, fruit and I believe nuts and topped with this awesome sauce and pomegranates, very Azteca which I loved. The side of mashed potatoes were especially good too, they had a little spice to them and they also gave a side of veggies, the dish was huge. My sis ordered the Cochinita Pibil tacos and those were also very good, three tacos stuffed with marinated pork and topped with pickled onions, what else can you ask for?   Don't forget to get an order of the guacamole while you wait for your food, that too was delicious. We also tried to horchata which was divine and a mixed drink with horchata mixed in it ( I forgot the name). If I ever come back to the Phoenix area, I'd definitely make this a \"must dine\" again. The only thing I didn't like about it was it's a bit small and we waited for a table for a while when the dining room didn't seem too full, and it was a bit expensive, but worth the wait.",

The first time I went there was with the pseudo boyfriend and he adored his meal, and so I embraced it and loved it.  The second time was last night for Dottsy's birthday dinner.    Dottsy and I ordered up the guacamole that everyone raves about.  We were unimpressed, as we had huge chunks of avocado in there and have both made our own guacamole and didn't see what the big fuss was about.    I've had the enchiladas suizas and enchiladas de hongas and although they weren't bad- they were not amazing.  Not worth the 16 bucks, at all.  Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't complain about the cost if it tasted like it was worth it, but not so much.  Because it was Dottsy's birthday, they brought her a complimentary flan which we both agreed was pretty tasty flan.  So, if you are a flan person, this may be a place to check out.  I am not a flan person- too jiggly (which makes me think of what fat looks like on a person's body which stops me from eating it).  The two things that make this place worth going for are the margaritas and the service.  The margaritas are 50% tequila and fabulous- I usually just stick to the house margarita and am satisfied.  The people that work at Barrio are friendly and cool.  I imagine that they all enjoy working there.  I don't really ever need to go back to Barrio, unless I'm craving a serious margarita served up by a cute hipster.  I'd go for a drink or two and then go elsewhere for dinner.",

I wasn't impressed with the guac - so what if some emo guy with horn rimmed glasses stabs at some avocados and other diced veggies with a spoon for 30 seconds? Is that supposed to make me piss myself with excitement? Anyway, it tasted pretty bland... and for $10.50, I think it should taste better. The chips that came with it were a little greasy, but okay.   Our entrees were about 15 bucks each and I almost laughed when they arrived... four tiny pathetic lukewarm soft tacos alone on a cold plate. It looked like something I could've bought on a street corner in Rocky Point for 2 bucks. We had the option of getting salads or fries with our tacos... FRIES. How is that Mexican? We had the salads which were okay...   They only had corn tortillas which I personally don't like. I had carne asada and my girlfriend had shrimp... the beef was pretty good - and the shrimp was okay. The cheese they put on our tacos was kinda gross. Neither of us were really impressed.   On top of that, the place was pretty loud... I guess it's understandable for a small crowded space. Maybe they could've used some acoustic panels or something. My table almost tipped over on me - I just never felt comfortable there at all. I actually felt so uncomfortable I forgot what stuff was - like I had to ask him to clarify what carne asada was (something I order and eat all the time). I just got all confused after looking through their menu. The server was fake nice to us, but I felt hated... we only saw him at the beginning and end of our meal... we kinda got ignored on the drink refills - I think it's cuz we weren't ordering booze (which they make a fortune on).  As food goes, this place is edible, but not good. It's nowhere near worth these prices. It's comparable to the Pink Taco, but slightly less douchey perhaps? Neither place is very authentic (or good). I asked what on the menu was spicy and he said 'nothing.\" They also only have one dish with rice - ONLY ONE - and it's just a special because they normally don't have any dishes with rice. What the hell is that?   I sometimes wonder why people like places like this... it's as though they just like it because the place is crowded and the food is expensive. It's just bland food. Overrated. Overpriced. This place can suck it - I won't be back.",

However, upon our arrival I thought twice immediately. The parking was iffy, and the place didn't seem to stand up to the signage. Perhaps the art was not to my liking, honestly not a piece stands out in my memory.   We were seated immediately.   Our waiter seemed a little off, not to mention the fact that he was insanely snobby and seemed to be moonlighting in the kitchen, where he disappeared for 10-15 minutes at a time. He did not fill our soft drinks once without being first flagged down (those of you who have experienced the close quarters will understand how ridiculous this is).   Halfway through waiting for our food (which took 45 minutes, easily), the lamp above our table went out. We sat in the dark for a good 5 minutes before they even noticed. Which was actually a nice change of scenery from the boring beige walls.   When the food finally arrived, we were too tired (due to having finished an entire bottle of wine) so we left. Unfortunately, we took our grub with us. I had some sort of mixed seafood entree with chorizo and a creamy sauce. It's no coincidence you're taken aback by the combination... it didn't go down too easily. Having dropped 90 dollars on the meal, though, we felt compelled to finish as much as we could stand.   Normally I would make sure I got the name of the dish right, but since I am recommending that you not go there, why bother?",

    "text": "The dichotomy between the \"love it\" or \"hate it\" reviews of Barrio Cafe can be traced back to the concept for this restaurant.  This place isn't trying to replicate the standard Mexican neighborhood joint.  There is also a misconception in the US that Mexican food is universally spicy -- it's not, that's Tex-Mex.  If you're looking for hyper-spicy food, go to Los Dos Molinos instead.  If you're ready for sublime and subtle modern/urban Mexican food, then Barrio Cafe is the place for you.  Just be prepared that a dinner with drinks will not fall into the wallet-friendly category at Barrio Cafe.  The focus of Barrio Cafe is southern Mexican food as reinterpreted by Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza as well as her original creations.  While the food is pricey and the portions have been noticeably reduced recently, you can pretty much throw a dart at the menu and pick out a winning dish.  For appetizers, many diners are beguiled by the table-side preparation of the \"elegant\" Guacamole Casero.  To avoid disappointment, please note that the guacamole is only prepared at your table during dinner.  At lunch, it is prepped in the kitchen.  While the guacamole is good (and even better when pomegranates are in season as the seeds add a tangy crunch), it is a bit spendy at $10.50 for a moderate serving.  Splash out $16 and try the Quesadilla de Langosta Borracha (lobster quesadilla) since it's a unique dish you will be hard-pressed to find elsewhere in Phoenix.  The Sopa de Chile Morron (sweet and spicy pepper soup) is divine due to its silky/creamy texture.  If you ask, they will divide the bowl into two cups so that you can share it with another lucky diner.  The entrees offer a robust and varied selection of delicious dishes.  The Cochinita Pibil (12 hour slow roasted pork) is succulent and well-rounded in flavor due to the achiote rojo & sour orange.  When pomegranates are in season, the Chiles en Nogada (roasted poblano pepper stuffed with chicken, onions, garlic, pecans, apples, pears and apricots finished with a delicate almond sauce and pomegranates) is the standout dish from the menu and my standard order.  The BF's standard order is the Enchiladas Suizas (chicken enchiladas with tomatillo cream sauce).  The seafood enchiladas and the mushroom enchiladas are both excellent choices as well.  For lunch, the Torta de Pollo y Jaiba (Chicken breast topped with crab and spicy hollandaise) is an excellent choice.  It's certainly not low-cal, but it's utterly delicious.  If you manage to spare enough room for dessert, go for the signature option, Churros Rellenos de Cajeta de Cabra (fritters stuffed with goat's milk caramel).  You'll marvel at how they managed to fill the churros with all that tasty caramel.  They also offer a special Domingo menu for Sunday brunch.  The regular menu is also available during brunch, but options such as the Crepa de Pollo (chicken and asparagus filled crepe with a jocoqui sauce) should garner your attention.  Barrio Cafe offers a tremendous selections of tequila.  Their cocktails are all delicious, but be warned that they're strong and pricey.  The BF loves a good Paloma (Patron Reposado with Mexican Squirt soda and lime) and he enjoys the version at Barrio.  I enjoy the mango margarita.   The only negative point is around portion size.  When Barrio Cafe first opened in 2002, I thought then that the portions were a bit small for the prices.  Over time, the portions increased and the pricing seemed fair.  On my most recent visit, the portions had noticeably decreased again, but the prices had not.  Even our Skinny Minnie friends remarked that the portions were small.  Beyond the tremendous food, Barrio Cafe offers a funky atmosphere with \"interesting\" art on the walls.  Sometimes the art is quite good, sometimes it is just plain awful, but it's always a conversation point.  The restaurant is small and full of hard surfaces, so sound bounces all over the place.  It can get quite loud on weekend nights and the live music on the weekends adds to the din.  Try to sit away from the musicians and delight in a rare treat of a near-transcendental Mexican dinner.",

(Guacamole is always different...chunky, smooth, raspberries, cranberries, pomegranate...). I have found that the filet topped with crab cake is probably one of the best in town. My husband loves the Mole here. The deserts have never wowed me, however, the tequila and margaritas are always strong and worthy! Bring your credit cards....its not cheap!",

    "text": "After lots of hype, I decided that I needed to see what all of the fuss was about with Barrio Cafe, so I enlisted a friend of mine (and a Barrio fan) to go with me last night. On the way there, I was issued a few warnings about this place: it's in kind of a sketch neighborhood, and the wait might be a little long as its often packed out. So I thought it was a good sign when I got there and had the thought \"hmm, well, it looks better than south central L.A.\", and there wasn't any wait at all! Granted, it was a Tuesday night, but yaaah for us! It turned out to be a good start to a great dinner.  I started with the frozen mango margarita, which was pretty darn tasty (which for me means not real alcoholic). For appetizers, my friend and I went with the Guacamole  Casero, which was crazy cool cause they make it right in front of you, and the Quesadilla de Langosta Borracha, which is garlic & tequila lobster served on a corn tortilla with melted Oaxacan cheese and queso de cabra. The guac wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was also NOT the worst, so...you take what you can get sometimes. As for the lobster quesadillas, they were pretty darn great, and I don't even like lobster that much! We easily polished them off.  For our entrees, I ordered the Cochinta Pibil, which I would recommend to anyone. It's pork that's been slow roasted for 12 hours with achiote rojo & sour orange with salsa Yucateca...and is apparently how you say \"yum\" in Spanish cuisine. The pork was so tender and flavorful, and came with little tortillas and veggies to make your own tacos...it was so good that, even if I went again, I'd seriously consider getting it again, despite the fact that my friend rattled off at least 5 other dishes that she said were equally as delicious. I don't know, it'd be a tough call. I also tried my friend's chicken enchiladas, which were good, but which I personally thought didn't hold a candle to the tastiness of my pork.   For dessert, we went all-out with the churros, and I can honestly and without any hesitation say that I've never had a churro that delicious in my life. NEVER. Nor will I probably ever again...unless I go back to Barrio. Seriously, these things were STUFFED with caramel. I didn't actually realize that when I bit into it, and was JUST delighted...like a little kid on Christmas; it's GEEEEENIOUS! O man, I could have eaten those things all night...but alas, all good things must come to an end, and so I will savor my Barrio experience rapturously until I get the chance to go back!",

    "text": "I met a group of friends for dinner here and it was a nice dinner.  I didn't break down in bliss because it was the best Mexican food I've ever had nor did angels and cherubs appear.  It was a nice dinner.  The whole waiting situation, to be honest, is annoying.  If the bar area was larger perhaps it wouldn't be or if they took reservations but I hate waiting.  It was only because I like my friends so much that I could do it.  (It was all for you ladies....because I love you. ;))   The wine selection is ok, the tequila selection is incredible.   Our server was very friendly and attentive and all of our dishes were delivered quite quickly to our table.  The tableside made guacamole was ok...to be honest, my husband makes a better guac.  I think it may have been that the avocados were not ripe yet because it was very chunky.  The queso was good, not nearly as good as the queso at El Encanto.   I chose the enchiladas suizas which was very very rich; to the point where it was too  rich.  Much to my dismay there was little chicken and a whole lot of cheese.  I left half a plate of cheese behind when I was done. I did think it was pretty reasonably priced however, we each paid about $35 for our entree, a drink, and the appetizers.    They had live music playing which would normally be a nice touch but we were seated directly next to it and it was very distracting.  I could barely hear my friends over it.  Given the small size of the restaurant and the atmosphere I think the music would be much better acoustic.    I am sure that during my years living in Phoenix I will return here at some point but I don't know how soon it will be.  I would like to take my husband at some point, if for nothing else the tequila selection, but I don't think it would be at the top of the list.",

    "text": "This is my first yelp review and I couldn't think of a better place to pop my proverbial cherry. So I am a creature of habit and the two times I have been to Barrio I think I have gotten the same exact meal from start to finish. I would say hands down just as good as the first time!   Let me start by saying I had never tried guacamole in my life due to the look of the consistency of it. I have a problem with that with some foods. But what better way to try something then being called out by a chick. So, I tried it and it was amazing! Now not having anything to compare it to may make this less reliable, but... The pomegranate that they mash into it was great. It sort of cut through the creaminess. I had the Adobo Pork and for those meat-eaters out there it will not disappoint. For dessert I have had the churro. Unbelievable! For those of us that have only had a fair or Disneyland churro in our lifetimes, this was like a religious experience. It is served very warm with cinnamon ice cream I think.   Be prepared to wait for a table or go later in the night because it is smaller and very popular. Oh yeah, the Sangria is tasty!!!",

This place does it all- and that is high praise after living and eating well in NYC for 2 years.    The first time we tried eating here we walked away because the wait was 90 minutes minimum (Friday night at 6:30 PM).  We wised up and decided to try again arriving Saturday at 5:30.  We had a party of 4- and we were seated without a wait.  The waiter proved to be exceptional - offering descriptions of the entrees that made our mouths water.  We had the guacamole- made table side which was excellent. I have never tried it with pomegranite seeds before and it was a nice twist!   For my main I had the slow roasted pork- Conchita Pibil, which was excellent.  The flavors in the mashed potatoes and grilled zuchini were also stellar.   Someone in our party tried the chiles en Nogada (which is a seasonal dish) and it was excellent also.  We skipped dessert because we were so full- next time I will save room.   I will certainly come back here and highly recommend it to anyone who wants good authentic cuisine in a \"funky\" different atmosphere.  Warning: it can get VERY loud around the bar area- especially on a Friday night.",

    "text": "Incredible Mexico City Mexican food (in, you guessed it, the steadily gentrifying barrio) - with absolutely no hint of regional Southwestern or Sonoran flavor, which typifies just about every other Mexican restaurant in town.  A neat non-descript building from the outside, but a wondrous surprise inside.   White tablecloths aside - it's the little touches that strike you:    * The Coca-Cola in old-school glass bottles ala Mexico.  * The Virgin Mary/Guadalaupe tall pillar candles at each table. * Friendly, professional and candid servers. * The french bread and tapenade. * Your tableside made guacamole which is hands down the most innovative and tasty guac I've had in a while.  And I consider myself a guacamole junkie.   I ordered the chicken enchiladas suiza, which were flavorful and tender covered in a terrific tomatillo crema.  Great choice, but next time I'm having what my friend ordered - the cochinita pibil.   It's slow roasted for 12 hours every day - and the pork just melts in your mouth.  They have a huge tequila list and a Mexican (who knew?) wine list that ain't bad either.  UPDATE - 1/25/07  The Chiles en Nogada (the poblano pepper stuffed with chicken, garlic, pecans, apples, pomegranate and apricot) blew me away!!",

It was my last night in Phoenix and hap and circumstance led us to Barrio Cafe.  My Karma must be fabulous right now, as I tell you without hyperbole that it was the best meal I have ever had.  Filet mignon topped with Mexican crab meat and goat cheese coupled with two top shelf margaritas. I almost balked as I think the margaritas were $9 and the steak $25-ish (more than I'm usually inclined to spend) but hey - last night of the vacation so why not.  I tried to savor it, but I just wanted to gorge myself on it.  It was so tasty that words fail me.  I know that some day if I find myself on death row, this is the meal I will request.  I will not be surprised if the sheer ecstasy of the meal kills me first.",

On food grounds alone its very fine. I had the langostine quesadilla and it was delish: a nice chunk of lobster on each [and there are four 4\" tortillas/quesadillas], in a sweet sauce that was perfectly countered by goat cheese. I tasted the fish tacos - also seemed perfectly matched: the slight heat of the baja sauce, perfectly cooked fish [lightly battered and not at all heavy or greasy]and cabbage...nice. I didn't try the mole but the report was bland. We all loved the guac and the chips. [Two of us had soda, one an iced tea - bill came to $72 before tip for three of us.]  Be warned, this is not a quiet place. Even two-thirds full at lunch, its loud. I could see bringing friends and drinking margaritas, and having the noise just be part of the enjoyment. Now if only Dario would stay home...",

While the food overall was good, it was not spectacular. But decent for Phoenix area. The horchata drink was a little watered down, and the grilled halibut was tender, but expensive at $20. The best part was the table-side guacamole with the pomegranate. The pomegranate had a distinct flavor and crunchy texture that contrasted well with the avocado. The churro dessert was great.  Service: A bit slower than I would have liked, but I recognize that they were busy on Thursday night.   Ambiance: The tables were too small for the 6 of us (they put 2 tables together), and the overall area was cramped. But the live music was really nice touch.   Price: ~$10 for appetizers, $15-$20 for entrees.  Margaritas were really pricey at $10-12 each.   Overall: It's not great value, but the food is decent and the ambiance and the live music makes the entire dinning experience 3.5 stars.",

This is a hard feat considering that chorizo is usually packed with spices and flavor.  When I eat my chorizo and eggs I like to have the option of tortillas not a piece of burnt toast with \"gourmet\" spread on it.  The one positive aspect of this establishment is the yummy mango mimosa.  The drink was a perfect balance of mango and champagne.  The mimosa is the reason why this review has two stars.    Gourmet Mexican food does not mean serving tasteless chorizo and eggs.  Gourmet Mexican food does not mean charging an average of $20 a plate.  This is certainly not the best gourmet Mexican food.  One of the best places to have \"gourmet\" Mexican food would be in Chicago.  Enough said.",

I came with 4 friends on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. No wait, no problem getting a table.  We were served bread which I found odd. Bread with my mexican food? I'd rather have chips and salsa, but I guess bread works. Needless to say we didn't finish it. It came with this tangy salsa stuff. I don't know what all was in it. Maybe roasted red peppers, mushrooms and capers? It was decent. A little too on the tangy side. I ate my bread slices plain. My friend HAD to order the guac. It came with dried cranberries in it. Very basic tasting considering it's added flare. I didn't find it amazing or worth the $10.95 it cost, but whatever. She enjoyed it thoroughly and it got me some chips in the end.  I got the \"Chicken Tacos\" and it came 4 on my plate. Decided to go with the fries instead of the salad, and they were brought out with a chipotle ketchup. Can't argue with the portion size, but I'm not a guy. I actually had left overs so I can't argue with that. My friend got the cardne asada tacos and those looked good. Other friend got some chirizo potatoes and a egg fratata thing off the brunch menu... She liked it. I dunno. Nothing I would order.  I can say that I missed beans & rice and being served chips and salsa. In the end I spent 20 bucks for a diet coke, 4 tacos, a few slices of bread, and some fries... Your call.

(Which is a great thing!)  I sat at the bar and ordered my al-time-favorite drink, Horchata!  Now, now... you ALREADY KNOW it would of been a margarita or two but I was driving and I was driving 30 minutes back home to the East Valley. Otherwise, it woulda been on! I ordered a specialty item on the menu the server backed me up with a guarantee i was going to love it which I absolutely did. The Chile's de nogada is a fiesta in your mouth, reading the description on the menu could throw you off a bit because of the 'pomegranate seeds' but it compliments the meal perfectly. My leftovers heated up beautifully since the portions are large. Service is impeccable but beware that it's still a small, authentic restaurant. The restroom is teeny tiny and it's very dim throughout the restaurant.  I asked if it was ok to take the Mexican coca-coca glass home and our server said yes because they grow them away! Gah! A lovely souvenir.  Barrio also has an airport location which is AMAZING since travelers can try the food without the hassle of finding parking and waiting for a table. No fair! Okay, now I'm craving BC again.",

The staff was be ray friendly and up beat as well.  2 minor issues I had with this place ere the following:  - food portion for brunch was small, compared to other places around town. - initially I wanted an Arnold palmer and I was told that I'll be charged twice for that since the lemonade is home made lemonade, and they mix it with iced tea. Didn't make sense to me so I went with just the lemonade, which was great.   Would definitely come back. Good food for sure.",

We had Carne Asada tacos which was was solid but we were really excited about the guacamole. Very fresh with a S. Mexico flare that had a surprise ingredient. I won't ruin it for you, try it yourself and let me know if you like it. I also had traditional Menudo with meat and hominy. It's a simple dish but executed perfectly.  The staff was very attentive and helpful. Even helped us find items not available on that day's menu.   The dinning area was  a well lit informal room with unique local art on the wall that can be purchased. The furnishings were comfortable and have it a nice sense of traditional Mexico with leather and steal chairs to go with a beautiful antique wooden bar.",

It was sweet tasting thanks to some pomegranate seeds which they decided to include for some odd reason.  The guac was not prepared properly.  I get wanting nice chunks of avocado but this had the consistency of a fruit salad instead of a dip...wouldn't even stay on the stale chips.  All that said, I went with the carnitas tacos and they were absolutely AMAZING.  Each ingredient played so well with one another and the pork was cooked to perfection.  Truly one of the best tacos I've ever eaten.  Service was slow but friendly.  Margaritas were delicious and we caught happy hour (50% off drinks) which made them taste that much better!  Would definitely recommend Barrio but wouldn't recommend their version of guac.",

My family comes from Cuidad Juarez, Estado de Chihuahua and I'm very proud to be Mexican-American. Barrio Cafe instantly appealed to me with its creative use of names in the menu and its new school approach to classic dishes.  However, this place's reputation is greater than what it can deliver. I had the carne asada tacos and they were average at best. My tortillas were dried out and cracked as I folded my taco. Too much time on the comal I suppose. Carne Asada should be flavorful, it should condense the taste of the beef into tender grilled pieces. This place's meat faded into the background of the cilantro and tomato that buried everything on my plate. The carne asada from my neighborhood carniceria out does this place for far cheaper.   The drinks were good at least and that is something. The Jamaica was tangy and brewed rich. That is something...  I also didn't appreciate the wait staff calling me a gabacho behind the bar, either. Nice. I'm light skinned not deaf, lads.",

    "text": "First impression of this place is hard to over come but I felt it was really over priced for Mexican cuisine.  Maybe I didn't indulge in too much of the menu where some would say I should have ventured to and would have had a better meal, but I kept it simple and went with my norm for trying out a new mexican restaurant.   We started off with the critically acclaimed guacamole that stated is \"prepared at your table\" and costs over 11$.  It was good and was composed of the basic recipe, avocados, tomato, onion etc. but had a sweetness of pomegranate  to it that I wasn't a huge fan of.  It certainly wasn't worth 11$, which is the highest I ever had to pay for guacamole and it certainly wasn't prepared at my table as it stated.     I had a few different varieties of the tacos which were actually good, better than most street tacos I've had in the past especially the Carne Asada.  The conchinita pibil definitely made a great taco, but I'm sure the dinner plate would have been a better choice to get the full flavor of the pork.  Over all it was good but like I said it a bit over priced for 3 tacos and fries.    I enjoyed the atmosphere and I'm sure if I went back and tried a few of their drinks and their seafood menu id have a better idea of what this place has to offer.  Over all it was a good, I plan on going back and trying more of the menu but i would probably pass on the guacamole.",

It's a rather unassuming building facing 16th Street (save for the bright purple paint), but pulling into the back parking lot and seeing the colorful murals all over, I knew this place was something special and unique.  As we walked through to the front of the house, I took note of the local artists' works adorning the walls, as well as the Mexican pottery and other decor.  Very nice atmosphere, and I love to see businesses partner with local artists like this.  It gave me a great sense of pride for Phoenix to be in here, like this was our special gift to the world.  As soon as we sat down, we were presented with a basket of bread and some kind of tapenade (?)... in a Mexican restaurant?  My confusion was quickly quashed as soon as I tasted this delightful mixture.  A nice departure from the standard chips-n-salsa you get at other Mexican restaurants.  Since my dinner guest was from out of town (Calgary, AB!), I insisted we start with margaritas and some chips and guacamole, which was prepared table-side.  I was surprised to see our server put dried cranberries into the guacamole, but boy was it tasty!!!  And the homemade chips were outstanding as well.  We both enjoyed our margaritas as we noshed on the chips and guacamole, and bread and olive/pepper mixture.  We both ordered the Tacos de Conchinita Pibil, and the food arrived very fast.  Dios... Mio... Que... Delicioso!!  Soooo succulent, flavorful and delicious.  Phoenix definitely has no shortage of Mexican restaurants, and it surely has the edge on GOOD Mexican restaurants as well.  However, this place is something really special, and several steps above all the other Mexican restaurants out there.  This is where I will take my out-of-town guests from now on.  This is where I will go on special occasions and even not-so-special occasions.  I'd heard so many wonderful things about this place, and all I can say is, they're all right.  I could simply kick myself for not coming here sooner.  It's well worth the hype, and Chef Silvana is a Phoenix treasure!!",

Inside the restaurant they have a bar that offers many different types of tequila and a very knowledgeable bartender. The food was fresh delicious and had the perfect combinations of flavors. The guacamole  is to die for. They add pomegranates into the guacamole which gives it a a little sweetness with the spicy. I had the pork tacos and the park was absolutely wonderful. When I come to Phoenix again, I will definitely have to stop by here.",

    "text": "Disappointed.  I really wanted to like this place, had been perusing the menu onlne prior to coming and was excited to try.  I know going in this wasn't your typical Mexican restaurant and that was part of the appeal for me.  Unfortunately, despite having creative and great sounding items on the menu, the execution was just poor.    I had the poblano pepper stuffed with mushrooms and goat cheese, wrapped in puff pastry.  I also opted to add the mix of scallops, crab and shrimp for a $5 upcharge.  Sounds great right?  Not so.  First of all, this dish was clearly made ahead of time (perhaps days) then reheated.  Puff pastry should puff and be crisp right?  This was flat and soggy.  The mushroom filling was OK but with no hint of goat cheese.  The extra seafood topping was not worth the price.  Yes you got a ton of scallops (bay scallops, not sea scallops), but the sauce was beyond bland, except for hte fishy taste of some of the scallops (again, made ahead and reheated I think).  My husband got the conchinita pibil which was better, but again, clearly reheated.  How do you dry out pork shoulder wrapped in banana leaf?  It was dry, and again quite bland to us.  The bread and tampanade was OK, but not great.  Unlike some of hte other reviews, our service was actally quite good.  Prompt and attentive.  It was a bit pricy, and if the dishes had been executed better, fresher and with more flavor I wouldn't have minded the price.  However, based off this experience, I doubt I'll give it a second shot - unless I get stuck at the airport, then I may try that location.",

I will admit we did not make it over to the 16th Street location, we did eat at the airport location inside the Southwest Terminal.  After talking with a few locals that were traveling, they all said the food at this location was on par with the 16th Street location.    We had guacamole table side, was not impressed, but I think the girl who was preparing our app was new.  Then we move on to the nachos.....  OMG, these had some sort of cheesy gravy I have never experienced before, I have to admit, I pigged out.  My burrito was out of this world; everything seems fresh and hand-made.  Left completely stuffed and happy.  Worth the stop.",

    "text": "Just ate here and will say it was pretty packed but we got seated in about 5 minutes. But it was packed and probably resulted in the poor and sloppy service we got.  Got drinks at the bar and got seated and got special guac that had pomegranate arils in it. The pomegranate did add a nice splash of tang to the guac, only problem I had was that this tableside guac was 11 bucks and the server just used one of the prep bowls to combine everything; we ended up with a bowl with about two ice cream scoops worth of guac and Im trying not to exaggerate. For eleven bucks I should at least get a bowl bigger than what the onions and cilantro came in.  Next was the queso fundido. At first glance we saw a small pool of water and grease so we decided to mix it thoroughly. The cheeses, onion, chorizo, and seasoning was on point, but half the dish was a watery pool and the other half was a stringy mess like pulling a slice off a good pizza: except this was supposed to be a dip. I was expecting a consistency of nacho cheese, where when you pull the chip off, the cheese falls in ribbons back to the tray, absorbing back into the mothership. My cousin said this might just be what queso fundido is, as we both never had it before. I don't know, you tell me, I honestly think that the cheeses weren't completely incorporated yet when they served it.   I got the cochinita pibil tres tacos. The tortillas didn't taste heated up, and it ended up pretty starchy and grainy with the pork, which was seasoned with nice sour pickled veggies, but no sauce. Should've asked for hot sauce! The fries were okay, not really spicy, but the hot ketchup was good.  My cousin had a filet mignon torta and we first noticed that the bottom bun was soaked in the sauce which was slathered on part of the plate. So soggy bun and decent meat was going to be okkkkk, until we tasted that they didnt reduce the alcohol in the sauce enough and it was a real mismatch with the meat. :/ I'm sure it is a good sauce, had they weren't been so busy and overlooked our table.  I am afraid to say that this socal boy tried to salvedge this meal by making my own dish: carnitas fries with salsa, pickled vegetables, and hot ketchup. I tried. Not sure if I'd go again given the chance, but I will say I'll eat that queso fundido again. Drunk.",

The flaca margaritas are delicious and the Mexican Coke hit the spot (and it was half a liter, a nice change of pace from the usual smaller bottle I see). I also was a big fan of the murals out back.

Very simple I ordered Rojas cheese enchiladas for $19 they brought me 3 street corn tortilla with enchilada sauce cilantro sprouts and the 2 eggs over easy that I did order. First thing I noticed sitting on top was the eggs were slightly undercooked this is bad... Can't cook an egg correctly. It was amazing the  corn tortillas had nothing inside I looked everywhere for the cheese even on the bottom of the plate no cheese they were literally corn tortillas with enchilada sauce. Now just think about that to roll up a corn tortilla and not notice anything inside meat or cheese was missing you would have to deliberately wilfully with disregard roll up the tortillas and place them on the plate. The wait staff was undetstaffed they don't have any quality control they serve the plate without even looking at it, really you pick up food you don't look at it before you serve it?... Jack N is correct Chef Esperaza has lost control of this restaurant first time here I will never come back. What a shame.. no way in hell can I possibly recommend this restaurant to anybody...another Triple D disaster.",

After seeing Guy almost melt when he tried every one of the dishes we couldn't wait to try the food.   The bread and salsa they started off with were ok. My husband loved the salsa but I wasn't a big fan.   We ordered the guacamole and thought it was kind of bland. It was missing salt and lime. The pomegranate seeds were good in there after we added more salt.   For our entrees we ordered Cochinita Pibil and the torta with Cochinita Pibil. We both thought that the flavor on the pork seemed washed out. The veggies and the mashed potatoes were good but took away from the authenticity of Mexican food. I was really looking for food similar to food on Mexico, not Americanized Mexican restaurants.   Something else that turned us off was that my husband asked for a spicy salsa and they brought over Tabasco.   For the price we paid the food was not as good as Guy made it look on TV.",

It turned out to be one of the most disappointing and bad visits I have ever had. It was very busy when we arrived which did not surprise us at all as we had heard so much about this restaurant. We ordered or drinks the bartender forgot one of the drinks and was rather rude about asking what the drink order was.  We ordered shrimp quesadillas and queso for the appetizers. They were tasty and arrived as expected. A nice start to dinner.   Our mains were duck breast and mole chicken breast. At least a half hour later our mains had not arrived, our section of the restaurant had emptied out and our server had disappeared. We were discussing tracking down our food and a new server arrived with our food. I took a bite of my mole and is was very cold and the polenta was the same temp as was when it had been recently refrigerated. I then tried my boyfriend's duck which was also cold. I got up and found a server in the next room and all I said was  'our food is cold\" she, with out a word, removed the mains from our table. Our server eventually returned and we okay with waiting for replacements. They arrived at the proper temp sans the polenta with extra veggies. By this point the restaurant was empty except for a few tables. The meals were flavorful and complex.   They comped our dessert for our inconvenience.    I have only been to a few James Beard award wining restaurants but cannot imagine Chef Silva would win any awards for her Cafe today.  In a metro area as big as Phoenix there must be hundreds of restaurants which would offer a much better experience then Barrio Cafe.",

The bread was really cold, and not a bolillo. More like a dry wheat focaccia. Maybe searing the bread with some butter prior to building the sandwich would go a long way. The pork itself was good. Really tender and flavorful. I'll probably be back, but will go with something else..",

    "text": "The four Jolly Diners slipped into The Barrio Cafe just as it was getting busy for the evening. It was recently rated as the best Mexican restaurant in the Nation and we really wanted to see why. First, the waiter made fresh guacamole right at our table which was served with chips. Fresh bread and tapenade were also served. Both were delicious. For entrees: I ordered the Posole Verde which had pork in it. I missed that on the menu so immediately removed that and it became meatless. My aunt had the Esquites (Buttered roasted corn kernels topped with chipotle cream). Sister ordered Tecate beer battered fish tacos, and mom had roasted corn chowder. It was all well prepared and delicious. It was easy to see that the dishes at The Barrio Cafe are unique and delicious. It is certainly not the typical Mexican restaurant experience. The Jolly Diners revommend The Barrio for anyone wanting a truly above average and uniquely delicious Mexican cuisine experience.I now really do understand why it was rated as the best in the nation.",

They were mini tacos with one thin piece of fried fish with little flavor. Batter wasn't good to me. The size of the tacos were the size of HH tacos I get back home in Seattle for $1. I love fish tacos and cannot resist them when they are on a menu, but these sucked.  My uncle got the suizas enchiladas. He said they were just OK. I tried some of the zucchini side that was in the sauce, but I thought it was decent. A little overcooked zucchini. Overall, just OK.",

I've enjoyed brunch, lunch & dinner at the original Barrio Cafe on 16th St.  The menu doesn't offer the usual food you might expect at a Mexican restaurant, it's a regional cuisine with Chef Silvana's special twist.  I haven't been disappointed yet & this review is making me hungry!  Brunch is my favorite meal, & the brunch menu is outstanding.  I highly recommend the Barrio Cafe.  There are 2 other locations, one at the airport & the other is on Grand Ave",

    "text": "I visited this place for the 1st time a couple weeks ago after seeing it featured on The food networks Diners, Drive In and Dines.   I happened to be in the area and wanted to try it out. The outside looks great there is murals painted all over the building. When we walked in the place the first thing we noticed was that is was a small little cute place. It doesn't feel too inviting and there isn't much decor.   1st off we arrive and we weren't greeted until a few minutes later. Once we were sat we wait at least 10/15 mins until we are greeted by our server granted it was a busy day. Only half of our table actually received the drinks they ordered and our server took forever to bring us our drinks/apps/ food! The service was sooooo slow not as friendly as I would have expected it to be given that it's been featured on national television and for the over priced food this place has I expected wayyyy better service for the staff!   Okay well now on to the food!!!  For apps we ordered:  -Guacamole: it wasn't the greatest the pomegranate seeds did add a good kick to it but the guacamole overall had no flavor it was missing lime, salt, & pepper and just flavor in general.   -Equites: (Roasted yellow corn with garnishing) this was good it came with spicy mayo cheese and lime.   Entrees:  -Fish tacos: Were really good the fish was fried and had great flavor but nothing out of this world.   -Chilaquiles: they came in a green sauce with an over easy egg on top. I've had way better Chilaquiles else where. These weren't crunchy they were a bit mushy which I didn't like at all and you could somewhat taste the oil in them.   -Chiles en Nogada: my sister ordered this because everyone raved about how great it was, the plate failed to impress us! It wasn't as amazing as everyone said it was. It was all sweet but no savory in it...what ruined the meal for my sister is that as she was eating it she found a produce sticker still on her chile!!! It was such a disappointment and made us all think twice on how unsanitary and careless this place maybe. Given that's they can't even take the time to wash their produce correctly!    - Enchiladas Suzias de pollo: my brother order this and he said they were alright not really worth $20. There was nothing special about them that you can't get at any other place.   -Cochinita Pibil: we all agreed that this was the best meal of all. The meat was pork, the portion of the meat was big and had great flavor. Overall was a very satisfying plate. It did come with side dishes mash and veggies.   As for all the other dishes they weren't anything amazing! This place is just over priced because it's been featured on TV and it falls short of service and flavor! I wouldn't go out of my way to try this place again. There are other places that are 10Xs better for half the price and better service!",

Saw the DDD show highlighting that dish. However actuality was like an olive and pimento on the plate. And no evidence of the Mexican flag. Plating was horrible.  Happy hour drinks good and my pulled pork main course was excellent.  The wife however was not pleased with her flag dish. Review is based on pricing too. Just because you got on TV doesn't mean you should charge celebrity prices for Bundy portions. Get real.",

We went a Saturday night so once inside it was very packed. We only had to wait fifteen minutes even though the hostess said thirty to thirty-five. Out of the four of us, two of us weren't impressed with the menu. I was willing to give it a try. Live music was playing loudly and I didn't mind, some of my party did. Our waiter was attentive for the first half of our service. Very busy night. The moment he mentioned they don't serve rice or beans, the disappointment went up. I'm just like.. are you serious? But I got fries as a side to my tacos. Three tiny tacos with so so carne asada with toppings and a small plate of fries and it was $13. No. One of the other members of my party, their plate was $32. The atmosphere is nice despite the hipsters which should have served a warning to me for the food. Same goes for the bread at the table. My first thought was, \"where are the chips\"? Overpriced for mediocre tasting food. Needless to say we all agreed we wouldn't be back. PS The queso fundido is the only thing that was really good.",

    "text": "We went there for dinner on a Thursday night, which I'm sure helped because we didn't have to wait at all to get seated.  I ordered the Suiza Enchiladas and my girlfriend ordered the Carne Asada Tacos.  The enchiladas were $19, which I thought was a bit expensive.  In fact it was more expensive than any enchilada I have ever had before.  But then I tasted them and immediately realized they were worth every single penny and then some.  They were cooked to perfection and the flavor was unique and amazing.  They could have used a little more kick, but that didn't really detract from the experience at all because the flavor was so good.  The Carne Asada tacos were certainly above average, but didn't quite knock our socks off the way the enchiladas did, though we don't really have any complaints about them either.  We then decided to try dessert.  And after deliberating for several minutes, decided on a $12 churro.  We both thought \"for $12, it better be the best churro ever.\"  Well, it was.  It too was worth every penny.  In addition to that, the service was impeccable and the experience overall was fantastic.  I can't believe I waited so long to go to this place.  It is now one of my favorites and I can't wait to go back.",

The AAA guide sent us here; it did not disappoint. We had kind of a long wait, but we ordered drinks from the friendly bartender to pass the time. When we were finally seated, we promptly ordered the guac. It was fresh and delicious-the pomegranate seeds added a nice touch. I got the chicken enchiladas suizas, which were also great. Hubby got the grilled tacos; they were also fresh and tasty. I have no idea when I'll be in Phoenix again but if I ever am I'll go back!",

    "text": "I have gone to Barrio Cafe a few time because I keep wanting to feel differently about it. It is in Central Phoenix which is fine but it is difficult to find a place to park. The decor of this place is my favorite they have so much beautiful art from local artists everywhere. I even love their slogan but alas \"Comida Chingona\" it is not. The first time I went I had the \"Enchiladas de Mole\" but really 18$ for four small Enchiladas the second time I had  the Mango, Tomate & Camaron salad that was also ok but 14$ for 6 shrimp. We also ordered the \"Guacamole Casero\"  they make it at your table but it was poorly made and then they added dried cranberries I still don't know why they do that. One of my friends ordered the \"Cochinita Pibil\" that was also just ok. I think the idea and decor are awesome but the food is just really not worth the price. I would be OK with paying good money for Great food but this is just not the place for that.  My table was full of people from Mexico City and Guadalajara Mex needless to say this did not fill the craving we had for fine Mexican dinning. The place is small and a little loud but I don't mind that at all, it was the food that really disapointed. So I will get my Comida Chingona elsewhere because Barrio Cafe sadly did not have it.",

I've been twice at lunch time (December of 2005?, and November of 2007).  Neither time was busy (maybe that was key).  Portions were never small.  Ranged from good to great, with a couple of snags.  First time was the best.  I wanted huevos rancheros, but order didn't get to the kitchen in time, but the posole and some sort of pork tacos I ordered instead (yes, I like pork) were awesome so it was okay, and I still dream of the best caramel filled churro I've ever had (the flan was not so memorable).    Second time, my tamarindo was fermented, so ordered a mexican coke.  Queso fundido was good.  Posole was good, if maybe a little bland compared to the last time.  I think I had tacos with some sort of porkt again, which were maybe a little disappointing compared to my previous visit, but I'm not sure because I was uncomfortably full at this point.  My dining partner was very happy with the chicken w/mole.  Poblano mole is not my thing, but I sampled it (spicy, chocolaty, and good in my uninformed judgment).",

Fresh, fresh, fresh ingredients and expertly crafted sauces. Chef Silvana is a goddess and knows her way around a kitchen. Also have to mention their truly top shelf from-scratch margaritas (they do them right).   The bad: too small, too crowded, no reservations, and the live music in that tiny space, which would be very enjoyable anywhere else, makes it impossible to talk to your date. Also parking is sketchy... much like the neighborhood.  Would I still go back? Of course. Can't get enough of Silvana's cooking, but it's literally an \"I will tolerate this annoyingly inadequate space for this delectable food\" situation.",

But the dinner menu charges more than $13 for three tacos, served with soggy french fries (or salad), served with a ketchup which seemed to maybe have some canned chipotle tossed in. Not impressive at all.  My water glass was not filled for almost 30 minutes. I finally flagged down a bus boy to fill it. Our waitress seemed too distracted to give us any attention, and she forgot to bring out an extra side of ketchup for me. The portion was tiny, but it didn't matter because it wasn't very good anyway.  If this was a $2 taco joint, I'd be OK with everything. But at the prices they charge, they had better step it up. And they did not do that.  I won't bother going back. I know of a taco truck at the Lowes parking lot in Prescott that makes killer tacos for $2 each, with plenty of amazing salsas. I'd rather ride up 89 to Prescott and enjoy the tacos when I get there.",

    "text": "What a great experience!!  While producing a conference in Phoenix, I wanted to take the staff out for a great time at a restaurant and with food that we can't get in Detroit.  In my research, I found Barrio Cafe, and so glad I did.  I called ahead days before and were told THEY DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS.  And they are NOT kidding about that, so be prepared to wait. It's a small, yet very popular place, but worth the wait.  While we were waiting, we ordered chips, salsa, and guacamole.  All three were great, but the guacamole with pomegranate seeds was phenomenal!  Living 3/4 of the way across the country, I am definitely going to try to recreate it at home.  Once we got our table (there were 7 of us and we had to wait for 2 side by side tables to clear out), our service was friendly and efficient.  They served fresh white bread with an olive tapenade.  Several of us had read up on Chef Silvana, and were excited to try her creations.  I ordered the Cochinita Pibil.  Reminiscent of my family's North Carolina Appalachian pulled pork, it had a Mexican flare that was unique and delicious.  It was even served with a thin \"dip\" rather than a thick bbq style sauce.  Outstanding.  Another of our crew ordered the Chiles en Nogada and we traded bites.  It was also outstanding. Fruity and flavorful.   After dinner, we took a group photo in front of the artwork on the side of the building.  I will definitely go back if I have the opportunity.  Thanks for a great experience.",

First, our waiter, Cesar, wasn't too friendly and had attitude when we were asking questions about the menu. We were surprised to get bread and diced olives instead of the typical chips and salsa. When our drinks came out, we were disappointed in seeing the size of them. You pay $5 for a soda and expect larger sizes and free refills. My niece ordered juice and got the wrong one so we had to ask the waiter to replace it. We were hungry and waited nearly an hour for our food. Then, when our dishes came out they weren't what we asked for. We ordered the chilaquiles with scrambled eggs but they were sunny-side up when the dishes were brought to our table. Portions weren't too bad but expected more for the prices, no beans and rice! My niece and nephew ordered the chicken enchiladas but they had very little cheese on them. The kids left most of their food as it was mainly tortillas covered in sauce with a few pieces of chicken. As if that wasn't bad enough, for 3 adults, 2 children and 4 month infant we were charged a 20% gratuity. Needless to say our experience was not worth the $115 we paid. Never going back again!

Everyone who helped us was very nice, but man... the food was subpar at best. The guacamole that we saw so much praise for on here stumped us from the get go. It isn't mashed in the slightest and is instead large chunks of avocado with equally large bits of onion, pomegranate seeds, and other mix-ins. Maybe we're spoiled because we're from California, but this dish shouldn't even really be considered guacamole as far as I'm concerned. I got the carne asada tacos and my friend got the suiza enchiladas. Both very average. Neither of us got drinks, and our bill was well over $50. It was such a miss. We definitely regret stopping by and urge you to look for your Mexican food fix elsewhere.",

    "text": "I cant say that I am impressed, but for Phoenix, id have to say I enjoyed it. Since I got pregnant all Ive wanted was mexican food. Okay, more like the delicious burritos I used to eat in the bay area when I lived there, but still, I wanted mexican food. So, I settled for some tacos and barrio had some yummy sounding tacos.  I had high expectations and maybe that was one of my problems. Although I gave it four stars, I have to say it is just because it is here in Phoenix that it got four stars. If it was in the bay area, it may have only gotten two. But here in phoenix it is hard to get decent food, and I have to say if I need tacos again while I am here I will go back to barrio to get them. Wishing all the while I lived in the bay area again, but thats besides the point.  So my brother and I pretty much knew what we wanted when we got here. We waited outside with our dad and his girfriend for an hour before the restaurant opened for dinner.   to drink- wanted a margherita but couldnt order one damnit- got the hibiscus drink. very tasty. tangy and refreshing. heard the margherita was good from my brother and the beers my father had were refreshing for him as well.  I wanted to try the lobster quesadilla for an app and so ordered that. my father ordered the queso fundido.  I was disappointed in the quesadilla- kinda cold and not much substance, especially for the price. BUT I was impressed with the queso dip. SO yummy I couldnt stop eating it. slightly spicy and very cheesy. mmmm. loved it. tho there were a few stale tasting chips which were kinda offputting, no one else seemed to notice. guess I got em all.  For entrees, though I was halfway through the dip and getting fuller as each second passed, I decided to stick with what I originally wanted to order, as did my brother. I had read earlier that the portions were small- well that is not so. each taco plate came with four tacos. and some with fries. fries? yuck. had to pass. but the tacos!...  I ordered the shrimp tacos- so fabulous so glad I ordered them- and the chicken tacos that were not on the online menu and made me change my mind from steak to chicken- were yummy yet was sooo full didnt really enjoy them till I ate the leftovers the next day. My brother orederd the pork tacos- extremely tasty if I do say so myself- and the filet mignon torta- which wasnt what he expected and I myself couldnt really stomach (meat was a little on the sweet side and way too much bread.) dont know or care what my dad's girfriend got.  my dad got the chile relleno which he seemed to enjoy but complained it didnt have all the shellfish in it that it mentioned, a couple shrimp but no scallops. i think he wasnt impressed after waiting an hour to eat here.  overall it was satisfying. although completely overstuffed when I left, I will know better next time. dip for appetizer and ONE taco plate.",

    "text": "My party of 5 dined at barrio on a Wednesday night and had a nice dinner, including a fantastic order of guac.  The restaurant was very busy, so we had our well below average tasting margaritas on the front patio.  The 45 minute wait would have been easier to take had we received our guac and chips in a reasonable amount of time.  The bartender forgot about the order, so we didnt get them until we were seated for dinner, about 45 minutes after ordering them.  Our service once we were seated at our table was very good. Our server offered many good suggestions and the meal came quickly.  Overall, we enjoyed our evening and were pleased with dinner. The main issue was with the bar -- the solo bartender was very busy, so I suppose there was some justification for the poor service and poorly made drinks.",

Get the guac!! it's so good... it's sweet with pomegranate seeds (i think), spicy with jalapeno, and just delicious.... it also has cilantro, avocado (duh), salt, onion.... it's great! So I usually get the pollo poblano which is delicious chicken with goat cheese and tomatillo sauce.... yum. But today we wanted to try something else so we tried the cochinita pibil at the waiter's recommendation. I am so glad we did! It is slow roasted pork that is roasted for 12 hours.... it just fall apart and yet is so juicy.... It was delicious. It came with spicy mashed potatoes and zucchini. It was all delicious. The pork came with little tortillas to wrap it in and then I put the guac on top.... whoa. Delicious. I will continue to go to this restaurant because although it is expensive... it is so worth it!",

We went for happy hour (from 3 to 5 Tues through Fri) and started with the tequila and lobster quesadillas for the table. Then we all ordered the $1.50 tacos in various forms. We all thought the halibut taco was the best, closely followed by the roasted pork tacos, but they were all outstanding.  We also had most delicious $6 margaritas I've ever tasted. Oh and the guac...not traditional, but fantastic. I would never have thought of pomegranate seeds in guacamole but I loved it.  Save room for the flan. I usually pass on flan but my brother insisted, and it's the real deal.",

There was live music, but it wasn't so loud that we couldn't have a conversation at our table. The food is very good and unique.  For example, the guacamole made tableside contains cubes of avocado, chopped red onion and cilantro, lime, and pomegranate seeds. I had a delicious torta with chicken, poblanos, and onions - my daughter had beautiful chicken tacos.  The prices are not inexpensive, but the portions are huge!  The atmosphere is fun and although the neighborhood looked a little iffy, we felt comfortable parking in the back and walking around the corner.",

The door opens to a tiny bar, make a left onto the dining area to see the decor is cheap and dated.  All the diners were white, which gives one the feeling that all the Mexicans are somewhere else, eating better food and paying reasonable prices. Guacamole is over $12, it's the same as you can get anywhere else except the put a few pomegranate seeds. It was good.  I had the carne asada tacos which were fine but no different than you can get at any fast casual mexican place.  The service was fast and courteous.  It was unsettling to find barrio cafe at the airport right in my terminal,  and the prices were nearly the same.   The owners of this chain are building their wealth one over priced taco at a time.  Throwing in a few almonds and pomegranates into standard mexican fare and charging 50% more doesn't make you an innovator,  it makes you another greedy restauranteur who doesn't care to reinvest in their business.  No wonder the menus online don't list any prices.  I will not be back.",

Really, enough has been said here about the food, or atmosphere, or whatevs ... but if they're hoping to leave a legacy in Phoenix, its with these two items.

Anyway, we arrived and it was like a 35 minute wait which was fine because we excepted that on a Friday evening. We got seated at a table RIGHT IN FRONT of the guitar player. I mean, he was playing some jams but is it necessary to have tables so close to where he's performing? Could barely hear what my friend was saying.  I ordered the carne asada tacos with the spicy fries. The fries were pretty good with that sauce you dip them in. The tacos were kind of bland though and small. You get complementary bread and some olive mixture that I didn't know were olives until I tasted it. Not a big fan of olives but the bread was soft. All in all, I was pretty underwhelmed and probably wouldn't go back. If I did, I'd maybe try the enchiladas that my friend had. Hers looked good.",

So, juicy and tender, I would've like to order a second one, but it's quite filling.  It also comes with spicy fries, which I was open to, but a little hesitant about them.  The fries  come with a house made ketchup that is the best ketchup I have ever had, without exaggeration.  They were super good even when I ate them 2 hours later at the airport.

    "text": "Even the approach to Barrio Cafe screams cool - the building is covered in murals that are stylish and cultural.  You can enter from the front of the strip or from the back, where there is more parking in case you can't find a spot on the street.  The space is cozy and intimate - tables are packed close to each other which leads to an atmosphere of some comradery, and makes you talk more intimately with your table partner.  The artwork in the restaurant is for sale and beautiful.  Several diners, including myself, were eyeing them all meal.  My husband and I had scoped out Barrio Cafe in our research of Phoenix restaurants that we wanted to go to on our trip for a long weekend - it made the top of our list.  We were seated immediately and had some of the most incredible food.  We each ordered a soup - I got the roasted red pepper soup and he got the ship and corn chowder.  Both were rave-worthy.  The portion sizes for the soup were honestly big enough that we could've walked away satisfied, but we had already ordered main courses.  He got the pork tacos (cochinita pibil) and I got the filetito torta.  The torta was ENORMOUS and I went home with leftovers.  The filet was spiced so wonderfully it tasted just as good on the second day as on the first and was grilled perfectly.  My only piece of feedback was around service, as our water glasses sat empty for a long period of time.",

Stopped by for lunch and not only had great food, but also enjoyed some fantastic live music.  - Esquites- sweet corn made even better with cream, cotija, lime, and a bit of chipotle heat - Barrio Salad- ooh tasty, sweet raisins, spicy dressing. nice to have something on the healthy-side that is full of flavor - Shrimp quesadilla- 4 corn tortillas topped with 1 perfectly cooked shrimp each and a ton of creamy cheese. These were good, but would have been even better with a bit of hot sauce. - Chiles en nogada- a huge green chili stuffed with goodies that gave it tons of different textures and flavors.  - Calabacita enchiladas- these were my fave of the entrees. Four corn tortillas filled with squash and covered in creamy cheese. These were rich and filling so good to share, but soooo good. - Chilaquiles de mole- The mole sauce was tasty so I'd order it on some of their other dishes, but I think I like traditional chilaquiles better. The sauce was thicker than red chile sauce usually is and the egg was fried hard, not over easy with a gooey yolk, so the tortillas were crunchier than I expected. Still good, but I'd go with the traditional next time.  The staff was really friendly and the vibe really relaxed. Would recommend!",

The dishes are also great--Mexican food with a French twist. My favorite has to be the duck, which comes with mashed potatoes and zucchini squash. Well-seasoned but not overdone. They don't take reservations here, but so far I've been lucky and managed to get in pretty quick.",

These tacos had a small nugget of breaded fish, that filled a third of the tortilla. Instead of serving three tacos serve two with FISH that fill the whole tortilla up. The fish could have made one taco on this plate they served me. I hope the owner checks in on their business and reevaluates this plate. It's a True disappointment to say the least. If you are looking for fish tacos look elsewhere like Rubio's, you will be much happier. This is not the place for fish tacos even though it's a main meal on their menu.",

But Richard was amazing. He was patient in taking our orders, gave great suggestions and answered all of our questions about the menu.  Service was quick and the carne asada tacos I ordered were excellent.  You wouldn't think fries in a Mexican restaurant would be a thing but they were some of the best fries I've ever had.  I will say one drawback to this place is it is a bit on the pricey side but totally worth it.  An extra bonus is all the street art around the building which is what brought me to this restaurant in the first place.",

Not that Mexican food isn't super tasty, because it is.  It's just that it isn't usually served with much explosive flair or out-of-the-box creativity.  (I mean, we've all come to know what to expect.)  That is until you've visited the Barrio Cafe.  When here, forget what you've known, what you've grown up with.  At the Barrio, Chef Silvana's sophistication and assertiveness with the culinary traditions of Mexican cuisine challenges any and all notions of south-of-the-border authenticity.  Imagine: apples, pears, dried apricots and pecans nesting harmoniously amidst savory chicken, enveloped in a roasted poblano pepper and finished with a light almond sauce, the colors of the Mexican flag (cilantro, queso fresco, and pomegranate seeds) artfully decorating the myriad of flavors...  \"Chiles en Nogada,\" as explored by Guy Fieri's \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives,\" is the signature dish that brought me to the artistry of the Barrio.  And it is also the \"Chiles en Nogada\" that has forever now changed what I thought Mexican cuisine could actually be.  Chef Silvana certainly has an eye for presentation.  To visit Barrio Cafe is to appreciate that vision.",

We went for brunch, hubby loved his pork chorizo & eggs calling it very flavorful and a decent portion while I had the chicken mole. The plate also offered some veggies & a squash puree mix. It was very tasty but the chicken was a bit on the tough side, like it was cooked too long. The chicken mole plate was about $23 but it's also not something I wanted to whip up at home that weekend. The ambiance had a cool vibe with supercool art paintings for sale, live entertainment and decor of traditional rustic finishes.  Parking is limited so be prepared to park in a neighborhood on the street if you do not take public transportation. Four stars because of the tough chicken & a not very friendly server. Server was either too busy/distracted or just bad at her job. Despite explaining it was our first visit, she just wanted to move the process along without any discussion on their offerings (food or drink) or what made Barrio Cafe special. Needless to say we didn't feel like begging her to discuss a dessert menu.  Our brunch with two plates & one drink was $45. We are not likely to return.",

    "text": "Conserve water. Drink tequila.  When in Mexico. Si. When in the Barrio. Si. Si. Si.  Enter through the back where you park.. and sit in this artistic gem of a restaurant. It's tight. So suck it in. The strum of a guitar played as we tucked ourselves into our table. There is live music here from Thursday thru Saturday in the evenings and adds to the ambience. A very nice touch to this quaint place with amazing food. It's definitely tight in here. It reminds me of cafes in Europe. You may or may not get to know your eating neighbors. So since we are conserving aqua.. I started with the Paloma. It came delivered by our friendly waiter with a salted rim and consisted of Patron Reposado Tequila, Mexican grapefruit soda and fresh lime juice. My husbands house margarita was legitimately worthy. We started with the table side guacamole. Our waiter rolls up and makes this with whatever you like. Pomegranates? We will pass. But everything else and it was perfect with awesome chips. The bread and an olive spread paste that was complimentary for the table was very good too. The menu is so diverse and some of the best native Mexican dishes from Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza that I have seen outside of Mexico. It's truly hard to decide on one thing! I ended up ordering the Enchiladas del Mar. These enchiladas are blue corn tortillas  filled with quesos of Oaxaca and de cabra, topped with lots of shrimp, lump crab and scallops in a tomatillo cream. I had the scallops held and that wasn't a problem. One small issue after they were delivered, is that I wanted a salsa type sauce. My waiter seemed either confused or taken aback. I even pointed out the sauce/salsa on other plates on the table and he pretty much just didn't bring it! Cmon now! The enchiladas were amazing! I just wanted to 'salsa' them up a little.. okay. So, one of the other people got an extra salsa and simply passed it to me. As, he simply never brought it. While dining the Filet de mi Tita arrived at the table next to us. I have never been one to go to a Mexican cafe and order steaks.. THIS time.. its on my 'to go back and order list'.. THIS steak was HUGE! It was on the menu for $26 and was piled with crab. I have had lesser filets in steak restaurants for way , WAY more than that price! Following dinner I ordered the cafe. I had no idea this was going to arrive in a larger than normal french press! $3.95 and you get a HUGE french press full of amazing Mexican cafe and pure cream..if you choose. Enough to share, trust me. We also just HAD to share the Churros Rellenos de Cajeta de Cabra. They are also pretty big! Shareable and filled with creamy, rich goat's milk and caramel; then served warm with vanilla ice cream , MORE warm caramel and candied pecans. The Flan de mi Miami. I mean, we had to order and share this too! Also topped with candied pecans and a little Kahlua and a generous portion, as well. Melt in your mouth amazing.  The facade of The Barrio Cafe is in itself so unique.. I spent at least ten extra minutes taking photos of the art. Inside there is more eclectic art, as well. As we left we felt lucky for getting to The Barrio Cafe about 615pm on a Friday night and not having to wait more than 15 minutes, because as we were leaving there was a HUGE wait outside and standing room only. I can see why this place was featured on Diners, Drive In's and Dives with Guy Fieri. I seriously just have to go back now and stick with the plan to taste what he highlighted on that show! <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foodnetwork.com%2Fvideos%2Fbarrio-cafes-cochinita-pibil-0206541.html&s=98e4db565a584a744d0a5c724c3561c1b9164fc78e70288cfa4afacef2cd1d0b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">foodnetwork.com/videos/b...</a> Barrio Cafe is a perfect place for the senses of taste, smell and to the artful eye!",

She communicated ingredients to us in such a friendly way to make sure we had no allergies.  It was a Sunday so the beer options were a little slim, Miranda had to break the news twice that my boyfriend's choice wasn't available. She was so professional that we didn't care. She could have told us again and we still wouldn't care!  We hope to see her soon at her regular location.  The food was spectacular too.  We especially like the touch of having our guac made fresh in front of us.  Until next time....",

    "text": "EXCELLENT!!  I've been wanting to try this place since I saw it on DDD.  It definitely met all of our expectations!  We came on Mothers Day after seeing the Frida exhibit at the Heard museum.  I thought the wait would be long, we were told it would be 20 minutes, but we only waited for less than 10.  Maybe because we were here at about 2:00 in the afternoon.  The art outside and all along this street was inspired by the chef to build a sense of community.  It's bright and ethnic, and beautiful!  We started with Barrio Guacamole - it was so different than any guac we've had before - I LOVED the pops of pomegranate!  My only disappointment was that it was wasn't served tableside as the menu had promised.  The bread and olive tapenade were a nice and different touch - we loved it!  My husband had the enchiladas suiza - spicy,juicy, delicious!  I had the chili's en nogada - the flavor combo's in this were out of this world!  I literally closed my eyes and was swept away to ancient  Puebla where this is from. The chili, and fruits (apricot, apples, pears) and nuts melded with the crema, the almonds, and the pomegranate and cilantro garnish.  WOW!!!  I couldn't stop eating the side of chipotle mashed potatoes and perfectly cooked calabasitas. Now that we're home I wish we had tried one of the deserts... I loved how the jicama came in a coke bottle, and the art on the walls inside.  Our service was excellent!  There was also a nice guitar player playing music to add to the ambiance. Very cool place, I hope I to have the opportunity to go again when in the Phoenix area!!  If you're anywhere near - GO!!",

    "text": "The food was amazing, and it deserves the recent attention it's getting as one of the best Mexican restaurants in the US.  The wait at lunch during the weekday was approximately 20 minutes, but once we were seated we got our orders in quickly.  For an appetizer, we ordered their queso fundido over their much talked about tableside guacamole, as it was something more unique and not typically found at every Mexican restaurant.  The dish was rich and creamy without being too greasy or heavy.  Highly recommended.  As our main course, we tried their cochinita pibil, pollo en mole, and pollo poblano, and while all these dishes were great (pollo poblano was buttery-melt-in-your-mouth great), the mashed papas and vegetable sides really stole the show at our table, and we wished we'd had gotten more.    The service, however, was less than ideal, as we had to wait a long time to get our waters refilled or for extra sauces. For the most part we felt very ignored and wished we didn't have to constantly try to get the staffs' attention.   Price-wise this place is on the expensive side with an average of around $20 per dish.  Their portions are not small, if that's any consolation, but it is a splurge to eat here.   Overall, great food, average to lackluster service, and a price that may not sit well with everyone's wallet. I would definitely return for special occasions or to show visitors a good, solid restaurant in the area.  (Side: the murals around their building are beautiful and are worth spending a few moments appreciating)",

    "text": "Last month, I went to Barrio Cafe while visiting Phoenix.  I was excited to see Chef Silva's take on Mexican cuisine.  Surprisingly, it ended up being one of the most frustrating and negative restaurant experiences I've had in a couple of years.  While I was genuinely amazed by how wonderful some of dishes were that night, my partner and I received extremely poor table service, experienced long delays waiting for our entrees, and received cold food that had to be replaced.    My partner and I arrived on a pretty busy evening.  After getting on the wait list, I ordered a cocktail at the bar.  The bartender forgot my order, and then forgot what type of drink I ordered.  Once that was sorted out, we waited in the outside patio area enjoying more drinks until our table was ready.  At that point in time, the rush was over and tables were slowly starting to clear.  After being seated, we ordered the shrimp quesadillas and queso fundido as appetizers.  For dinner entrees, we ordered the duck breast and mole chicken breast. Our two appetizers arrived promptly.  The shrimp quesadilla was amazing. I am not sure what I was expecting, but I loved it - the reduction sauce had a lot of strong, fresh flavors and the shrimp was of excellent quality.  The queso fundido was also delicious. It was spicy but not overpowering, and the taste and texture of the cheese and creme mix was amazing.  All the flavors blended really well.    Over half an hour later, we realized we had still not gotten our entrees.  By then, our section of the restaurant had almost cleared out and there was no sign of our server.  We overheard the people at the remaining table in our section complaining they had received the final bill, but had not been served some of the food they had ordered. More time passed, and we were about to get up and find someone (anyone) when a new server came into the room with our entrees.   On my first bite of the duck, I noticed the skin was dried out and rubbery, and it was not warm. My partner took a bite of his mole chicken breast and then said to me \"Is your food cold?\"  We confirmed that the sides were cold too.  The grilled zucchini was barely room temperature, and the polenta-based side was actually cold in the center, as if it had been refrigerated but not properly reheated.  At that point, my partner immediately got up and found the server in the other room.  All he said was \"our food is cold.\" The server didn't blink an eye, or act surprised. Rather, she rushed in and scooped up our plates while saying she'd get us replacements.  Although speculation, we wondered how long our food had been sitting out before the second server brought it to us, and if she had hoped we wouldn't notice anything wrong.    Eventually, our original server came back to our table and I think it was the first time we had our drinks refreshed since we had been seated.  We decided we were fine waiting for the new entrees and made polite chit-chat.  At that point, the restaurant was quiet, almost empty.  Silverware was being prepped, and linens were being placed on tables for the next day.    By the time our entrees arrived, over an hour had passed since we had ordered. Even though the original dishes came with polenta, it was now conspicuously missing from both plates.  We also noted there was a lot more zucchini.  The duck was fine, but nothing out of the ordinary.  The properly prepared mole sauce with my partner's dish, however, was really delicious. Spicy, and a lot of complex flavors that meshed together beautifully.  It went really well with the chicken, which had a smoked taste that complimented the sauce very well.  At that point, though, we just quietly finished our meals.    When finished, the original server said they'd like to comp our desserts if we were interested.   Nothing piqued our interest, but we ordered flan to share since one should never turn down a free dessert.  It tasted fine.  Overall, I see why people rave about the food, which made our experience there all the more frustrating.  While the entire staff was courteous, the service was completely substandard from the moment we were seated.  I strongly suspect they simply forgot about us and that our entrees sat out getting cold for quite some time before they realized their error.  They didn't try to correct it until we called them out.  They did not seem surprised when we did.  After all the delays and food problems, we got a comp'd a $10-ish dessert.  That's not experience you should get with a James Beard recognized restaurant and chef.  So that's why I gave it a one-star review.",

We were seated at a table and the waiter came to take our drink order after a little bit of a wait. We both ordered sangrias and we both loved the taste of them. They brought us a basket of bread with an olive tapenade that was quite tasty. We decided to start with the tableside guacamole that I had heard so much about. It was very good and the addition of the pomegranate seeds made it in my opinion. Hubby ordered the chicken enchiladas with mole sauce. It came with a side of calabasitas (zucchini and corn). To be honest he wasn't that impressed with it. The mole sauce was a bit too strong and tasted a little burnt. I had ordered the Chiles en Nogada which the waiter had recommended and it was divine. Unfortunately we did not save room for dessert however we did order two of their Horchatas to take with us. They were just as good as a dessert I could've easily have a drink another one. All in all we did enjoy our meal and will probably be back!",

Whatever it was, it was delicious.  The lady ordered a margarita, which was equally tasty (and strong!).   We started off with a spinach and cheese crepe, which lasted about five seconds. It was that good!  My lady ordered a seafood dish for me (fish, shrimp, little scallops) with grilled zucchini.  Topped with a creamy sauce and chorizo! AHHH! I didn't realize what it was until I bit in and immediately spit it out.  Sorry peeps, I just don't get down with the swine!  The rest of the dish, however, was magnificent!  Succulent little scallops, flaky fish morsels and juicy shrimp! I don't eat animal stuffs that often, but this was definitely worth the backslide.

Great back entrance to restaurant, even better Chicano Art, I would love to have bought a t-shirt but not in black, it's too hot here for black.  Will bring all my family and friends when they are visiting from out of town.  A Phoenix  hidden gem.",

Then 12.00 for guacamole? Just to cut and chop and mix salt,tomatoes,cilantro and lime? 12.00? No way no how, menu is expensive and over rated and very small portions. Would never go back.

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place. I arrived and stood in the entryway, and was ignored by multiple staff (the restaurant was not busy at the time) walking past me without eye contact or greeting. Eventually, someone came up and sat me. I think seating customers must not have been the other workers' jobs, but the lack of eye contact and greeting from multiple workers was bad form.  I ordered the Chile en Nogada, touted as a chile stuffed with chicken, apple, pears, dried apricot, pecans, and surrounded by an almond cream sauce, some cilantro, queso fresco, and pomegranate seeds. Sounds great, right? In reality, what I got was a seared pepper stuffed with dried-out mush. It was utterly disappointing. The chicken pieces and other filling was dried out, and did not have any dried apricots that I could discern. I did notice raisins. I also couldn't taste the apples or pears in the tasteless mush. The cream sauce was sickeningly sweet and did not combine well with the dried out mush that was stuffed inside the seared pepper. I could not finish even half of it. It was horrid.  A side plate that accompanied the Chile en Nogada / mush was potatoes, zucchini, and tomato. This tasted good, but in no way seemed congruous with the plate it accompanied. Very odd. But thankfully, something of the entree was edible.  My friend ordered carne asado tacos. These tasted good (she gave me one as my meal was so bad). The side salad that accompanied them had a delightfully piquant dressing, but was marred by some rotten leaves of lettuce.  The olive tapenade and bread were odd starters at a Mexican restaurant. The bread was nice, but the tapenade was thoroughly boring. I ate one piece and had no interest in eating more.  My friend, who had the better meal, said she thought overall, it was terrible, and she would not be back.   I don't see much reason to go back. I think the kitchen was careless. Maybe the chiles en nogada is good if carefully prepared. We were there for dinner on a Sunday, so maybe the better chefs were not in the kitchen.  It's doubtful that I will be back. If in the area, I will try nearby Santissima.   The cramped bathroom (unisex) could use some refurbishment. It is very small and on entering, one about runs into a urinal. All the fixtures were quite old.  I mentioned to the waiter that I was quite disappointed in my meal. He did not say anything. It wasn't worth it to me to pursue it. I was not impressed with his lack of initiative. He also did not check on us to inquire how are meals were until we were done (and at that point, he did not inquire, I informed him).  Not impressed.",

We drive by almost everyday and every time we saw this restaurant in the evening, it's packed with lots of people, no matter it's a weekday or weekend. We assumed this is a good place to eat so decided to give a try.  Well....I know we had a kind of high expectation about this restaurant but still, I only can give them 3 stars top.   Their service is good enough. I think their food is just average and over priced. The pork was dry and  way too salty and not tender at all. I felt a bit odd to have french fries with tacos and again, they were so salty. The shrimp tacos tasted okay but too much liquid inside, which I guess is water from shrimps, not from sauce.   If I ate lots of fast food Mexican food for a while, I would appreciate their food. I think they make effort to make their food \"look\" good or \"sound\" good but it's missing the x-factor to me and it's just average. There are other Mexican restaurants with better and/or more reasonably priced food.   Conclusion, I do not recommend this place and we would not go there again although this is the closest restaurant from our house. I don't say this restaurant is bad but it's not good either, just as 3 stars explain, \"A-OK\".",

However the interior is nice and cozy, but tightly spaced so I can imagine it being crowded and full. Service was a tad slow, and they served bread which was a bit of an odd choice, but the dip was good. The food itself was quite good. The Pollo Poblano was very flavorful and quite unique, we did see another table enjoy the Chiles En Nogada  as well.   There arent many veggie options though which is a bit of a bummer, the Chiles Con Queso sounds more interesting than it was in person as it was a tad too simplified. However the flavors were there and it was still a good meal. Overall, definitely worth a stop to taste something a bit different in Mexican cuisine with bold and strong flavors. Just wish the service was quicker and the overall balance of the meal was better and they had more veggie options.",

All that being said, I ordered the special of the night - an 8oz Fillet Mignon (with potatoes, chorizo, and all sorts of goodness) & 10oz Lobster tail.  The dish was absolutely divine and one of the best things I've ever eaten in CenPho.  My only gripe was the guacamole.  What a big disappointment.  All the hype- the freshness, the tableside, the blah blah blah, the $15 price tag.  You'd think this was ambrosiamole.  Not good at all.  One freakin avacado!?  That's all I get?

So I'll just say whenever people come from out of town, and they ask me where they can go for \"real\" Mexican food...this is where I send them.  Tex-Mex isn't Mexican.  Silvana's Chiles en Nogadas is.    I remember the first time I met Silvana, at the Botanical Garden, where she had a demo showing how many ingredients are put into a traditional mole sauce.  It's that kind of love for her food that transfers into her creations.    Yes, the lines can be long.  But there's an obvious reason for that.  Besides, the tequila selection is quite extensive.  Consider it part of the Barrio experience.  Order some chips and guac, enjoy the art, chat with the bartender, learn about the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FCalle16.org&s=139e406fcbbc6e880f165f10eff12df9fbf4555521a3a8a1d97b178bd4fb2afc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Calle16.org</a> project, take it all in.  BTW, I think many of the people who don't like this restaurant are so indoctrinated by Tex Mex they have a hard time considering a different, and authentic take, on what Mexican food really means.  The country has 32 different states, so many different regions and cultures...it's not just tacos and burritos.   If you're not willing to be open to that, if you don't have time for a great night out...and aren't willing to wait...there's always Taco Bell.  I'd appreciate you patronize them so you shorten my own wait at Barrio.",

The table-side prepared guacamole was surprisingly good with the added dried cranberries, but my chicken with black mole was only so-so. The mole sauce was really watery and kind of plain in flavor, which was disappointing because I heard that the mole was one of Barrio Cafe's strengths. The chicken itself was cooked well, though. Juicy and not dry. Maybe I caught Barrio Cafe on a bad mole night? Who knows.   I went back again for dinner some weeks later and had a pollo poblano dinner which, again, was alright, but for the price (almost $18) I wasn't remotely sure if it was worth it.   I'll go back again, because I really liked the place itself, but it definitely seems like it thrives more on the hype and atmosphere than the actual food.",

There are awesome murals in the back parking lot area - great for photo ops.  True Arizona, great quality.",

    "text": "I was looking to grab some tacos one night. I checked out Yelp and found that this place was in walking distance from my home and the reviews were great! Oh yeah, taco time!  For some reason I didn't check out the menu or attire before heading over there so I was a bit surprised when I walked in with my Vans on and a baseball cap.  Oops, my bad. Everyone was dressed in their nice evening wear and I looked like I was ready to hop on my bicycle and cruise around the block.  That being said, I was greeted and seated with a smile! I ordered a delicious margarita on the rocks and picked out one of the many tequilas on the shelf. Oh my! It's scary I live so close to a place that has my favorite drink.  The food, oh my, the FOOD! Class act.  When I said I was looking for tacos I wasn't expecting this place AT ALL. This is not your corner taco stand with sloppy beans and dry rice...this is gourmet Mexican food.   Even though I wanted tacos when the night started I had to splurge, because I was there. I ordered the The Pescado del Mar which included shrimp, lobster, halibut and scallops. Just a few of my favorite things. Being from New England I totally appreciated how the plate was cooked, if it wasn't cooked right you would hear it. The lobster and scallops were cooked perfectly and there was plenty of everything on there.  My friend ordered the Chile Relleno, she loved it.  Bottom line is this place is in an area you would expect to find some good cheap authentic tacos but what you get is some beautiful, delicious food and great ambiance. I would definitely recommend that you head on out to Barrio.",

So we all tried their sangria, OMG!!! Can I say wow? Sangria with red wine, fused with jack daniels and mango on the bottom! I loved it!!!During the wait, enjoyed the atmosphere of live music, artwork, and watching the delicious dishes come out. We got our table, and started out with their tableside made guacamole. More high marks!! This had pomegranite seeds mixed in, I was in heaven!1 So was my group! Our entrees arrived and I had a chicken-crab torta with avocado pico dressing and mole on the side. It was fabulous!! We were all very happy with our food, and they brought me a birthday flan! I felt very taken care of here with the service! I will definitely be back! Thank you Barrio!!",

But, the portions are small and really, really pricey. You get half as much as you would expect at twice the price. Not to mention they tout the chef and menu being inspired by her childhood in southern Mexico. So when I ordered my entree and the waitress asked me would I like fries or salad with it, needless to say I was more than a bit surprised. What? Did she grow up in Mexico having fries with her tacos?  The place is tiny and incredibly noisy. You don't have a conversation there, you have a shouting match. And it is full of forty and fifty-something urban and hip upper middle class. (Although, is there a middle class anymore?) Not that there is anything wrong with that, I think it just speaks to the the food, prices and atmosphere.There is barely enough room to navigate and the near misses between the staff and the customers are something to see. Again, the place is not bad. I would probably like it a lot more if it were a lot less expensive. But, I think the Barrio Cafe is more hype than anything else and I don't think they deliver.",

    "text": "My co-workers and I checked out Barrio Cafe on a whim.  We almost drove right by it the first time, as it is nestled in a row of shops on 16th Street just before Thomas. There is a very very small parking lot in the back, but parking is also available on the residential street.  The restaurant looks like a hole in the wall on the outside, but inside the door is simple but very nice.  And the alcohol display when you first walk in is quite impressive!  The menu is quite large and incredibly diverse. It is not typical Mexican...I would describe it as Mexican with a flair.  I had the chicken \"torta\" with crab and cheese, which you can get with either a side salad or seasoned fries...I got the fries.  The chicken, cheese and crab combination was very tasty and incredibly filling. I was only able to eat about half of it and some of my fries before getting full.  The chicken was cooked to perfection and the cheese and crab complimented each other very well and neither overpowered the taste of the chicken.  Service, at lunch, was very fast, although our service was a little underwhelming.  UPDATE-January 2008  I met a group of girlfriends for dinner on a Thursday night at Barrio.  The bar area is too small to adequately hold the number of people waiting on a busy night...I felt smushed like a sardine and it was almost impossible to get to the bar to order a drink while we waited.  Plus, we had an hour wait.  Luckily, our waitress was very nice once we got seated and was more than accommodating when we paid to run seven credit cards.  I tried the garlic and tequila lobster quesadilla...I did not like it at all.  First, I don't like open faced quesadillas...second, not enough cheese for my liking.  Third, the lobster was very blah and didn't taste like it was cooked properly.  Finally, there was live music that night.  We happened to be sitting pretty close to where the musicians were set up, which made conversation almost impossible.  I'm not sure live music in such a small establishment is really a good idea.  I would definitely recommend Barrio as a lunch location, but not for dinner.",

    "text": "Central Phoenix. CenPho. Cennypoo. What am I going to do with you? Every time I think I can't possibly fall any harder for you, you surprise me with something new and unexpected that blows my mind. No, you don't have the stereotypically sexy look at first glance that Manhattan or San Francisco or Chicago do. To be honest I can barely remember our first date, which I think was when I stopped at Majerles in '98 before walking on to Bank One Ballpark to watch the fledgling Dbacks. Admit it, you weren't even trying to impress me back then, were you? I walked you back to my car hoping for a lil' somethin' after the game, but you barely even looked at me and I had nowhere to go. So back home I went, to that hot sexy young thing I was with at the time. What was her name? Oh yeah. Tempe. Wow. She was something. Back in the day, all the other cities would see me with her and glare with envy at how good she looked strutting her stuff on Mill Ave on a Friday night.   Slowly but surely, you began to wage your subtle campaign of charm on me. Even a jaded guy like me began to notice all the little things that really matter in life. I woke up one morning and there you were with a tray in hand and, on it, Matt's Big Breakfast. I'll never forget that other time when you tricked me into wandering up Central Ave and \"accidentally\" stumbling across Lux. Need I go on? It seems like every other time I'm with you, I make a new discovery. The more I get to know you, the more tiny bursts of elegance and grace and uniqueness shower my senses. No, not all of them are on one street tightly bunched together like those snooty runway models New York or San Francisco, which are so uppity that I'd have to be a multimillionaire to even have a chance to really enjoy them anyway, much less afford property. No, you make me dig a little deeper, look a little closer, and do a little exploring before I'm rewarded with your precious gems. A good seductress knows how to maintain an aura of mystery about her. And you, darling, are good.   So here I am, already having developed a pretty huge crush on you. And then you up the ante by another notch. Cafe Barrio. Barely visible, in a nondescript strip mall by 16th Street and Thomas. On a Wednesday night I walked past a crackhead through the run-down parking lot to enter through a backdoor, my suspicious mom in tow. And once again, you blow me away. The place is packed. I hear laughter, engaged conversation, people with grins on their faces, people on dates, another dude also with his mom (who actually smiled knowingly at my mom as we walked by). An entire world of urban happiness that's invisible to the commuters whizzing by outside on 16th street. What is this food? It's not traditional Sonoran, that's for sure. Ohhhh, I see: it's \"modern Mexican with a heavy French influence,\" as your waitress put it. Sure. Find two of the kinds of cuisine I love most, and somehow find a way to combine them in one, all in an unpretentious setting 6 minutes away from my house. Damn, woman, you are good.   I don't say this lightly. When you came out with a tray, cut open that avocado, and mixed up various fresh ingredients in front of our very eyes to make the tastiest guacamole me or my mom have ever tasted in our life, I knew the moment had arrived. I'm ready to take the plunge. I'm ready to say that I don't want to ever live anywhere else, because there is no way I could get to know someone as intimately, as closely, as sweetly as I do you. Yeah yeah, there are other fish in the sea. I know that. But you're my fish, Cennypoo.",

    "text": "We found this place completely by chance on a rainy Sunday. Situated in a Strip of shops on 16th Street just south of Thomas, the neighborhood itself can make some want to put pedal to the metal and zoom straight through. But I am kind of the opposite. I love a few little places I have found around here including a little Mexican Snack/Ice Cream Shop just a few blocks south of Barrio. Any way back to Barrio. I really didn't know what to expect not having heard of it but the fresh paint and more modern exterior relative to the neighbors we thought, why not. WOW! We walk in to be surprised by a super busy Sunday Brunch crowd. With perfect timing we were seated within 10 minutes. The guitarist performing was superb, with a wonderful mix of spanish classical and modern favorites.  It was busy and rather crowded and our table rocked on the saltio tile floors. They offer varying menu but on this day we decided on the Sunday Brunch Menu. Several items ranging between $8-$14. I decided for the Calabasas dish and my friend, who couldn't decide between the huevos rancheros and the chorizo con huevos, on the suggestion of the server got the huevos with a side of chorizo. I ordered the horchata and he had the coffee.  The meal started with a complimentary basket of crusty french style bread with a mild yet flavor packed red pepper tapanade (a medley of olives, garlic and capers). Followed by our drinks. The coffee, served in a metal press, was very aromatic. My horchata, served in a glass Coca Cola bottle, was very sweet and more highly milk based and not as rice-y as I tend to like. It almost reminded me of egg nog with out the extent of the spices. While good, it was not what I was expecting.  The plates arrived. My friend raved about his huevos rancheros and said the chorizo was some of the best he has had, I had to agree it was fresh and not greasy. My plato de calabacitas was covered in cheese and the eggs hiding under that layer of cheese and squash. The calabacitas alone could have used some more salt but when combined with the tomato pico de gallo at the edge of the plate, perfect. The home fries were nicely prepared and flavorful. We left stuffed with no room for desert.  I will be back to enjoy yet another quality food find.",

Upon arriving at eleven for lunch, they tried to sit us in the very back, next to the bathroom, even though the place was empty.  The house margaritas were okay, but not even close to the ones from Sam's Cafe.  The chipotle chicken dip was a mess of cheese and slimy chicken, slimy spinach, and slimy mushrooms.  You sense a theme?  The smokey, sweet flavor was good for a bite or two, but it quickly became an unappetizing mess.  My husband's pork was supposed to be the special of the restaurant, but it was nothing special, and some of it was unbearably dry.  My enchiladas del mar were smothered with a horrendous quantity of cheese, and I had no idea how I was supposed to eat them, as there seemed to be mere scraps of blue tortilla amid the massive amounts of sauce and cheese.  The shrimp were decent sized, but undercooked (understandable since the tiny scallops and crab would cook a lot faster).  The churros were the highlight, but they couldn't save the meal.  Lunch ran over $100, plus cab fare.  I would rather have given the money to one of the homeless people by the Hyatt Regency.    Another chef told me that the head chef of Barrio Cafe has left, so maybe that explains the divergent reviews.  All I know is that I would never go back to this restaurant.",

    "text": "Barrio has issues, but the fare is unusually satisfying. Masterful even. Sure, it's busy and loud, a little too expensive, they dont take rezzies and the parking's cramped, but this is the kind of inventive, non-formulaic food  that makes dining out memorable, even joyful, and the other stuff worth enduring.    Tacos look small and naked on the plate, unflanked by rice or beans, but are delicate, yielding and delicious - overstuffed with marvelous fresh ingredients; not the \"fresh\" touted by Taco Bell, but dreamy cheese, flaky halibut, exquisite slow roasted pork, fresh avocado wedge, secret sauce,etc.  Messy, surprisingly filling and an absolutely first class oral shindig, completely divorced from \"tacos\" elsewhere, and well worth the 12 or 15 dollars or whatever it is they charge. I like the fish tacos at Cheesecake Factory (which are bigger), but Barrio's are gastronomically in a different league.   Soups are flavorful and textured.  My companions rave about the mole and the duck.  The pork torta is amazing.  To call the warm churros with ice cream a \"treat\" is a criminal understatement.  If you're on a budget, take your date just for the churros. Later, you will have sex.  It may not trump dessert, but you will have sex.  ( If for some reason, you dont, leave that person at once. You will never please them. )   Not everything on the menu elicits quite that euphoria, but there are half a dozen items that flip my feral bioswitch from \"eat\" to \"devour\", like a wolf over fresh kill.   It's like a click in my head, and this Silvana Salcido Esparza Comida de los Dioses, or whoever she is, deftly holds the switch.    I'll forego comment on the bar because, surprisingly, I dont drink.",

    "text": "Completely deserving of the great reviews this place consistently garners.  I met a couple of friends here not long ago. I had heard many great things about Barrio , but had never made it in. Obviously I had only seen pictures because I had no idea what it looked like on the outside. Being somewhat unfamiliar with the area, I accidentally passed it three times. After my third U-turn, I finally spotted it.  Limited parking turns out to be in the rear. Same place where the pain was at trying to find this place for the first time.  The interior is very interesting. There is alot of Dios De La Mujer going on which is very colorful images of dancing skeletons etc.  The place was packed, although I was told that they were having a somewhat slower than normal evening. I sat in the front with my friends who were halfway through their cervezas. I was so hungry by this time I barely greeted them and started instead to greet the delicious ships and varied salsa in between us. Our server was there immediately with an offer for my beverage selection. Yes, I replied.  We began with one of the specialties: The Guacamole Casero which was prepared table side using obviously the freshest of ingredients. The server explained that, when in season, fresh pomegranate is added for texture and sweetness. Today however, dried cranberries were used. Wonderful addition to the classic recipe.  One of my friends ordered the Pato en Tamarindo (Seared Duck) and was very pleased. I forgot what the other friend ordered. Did I mention Cervezas? I chose the highly recommended Cochinita Pibil (12 hour slow roasted pork with achiote rojo & sour orange). It was incredible. I asked to sample the mole and found it's smokey dark chocolate flavor also complimented the meal.  It turns out that the manager is an old friend of mine and we caught up on more than 20 years. For a list of who's moved, died or whatever, just ask the manager. He sent over a trio of high end tequila shots for us to sample along with another house favorite: freshly baked Churro with warm, sweet caramel resting on a mound of creamy vanilla bean ice cream. It was the perfect finish for a great dinner!  Service, ambiance, and the food deserve 5 stars all around. Getting there for the first time- uh, not so much-but worth it in every way!",

I've gone in several times before every writing this review and can honestly say I've never experienced Mexican food with this much flair and taste (even moms cooking is going to take a back seat). I've taken friends here and they rave about it. I've referred many friends and they rave about it.   I've been to Frontera Grill in Chicago, which is owned by Rick Bayless, noted chef and author.  While it was good, Barrio Cafe is a cut above.    The pollo poblano is absolutely delicious, as are the enchiladas suizas.  I can't wait to go back again and try something else on the menu.   There is almost always a wait but it's definitely worth it.",

Peg and I made our first trip to this place last week.  As is always the case with places that we love and visit again and again, there needs to be extraordinary everything. In this case, Marcos provided excellent service and the man (sadly, I do not know his name...yet)  who was taking care of busing tables, keeping beverages filled was incredible. In the midst of the whirlwind of activity, he was smiling and very efficient. The guacamole is legendary and will good reason. Pomegranate seeds in the midst of fresh ingredients and perfect avocados are genius.  The pollo poblano was a wonderful starter. The complementary dishes were tacos.....one featuring succulent pulled pork and the other, halibut..and they were simply amazing. When a familiar face is present, it makes the experience even more special. Julio Mata is one of the more accomplished chefs around and his skills elevate the whole playing field. We are delighted to include this place as one of our best ever places to relax and enjoy!  Dr. B",

    "text": "I've dined at Barrio Cafe three times. I have mixed feelings. I really want to love Barrio because I love the concept...fresh, original, Mexican-American-inspired food by an award-winning chef in a non-snooty neighborhood.   The most memorable dish I had was the chicken mole. You get a generous portion. The sauce is a good balance of sweet, spicy, and smokey. The chicken was cooked well, but not very tender. The margarita drinks I had were delicious. The table side guacamole was so-so. Overall, I found the prices to be too high compared to the food and service experiences I've had. It's solid but not stellar.  What bothers me most about Barrio is their execution of the concept. The graffiti-style artwork on the exterior walls is beautiful and shines with Mexican-American cultural pride, but once I walked through the door, I felt like I was in Scottsdale. Once when I was dining at the bar, I overheard a couple of waiters gossip with the bartender and mock a customer who had asked for rice and beans in the dining area. Okay, we get it Barrio, you're hood-hip and gourmet and all, but don't be petty...is it that unreasonable to expect rice and beans on a Mexican restaurant menu?  Perhaps the staff is coached to take on an air of superiority, to beat-down assumptions that the \"gringos\" might have about dining in a Mexican food joint. Whatever it is, it's my impression that the show they put on is hampering the quality of the food and service in some cases. The food and service should stand on its own...no amount of attitude can make up for that.",

After reviewing the place before our travel we were so excited and Dreaming about trying this supposed to be amazing Mexican flavors in Arizona.  When we arrived we were positively amazed by the art and paintings of the building. We couldn't wait for the food!  The server kind of cocky, not what I'm used from my Mexican brothers and sisters, brought a menu with interesting prices.  I found them high but then I thought....  It might be that good on flavors and portions. ... Let's wait.  To our big disappointment the food was flavorless, specially the pork they announce so much. My thoughts?  How bad could you be in the kitchen to make a flavorless pork?!!!  No salad in the tacos,  no sauce, no sign of real Mexican delicious flavors and shameful portions that would not be enough not even as an appetizer.  But the worst thing ever,  when we asked for salsa picante or hot sauce...  The server said they did not have any homemade!!!!!  And brought us a bottled salsa...  And a cheap one!

    "text": "A fantastic Mexican inspired restaurant that will take you beyond taco's and enchiladas.  The drinks are fun and interesting including the Flor De Jamaica Margarita**** (Hibiscus flower reduction, Tesoro Silver Tequilla and Grand Mariner).   We started with the Kuali de Camaron and an appitizer of the Pork Taco's.  The Kuali de Cararon***** was an amazing five star appetizer which had layers of flavor.  The roasted jalapeno filled with queso de cabra y oaxaca was spicy and creamy.  The shrimp and avocado gave the dish that extra level of flavor and texture although I would have eaten just the cheese and cream filled jalapeno as is.  I ordered the pork tacos*** because I wanted to try the pork which is marinated in the achiote and sour orange and cooked in a banana leaf overnight.  I have tried this marinade myself and wanted to see if I got it right.  The pork was wonderful however I thought it was missing something like an avocado slice or a creamy cheese to balance it out.'  For my main course I enjoyed Chef Silvana's Iconic Dish, Chiles en Nogada*****.  This is a fire roasted poblano pepper filled with chopped chicken, apple, pear, dried apricot and pecans, in a delicate almond cream sauce.  Cilantro and pomegranate seeds complete the Mexican flag colors for final presentation.  This dish was different and very tasty.  I think the almond cream sauce and queso fresco is what made the dish for me.  My wife had the Pescado del Mar***.  The fish of the day was halibut however she didn't get to try most of it because she was full from the bounty of shrimp, scallops and sweet crab meat which it was covered in.  The halibut was a little dry as well.  The cream sauce and crab meat really store the show for this dish.  We didn't have space for desert.  Great decor here as well.",

If you're looking for quantity, you'll be disappointed.  At BC you'll be paying for creativity and quality. We totally dig it!   We all chose different choice of meat tacos and I tell you,  all five of us were super content.  (My steak tacos were perfectly cooked and tender). I don't like olives but as an appetizer they serve sourdough bread with an olive spread. My party thought it was delicious.   Not to mention the ambiance....super hip. They had a man playing solo on his guitar Gypsy Kings type music. That was super cool. Everyone was friendly and helpful.   P.S. Don't forget to read the history of the Cafe and Chef herself.

    "text": "Good service, a nice friendly/unique atmosphere, and excellent food, what more could one ask for from a Sunday afternoon brunch??? Not much. This past weekend, the family and I made the trek to downtown Phoenix to try Barrio Cafe and I'm sure glad we did. We arrived promptly when they opened to avoid the crowds, and even though we were so early, the service and food surely hit the mark. It took us a minute or two to actually find the place, but once we did, it's actually hard to miss. Loved the decor and wall art, couldn't have gone better with the food.  As for the food and drinks, everything was delish. We shared the \"famous\" guacamole, which was simple, fresh, and as everyone else on Yelp can attest to, very tasty. For lunch I had the pork tacos... the pork they are known for. It was simple as well, but everything was good... not amazing, but on point. For dessert we all shared the tres leches, which blew me away (though I only got a couple bites).   This small hole in the wall place is serving up some unique, fresh, yummy food and drinks (BTW had a margarita and it was also very good), so you can bet we will venture to downtown again and pop into this spot.",

    "text": "BEST chips and tableside guac ever. Huge tequila selection. This is not your typical Mexican; Chef Silvana is a James Beard nominated chef and a visionary. I've enjoyed blue corn lobster enchiladas before, and they have fantastic mole!! Super cool art all around, cool bathrooms with beautiful crosses and Mexican colors. Live music sometimes, and the service has always been great for me. Celebrated my birthday there with 12 people, so despite the quaint & cozy size of the restaurant, it is possible to have a large party as long as you give them ample notice. **Note: you can not park in front of the restaurant; you must park behind (VERY FEW spaces) or on a side street. So the parking sucks, but this place is SO worth it!!! Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "I found this place via google, and was very intrigued with the best Mexican awards.  I love the funky vibe with the street art and local artists featured inside.  The food is solid, but not knocking my socks off.  I imagine to be decorated that there would be multidimensional flavors and textures where every dish is presented well.    The evening started with the bread and olive tempande.  I like this spin that makes the restaurant unique.    We then ordered the table side guac.  Definitely fresh and delicious guac, but nothing that is so spectacular that I was amazed.  I did like the touch of pomegranate arils which provide a nice crunchy and juicy texture.    My friend had a house margarita which was pretty standard.  I had the chata beverage which is horchata mixed with tequila and kahlua.  It was tasty, but I didn't really feel any effects of the alcohol despite drinking it before eating.    For the main course, I ordered the filetito torta which was delicious and tender.  I got the salad on the side which was probably a mistake when the other option was fries.  It was just mixed green with balsamic vinegar based dressing with some white cheese and some chopped up peppers.  I enjoyed the torta, however.  I can't speak to my companion's fish tacos as I didn't try them, but it looked good but small.    The best part of the meal which actually lived up to the hype was the caramel churro dessert.  It was goat's milk caramel stuffed churro with more caramel on top with pecans and ice cream.  Very good.    This is a good Mexican restaurant, but the hype around it just builds you up to be disappointed.  It's also rather pricey for what you are getting and for the lack luster presentation/reputation/flavors.",

The food was great, starting with the table side guacamole (do it!). It was really tasty for me, though some people at my table weren't into the while pomegranate seeds. I get it.  My entree was amazing, I had the Chiles en Nogada. Almost anything with that much cream and butter will be amazing, but I savored every last bite and wished for more.  The atmosphere was so-so. Unfortunately they had a band playing that was too loud for the small space, and this on top of a packed restaurant with several guests waiting caused us to be unable to hear each other speak. Hopefully they will keep the live music to less busy nights in the future.",

This was shortly lived because as I was sat in my table I noticed not a single Hispanic was in the restaurant. My thought was, ooooh boy here we go again another so called authentic Mexican restaurant with Americanized food. But let me tell you, I was greatly surprised. So this is what my meal consisted of. We ordered Agua de Limon, Enchilada Suezas and Chile En Ahogada. The Agua de Limon tasted amazing and unlike other places that say that their lemonade is fresh when it really is not it was not bitter/sour. It had the perfect mixture of ice,lemon and sugar. The Enchiladas Suezas were another amazing dish. The white sauce, complemented with the bacon and grilled chicken was perfect and would recommend. Last but definitely not the least was the Chile en Ahogada. OMFG, I literally got a foodgasm. If you are in this restaurant you cannot leave without eating a Chile En Ahogada. It's probably top 10 in my list of the best foods I have tried in my life. I hope my comments assist anything in making a decision where to eat. Best of luck to everyone and I hope my comments here assist you a bit I'm taking a decision.",

I have been making guacamole at home for years with pomegranate seeds, as I loved the previous owner of the barrio restaurants and think she is amazing. I don't like paying for overpriced food, however. The duck I ordered was quite good, and my friend enjoyed her tacos, but both dishes were amazingly overpriced. I don't care if I get a white tablecloth. I also don't care for extremely loud fellow restauranteurs, whom make it difficult for me to talk to my friend. They may have been 15 feet away, which would make one assume I could hear my friend, but that was not the case.  They were also clearly friends with the staff. The food is good, but I won't be back until they knock off the extra price for the white tablecloths which honestly make me feel uncomfortable and until the staff pays attention to actual patrons instead of friends or family. I did not enjoy my time here or feel that I got my money's worth at all. I felt cheated. Chef Asparza knew what she was doing when she was around. I'm not so sure that the current owners or chefs do, though.  The Barrio restaurants are not what they once were. My name is Stirling Peters.",

You wouldn't think that everything in that dish would work together, but the layers of flavors was like a party in my mouth! The waiter was fun, service was good. The dessert was not as good as the main dishes which is why I did not give a full five stars. We ordered the churro filled with cajeta. Somehow we don't think it was all prepared at the restaurant. If they ever make the churros from scratch it will be a winner. Definitely worth visiting if ever on the Phoenix area.",

The prices match the quality of the food. That being said it is pricier for lunch. We spent $40 for two of us for lunch and did not have sodas or dessert.  In the not as great side of the table, I was looking for standard chips and salsa but they do not provide that like most Mexican restaurants.  Instead the offer bread and olives.

Entrees were the pipian verde and fish taco platters.  I adored the presentation.  The plates looked appetizing (quite the opposite of platters at other mexican restaurants where refried beans, cheese, and sauce are spilled all over like vomit and diar...you get the picture).    Not so sure why everyone is raving about the guacamole.  The extra ingredients just made it too crunchy and overly tangy.  Yuck!  Not worth the price.",

Tacos - slow roasted Mayan pork - were crazy delicious.  The serving was 4, with double corn tortillas, so I divided them and made 8 tacos - holy mackerel, they were good!  My wife won the Mexican food lottery, however: Chile Relleno Nogales or something like that.  It was sweet and spicy; a chile stuffed with cheese, fruit, nuts, and lightly layered in a sweet, nutty sauce.  Literally the best Mexican dish I've ever tasted (including in Mexico itself).  It combined the best of savory and sweet.  We didn't leave a single morsel on the plate.  Amazing.  Tip:  order a simple margarita (off the menu), with tequila, lime and agave nectar.  So simple, yet so tasty.",

In any case, I we lucked out and hit the Barrio on a Friday morning around 11.  It was busy, but no problems landing a table.  I grabbed a peach margarita and would have to say it was not only worth the $7, it would have been worth $17.  For lunch, the carne asada and pork tacos were both outstanding.  Also a nice surprise was the fries with super tangy chipotle sauce.    A little busy, a little pricey, but I don't think you'll mind either once you get a taste of the menu here.",

    "text": "I was expecting my Sunday lunch at Barrio Cafe to be one thing but got another. They are recognized by the Phoenix Magazine, January 09 Dining Guide issue, for their tableside guacamole.   I was expecting tableside guacamole but they don't offer it during lunch. Which, I'm not sure if they did it would change my opinion. What made it unique (not necessarily good) was the addition of the slightly sweet pop of pomegranates seeds. But still, pomegranate seeds or not, I can't justify paying $10 for any guacamole.  What I liked most about Barrio was the service, the live acoustic guitar, and their Chiles en Nogada. Their Chiles en Nogada dish; roasted poblano pepper; stuffed with perfectly seasoned chicken; onion; garlic; pecans; apples; pears; apricots and pomegranates, finished with a creamy slightly sweet almond sauce - was spot on and truly a great surprise.   Overall, I had a really good meal (expensive for Sunday lunch) that surprised me and intrigues me to try other entrees. Their dishes incorporate seasonal produce with, what seems to be, authentic Mexican cuisine. Hopefully there will be more surprises for me when I go back.",

    "text": "On my last day in Phoenix, I found this treasure.  I'd been disappointed all week by Mexican food no better (and in some cases, much worse - see Los Sombreros!) than I can get at home in Boston.  I'm usually skeptical of places that win \"Best of\" awards from magazines with city names because I know how easily those \"judges\" can be swayed.  I'm happy to report that in this case, the judges are right and the long string of  \"Best Mexican Restaurant\" awards that Barrio Cafe has won from Phoenix Magazine is well deserved.   My friends didn't want to meet for brunch, but I really wanted to try this place so I headed out by myself on Sunday at 11:30.  The restaurant is small, and my preferred solo seating - the bar - wasn't available (it only has 2 seats, anyway) because it was being stocked by the bartender and isn't usually open for brunch.  I was seated at a table for 2 and was impressed the genuine feel of the surroundings and the genuine attentiveness of my waiter.  The walls are filled with artwork by local artists, all of which is for sale.  The restaurant is very small and the tables are close together, so if you have a large group, you'll feel a bit confined, but it's well worth it.    I started with a la Picocita margarita and some guacamole.  The marg was awesome - it's Chinaco silver tequila infused with chile de arbol pepper, the glass is dusted with chile powder and the drink is served with a pepper and a lime.  Not the traditional margarita taste, but it was fantastic - the right margarita for brunch the way a Bloody Mary often works as a brunch drink.    The guacamole was among the best I've ever had.  I am a guac fiend, and this was just fantastic.  I didn't expect the sprinkling of pomegranate seeds, but they really added to it.  The chips were fresh & firm enough to manage a good dipping without breakage.  Although it's supposed to serve 2, I ate the entire dish & could have licked the bowl.    For an entree, I went off of the brunch menu because the brunch offerings were pretty mainstream.  Unlike many other restaurants, while Barrio has a brunch menu, you're not limited to it.  The entire menu is available.  I selected the Chiles en Nogada - a roasted poblano pepper stuffed with chicken, onions, garlic, pecans, apples, pears and apricots and finished with an almond sauce and pomegranates.  It's only available when pomegranates are in season because the chef feels they add so much to the dish.  The chef is right, and the dish was absolutely out of this world both visually and gastronomically.   There is a lot going on with this dish, but the flavors combined beautifully and the pepper was perfectly roasted.    I shouldn't have, but I was so impressed at this point that I moved on to dessert and coffee (I didn't eat again until almost 9:00).  For dessert I chose the Churros, a fairly common dish, but I'd never had them before stuffed with goats milk caramel and served with vanilla bean ice cream.  What a treat!  And the coffee?  I like my coffee black and rich.  Theirs was so good that I bought a bag of beans to bring home to Boston with me.   So what wasn't perfect?  Well, at brunch, they have live music.  The guitarist was excellent, but DOES NOT NEED TO BE AMPLIFIED in a room that small.  And there is the fact that the room is very small.  At a 2-top against the wall, I was protected from the distractions that diners at a central table will experience.  If it were possible to award 4 1/2 stars, I would do so for those two reasons, but it isn't, and with Barrio Cafe's food, there is no way I'm cutting it down to only 4 stars.   Thank you, Barrio Cafe, for proving to me that it is worth going to the southwest to get excellent southwestern and Mexican cuisine.  Until brunch on Sunday, I was grotesquely underwhelmed with what Phoenix & Scottsdale had to offer on that front.",

    "text": "My friends Heather and Joe and I decided to meet up for dinner on a Wednesday evening, and Heather picked Barrio Cafe. I'd never been there before, and everyone is always telling me how good the food is, so I was quite excited.   Before I even arrived, Heather sent me a text message that I can paraphrase with: The chairs are so uncomfortable, I think I'm going to cry.   I called her and told her we should go somewhere else if she was so uncomfortable (oh, I should mention that Heather is pregnant ... with twins). Just then, Joe walked in and saved the day (dun-dun-da-da!) with a plush towel he happened to have in his car. Ahh ... Heather's tush was now at ease.   When I arrived, Joe and Heather had already decided to get the Queso Fundido: Roasted poblanos, sauteed spinach, mushrooms and melted Oaxacan cheese with queso fresco & chorizo. It was served with chips and bread, and it was delicious.   Joe and I also ordered la Sangria, which is their Sangria made with red wine, mango puree & Jack Daniels. This was also quite yummy - I'd love to try to recreate it at home.  Both Joe and Heather got the Enchiladas de Mole, which the waiter actually hesitated on and warned them that not everyone likes it. Heather and Joe were perplexed ... They like mole ... Apparently some people who like mole don't like the mole at Barrio Cafe ... Flashforward to the end of the meal: Neither Joe or Heather really thought the mole was that great.  I tried something completely different and got the Enchiladas de Hongos, sauteed wild mushroom melange with queso de cabra and aciete de trufa blanca. They pretty much had me at goat cheese (oops, I mean queso de cabra). Complimenting the dish were roasted vegetables that were so sweet .... Mmmm .... the cheese was light and fluffy, and the white corn tortillas were so soft that the enchiladas tasted like a Mexican version of cheese blintzes.   I stopped myself from over-eating (although, it was so good, it took some major effort), and now I have leftovers to enjoy for lunch tomorrow. Yum!",

It was featured in an article in the Southwest airlines magazine; had a big ad in the hotel's guide to services; and is one of the few places on Yelp with more than a handful of reviews.  Seating was prompt and friendly. The art on the wall, though vibrant and aggressive, didn't distract. Our server resembled a very happy and enthusiastic Mr. Clean, bald, always smiling and nodding.  The lemonade tasted real. The tableside gauc was really good even though I'm usually not a fan of so much tomato. The pomagranite seeds really work. The REAL fried tortilla chips really make the dish. My only compliant is the quantity/price ratio. $8 for one avocado's worth of guac. If my buddy were into it at all we would've been fighting over it. I heard the table next to us order a second shot of the stuff.  My spinach salad was nothing special.  No place to walk afterward. The price to pay for easy parking.",

I prefer the slow roasted pulled pork tacos but they are all good.  For me the downside is the environment it gets loud.  The tables are close and nothing absorbs the sound in the dining rooms.  I wouldn't recommend going for a serious meeting due to privacy and noise if busy.",

    "text": "My family stopped in here today for a late lunch (early dinner) after a fun day out at the Science Center. It has been at least a couple years since my husband and I had eaten at the Barrio Cafe, and this was my toddler's first time. She's a HUGE fan of guacamole, so we were really looking forward to the table side preparation but unfortunately it's only done at dinner time. Ok, minor disappointment, but not a big deal. What was disappointing was the guacamole itself. (Wish I hadn't forgotten my phone at home or thought to ask for my husband's so I could have taken a photo!)  For $11.25, you would think you would at least get the equivalent of one decent sized avocado, but that didn't happen. Nor did we even get what could be passed off as guacamole. It looked as though what avocado was there was was cut up, tossed into the bowl along with the other ingredients, topped with their signature pomegranate seeds and brought to the table! Don't get me wrong, I love a chunky guacamole but there wasn't one mashed piece of avocado in the bowl until we mixed it up ourselves. Then the first bite from my daughter elicited a \"NO!\" response, usually reserved for something like bell peppers or brussel sprouts. I tried a bite and could not believe how much lime was in it! Overkill would be a kind adjective.    For my meal I ordered the Tacos Pescado ($12.75) with a salad. The salad would have been a good simple one but unfortunately was overpowered by the amount of dressing on it and had mushy chopped tomatoes. There were three small (approx. 4\" white corn tortillas) tacos that were overflowing with cabbage. Each taco had 1 small piece of fish on them, that were cooked perfectly. Fish was tender and the beer batter was flavorful and crispy. Well... Crispy where it hadn't been drenched in what was only supposed to be a drizzle of Baja aioli. Unfortunately there was almost as much batter as there was fish! My daughter picked at a taco, chose to eat the fish, one of the tortillas and left the rest. The aioli had a bit of a bite to it but it tasted too much of mayonnaise to be considered good. I do have to say the tacos are filling with the double layer of tortillas. Completely overpriced for what I received.   My husband ordered the Tacos Cochinita ($12) with spicy fries. He didn't find it at all spectacular. It was good but not nearly as flavorful or enjoyable as in the past. Strange thing was the dish was accompanied by a side of BBQ sauce of all things! The fries had a slight bite to them but were over salted. The portion of meat on this was huge in comparison to what I received. Pricing and portion on this meal was closer to being on par with other specialty restaurants.  Our waiter, Hugo, was awful! The restaurant was not very busy (over half the tables empty). I assumed it was because of the odd hour we dropped in but even so, service by Hugo was lacking. My husband sat with an empty glass as Hugo walked by our table several times, empty handed half the time. My husband finally had to just stop him and ask for a refill. As I said before, the guacamole wasn't guacamole, and from what I understand the server is the one to mix this? And if not, isn't he at least supposed to make sure the item ordered is what he is serving? He never came by to check on us to see how our meal was so we opted to skip our other favorite here, dessert and their fresh pressed coffee. The bus person was super attentive, refilled waters when glasses weren't empty, cleared plates as soon as we were finished, impressive. Wish we could have tipped him instead of our waiter!  Also, as a side note for those of you with young children... they do have high chairs but no changing table and the bathroom was filthy. Floor was sticky, I don't even want to know with what and the garbage was overflowing. Kids meals were all $7 even just for a plain cheese quesadilla.   Had this been our first visit we would not have been impressed, but not nearly as disappointed as we were. Because we had had such great experiences previously this last visit was such a let down. Food just wasn't as good as it had been, service was nonexistent in comparison, prices went up and portions went down.   We hadn't been in the area much after having moved, but after having signed up for a membership at the Science Center we were hoping this restaurant would have become a weekly thing for us. Guess we'll keep searching.",

I've eaten dinner here a few times, which i will leave another review the next time i go. for now i think the brunch deserves 5 stars.",

The food is amazing and the atmosphere is so quaint and cute. My husband loves Mexican food, but was a little upset when they put pomegranate seeds in the guacamole.

When we pulled up around back (in the parking lot) we were welcomed with a wall of beautiful murals- the colors were so vivid and the art work was so alive. Our group started off with some fresh made guacamole- and I mean fresh. The waiter came out with a cart, sliced and diced and prepared it at our table. I ordered the sangria. It came out in a huge glass- didn't have to order a second. Thought it was a little tart but the sugar around the rim was a nice touch to sweeten the pallet. For dinner, of course I had to ask our waiter for his opinion between a couple of dishes. He immediately said the: Cochinita Pibil and so that's what I got. It's a 12 hour slow roasted pork served with grilled veggies, tortillas, and Yucateca. The portion side of pork was amazing. I even surprised myself by finishing it all- but it was that good.  Unfortunately, there was no room for desert.  I will make this place my local stop when visiting in the future.",

It kind of through me for a loop. I mean, its in a very run down neighborhood (Signs say park at your own risk) with bars over windows and doors. You get in, and it looks kind of average, nothing to hint that there are some food gods working behind the wall.  They pretty much do tequilla only here. They have a tequilla list with over 100 tequillas on it. I opted for a simple margaritta with some tequilla I have never heard of and some fresh agave nectar. Wow it was good!  We got the guacamole appetizer, and it was fantasic. All fresh made right at the table. Next we moved onto the shrimp quesedillas. This was kind of an insight as to how complex these meals were going to be. The shrimp quesadillas were very good, so much so I didnt even realize I accidently ate the shrimp tail!   Looking at the menu for dinner, its definatley not your everyday mexican food your going to see here. This is kicked up a notch. I would probably call this gourmet mexican food. Never have I seen such menu items, where everything sounds so fantastic. It was like I was in mexican food heaven! I had the special of the night which was a basted lobster tail in tequilla grilled over an open wood flame, 6oz filet mignon with a langustine/chorizo goat chease mixture on top, and grilled vegetables. I think it was their way of doing the filet 'oscar style'. It was extremely good. Everything turned out fantastic.  My only complaint was parking. It was pretty tight to begin with. Our server was strictly to the point, no lolly gagging around which actually turned out to be good in this instance for us since this was a business dinner.  Would definatley visit again!",

When I got there it was completely packed, and due to the very small amount of space in the restaurant, a bit hard to navigate through.   My table started off with a bunch of appetizers. I found it interesting that they made the guacamole right in front of us, but I couldn't help but think that it was just a gimmick to justify the $11 price tag (and no, it wasn't a lot of guac, just one avocado). The server was nice enough though, albeit a bit rushed, and the flavors were very good. I especially like the tapenade; it was superb.   After the apps came the main courses. I have to respect a place that has a passion for seafood in the middle of the desert. A large portion of Barrio's menu consisted of different variations of shellfish and fish. I ended up ordering the torta with crab meat and chicken. It was pretty good, but I felt that the crab overpowered the whole sandwich, even with the hollandaise sauce that cover nearly every bite. It had a lot of potential, but I'm not sure that I would order it again. On the flipside, I tried their chicken enchiladas and those were great. They are served in a small skillet and they are buried in a sea of delicious toppings. I'm glad Barrio could do this classic some justice and add it's own spin on it.  After taking my last few sips of sangria we began to part from Barrio Cafe with leftovers aplenty. Four people, a $200 tab and the satisfaction of trying a new place. I'm glad I got to go, but I'm not sure when I will be returning. Some people may really enjoy it, some may not.",

I loved the spread but the bread was slightly stale. But eatable.  I was in the more for chips so u got guac it said award winning. It was more of a avocado salad.  Are you staying to see a grand.  But I did like the guacamole it was different with cran raisins.  I ordered carne tacos because the chillrenno sauces scared me.  The meat was high end trays like a roast. Not like asada. The problem wad it was very beefy. I have to say it was gross I should have sent it back.  I know what your thinking beef is beefy. But this was bad. If you want new types of recipes and don't mind paying twenty dollars plate fire a dumpy place with white table clothes go try. There is a lot to like about this place",

I'm a pretty easy going guy with a pretty high tolerance level, however if you piss off the wife you instantly are on my shit list!

Is this your civil service?   On to the food...By far the best dish was the Quesadilla with Langostine Borracho. The langostine was cooked to perfection, it did have a bit of shell but that is something I can deal with. The goat cheese is the flavor that really put it over the top. Nice dish!   The chicken mole was also a winner, however it was lacking in quantity  department with the mole sauce. If you get this dish you typically are ordering it primarily for the sauce. Don't skimp!   The prices are also a bit hefty. The two ladies next to us got their bill and gasped, \"$95 for the two us!\" I don't think you should be surprised by the bill, after-all the prices are on the menu, however be forewarned!   They should get a 4 star for their food but unfortunately the service is still part of the deal. I would go back if I lived in the area minus Gabe to give it another shot.",

For entrees, I was between the shrimp or the fish tacos and asked the server for his advise.  He told me he'd suprise me.  Love it! I ended up with the fish tacos and they were some of the best fish tacos I've ever had.  Coming from San Diego, that's a pretty big feat.

I'm giving it two stars mainly for the mildly racist caricatures drawn all over the menus. They also spelled 'Ensenada' wrong. SMH. Only in Pheonix.",

We ate food that made our head explode because of the fusion of flavor. We started with elote. It was a street elote in a cup. A good step towards the main course. Our plates arrived with  Cochinito Pibil and chiles en nogada. The flavor was over the top. My Chiles had an fun combination of chicken, pomegranate, crema, pecans and chile that was a welcomed distraction from a normal stuffed chiles. Desert was the churros and ice cream combination.  Everything tasted amazing, homemade and made just for you. There was a great little cubano duo playing.   This place is a hit!",

Quality recipes. Complicated tastes. Truly elegant. This is high end cuisine. Service was impeccable. For great food you're going to pay though. Dearly. Lunch: an appetizer, two entrees, two iced teas and tip: $65.00.   Now the negatives. Location: it is in a bad of town. I wouldn't want to be there after dark. I consider this to be a lunch only restaurant. Parking is behind the restaurant which makes a good shield for car burglars. The physical plant is very old. Not well kept. There is a single unisex bathroom which is incredibly small...as in dollhouse small. I was there at 2pm on a Friday. The bathroom had obviously not been serviced from the noon lunch rush. It needed a lot of attention. The restaurant is small overall and incredibly noisy. If you don't cater well to noise and close/crowded spaces, this restaurant is not for you.  This was my first visit. I will definitely go back. The pros outweigh the cons.",

They make guacamole right next to the table. The place manages to do authentic Mexican food in a classy way; most places can only do one or the other well. The margaritas are delicious. Also we brought a family of 8 and they sat us (the place is small so it took a while) but everyone agreed, hands down the best food we've ever eaten. Every time i go back i love it. Way better food than taco guild or other pretenders out there! Im almost sorry to give them such a good review because they may get too busy!",

In addition I wanted to support a business that participated in the immigrant protest. My son took me there for my birthday! The tequila bar was good, the food was delicious. Here's the part that gets tricky. After seeing the desserts on the menu, I knew before I had selected my entree that I wanted the Tres Leche Cake. So after dinner I told our waitress that I would like to try it. She asked me if I had ever had it there before. I replied no, first time in restaurant. She went on to explain that it was dry, not the usual Tres Leche Cake, very  bad and in the same breath handed me the check. Wow! Nothing was offered on the dessert menu instead of the foul Tres Leche she described. Did I mention it was my birthday? I don't even remember details about my food, just the dessert part. I left with a bad taste in my mouth for this place. Did I mention it was my birthday and I absolutely love dessert.  I have shared this story with others who were also speechless and shocked!",

Next, he came to the table unsure whether all three got salads.

    "text": "A group of my friends and I read about Barrio Cafe in The State Press Magazine's \"Best Of\" edition.  Looking to squeeze something new and hopefully exciting out of the Phoenix Metro area, so the six of us decided to try it.  The wait was long...about an hour, and since not everyone was drinking  we waiting outside on a bench directly outside of the bar.  The wait wasn't as long as they said it would be and we were seated in one of the rooms of the low ceiling white wall adobe interior (ok, that makes it sound bad, because of the lighting, it was nice and cozy not stark and confining).  We ordered the Guacamole to start because it is supposed to be their \"signature\" as it is made fresh right in front of your eyes at the table.  Apparently quite the draw for most patrons as our server informed us that  EVERYONE ordered it and that she and the rest of the servers all really hated making it (that made us feel GREAT).  The guacamole was however worth it (even if it was insinuated upon us ordering it that we were 'restaurant tourists')  There were basically no vegetarian options and it was quite the scoffing matter on the part of our server when I requested a substitute of beans on a chicken dish (\"We don't serrrve beans here.\")  I wound up getting the same dish, just without chicken.  All of the dishes (veggie or not) were small for the price (and for being a full dinner).    The margarita I had was tasty, but not enormous (I think it was about $10).  I like a big margarita with Mexican food, call me crazy.  There was a live duo that played for a while during our supper.  They were entertaining, but not too distracting and still allowing for conversation at our table.  Although I wouldn't recommend this place for large groups (it's pretty small), there seemed to be a number of large groups there which I found interesting.  All in all, I'm glad I had the opportunity to check this place out, but it's definitely not first on my list of places to go back to immediately.",

We started the meal off with a generous portion of guacamole...fresh & chunky with added touch of cranberry  Pollo En Mole was good but the mole sauce played only 2 notes sweet and hot, lacking the depth of complexity that I was expecting  The Cochinita Pibil was a major disappointment.  While the texture was soft and succulent (as per 12 hour slow roasting technique quoted in the menu), it needed flavor...we had to resort to giving a good dollop of hot sauce to finish the dish.  The Churros we ended with was delicious with goat milk caramel for an added twist.  However, thought that  the $9.50 price was a bit high for just 2 pieces.  Conclusion:  Good food, but just didn't deliver for the price",

We were greeted by a 45-minuteish wait (it seems many restaurants in Phoenix don't take reservations for parties under six).  We were packed like sardines in the small waiting area, and there's not much around the area to kill time at.  After being seated, my friend and I shared the table-side guacamole (notable only due to the inclusion of pomegranate seeds!  delicious and unique) and posole (good and refreshing, but actually disappointingly bland).  The appetizers were somewhat expensive: 11$ for the guac, which only included one avocado, and 8$ for the soup.  I fell in love with my seafood enchilada: cheesy lump crab meat wrapped in a warm blue corn tortilla, over which chunks of scallops and shrimp are generously scattered.  The whole thing is finished off with a rich, creamy sauce bursting with flavor.  I polished off the whole thing.  The entree ran me 23$.  And yes, it made it to my List (the OMGWTFBBQ List).  Unfortunately, we were too full to try dessert.  Service was solid, and the place emptied out after we were seated around 8:45PM.",

    "text": "I had not had Chiles en Nogada since I was employed in Phoenix... when Barrio Cafe first got it's start in 2002. My visit this week coincided with Mexican Independence Week (September 16). Now is a good a time as any to revisit a delectable, beautifully presented Chiles en Nogada... Barrio Cafe style.  My old friend, who was with me today, was forced by me to try out this entree... just as he was with me at Richardson's Cuisine of New Mexico ( <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/richardsons-cuisine-of-new-mexico-phoenix#hrid:KyAh3bMnKqz4P2xTx6Wl6g\">yelp.com/biz/richardsons...</a> ) on 16th Street and Bethany Home yesterday.   On the menu today...  Chiles en Nogada (**** $21.00) Roasted Poblano Pepper stuffed with marinated Chicken, Onions, Garlic, Pecans, Apples, Pears and Apricots topped with a delicate Almond Sauce and Pomegranate Seeds. First of all, Barrio Cafe has diverged from the name of the entree and how the entree derives it's name. Chiles en Nogada literally means Chiles with Walnut Sauce.... not Almond Sauce. Traditionally, this entree is stuffed with Hamburger or slow marinated Pork... not Chicken. This doesn't bother me that much.... the entree was still delicate and delectable! There is a nice diversity of textures when you consume this Relleno, which is served only after Mexican Independence Day. The Pomegranate Seeds \"pop\" nicely in your mouth as you crunch on them; there is a sweet flavor from the Apple, Pear, and Apricot bits. The savory flavor from the Chicken, Onions, and Garlic provides a nice contrast with the sweetness from the fruit bits. Folks, there isn't much time before Pomegranate season is over with. Try it out!  I have to qualify my initial statement that I hadn't had Chiles en Nogada for seven years... I live in Lodi, California now... and I convinced the owner of an upscale, but affordable Mexican restaurant - Alebrijes Mexican Bistro ( <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/alebrijes-mexican-bistro-lodi#hrid:hV7e7lPCf5qn7sOW0Tyz6g\">yelp.com/biz/alebrijes-m...</a> ) to prepare Chile en Nogada for me! Alebrijes prepares their Chile en Nogada in the more traditional manner with ingredients specified in the original recipe. If you're in Northern California....  Despite the impression I'm giving that I'm bashing Barrio Cafe's preparation of Chiles en Nogada.... One thing that Barrio does correctly is present the Poblano Chile as if it was roasted... the Chile is a very dark green in color. And the overall flavor tastes South of the Border... whereas the Alebrijes Chile is just too perfect... as if it never saw the Rio Grande!  Side of Mashed Potatoes, Grilled Yellow Squash, Cucumbers, and White Onions (*****)  Grilled Perfectly!  Organic Margarita (***** $13.00) Tequila from 4 Copas - Organic Silver Tequila (claims to be the world's ONLY certified Organic Tequila... got to take their word on that claim...) with Organic Agave Nectar, Pomegranate Juice and  Grapefruit Juice. Sweet, Sweet, Sweet.... but GOOD!  Imported Bottle of Mexican Coca-Cola (***** $2.50)  Cafe de la Casa Barrio (**** $8.00) Barrio's own Special Blend of Chiapas Iztapa Coffee served in a cool shiny stainless steel French Press. You've got to try this if you're going Mexican - Your presence in Barrio Cafe mandates Mexican coffee and with it a sense of foreignness, sunshine and fun... and you don't have to worry about a passport. Not as strong as the Coffees from countries South of Mexico... ala Colombia. But, the Coffee is stronger than your garden variety American canned Coffee. A question I have is: Where is the Mexican Coffee with Cinnamon???  Service (*****) Friendly and prompt. The waiter happened to be the brother of the Owner / Chef, Silvana Salcido. The brother / waiter, a Civil Engineer, moved to Phoenix from Las Vegas caused by the downturn in the housing market.   My friend, who is NOT a Mexican Cuisine afficionado, says Barrio Cafe is far better than Richardson's in quality and presentation.  Profusely presented, hopefully for a short period of time, are small (no more than 18\"x18\") paintings by Nikki Aiello... a local Yoga instructor who, it seems, is delving into ethnic painting.  They're no more than a couple of hundred dollars each. My advice to Nikki... \"Don't quit your day job!\" I guess, Barrio Cafe had to fill up the wall space with something...  I hope I don't have to wait another seven years before I try Chiles en Nogada again from Barrio Cafe! But... Please go back to Beef or Pork as the meat filling!",

The backdoor entrance was strange...you have to walk through the restaurant to the hostess podium.    But overall, good food.",

I am up to my ears in cheap enchiladas, bad ground beef tacos and a weak tequila menu.   I love the authenticity of the cuisine offered by this cute little restaurant. It is authentic and unique, because there is a wide variety of regional flavors incorporated into various dishes on the menu. I, being the carniverous hog that I am, chose the Torta de Filetito...hey steak and chorizo with bread?! I am so there...and it was comida chingona. :) Filet, Roquefort cheese and spicy chorizo on toasted crusty bread...The boy had Pollo con Mole Negro. It was my first experience tasting Mole, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and the tasty mashed potatoes and squash that cam with the chicken.   I can't wait to go back and try the Tamarind Glazed Duck Salad.   I was a little disappointed that our service was average at best. The man was nice, but didn't really pay much attention to us. He was a little casual, and although the atmosphere is casual, when you work in a restaurant that doesn't serve your normal americanized mexican fare, you should make an effort to make sure your customers questions are answered.",

We went around 6:30 and only had to wait for maybe 20 minutes.    For an appetizer, I had the Queso Fundido.  It was yummy!  I don't like their chips because they are too hard.  I like them light and crispy.  But I was able to get extra bread from the waiter, which was good.  I like that I was able to order the dip without mushrooms too.    For my entree I ordered Torta de Filetito.  It almost looked like a hamburger.  The beef was okay.  I wish I had ordered it without the roquefort cheese.  I didn't know how strong it was.  I absolutely hated the taste of the cheese.  Nothing special here though.  I did love the churros for dessert!  So delicious!  It came out with chocolate sauce, strawberries, and ice cream.  You definitely have to try it!  Overall, it's okay.  I just don't get all the hype about it.",

    "text": "It was New Year eve 2014 and our first time to try out this neighborhood cafe as it has been highly recommended by the Auto club in its 2013 Arizona tour book for the Phoenix metro area. We ordered a seafood appetizer, the obligatory Cochinita Pibil, as it was the top recommendation by AAA, and el Pato en Tamarindo. The ambiance was excellent and the service was exceptional.   When it comes to food, the Cochinita Pibil was a great disappointment. Cochinita Pibil is supposedly to be slow roasted pork. Such cooking process supposes to seal the fat and the juice in the meat and to prevent the meat from becoming too dry and tough and yet keeping the full natural flavor. Unfortunately, I can only describe that the \"portion of pork\" picked for and served in our plate as an overcooked pulled pork with a mushy texture, similar to that of sardines in a can.  If not because of the sauce, the taste itself was so bland as if the meat has been boiled in water for hours to extract flavor for broth. We left the whole plate untouched after we had the chance to sample it.  On a positive note, the appetizer and the seared duck breast saved the night. The seafood appetizer was not in the regular menu and we were told it was only offered especially for the end of the year. The texture of the shrimp and squid was crunchy and tender. The taste of the sauce was exquisite and it served with three large pieces of toast that one can dunk it into the sauce.  The duck breast was seared perfectly with enough pink. The meat was tender and juicy. The tamarind/chipotle pepper sauce had a kick with a well balance of sweetness and sourness, which complemented real well with the duck meat.",

    "text": "The menu cover was right. \"Comida chingona\" is the only way to describe the cuisine here. Although I had a savory experience, the service was at times awkward. Was my server having a bad day? Hungover? Tired? I don't know, but he didn't make me feel comfortable. At one point he just left without letting me know someone else would be taking care of me. I was waiting for him to come back and he never did. Another man just started talking to me and I didn't even know he was my new server.  Anyway, let's not punish the food on behalf of my server's lack of professionalism. Yes, they served bread with tapenade instead of chips and salsa. So? I was actually happy to see something else being offered. Everyone can serve that, but tapenade? I've actually never had it before but have been meaning to try it. Now I know what it tastes like. Be open to try new things, even at a Mexican restaurant.  I ordered the corn chowder and chile en nogada for my meal. The chowder was probably the best thing out of this whole ordeal. It was sweet without being overbearing and it had a similar taste to a warm cup of cornmeal. I've had corn chowders before but this was different. The corn was definitely the distinguished guest. I didn't even care about the shrimp. It was that good.  I love chiles rellenos and have always wanted to try the other variation: chiles en nogada. Unfortunately I've had a tough time seeing them in menus until now. It took a while for it to be cooked, but the wait was worth it. Albeit, the chile itself is not spicy, the contents are sweet and fresh. Chicken combined with raisins and other fruit was a different spin to Mexican food. I'm all about spice and heat, and I liked the cooler aspect of this dish. The almond sauce is light and the pomegranates add tiny explosive bursts of flavor.  The side vegetables were good as well. I'll be honest though, this was the first time I've seen a Mexican restaurant serve mashed potatoes as a side dish. But hey, I'm open to new things! I loved the idea of having the horchata inside recycled Coke bottles. It was refreshing in both concept and flavor. I don't like too much sugar, and this horchata had the perfect sweetness to it. What I would do for some corn chowder and horchata from a Coke bottle...  I was REALLY tempted to try the churros filled with cajeta, but I didn't dare. I was extremely full. Thank you for the food, even though I had to put up with some messed up service to obtain in.",

    "text": "My excitement about eating here was dampened a bit the moment we walked in the door and it was too cold in the restaurant.  Anyway, I let that go, and we ordered our food, fresh guacamole, and shrimp tacos.   Before our food came, we were served a basket of bread with an olive topping on the side.  Now, this should have been amazing: it wasn't.  The bread was somewhat stale, and chewy--and not in a good way. The olive garnish was nearly flavorless. Okay, on to the main course.  The good: The salad that came with the tacos was very good, with nice greens, dried fruits, and a flavorful vinager-based dressing.  And the guacamole--although overpriced at $12.--was quite fresh and nice, and the inclusion of pomegranate seeds was a nice surprise.  The bad:  The shrimp tacos were simply awful. The tortillas were rubbery and weird tasting, and the heavily breaded shrimp were mushy, and the breading was undercooked, and not crispy at all. Any food truck taco would have killed the Barrio Cafe tacos we had.  If you want great Mexican food, that is fresh and well prepared, I highly recommend La Santisima.  It is an amazing place, with a brilliant menu, and a great atmosphere.  Salud!",

I didn't love the chips which was just as well I don't need the extra calories. That said, the reason I give 5 stars is the staff.  The manager was sweet and accommodating and the waitress was also helpful and professional.  You will love this place.",

It's been a while since we last ate here, and now remember why. Food and drinks are very expensive for what you get. $13 table side guacamole is ridiculous. They used to actually cut open the avocado in front of you, now someone puts a bowl of chopped avocado and the waiter adds toppings and barely mixes. Really? $13 for this?  The $13 margaritas were not that great. More ice than anything.   What I failed to remember up until the first bite was how items were luke warm at best. The squash veggie side was barely warm, as if heated in a microwave. The enchiladas suiza was hotter, but I could tell the ingredients weren't just made. The chicken was dry. Flashback to the two previous visits. My dinner companion's potato side was also barely warm, and the poblano plate was luke warm. Considering you are paying high prices to sit in what once was a store front in a mini mall, it adds a sour and queasy note.   The churro dessert was delicious. I feel that once you order, the service drops off. As the hype built over the years around this place, the owner and management have figured out how to exploit it. After $120, had diner's remorse when leaving.   Suggest going for HH and dessert. Then go somewhere else for the full meal. Sorry Barrio!",

Even though it was a busy night, we were seated relatively fast  (about 10 minutes). I had fish tacos & she had Enchiladas de Mole. Both were decent but I do not feel they were worth the price - our total bill came out to be $60 for two people. While I believe that this place has great customer service, I think it is too pricey for me! Also, the place was VERY loud. There was a few times that my friend & I would have to yell across the (small) table to be able to hear each other.",

    "text": "I had read such great reviews of Barrio Cafe, and was greatly looking forward to trying the cuisine. Chef Silvana had been awarded Best Chef in Phoenix by the New Times this past year, and Barrio had won multiple awards for its cuisine. I had high hopes and a little bit of fear of disappointment because of my expectations. The decor of the restaurant is colorful and welcoming. There is a huge mural of \"Phoenix\" out in the parking lot, local artists' work on the walls, and a unisex one stall bathroom with the largest collection of crucifixes I have seen that's not in a museum. Our waitress was very attentive and laid-back (she had glasses and a shaved haircut with a bun- I recommend her!), and we ordered the guacamole, the signature Chiles en Nogada and a seafood tostada. When the Chiles en Nogada came, I sliced a hefty forkful and dipped the savory pepper in its white sauce surrounded by pomegranate seeds. As I swallowed my bite, a rush of fresh flavors exploded in my mouth. In about 5 minutes, I had eaten the whole dish!! I was not even ashamed - I wish I had more, just writing this. What makes the Chiles en Nogada ridiculously good is the creativity and flair that goes into the dish. Not only this dish, but the other items at the table create an amazing tapestry of flavors that is a new twist to Mexican cuisine. I absolutely cannot wait to come back!",

Absolutely adored this guacamole, because I love when there's, well was it pomegranite seeds or cranberries (?), whatever it was..it just makes the guac a little sweeter and gives it a different taste. It was served with really thick baked tortilla chips. We accompanied this guac with a yummy sangria and my hubby had a margarita.   Next, the Quesadilla Langosta Boraccha. This had garlic and tequila lobster on corn tortillas covered with Oaxacan cheese and another white cheese. The waitress couldn't be excited enough to have us try it, and I'm glad we ordered it because it was that good!  Cochinita pibil - the achiote seasoning really set this 12 hour  slow roasted pork off!  Enchilada del Mar - Oh-so-rich enchiladas with lobster, scallops and crab topped with queso de cabra!  Since we live so far, I decided to order the Flan de mi Mami and Churros Rellenos.  Yes, we could not help but order dessert too because we don't know our limits. Churros are perfect! The flan was thick, the right texture, consistency, and flavor (just like my best friend's mom from Guadalajara makes it)!   Since we came on a Sunday, they had a guitarist playing from noon until 2pm. He played all traditional classic songs on his Spanish guitar. It felt \"just right\" being there. I can see what all the hype is about! It is on the pricer side so go here if you want something extra flavorful and with a different edge.",

You get sourdough bread and red pepper and olive tapenade. Very tasty.   I ordered the mushroom and spinach enchiladas.  They don't serve beans.   The air conditioning does not handle the people ovens and outdoor temps. It is hot in here.   They turned away several parties of 5 or more because of their wait times.    Dinner took a long time coming.   The enchiladas were more like small tacos in a corn tortilla. The cheese was excellent and the mushrooms and spinach as well.   Every well done. THere was a side of corn and onions and zucchini.   There was a sour cream topping. THis is recommended.",

    "text": "Solid. We hit up the happy hour which features 50% off booze and tacos for $1.50. I had the duck, shrimp, and cochinita pibil (pork). They were tinier than most street-style tacos I've had (and boy howdy, have I eaten a lot of those from Cali to NY) and  even a little soggy. The duck was my least favorite as it had a rubbery taste and texture. The shrimp was A-OK but for my money, the cochinita was really where it's at with his super-porkey deliciousness. We also split the queso fundido (rich with cream cheesey chunks, whaaaat???). It was way tasty but it could probably double for spackle in a pinch. The most successful item of the night was the churros with goat cheese caramel. Between my 3 buddies and myself, we made quick work of that dish. Each of us had their house margarita which was strong (just like I like it), but I'm not entirely sure I'd order that drink for non-happy hour prices. One of the big drawbacks, however, was that our server was really rushed and we had a hard time getting his attention.   On the whole, I think I'd be back to try some other items. The chicken mole torta looked really appealing. Be forewarned though, it IS a spendy joint. Expect to pay $15 - $20 for most entrees. On a post-grad shoestring budget, it is certainly a splurge. We did love the mural outback and the groovy art inside.",

    "text": "You know you're in for a fun experience as soon as you walk in the door. Vintage Mexican movie posters line the hallway, while works by local artists brighten the walls in the two dining rooms. The tables are lit by tall votive-candle glasses embossed with pictures and mini-bios of various saints. Be sure to visit the restroom - wildly painted, adorned with colorful tiles, and decorated with crucifixes, statues of the Virgin Mary, and pictures of Jesus, its somewhat irreverent and completely unexpected atmosphere is sure to stun you and make you smile. As will the food. Despite the name, there's nothing barrio about the cuisine, an eclectic mix of south-of-the-border dishes that eschews the typical combination platters that are geared towards gringo palates in favor of colonial Mexican cooking. As if to emphasize the fact that this is no Chevy's, the traditional chips and salsa are replaced by a basket of French bread with a tapenade of olives, garlic, and capers. Do not miss Guacamole Casero, which is prepared fresh tableside. A ripe avocado, moistened with olive oil, white vinegar, and a splash of balsamic vinegar, is mashed with onions, tomato, cilantro, and pomegranate seeds, and served with topopos (round, fried, chiplike corn tortillas). The chef best displays her successful break from the familiar with the entrees. Seared duck breast is sweet, spicy and tart, aided by the addition of a tamarind and chipotle sauce. Seafood enchiladas are comprised of blue corn tortillas rolled with scallops, cheese, and crab, and topped with a trio of meaty shrimp. The chile en nogada is a large poblano pepper stuffed with apples, pears, raisins, pomegranate seeds, chicken, and smothered in an almond cream sauce. The bar stocks nearly 200 brands of tequila, wine from Valle de Guadalupe in Baja California, and a variety of Mexican beers, in addition to domestic selections. The extraordinary quality of the food is not reflected in the prices - all entrees are $20.00 or less.",

    "text": "I was in town on business and so I did the solo dinner out at Barrio Cafe.  Usually solo dinners go by quickly for me, since I'm usually just hungry, ready to go back to my hotel room after a long day on the road, and most importantly, nobody interesting to chat with over dinner.  I expected to spend 30 minutes there, tops.  Well, the food was so fantastic that I definitely lingered - probably about an hour.  Not exactly a world record for longest dinner, but a long time to be sitting at a table in a restaurant by yourself.  I didn't care since the cuisine was so good.  I started off with their signature guacamole - prepared tableside.  It was excellent and served with a basket of slightly greasy homemade tortilla chips.  The pomegranate seeds in the guac were a nice, unique addition.  I toyed around with several different potential selections for my entree, but at the waitress' recommendation settled on the stuffed pepper.  It was stuffed with chicken, fruits, nuts and a pleasant sauce.  I only wish there had been more of the stuffing.  It was fantastic.  I have to tell you I was thinking about ordering one of their tortas, but after making an offhand comment about good torta bread, the waitress advised me that it was served on a french roll.  The idea of a french roll taking the place of a soft, authentic torta bun turned me off, so I went with the stuffed pepper.  In retrospect, given the quality of the cuisine I ordered, I'm sure the torta would've been good - my preconceived notions of torta bread notwithstanding.  I finished off my meal with the churros.  Two homemade churros filled with creme caramel, drizzled with caramel, candied pecans,vanilla ice cream and raspberries - unbelievable.  The place was small and intimate.  Excellent food and a welcoming vibe, despite obviously being a place not frequently visited by out of towners.  Highly recommended.",

Everything is good.)  I went in to this place to hear a couple of my music buddies play near the beginning of 2010.  I knew nothing of the food or the place.  Because I was by myself, I got a table immediately which was not normal on a Saturday.  (There was a line out of the door at 8:30pm.)  I got to the third item on the menu as described below:  \"C H I L E S  en  N O G A D A Roasted poblano pepper stuffed with chicken, onions,garlic, pecans, apples, pears and apricots finished with a delicate almond sacue and pomegranates $21\"  I didn't read any further.  This is what I ate.  It was one of the most interesting and tasty entrees I have ever had in Phoenix.  I was thinking about it all week,  I tried to describe it to my wife but I couldn't.  The people who claim that the parking and neighborhood are less than ideal are not lying, but it's not that bad.   Honestly, I would risk having my car stolen to eat this food.  Heck, I might risk stealing your car to have this food.  Look, if you want safe, I'm sure you have a Chili's near your house that will gladly allow you to share your money with them.  I want to give the place 5 stars, but I think all I had was this one entree and probably water.   I remember liking the olive and bread that came before the meal, but my recollection is blurred by the Chiles en Nogada.  I really need to go back to verify if this will be a long term thing or a one-time fling.",

Upon entry we were met with the sounds of a lone singer belting out a ballad of not so sweet tones and were sat at a table for two. Hugo, our server, promptly arrived to take our drink order...water and iced tea, more like iceless tea sitting in a pitcher on rolling cart in the middle of the dining area that was bled down to a murky tea tinted water mixture. I ask Hugo to bring us a glass of full strength tea from the source not the openly exposed watered down pitchers on the cart. Low and behold, my wife received a glass straight from the pitcher! Arrg! I asked again for some undiluted tea and received a glass of just as diluted tea from a different pitcher sitting on the bar in the other room! Note...this will be last time we see Hugo at our table until our food arrives, not one refill is offered as my glass lays devoid of water throughout our entire meal. I ordered fish tacos and spicy fries, my wife ordered an omelet with zucchini. The tacos were literally the size silver dollar pancakes, the tortillas were not warmed. They encapsulated one inch long battered fish pieces that were 60% batter and mushy to boot. Appetizer portions at best. The fries were undercooked and limp. The wife proclaimed her omelet as pretty good but unremarkable. Not being much of Yelp reviewer, but a regular reader/user, this experience pushed me to change that...",

We waited over an hour and there was little space available, but being able to buy margaritas at the bar made it all more tolerable. The drink menu is excellent and fairly priced.  The guacamole, which is made at the table, is incredible.  I've never had guac with pomegranate seeds, but it was a perfect mix, as it added a bit of sweetness.  My only recommendation is to not have the cheese added.  It adds a weird flavor and consistency, but not enough to ruin the guacamole, just a little strange. I had the Enchiladas de Hongos, which were quite tasty, however the sauce was sooooo thick and heavy that it somewhat overshadowed the food it covered.  Again, not enough to make it inedible, but just overpowering and detracted a bit from enjoying the rest of the flavors of the dish. Didn't get a chance to get dessert, but maybe next time.  I would definitely give this another try.",

Chicken, apples, pears, pecans, onions, garlic, almonds chopped and stuffed into a Poblano chile, lightly covered with a nice almond cream sauce. To one side a dash of cilantro, bits of Pomegranate on the other. Everything tasted like it was meant to be there, every ingredient made perfect sense together, leaving a smile after each bite. This dish was unique and like nothing I have tasted elsewhere. As previous reviewers have mentioned, yes this place is a bit more on the nicer, upscale side, I suppose if pressed I would call it some sort of creative Mexican fusion. If you are looking for dive-y authentic burritos, tacos and enchiladas this is not the place, there are a million other places in the area offering that style of Mexican food where the Mexican folk are lined out the door. I love those places just as much... for everything that they have to offer. Now if you want a unique, original, clever, new take on the Mexican dining experience then you should definitely give this place a try and see for yourself what all the hype is about.",

I was all excited to try some new dishes and have a cool unique dining experience.  The interior is very reminiscent of a quaint mom and pop restaurant.  The idea of the guac made at your table side is great and it did taste pretty good but it was certainly not worth the price.  I ordered the shrimp tacos and there was so much sauce on it that it was getting all over the place (namely my face)!  The dish did taste good but I am not a fan of corn tortillas (and that's all they have here).   I did finish my meal but later on had the worst stomach pains (probably due to the assortment of flavors in the guac, the house salad and my shrimp tacos).        Maybe I should give it another shot?  Possibly I should have ordered the fish tacos?  All I can think about now is that the shrimp tacos remind me of the shrimp quesadilla at Gecko Grill In Gilbert (and it's half the price and never made me sick).",

Amazing guacamole, delicious tapenade for your bread, but be sure to save room. The posole verde soup is another home run. Honestly, I read the negative reviews of this place and could not understand how this was possible. Innovative, satisfying, absolutely top notch cooking and service. The criticisms of others strike me as bizarre. If you like fine dining and you like Mexican, Barrio is an incredible find.",

Being a serious tequila lover I was bummed that my first four picks weren't available. Got the table side gauc which was alright but I recommend getting it without the pomegranate seeds. The fish was just middle of the road alright but the traditional enchilada with the addition of churizo was killer!!!",

    "text": "This place from the onset has very cool \"Latino Mural Graffiti Art\" everywhere and it looks really nice and has a different vibe from your typical Mexican restaurant. Barrio is a sit-down place but neither a taco shack nor a cantina. They try i a little bit harder on their menu and don't try to fill you up on beans and rice. This means their dishes are more direct and have to provide flavor. Whomever created this menu has attempted to be a creative culinary artist by using your not so typical ingredients whilst giving the food that homemade feel to it. It was fun to try their take on guacamole, which had pomegranate in it. That was interesting, though, never again please. Some things just don't go. One of the members of my party actually uttered the words \"Ruined the Guac\" when describing it. LOL. I'm pretty sure we were content with our dishes, but that's not what left us bothered. It was the prices.  $15 for mediocre white wine $11 for a tiny margarita, perhaps even less tequila - quality of said tequila? $11 for the questionable and tiny bowl of Guac - can be eaten in 3 gulps $11 for Corn chowder with Spicy Shrimp - only 1 measly shrimp $9 for a beer -------------- That's already $60 not including dinner entrees!  It would be nice to be able to tell you that the food and service absolutely substantiated the cost, but it did not. Rather, you're just left wondering why you're over-paying for Mexican food that has minimal quality upgrade over the sub-par offerings of Mexican-style food that currently plague our society. Most people don't or will ever get to eat the decent better-than-average and better than the \"traditional\" kind of Mexican food that when prepared correctly, blows your mind and taste buds.   I say, if you want to try eating a different take on Mexican style fare and are willing to pay for it (and you will), then why not?! However, you could also probably get the best tacos you've ever had at a non-flashy hole-in-the-wall locale all the same. Agree or disagree, I'm just saying....and paying.",

I've eaten mole in probably 30 restaurants all over the country and this is the most luscious, complex, transporting recipe I've had. Perfectly balanced with a sophisticated exoticness and just the right amount of heat. Chicken was juicy. Mom had fish tacos, just fabulous. As everyone says, definitely get the guacamole, the addition of the pomegranate seeds makes a perfect balance with the tangy avocado and crispy, fresh chips, just droolworthy. Try one of the tequilas neat, they have so many varieties, I especially love Herradura Anejo which you don't find a lot. Service is usually quite good, the servers are knowledgeable and if they're not slammed will be happy to give recommendations. When its really busy they can be a little slow.   Yes, its pricey. Yes, you'll probably have to wait a looooooong time for a table (weekend dinner - fugedaboudit)  and there are few places to sit while you do so make sure grandma has her cane, mine was pissed she had to stand so long. But after her quesidillas and tequila she was a happy nana.",

    "text": "My burning question after walking out the door of Barrio Cafe on a Thursday afternoon was \"was it overpriced?\" That appears to be several other reviewers' issue with this place, and I'll answer that right up front: NO.  Firstly, it's not Tex Mex, New Mexican or Sonoran style Mexi food. It's classic, middle of Mexico style with appropriate innovations or surprises that really are worth stepping out of the tradition (i.e., craisans in the guac).  Which brings me to the other highly debated Yelp issue -- $11 guacamole. We came for lunch, so did not get the table side presentation, so right off that seems like a bust on the price. However, it was fucking tasty. I don't know, stuff that like normally infuriates me, but I did not think it was out of place here. The chips that came with it were awesome. Handmade, thicker tortilla pieces that weren't too greasy.  The service was great and unlike other reviewers, we had zilch wait. Here's the thing, if you really want to try this place and know there's a crazy long wait, suck it up and wait and don't complain about it, don't go on a Friday night, don't go at all, or try to go when is likely to be less busy, like a weekday lunch or early dinner.   I loved my cochinta pibil street tacos. The slow roasted pork was rad, the cotija cheese wonderful and the optional fries were a fun touch (i was not a fan of either sauce that came with them, some sort of spicy chipotle ketchup and a weird mustard). My sister was not in love with her poblano chile torta. It was oozing with cheese and she didn't think it had a \"meaty\" quality to make for a good sandwich. The bread it came out on, a crusty French loaf, was an interesting touch and good.   Would I come back? Yes. Would I tell others to go? Absolutely. Will I go on a Saturday night? No. I hate waiting an hour for a table so will go when I don't have to do that. Problem solved.",

The expensive guac was excellent as usual, but the roll up cart for the guac production would not fit in between the tables so we missed the \" show.\"  The drinks at the bar were fresh tasting and refreshing considering the 110 degree heat. My mole chicken was tender, the sauce appropriately spicy. Churro desert was split between four adults.  Lots of chocolate and caramel, although churro was not crispy.  Overall fun for groups.",

I was so happy, because being the only female on the team, means, I only get one chance to make a good impression, if they hate it, that's it my vote is revoked forever! lol. I ordered Chile Nogada, Chef Sylvana's signature dish. AMAZING! My boss had the cochinito poblano, I tasted that dish as well, my God, I had no idea meat could actually melt in your mouth!

    "text": "I was super excited to try this place after hearing about how amazing it is for years. We started off ok, with good, unique sangria and fantastic horchata served in Mexican Coke bottles. 37 bucks (not including tip) for those 4 drinks, but they were good. 45 min was estimated wait for table. Stretched out into well over an hour (I didn't look at my watch so I'm not sure), but hostess was nice and apologetic, so I'm still ok. Then, the troubles start when we finally got to the table. Weird dry ciabatta bread with an ok tapenade to start. Esquites (a corn dish) for an appetizer was really yummy. Finally happier, briefly. I then ordered a beer, and that's the last we saw of our waitress for at least 20-30 minutes. No beer; no chance to order food. She then came back to get our order; had to ask for beer again. She was not charming at all, barely polite with a somewhat snooty, cold attitude. Another long wait for food. When it finally came, my fish was tragically overdone and dry with a side of uninspired zucchini. Hubby got the duck. Sauce was good, but the duck was so rare it was chewy. Daughter liked her black mole, but the rest of us thought it was too bitter. Other daughter's carne asada tacos were good, but the French fries on the side had a weird bland chile dust and no salt. I love potatoes in every form, and these were just plain awful. We're planning on dessert, but it was never offered and after another long wait for our check, we just wanted to get out of there. It wasn't just us either, another group that came in after us waited for their table for probably an hour (this is at 9:30pm) and finally left after being ignored while there were plenty of tables that had opened up. The 2nd star is only because of the horchata and corn, which were glimpses of what this place must have been to earn all the prior accolades. Seriously, Poca Cosa in Tucson has a similar style of food, but blows the doors off this place. No comparison.",

It wasn't awful by any means, but it wasn't worth the 45-minute wait my friend and I endured last night for a table. The guacamole was perfectly serviceable, with the addition of pomegranate seeds a very nice touch.  It was probably the best thing we ate. The other appetizer, a queso fundido, was under salted and straightforward. Likewise the Yucatan pork tacos, which I thought were utterly unremarkable. We also ordered chicken enchiladas with a black mole. I enjoyed the sauce, but my friend thought it was too molasses-y. And even so, I thought the sauce a little one-note. All chocolate, not much else.   Oh, and the tortillas? Not even in the same ballpark as Tortillaria Sinaloa. I'm telling you Baltimore, you don't know how good you've got it.",

It was great (and huge!). I'm vegetarian, and it was one of only a few things on the menu I could eat, but it was good enough that I'd go back, despite the lack of veggie variety.  I also had two house margaritas, which were great. Strong lime flavor, not too sweet. The waitress told me that the more premium margaritas are better because the lime juice is fresh, but these were good enough that I didn't want to upgrade.  The decor is rustic trendy. Not too fancy, but clearly decorated with care. Nice old wooden tables, leather and iron chairs, everything a little uneven in places. It's a great place.",

    "text": "EASILY my favorite Mexican Restaurant in PHX... hands-down. We've been here several times and I have no idea why I've waited until now to tell the world how yummy this place is.   It's VERY small and can get busy, but it's worth the wait! Drinks are great, margaritas are a perfect balance of alcohol and mixer, and there are plenty of marg choices!   On the most recent trip, I started with the Lobster Quesadilla and it's nothing short of perfect. For the main course, I had the Chiles en Nogada, which is a poblano pepper full of chicken, pecans, apples, pears, apricots and spices with some white sauce, oaxaca cheese and pomegranate seeds on the side. This was recommended by my server and it was my favorite meal here so far. It was a perfect balance of flavors that I wouldn't have (and initially upon ordering didn't) expect. On my previous trip I had tacos and my friend had chicken with mole sauce on it, and she explained it was the best mole he's EVER had.   Service is always great, not too overbearing but always there to quickly refill drinks and take your order or bring your check. I love its chill vibe but fun/authentic atmosphere. When out of towners want to know where to find the best Mexican food in a town full of it, this is where we tell them to go. It's not as touristy as other Mexican restaurants, but that's one of my favorite things... it's not overly cheesy (literally and figuratively). :)",

    "text": "Saw an AZCentral article that lists Barrio Cafe as the \"No.1 Mexican restaurant in the United States\" by Tabelog. Seeing this the wife and I were really excited to try it out. I have had really good Mexican food all over the country and Phoenix has some of the best.  The wife and I drove down to Phoenix for dinner and was surprised by all the cool art on the outside of the building. Inside was loud and cramped. Being so cramped the staff kept bumping into each other and occasionally the customers too. I usually dont mind how a restaurant looks, I'm there for the food.  The first thing I noticed when opening the menu was the high prices. Some dishes are over $20 and I've noticed the prices have gone up referencing past menu prices. I'm one that doesn't mind paying a high price for food but it better be worth it. We ordered the $11 Guacamole del Barrio which is supposed to be prepared table-side for dinner but we didn't get that treatment. Nor did we get the complimentary bread and salsa that others on Yelp have said they received. We also ordered the carne asada tacos and fish tacos each dish at over $13 for street tacos. The taco dishes came with fries or a salad. We opted for the fries which are the thick cut style fries w/seasoning. Service was really slow.  I went from being excited about the food to being underwhelmed. The carne asada tacos were good and the beef tender. The fish tacos were good as well and the fish crispy. The Guacamole had pomegranates which were a nice addition. The fries were so-so. The food was good but nothing special. I was expecting to be wowed by the amazing \"No.1 in the United States\" kinda food but felt let down.    The bill was almost $60 for Mexican food that was nothing special. I have had better in the valley at multiple places and haven't had to pay nearly those kinda prices. Must be the chef hype we are paying for. All in all I felt rooked. I really hate to feel that way about a restaurant especially one that has received really good reviews.   I dont think we will be back due to the high prices for over-hyped food.",

Came here for my wedding anniversary on a Friday night at 6:30 pm and was worried that we would have to wait. I tried to call twice and got the answering machine. We had a half hour drive so we decided to go for it. As we were on our way my wife was able to call them and they said about a half hour wait so I thought let's do it.  As we got there I saw an empty table and were seated right away. Bonus!  Nothing fancy for the decor but a home feeling and nice and casual.  Was brought to our table and quickly had a basket of bread and salsa. The bread was so soft and the salsa was an olive base salsa which was awesome.   We started with the Fresh Guacamole with Pomegranate Seeds which was prepared on a cart in front of our table. The waiter asked which ingredients we would like to add in and then he mixed the guacamole in front of us. Excellent and fresh! Would highly recommend.   Wanted to order some of the traditional mexican food such as the street tacos but ended up going with what the waiter recommended and was not sorry for what we ordered on recommendation.   We shared the Pescado Del Mar and the Filete Mignon Tita.   The Pescado Del Mar was a filet of Halibut topped with shrimp, scallops and crab, and a shallot of white wine cream sauce finished with longaniza chorizo sausage and Carmelized onion.  The Filete Mignon Tita was prepared as requested and was one of the most tendor filets I have ever had. Also came with a chipotle mash potatoes that was excellent.   We finished with the Churros Rellenos which were 2 churros with a large scoop of ice cream topped with caramel and candied pecans.  What a great evening of dining and celebrating a special occasion.",

Drinks: Diet Coke ($2.75) & pressed coffee ($3.50)  The guac was mixed with pomegranates, cilantro and onion. It was a different take on guac but delicious. Carne asda tacos on point. The fries come crispy & spicy but was able to get them without the spice. Definitely take the servers recommendation to top the enchiladas with chorizo my husband is picky and he enjoyed the dish. The churros were warm & gooey with caramel paired with vanilla bean ice cream. Also, I've never had pressed coffee and now I don't think I can drink it any other way. Thanks to the barrio for that. The building itself is covered in graffiti art. If you get there when they open you're able to take pictures without cars blocking the view. Inside the restaurant they have paintings that go along with the theme. Our server was one of the best we've had and made our experience that much better. Parking is in the back.",

We ordered cochinito pibil and the chiles en hogada as well as a tamando and orchata aguas frescas which come served in glass coca cola bottles (cute and unique touch).   Food was great! Very flavorful and portions fairly generous. The aguas frescas reminded me of what I would get if I was in Mexico.Super Rich. More of a sweet treat after your meal then a beverage though (that's a good thing). Just a suggetion, have plain water with your meal to Truely appreciate the array of flavors in each dish. But don't skip on the aguas. Just save it for last   Service was great, the team there truly runs like a well oiled machine. Food came quick and hot and drinks were nice amd cold. Didn't have to ask for anything, high chair  bread basket  plain water  ice cups in case ur too fancy for the coke bottle  the bill   Only thing that was a bit uncomfortable was a lady that might have been management overseeing the not just the staff and front door but also tje guests from afar but never actually greeted customers. Made me feel like I was being watched and timed.   Anyhow, Decor is nice and simple. Place was very clean.   I definitely recommend and would eat here again.",

There was a little wait time, so they brought out delicious guacamole and chips as well as bread with a tapenade.    I had the lime water which was so refreshing and the Chile En Nagado which was delightful!  I only had it twice before in Mexico and each version is a little different. What a joy!  My daughter and son in law went with the breakfast items... so many egg dishes to choose from but I was on a mission.  We invited a single elderly patron to join us.  He gave us the low down on the menu as he has visited frequently for Baseball season.  Ha ha he had 2 breakfasts and menudo that was a lot of food!  I was super happy it was flavorful without being spicy.  My kids dishes were very spicy for them.  Everyone has a difference in tolerence,  I'm all about flavor instead of spice.  My side dishes of squash and potatoes were delightful as well.  To be honest I boxed half and had the other part for dinner, so excellent portion sizes!  We enjoyed the live music as well.  The staff was great.  I would rather it take awhile and have fresh delicious food than mediocre food quickly!  I'm definitely coming back. I picked up an order of the Chile En Nagado to go for my Father and he was delighted as well!    **note  to self parking and entrance is in the rear of building.",

They serve it with a shot of Jack Daniels and it tastes like juice.  Finally the churros are soooooooo delicious. Who doesn't like fried lard sticks dipped in cinnamon and sugar filled with caramel?!!! Dude, move over Disneyland churros and Costco churros, this is your bling bling cousin!!!  My entree- some halibut, was lack luster. I didn't enjoy it as much as it was hyped up to be. Presentation of it looked like something that came out of a buffet line- messy and uninspired.  Tried a nibble of the famous 16 hour pork as well and I was underwhelmed.  In conclusion- come here for perhaps a snack? They were incredible.",

We had a house margarita while waiting, possibly one of the worst I've ever had, but then we were given another one for free, which I did drink so it wasn't undrinkable.  They give each table bread with a red pepper and olive tapenade, which I thought was amazing.  We had their guacamole--they make it table side and add pomegranate seeds, it was really good.

This restaurant did the catering at the Desert Botanical Garden for Via De Los Muertos and that is where I descovered their cuisine.   Decided to celebrate my b'day here and it was a great choice.  Had been trying for several months to have dinner there but they were always closed on  the one night we were available to go out.  Finally!!!   There was about a 40 minute wait for a table as they were packed.  Normally I will not wait more than 10 minutes anywhere for a table.  While waiting decided to have a guava margarita at their bar.  great tasing drink.  tV ery tiny, maybe 6 seats total.  Understand they have bought the place next door and will be expanding which is exactly what they need.    We both decided on their house specialty of the roast pork.  great choice.  Very large pile of deliciously cooked pork was surrounded by mashed potatoes and zucchini.  It is enough for at least 2 meals.  I will go back for more but next time find out when they are not as crowded. We were there on at Sat just before 8pm so possibly a few hours earlier or even later. Very reasonably priced for the food.",

    "text": "GO HERE.  I moved to PHX a year ago and had never been.  My mom came to visit, so upon the recommendation of coworkers, I took her here.  WOW.  First, the complimentary tapenade and baguette was verrrry tasty.  We also ordered the guacamole - we aren't big salt-eaters, so it was a little salty to us, but the FLAVORS.  So good... tiny diced red onion, cilantro, pomegranate seeds...  amazing.  We both scoured the menu, which looked great, and coincidentally ordered the same entree - - enchiladas suiza.  Again, so many different flavors that were just perfection.  Zucchini was huge and perfectly cooked. The dish was a little rich, but the flavors were out of this world.  What we couldn't eat we took with us.  We went on a weekend and there was a guitar duo...  we cracked up at the Mexican version of a Bob Marley song.  They were great.  The artwork is pretty cool... even in the co-ed bathrooms there is interesting artwork to see.  The people at the table behind us kept raving about the mole sauce.  I'll definitely be back to try it.  :)",

    "text": "I had to be in the area for an evening appointment and had some time, so I looked in the area for restaurants and found the Barrio. The location was in a little rough of an area - I missed it the first time and had to go around the block. It's a couple of spots in an old dumpy strip mall and very small. The parking was deplorable. You have to go around the back to an alley, and spots are cramped and just asking for fender bumps and door scratches. The parking is probably about half the capacity - I'm not sure how they can meet the zoning rules.   Inside the decor was nice - some interesting furniture pieces. It was very crowded - a good sign. I was lucky didn't have to wait long for a table. It seemed like a lot of folks were hanging out - I was there for more than an hour, and didn't see many tables change over.   The menu is unique - but makes it hard to know what you're ordering. I ordered T A C O S  de  C O C H I N I T A   P I B I L - slow roasted pork - the pork was unimpressive. It was a bit mealy - like a lower quality roast. There was a decent amount - no sides. The sauce was interesting and different. I didn't really care for the flavor, but that was my taste. It was a distinctive flavor that I'm sure others would like. I had the choice of fries or a salad - which seemed odd. The salad was the highlight for me. It was a delicious blend of romaine with dried cranberries and queso. The menu was eclectic enough that I would like to try some other items.   The service was ok. The waiter was efficient if not overly helpful. I wasn't ordering a lot or an expensive meal, so it seemed like there wasn't any interest on his part.   The food was pricey for what it was. The quantity was pretty reasonable - I would have preferred one or two less tacos and some sides for a little variety. I might go back, but would need a compelling reason to go to that location and at that price.",

I did NOT like the bread and olive salsa and was terribly disappointed not to have chips and salsa, since this is one of my favorite things about Mexican type eating out. I hate olives. The shrimp tacos were OK. I ordered a margarita and was not too wild about it. It was strong, which I guess is nice, but it was not very tasty and there was a LOT of ice involved. With so many other options for Mexican food, I won't go back.",

When you get there on Sunday between 10 - 2 you are greeted by live music at the front of the restaurant and confining atmosphere.  So when you arrive expect to be sitting close to someone you don't know.  The wall are decorated by local artists that are trying to sell their work.  Once the waiter comes to your table he does his normal thing and then a small dish of salsa and basket of bread arrives so you and your friends can eat a little something while you wait.  The food is good but pricy, when you take your first bite every taste bud will be stimulated and you just want to take another bite to get that same rush.  I have only been to this restaurant for brunch so I am not sure what the dinner service is like.  During brunch it can take some time to be seated and get your order so don't go here expecting to get in and get out.  Sit back enjoy the music and have a good time with your friends.  I felt the wait was worth it.",

We didn't have wow experience in this place. For the quality of food and service prices are way too high. I had tacos de camarones which were rather bad. Battered shrimp were oily and not properly peeled. I caught myself spitting out shrimp shell. Tortilla shells were very oily and chewy. I thought I was eating a piece of paper. The taste was also disappointing nothing but spicy mayo. Friends have carne asado tacos which they thought were good but not as good as at La Santisima. Service is not good either. We weren't even offered water and forced to wait for the bill for 20 min after finishing our food. The place has unique ambiance though with cool murals outside the restaurant. However I'd not recommend this place to my friends since quality vs cost isn't comparable. Lunch for three people with half priced drinks was $86 without tip",

From a street view Bario Cafe doesn't look like much but once you sit and taste the food a smile will come to your face.   Once we arrived we were promptly seated and enjoyed the guacamole along with a few horchata's; both were excellent.  I ordered the chicken mole enchiladas and they were delicious.  The depth of flavor of the sauce was incredible and the chicken was moist, flavorful, was very tender.  My lunch companions had the green chili burrito and cheese enchiladas.Both were delicous and everyone was pleased with their choices.  The prices were very reasonable and the place was clean. The staff are very accomdating and friendly.  I highly recommend Bario Cafe if you are in the area.",

But in others it was close to a mix between Spanish, Italian, South American, Central American, with a Phoenician twist.  For example, instead of chips they served bread with an olive based spread -- no salsa.  At first I was disappointed, but that quickly dissipated as I dived into the bread and olive spread.  I forgot all about the bread and spread when the enchiladas -- a must have if you visit.  By the way, spend the extra few bucks and get the house margarita.  Service here was great and so was the food.  The only thing that felt off was the fact that the owner does not separate her activism from her restaurant.  To be clear, I am completely supportive of people expressing their ideas and political agendas, but sometimes I'd like to be a neutral environment while I enjoy a great meal and wonderful drinks.",

My daughter ordered the tacos, they were also gross, how you screw up a taco, I do not know!!?? Paid $57 dollars for food we just couldn't stomach.

I was motivated to try this restaurant by their support of federal workers not being paid, I figured, since they are supporting the unpaid workers, I can support the restaurant. It was soooooooo worth it! We arrived around 4:45 and realized it was happy hour, so ordered margaritas and tacos from the happy hour menu. I absolutely loved the shrimp taco and halibut taco! I requested some modicmfications to my margarita and it was perfection! Had the perfect amount of spice that I was looking for, and they trimmed the glass with Chile powder which was the icing on the cake.   Since we had tacos as an \"appetizer\", we decided to share a meal. We order the chicken enchilada suizas and they brought it out already split on 2 plates so we didn't have to do the messy work. That was an extra special touch! The enchiladas were so delicious I wanted to lick my plate to lap up the rest of the sauce (I didn't do it, but I wanted to) . I would highly recommend!

I got the pollo en mole and it was amazing! It came with three small corn tortillas and some SCRUMPTIOUS potatoes. The potatoes were my favorite part and seemed to come with everyone's dishes.   The guacamole is made fresh (not at the table unfortunately) but came with pomegranate as well. The pomegranate was surprising, but I loved it! There is also complimentary bread with a yummy paste that tasted like olives and onions and some other stuff.   We came in on their 16th anniversary so margs were $1.60. We couldn't believe our ears, but they were really only $1.60!! Happy hour prices seemed really good too.   Don't miss out on this place!",

Prices: reasonable, taco combo and some Micheladas will run you about $20.  Parking: there is a parking lot behind the building, near the rear entrance.  People: fun for all ages.  Perks: I like this place because of the artwork, both inside and out. This is a great place for a girls night out, not for bros that are starvin' Marvin. I didn't find the tacos to be as flavorful as other spots I've been to in Phoenix, but maybe I came at a bad time.",

    "text": "This place is worth a visit for the experience and traditional flavors. But be aware. This place is very pricy and know what you get and don't get with your meal and the heat level beforehand .   The location is unique but you will know when you arrive with all the \"Barrio\" graffiti on the exterior walls.  Very very cool stuff!  The inside is 2 sections of seating with some artwork on the walls.    The staff a super upbeat and friendly.  The food is definitely very good and though they have \"Mexican Traditional\" flavors. It's not a typical dish with the \"included\" as you get in other places.  For example :  enchiladas only will be served, no rice no beans.  They did serve that dish with a side of vegetables. I personally found that to be a waste of food, just did not compliment the enchilada dish at all.   But the mole was DELICIOUS.  4 small cheese enchiladas for $22.  If I was not from out of town. I would only visit once due to pricing.  We ordered the Horchata which was cleverly served in a Coca Cola bottle.  Horchata is homemade and equally delicious.   They offer table side guacamole good but it lacked the True guacamole experience as it was chopped avocado not mashed so it's an ehhh.   One gripe was the elote its description on the menu sounded delicious. BUT. You could not enjoy it as it was OVERLY spicy.  I don't mind a good kick. But this I found was a waste of money as we could not enjoy it or finish it. For 11$ hugs disappointment!",

My duck entree as ok but not worth the price. My favorite things were the agua de horchata and agua de Jamaica and mashed potatoes. It was all just so strange for a hip Mexican restaurant.",

Well I've been to the one in old Scottsdale and in Gilbert and neither live up to he hype of the original, which after eating at today I will go nowhere else for median food. The guacamole is fresh and he perfect combo of ingredients, again in a league of its own compared to the other restaurants around the valley linked to Barrio.  I ordered the Chiles en nogada as that's the signature item and the dish made on DDD. Is didn't disappoint and I will definitely order again.  It was also happy hour here on a Saturday with half off drinks and buck-fifty tacos. The tacos alone are worth coming for.   They don't have beans, rice, or flour tortillas... So if you're looking for cheap filler foods go somewhere else.  This place was amazing.",

The portion was just right and every forkful was a treat. The restaurant itself is mostly white with artist paintings hanging from the wall, but the outside is colorfully painted and a treat all by itself. The wait staff is great, friendly, cheerful and seem to be having a great time waiting/assisting the eager customers.  Looking around at what the other patrons were having made one want to stay and try a great number of dishes, everything looked like you wanted to go over and say, \"Excuse me, can I have a bite of that ?\". And there was no waiting for food, although the place as about 3/4 full, the order arrived within 10 minutes, barely enough time to sip a Margarita. So, as you can tell, I loved the place, and will return.",

My drink was eh good? His tasted like pure tequila. I mean it was top shelf but still.. He wanted a mixed drink not shots of tequila.   Their complimentary bread and salsa was odd to me. I kept an open mind and dived in. Just wrong.. The salsa had an extremely unique taste. Honestly it shouldn't even be considered salsa. We ordered they infamous guacamole, BLAND. I'll just stop there with the apps.   I ordered their camaron tacos w/ a side of spicy papas. Pretty tasty. But nothing life changing.   The atmosphere.. Where to start. They had a band? that night which had the volume on waaaay to high. The gentlemen sitting at the table behind us was literally yelling at the top of his lungs to converse with his company. It was ridiculous. Our waitress even rolled her eyes towards the direction of the music and made a comment which of course I couldn't hear over the noise.   We skipped dessert.. Unfortunately. Due mainly to the fact that during our entire meal we were waited on by our waitress maybe twice. Once when we ordered and second to drop off the check. Pathetic. If it wasn't for her 20% gratuity that they so gracious added on themselves, she would have received close to nothing for a tip.   And that concludes my Barrio Cafe review. I really looked forward to dining here but that was the first and last time I will be visiting this restaurant.",

We got there at 4:30 on a Saturday trying to beat the dinner rush since the place is so small and parking is limited and it worked out perfectly. Service was fast and our waiter made sure to get all our drink orders in before happy hour. My husband is super picky about pork dishes, since he smokes his own and he truly loved the Conchinita Pibil, they give you a ton of pork and it's so well seasoned and full of flavor. I had the Enchiladas Del Mar which was EXACTLY what I've been looking for, best version I've had in the valley! Actually had real crab meat instead of imitation, large shrimp and baby scallops. And it was drowning in cheese, my kind of situation.  for desert we had the the Pastel de Chocolate, and it was goooood. Comes out warm and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and has a subtle cinnamon and almond taste. Overall, does seem just a little bit overpriced, and our margaritas for the size could have been stronger (but we also got 2 for 1 so can't complain too much) but we will be back and might be one of my favorite restaurants now!",

Conversations over you, etc. You might as well elect them as the spokesperson and order/request things through this person. Terrible! From the moment we walked in until we got our check.

    "text": "I'll admit that my expectations for this place were probably higher than they should have been.  A James Beard Award winning chef serving food at reasonable prices?!? Who would've guessed it?  And I love mexican food, so this seemed like a win-win for me.  I'd been talking with my girlfriend about going to this restaurant since we moved to Phoenix.  To start off with, I love the character of the place.  So many restaurants in Phoenix/Scottsdale try way too hard with the modern trendy look, so its nice to have some character.  The drinks were good and reasonably priced.  The horchata texture was a little different (being grainier than I'm used to), but still good.  My girlfriend's margarita was pretty tasty, but nothing special.  I didn't try their guacamole which I regret, because when I saw them making it table-side it looked delicious.    Considering everything I heard about this place, I was a little disappointed when the food ended up just being pretty good.  I love a good mole sauce, and our server really talked it up.  Unfortunately, when the food arrived the mole sauce was okay and the chicken was dry.  My girlfriend's cochinita pibil was quite a bit tastier than my pollo en mole.  The portion sizes are large, and it'll definitely fill you up.  I'm willing to give this place another shot since you don't win a James Beard award for just decent food.  Next time I'll probably try the chilies en nogada since it's the \"iconic dish\", and just see if I didn't visit on an off night.",

We were created by a friendly hostess, we put our name in for a table and while we waited we were able to enjoy a refreshing beverage from the bar. They had a large selection of tequila and a few specialty drinks. For our appetizer we had the table-side guacamole- they had a nice twist by adding in pomegranate seeds. I was hesitant, but I am now definitely a believer! I had the beer-battered shrimp tacos, an enormous shrimp on a corn tortilla  it was amazing and the flavor of the beer really pulled through and complimented the flavors. I ordered the spicy fries as opposed to a salad to go with it. The fries came with a chipotle ketchup and were amazing! My dad and husband stole them to finish off and that's all they could talk about all night.",

The enchiladas were quite plain, low on flavor, as they simply had sliced chicken breast inside and melted cheese on top. A  lack luster experience considering the $60 tab (that included one margarita...) We were a bit disappointed. Service was very attentive and friendly.

    "text": "Barrio Cafe is a great up-scale Mexican restaurant in the heart of downtown Phoenix!   Since 2002, Phoenicians (local Phoenix residents) and tourists have been flocking to Barrio Cafe to check out Wendy Gruber and Silvana S. Esparza's amazing concoctions! Cooking up authentic southern Mexican cuisine, Barrio Cafe is worth checking out if you are visiting Phoenix!  [devour] *BREAD & OLIVE TAPENADE (complimentary, **3 STARS**) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-caf%C3%A9-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#hotQFFC1GATHL5k4SK9RlA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/barr...</a> I love toasted bread and I found it interesting that there was a type of olive tapenade accompanied with this in a Mexican restaurant. I must say though, I like the concept, but I wasn't sure how it fits in with the Barrio Cafe theme and authenticity of Mexican cuisine. The olives were rich in sodium, so I needed to drink water to dilute the saltiness. Nonetheless, it was out-of-the-box, interesting, but nothing too memorable for me.  *GUACAMOLE CASERO & CHIPS ($10.50, **5 STARS**) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-caf%C3%A9-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#MeFFk_MnYU7HeBUO3kpXYg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/barr...</a> I've fallen in love with their guacamole! I'm a guacamole slut and love everything about this dish! First and foremost, who puts pomegranate seeds in their guac?! They do! This gave a bit of sweetness, which complimented the acid from your typical guacamole ingredients. Prepared table side and made in a jiffy! I was impressed with this dish and would order it again!   *COCHINITA PIBIL ($19, **5 STARS**) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-caf%C3%A9-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#3TUF75Ror8SVevRy-CoaNA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/barr...</a> This dish is their FAMOUS 12-hour slow roasted pork marinated with achiote rojo (Mexican spices)! As you can imagine, the pork was quite succulent and there was a side of au jus in case you wanted more \"oomph\". The pork was topped off with salsa Yucateca, which elevated the flavors of the pork's richness! The dish was served with sauteed veggies and a sweet potato mash. It is a heavy dish to consume, but nonetheless, amazing dish that is taste-bud worthy! I can see why this is the popular dish amongst the visitors and regulars! Get it if you can!!! *oink*oink*    *CARNE ASADA TACOS ($14) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-caf%C3%A9-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#3NI_va9ekIdN_V8MzGYahw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/barr...</a> *FILETE AZUL (Filet Mignon) ($26) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-caf%C3%A9-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#lsSphM27AH9f18-2r00T7A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/barr...</a> -I can't attest to the other two dishes since I did not try my fellow grubbers' dishes. But both were content with the dishes they had ordered that evening.   [imbibe] *HORCHATA <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-caf%C3%A9-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#wACvkrnyMEzHvYvvJh1iAA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/barr...</a>  Barrio Cafe was honored a couple years ago for having the most authentic horchata in town. As I had a glass of it (served in a glass Coke bottle), I was expecting the drink to be over-ly sugared! Surprisingly, it was quite tamed and it was refreshing to drink throughout my dinner here.   FYI = *No reservations - it's a first come, first serve kinda place (so expect to wait) *Closed on Mondays! *Parking on the street or nearby neighborhood lots *Nearby a random strip mall *Brunch served on Sundays only (11 AM - 3 PM) *HH Tuesdays - Fridays (3-5 PM) *They carry 250 types of TEQUILA!!!! *The restaurant's walls has plaques and awards for their food and service over the years! *If you love their food, you can find their 2nd location at PHX Sky Harbor Restaurant for their food to-go!    Service - our hostess was quite busy, she forgot to let us know how long we would have to wait to be seated. We didn't really have to wait too long (15 mins) and she apologized for the delay. Our waiter was quite attentive and was able to answer any of the questions we had about the menu. Our water glasses were filled promptly and although the restaurant was quite busy, they didn't forget anything we had requested! Thank you for your service!  Overall, I had a great experience with the Barrio Cafe and would recommend this place to someone if they are looking for an upscale kinda Mexican restaurant. I wouldn't mind coming back for their guacamole, since they put a twist to the original dish!   Yelp 2013 100 for 100 Challenge - Review #25",

    "text": "Let me preface this review with a disclaimer.  This is NOT 'normal' Mexican food.  If you want tacos, beans, rice, chips and salsa, go elsewhere.  If you want cheap, go elsewhere.  If you want 'authentic' Sonoran Mexican food, go elsewhere.  But...  If you want a very flavorful food experience that has a Mexican 'foundation' in a unique and trendy environment, and you're willing to spend a few extra bucks, I think you would enjoy this place.  OK, that said, here is my [Gringo] review...  Wow.  Went here for a late lunch on a Thursday.  I had the black mole chicken enchiladas.  Others had the seafood enchiladas and enchiladas suizas.  All three dishes were excellent.  We also had the chocolate cake on ice cream with strawberries for dessert.  It was wonderful. I must admit, the table next to us had the churros, which looked even better!   I am a sauce person.  I rate Mexican restaurants by the flavor of the sauces.  On that basis, I can wholeheartedly give the Barrio Cafe 5 stars.  Interestingly, the complimentary starter dish presented was not chips and salsa, but rather bread and tapenade, which was a nice departure.  The tapenade was yummy, although I am also a big fan of fresh chips and house salsa (again, if it has a good flavor and constitution!).    On top of the fine food, the restaurant is decorated wonderfully with El Dia de los Muertos artwork.  Even the restroom is a kick.  Their 'throne room' is a True shrine! LOL.  I loved it!  I  will definitely go back when we are in Phoenix and recommend you give it a try.  I understand it gets quite busy at times, so I can recommend a Thursday at 2:00pm as a great time to stop by for a late lunch and avoid the crowds.  Salud!",

    "text": "Full review blogged.  High points below:  A native of a small town in the Midwest surrounded by farms heavily populated by Latino workers each summer of my youth I'm a bit ashamed to admit that overall my experience with \"Mexican\" food in general has been quite abysmal.  Sure there were childhood experiences with Little Mexico in Detroit before or after games at Joe Louis Arena and yes I've visited a few of Rick Bayless' spots in the Second City but beyond that and Border Grill in Los Angeles the closest I've been to South of the Border cuisine is Don Pablos...or perhaps Chi-Chi's before they filed for bankruptcy.  With these glaring omissions in my culinary education admitted and in part due to my overall lack of enthusiasm for spicy foods I promised myself going into this trip to Arizona that I would make an effort to at least hit some of the more upscale spots in order to \"ease myself in\" and the first of these stops would be at The Barrio Cafe.  Going light on the bread as it was somewhat uninspiring and the plates coming from the kitchen were surprisingly large it would be around twenty minutes after seating that my \"appetizer\" would arrive in the form of Tacos de Cochinita Pibil, four Mayan style slow roasted suckling pig tacos wrapped in house made tortillas with a side of Yucca fries, chipotle ketchup, and salsa Yucateca.  Beginning first with the tacos I'll simply say that while it may not mean much considering my lack of experience these were without a doubt the best tacos I have ever had.  Double wrapped due to the moistness of the succulent meat each bite was savory and smoky with a light acidity kissing the tongue as the queso fresco tamed everything.  Deftly spiced with any number of flavors foreign to my palate and going back and forth with the tasty fries I think the thing that really stood out to me with this dish was that while the \"heat\" was there, it served a purpose - pushing forward more unique tones like cinnamon, nutmeg, cumin, and even sweetness from the meat.  For my main course; a dish titled Pato en Tamarindo or \"Seared breast of duck in a striking sweet & sour tamarind & chipotle pepper sauce.\"  With my love of duck well documented and already quite impressed with the flavor profile of the preceding tacos I have to say I went into this dish with high expectations and was met only half-way.  Beginning first with the accoutrements - mashed yucca with poblano peppers and asparagus with onions, both were tasty and well prepared if not particularly memorable.  Moving on to the duck, similarly well prepared with the breast first pounded thin and then sauteed prior to a final sear, the issue with this dish would flash back to my complaint about \"spice\" because while the menu said \"duck\" my palate merely said \"protein\" as the flavors of the fowl were entirely obliterated by the thick notes of smoke, pepper, and slight bitters.  A good dish, sure, but for someone who truly loves duck I simply wanted to be able to taste it.  With the duck now consumed and feeling reasonably full but certainly not \"stuffed\" Esequiel again stopped by with a big smile stating \"Nice job, I knew you could do it.  But did you save room for dessert?\" - an obvious 'yes' which led to perhaps Barrio Cafe's most famous dish arriving at my table just ten minutes later.  Entitled \"Churros Rellenos de Cajeta de Cabra\" and trumping either of the previous dishes in overall mass this marvelous plate was composed of essentially five things and all five of them things I love; deep fried cinnamon doughnuts, chocolate, caramel, strawberries, and ice cream.  Beginning first with the Churros - flawless, light, and crisp on the exterior with molten goats milk caramel spilling forth as they were cut...in all honestly they could have stopped here and I'd have been happy, but instead opting to pair this with an enormous double scoop of fresh vanilla bean ice cream drizzled with more caramel, slightly peppery \"Mexican hot chocolate\" and fresh strawberries...sure it was $12 for churros, but it is $12 I'd gladly spend again as I ate every last bite of the crunchy yet creamy concoction and spent another three or four minutes scraping the plate clean with my spoon.  With Esequiel returning yet again and asking, jokingly, if I'd enjoyed the churros he inquired (I hope jokingly) if there was anything else he could get me and telling him no, that the bill, I waited for a few moments while my tab was calculated - an admittedly pricey $58 after tax and tip - and with the bill paid I thanked the my servers for such a great afternoon before making my way back out into the sun.  Thankful for the meal that just was for opening my eyes in to a cuisine I've far too long overlooked I've no doubt that Barrio Cafe is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the Valley's Mexican scene, but considering what they say about first impression's I'm glad Chef Esparza and her team made a good one.",

Let's do dinner!\" Given my Northeastern-ness and general geographical warp of the rest of the United States, I assumed it was a \"quick jaunt.\" After correcting me and mentioning the 115 mile drive, my friend mentioned that she had few ideas, but had heard of this terrific upscale Mexican place called Barrio Cafe. Turns out it was worth the lead!  Barrio Cafe has an interesting menu presenting thoughtfully prepared Mexican dishes with flair. I really enjoyed the tableside guacamole preparation (which included pomegranate seeds, which I hadn't seen in guac before), and their extensive tequila and margarita menu was great. I had a delicious chicken in black mole dish which was awesome. The mole sauce was flavorful and rich, and the consideration of flavor profiles and the way colors played on the plate was impressive. This is no taco joint! The price point is a bit higher than average for Mexican food in Phoenix, but offers a more sophisticated and elegant range of choices if you're looking for something slightly upscale.  The staff was friendly and accommodating and the spare, but colorfully decorated dining room was pleasant. By the time we exited, the restaurant was packed and I can see why. Another great find in Phoenix, and recommended if you're in the area looking for a leisurely, tasteful dining experience.",

The place is very nicely decorated, the bar has a big variety of tequilas and the music is spot on. The appetizer had a very nice taste , not too salty, just right for a tapenade. We ordered the famous guacamole, which was also different from what you normally see, but to my taste it had too much lime juice, which made it a bit sour.  I ordered the horchata and it came in a coca cola bottle, which was unique and very good! i also decided to try enchiladas suizas, my husband had the pozole and my mother the chile en nogada The enchiladas to my taste were not that great, dry and the chicken came in huge chunks and also very dry. Un seasoned vegetables and no hint of tomatillo.  The chile en nogada was the best of the three, nice flavor and good presentation.  My husband honestly did not like the pozole, he thought it was salty, and he found pomegranate in it, which was too much.  The best thing of our meal was the service, excellent customer service!",

Also, the bloody Mary was very tasty, so much so, my better half didn't even know it was made with tequila.  We will be back to try the dinner menu, hopefully sooner rather than later.",

I think my wife and I had expectations that this place was going to serve typical \"barrio/authentic mexican\" food, frijoles, arroz, etc.  What we received, was what we ended up calling \"Retro Mexican\" or food that one would find in a posh, trendy, upscale yuppie neighborhood. I about spit out my iced tea when one of the other customers asked for \"Mexican Wine Juice\".... WTF!   I looked at my wife and was like what is \"Mexican Wine Juice\"?  Its called Sangria you DA.  Don't get me wrong, it is good to see that the ghente running this place are doing well, but it just wasn't what I expected.  The area was nowhere near sketchy like one of the previous reviewers posted, but then again if you are used to or are from Beverly Hills CA, Cherry Creek CO, Scottsdale AZ or any posh area it might be for you.  As for the food.  I had the Torta de Filetito.  The filet was cooked perfect but the spices were lacking something, Some spicey chile maybe?!  The iced tea was good, and the steak fries dipping sauce was different. Kind of like a lazy attempt at spicing up the ketchup.  The portion size was enormous and was a bit pricey.   The good thing is, is that price evened out to two meals had I gone and bought dinner that night.  The waitstaff was awesome and on-point.  As one of the reviewers below stated this place gets stars for all the little things murals, waiters, artwork, etc. but the food is definetly not reflective of the \"Barrio\".",

You have to park in the back, which is fun as you get to appreciate the festive well done graffiti on the building.   I had a small table to myself and was shortly brought some airy bread with a pimento salsa/marinara that was pretty good although I'm no a huge fan of green olives.  I ordered the pork tacos with side salad, loved the cranberries on the salad as well as the balsamic vinaigrette.  The tacos were super messy, dropping greatness, but so good but what really added to it was a squeeze of lime and the salsa verde. It was a perfect meal that kept me well after my hike three hours later.",

The host, Guy, seemed pretty smitten with this place, and I can't say I blame him.  The outside of the restaurant is covered with awesome graffiti style art, literary on all sides. The inside has a hip vibe to it and is broken into several small rooms with tables. We were seated right away on Saturday at lunch over a holiday weekend. Our server was with us quickly and was very nice and accommodating. He had no problem pointing out the couple things on the menu I should avoid, to stay away from da glutzen, but mostly everything else was gluten free.   We ordered the guacamole which was amazing and the unexpected pomegranate seeds added a nice sweet yet tangy component. I had seen a couple of their especialidades de casa featured on the show and it was the tilapia that made me decide that this place needed to make the top of my nom list. The Mojarra San Augustin was amazing. A piece of seasoned tilapia on a bed of the family recipe achiote and wrapped in a banana leaf. It was perfect. My friend had the spinach salad with pecans and golden raisins. She loved the spicy yet sweet dressing but wished she'd had more options as a vegetarian. I'm not sure what my other friends ordered, they are regulars here and love it.  Overall, wish I was still in the Phoenix area so I could explore this menu more. It has a great atmosphere, food quality is excellent, price is reasonable and service was good. Definitely recommend trying it out, Guy wouldn't steer ya wrong.",

I am going to keep this review a little shorter than most of mine... because, well, there are 981 other reviews that this is similar to.  I started out with the Chata, a delectable combination of Agua de Horchata, Crema 1921 Tequila and Kahlua.  Yum... and very strong!  If there was more room in the front bar area and some better music to dance to, then you can be sure I'd have been cuttin' a rug after that drink.  The drink is highly recommended.  Hanging out in the overly crowded bar area is not so highly recommended... but it's what you expect at a popular ristorante like Barrio Cafe.  I was seated shortly thereafter... and ordered the Cochinita Pibil.  Cochinita Pibil is a house special -- pork marinated in achiote and sour orange, wrapped in a banana leaf and slow roasted over night, topped with pickled red onion and Yucatan-style pico de gallo.  !Excelente!  I was not wowed with the service that night... but otherwise, it was a wonderful meal.    **** 4.5 STARS ****",

I got out of the factory early today, so I blew a run to Barrio.  The place was packed, so I ordered takeout.  I got the Chile's en Nogada and the Suizas.  The waiter told me that they would travel well (which was good, because I had a 20 minute drive back to Chandler).  Well, I can tell you this was right up there with the best \"food\" I've ever had.  I hesitate to call it Mexican simply because the ingredients trend to that region.  I loved the Chiles, I would be money that the suizas will be better than most, even reheated!",

No problem, we ordered a house margarita ($9) and there award winning Horchata ($5.5) which was served in a Mexican Coke bottle with a glass of ice.  Let me tell you this is the way to enjoy Horchata!!  No watered down drink and you actually get a few servings because you get a full bottle.  It was the best Horchata I've ever had and would go back just to drink it again :-)  We ordered the Equites as an appetizer to start us out!! Wow we should of ordered (2). It was so delicious.   I went simple for the meal, Carne Asada Tacos served with a choice of side salad or french fries, I went with the salad and it was so yummy.  The salad was awesome, with the mixture of of with the fruit, cheese, and spicy peppers.  The tacos were delicious but I think the stand outs for this meal were the Horchata and the Equites we had before the main course.

Other than that, the food was average to good, and the restaurant itself was very quaint.  For parking, there is some parking in the back and there is a lot of street parking. Once parked, there is a front entrance located on the main road and there is an entrance in the back, entering from the parking lot. The host/hostess is in the front so you'd have to go there to get seated. The restaurant itself has a nice authentic ambiance to it and has an interesting layout. It has several different rooms with seating so it's not an \"open concept.\" It's not a problem. I actually like it but just pointing it out.  Anyway, once we were seated, our service was very absent and slow. It took a while for our waitress to do everything from bringing over menus, water, our food, etc...Her presence was lacking. For the prices we were paying for food, I had expected better service. Speaking of pricing, it was slightly pricey but the food was good. It wasn't the best I've had but I liked that my food wasn't overly greasy. It was tasty and had a good portion.",

While I didn't think they were worth the price, they were very good for the time I took the travel there.   The big WOW for me was the dessert my friend talked me into. They were two long churros with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream and cut up strawberries and perhaps some hazelnut? The presentation was gorgeous. Overall, it was a delicious choice to run with and well worth the price.   I probably won't come back to this joint but for some reason, I chose to bookmark it as a place to try in Phoenix. Can't for the life of me remember why......",

The menu had so much to choose from asada to seafood. However i must point out...This is the first time at a mexican food that served complimentary bread with rustic tomato tapenade . Quite delish!!!! Albeit the bread could've been warm or better yet HOT. By the time my dish came, i was full of bread and my gut just imploded.  My del mar enchilada was good but too much cream sauce that it drowned my enchiladas. I used the bread to sop up  some of the sauce.  Service was spotty. One main server for our room with busser but the drink server was johnny on the spot.  your glass was never half empty. He forgot my grand son's order and could'nt find him to bring more tortillas for our meal.  PRO: friendly server, mass amount of fresh food, the bread with tapenade!!!!!!! CON: loud, cramp, need more server",

    "text": "If you're expecting nachos, cheap tacos, rice and beans, a chimichanga drenched in sour cream then you can stop right there! Barrio Cafe is so much more than than that. You can expect to taste some of the best and TRUE traditional flavors from Mexico with a twist of Chef Silvana's special touches.   The service at the restaurant is always phenomenal. YES there can be long waits depending when you go during the week. YES the prices are higher than your typical Mexican food spot. Trust me when I tell you it'll all be worth it. Also in my opinion I like eating at a Mexican restaurant that plays Mexican music such as Ramon Ayala at their establishment. So bonus points to Barrio Cafe for doing that.   Each time I come I like to try something new on the menu because honestly I have yet to order anything that is bad. So far the enchiladas suizas, cochinita, and the Granada are my favorite! DON'T LIMIT YOURSELF TO JUST TACOS.   When you come here it's much more than just the food. You'll get exposed to the local street art by famous artists such as Lalo Cota or El Mac. The chef is also heavily involved in her community and once in a while you'll see Lowriders pull up for food & toy drives.   Barrio Cafe is hands down my number 1 restaurant in Phoenix and I hope Barrio is here to stay forever because I plan on bringing my kids and their kids in the future generations to come.",

    "text": "Celebrating a dear friend's birthday and she suggested this spot. It took me a long time to come here but I'm glad I did! This place is SO cute, the art lover in me appreciated it. The parking isn't huge but there were quite a few spots open when I arrived. The entrance is pretty nondescript (see photo) but I liked the understated effect it had.   There are beautiful murals in the parking lot on the walls, really cool stuff. The bathroom is tiny but I loved it, find it as soon as you enter to the left. Our complimentary bread and olive tapenade came out quickly as did our waters (which were refilled often). My friend and I decided to split our dishes, which I'm glad for because they were big portions. We started with the esquites, which was corn topped with all sorts of yummy things and had good heat to it, really tasty. We stayed vegetarian and shared the calabacitas entree, another winner. Loved the rolled corn tortillas, the squash, and the scrumptious mashed potatoes on the side. This place does an excellent job blending flavors and creating truly unique dishes.   We HAD to get dessert, so we got the churros with vanilla ice cream, goat milk syrup, caramel, pecans, and strawberries. Such a tasty treat! I loved how the fruit broke up the sugary components but overall it was light and not super sweet.   We really enjoyed the food and atmosphere here. It did get loud because of a large party next to us, but it wasn't unbearable. The only thing that could be improved was our server. He seemed distracted and not quite focused on us; rather than asking us if we were ready to order, he would glance at our table from a distance so I had to flag him down. Other than that, loved this place and would like to come back.",

    "text": "Landed in Phoenix on a trip with my son to Sedona but made this our first stop for Lunch before our 2 hour drive.  All I can say is WOW!    Coming from the east coast and being with my 11 year old son we asked for 1) nachos - \"we don't serve nachos here\" 2) rice and beans - \"we don't serve beans here\". \"Sir, we only serve authentic Southern Mexican cuisine\". I thought, that's good for me but will my 11 year old eat anything.   Ok so we started with the sweet and spicy soup for my son, thinking I will be finishing it myself.  Holy molly, it was amazing.  My son couldn't get enough of it.  Never tasted anything like it.  But it was way too large of a portion so he only ate about half and I had a few spoons knowing that my food will be coming out too.  Then he had small cheese based tacos.  Again he had a taste party in his mouth.  Loved it, and, when I tried one, I can see why. Purely simple fresh and amazing combination of flavors.   For me I had to have the chicken mole since this was authentic Mexican food.  I ordered chicken with both dark and red mole.  This was amazing.  The complexity of flavors and level of spice (although I could have used a bit more spice) were very unique to this place and extremely enjoyable.  The darker Mole being a bit more bitter by nature and the red being a bit more sweet made the dish delicious.    The starting complimentary bread which is baked for this place was dangerously fresh.  Had to have a lot of will power to stop From finishing the entire dish.    I don't know much about this neighborhood but the art in the restaurant and the murals on the exterior are worth visiting on their own too.  Very fresh colors and local story telling via these murals.  I am Sure people stop by just to snap some Shots. But those who are not walking in for a meal are missing out on something very special!!",

Time to find a place to eat.  We love Triple D locations and this popped up in my search.  Atmosphere - The place is small and looks like they took over a couple spots in the multi-use building.  The place looks very formal with the table clothes, but I felt comfortable in my t-shirt and jeans.  Food   Drinks - Just water has I am driving to Las Vegas after lunch, and I have had very little sleep after the wedding the previous day.  I did have to visit the bar to look at the impressive tequila collection.  Probably one of the best ones I have seen in a restaurant.    Appetizer - Free bread with a tapenade.    Lunch - I have just recently discovered the torta, and they had a section on the menu.  Torta is a sandwich, which I have would say are on thick small loaf.  The Cochinita Pibil did not let me down.  The pork had a little sourness to it, which went well with the pico de gallo   I cut my sandwich in half to make easier to eat.  The second half turned into an open face sandwich as the sauce destroyed the bread.  Service - Our waiter was super friendly and rest of the staff was great.  Future - I wish I could make this a regular place but since I am on vacation I do not see making it back anytime soon.",

    "text": "Extreme flavors, in a bad way. I'd consider myself an adventurous eater, and I usually trust friends' suggestions if they have visited before. In fact I let my friends recommend me something or I just order the exact same dish they picked for themselves. Well my dinner companion judged me wrong and suggested Barrio's mole enchiladas, which was described as a \"smooth chocolately flavor\". It was a bad sign when I noticed they did not order something comparable for themselves! Pollo en Mole Spice rubbed, pan seared chicken breast topped with a bold and flavorful Mole de Oaxaca (black or red)  Good gravy, that stuff tasted terrible and BITTER! I looked up whether this was typical after the fact and it suggests that the chili used for the sauce was burnt. I've tried enchiladas before with pleasure and it was like the thick, black mole sauce (resembling more of balsamic vinegar but much thicker consistency) drowned and ruined the enchiladas. I subconsciously tried scraping the sauce off while eating it. The server told me that half of the ones I ordered was \"spicy\" and the others were mild. They both tasted equally bitter. I paid around ~$23+ for the dish and I hate wasting food so I even dragged that thing back home with me. I didn't even want to look at it once it went in the fridge.  Now onto the their table side guacamole. We ordered 2 servings and you can customize based on your table what you want in there. The preparer added WAY too much LEMON. That was the only portion I could taste aside from the texture of the pomegranate seeds also tart. Also their tortilla chips are oily and have no taste on their own. As for the desserts, we ordered the Churros Rellenos de Cajeta de Cabralogs (basically 2 long churro logs drenched in caramel) and Crepas de Cajeta (more floppy carbs dunked in caramel).  The server and staff were fine and took a photo for our group. The main waiter forgot to go back and give me a bag for my sad leftovers, but a man on the way out hooked me up. The restaurant itself is an intimate small space with limited parking in the back. They have murals and artwork all along the exterior and interior walls. Next time if I visit I'll try milder menu items and definitely avoid their Mole.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite spots for no frills amazingly prepared food from the Mexican heartland.  You really can't go wrong with most of the menu. The guacamole is classic in how it showcases the  avocado with a fun twist of pomegranate seeds.  The Queso Fundito is gloppy and tasty with earthy mushrooms and spicy chorizo to cut through the cheese.  The Esquites is everything that you want in street corn in an easier to eat format.  You need to try the Cochinita Pibil in some form.  It's the most amazing Pork slow roasted with sour oranges in banana leaves.  Wow. Is it tasty.  This time I had the Mole Enchiladas with Chicken.  Dark and earthy and complex ..... it's what Mole should taste like.    The Flan and Tres Leches are exactly how they should each taste, but the Crepes with Cajeta are out of this world.  The goat milk caramel is simply amazing.  I could eat quarts of it.   The Margaritas as expected are great but for a treat try a Paloma with Mezcal, Smokey and Limey and Grapefruity goodness.",

We came rather early around 5:30pm and parked in a spot behind Barrio.  We ordered the tableside guacamole and chiles en nogadas. Loved the tableside preparation of the guac - super fresh and delicious, especially with the addition of pomegranate seeds. First time trying chiles en nogadas for both of us and it was super delicious! Portion is pretty generous and I'm glad we shared it because the sauce and filling were pretty rich. Great combination of sweet and savory and very yummy.  Service was super friendly and quick. You also get complimentary bread and a type of olive tapenade while you wait. The host, whose name I didn't catch, was so great! Super friendly and just made our meal here a great experience.",

    "text": "After having the sincere pleasure of dining here for over a decade, I still look back to the week when it first opened.  I just happened to be at the office complex across the street visiting a friend, and I decided to find out what all the hype was about. This place made a big splash in the valley, and was the talk of the town.  I discovered the dishes were inventive, unique, and absolutely sublime.  Over a decade later, their superb quality, iconic dishes, and Mole that is off the charts is a continual reminder that Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza hasn't missed a beat in all this time.  There aren't enough superlatives to describe the enlivening flavors that erupt in your mouth. The chicken, meat, and pork are always delightfully tender.  The accompanying sauces are vastly superior to any other regional restaurants out there.   There's all this, and I haven't even told you about the flan yet.  If you're a flan lover like me, and visit as many places as we do, then you could possibly agree that there are only 2-3 places in town that come close to properly preparing this dessert. Barrio Cafe is one of those places. After this mid-week date's experience, they're still the best in my humble opinion.  It's no surprise that they continue to be on national lists of restaurants to visit in the Phoenix area.",

I was shocked I hadn't reviewed it yet!  I've always had a consistent experience here and everyone I've brought along with me has loved it. I've tried all of the tacos and have never gone wrong, I really don't think you can with the menu.   As for this visit, it was completely on par with what I've come to expect. My dad ordered a lemonade which comes out in a coke bottle with a glass of ice. Nice touch. We also ordered the guacamole because... you must. It's honestly the best I've ever had. They don't prepare it table-side during lunch but it's just as good. You get a large portion and delicious chips, but try not to fill up on them.   I went with the pork tacos as they pack an amazing combo of flavors and are my favorite of the taco offerings. You get to chose spicy fries or a salad as your side. You can't go wrong either way, but I went for spicy fries this time. My dad got the Chile con queso and we swapped some to taste each other's, his was delicious as well.   I would definitely consider splitting and/or sharing meals especially if you get the guacamole. They also provide bread to every table so we had a LOT of food and took some home.   The atmosphere and service are stellar as well. This is an amazing spot by an amazing chef. This is not your run of the mill Mexican, it's in a league of its own. I highly recommend.",

    "text": "The food was just ok. The service was slightly below ok. The price was outrageous.   I ordered the pulled-pork sandwich (I'm not sure the actual name of it). It was ok flavor-wise, but did not blow me away. To me it seemed more like a $6 pulled-pork sandwich you would buy at any cafe than the $14-$18 ( not 100% sure on the price) sandwich I ordered. It came with some pico de gallo and pickled red onions on it. The barbecue sauce was served in a small dish on the side. The bread on the bottom was soggy, and my white napkin was completely covered in grease by the time I was done. The pork was tender for the most part, but I did have a few big chunks of tough meat which were the texture of beef jerky in there. The \"spicy fries\" were crispy and tasted pretty good. The quotations are there because there is no spice to them. They're more like \"seasoned fries.\"   Altogether our table ordered 4 drinks, 2 homemade lemonades and 2 horchatas. The drinks were served in giant chilled coca-cola bottles with cups filled with ice to pour them into, which at first we thought was kinda cute. Then, after drinking part of my lemonade the server had poured into the cup, I noticed a big piece of what I'm assuming was cilantro stuck to the inside of it! When I showed it to the server, all he said was ok, and grabbed it to bring me a new one. The guys who ordered the horchata did like that quite a bit, so that might be redeeming spot. They do cost $5.50/pc.   One of our plates (enchiladas moles) was so gross it was inedible to anyone at the table, so we just sent it back completely whole.   The server didn't want to apologize for any mistakes, really explain anything on the menu to us, or make any adjustments to the menu to fit anyone's personal taste.   Not one of us was overwhelmed by the flavor of our dish. Ultimately, we wound up paying $115 to be shoved into a corner and rushed, and to wind up buying our kids fast food afterwards. I'd much rather go somewhere where they value their customers more.",

If you do plan to go for your lunch hour, carpool with co-workers because parking is very limited and plan for an extended lunch because you very well might spend over an hour here. We showed up at noon, not packed at all, however, our service was very slow. The time it took our server to take our order, deliver our food and drop our check seemed way too long. The seating is uncomfortable and may be a little crowded for those with space issues.   However, the food is great! If you're one to overlook the aforementioned cons, then you will love the Barrio hands down! In lieu of chips and salsa, you will be served bread and tapenade. Try the Guacamole, made fresh upon order and is served with tostada chips. This Gauc is really good!!!!  I had the Torta de Pollo - grilled chicken breast served on a warm pannini style bread and slathered with great flavors. But wait! Don't stop there.. You have got to leave room for  Postres! OMG!!!!! The Churros Rellenos KICK!!!! These are not to be confused with the Churros you may have had at Disney Land. These Churros are served with warm caramel sauce, vanilla bean ice cream and candied walnuts. It is a crime to not have these fritters.    I struggled giving 5 stars because of the lack of parking, slow service, and uncomfortable seating. However, This will not stop me from making another trip to the Barrio.    See you there!",

Barrio is almost always packed, so be prepared to wait outside for awhile before you can get a table. My advice: order a sangria or a margarita and take it out on the patio while you wait. Once you get seated, make sure you order an appetizer. This place is famous for its guacamole, but I prefer the quesadilla de langosta borracha. Those little lobster quesadillas are messy and absolutely decadent!   For dinner, I love the enchiladas de mole, which are enchiladas smothered in a smoky, chocolate-based sauce (mole). The pato en tamarindo (duck with tamarind sauce) and the cochinita pibil (slow-roasted pork) are also amazing. My other favorite is chiles en nogada, which is a poblano pepper stuffed with chicken, spices and all sorts of fruits. It's truly unusual (in a good way), but unfortunately Barrio only offers it for part of the year (I believe it's available from Septemeber until February maybe?) Don't be afraid to try something new. I've taken lots of people to Barrio and they have all been blown away by the food.",

I ordered the Enchiladas de Hongos (mushroom enchilada) and found the dish to be overwhelmingly rich and not that flavorful (beyond cheese and cream). There was so much cheese drowning in a white creamy sauce with not enough acid or freshness to balance it out. There was a little bit of fresh pico de gallo which made the bites with it much better, but there wasn't enough for the whole dish. It was overall a very disappointing $17 dish and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. My boyfriend got the Torta Poblano and liked it fine. The bread looked good and it looked like it had a lot of sauce on it. The caramel churro dessert was quite amazing and saves this restaurant from a 2 star review by my stomach. The churro was delightfully crispy on the outside and smooth and soft on the inside, and served with very yummy caramel sauce, spiced nuts (added a nice texture), and smooth vanilla ice cream.  The inside of the restaurant is on the small side and it seemed to be getting crowded. I didn't think the interior was all that nice - a mixed match of art for sale on the walls and that's about it. I wouldn't come back here for another meal, and wouldn't recommend it to other vegetarians.",

The prices are higher than a typical Phoenix restaurant, but the food is exponentially better!  I always get something with seafood at Barrio and a margarita.  You also need to try the table-side guacamole with pomegranates.  It's great.",

Located at 16th Street and Thomas, heading into a little bit older area of town, you don't expect to find a fine dining Mexican food experience.  I was greatly surprised.  While looking at the price of the food, and coupling it with the location, I was hoping that I would not be disappointed.  I was not.  The food was excellent.  The taco's were very enjoyable, but the surprise of the meal was the heavily seasoned french fries.  I will definitely come back on a date here, and enjoy some of the traditional Mexican dinners.  The only thing that could make the Barrio Cafe a better experience is a lunch menu.  It's tough to head out for a lunch with the only option being the Taco's at a reasonable price.  I see that there are tons of choices for Tequila.  I will have to go back and test out their varieties.  Can you call me a cab??",

I would go back if one of my friends really wanted to, but it is not on the top of my list.  Bottom line....overpriced!",

I was not impressed with anything I had there- the guacamole was just okay, the margaritas were not worth $13 apiece, and I had a mango shrimp \"salad\" that consisted of just sliced  fruits on a plate with just 3 shrimp in the middle. Definitely underwhelmed by the food and drinks, and definitely not worth the money.",

This was one of the three places on the show and the standout for me.  We came here on our second night in town and was tempted to return on the third night too.  Thanks to the hotel bell-hop/valet we started with the guacamole which is made table-side (nothing new I know) but it came with pomegranate seeds.  They totally worked.  Also, the chips were round small tortillas about 4 times the size of a typical tortilla triangle.  Very tasty!  For my main meal I went with the daily special which was fillet Mignon stuffed with crab.  YUM!  Oh and before I forget, I also had the house margarita which was one of the best I have ever had and the sangria that has Jack Daniels in it.  It totally worked for me!  For dessert we ordered the vanilla crepe but the last one was given to an adjacent table so instead they brought us hot churros with yummy ice cream.  It totally hit the spot.  If I went back again I would try the slow cooked pork.  Oh and a local told me that they have a fabulous brunch too.  Go there!  It is a must in Phoenix!",

    "text": "Another review of Barrio? Yea, why not.  5 of us went tonight. They had a special Margarita with a great tequila, simple with only lime juice and triple sec or something.  Very dry and yummy ($11).  Tableside Guac is fantastic with the pomegranite seeds and also the Queso Fundido (sp?).  The Queso Fundido is a little bit of work to eat as the cheese tends to be a bit stringy.  You have to just go right for it and show no fear.  It is quite good.  I ordered the Conchinita Pibil Tacos (roasted pork) which were great.  They come with a starter salad or french fries.  I had the salad and loved it, great dried cranberries in it.  Hard to explain to people why they are having a salad or french fries at an upscale white table cloth \"mexican\" restaurant.  But it works.  My tacos do conchinita pibil (pork) were great, with a little Casera cheese (a treat).   There are 4 small tacos so I got to trade with my brother who had the fish tacos which I thought were even better than the pork.    My partner had the Enchiladas Mole (a favorite).  But in truth, I may be bored with this dish.  I thought it was a bit dry, and lacked flair.  Not sure what it is, but it just seemed flat.  Was like that the last time I went also.  I love the Mole sauce, but the enchilada itself was boring.  Oh, and the second margarita was even better than the first.  Service is cocky, maybe even strict at times, and very pleasing overall.  They know what they are doing and you can trust them.  Was a bit noisy tonight, as there isn't much sound deadening.    I honestly can't stand it when they have live music - ditch that.  If you haven't been, it is a must.  Parking:  Sucks.  Bring your friends car, park out back and don't worry about it.",

The service was efficient and pleasant, but the margarita and the food was super mediocre. I guess that the biggest reason I jumped in to comment was the $19 margarita. First, the drink was awful. Really acidic, but with almost no flavor. My husband ordered one too and immediately just stopped drinking his and ordered a beer because \"they won't be able to screw that up\". I tried to salvage mine with a floater of chamborg ($9). It was better, but $19?   $12 for a bowl of corn chowder that had one lonely and awkwardly floating shrimp in there. My husband and I both agreed that it had a familiar taste and consistency,  but couldn't put our finger on it, until I shouted \"cream of wheat\". That was it, a bowl of near tasteless gruel at almost a room temperature. We couldn't figure out if it was a hot soup or supposed to be cold and sat too long.    The queso fundido was the other app. nothing to complain about, but not great.   We both ordered tacos (because they were out of the pork dish they are known for at 6 pm). The tacos were super mediocre. Again ... three little street tacos on greased corn tortillas. I had shrimp which was tasty enough. My husband had steak. His lacked any real flavor.   The spicy fries served with the meal was the best part. Also, I thought that the chips were good and the salsa was amazing.   I am always looking for great spots and this most definitely was not it.  $100 later ... NOT impressed.",

The murals on the walls outside set the tone for your experience of great authentic Mexican food.  Having guacamole prepared tableside is a bonus.  Depending on the season, they add pomegranates or dried cranberries to the mix.  Never would have thought of that, and it's amazingly fabulous.",

We didn't go for the more typical things as we wanted to try something different. Our waiter was great at helping us make selections.   My only disappointment was that my meal was not very hot.   I had ordered the mole enchiladas and the mole was tasty but the enchiladas were not heated all the way through.    Live music was playing by the time we left - we will go a bit later next time so we can enjoy the music.",

The $28 halibut I ordered was hella overcooked, which saddened me because it's such a beautiful piece of fish and a pretty sizable portion. Also, the \"pipian\" was more of a cilantro cream sauce (good sauce, but don't call it pipian). The pozole was good, but not much different than my own - so props for a solid pozole! But also if I pay for it I want it to be better than what I can do on my own, and it didn't come with tortilla or tostada. Finally, the ambiance was great and felt really inviting, super warm and artsy and culturally relevant for this Texas chicana, but the service was meh - maybe our server was weeded? Overall, I was a little disappointed because I felt like there was so much there that was possible but the execution was a little off. Hope the management pays closer attention on other days! Lots of potential here.",

    "text": "Tried this place for the first time with a couple friends for lunch on a Sunday. Had a good experience, friendly service and our waiter made several recommendations. The live music was a bonus! I  agree with other reviews on price point; however, this is not traditional Mexican food so perhaps in that viewpoint, pricing is expected? We didn't order off the Sunday brunch menu which looked to be more affordable, but everything we did order was delicious:   Libations: The Bloody Mary was so good, not too overpowering or spicy.  The glass was rimmed with salt and what looked/tasted like sugar and crushed red pepper, not spicy at all, a nice touch.  I also tried a Michelada for the first time, another good choice! Would like to try happy hour (drinks are half off) on another visit.  Starters: The complimentary bread basket with Olive Tapenade set the tone for a non-traditional Mexican meal. But we also ordered an appetizer, the Kuali de Cameron which was my favorite. Think fancy shrimp tostadas...a large shrimp atop a roasted jalapeno dressed with a couple of different cheeses and seasoned very well! Would like to try the guacamole raved by other yelpers next time for sure!  Main event: We ordered a couple dishes for sharing, the Tacos Cochinita Pibil (pulled pork) was very tasty; the meat was juicy and flavorful. The enchiladas suizas was traditional with the exception of chorizo crumbled on top, otherwise not really too exciting for my palate.   Grand finale: After little debate and then a vote, we decided to go with the Flan for dessert. The flan itself was okay; however, the candied pecans and the fresh-cut strawberries on the side with Khalua cream and caramel heavily drizzled on top added more character to this dessert. There was also another distinct taste like goat cheese and when we asked the waiter he mentioned its cajetas (goat milk in the caramel sauce), all flavors blended nicely together to end a good meal :)",

I admit, it wasn't the best looking place in the best neighborhood, but I never did feel out of place or unsafe. The parking is in the back as the street parking is not really available. When you go around, you'll find ample parking and some nice artwork.  You can enter either through the back or front. The place was not too busy when entered, but after a short while got really hopping!  We had some beer and Michelada's to start, then was served an olive-based salad with bread, which was awesome. For dinner we had Cochinita Pibil Tortas and Filetito Torta. Both entrees were excellent, served fairly quickly.  Our service was very good, even when the place got busy.

I will admit as a disclaimer that I do have a larger than average appetite and all I ate all day beforehand was a bagel and shmear for a late breakfast.

    "text": "Any meal at Barrio Cafe is a treat. Just driving by the building is an eyeful of what has to be the best artwork covered building in Phoenix. Every inch of the endless mural deserves to be observed, studied and remembered. Feel it people. If you go in through the back door, where the parking lot brings you, you enter a portal that takes you to a neighborhood place, where everything and everyone is familiar. You've been here before. It's like coming home. Only better, because you don't have to cook. I don't care what you order, it's good. It's better than good. It's the exact way it should be.  From the tapenade and bread to the pomegranate guacamole all the way to the crepes de cajeta, everything was perfect.  We ordered a side of spicy steak fries because they made a nice share plate and they're great with the spicy ketchup. And I love french fries.  For my main dish, I had the Enchiladas del Mar. It turned out to be a little too much cheese for me, but the rest of my family loved it. (Me & dairy... eh) But it had the right amount of flavor and sea food to balance out the cheese. And it came with the perfect side - sauteed vegetables. A nice combination. So in the fairness of sharing, I had a Carne Asada taco. The tortilla was just crispy enough to not be floppy and it held the grilled steak the way a tortilla should. Until I was done eating it. Since it was happy hour I indulged in a Barrio Bomba Margarita and was delighted at how pretty (and how big) it was. I know it was mostly juice in that tumbler, but how could I go wrong with pineapple, orange, and lime juice? Especially when they're half off. Something to check out, and it doesn't have to do with food: The peep-holes in the back doors. On the outside they're prisms and on the inside, they're just cool. And look out for the iguana in the restroom!",

    "text": "I'm sorry amigo... but olives and bread as a starter instead of chips and salsa. Really??? Let me begin this review from the very start:  We heard amazing reviews about this place so we decided to stop by and have some lunch. The place was packed full of gueros enjoying their food. We took a seat and as our palates were salivating for some chips and savory salsa, a basket of bread was set down in front of us, and for a spread we were given an olive tapenade. I guess you could say it was one of the best olive tapenade I've ever been served in a Mexican restaurant... it was certainly the first. Besides that the overall place was incredibly authentic, the one Mexican busboy and hostess really added to the diverse atmosphere of the restaurant. My daughter and I ordered fish tacos, we had the option of choosing a salad or fries as a side. I chose the salad and my daughter the fries. When I received the salad my jaw dropped in shock... a bowl with spinach and arugula, dried cranberries, and crumbled cheese, all next to a heaping serving of pico de gallo. The salad was additionally topped with a vinaigrette. That, combined with the poorly made pico de gallo resulted in none of the flavors complimented eachother and overall leaving an unpleasant flavor in my mouth. Gulping down coffee to cleanse my palate I was ready for my fish tacos. The tacos were good, but nothing outstanding or as delicious as people described in their reviews. The tacos were Similar to the salad, they were drenched in even more pico de gallo. In conclusion the best thing about our lunch at Barrios was my daughters fries. It had just the right amount of paprika, and salt, the crispness was on point! If there's one thing this Mexican restaurant knows to do it's make some pretty darn tasty fries.",

Not unlike United States except your average Mexican has more in savings and less debt than the average US of A-er.  Going to Barrio to get a taco, chips, salsa, rice and beans is the equivalent of going to Des Moines, Iowa for seafood.  Order the tamarindo sauce or the red mole -- yes there is more than one kind of mole.  Order anything rubbed in Achiote. Have an amazing tequilla neat as your dessert as the uber knowledgeable staff can steer you in the right direction.  And the tacos for $1.50 at happy hour with a half price low rider will knock your socks off.  Truly is \"effin' good food\" as the t-shirts say.  Other idioms also apply.",

The pork was also incredible -- slow cooked so it literally melted off the bone and needed no knife.  Service was a little slow, but I think that's because the place was packed.  I am a patient person, so I didn't really mind.  The food was out of this world, so I can't imagine fussing about the wait staff!!  I would definitely go again and would bring more friends next time.",

The only aspect in which my C.P. exceeds theirs is the fresh habanero salsa I serve on the side. I'm writing this review from my POV, thus the four stars; however, I made the mistake of recommending the dark mole to a dinner companion, which turned out to be much more earthy, smokey and strong tasting than I recall. Too much char on the chilis, perhaps? I couldn't blame my friend for getting through less than half his plate. (Perhaps this is a matter of personal preference, but I enjoyed the moles in Oaxaca much more.) All in all, I still highly recommend this restaurant for its quality ingredients and authentic flavors.",

Don't go here is you are looking for New Mexico food....the flavors at Barrion were bold and creative. Also, don't expect New Mexico prices but, for me, the food was worth the prices. Very cute atmosphere too. I will make this a priority on my next trip to Phoenix.  P.S. I did fell our waiter was arrogant. Almost like he didn't want to be working that night or we were too much trouble for him to be serving us. He's the guy with the goatee. Needs an attitude adjustment.",

Can't count me in as a fan though. First, the prices are ridiculous, even by bay area standards. Entrees are $12-$28. Yes, the tableside guac was yummy but $10.75 for one avocado plus some fixings??? The waitress raved about the mole and I ordered the enchiladas mole. Their mole goes way too heavy on the chocolate-kind of a hershey's syrup on an enchilada effect. It was plenty of food with the side veggies but $18.00 for 2 enchiladas and some veggies?? Hmmm... The margarita on the rocks was delicious. with a $1.00 upgrade to a better tequila. Sorry Phoenix.

    "text": "Went here for happy hour Friday, after looking at the menu, I don't know that I could justify going any other time. I mean I will go back and have dinner once, and then decide then, but this place is pretty pricey. Happy hour is $1.50 tacos and half price drinks. The tacos are little street tacos and are so perfect. They have duck, carne asada, chorizo and avocado, shrimp, halibut, shredded pork, poblano hash, but with a more fancy name. I think they all pretty much had an avocado slice, and the sauce that comes on the shrimp one is not the same as the one on the halibut. It comes with only one corn tortilla per taco which I love cause I usually either split it into two tacos anyway or throw one out . The hot sauce salsa stuff that comes on the platter was pretty good too. Of course there is a little lime wedge for each too. We started with 4 of the flavors, 2 each, and because they were so good, we tried 2 more flavors, soo the only one I haven't tried was the carne asada, but it has to be good.   Now the drinks, holy moly they are StiFF. Started off with the \"Sangria\" which had the description of Red Wine, Mango Puree, and Jack Daniels. Ok, at Jack Daniels is where I should have said no way you will like it, get something else. My intuition was correct again, and it was terrible, it was Jack Daniels on the front and back end. Thankfully my boyfriend took it down. He started with the LowRider Margarita, which was perfect. Didn't taste any sweet and sour! I then moved on to the Jamaica Margarita which was patron, grand mariner, hibiscus flower, it was pretty good, but super strong. The BF then had a Pink Cadillac, which wasn't that good, but I could probably see people liking it's strangeness. Definitely not for the premixed bottle margarita drinkers.   If this place was simply a taco stand, I'd given it 5 stars. I will definitely update when I can get back and try their dinner, cause it all sounded fantastic.",

I have to admit the guacamole is very good but I could make that at home for about 75 cents. They make it at your table with one avocado and a little sprinkle of cilantro, onions, salt, lime, etc. The entrees are also very small and very expensive. These prices are ok at more upscale restaurants, but you can find better Mexican food at cheaper prices. My husband is from Guadalajara and was horrified at the prices they charged + the size of the portions + the mediocre quality and authenticity of the food. The Sangria was tasty but $11??? Come on! One might expect to see these prices in New York, but not in Phoenix!   Also, the service was just ok. There is just nothing outstanding enough here to justify the prices. I don't mind springing for an expensive meal as long as it is worth it, and this place just isn't.  The food and music is quite good but it does not come close to matching the prices. I will not return for that reason.",

Had I written this review just a couple years ago, I would have said, \"joyous, joyous, joyous.\" My how times have changed. I once held Barrio in very high esteem, recommended it to out of town visitors, and regularly thought of it as some of the best Mexican food I had enjoyed outside of Mexico. Well, no more... Went last Saturday night and I seriously thought it had new owners. The dirty truth... Service: Terrible, terrible service. From the host, to the bartender, to the server, we received rushed, unfriendly, inattentive treatment. When entrees are in the $20+ range I expect better service than what I've experienced at most fast food joints.  Food:  Who stopped caring in the kitchen? It used to feel like the food was lovingly made by a gourmet Mexican grandma. Now it was just slopped on the plate. We ordered the table side guac and it was thrown together so fast and the server didn't even take the time to ask how we wanted it (spice, mild, etc.). It was fine but not as special as on previous visits. My favorite seasonal dish is the Chilis en Nogada - a whole chili stuffed with chicken and dried fruits with a creamy almond sauce and fresh pomegranates. In this past, this dish was dreamy! On this night it was a nightmare. Dried out chicken, bland chile, and so sweet it was barely edible. Also, it was served with a side of cold unseasoned steamed zucchini and bland mashed potatoes that added absolutely nothing to the dish. After an experience like that, I'm sad to say Barrio is officially off my list.",

We had heard many good reviews of this place and were excited to try it for ourselves. As I'm not a huge fan of margaritas (crazy, I know), I opted for the michelada. It was fantastic with just the right amount of heat and the cayenne salt on the rim added that extra kick. We started with the tableside guacamole and like so many others have said, it was great. I enjoyed that it was chunky with a little added sweetness. For my main entree I chose the Cochinita Pibil meal. I love the many varieties of pulled pork out there and this was scrumptious. I had to stop myself from eating the whole thing and ended up taking part of it home for breakfast the next morning (it reheats wonderfully, plus throw a fried egg on top and yum!). My friend decided on the chicken torta and she very much enjoyed her meal. She thought the spicy fries were perfectly seasoned and loved that the ketchup had a smoky flavor that was undoubtedly homemade. We did not have enough room for dessert, sadly. The service was well-paced and our server took the time to happily explain anything on the menu we might have questions about. I would certainly return. This is a great Phoenix hotspot.",

I wasn't hungry for the full entrees so I went with the tinga tacos which are one of my fav's.  They were pretty good and I couldn't finish all 4 of them with the fries so I would say for the price they were worth it.  I read many people say this place is over priced but if you look at the portions and quality of the meal I would say you are wrong.  If you want a cheap good meal then there are many places for that this is for a nice meal with lot's of flavor and variants over tradition.  As I was reading through the menu options I saw things that you can't get at most Mexican restaurants here in Phoenix but some things you can and yes they may be cheaper at other places.  So just plan ahead eat something special here and enjoy it.  This is one place I will sure be back to for dinner and some more of that yummy homemade horchata.",

The place is tiny for sure and you most likely will have to wait, but have a cocktail and enjoy the atmosphere. The food is more from Southern Mexico and completely different from the other options in town. I have loved everything I have ever tried here. The guac that they make at your table is a nice show for visitors and natives alike. The service is always good and the crowd is always lively. Give it a try sometimes, you will be glad you did.",

My husband and I had been trying to make it in there for a while now but everytime we go there it's packed so we opt for something less crowded.  We finally popped in during lunch; it's pretty cozy inside.  The server was rude, anything we said he acted like he had no idea what we were talking about and never cracked a smile.  I had the pollo poblano- the sauce was lacking in flavor, chicken was dry.  For the price I was expecting something better.  I didn't even like the margarita and I've never met a drink I didn't like.  Maybe the Chingona was out?",

We can all recommend the Guacamole, made fresh, table-side, and the \"real\" margarita's -- Tequila, agave nectar, lime juice -- none of that rancid \"sweet and sour\" stuff, thank heavens! I enjoyed the Tacos de Pescado (fish tacos), Bob had the Pescado del Mar (halibut w/a shrimp, scallop, lobster sauce), and Ron had the Cochinita Pibil (slow roasted pork). This ain't no Taco Bell, folks! Fantastic, fresh authentic Mexican food! We finished with a digestif (sipping tequila) Don Julio Anejo - YUM! I would give this place 5 stars, except there needs to be more appetizer and entree choices for those of us with soft shell seafood allergies -- Yes, I know everything can be made without certain ingredients -- but if you take off the shrimp or lobster or crab and are not prepared to make it differently, I feel a little \"cheated\" on the experience (not to mention, price).  And please, do NOT remove the choices you have now as my husband and friends LOVE them! ;)",

I tried three dishes, the slow roasted pork, the tamarindo duck and the stuffed chile.  They were poor, ok and good in that order.  The pork was dry, even with the juices poured over it.  The duck was lost in the tamarindo sauce.  I like tamarindo so it was ok, but some of the flavor of the duck should have come through.  The stuffed chile was really nice.  For the sides, the calabasas (squash medley) were good and so were the potatoes, I would have gone with roasted instead of mashed if there was a choice.  For portions, only the pork was a good sized dish.  The duck was just right and the chile was not enough food.  It is nice to see a Mexican restaurant try to expose people to things besides enchiladas with a side of rice and beans.  They just need to make the food better, lower their prices, take reservations and fire our dour waitress.",

    "text": "Holy Mole!   It's been about 4 years since I first experienced Barrio Cafe and although much time has past they still know how to rock the mole!   I started talking about Barrio Cafe with a friend a few weeks ago and last night we were finally able to make it meet for dinner.   I've read some of the previous concerns with the wait staff and can honestly say that we had nothing but superior service.  Our waiter (sorry do not remember his name!) was super attentive and although the place was buzzing (especially for a Wednesday night!) was very pleasant and extremely informative.  The rest of the staff was also right on it! Drink refills were timely, etc. All were very attentive but definitely not intrustive!  The bread and tapenade were very good... great flavors for sure!  We saw several people ordering the table side guacamole and decided to start off the meal with that!  A-MAZE-ZING! Made to your taste with fresh ingredients... in fact my friend, who does not like anything spicy preferred to skip the fresh chopped jalepenos.. the waiter asked if I would like a spoonful separately on a plate.  Very impressed in his thoughtfulness to accomodate both of us!  Hands down the best was the dried cranberries in the guacamole... Who would have thunk such a simple addition could put this over the top?!? (btw... the waiter did share that they you fresh pomegranite in place of the cranberries when the are in season) Can't wait to try making this at home!  For the entree's I had the Pollo en Mole... Folks... this is how mole is meant to be!  This is a deep black Oaxacan mole with complex flavors that meld together in your mouth for a blissful experience... perfectly cooked chicken...served with a side of wonderfully cooked vegtables and mashed potatoes...  wonderful!   My friend order one of the specials of the night... Don't quote me on the name but I believe it was Pescado a la Veracruzana.   Huge... and I mean HUGE seared halibut steak cooked in a wonderful wine sauce and topped with olives, capers, tomatoes and fresh herbs... oh but that's not all!  It also included a lobster tail that was perfectly cooked with just enough garlic! And just in case that's not enough her's also came with the veggie's & potatoes...  After eating our fill and still asking for half the meal to be boxed up we decided that we would share and order of flan... Again perfection... too often flan is",

He goes there twice on seperate occasions but both times they were closed. Today, as every Friday, Abe gets the urge to treat himself, he finds the Barrio Cafe after parking at Mercer Mortuary down the block since a sign told him he could.  11:40 Arrives at BC 11:41 Gets Seated immediately by what appears to be the owner, nice packed jeans\" he thought. after responding to a salutation from what appears to be his partner  11:45 Notices there is hardly anyone in this joint however the couple across from me have a \"I am here look\" that Abe is used to since he has been a waiter in his past. No one seems to come to their aid.  11:48 a smartly dressed (in black) young man asks to get his drink to which Abe at the same time gives his order for the Taco Felitito (filet mignon steak taco)  11:55 Abe gets the side salad 12:00 Abe reads articles from his magazine 12:10 Abe continues reading more articles 5 all together all while wondering where his food is \"medium rare steak takes 7 1/2 minutes to cook he thinks\"  12:10 Abe sees other people coming into the place and filling this 30 seat cafe, he sees them getting their orders and eating all while drinking 3 glasses of Ice Tea 12:15 The waiter comes with no apology and says the \"sandwich\" will be ready in a few--Abe thinks \"he didn't even get the order in till now\" 12:20 dissatisfied Abe walks out, he drives back to his company where he works and orders 2 tacos from the company cafeteria instead.

Skip the bread...it's a Mexican restaurant after all.  5.  Pork tacos or enchilada suiza are the best things on the menu.  6.  Check out the restroom...be inspired.   7.

It has great reviews, the chef is often featured in local magazines, lots of people love it, etc.  I just never made it because my all-time favorite restaurant in town is also on 16th street (La Condesa aka La Santisima). On a number of occasions I've planned to go to Barrio but once I'm on 16th Street I just go to La Santisima because I love that place.  Anyway, today I finally went to Barrio, and will never make this mistake again.    First, the food was mediocre, at best. I will admit that their guacamole was delicious. But that's about it.  I literally didn't eat my plate.  That's how bad it was.  Second, everything was over-priced.  I have no problem paying higher price for good food, but this just isn't worth it.  For example, that delicious guacamole is $13. The fries that came with the tacos tasted like cheap grocery store frozen pre-cut fries, which is gross.  The corn tortillas that the tacos came in were terrible--mealy and dry, and the salsas (2 kinds) just tasted like vinegar--no complex flavors or spice.  Third, and most upsetting, the service was horrendous.  It was possible one of the worst service experiences I've had in a restaurant in town.    So I'm glad I tried it, because now I will never wonder about heading here when I'm craving Mexican food, and will definitely never go back to this place.",

Portions are big so my husband and I shared the slow roasted pork (very tasty and a lot of food so I'm glad I shared it), guacamole with pomegranate (was a nicer texture than expected), a crepe dessert (almost too sweet) and a horchata in a 0.5L Old school Coke bottle. \"Chicago\" the bar tender shared stories of his travels and our conversations drifted to living a more authentic life...

So, anyhow- again, the mariscos enchiladas were killer. I did find a shell in my food again, but only 1 this time. My margarita was not very good- I tried a house one this time. It was just very sweet. My friend had one that was sort of a red color. It wasn't very good either. I don't think he finished it. He originally tried to order a different one, but the server told him not to- said it tasted like \"cough syrup\".  The food tastes good, the drinks just aren't great. It's very expensive. It was $13 for guacamole. They make it table side, but our server put in way too much lime juice, so it was... well, it was okay, but probably not $13 ok.  I don't know... $95 for 2 drinks, 1 guacamole and 2 entrees seems steep to me. I do like the place, but I think it will just be a once in awhile spot. I have had much less expensive meals at swankier places in the valley. It's not that swank is important- I just am weighing the value differences.  Our server discouraged my friend from many of his entree choices telling him certain things were not good... eek. I appreciate her honesty, but kinda a bad sign about the food.",

    "text": "I planned to meet a friend here for lunch. The day before, I saw in the Arizona Republic that Barrio Cafe would be featured on the Cooking Channel's Taco Wars show. I watched and knew that I had to get the cochinita pibil.  First of all, Barrio Cafe has extraordinary murals on and around the building. It creates a fantastic atmosphere. Inside also had very vivid artwork. It's cozy and a little loud, but it's not too hard to hear people.  I was not thrilled by the complimentary bread and tapenade. The bread was okay, not noteworthy at all. The tapenade just didn't do anything for me. I would have much preferred the standard chips and salsa. This was the most disappointing aspect of my visit.  Both of us ordered the pork, and it was indeed as delicious as it looked on the TV show. It was messy--the little corn tortillas soaked through right away--but my fork and napkin did their jobs. The salad on the side was fresh, but not outstanding. I really liked the dried cranberries--they were plump and delicious.  For dessert, we shared the churros. Oh my. EPIC CHURROS, PEOPLE. Loosen your pants, grab your forks. Best churro I have ever had, no question. It's served with a massive scoop of vanilla ice cream and a slathering of cajeta (goat caramel). A cat could have a bath in this puddle of caramel goodness. It's probably a good thing I was in public and with a friend, or I probably would have  licked the platter clean.  I was afraid it would be a lot crazier because of the TV show coverage, but I think it was to our benefit to come on a Thursday afternoon. The restaurant stayed busy the entire time but I never saw anyone need to wait for a table. The parking lot was small but there always seemed to be a few spaces open.  Overall, it's probably the freshest Mexican food I've had here in Phoenix, though not a life-changing experience. Maybe my expectations were a little too high. I would like to return here with my husband and try some other dishes.",

    "text": "Chef Silvana is renowned as one of the top Mexican Chefs in the country, and it's for a reason, this restaurant. It should be on everyone's \"Must-Try\" list, and the one item above all (everything is delicious) is the Cochinita Pibi; their pork is marinated in achiote and sour  orange, wrapped in a banana leaf and slow roasted over night, topped with pickled red onion   and Yucatan-style pico de gallo, paired with pretty much any of their amazing Maragitas. It's unlike anything you've ever had, and in my top 3 favorite all-time dishes. You won't have any trouble finding the place, as it is covered with murals from local artists, depicting Mexican heritage and culture, with vibrant colors. Much of that can be found on the inside of the restaurant, transferred into food, with various flavors, colors, and options. Be sure to check out some of Chef Silvana's other restaurants, including Barrio Urbano, Barrio Avion (inside Phoenix International Airport) and her newest installment, Barrio Cafe Gran Reserva.",

We felt like we had all the time we wanted but we were never lacking attention from the wait staff.  The food is truly bistro, their \"fish\" is Alaskan halibut cooked to perfection. Everything we ordered was fresh and served at perfect temperatures.  The desserts were not as fabulous but very good. The folks around us seemed to enjoy the drinks coming from their bar. We had a great experience that was uniquely \"Phoenix\"! (Parking in rear and down the side street, enter in the back or in the front doors.)",

You didn't know you needed pomegranate seeds in your guacamole until you've had it, but now....my life goal is to have pom seeds in any guac I make for as long as I'm breathing.  The drinks I tried were the Sergio el suave and the flor de Jamaica margarita. Both excellent and unique. The entree I had was the single best chicken dish I have ever ordered from any restaurant, anywhere. Pollo poblano. Despite this raving review of the entree, when I go back to this delightful hole in the wall, I won't order it again for the simple fact that I will want to try every delicious-sounding item on this menu, confident after this dish that I couldn't be disappointed. I could not have been more pleased with the meal. Ten stars.",

I was expecting a little kick, but there wasn't any.  My friend had the Chiles en Nogada which contained a roasted poblano pepper with chicken, apple pear, dried apricots and and pecans, almond cream sauce, cilantro, queso fresco, and pomegranate seeds.  On the side was chipotle mashed potatoes and veggies.  This is the chef's signature dish, and it was a very flavorful dish.  I took a couple bites and wished I had enough room in my stomach to have a plate of my own.  The waitress was very nice and checked on us several times.

I'm from LA so I'm used to decent Mexican food.  But I moved up to Seattle last year where there is absolutely no good Mexican food.  So as soon as I came down to Phoenix, I rented a car at the airport and drove straight here.  The neighborhood is a little dodgy but not too bad.  There is a small parking lot in the back.  The murals in the parking lot are a little scary looking and the painting inside the restaurant are a bit scary as well but the food was great.  They had live music playing loudly.  It made for a nice and festive atmosphere.  They open until 10:30pm on Fridays and I got there at around 9:45pm.  We ordered and finished eating at around 10:30.  There were only 2 other tables around when we left.  In addition to the pork, the tacos de carne asada were great and the enchilada de mar was also very good.  The table guacamole is a bit gimmicky but was good nonetheless.  They put pomegranate in guac which isn't typical but tasty.  The margaritas were good.

There's NO rice and beans and that's a Mexican food staple, it killed my soul, that's not Mexican food. The margaritas are way over priced, I've had better in Scottsdale for cheaper! The only reason I gave it two stars was the carne asada taco was pretty good and the salsa was great. One time stop for me because 60$ for sub-par \"Mexican food\" is something I'll never do again.",

I mean we knew it was going to be good, but the wait for a table has always deterred us in the past. We were lucky enough to snatch a table right away on Saturday night and our server promptly greeted us and took our drink orders. There was a great 2 piece Carribean style band playing at the front of the crowded restaurant! We ordered chips and guac to start and were surprised when it was made tableside with fresh ingredients by our server! I ordered the Mariscos Enchiladas which were delicious but drenched in the crema sauce to the point that i had to dig to find enchilada! A little less would have been perfect I think! Our service was pristine until it came time to pay the check... we waited about 15 minutes after our leftovers had been boxed up for our server to reappear and present us with our check. By this point business had slowed considerably so I was a little confused as to how he forgot about us, but never the less a great dining experience overall!",

You must get there very early to get a seat, but they do have a new place outside to wait, if you have to.

    "text": "My new favorite. Although, I think the food is overpriced and the long lines unbearable. Despite the hype around this restaurant, I think the food and experience deserve the kudos.   My yelp \"tag line\" is Erika \"waits in no line\" Keenan. I hate waiting in line. And I don't wait in line. I pride myself in being a person that doesn't get sucked into hype. I guess that's why it took me so long to try the Barrio Cafe.  Don't make the same mistake.   Parenthesis to my review and to help add a little background:  My mother is from Central Mexico (Born in Leon, Juanajuato and raised in Mexico City). She even owned her own Mexican restaurant in upstate New York. This food reminds me very much of what I grew up with -- but adds a twist (I hesitate to call it gourmet-ish) that is what must create the buzz.   The location is not sexy -- which is another reason why I loved the experience. (Not the best reason to choose a restaurant, but one that always adds extra appeal to my decision making process :) The space is small, but I didn't feel confined. The service was not rushed - but everything came out timely.   Richard, the host, informed us that we would have an hour wait.  But it really only took 35 minutes (still a lifetime to someone who doesn't like to wait in lines).    But, I was celebrating my birthday with friends, so I think I was distracted and maybe a little more forgiving.  My party started with the guacamole. They add pomegranates - which I guess is the \"gourmet\" twist.  Back East, avocados may be more expensive, but out here, no.  Not sure where the $10 price tag comes from - maybe those damn pomegranates.  A nice add - but not necessary.   Since the guac is made fresh at the table, you can always ask to omit the pomagranates, or any of the additional incredients for that matter, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't reduce the cost.  For the main course, I enjoyed the Enchiladas Suizas and my friend enjoyed the Enchiladas de Mole. Both were incredible and I'm confident my mother would approved of the mole. My friend and I both agreed we loved the Enchiladas Suizas best though. (By the way, we had to take part of our meals home and, for the record, the reheated well when we had the leftovers for breakfast this morning.)   I do think the food is a pricey (especially considering what I remember my mother charging in New York for the same dishes -- well ok -- she never served pomegranates in the guacamole).   But, overall I honestly think this is a great place - and I'm so proud Phoenix has someplace that actually services central Mexican food (there's more to Mexico than a double flour tortilla with cheese in the middle or a burrito).   For another Mexican restaurant - without the hype, the gourmet twist, or the price tag, try Tortas la Presa on 24th St.",

Not our first time, gave this place chances after chances before writing it off.  The hostess kept telling us 20 minutes, after 20 minutes went by, another 15-20 minutes, etc.  We saw people that just walked in get seated before us!    Wasn't greeted when we entered, not even a \"Hi, can I help you?\"  Wait area outside or in the bar area.  My car is bigger than the bar /waiting area!  I don't have a big car!  The bartender was the only person in the place that we considered the most friendly.  Well, the mango margarita at $12 was okay! Our meal tab was also over $120  for one salad, one appetizer, 1 sandwich, 1 mixed seafood dinner and the slow cooked pork dinner;  2 beers;  AND was almost charged for 2 extra beers we had ordered but never got!!!  So check your checks!!!!!  No one smiles in the place which is filled with beautiful artwork that's for sale!  The music is blaring so everyone has to shout to talk to each other.  Good thing my husband and our male friend have loud voices.  The female waitress, again, seemed like she was having a bad day....or life? Had no interest in our opinions about the food, plates were plopped down on the tables, she came to check on us twice, 2nd time, the guys asked for 2 more beers which never came.   The whole experience started at 6:30pm and ended at 10!!   Service and the meals didn't match the prices!!!!! Ouch!!  A hole in a wall place that leaves a hole in your pocket!!",

I always start my meal with the guacamole (my mom asked if it was made from guaca's). They make it fresh at your table at dinner time. The pomegranate adds a great taste to it. They also bring out bread with an olive garlic spread. That is absolutely amazing. I always order the Pollo Poblano. I can't even describe how tasty this is. The chicken is tender, the onions and pine nuts (i think thats what they are) mixed with the creamy sauce is very unique, and hits on every taste bud.This meal is not spicy to me at all. It comes with this white cheese that just tops the dish off perfectly. The deserts are amazing and so are the drinks. And if that's not enough, the art work in the area is great motivation to walk your meal off a little. I live in the west valley so I always come here for special occasions, and it is worth the drive!!!",

Best spur of the moment dining decision I've ever made! Having grown up in southern California and living in Arizona I have a special fondness for Mexican cuisine, and I can honestly say Barrio gave me the best example of how you can do modern gourmet cuisine and retain classic Mexican styles.  First off the Quesadilla de langosta borracha made me reconsider what it means to be a quesadilla, and in a good way!  The Chile Relleno was amazing, open faced and covered in amazing cheeses, scallops and shrimp and accompanied by perfectly roasted squash and onions. Heavenly!  To wash that down with a properly made Michelada Picocito was just icing on the cake.  Speaking of cake, try the churros, they basically ruined zoos and fairs for me from now on because no $6 carnival churro will ever compare!  Now I just have to return 10 more times to try everything else on the menu that looked amazingly good! Comida Chingona is right!",

Also I guess the bartender poured an extra glass of the Nebiola so she gave it to me for free.  Delicious. I usually don't like drinking red in the summer, but this was smooth and slightly jammy. Good move on her part because my friends enjoyed the wine so much we all ordered glasses ($11 a glass).   There was live entertainment with a guitarist which perked up the whole restaurant even more.   I didn't care so much for the bread they served. We started with appetizers: guacamole and queso fundido. Both were  excellent. The queso is a bit heavy and we only had a few bites each to make room for our entrees.  The conchinita pibil was excellent--tender slow-roasted pork with mash potatoes on the side. Large enough portion that I brought the leftovers home and it fed me and the roomie the next evening. YL had the enchilades de hongos which she enjoyed.   For dessert we shared the flan de mi mami. Nice.",

If you are going south on 16th Street, it will be on your right hand side after Thomas Rd.  It's across the street from a strip mall and honestly there's not much else around.    Their small parking lot is in back of the restaurant.  But inside, fantastic Mexican food and a cornucopia of Tequilas await you.  Guacamole is made fresh table-side.  Tell them to go easy on the dried cranberries or raisins.  The menu has a long list of authentic Mexican dishes.  The mole sauce is very good but definitely try the fish tacos.   Prices are reasonable, be prepared to spend around $20-25 for dinner.  All in all, Barrio is a great experience.",

For us out in The QC, it's a bit of a hike for dinner, but for me the food was well worth it.  We arrived at around 6:45pm on a Friday night and had about a less than 10 minute wait (4 of us).  We sat and listened to the live music for the night by Gustavo Angeles.  Pretty great guitar player.  I friggin love latino music and so the vibes were awesome for me.  Food - was great.  I had the Chile Relleno and also got a side of a slow-roasted pork taco (had to try it).  The Relleno was fantastic for me.  Not battered like others, but full of flavor and I really liked it.  Wife had the Mole which I thought was good (rich, but good...but all Mole is).  We had guacamole made at our table...pretty basic, but addition of 'craisins' were actually a good touch.    Dessert was amazing.  Goat's milk caramel stuffed churros...are you kidding me?!?!!? Wow, they were good.  As we were sitting the table next to us got served Tortas...I always expect Tortas not to be enough for dinner, but don't write them off here...LARGE.  If I go back, I'll have one of those.  Perhaps the only two things my wife and I walked away from with a thought was the price.  For us non-drinkers, our bill was $75.  The Yelp rating of $11-30 doesn't give a good range.  If you aren't getting Tortas or Tacos, expect $20/person + drinks and appetizer and dessert costs.  The other: a bit loud...expected in a smaller area though...wasn't bad, just noticeably louder than most places.  We love the experience though and time with friends is great!  Recommend if in the area.",

The restaurant is super cute and has a nice ambiance about it - beautiful paintings by local artist adorn the wall, live music and fragrant scents fill the air. The perfect atmosphere for a delicious meal!  Barrio Cafe does not take reservations. We had a party of six and waited around 10 minutes - not bad for a busy Saturday night. We started with the highly recommended Quesdalilla de Langosta Borracha (lobster on corn tortillas) - delicious and not too heavy! I ordered the Enchiladas Suizas (chicken with a tomatillo cream sauce) and tried my friends Cochinita Pibil (slow roasted pork). No complaints from anyone at the table. I could tell we were all savoring our meals as our table was actually quiet!   The waiter was kind enough to bring out a Flan de mi Mami in celebration of my friends birthday. Too bad we had brought a cake with us. I did manage to try a tsp of it though....nothing beats a good flan. :)  The only negative is the noise level. It was Saturday night and the restaurant was pretty full. The lively patrons combined with the live music in the background made it virtually impossible to hear my friends across the table and I have pretty good hearing.  I would definitely come back!

Usually something like that would play heck with our digestive system (getting old sucks). However, this stuff was amazing, easy on the belly, and we couldn't stop eating it.

I think you have to let them know you're coming back so they don't assume you've given up. I agree that the waiting area is very small when busy. If it wasn't so cold outside, I wouldn't have minded sitting on the benches. I guess you have to be really patient!  Food: I got the tacos de pescado (fish tacos) and my friend got the cochinita pibil (slow roasted pork). My dish came with either a side salad or fries; i opted for the salad. The tacos were delicious. The fried halibut was not too greasy and the avocado was fresh and ripe! The drizzle of chipotle cream sauce was just enough to give it a little spice. Yummy! I tried my friend's pork, and I didn't enjoy it as much as my dish. He had a side of something that was SUPER spicy!!!!! I don't remember what it was called but it kinda resembled mashed potatoes. Portions were a good size, not too little, not too much.  For dessert, we shared the Churros. I was a little hesitant because I read it was filled with goat's milk caramel. I love churros, and i love caramel, but goat's milk caramel? I was pleasantly surprised. The churros were divine! I think it may have been too much for us since we'd eaten all of our food. But I'd say definitely go for the Churros if you have a little  room in your belly!!!!  The place was a little loud since they had live music and lots of people. The decor was nice, not super fancy which I like.  Our server was very helpful in my choice of dish.    PROS: great fish tacos. AWESOME churros. good service. CONS: Wait during busy times (they don't take reservations either...boo), parking is supposedly tough since parking lot in the back is quite tiny though.

Finding parking is part of the adventure.  There is a wait - wouldn't you be worried if a place this small was half-full?  And yes, the Guacamole is basic, but that's exactly how its supposed to be - if a blender or food processor is involved, its not gonna be good.    The slow roasted pork is absolutely incredible.  The margarita's are great, and the wife and I even split an expensive shot of tequila (thanks to the big spenders at the next table over for the inspiration).  The Tilapia was also really good.

The guacamole made at the table was excellent, the tortilla chips seemed like they were freshly friend for each table, the extensive margarita list was amazing (I suggest the Cadillac).  Now for the menu, its amazing, I've gone twice and got the same dish the Tacos Cochinita Pibil, like a moist pulled pork taco stewed in Mayan spices and a homemade tasting queso fresco.  I cannot recommend this dish, nor this restaurant enough.  Friendly staff, delicious food, reasonable prices, relaxed atmosphere.",

    "text": "I'm in utter disbelief of how bad this place was. With all of the amazing reviews I thought there was no way it could be bad. How on earth do they get such great reviews in AZ? There's so much better Mexican food here, even right down the street from Barrio. I will say the guacamole is great-super fresh but super awkward when your Henry Rollins look alike server is angrily smashing it together next to your table. Apparently he doesn't like that part of his job. Actually, it seemed like he pretty much hated his job, which may have ruined a lot of my experience. We ordered our guac & he asked if we wanted anything besides water-we told him we hadn't looked at the drink menu yet and he slams it back on the table and says \"Guess I'll leave this here then\"....sorry, Henry. I'm also the kind of person that says \"thank you\" throughout my meal...like when you fill my glass, bring my food, take my plate etc. Not once did he say \"you're welcome\". Such a douche. I did read in one other review that the servers treat you like you should be so lucky to be eating there. Definitely felt it. Anyway, got the Conchinita Pibil Tacos. Pork was dry and tortillas were soggy. You get 4 street tacos on corn tortillas and for some reason someone thinks its a good idea to dump salsa on them so they fall apart by the time they get to your table. Pair that with a side of Ore Ida steak fries and you have yourself a $13 dinner? Thank god I didn't spring for a pricier dish since I thought after the guacamole I'd be mostly full anyway. My boyfriend got the seafood Chile Relleno and said it was ok - for 21 bucks it should have been way better than ok - I don't eat seafood much so I didn't try it but I've seen him get more excited over a shrimp burrito from Senor Taco. To end the evening our server took 10 minutes to pick up our payment from our table, and blatantly ignored my boyfriend trying to get his attention. I took my leftovers in a to go box to be polite when the busser asked if I wanted them since I still had half a plate of food, but did not hesitate to throw them directly into the trash when I got home. I don't even normally write reviews, but I was so blown away by the vast difference between the reviews I'd read and my experience that I just had to. The only reason I'd ever return to this place would be for happy hour. Drinks and guacamole, yes. Dinner - never again.",

    "text": "After years of having this as a bookmark, I was  disappointed and broke afterwards. :( My hubs and I went to the Barrio Cafe on our date night and found that we should have stuck to Popo's on 67th Ave and Indian School.  The place was packed which I thought was a good sign. And let me warn you now, there is limited parking and seating so expect a wait time. Our wait time was 45 min which I'll wait happily if the food is good. I ordered a drink from the small little bar inside. The drink selection was great! They had lots of weird concoctions with horchata and tequila creme which was exciting! I had a drink that mixed horchata with tequila creme and Chambord. It was DELICIOUS and highly recommended ($10.00).   Once we were seated, we were not quickly greeted by our server. The bus boy brought us a bread basket with a tapenade salsa thing dip which I did not like. Our waitress finally came over and greeted us hurriedly as she seemed very busy. We ordered our drinks which we got at a decent time but our server did not come back for another long period. We finally got her attention and she seemed annoyed at us while she was taking our order. I ordered the famous Chiles en Nogadas but I asked to substitute the filling with cheese. The waitress told me that they cannot do substitutions on the dish because it is already premade. Ummmm, WHAT? I waited 45 minutes and traveled all the way from Goodyear, AZ to eat premade food!? I should have left then and there but I didn't because I really wanted to try the food. So I went with the cheese enchiladas and hubs went with the carne asada tacos.   We received our food in a timely manner and the presentation was spot on! But the flavors were not there. My cheese enchiladas ($19.00) tasted like something I warmed up in the microwave. The red sauce tasted canned and the tortillas were hard. My husband said he liked his tacos but it was nothing spectacular or worth the $13.00 price tag (for 3 tacos btw). The only thing I enjoyed from the restaurant was the ambience, the spectacular hortchata, and the live music. Everything else was overpriced and mediocre. I would come back only for drinks next time. Can't go wrong with booze!",

    "text": "I finally got to visit Barrio last week for the first time, and like most everyone, I was not disappointed. I did however need some help from the server choosing what I should eat and drink. For 2 reasons. One: Everything looked so interesting and good. Two: The title's were in Spanish and I was not familiar with some of the meat's and their name's in Spanish. He suggested the Paloma. A Drink I am a fan of and I would have to say this is one of the best Paloma's I've had, perfectly balanced, sweet, tart, strong, yet not over powering.   I remember hearing some where about their bread and olive spread and how fabulous it was. Sure enough, very satisfying. To start we got the Esquites: Buttered roasted corn kernels topped with chipotle cream, aged cotija cheese, cilantro and fresh lime juice. The perfect way to start a meal, it was light so that it did not fill us up too much yet so rich and zesty. For my entree I finally settled on Enchiladas del Mar: Blue corn tortillas filled with quesos Oaxaca and de cabra, topped with shrimp, lump crab and scallops in a tomatillo cream reduction. Talk about rich. The sauce was rich but didn't over power any flavor of the seafood. The Quesos Oaxaca Cheese strangely complimented the seafood and the portion was very generous. We finished the night off with the Churros Rellenos de Cajeta de Cabra:  Churros filled with goat's milk caramel, served with vanilla bean ice cream,and topped with mas caramel and candied pecans. The goat's milk caramel was a bit too much for me. However, my husband licked this plate clean. I was impressed. I couldn't get enough of the candied pecans, Carmel and ice cream.  I think what made this night so special though is the atmosphere of this place. It was small and cozy. They had this amazing live music. 2 men, a few instruments, and beautiful voices. They were very funny as well. They made us giggle, bob our heads, and sway to the music as we enjoyed our meal. I really cant wait to bring some friends and family to this place.",

We picked this spot because we had some out of town guests that wanted some authentic Mexican food.  As I was trying to decide where to go, my boyfriend said - it doesn't really matter where we go, food will all be the same.  At the end of the evening, he agreed that that he was wrong.        This not your typical Mexican restaurant.  They have many of the 'typical' Mexican dishes on the menu - tacos, enchiladas, fajitas, but the composition and flavor combinations are not typical.  Instead of chips and salsa, they brought bread and olive tapenade.  Instead of mexican rice and beans, our dishes came with side of roasted vegetables and mashed potatoes.          We went on a Saturday night with a party of 5 at 7pm.  There was a 30-45 minute wait.  We drank and had appetizers at the bar so it went by quickly.  The service was top notch and the live music created a fun atmosphere.  The music is loud, so maybe not the most ideal spot if you're trying to have an intimate conversation.  Entrees between $16-$30.",

    "text": "I stopped into Barrio on my recent trip to Phoenix after reading numerous raving reviews from \"Best Mexican in the US\" lists. I chose the skinny margarita, which I loved and decided to have two. Since it was my first, and perhaps only time, I chose the pork in banana leaf for my entree, or the Cochinita Pibil. The pork is marinated in achiote and sour orange, and then slow roasted in a banana leaf. The meal can be shared, and it is served with fresh warm corn tortillas that were the perfect accompaniment, along with some Mexican zucchini squash.  There were so many things I wanted to try on the menu, so I definitely would love to return soon. If you're looking for Mexican cooking that is creative and not just the traditional offerings, this is the place for gourmet in a reasonable casual atmosphere with very warm service.",

    "text": "First of all, my disclaimer is that I think I would have enjoyed Barrio Cafe much better as a smaller group. We were a group of 10 and knowing that they didn't take reservations, we were expecting to wait so that wasn't a real issue. However we did wait over an hour while every other group of 5 or less walked in the door and was seated immediately. I have worked in the restaurant business so I know that it isn't easy to seat large parties in a small dining room, but what was a little disappointing was that once we were seated, the service was slow. It took us quite a while to get drinks at the table and even water was a bit of a wait. Then ordering our food was another wait. The restaurant was constantly busy so my thought is that maybe they are under-staffed.  That being said, the bartender was great. While waiting for over an hour in their tiny bar space, we were served appetizers and drinks. The drinks are terrific and their tequila selection, impressive! However, I was underwhelmed by the food and we had mixed responses at the table. I ordered the Granada con Flor de Jamaica - A large pork chop served with pomegranate and hibiscus flower port reduction, crispy shallots and a candied hibiscus flower. I thought the sauce was fantastic and the pork chop was quite good, but slightly overcooked for my liking. (I know people still prefer their pork somewhat well done, but it doesn't need to be!) I don't recall crispy shallots, but maybe I missed them. The potatoes served with the dish were very tasty but barely warm and the zucchini side was - eh. Some of the other dishes at the table were the  Enchiladas del Mar - Blue corn tortillas filled with quesos Oaxaca and de cabra, topped with shrimp, lump crab and scallops in a tomatillo cream reduction. Way too heavy on the cheese for my taste (and the person who ordered it). The Pollo en Mole - Spice rubbed, pan seared chicken breast topped with a bold and flavorful Mole de Oaxaca was good. Again the sauce was a winner.   So there is definite talent in the kitchen, but not a home run for me or my guests. If I were local, I would probably try them again with a group of 4 or less. Being an out-of-towner, there are too many other spots to try in the area, so it may be a while before I return.  P.S.  I just realized their menu says \"grilled to order\" under the pork chop entree's. I was never asked how I wanted it grilled so that could have resolved the \"too well done\" issue for my pork...",

That being said - the food was fantastic. I would have given this 5 Stars if it weren't for the VERY slow service. I believe it was an entire hour from sit down to plate placement. Grant it, we weren't ready to order when the waiter first came. But it didn't take us long to decide. There were other tables seated, but nothing he shouldn't have been able to handle.  I ordered the Chiles en Nogada... Holy unexpected surprise of yumminess. Check it out on their website, it was chicken and a concoction of super fabulousness inside the Chile. I made it a point to notice what my date had, but now I've forgotten. He said it was terrific, though (I do believe it was one of their Enchilada dishes).  The bread they serve before seems to be just your average bread but it comes with a really good olive spread.  Parking isn't great. It's a tiny strip mall, but you can probably park on the street of the two side streets there.  You should go. Just be patient and ready to wait. Make sure you're with good company to entertain you while you wait!",

This is my 2nd time visiting it while in Phoenix to see my parents, and I can officially confirm now it will be on all future trips!  Love the happy hour tacos because you can try a bunch of different flavors.  This time we went for regular post-happy hour dinner and it was still amazing. The enchiladas are amazing... wow. As is the pork that is on the top of the entree menu (I'm blanking on the name).  Drinks are outstanding as well, but very pricey for the neighborhood.  These cocktails are more like what I would expect to pay in Chicago at a restaurant downtown.  If it's your first time going there, you have to check out the bathroom... you'll get a giggle, it's intense!",

My hubby is a self-proclaimed margarita connesuir. He had the signature marg followed by the pineapple jalapeno one and loved them both. I don't like tequila so I had the horchata and omg it was amazing! When we were seated I ordered the guacamole, thanks to other yelp reviews, and it did not disappoint. In fact, the guacamole had to be the best I've ever had. It has pomegranate seeds in it, which sounds weird, but absolutely made it!  The enchilada suiza was delicious and had a sweet taste to it that I wasn't expecting. Next time, I want to try the carne asana tacos. Hubby had the fish tacos and said they are as good as you can get away from the Oceanside. We will definitely be back!",

After that, the waiter would meander by and mumble things like \"Yokay?\" and \"Howboutmore?\" before walking away, not waiting for a response.

I forgot the name, but I ordered the steak filet covered in crab meat and smothered in a perfect amount of mole sauce I think.  Oh my that was tasty.  The flavor was so new to me that I can't even compare it to anything I had before.  The steak was cooked to perfection and even the side of veges was fantastic.  I got the crepe dessert which was equally delicious.  The only downside was the price but that's not really something to expect with this quality of food.

The sandwich was overflowing in its own juices, nearly impossible to eat with hands without making a huge mess.  Like a Mexican sloppy joe.  I also ordered their homemade horchata; not really a fan.  It was flavorful, but I hated the consistency.  Barrio Cafe has live music during lunch hours.  Just some light acoustic, nothing too heavy, so it was quite enjoyable.

I had no problems finding parking (right in the back of the restaurant by all the cool murals) and found nothing dicey about the neighborhood and we arrived around 9pm and were coming from out of town. The spicy margaritas were excellent and the cochinita pibil were super good. We also ordered the Chiles en Nogada dish and it was not only super unique but the TASTIEST dish I have ever had.  Thumbs up!!",

It was jam packed crowded-I loved, LOVED the live band. It was fantastic!!! Our server was neither friendly nor rude, just felt rushed. The prices seemed inflated to me, but the food had lovely presentation. I had the fish in the banana leaf which was very good, and the guacamole was tasty, with the bits of fruit in it. Very unique.

Simply, the fare here is elevated,  People seek Mexican, but for those seeking authentic Mexican, this is a place that serves fare that isn't about tacos or burritos.  Instead, it's about real food done with Mexican flair, spices and sauces.  Here, you will fall in love with chicken for how its prepared with sauces.  Here, you fall in love with guacamole because they throw in some twists.  In other words, they serve dishes that you'd have a really tough time trying to make at home.  To me, that's a good restaurant.",

Barrio isn't horrible, but it certainly is not the most amazing Mexican cuisine that I have had. Barrio is the place that a guy who thinks he's in touch with La Raza (even though he grew up in Scottsdale)and takes his girlfriend to \"a little place in the ghetto\" he knows. For those of us that know what the Barrio is like, Barrio Cafe doesn't live up to its self proclaimed title of \"Comida Chingona\".   I had the pleasure of having dinner at Barrio with my friend Ayesha. One thing that Barrio Cafe does have going for it is their super potent margarita. Maybe that's what makes all the patrons think that the food is so amazing. I had a top shelf margarita. It was really good! The tequila was smooth and the the margarita mix was not too sweet, and not too sour! I overheard our bartender explaining that the margaritas are 50 percent tequila and the rest is mix. Nice! I should have drank more, maybe this review would be a little better for them.   We were seated and greeted by a friendly waiter. He asked us if we would like the fresh made guacamole. Ayesha and I were both excited to try it. He brought around the cart and explained all that went into the guacamole. Well he mashed a bit and then served it to us....um... that's it? Really? It was chunks of avocado with the rest of the ingredients. Ok, you might impress some fools with that mess, but with those of us with mamas that have old, well used molcajetes... this guacamole isn't cutting it one bit. I had to snicker as one half drunk patron next to us declared this was the best guacamole she ever had. *sigh* I was not impressed at all. Hopefully my dinner was better prepared.   For my dinner, I had the enchiladas de mole. They came with sauteed zucchini, which was different than the standard rice and beans you get at other places. The enchiladas were beautiful when they were delivered. The aroma of the mole sauce hinted at their rich flavor. I took my first bite... well.. I guess they were ok. I expect mole to be a dark, spicy (not necessarily hot), never too chocolaty, and a perfect balance of smoke and spice. This took a good run at it but came up short, and I could really taste the chocolate of the mole. The vegetables that they were served with were overcooked and had no flavor to them. I was given a free flan for my birthday which was very nice! The flan was good! It wasn't too jiggly (which Ayesha was fearing) and I believe it might be homemade. Good touch!  Well, I can at least say that I tried Barrio cafe. I would probably go back for their great margaritas and maybe try a different appetizer, maybe after a few more of those strong 'ritas, I'll find out what all the fuss is about.",

Oh yes something did, the loud dining room. It was so loud we were literally shouting at one another from across the table. I love to talk over dinner so my throat was pretty hoarse afterwards.. ah yes, the waiter was a very nice looking man and was super flirty with all of us.. he got a big tip.  Otherwise I scratch my head and wonder why so many people gush over this place? Its not bad, its just blah.",

He recommended we try it before ordering. He brought us some out and glad he did, mole isn't for everyone. With that new knowledge we all order tacos. Carne asada and fish. They were three street style  tacos. Very very good. Fresh avocado on top makes me want to put it on everything! Overall, a great experience and fantastic food!",

    "text": "Sometimes an outsider can give you a different perspective. . .  I flew in from Denver last night and got taken out to Barrio's without knowing anything about it. First thing you notice is that it's one of those white tablecloth and small neighborhood bistro-type Mexican restaurants that are cropping up all over the bigger cities in the Southwest, these days.  You know that's the case when the server comes over to offer you any one of what he claims are the 250 tequilas they have behind the bar. (!?) He describes a margarita special they're offering made with some brand I've never heard of, agave juice and freshly squeezed lime. Sounds unbelieveable, but turns out to be a tad too subtle for me, and those agave sugars are a bit slippery on my tongue.  So, while I politely acknowledge that the first one was good, I tell him, in response to his question, that I like my margaritas with Don Julio and Cointreau and ask for my next one that way.  First downer, he gets a little snooty about what a  rube I am.  Hey. Mr. Cool. I'm your customer. If I like my margarita with ketchup, your job is to give me an enthusiastic smile and ask, \"one squeeze pack or two?\"   Passing by the margarita moment, we start out with table-made guacamole. It's gets 3 stars for not having enough lime, salt or garlic, but still being pretty good.   They add pomegranate seeds for that bistro flair, but while it comes off as interesting, it's not as good as your well-made traditional guac.  They serve their sit-down table salsa with another somewhat contrived bistro element: bread and not chips. Roasted peppers, however, made it pretty tasty, so I'm not complaining.  On to dinner, and actually, that's what gets them up to 4 stars:  their chile en nogada,  I think they call it, was a large poblano chile stuffed with chicken, apricots, peaches (? and another \"!\"), garlic and almonds in a light cream sauce. Very very nice and unusual.  The server said it was a traditional dish from the Puebla area, and it was excellent and finger licking good. A bit of spice finished the dish and made it memorable.  Dessert, on the other hand, was a mediocre flan. A bit too heavy, with no subtlety at all.  Bottom line: creative food, a good attempt at bistro dining, tarnished only a little by a self-impressed server, and prices a bit on the high side. Nonetheless, I'm a fan and would go back.   When I started this review I was going to comment on how strange it was that some people gave it 5 stars and others gave it 1 star.  On reflection, I get it. This place is neat, but a bit too cocky for its own good, and that can make some people pretty upset.  My guess is that Phoenix is big enough to keep this place around for a long time, and that the food and drinks, while somewhat over-priced, will keep em coming back. Thanks, Phoenix, for a very good dining experience.",

I asked for a simple drink and even showed them the recipe- a michelada Cubana, which is simply beer and Bloody Mary spices without the tomato juice. Simple accommodation considering that the regular michelada (with tomato juice) is on the menu. The waiter acted as if I wanted something extra special, and told me that he could not accommodate me??? What?! I guess he forgot how much he was charging for a plate of his restaurant's award winning food... He forgot how much we waited for a table, he even forgot to check and see if he actually could attempt to accommodate my needs. He said \"I will get you the regular michelada, and you don't have to pay for it if you don't like it\" which he promptly forgot about. I left that joint,  went down the street and got everything I wanted, with better service at half the price.  Ole!",

Waaaaay overrated, waaaaaay overpriced.  I was waaaaaay disappointed after hearing all the fabulous reviews from the Anglos.  Don't we live close to the border?     Home cooked or authentic?  Put it this way, go where the Mexicans go to eat if you don't mind being stared at.   How do I know?  I treated my staff, a party of home grown Mexicans, to this gourmet mexican;   we were seriously the ONLY ethnics there.  The ONLY other authentic mexican ethnics we saw there were the guys clearing out the plates.  When my girlfriends spoke to them in spanish and asked what THEY thought about the authenticity of the food, we got a smile;  that was enough---I hope we don't cost the poor guy his job.     Pork dish:  drowned in sauce that all taste was gone.   Beef:  do you like beef jerky?    Repeat after me:  ask where all the ethnics go to eat if you want fabulous authentic ethnic food.   If you want a cute place to bring a date and to impress by shelling a lot of money for a little payback afterwards, this is the place for you!   Not for the gourmande.

After being seated, we were greeted by a wonderful server named Jaime. He was very personable and enthusiastic, and made some recommendations for us. I ordered the cochinita tacos. AMAZING. The pork was to die for. My friend had the mole enchiladas. They were also very good, although we decided they could have had more mole sauce on them. A tad dry. But the mole itself was just like what I remember in Mexico. For dessert we had the churros with vanilla bean ice cream. These were no ordinary churros! So soft and delicious.  Overall, I'd say it was one of the best Mexican food experiences I've ever had. And I am a Mexican food snob!  Do not expect your run of the mill Mexican American food here.

Sorry, but it just doesn't go...  Inside is super loud...they've got speakers all over the place and it's not a big restaurant.  Live music is a nice thought, but it's literally deafening.   Food is just not good.  Tacos were bland.  Table side guacamole has a \"kitchen sink\" recipe and uses avacados that aren't even ripe.  Also had a vegetarian dish that was just roasted veggies covered with a ton of cheese.    Service was not good either.  Waiter forgot what we ordered (writing stuff down would be OK by me...) and stuff came out slow.    Definitely wouldnt go back...",

As soon as we opened the door, we heard the sound of live music and were overtaken by the mouth-watering smells from the kitchen. The waiter was very friendly and helpful.   We ordered the queso fundido as an appetizer and it was life-changing! Sooo rich and tasty, I would've ordered this is a meal by itself. YOU MUST ORDER THIS! For my meal, I ordered the huevos rancheros, which was a light and tasty dish made with black beans instead of pinto beans... yum! With my meal I had a mango mimosa, which was tasty and refreshing. Even though we were already full, the waiter highly recommended the flan and we just couldn't turn it down. The flan was creamy and delectable! It was served with strawberries and little crunchy chocolate pieces. I highly recommend it!  In addition to the food and live music, the other thing that I LOVED LOVED LOVED about this place was the artwork. The Day of the Dead artwork was absolutely breathtaking. I will definitely be coming back to this place the next time I visit Phoenix.",

In the most unexpected of downtown areas, this cafe blends in on the outside but stands out with it's relatively classy interior and of course, with it's delicious food. There are few vegetarian options but the cheese enchiladas with roasted vegetables on the side came in a big platter smothered in gooey cheese and warm goodness. My brother had some meat dish but as a side were chipotle fries which were golden on the outside and the inside (quite possibly some of the most delicious fries I've eaten). They also serve a guacamole with pomegranate seeds in it which was surprisingly good paired with what seemed to be home-made tortilla chips.   We went there for Sunday brunch (for which they have a special menu) and although the prices are a little up there, the portions of the food are in line with the cost.

The prices may seem high at first, but the portions are very big.  We got a pork plate Cochinita Pibil for $19.75, which comes with lots of meat - the pork is so tender and so good.  On the side: tortilla wraps, their special mashed potatoes, and many zucchini slices.  We also ordered a Tacos Camaron, which comes with three of the same shrimp tacos, for $12.75.  The battered shrimp was fried just the right amount - it had just the right amount of crunch - so good.  The Horchata that we ordered was $5.50, which was Barrio's house made specialty - it came in a tall coca cola bottle that is enough for one refill.  It's a great dinner place - we will be proud to bring our out of town guests here.  Compared to our other favorite Mexican restaurant Gallo Blanco (on Clarendon), Barrio is more formal, does not have any happy hour on the weekend, seems to specialize in margaritas, and has a much bigger dinner menu.",

You know who \"they\" are- the ones that call this a bad neighborhood and whose idea of adventerous food is ordering a pasta instead of the soup/salad combo at Olive Garden for lunch.    I was pleasantly surprised at the service after everything I've read lately.  Our server was respectful of the \"business\" at the table and helpful when I couldn't make up my mind.   He pushed me to the Ensalada de Pato.  The spinach and mangos were vibrant, they didn't spare on the toasted pine nuts, the spicy naranja supremes were a pleasant surprise and roquefort cheese and queso fresco were sparingly perfect.  The roasted duck was just perfect and I was oh so happy that I was persuaded to get this salad.   I would recommend waiting until 1pm if you want to meet here and actually conduct business (it's a little too noisy otherwise).    I wish I knew our server's name- he was just right.  I'm looking forward to coming back (just not with \"them\").",

    "text": "First, let me say that I really WANTED to like Barrio Cafe and will return in the hopes that our visit was a really off night.  However, my first visit was hugely disappointing. Service was fair-to-good.  The music was great, even if misplaced. The food was a major let-down.  As others have noted, our dinner started with a bread and a sort of Mexican-inspired tapanade. It was a nice alternative to chips and salsa.  For dinner we split an order of Tacos de Tinga and then she had the Torta de Mole and I had the Cochinita Pibil. As we understand it (based on a combined 27 years of living in Mexico), tinga is usually a chicken dish cooked with either chipotles or chorizo and a LOT of onion. The sauce is created as a result of the cooking and is usually a nice mix of spicy and sweet (the sweetness coming from the onion). At Barrio Cafe, our experience was with what appeared to be chicken breast that was cooked on the grill or in a pan and then tossed in a sort of sweet sauce with no hint of either chorizo or chipotle and it was completely missing the sweet reduced onion flavor. Further, the tacos were served with a salsa that did not complement the meat at all.  My Cochinita Pibil was completely underwhelming. The achiote used was not nearly strong enough, and the meat was overcooked. Thankfully it was half-price for the restaurant's anniversary. Perhaps the full-price version actually tastes like Cochinita Pibil. It should also be noted that the pickled red-onion was lacking flavor and the puree (of potato?) was difficult to identify.  My wife's dish was equally strange. The Torta de Mole started off promising. The actual mole sauce had a nice taste to it. Unfortunately, the chicken had been cooked without the sauce (that's twice, see a trend here?) and did not have any flavor of its own. The bread the torta was served on was probably the best part of the meal. The fries (fries with a torta? OKAY) were seasoned with something we couldn't put our finger on and accompanied by a lazy ketchup that had something, maybe chipotle or achiote?  We skipped dessert. For our money, we'd rather get tacos at La Condessa or La Frontera (both on the same street).",

We only had to wait about 20 minutes before we were seated.  The restaurant was completely packed so service was a little slow, but that happens everywhere on a Friday night.  I was really looking forward to the table side guac, but that was a big disappointment, fortunately our only one.  We had it with everything in it, but our waitress didn't mash up the avocado so it was more like a diced avocado salad than creamy guac, or even close to anything you could scoop up with a chip.  For dinner I had the Pescado del Mar.  A luscious piece of halibut topped with shrimp and scallops.  I could eat this every day.  For desert we tried the churros with goats milk caramel.  If no one was looking, I would have licked the plate.  I tried a bite of the flan and it wasn't so good - cold and flavorless.  I'm looking forward to a return trip and will order the same meal.",

And the chorizo taco were good also if you enjoy chorizo.  Also tried the sangria and michelada with negro modelo which were excellent.  Lastly we had the crepes for dessert.

    "text": "I had been wanting to try this place for years, but living in chandler we don't make it up that way all too often.  Last week though my 13 year old had an ATV accident and was moved to phoenix children's hospital.  3 nights in, the bf and I were sooooo tired of the cafeteria food that we decided to duck out for a real dinner while the boy was sleeping.  A quick yelp search and I saw that Barrio Cafe was within walking distance!  Score!  So we headed out.  Now being from chandler, we were caught a little off guard as we approached the intersection of Thomas and 16th st.   We weren't in the suburbs anymore, that's for sure.  As we headed down 16th st. past the graffiti and storefronts with bars on the windows, we started wondering if we should have driven.  But then 50 ft ahead we saw the restaurant.  Yes!  We got there around 5:15 so it wasn't busy and we were seated immediately.  Cute place.  Small, charming, with a cute, but really small wood bar by the entrance.  Our waiter came by right away and recommended the Lowrider margarita so we each ordered one.  This is a very authentic tasting margarita.  Lots of tequila, a little bit of lime.  Very strong...but at $12 bucks a pop we each only needed one.  They brought out bread with an olive tapenade, I think.  Really good!  I knew I wanted to try their table side guacamole with the pomegranate seeds and I'm glad we did!  Very yummy!  Great chips too!  Our waiter made some great recommendations, but knowing we were already going to be almost full from bread and guacamole, we opted for tacos.  I had a combo order of the shrimp tacos and the halibut.  The bf got the tacos de carne asada.  Everything was fabulous!  You get 4 with each order and I had to discard the tortillas after two so I could finish them.  They come with either fries or salad.  We were confused about fries coming with tacos, but that's a Spanish thing I guess, so the bf got fries, I got salad.  Great little salad, but boy were those fries good!  They come with a chipotle ketchup and just taste great!  All in all, a great meal, and a great distraction from the stress of my son's accident.  I'd definitely like to go again and try something other than the tacos.  Btw....the boy is ok.  Recovering nicely!",

The service was top notch, coming to check on us a few times, and again...the BEST enchilada I've ever had. Amazing.  A little pricey, but it was worth it.

We had some churros to end of and they were definitely worth it! Very large, crispy and served with vanilla ice cream. The service was prompt, although the food took awhile.

The bread and bruschetta(?) nibbles while we waited were not liked by my dinner mate but it was good in my opinion. However, all was forgiven when the food arrived. My tacos (1 mushroom and the rest pork) were awesome, as was the side salad. We left fat and happy.",

The prices were a bit high for the area where the restaurant is located. The decor; poorly neglected with cholo paintings on the walls. The tables were set much too close together. The poor kid behind me kept backing into my chair. I felt like I was eating inside an old school tattoo shop or trapped in a bad episode of The Art Laboe low rider show. If you're going to have fine dining prices maybe the decor should work in synergy with the menu prices. 11.00 for a mimosa is pretty high in my opinion. Our server was nice, pleasant and attentive. I'm a native, first time here, and we will not be back. Overrated, overpriced and a disappointment.",

OMG this is how they should be serving the dish in the first place! It was incredible. All of the staff are super accommodating and friendly you can really tell that they all love their jobs. But the host is actually the one who tipped the scales on our visit!  We then had tacos again the host could tell we really appreciate good food and decided to bring us out a plate of the family meal made only for staff that night. He had said it was the best family meal he has ever had and it was far and away the best dish we got to have. Everything was well thought out and the food was amazing. The cocktails are a must! Also the coffee is an incredible value! If you go you will not be disappointed. We will most definitely be back during our next visit to Arizona.",

First of all you need to go into it from a back parking lot into a door that was not signed very well to know to use it. The dining room area is very small and noisy. If you want an intimate place to chat over your meal,this is NOT THE PLACE  !  With all the awards and positive things we had heard about the taste of the food and etc,we were disappointed. Either we didn't order the items on the menu that qualified for such awards or it isn't the way they say it is.  The server was nice,but didn't come back too often to check out our need for drink refills and etc. We were there for the lunch time. We noticed the cost of the dinner items,they along with others were very pricy. This place isn't located in an area of Phoenix where this pricing is justified. If in Scottsdale or other equivalent areas, then possibly but not at this restaurant. We will NEVER RETURN to this place. SAVE YOUR MONEY ! This place serves food that tastes like those of the \"run of the mill\" type Hispanic restaurants that dot the landscape of Phoenix and surrounding areas  !!",

All the great reviews, I've had many people tell me to go there, and to top it all off the chef was nominated for a James beard award this year. I have been in this industry for a long time and know what an honor it is to even be nominated for this prestigious award.  I'll start with the good... our busser was awesome and if I wasn't in corporate dining now I would of done everything I could to poach him from this wretched place. Also the limes that came with my taco were really juicy and some of the best I've ever had. But I guess  we have mother nature to thank for that not this place. Yes I just added that the limes were good in this review if that tells you anything.   Now I don't really know where to begin from here but here it goes... how in the actual fuck can you call this place authentic Mexican food. Taco bell is more authentic than this sad excuse of a restaurant. No beans? No rice? No chips and salsa? Really?!? Bread and olive tepanade?!? Yes you read that right ladies and gentalmen.   Tacos served with FRENCH FRIES?!? The pork was dry and seriously lacked flavor I don't know how you fuck up braised pork but they sure seemed to figure it out. The tortillas fucking blew. And it was all slopped on The fucking plate with sauce finger prints all over The rim of The plate. Have some fucking pride in your job and wipe the rim of the plate before you send it out you lazy asses. The enchiladas suizas were the most pathetic thing I have ever seen. It looked like a bowl of Alfredo. Dry cubes of chicken breast, some shit poor white sauce wrapped up in the poorest excuse for tortillas I have ever seen mounded with cheese and looked like the shoved that shit in the microwave. Served with a side of zucchini topped with a sprinkle of corn. (The corn made it mexican...) and all for the grand old price of $19 and fucking $12 for chips and guac... Are you serious right now. What did President Enrique Pena nieto grow and pick those mother fuckers him damn self. I really think this is place is disrespectful to Mexican culture and cuisine. It really worries me that this is the chefs interpretation of Mexican food and that this is what she was nominated for in this year's James beard awards. This is  Sad! Just sad! Needless to say I will not be returning.",

It was a generous portion of panseared chicken breast, moist and flavorful, with an incredible tomatillo buerre blanc sauce that honestly made me want to lick the plate. The hubs enjoyed the acclaimed pork tacos, Cochinita Pibil, which featured a subtle complexity of flavors that was truly enjoyable... the kind of taste sensation that makes you rave after each bite. They have a great selection of Mexican beers, but the highlight of my night was the organic margarita recommended by our server. Unlike those coyingly  sweet/sour concoctions you often find passed off as margaritas, this one featured fresh citrus juices and the notable kick of a top-quality tequila. One was enough!

Even I was eyeballing photos of the famous Chiles en Nogada dish and was getting excited.  The outside of this building is covered with several crazy and colorfully painted murals. They are very psychedelic and most interesting. Inside is decorated in a similar way and has paintings of the same type of art on the walls.  We started with the table side Guacamole that everyone raves about. Guess we missed the fine print and it came straight from the kitchen. The guacamole was pretty good. But not enough to give it a $12 price tag. Not sure why they put cranberries in there. Maybe not the best match for such a dish.  Tried ordering their famous Chiles en Nogada and was told that it is a seasonal dish. They said that pomegranate was not available and they did not have the ingredients. Why put it on the menu if you do not serve it at all times? Maybe start by putting SEASONAL next to the item so that everyone knows up front.  Ordered the Pollo Poblano instead and was not very impressed. Daughter ordered the Cochinita Pibil and said it was very tender. She also said that it lacked any deep flavors and was not very exciting. My wife and son in law decided to go with the Fish Tacos. Both dishes looked really good. Again they fell short on taste as well.  Service was friendly and the atmosphere was pleasant. Other reviews also generally mention that this restaurant is not the same as it used to be. We thought the food was more or less A-OK with prices that were higher than desired.  Maybe it is time for a kitchen intervention or something. Give them a try and see what you think. Everyone has a different idea of what GREAT taste like these days. LO SIENTO!  2.75 STARS",

I have never seen anything like it. In addition, they were out of potato for the evening (at 8 o'clock) and everything came out luke warm. However, the salad was good... but I don't consider that Mexican. But hey! ...to each their own.",

    "text": "Had read so many articles about the creative styling of Mexican food. Took my mom and son for lunch and asked the waiter how the Conchinita Pibil was. He explained how the pork was slow roasted and delish. I got the sandwich and mom got the tacos.   Wow....must have been the least tasty thing I've ever had in my mouth. I swear to Buddha, the first thought that crossed my mind at first bite was Spam! But then I thought, hey I've had really good spam at Keilanis in San Diego.  Suffice to say, neither my mom or I finished the meal. I think I took 2 bites and was done.  Regarding my son's chicken: I asked if they could make some plain boiled chicken and no spices. When the plate came out the side of fries was coated with their signature spice. The waiter assured me it wasn't that hot. Helloooo, we're talking about a 4 yr old child! Even I ate the fries and my mouth was tingling.  We sent it back. By the time the new dish had arrived, my son was cranky and wanted to go home. Guess they can't rush a plain chicken and fries dish.  We won't be going back.",

As I entered I was told by a not so courteous girl (she seemed to be new and not very good with people) that it would be at least 45 min to and hour wait. As the place is small but interesting we decided to wait it out. Finally after 45 minutes they called us. We got seated to a small table with artsy chairs and table, the place is interesting because of the Mexican artsy objects. The waiter was very nice and the menu looked promising , everything in the menu was very pricy but we figured the meals would make up for the high prices. My wife ordered enchiladas suizas and i ordered enchiladas with black mole. When the meals arrived I immediately noticed there where no rice and beans , and I thought to myself seriously ?? Really ?? I asked the waiter if I could order 2 side orders of rice for our meals and he said \"oh we don't have rice and beans.  I was stunned because normally all mexican restaurants serve rice and beans with the meals.  But we were so hungry that we accepted it because we have waited to long to eat. The food was good but it didn't satisfy my hunger , each plate was $22 and for that price I would have got a killer meal at and upscale Mexican restaurant with all the bells and whistles , so therefore we do not recommend  this place very pricey and not worth the wait. It's a cute place but not worth the money. After paying $67 I was still hungry",

Not ok. And it took 40mins to get our meal to the table which was sloppy.  My friend's tacos didn't have sauce on them or slices of avocado like mine, and the waiter, who was nice, didn't show up to the table to check on us.  He forgot my other friend's drink and never brought it...it was a mess. I will say however, their guac is pretty delicious.  Would I go back?  Honestly, no.",

Seriously - heaven on earth.  And, I will make an argument that it has to be somewhat nutritional?   I mean, there's cinnamon and milk - aren't those two items good for the skin and heart? :)  I could eat this every day and wouldn't even mind if I got fat because I'd be so happy.    The dinner and lunches have been pretty good as well -  I'd recommend Sunday brunch as the best time to go - it's not as crowded and they have a unique brunch menu.  Plus, you can still get the churro dessert at 11:30am and have the whole rest of your day to walk it off.   :)   Great place to take out-of-towners as it's been nationally recognized in several top publications.",

The only issue I had with Barrio was the lack of space.  I literally had to shout to get my voice over the roar of the crowd.  Everything is packed so tight, I had to dodge waiters with trays and other customers coming and going while attempting to eat without turning myself into a cyclops with the fork.  When it's too crowded, I would often sedate myself with a tasty sangria from the bar.  But heaven forfend if you'd like to sit there.  Nope, there just happens to be at least 15 people packed into a 4' by 10' space, waiting for tables.  The food and drink is delicious, but I took away 1 star for feeling like I was in a NYC bar in downtown Phoenix.",

We literally waited about 5 min to be greeted by the server and another 15-20 to get our drinks, which had to be brewed. Given it was good coffee and tea, but 20 minutes to get a drink on the table is silly.  You have to ask for water, as they dont serve it automatically, and the bread and tapanade came well before the drinks.  The tapanade and bread was pretty damn good. I ordered the Carne Asada Tacos, and they were very fresh tasting, but rather flavorless otherwise.  It came with a nice salad with cranberries, which was pretty good. The food was good, but not great.  The freshness factor was the most distinguishable flavor.  It would have been amazing if it were fresh and tasty. The server was just fine, and it was mod-high-mod for lunch price wise.",

But naive me realized the entrees and guacamole are where it's at. Any time I have guests willing to shell out a bit more for a meal, I always stop here. There's usually a wait of about an hour, in that tiny restaurant, but it's worth it. Their homemade pomegranate seed guacamole (cranberries when pomengranate is off season) is a must. And I love how instead of chips and salsa on the tables, staff bring pieces of bread with this oiive tapenade. I have never had a bad thing here, from the tortas to their duck. If I could afford it, I'd eat there once a week 'til I conquered the entire menu. On weekends, they have live music which adds to the already casual, urban atmosphere. I once went to a cooking demo with chef/owner Silvana. That lady knows her stuff!",

    "text": "I just read the last review by Mike and I want to second his comment about the defects of Barrio. The prices are definitely higher than what I am used to for dinner and the portions could be seen as small. We went after having some chips and guacamole as snacks at my house knowing the wait for a table would be over an hour (we were warned ahead of time by several people that we would have to wait, especially on a Saturday night). We sat outside on some benches and watched as three groups of people came and left due to the wait. We were seated in less time that quoted which is always a nice surprise. The waiter was very busy with all of his tables and we felt that he could have used some help. The fresh guacamole we ordered was supposed to be made at the table, but because we were seated in a corner surrounded by other tables, he made it in front of the other tables and brought it to us. That was very disappointing as I felt he really did not make an effort to provide us with the entertainment that the guacamole making provides. The food arrived in the expected time and was just right to eat. Each of us ordered a different taco plate and shared the meal which was fun to get to sample each meat. I ordered the pork knowing that it was delicious and I was very satisfied by the texture and flavor. I recommend that dish for anyone who goes to the Cafe. We finished the meal with a shared portion of the churro and ice cream dessert. Very satisfying. I will go back again, but not anytime soon.",

    "text": "I'm not your typical clueless reviewer in Phoenix who thinks anything that is decent is worth 5 stars. At the same time, I'm reasonable and I don't compare everything to New York restaurants, I grade relatively meaning relative to Phoenix area.  Okay, so this place is incredibly hyped. The food is outrageously expensive. I know what you are thinking \"Well this guy is cheap a$# and unlike him, I'm willing to pay for good food\" Yeah, I am not that guy either and I'm willing to pay for good food too  but when 3 people have lunch and your bill ends up being over $150 for some small enchiladas and a few margaritas, you soon realize the owners are banking on its hype and jacking up those prices just for the heII of it.  The reason Barrio Cafe is popular is simple. Phoenix has mostly chain restaurants. This is one of the few unique restaurants.  And it's not lard factory like many Mexican restaurants in the valley. You know the type of restaurant i'm talking about; the all Mexican owned and worked joint that puts lard in everything and it tastes delicious until you realize their menu isn't that different from Taco Bell aside from the lard, the mariachi music and the Dos Equis sitting in my hand. But I digress.....this place is another trendy flamboyant (read Gay) owned restaurant that serves good drinks, offers trendy waiters that pretend they are the food version of a Sommelier and act like they have a PhD in food and know so much more about chicken enchiladas than you do, so for the average Joe white dude in Phoenix, they are impressed by this. Lastly, the wait fools you. The place is tiny with no parking. Obviously, there are going to be wait times and seating issues but it really fools the first time customer into thinking the place must be amazing.  Bottomline: this place needs to drop its prices and the attitude and serve bigger portions.  And by bigger portions, I'm reasonable, I'm not Fred from Golden Corral expecting massive portions that can feed 3 people, but when 2 or 3 of their enchiladas combined  are smaller than a bean burrito from taco bell, you know someone is pinching pennies in the back.  The service also needs to improve.  Our waitress totally botched our order, and brought the wrong dish. No she didn't mistake our order with another table's, she just outright messed up but didn't apologize...and this is a big deal here because they take so long to bring your food out in the first place.",

Also, no chips and salse, instead bread and tapanade.  That loses some points, but the fish tacos and other food make up for it.  Desserts are so-so, but mexican dessert isn't really my thing.",

The margarita was expensive but it was strong and one of the best I have ever had. It didn't bug me that they served bread and tapenade instead of chips and salsa. I found the change refreshing and the tapenade was delish! We ordered guacamole while we decided what we wanted to eat. I didn't like the pomegranates in the guacamole and I had to salt it up a bit. We also ordered some fundido dip that was almost cold when we dipped into it. We asked for them to reheat it and I noticed they guy sitting next to us sent back his seafood dish for the same reason.....wasn't cooked well enough. You shouldn't be having these problems when you are paying an arm and a leg for your meal. I ordered the surf and turf for $46 dollars. It came with filet mignon topped with chorizo and goat cheese on top of mashed potatoes and a lobster tail. It was good but they undercooked my steak and the lobster tail didn't taste like it was as fresh as the waiter described. He said they fly in the seafood fresh daily. Even though the food is really good it is way overpriced. I would rather eat at Gallo Blanco for half the price.",

Although it feels inexpensive based on the location and the atmosphere, the food is upscale. Tapenade at beginning of meal fine, but I've made better. House margarita is $8, but very good. Server was okay, but not overly friendly. Halibut was on special with a lobster tail and some shrimp, for $35. Can't beat that. Halibut a little overdone. My husband had some type of torta, but the bread was HUGE and very dense, so he was little disappointed. Not what he was expecting, but said it was delicious. Lots of choices, and everyone seemed to be enjoying their meals. I would come back.",

The negatives:  high pricing for portion size, weak but ridiculously expensive drinks for the area, a menu that didn't offer many adventuresome dishes.  The restaurant is extremely loud... small quarters with stone walls and you couldn't hear any dinner conversation.  Service is OK, but no one is overly friendly.  Art on the wall is nice, but looks like it was done by an elementary school kid yet has $500 price tags.",

    "text": "Over two years in Phoenix and my first dinner at Barrio still stands as my best meal since arrival.  Started with the house margarita, which was great.  Also have tried the Organic Margarita, and it is spectacular.  Decide how much you feel like spending and order accordingly, there is no wrong answer to this question.  Except maybe \"No thanks\".  I shared the Chiles en Nogada and the Pescado del Mar.  I can't pick a favorite, possibly due to the brain damage from the firestorm of joy transmitted from tongue to pleasure center.  Chiles en Nogada is a twist on the classic Chile Relleno, they start with a large fresh poblano pepper, stuff it with chicken, onions, garlic, pecans, apples, and I seem to recall pomegranate and angel dust, then top it with an absurdly tasty almond cream sauce.  Pescado del Mar is pan roasted halibut sort of stuffed/topped with crab, shrimp, lobster, and scallops, finished off with chorizo and another different, obnoxiously good cream sauce.  For dessert, absolutely get the churros.  Do remember the little cinnamon sticks that the word churro implies, but imagine them expertly prepared, stuffed with goats milk caramel and vanilla bean ice cream.  Service was friendly and efficient, the wait was long, but that was expected.  The Sunday brunch is also very much worth checking out, particularly for the seafood crepes.  My only disappointment from El Barrio so far was my own fault.  I didn't feel like waiting for a table and made the mistake of chosing Fish Tacos for a to-go order.  The shelf life on fish tacos is not long.  By the time I got home, we had a Captain Crunch enemy standoff going.  (Soggies...if you needed the clarification)",

Most people who are only famliar with Americanized Mexican food will not understand what is going on here. And those haters out there that think Mexican cuisine cannot be a fine dining experience, you can keep your 2 for 1 tacos made from questionable meat sources. If you'v visited different regions in Mexico besides Baja, Rocky Point and Cancun, you'll appreciate the regional dishes at this restaurant and the inventive use of ingredients and crazy flavors. The Chiles en Nogada and the Pato en Tamarindo are my favs. And with over 200 tequilas to taste, I look forward to tryng something new every visit.",

    "text": "I have been fortunate lately because most places that I've taken the time to eat at have been very good.  This place is no exception.  Great authentic Mexican food.  I had slow roasted pork tacos with incredible fries and chipotle ketchup.  Simple but great food.  The pork tacos were very tender and had just the right amount of spice.  My wife had an avocado, mango, shrimp, tomato salad with a vinegarette.  It was very tasty.  Again, simple and fresh.  This is the only place in the valley we've been where they can actually make a margarita correctly.  If you've ever been to Mexico they typically use quality tequila, fresh sqeezed lime juice, and and orange liquor (triple sec, cointreau).  The bartender here makes them just like that, no disgusting sweet and sour or other sweet juices.  You should be able to taste the tequila and just because there is tequila in the drink doesn't mean you're going to turn into a raging drunk and black out.  If you drink enough of anything that will happen.  A good 100% agave tequila adds flavor.  Try it you might like it.  He also gave us a great idea for making margarita's with tequila, lime, and a little agave syrup.  Cool guy and great idea.  You can buy agave syrup at trader joe's or fresh n easy.  We use 2 shots of tequila, 1 shot fresh lime juice, and 3/4 shot triple sec or cointreau.  However, instead of the triple sec or cointreau I am going to try 1 big teaspoon of the agave syrup.  Should be good.",

Order the Torta de Mole Negro.  It's the same thing but served as a sandwich with fries and a delicious chipotle-kissed ketchup or a small salad.

A close friend rants and raves about cochinita pibil in old town San Diego so when I noticed this dish in the reviews we had to try it. We started with a jamaica margarita which was delicious, not too sweet, refreshing and potent, perfect.     The bread with olive tapenade hit the spot as well. My dish which was the poblano torta had a great combination of flavors. The cochinita pibil was just ok and the steak fries that came with it were too salty for our taste. Don't know if this is the norm or if they just happen to go a bit shaker happy on this occasion. We decided the place was way overpriced for the food offered. Thanks for the experience and authentic artsy decor.",

    "text": "A friend from work recommended this place to me as one of the \"TOP\" taco restaurants in the valley... so I decided to take my boyfriend here for a date.  First of all, parking is small. We had to park on the side street and walk up to the restaurant. Inside was really cute - there were Spanish/Skull like paintings. There was live music.. which was REALLY loud. We had to wait for about 25 minutes for a table, but meanwhile we grabbed a drink at the bar. Now the drinks are pricey, but the Chata was absolutely delicoious! It was horchata and kahlua. Andy had a frozen mango margarita.. which was also pretty good. AND there goes $28 on drinks.  After a while, we were taken back to our table... our waiter HUGO was not so welcoming. I asked for a water and didn't get it until dinner was served. We did order the guacamole which was very good especially with the pomegranate seeds. The chips and salsa were tasty, but the bread was cold which was eh. We then order our food.. I got the Suizas enchiladas with the longaniza chorizo and Andy ordered Chile tacos (make sure to ask for your salad or fries that it comes with). Our food came out and I had to ask for our water.. Hugo had forgot. I then remembered that the tacos are supposed to come with a side. So I asked and out waiter said,\"No, just the tacos.\" As soon as we were done eating, which btw was very tasty (love the gilled chicken in the enchiladas), I asked for a menu so we can take a look at \"desserts.\" I really wanted to see if the tacos came with that side .... and sure enough, IT DOES! I was so upset. We told Hugo we were ok and ready for the check.. not to mention he never came to check on us or ask us how the food was. As soon as we paid, he took the check book without saying thank you or anything! We walk out and the manager, Julio, kindly smiles and says goodbye, but I make sure to tell him about our experience there. Great food, horrible service. He apologized and offered us a free dinner on our next visit. I guess we'll go back but only because we get a free dinner. Cute little spot but Hugo sucks.   You expect quality customer service for the price you pay.. that's the only complaint I really had.",

Then we finally made it there when my brother was in town recently. The food was generally excellent all around (including the famous guac), but I felt like it belonged in a resort setting or something of the sort. Very accessible menu, pleasant service, and fun space.... but I would personally prefer getting the same styled cuisine from somewhere without the white table cloth, without the loud musician, and at much lower prices. It just seemed strange to me in some way that I can't quite identify. So I guess I'll keep bringing out of town guests, but otherwise stick with my favorite hole-in-the-wall places for the most part.

    "text": "After the Arizona Republic dubbed Barrio's Cafe the #1 Mexican Restaurant in the city we found it only fitting to do some investigating.  What we found was this small, family-owned spot is a diamond in the rough neighborhood of 16th St. & downtown Phoenix.    From the windows to the walls smothered in abstract skull artwork and religious memorobilia this awnry shrinery has a character that intriques even non-believers.    With an hour and a half wait-to-be-seated promise, we entertained (but only for a moment) bouncing to another restaurant which we could have only expected a quicker, more mediocre fare.  However, that thought was vetoed immediately after spotting an article (image included) of their famous and oh so decadent goat milk caramel, candied walnut churros dish.  Worth the weight (pun intended).  Eyes on the prize, my dining companions decided drinks were in order, a round of cervezas and margaritas later we found ourselves waiting impatiently on the patio, a new addition to this establishment. During our wait we ordered chips and guacamole, of course this wasn't your typical guacamole.  The crunchy pomegranate kick with an easy on the taste buds flavor had us wishing the bowl was bottomless.    We were seated after our second round and couldn't have been more blessed with our table's location.  The table was only inches from Sonan, a Rumba Flamenca RnB band with an ambiance and sound of Mexico City this band blew our slightly buzzed party away.  You could hear a pin drop after we all opened our menu's, the immense concentration and eye sparkles were indicators that sharing entrees was inevitable.    I could sit here and list the entree's that we inhaled, but each item had a unique, can't quite put your finger on it taste that words wouldn't do them justice.  The tequila options were just as gratifying as the dishes themselves, and the dessert menu descriptors would make even a full person's mouth water.    If you haven't already visited Barrio's Cafe, I strongly recommend you do.  As a self-proclaimed foodie, full-time tweeter and avid Yelper - I know you will be raving all the way home.",

    "text": "NOPE. not so much.   I LOVE mexican food. And as soon as I saw modern mexican food on the sign (cause it wasn't really in anyones reviews) I paused....the majority of the time, modern mexican food means bland and annoyingly different. BUT I was already there and I had dinner plans. I got two 'La Margarita' which is there 8 dollar house margarita, these were pretty good so we started off well. I like the bread and spread that they offered on the table (you need a filler while you wait for your food). Not sure I would classify that mexican at all (just because you have olivas doesn't make it mexican, and in all truth it was more like tapas) but I liked it. The waiter was pretty attentive in the beginning so that was appreciated. We ordered our food with a couple suggestions.   I originally was going for la torta de pollo y jaiba, but honestly i don't want to pay $15 to each a sandwich. Soooooo, I quickly picked an oldie but a goodie (maybe that was my mistake) the tacos de carne asada. My friend ordered some spicy sweet chicken tacos (i'm not sure exactly about the name). Our food really did take quite a while to come out, but when you have good company sometimes thats ok. They did get me a second drink during that time, once again thanks :).   When i got my food, i was really surprised that they served me french fries.... 15 bucks for a plate and i got french fries (MODERN?) Ok no big deal, i asked for some mayonesa or hollandaise sauce, thats when the service went down. I was done with 3 tacos and all my fries by the time he walked by us and I had to ask for it again... He never checked to see if everything was going well. I think thats a must and i just started to feel irritated with him at that point  And then there were 4 tacos. Small tacos, corn tortillas, with cilantro and onion. BLAND, just fucking BLAND. I couldn't believe it. I had sadly previously read a review of this restaurant that said the same thing! QUE TONTA FUI YO. I felt so stupid. I ate them....but what the F***. How are you going to make carne asada with NO flavor. My company never commented on liking their dish or not, only at the end to say it was very spicy.   I might go back and try something else, maybe something more 'modern'. BUT it will most likely be if someone else is paying. I could have gotten a better plate of the same thing from a hole in the wall mexican restaurant for $4 dollars.   No Thanks",

    "text": "Great atmosphere - small restaurant with great local art on the walls (that constantly changes).  Fast service - once you get a table.  I almost always go during the week, because it's quieter and you get seated quickly.  The food is Southern Mexican, which means it has a more subtle spice, very flavorful, and isn't overloaded with cheese.  (Yay!)  Guacamole is delicious.  There isn't a lot I can eat (I'm a lactose intolerant pescatarian) and they took my favourite dish off the menu (the pescado veracruzano... it was truly amazing), but I go for experience.  I usually get the shrimp or fish tacos, which are great.  Sometimes I get the tilapia wrapped in a banana leaf, but it's a little pricey.   Great restaurant for small groups.  I would come more often, but their menu hasn't changed much over the last 5 years and I wish it would.  Barrio has received well-deserved lavish praise for years and now it kind of feels like it's just coasting.  Definitely worth trying.",

    "text": "After seeing Barrio Cafe on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives we decided to check it out while we were in Phoenix for the day. We must have arrived right after the lunch rush hour, so we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. At this time on Saturday afternoon, there was happy hour so my husband went for 2 for 1 beers (Negro Modelo), while I went for the house-made horchata. It comes in a medio litro bottle and I almost finished the entire thing. Very good! For a starter we ordered the Queso Fundido, which had some loganiza chorizo in it which gave it a nice flavor. For our entrees we tried the Cochinita Pibil and Chiles en Nogada. I enjoyed my Chiles en Nogada becuase of the sweet and savory flavors, but it didn't blow me away as I thought it would. My husband's cochinita pibil was tender, but since he knows the secret to making pork like that he was also underwhelmed. While everything tasted good, we had higher expectations and thought that the prices were a bit expensive for what you get. That being said, I would go again to give some other items on the menu a try and see if I still feel the same way about the place.",

We stood in the parking lot until 11 at which time my sister walked in to see if we could be seated.  She was promptly escorted back out the door having been told they were not open yet.  After 5 more minutes of standing in the parking lot we decided to leave.  I walked in to tell them that they had lost our business.  The staff's only response?  \"Well, if you care to wait we'll be open in a few minutes\".  Incredibly poor customer service.  You never, EVER leave customers standing outside.  Is the food good?  We'll never know as I certainly won't try them again.  My suggestion?  Head around the corner to Juan's instead (we did!).

I went to this restaurant with a coworker that saw it on TV and she raved about the Guacamole that had pomegranate seeds in it and I thought to myself.. \"Here we go, another failed attempt at Mexican food.\"   I was so wrong, I had the guacamole and although the pomegranate seeds were in there this tasted like an authentic dish. So from there I went all in.  I also had the Chiles en Nogad, mainly because I like apricots and was curious about how it was all going to work. I can tell you that was one of best plates I've had. Everyone ordered different foods and no one was disappointed.  The service was fast and most of all pleasant and my coworker earned exponential cool points for picking this restaurant. Chef I salute you!",

Barrio Cafe is not for everyone. If you have no sense of adventure or want standard fare, go to a chain or a drive-through. Want something different, yet absolutely delicious? Come here with an open mind and try as many different things as you can.",

We waited 45 min for a table, not unusual!!!  It was busy, but very understaffed. The nacho chips were stale. I told the waiter and he brought new ones, again stale. It took very long to order. The entrees were delicious but a dinner that takes 2 hours when it should have been much less, was torture especially with 2 children. Never was able to have my second margarita bc of the poor service. Bus boy never cleared our table. When we finally asked for the check it took so long to get it and even then it took 3 different try's to get a check that even resembled what we had ordered. Finally gave up and paid the $7 more than what it should have been. YIKES never again, at least not during peak hours. Advice to the owner :  invest in more waiters.",

Let me just say Richard is fantastic.   Kinda over did it on the food, appetizer stuffed jalapenos- great.  Then the pozole-fantasti.  Went for a double main,  the filet and the Verde enchiladas.  The file cane with a red and red wine reduction sauce jalapeno mad and calabasas or zucchini wowsa. The verde enchiladas had grilled tortillas and a wonderful sauce.  Topped it off with the vanilla stuffed churros with ice cream, Carmel and whipped cream.    The food was wonderful, really busy now during the season.  Will be back want to try the brunch.  Definitely will be back again.",

    "text": "Awesome food, love the murals, love the ambience, though the wait was a little long and there were two sizable flies hanging out on the window next to us that made me feel like someone in the vicinity was listening in on our conversation (I may have been binge-watching Ray Donovan recently, maybe).  We came out here for a celebratory lunch, were seated almost immediately, our waitress gave us a quick rundown of the popular menu items which was much appreciated since some of us were new to Barrio Cafe.  The choices were vast, and I was so torn between several menu items I ended up just going with the first thing that came to mind when the waitress asked for my order.  I wound up with the filetitto torta which was really reasonably priced ($16).  This is going to sound rather odd but I really appreciate the range of prices of their menu items.  You have things that are in the low teens, and some that go into the high twenties, making it accessible for people who are on a budget (like yours truly) and people coming in for special occasions such as anniversaries, birthdays, and the like.  The torta was amazing.  Huge piece of meat, topped with chorizo and I'm not sure what else cause I was too busy wolfing it down.  It looked glorious, for the short time it was on my plate.  I regret getting their spicy fries, not because they weren't good but because the salad looked so much better - I don't remember exactly what was in it (the dried cranberries did catch my eye), but it was definitely not your regular house salad.  My boss ordered the carne asada tacos which I actually almost ordered but am glad I didn't.  I guess they weren't quite as good since the response I got to \"how were the tacos?\" was \"they weren't as good as yours looked\".  My only gripe was that it seemed like we were waiting for our food for quite a while but maybe our order just took a little longer to cook so I'm not too bothered by that.  I'm definitely ordering their crepes next time I stop by cause damn, did they look good.  Pretty much all of us were eyeing the neighboring table's dessert the minute it came out, I'm not even kidding.  Maybe I'll just order that crepe as my main course.  Nope, I need to have that torta again. Or maybe try something new.  Hmm.",

The La Picocita Margarita, Arbol chili infused margarita was one of the most delicious cocktails that I have ever had. Simply wonderful.   The bread and peppers that they put on the table was outstanding. The bread was crusty on the outside and soft on the inside, not unlike a french bagette in New Orleans.   Pomegrante Guacomole was excellent. The poms added a nice texture and wend very well with the perfectly ripe avocado. I would have preferred that it was a little less \"rustic\" but the application of a fork made it perfect.  My lovely bride was very happy with her chicken suiza. It was well constructed and a solid dish.  My Del Mar was a little overcooked and I found the creme sauce a little flat.   My dish notwithstanding, it was an excellent dining experience.",

The fish was perfectly cooked, and the hibiscus sauce flavorful and addictive. The spicy mash accompaniment was just ok. The fresh brewed iced tea was wonderful. The olive tapanade with the bread was great as well. My husband had the carne asada tacos, which were ok. For a local, this is a special occasion type of place.

Driving past the front door, which faces 16th St, I concluded parking must be in the back... which there was... just none for me... so I settled on the questionable lot on the north side of Edgemont... you know, where they filmed The Warriors?  It's ok, I'm totes insured.  So, I fabricate my best hardened criminal scowl, gangsta-strolled up to the front door, lean like a cholo, and announce that I require accommodations for uno.  That's Mexican for solo.  The hostess looks me up and down, and that's when I remembered I was wearing my Disneyland Resort shirt with the adorable Mickey Mouse arm patch.  Son-of-a-nutcracker!  Luckily, I got the best seat in the house, right at the end of the bar by the entrance, where no less than 47 people came to order their drinks while waiting to be seated.  This is the first \"Mexican\" restaurant where I was served a sliced french loaf and tapenade.  I started out with the Esquites, which is a delectable myriad of buttered roasted corn, chipotle cream, cotija cheese with cilantro and lime, served in a petite martini glass.  YES, this is the way a civilized person enjoys elote.  For the main course, I decided on Chile Colorado, which is a grilled bone-in pork chop smothered in a dark chile and red wine reduction, paired with a spicy mashed potato and grilled zucchini (half of which were cooked perfectly)  Since I was in such a high-profile seat, I thought I'd treat the clientele to a big boy eating a massive dessert, with my very large plate of dos churros floating atop a lake of caramel near a glacier of vanilla bean ice cream.  It was a winter wonderland on my plate.  Four people could have comfortably split this, but I was there to give the performance of a lifetime, and somewhere during Act 3, I spoon-fed the last morsel into the black hole perched precariously above my chin.  In today's match-up... MAN WINS!  I love people, and my bar-stool accommodations allowed me to chat with a seemingly never-ending stream of patrons.  I was walking people through the menu, suggesting specific pre-dinner drinks (lowrider) and regaling them with my quips. My big hit of the evening seemed to be \"Wow, it appears y'all missed the happy hour pricing\".  That one killed them all... especially the young couple who was charged $27.23 for 2 Modelos and 2 lime flavored tequila shots.  Barrio Cafe is spendy.  The entree was overpriced, but the appetizer and dessert were well worth the fare.  Sure, my tab could have fed a village in Sri Lanka for a month, but I don't know anyone there.",

    "text": "\"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\" is a pretty accurate summary. I'm currently living in Seattle, where the Mexican food tends to be horrendous, so Mexican is the first thing that is on my list when I'm visiting Phoenix (obviously). We came here based on a recommendation, and without doing my research, I walked in expecting the stereotypical type of burrito, carne asada fries, quesadilla thing where there is fluorescent lighting everywhere. Wrong. But I was so pleased to be wrong. I mean, they have quesadillas, tacos, and burritos on the menu, but it's not like that. This place is a real-deal culinary experience. The flavors had depth, and I left with a good mouth-feel. We wanted the cochinita pibil (slow cooked pork), but we had time-constraints, and our server was very helpful in letting us know that might stress us out because it takes a while to make, so we ordered the pollo poblano (and a few other things), and wow. This place has changed my perceptions of what Phoenix has to offer. I'm coming back and making sure that I have enough time to try the cochinita pibil. Just. Wow.",

    "text": "My wife and I saw the restaurant on a replay of an episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives yesterday. Neither us had been there before so we decided to make a trip today. Parking is in the back and has several available spots. It is along an alley which has a lot of excellent murals painted on the walls. I highly recommend a walk after the meal to check them out and work off a little of the food.   No chips and salsa in this Mexican restaurant. Instead it is a plate of fresh bread and a tapenade. I saw one review mention it was very salty, and usually everything tastes salty to me. I didn't notice it here. It tasted mostly like pimentos to me. My wife did not like it, but I enjoyed it.  She ordered the Chiles en Nogada, which was a roasted poblano pepper stuffed with chicken, apple, pear, dried apricot and pecans. It was in an almond cream sauce and the plate had some pomegranate seeds as well. She enjoyed it and I was able to negotiate a couple of bites as well. The sauce was creamy and a nice balance to the fruits inside the pepper.   I ordered Cochinita Pibil which was pork marinated in achiote and sour orange, wrapped in a banana leaf and slow roasted overnight. On top of that was pickled red onion and Yucatan-style pico de gallo. The pork was the size of a Sunday pork roast and the banana made it so tender it fell apart at the touch of a fork. I'm a big guy and I couldn't finish half of it - fortunately a box home held the rest.   The one thing that might be surprising was the price. It was a little more expensive than I thought when I walked in. I thought maybe $10-$12 per plate, but both of ours were over $20. The bill for the two entrees and a fountain coke (my wife had water) was $51.00. But it was very good and definitely worth it. I would like to try the horchata, which the menu states is award-winning.  So it sounds like a repeat trip will be necessary.",

He also tried to tell us not to order the lower priced tacos.  In hindsight I think he was trying to pad his bill because he knows it's included with the bill.",

    "text": "My friend was craving authentic Mexican food, so we stumbled across Barrio Cafe as being one of the highest rated Mexican restaurants in the area. I believe that the Barrio Cafe specializes in Yucatan Peninsula-style Mexican cuisine. First things I noticed were the amazing Dia De Los Meurtos murals all around the restaurant. You can see the restaurant painted with the traditional imagery, and the murals are all over the back lot. The restaurant had a wonderful ambiance. We came in during the lunch hour, and I was pleasantly surprised to walk in to a live performance of a man playing the Spanish guitar. He played beautifully! I ordered the Pescado tacos (fish tacos), and I got to try my friend's Cochinita Pibil tacos and my other friend's Chilaquiles red mole.   I absolutely LOVED my fish tacos. The fish were perfectly battered, and all the cream sauces and flavors complimented the fish tacos very well. I'd even say that Barrio Cafe's fish tacos are on my top 3 list of the best fish tacos I'd ever have. I ordered the side salad to go along with my tacos. My salad came with mixed greens, cotija cheese, cranberries, pico de gallo, and a balsamic vinaigrette. As simple as my salad was, it was delicious as well.  Barrio Cafe's Cochinita Pibul tacos are excellent! The Cochinita Pibul is prepared by slow roasting pork overnight in a banana leaf with sour orange and achiote (some type of Mayan spice). You can definitely taste the tanginess in the pork from the sour orange.   I thought my friend's Chilaquiles with red mole was good too. The mole wasn't overly sweet as most moles taste to me since they're made with chocolate, and the mole had a nice smokiness to it.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were really looking forward to finally trying Barrio Cafe after having it bookmarked for months.   I have to start off by saying that I was so surprised at how pricey the food was. However, I thought maybe the taste would compensate for the steep price. That was not the case. $15 for a plate of 3 tacos with only a salad OR fries? No rice or beans? Please, get over your expensive prices. The amount of food is not worth the money. The Cameron and pork tacos were not bad, but I could get 2-3 dozen of similar tasting tacos for the $30 I paid at another Mexican restaurant or taco stand.  The horchata was good, almost as good as the horchata I would drink in Mexico but also 4 times the price. $5.50 a bottle lol  I'm Mexican and grew up eating Mexican food, so I know the food here is good. But it is not $15-$20 a plate good. I'm still baffled at how people are willing to pay so much for average Mexican food.  2 plates of tacos and 1 horchata was $35. We left feeling hungry and sad that they would charge so much for a little amount of food.  I went to La Sintisima (5 stars) down the street last week and the cost of 4 people's meals was $55 in total AND we had to take a lot of food home because the portions were big. The food tasted better too.",

We looked for a good restaurant in town, saw the reviews so decided to come in! We came in with ALL OF OUR FAMILY 11+ , and unfortunately they were unable to accommodate seating arrangements for us all, at one table, however we're able to get us all close to each other. The food was excellent (with a party of 11+, too many dishes to name, but we were all happy with them), my mother a seasoned Mexican food cook was even satisfied!  Gabriela, was a waitress /host and and the end of our lunch our friend! She was very helpful, giving suggestions based on our preference, we also happened to have 3 birthday's in our group, they do not do the \"Happy BDay Song, clap routine\" however, Gabby made it happen be it that they had a guitarist performing in the waiting/bar area, she asked him to come sing for the bday celebration! She made our experience will worth our drive, from Scottsdale AZ for lunch in between soccer games! The family who lives here found a new place to eat at, the rest of the Cali family is glad we were able to experience it!!! .....(of course we had to have Gabriela in the group one)!!!",

The waiter recommended the house appetizer ( cheese fondue ) but did not say what it was. I am not a fan of cheese let alone the main item in a dish. It was ok. Then he recommended their famous pork dish pibil & Nogada dish plus guacamole. The pork was Luke warm. It was replaced ( in 2 sec by a brand new one which tells me they are lined up waiting to be served ) . The guacamole was suppose to BE made table side ( & Shouid be for $14?) but was served pre made. And it was definitely pre made. Their famous Nogada was absolutely pre made & the few chicken pieces in it were hard , dry & tough. Hubby wants to try again.  Not sure for $110 ??)",

We also got the guac and chips which were really good. The guac came win pomegranate seeds and it was a good balance of sweet and salty. The chips were also warm when they were served, that's major bonus points in my book. We got the chilaquiles and enchiladas to share. The chilaquiles were delicious, perfectly cooked egg over easy and the sauce was the green sauce; spicy yet not overwhelming. The sauce in the enchiladas (red) was spicy but delicious as well. Although, I'd caution people who are sensitive to spice from ordering that. My biggest disappointment was the price of the mimosas, $12 for one. That's pretty steep even though they were so good. There are just so many places in the valley you can get a good mimosa or even bottomless, that rivals this steep price tag for a Sunday brunch.",

The food was amazing! We started with guac which was mixed tableside with fresh ingredients. For entrees we got the enchiladas suizas (chicken enchiladas with delicious cheese and sauce) and the conchinita pibil (slow-roasted pork with tortillas on the side). Both of our entrees were fantastic. We also tried their margarita and paloma for drinks.  The service was quick and they were very friendly and accommodating. I was impressed! We expected a casual quick dinner and got a really nice experience with authentic fare. I definitely want to come back here again soon and eat more!",

I asked him what his favorite dish was on the menu and he took the time to describe each dish. One thing to note about Barrio, as Richard pointed out, is that all of their dishes have little to no spice. Nevertheless, they did have this amazing habanero salsa that complimented the dishes very well. My boyfriend got the Suizas Enchiladas and I split the Tomatillo y Chile Verde as well as the Chiles en Nogada with a friend. I didn't get to try my boyfriend's dish because I was so full from the other two, but he seemed to enjoy it very much. The chile verde dish was OK, I probably wouldn't order it again, but the Nogada was to die for. Highly recommend! Also, their table side guac is phenomenal! They put pomegranate seeds in it! Yum yum yum.  Lastly, it's a small restaurant and they don't take reservations. If you've got a large party, definitely show up early. There's a private parking lot in the back, but it's also a little small.",

The pricing is all over the place so you can end up with a good deal or feeling really ripped off depending on what you get. Also, Italian bread instead of tortilla chips = no bueno. Stay away from the enchiladas ... just don't do it. The sauces are horrible so that's the main flavoring the dish. Eww. The tacos were good with their specialty pork and an *ok* price point for $13.

Iniriaaky I was very skeptical since I'm travel globally for my work and have eaten at the very best places. The minute I entered the cafe I was warmly greeted by the host. He professionally yet patiently explained all the local favorites. I went with the del Mar being a fish lover. The plate arrived and I was filled with astonishment of witnessing quality typically found in NYC fine restaurants. This place has it all: delicious food, extraordinary over the top service and local Mexican decor.  Don't hesitate when in Arizona craving Mexican food this is a must stop place. Bon appetite.",

    "text": "I've been to this resto long time ago, but haven't been back since...for what reason I don't remember.  Well I'm so happy I came back!  Now I'm just learning of the history of this place.  Chef Silvana Esparza has won numerous awards and has been nominated for James Beard many times.  Her restaurant has been acclaimed as the \"Best Mexican\" in AZ for many years since opening by not only local mags, but publications such as NY Times and Epicurean!  She was raised in a family whose ancestors were once appointed the official pastry chefs to Spain's royal family!  Then Esparza family emigrated to Mexico in the 1600's where they continued to practice their trade for generations.  This restaurant has been here since 2002 and there's a sister resto called Barrio Queen where I haven't been yet.  After my experience at this resto, I'll def go and try it next time!  What I had: Horchata Homemade horchata served in recycled Coke bottle!  Interesting presentation, but it was absolutely delicious!  It was one of those huge Coke bottles too, so I got like 3 glasses out of one bottle!    Salad A side salad that comes with lunch order.  The BEST side salad I've ever had!  Mixed organic greens, chopped tomato, raisin, and chopped hard boiled egg whites.  Tangy dressing.  Size was pretty big for a side salad too!    Guacamole del Barrio An award winning guacamole.  The you'll see a theme of pomegranate everywhere!  That's because they believe in using ingredients that are available now in season.  Note that this was about two weeks ago that I was here, so they might not have this particular version of guacamole anymore when you get there, but this was absolutely delicious!  It was more like an avocado salad rather than a guacamole that I'm used to that are more mashed and mixed up, but it tasted so good!  Needed more salt so I added some salt & pepper at the table and it was scrumptious with their house made chips!!  Chips They look thick and chunky, but oh boy!  Wait till you taste it!  Light, airy, and crispy!  One of the best tortilla chips ever!  Bread and Tapanade Tapanade at Mexican resto?  Wow!  That was a surprise and it was a pleasant one at that!  At first I thought it was their salsa, and I was thinking to myself, why are they serving with baguette??  Well it turned out to be tapanade made with olives, roasted peppers, and other tasty goodness!    Chiles en Nogada This Chef Silvana's Iconic Dish us a roasted poblano pepper filled with chicken, apple, pear, dried apriocot and pecans, in a delicate almond cream sauce.  Finished with the colors of the flag: cilantro, queso fresco, and pomegranate seeds.  I'm not into sweet entrees, but this dish was excellent!  Flavors worked very well together and it was refreshing to try something entirely different.  If you're used to just a staple Mexican like carne asada burrito and enchiladas, you're in for a treat!  Cochinita Pibil Barrio's acclaimed pork is marinated in achiote and sour orange, wrapped in a banana leaf and slow roasted over night.  Topped with pickled red onion and Yucatan-style pico de gallo.  Flavors were spot on!  Veggie Side Dish Creamy mashed papas and vegetables del Barrio.  Sooooo good!  Veggies so good that even Critsy will finish!  Zucchinis were so sweet and tender and the papas (Mexican mashed potatoes) were so creamy and yummy with a slight kick!  Churros Rellenos de Cajeta de Cabra Their famous churros filled with goat's milk caramel, served with vanilla bean ice cream, and topped with more caramel and candied pecans.  This was really delicious!  I also know that sometimes hot and cold dessert are match made in heaven!  With that said, for this particular dessert, it would've been a 10 out of 10 rather than this 9 out of 10 had they skipped the ice cream and served more caramel sauce or chocolate dip on the side.  The churros were perfect fluffy, chewy, and crispy, but it would've really brought out the flavor with a hot choc dip on the side rather than the way it was presented.  Again, it was still very good!  I might be just super picky.  :)  Next time I'm going back for their flan.  It looked AMAZING and I kept hearing the other table moan with foodgasm!  :D",

I would easily give it five stars, HOWEVER they frequently turn off the ringer on their phone so we can never call in and order takeout! When asked about it we were told by one of the owners that, \"We do it on purpose, in house customers are more important - but we answer during lunch!\" (WTH?!) Meanwhile, the phone rings on silent while the hostess ensures her Snapchat is updated every 30 seconds.  We are frequently in house customers as well, it would be really nice to enjoy our favorite dishes in house or from our couch. Sadly after the last interaction I'm not sure we will be such frequent guests.",

Service is slow...my waitress was rude, but she was very nice to the table next to me. I don't know if it's because my husband and I look really young, and she figured the mature couple next to us would be a big tipper. It was weird, she did not make us feel welcome. We tried ordering their tacos, and was was VERY clear to impolitely tell us, \"today we have no happy hour\". Again, she was rude.  Cute spot, could be a little bigger for my taste. Definitely not for bigger parties of 4. It's a cute spot for a date night, or an intimate dinner.   Their queso fundido appetizer is everything! I am also a big fan of their enchiladas verdes, everything has great flavor, great attention to detail, great presentation.   I would go back, as long as I don't get the same waitress.",

    "text": "Maybe it was my high expectations going into dinner that caused such a let down, but truly it was the lousy food and average service.    Our meal started with margaritas at the bar, which for $8 each, were made with well/plastic bottle/cheapo tequila.  Not even (gag) Cuervo.  Or Sauza.  This was bottom bottom shelf tequila.  Triple sec?  Yep, same plastic bottle variety.  The sour mix was good though, couldn't tell whether it was fresh lime but not sickening sweet.  But $8?  C'mon, that's just robbery.  Love the ambiance, and dig the chicano art vibe.  Servers were visibly not overly happy to be there, and I felt like there was the whole BS sales pitch on food/beverage. The whole \"Who's ready for margaritas?\" line doesn't work buddy.  Had I not gotten mine from the bar, I would easily been turned off to not want to order one.  We ordered our meal, and the server provided a olive tapenade that I enjoyed, but served with cold cut bread?  Ok, so forget serving the obligatory mexican-american chips, but c'mon, must be something more interesting to serve.  Bread was cold and borderline stale.    Our meals came, and I ordered the Cochinita Pibil.  For me, this dish needs to evoke feelings of eating home cooked food in a \"warm your whole body and give you an endorphin rush\" kind of way.  That was completely absent.  The pibil was served with 4 cold and dry corn tortillas (not homemade either) and was easily the saltiest thing I've ever eaten on a plate.  And for me, who is a salt lover, it was unbearable.  Maybe they can get away with serving such crummy pibil because people have never had good pibil?  I don't know.    Girlfriend's tilapia was good, as was my dad's mole negro enchiladas and my mom's pollo poblano.  Not 5 stars good, however.  The mole had too much chocolate for my liking as it was very sweet and had too much cinnamon.  The potato mash they served on the side was tasty.  Probably one of my favorite things about the meal.  My rant will end with this:  enough with chicken breast.  Yeah, I get it, trying to be \"upscale\", but for the love of Foster Farms, serve a whole leg with your mole.  Dark meat is delicious and for me should be served with your homey rich sauces.  Oh, and for the reviewer that said this was actually located in the barrio - go spend some time down in Guadalupe.  This is not the barrio.  At all.",

I have to admit I usually stick to my favorite places when we go out but we found ourselves downtown after a Dbacks game and finally made the decision to go here.    On a Sunday late afternoon the parking lot was packed. We found street parking nearby and loved looking at all the murals surrounding Calle 16 building. We put our name in and was told 45 min wait! Almost walked out but we put our name in and lucky enough it was about 10 mins and we got a table! Lucky for us because we were starving!  We had to try guacamole made table side and it was awesome! They give you a choice of ingredients and we chose them all and the best was the pomegranate seeds. This was seriously the best guac I've ever had in my life. A little expensive for $12 but after eating it was well worth it.   My wife had the carne tacos and  I had the house speciality Cochinita Pibil. All I can saw was WOW! I loved the slow rosted pork. I even saved some of the guac that we were eating with chips and put that in the tortillas. Wife's carne was also really good.   All in all I loved each and every bite at Barrio. I do believe it was a little too expensive, and thought about giving it 4 stars based on the price but while we were driving home we just couldn't stop talking about how excellent our meal was. This was one if not the best Mexican food I've ever tasted. I will be back here and this is a great restaurant to bring out of town guest.",

I had the fish, shrimp, & shredded pork tacos. I couldn't choose which one was my favorite, because they were all really good.   They have so many types of Tequila too. I had a great margarita with 100% agave. Later we ordered some guacamole which is delicious. They mix pomegranate seeds in the mix with tomatoes, onions, and avocado. I think they normally make it table side, but they were pretty busy when I went in there.  The service was great, our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu items as well as the drinks. She recommended items to us that would satisfy what we were looking for. The place has some great art surrounding the walls. They also have murals outside on the alley side. It's quite refreshing seeing this art instead of graffiti coming up to a place. Well done!",

We waited at the bar, drank some cold beer and were in awe of the tequila selection. Once we were seated, the waiter was very attentive.  Bread and olive pesto were served complimentary.  The guacamole was made fresh at our table.    I ordered the Chile Relleno for dinner.  It was poblano peppers stuffed with shrimp and scallops topped with different cheeses.  The dish had a good flavor and presentation but there was too much cheese.  One thing that seemed odd was that one of the bathrooms had a wall full of crucifixes.  The other  bathroom was decorated with nacho libre masks.  It was nice to walk around the building and look at the artwork after such a filling dinner.",

Yeah...you've read right...POMEGRANATE SEEDS. Who thinks of adding that to guacamole? My oh my...the combination with sweet and savory just did wonders to my taste buds.  I had their Chiles en Nogada, which was recommended by the waiter. Oh wow. I seriously have never been served Mexican food like this before. Again, the beautiful battle of sweet and savory. Savory being the chicken and the chile. Sweet being everything else- apples, pecans, pears, apricots, almond sauce.   They had live music as well, so in case your sense of taste is in overload, relax for a sec and switch to your sense of hearing.  By the way...I LOVE THEIR SMALL PARKING LOT! It looks so dingy-ish, and since from the parking lot you enter the restaurant in the back...makes it feel like you're in on a scrumptious secret. Plus, the street wall art was extremely colorful...almost a hint to what your taste buds will experience, and enjoy.  Warning for huge groups...it's on the smaller side.",

Based on that admittedly high expectation, I will say overall I was disappointed.  I went with a friend and we ordered the table side guacamole, Pollo Poblano and Pescado del Mar.  The guacamole was about average...nothing special (ours also had cranberries instead of the pomegranate seeds) .  The Pollo Poblano was definitely a better dish than the Pescado del Mar....tender chicken and a pretty good sauce.  The Pescado del Mar was the disappointing part of the meal.  The dish was served warm (not hot by any means) and the seafood was cooked inconsistently...the shrimp and lobster were fine, but the halibut and scallops were cooked unevenly (some parts were fine, while others seemed undercooked).  The potatoes served with both dishes were the best part of the meal.  We also had the specialty margarita of the day, which was very tasty, but we agreed it was slightly overpriced ($15).  Our server was exceptional and the staff in general was very friendly.  Will I go there again?   I might roll the dice and try another dish (like the Cochinita Pibil).  Overall, an OK experience that I thought was slightly overpriced ($110 dinner and a drink for 2, including the tip).",

Delicious southern Mexico style cuisine that yes, will put a minor ding in your wallet if you choose to enjoy a couple of perfectly crafted margaritas with your dinner. It's worth it, trust me. Take note of the extensive Tequila list.  Guess what!? It's not Sonoran people and if you're looking for deep fried chimichangas the size of your arm, smothered in oily sauce and a pound of cheese for $7.99 you're in the wrong place. Hey, I love Sonoran Mexican food. I had the pleasure of working in one of the best damn Son restaurants in Tucson in my late teens. I have a fucking green corn tamale where my cold black heart should be ok..... My point is I'm not hating, just don't be a tool. Do some basic research on a place before you decide to grace it with your presence. There's this thing called the internet, you can check out many a restaurants FULL MENU from it, including prices...and if you get bored doing that there's always porn! Hey now!  Moving on.. We shared the Cochinita Pibil - Slow roasted pork with achiote rojo& sour orange. It was melt in your mouth amazing served with perfectly tender corn tortillas to wrap the whole mess up in. I will have dreams about this pork, no joke. We also shared the Chilies en Nogada - Roasted poblano pepper stuffed with chicken, onions, garlic, pecans, apples, pears (yes, I'm still listing) and apricots finished with almond sauce and pom seeds. Ohhhhh, sweet lady guadalupe, if this wasn't an immaculate conception in my mouth I don't know what is. Expectations - met/exceeded.  I did find it slightly odd that dessert wasn't 'sold' to us a bit more as we were only offered just that....dessert. What? No visuals? Bummer, because our inner fat kids would've taken over at that point and we wouldn't have had to stop at Culvers on the way home.... just sayin.",

To me, this restaurant shows off exactly what southwest food is capable of. Crappy Americanized Mexican restaurants are a dime a dozen in Arizona (and disaster zones serving microwaved inedible food in PA), but this place offers an innovative, modern take on southern Mexican cuisine. They use fresh, unique, high-quality ingredients.  It's almost an art.  I particularly enjoy the enchiladas de hongos, which features wild mushrooms, white truffle oil and a strong goat cheese. The taste is strong and unlike anything I've ever had before. It lingers in my mind (and most likely breath) for days afterward.   The drinks feature fresh juices. Really, you shouldn't accept them any other way, in my opinion, but margaritas around me in PA are syrupy concoctions of artificial flavors and sweeteners. Gag.  The atmosphere is modern southwest-themed, with bold art on the walls and laid-back, yet attentive servers. I could go just to check out the featured artists.  Go! Right now!",

The downer was our server; maybe he was just having a bad day. I came with my sister for a special birthday lunch. My sister is vegan so she started her order saying she had a few questions as she has a special diet. The waiter shut her down and said \"just tell me what you want\". So she did. Part of her request was rice and beans which they don't serve there, but we didn't know it and he made some snarky comment about if we could find it  on the menu he would pay for our lunch. They served us a large basket of bread, but since neither of us eat bread we asked for tortilla chips. We were told we couldn't have them unless we ordered a side of guacamole. By the end of the lunch we were actually a bit scared of our waiter. Not a great way to spend your birthday lunch. I think this is only the 2nd time in my life I have not given a tip. The restaurant might be good, but we encountered our waiter on a bad day (I have to think something else was going on with him), but made for a really unpleasant birthday lunch. I tried to call the restaurant after to discuss as I felt bad about not leaving a tip, but got sent to a voicemail box which was full. Not a good experience at all.",

The best thing is the salsa cart where you can pick and choose your own ingredients and the waiter will make it fresh for you right there. It's rather pricey but consider your other options are Sonics are places with so-so tasting diner-style food, it's worth it.  I really enjoyed the live music and would definitely return here again if I'm ever in town.",

The price has increased, however - as has all other items on the Menu. My Pork was dry for the 2nd time in a row, and our Service was simply awful. Margaritas are over 10 bucks, and waitress never came around to ask if we'd care for another. I went to the bar and ordered after tiring of waiting for her. With so many better Mexican Restaurant choices in the Phoenix area, we will not return here. The \"No Reservations\" Policy is a letdown also!",

The fresh table-side guac is a MUST. Don't be discouraged by the pomegranates, they add great texture and taste! Appetizer: Esquite (tasty, especially if you like corn)! and entree: Enchiladas Verde, with an egg on top! Perfection. The only reason for my 4 stars as opposed to 5 is because of the delayed service. We found ourselves waiting a lot and having to flag our waiter on multiple occasions. Otherwise, high quality food and unique spot.",

    "text": "I am going to give my honest insights on my experience at Barrio's. The biggest issue I had was with the service. After being told our table was getting cleaned up, we were finally seated 15 minutes later. Furthermore, it took the server 7-10 minutes to acknowledge us and say he would help us in a minute. In this time, the waiter had been  attending the table behind us three times in the time we were completely ignored at our table. Once he took our drink orders and we ordered our appetizer, it took another ten minutes to even get our water. It then took another ten minutes to have our orders taken. This happened after my sister got up from the table to talk to the manager about the time that had passed. Sometimes I can't help to notice that the value on service in a restaurant comes from the leadership. This was apparent when my sister talked to the manager...  Needless to say, our food took forever to come and was completely lackluster. I ordered the carne asada tacos which were good as they should be for $13. I dabbled in the various dishes my table ordered and wasn't impressed by the textures and flavors. The table side guacamole was small, had too much lime juice, and was slapped together effortlessly. The funny part is that we waited 30 minutes for this guacamole I could've made at home but instead I paid $12. How embarrassing!   When we got our check, we noticed the 20% gratuity added because of our party of seven. I understand adding gratuity but it finally made sense why we were given horrid service because the service didn't have to work for the tip. Also, not often do I find the gratuity at 20% and on top of that, for such lousy service. It was quite a disappointing experience. I have always heard good things about this place but unfortunately I believed what I heard.  The reason why I didn't give this place one star is because the tacos tasted good. However, even with a decent plate of tacos, it doesn't overcome a very disappointing experience. If you need recommendations of a place to eat, let me know. I'm all about supporting local businesses but this isn't one of them.",

They were served opened faced and I was a little annoyed I had to take off the tail, chop up the shrimp, and fold it myself... but I guess that's how fancy quesadillas are? Loved the sauce that came with it.   I had the enchilada suizas and my husband the chocinita pibil tacos.   The enchiladas were sooo cheesy and the chicken tender and chunky.   I thought the dish could have used acid given all the cheese, but I also cleaned my plate so I guess I can't complain. My husband's tacos were delish--not too sweet and the right mount of savory.  The house margarita gave me a run for my money... strong and tasty! Would definitely recommend, but warn that it's a little pricey.",

    "text": "I was very excited to try this well-reviewed, Zagat rated dive that's been around seemingly forever.  Well, I don't get it.  The good: the people were very friendly. The horchata was fresh and very flavorful. The the chocolae Oaxaca dessert was pleasing though insanely priced at $12. The cochinita pibil has some interesting flavors.Well, the first one anyway. See below for this to make some sense.  The bad: The noise was insufferable. Sorry but the musical \"group\" for Saturday night has exactly 2 beats. It was just noise for a few minutes at a time followed by silence and then one of the guys saying \"thank you\" followed by a couple people applauding. The music, on top of a small dining room's non-existent acoustics made holding a conversation impossible. Many diners were leaning in to each other with one ear cupped. Others were plugging their ears.  The unfortunate: so there is simply no way that the food can be a total miss on a place this highly rated. My guess is that this was an off night. The pollo poblano was cooked so far into death that it took 2 of us comparing the chicken and the pork entrees to realize we'd been served each other's dishes. Poblano peppers? Well, there were none. The mashed potatoes just tasted odd. The waiter was very willing to switch out the incorrectly delivered dish for another of the cochinita. The second cochinita arrived in less than 2 minutes which was impressive - yet, the pork did not seem to have been marinated at all. The menu suggests an over-night marinade. Hmmm....  In my opinion: I'd rate the people and the server a 5 star experience. But, the ambience was something I couldn't deal with at all so a 1 star for that. The food was not up to what the reviews and ratings had suggested it would be. On balance, 2 stars.  One last comment (in case anyone with the establishment reads this): when we were leaving, an obviously way-too-drunk male patron was standing within inches of one of the female servers. She was practically pinned against the bar. His hand was pressed hard down against hers on the bar top. Clearly he was hitting on her. She seemed a bit scared but was also bravely trying to make the best of it. One male server stood nearby not getting involved. I was about to interject when the male floor manager made an appearance. So, I asked him if the server was OK. He said she was. So I left. But, I think it better to kick an out-of-line drunkard to the curb (well, get him a cab because he was really wasted) and risk losing that customer over allowing this behavior to happen to one of your staff. I do hope it all ended well.",

I then had the cochinita pibil tacos, one of the featured dishes. It was so over salted it was inedible.  During this, our waiter had started off friendly but then became quite rude with my girlfriend. When he saw that I was not eating my tacos, he became actually snotty. He took them off the bill, but continued to act like we were at fault for questioning the food. When we left, he followed us outside and  tried to act like he was trying to understand our frustration, but merely deflected and talked about how he had 25 years experience in restaurants. He was interrupting my girlfriend when she spoke and acting very condescending. There was obviously a time when this was a great restaurant, but not this time. I will never go back.",

    "text": "I have been hearing about Barrio Cafe for a few years now, but had never made it down to try for myself. I seriously question my life choices that I had not been graced with that food earlier in my life.  We ordered Queso Fundido to start. I am somewhat of a queso fundido expert, ordering it every chance I get, but let me tell you, this one blew all the other ones I've had out of the water! The sauce was creamy and smooth, the additional ingredients were thoughtful and full of flavor; the chorizo added the perfect compliment of earthiness and savory to cut through some of the richness. Superb. I'd go back just for that. My partner got the Enchiladas Suizas, which I've also had at numerous places (being quite a popular dish in Tucson, where I'm from) and again; these were in a class of their own. The tomatillo cream sauce was heavenly, the grilled chicken's char was a lovely addition. Delicious I ordered the Pollo Poblano. I didn't know what to expect but man; I have no words. The chicken was crispy and juicy, the poblano sauce has the right amount of heat and sweet, the veggies were cooked perfectly (a bit soft, like my Nana would make), the potatoes had a crispy edge and the rest smooth and buttery. Perfection.  I've eaten a lot in my years here in Phoenix, and lord does it show; but I will say that, without a shadow of a doubt, this was the best food I've had in the area. A bit pricey, but so worth it.",

We are asked if we could be moved in order to seat us all (7) he said we asked for 5 and then wanted to argue with my sister in law about what she said. His final words you can wait or leave. It's not even an upscale restaurant so I guess that's type of service that can be expected. I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND this place to anyone.

    "text": "I am sad to say that this will be my FIRST ever one star review. :( I was really exited to try this place. A group of friends and I love checking out different restaurants in Phoenix and we had a friend who just bought a home in Arcadia.   The first time we went to Barrio it was at the airport and the service was so horrible I didn't even want to bother with a review because I figured....well, it's the airport. No service is ever that great at the airport.  So we finally had an opportunity to get the gang together and head down.   We were warmly greeted by a server and she seated us to our table. Then she went to attend to her tables in the other room. As we started to sit down, there was a tray table blocking one of the 4 chairs so we moved it slightly to slide in. BIG mistake. The server looked at us and condescendingly said, \"OH. Excuse ME, ladies.\"  WOW.   So, we looked at our menus and waited and waited and WAITED. We were slightly confused. Where was or server? Why were we waiting for 15 minutes without ANYONE coming by? There was a server that was attending other tables around us...but not us?  So we kindly asked the busser and asked him if he knew who our server was. 4 minutes later...the SAME server comes to our table and *I KID YOU NOT* looks at us in complete hatred and says in the rudest manner, \"WHAT CAN I GET YOU LADIES?!?!\"  Like WE were bothering HIM!  I seriously couldn't believe it. We were in COMPLETE shock. I looked at his name tag and RICHARD certainly does not belong in the service industry. If you ever want to try this place out-AVOID him at all costs!!! I honestly wanted to ask for the manager but I didn't want to ruin the meal any further than it already had.  To boot, the food was sub par anyway. But-I can probably chalk that up to Richard's piss poor attitude.   I really should have listened to my gut and to  other Yelpers who have mentioned that this place can be unwelcoming. I just really didn't  want to believe it. If you're going to try Barrio Cafe, please bring plenty of patience and don't bring your out of town guests if you want to impress them. NEVER AGAIN.",

In fact, its so good I will get an order just for me so that I don't have to share.  The portion sizes of the entrees my husband and I ordered were huge!  We needed to take half of our meals home.

The majority of the people were not Mexican so they might not be aware that a large pitcher of Horchata could be made with even less than $5.  When I visited, a Coke bottle of Horchata was almost $5. Nevertheless,  I thought I would give the food a try because it did look good.  The manager was our waiter, and I asked him what Longaniza was. He said he didn't have time to explain what that was.  I'm sorry for wanting to know what I was going to eat. I didn't know if I should laugh or just walk out.  In the end I walked out and went to El Guero Canelo on 51st Ave and McDowell.

Which was expected since it was one of \"the best.\" We sat at the bar and enjoyed the Flaca margaritas which were delicious and probably save this review from a 1 star. Two words: Overrated and Under-delivered. The table side guacamole was anything but spectacular. After a long wait for our food to arrive, we were not impressed. The tacos are miniature.

    "text": "Talk about cognitive dissonance!  I love the idea behind this place: authentic cuisine, art adorning the walls, innovative cuisine, no-frills attitude, and a James Beard nominated chef!  Here's what kills this place: Gabe. He is one of the worst servers I have had in a while. He killed the experience, made us want to leave in a hurry, and, in essence, ruined a nice dinner.    Details of the food/drinks: -Beers were $4.75. Hubby got the House Margarita and, while he did say they were poured weakly, it was quite refreshing and used a great mix. -Quesadilla with Langostine Borracho: My favorite dish of the evening.  It didn't arrive \"quesdilla\" style at all.  We had 4 small tortillas topped with the grilled langostine and wonderfully flavorful chunks of goat cheese; there was a flavorful pico de gallo in the center.  It was totally unexpected and totally good. -Cochinita Pibil: everyone raves about this dish.  It was very well prepared, with slow-roasted pork, freshly made tortillas, sour-orange onions, a wonderful mashed potatoes made with Chipotle peppers (which I found out from a food runner since Gabe was MIA), and an interesting vegetable to go with the asparagus. I think this vegetable is the Chayote, from listening to another waiter explain things to his guests with great enthusiasm (cue jealous looks now).  With all this, something didn't quite add up in the dish.  The flavors didn't come together and wow me. -Chicken Mole: The mole sauce was nice, with a good complexity, but there was hardly any sauce on the plate.  Nicely cooked pieces of chicken wrapped up in tortillas, with mole and a cream sauce drizzled over the top. More Chayote and Asparagus.  Good but not great.  Now onto Gabe.  Ooh! I'm still so mad!  He was gruff, inattentive, and just rude.  When I asked if they had pitchers of beer, I got a brusque \"No,\" as he looked down his nose at me.  The hubby ordered his drink, and I said I'd like another minute.  That was a mistake. 5 minutes later he brings the hubby's margarita and doesn't ask if I'd like anything; he just walked away.  As we flagged his down to order our appetizer, I was finally allowed to order a glass of water and a beer.  We had to flag him down for everything. And when the option of dessert came up, he rattled them off to us, without explaining them and, when we weren't ready to decide yet, left again.  A wonderful young lady who boxed up our food brought us a menu so we could read about the desserts.  I was so mad that I didn't want to pay 12 bucks for a dessert and have to deal with Gabe any longer.  Overall final thoughts: -Innovative chef, with interesting ideas. Some cohesiveness is missing from some dishes though. -Fix Gabe. Seriously. He ruined our night! Other servers were warm, friendly, answered questions, checked on their guests, etc. -Prices are a bit steep. I'm not cheap by any means, but I felt like we paid a lot and didn't receive quite the same in return.   -Seriously about Gabe.",

The guac seemed like a revelation, the margaritas had me at \"tequila\" and the service staff seemed happy to be working in such a cool funky place.   My, how times have changed. Its been a while since I was there..and I guess the shine has worn off.   Like other Yelpers..I was less than impressed with the service. But our visit was on a Sunday and I figured, with a smaller crowd, the service would be better. Our server, alas, was epically..\"meh\". I don't think he ever said \"hello\" he said \"what will you be ordering?\", we simply asked for what we wanted, he shrugged and got it. I guess in its most elemental form, that is service. But it isn't ALL bad news.  I watched longingly as other diners had a server who practically glowed. He engaged, he laughed, he made recommendations..oh, and he is multi-talented as it was his artwork on display throughout the restaurant.  Bar service during our wait was no better - in fact, that guy seemed down right irritated that he had to take drink orders. We got our drinks, but only after he got the order wrong the first time (for two drinks?!).  For good food, I can put up with a lot. But know what? The food didn't hit any home runs either. I had a pablano chilie stuffed with shrimp (unpeeled for god's sake!) and scallops. The scallops were mushy and small and unpeeled shrimp is simply unforgivable at this price and the cheese was just a reheated mess. I ate it, but it wasn't worth raving over. We had the guac-and it was \"good\", but I just wasn't wowed anymore. I DID appreciate that they still make their own chips - that's cool, but not enough to warrant a \"weeeeee-oooooooh!\"  I totally wish it had rocked. I really do. I get to PHX about 6X a year and I am ALWAYS craving good food like what they are SUPPOSED to serve at Barrio Cafe. Its funny, because later in the week I ate at La Parilla Suiza, and it was just so much more satisfying. I'll write a separate review, suffice to say, it doesn't get the press that Barrio gets and that's too bad.  Maybe its a case of expectations-expect too much and you are sure to be disappointed. I was.   Here's my one hint for those who still want to eat there. Sunday nights, 7PM, almost no wait. Service probably won't be any better, but at least you won't have to stand in small, cramped space to wait for your disappointing dinner.",

My husband tries a different tequila each visit and with their selection, we could be coming back for 400 years and not try every one... I always get some kind of Cadillac drink. I always forget the name and the server knows what I'm ordering before I do. They don't make bad drinks here. Believe me!

    "text": "Just short of 5 stars.   I went on a Sat. evening several months ago and finally got around to this.  A friend and I split 3 items:   Guacamole Casero (prepared tableside) - excellent! some Chile Relleno - a special that night, not on menu - excellent! Ensalada del Barrio - good - not incredible like the other two items  Wonderfully flavored food with a great combo of textures, which is essential for me.  The place is cute, welcoming and colorful.  Our server - a very engaging guy, forget his name - was incredibly knowledgeable and friendly - wonderful service.   The parking is scarce and it's pretty crowded, plus a long wait on weekends but that's to be expected because the food is great and word gets around!",

    "text": "What an amazing find! I was in town for the weekend and my friend took me here for what was to be an unforgettable meal. This place is rather unassuming among all the other establishments on the street but do not let that deter you! Something I have always loved about traveling is enjoying how chefs will mix the local cuisine and their cooking pedigree. This place surely was a melting pot of that idea!  We came for an early Friday evening dinner and the place was already picking up. A good sign that this place is popular. The decor inside was eclectic and it is not a big restaurant by any means but it really works for this place.  For an appetizer, please get the table side guacamole. As a midwesterner who spent a lot of time on the West Coast growing up, you don't realize how great fresh the avocados are until you leave the West. It was so good here, and the pomegranates were definitely the reason why!  I ordered the Pollo Poblano which did not disappoint! The chicken was moist and tender and the pine nuts in the dish really stood out to me! The cheese on it was also extremely fresh and I just loved the dish so much i ate the entire thing in one sitting! This very easily could have been two meals.  For dessert, we ordered the Churros which were amazing! The ice cream it came with also perfect as well as the caramel sauce it came in! Whenever I come back to Phoenix, I am going to this place!",

The service was terrible (very slow, rude and seem to have chip on their shoulder due to the hype of this place), the food was mediocre at best and the margarita was just okay for 9$. I suppose if you want to see what all the buzz is about go, but overall you can find better authentic Mexican food with a lot less pretentiousness than Barrio Cafe...",

    "text": "Best Mexican food ever in an upscale way. It's not your typical Macayos type of restaurant it's on their own level of excellence. I love their pollo poblano, guacamole and desserts. Everything I have ate here is out of this world. Love the staff! My favorite waiter is Hugo. Everyone should come here at least once in their lifetime. Margaritas are mighty tasty here. By far my favorite restaurant for a couple of years now. FYI the name explains the location, it's irritating for snobby Scottsdale people or anyone to call this area GHETTO, it's ignorant for yelpers or anyone else to immediately judge. Chef Silvana kept it in the BARRIO/NEIGHBORHOOD of Phoenix to represent her culture and neighborhood. Read some reviews and it really irritates me to read the complaints on the \"ghetto\" location. But if you are \"scared\" of the \"GHETTO\" location I recommend going to their location inside the Phoenix International Airport where you will feel safe. I have been coming here for years at all hours and I have never had an issue but it's up to your discretion.",

The only thing was... it was a bit pricey... we did over hear other patrons complaining about the price of their drinks and take it out on the server by NOT tipping, well leaving her .75 on a 26 dollar tab. Classy. I would definetley return.",

    "text": "Always a treat to get back to Barrio. Looks like they've painted some fun murals on the walls in the back parking lot. Feels a little less like we'll get mugged back there heh. Barrio is our favorite Mexican restaurant in the city. You'll probably read a lot of people giving it bad ratings because they didn't get rice and beans with their entree, chips and salsa before hand, and saying ridiculous things like how much better La Parilla Suiza is lol. So if you go and you aren't familiar with authentic southern mexican cuisine, just understand that you aren't going to Macayos.  Started off last night with the Queso Fundido. It's the only reason my review isn't getting 5 stars. (well, that and what I consider lackluster but competent service) First time I've ever had anything there that I didn't think was just amazing. It really fell flat and didn't have a lot of flavor. Other appetizers we've had there were out of this world so this one was extra disappointing. My wife and I both hand margaritas which were great. They have pretty much every type of tequila known to man there also.  For the entrees, I had the pork tacos. As I was eating them I told my wife that they were the best tacos I've ever had in my entire life. She had one of the quesadillas and loved it also.  Highly recommend Barrio. Like I said, it's the best Mexican in the city imo, and the tableside quac there is the best you'll ever have.",

    "text": "I've wanted to come here for awhile, and decided to do it for my birthday. For a Wednesday night it was packed, but we seemed to have gotten the last available table-woohoo! I didn't bother with the guac since the majority of the reviews don't really tout it, and chose to start with the langosta tacos appetizer. They were my favorite part of the meal! So good I could have eaten all four and ordered more, but instead I chose an entree. I had the poblano chicken and JD ordered the chile relleno. Neither of us were really crazy about either dish. Both were on the bland side and my chicken was totally overcooked. We kind of swapped food and I liked his more than mine just because it had scrumptious zucchini!   All in all, we weren't really impressed except for the taco app. The service was so-so, not terribly friendly or outgoing and the entrees weren't memorable or delicious (or worth what they cost in my opinion) I'll probably not return, there are other places that serve better food at better prices and with much better service.",

I've read on past reviews that people say their margaritas are expensive, True, but you get what you pay for!  At least it's not a crappy expensive marg.    Rarely do we venture far from the \"Two Fish Tacos and Two Margarita 'Combo'\".  We'll mix it up with chips and guac once in a while, but that is just icing on the cake.    The decor is awesome and the place is quaint.  The parking is bad and the wait is long.  Worth it?  Hell yes!    I love it when Italians work at Italian restaurants... and the same goes True for Mexican joints.  Thanks for keepin it real Barrio!",
