    "text": "Came here for girls night!! We ordered az88 chicken burger, az88 salad & avocado chicken club.  All were huge & around $10.  Nice affordable option for Scottsdale.   The confetti champagne is a must.  So yum- they pour Chambord & bubbling confetti on top of champs all for $8. The reason we always come here is for the great reasonable food, chic ambiance, convenient garage parking & the bathrooms are super fun!!!   Service is slow but we weren't in hurry so that would have to be my only complaint.   My girl friend ordered the apple Martini (it's organic) & we didn't realize till bill came it was $14-eeek.  So I would stick with the champagne.   Way better deal!!",

There was a 45 minute wait for patio seating, but we snagged a table inside, but right by the open patio (so pretty much on the patio) right away... nice! We decided to share the cobb salad and the self proclaimed best grilled cheese in the world between the 3 of us. The salad was decent and a large portion. I had mine with the balsamic dressing, which was fairly standard. The grilled cheese was alright, but certainly not the best in the world... not even the best in Phoenix. It was cheesy, but the cheese wasn't really melted (maybe it had sat for a bit before being delivered?). Anyway, it was fine, but nothing special. The fries that came with it were also nothing very special.. just plain waffle fries. The portion was large. The bill was also large... a salad and a sandwich, no drinks... 30$!?!?! whoa. I would possibly go back if I were in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't seek it out.",

I do have to mention the ladies room because It was like being in some crazy fun house. The bathroom stall was all mirrors.   The food here is very good. I highly recommend for apps to get their water chestnuts which are wrapped in bacon and the galettes which is like a flat bread pizza.   I liked this place so much after my date, I decided to bring one of my friends here and she loved it too. What a fun gem to find!",

From the decor, the interesting mix of people, and the chill vibe, AZ 88 has been my date night spot consistently since  2009 and I love it more and more every year. The drinks are quite amazing to say the least. The martinis are super potent with flavor and alcohol. ..definitely worth every penny. I am obsessed with the Mai Tai as well as the Mojito.   You can tell they dont use the dreaded sour mix, it's mixed with quality ingredients.   Count on it, the drinks will take you there in no time. The food is soooo good. When i used to eat meat,  the AZ88 chicken sandwich was my ish. The food is always seasoned well, hot and just smack yo momma good. I love going to the bathroom to watch myself in the mirrors that are everywhere. It's so much to say about this place, you just have to go and see for yourself. ..your welcome! !",

I finally had to ask someone after wandering around for 15 mins.   The service was lackluster. Our server gave us the impression we were inconveniencing her more than anything. Not warm or friendly at all.  The menu was mostly sandwiches and salads all of which I wasn't particularly in the mood for. I was expecting more choices. I ended up ordering the Burger Au Poivre II...for $14.50, I was expecting WAY better quality.  I will give them credit for their very extensive cocktail list and the bar is well stocked with every type of quality liquor you can imagine. I had the celebration champagne which was tasty.  Beautiful atmosphere. I'd probably return for drinks at the bar but not the food or service.",

    "text": "To start off with, it has been at least 10 years since I have been here.  I somewhat had to convince my fiance' to pass up Oregano's to come here.  For some reason, she thought it was going to be some random diner.  I laughed and said \"right...\"  I was hopeful that it was still the same great lunch that I was used to.  So we decided to try it on Friday afternoon 9/6.    It did not disappoint.  Our server was fantastic.  He was mellow but very good at what he does.  She got the champagne with sugar confetti in it and was very pleased with it.  We started with the Hell's Fire Chips and they were fantastic.  Would get them again for sure.  I then ordered what had previously been my \"Go To,\" for years:  The AZ88 Chicken Sandwich.  Absolute homerun!  She got the 7353 Club and was very happy with it.  At the waiter's suggestion, she opted for the double-decker, not the triple-decker and it was a wise decision because it was plenty of food for her.  The meat was perfect and as my sandwich was, it would be a repeat order for her when we return.   All in all, it was a great experience and we will be back again.  For a city like Phoenix that has hundreds of places that come and go, AZ88 showed exactly why some places can stand the test of time and not only stay consistent but thrive because they do everything well down to even the smallest of details.",

This place is always hopping with locals who know where to find this hidden hot spot.   The prices for food are really reasonable, and the portions sizes are generous. I would sell my favorite pair of jeans for one of their grilled cheese sandwiches. The waffle fries are also delicious, as are salads, desserts, and the other sandwiches.   I love the rotating art showcased, the sexy bathrooms, and the unique music at AZ88. When the weather is pleasant, sit outside and enjoy views of park and soft breezes.   One complaint might be that it can get loud, but that's because people are drinking celebration champagne (or beers, wines, or just plain water). AZ88 is fun with fantastic food. Go on, celebrate.",

From my experience though, I'd liked the contemporary look of the venue, the outdoor seating options and the generally spaciousness this lounge offers. The bartenders were polite, conversation light and casual. It's clear that this place has a good following of locals, which means they're obviously doing something right.  While I was there, the owner was displaying some 'diamond dogs' in the center of the room, that were won in an auction...okay. Whatever.  I'd definitely like to come back to this place when its more happenin. I think it'd be a good time.",

Ordered two champagne cocktails - a Kir Royal and the Celebration Champagne - and both were excellent and fairly priced.  My boyfriend got their mint julep which he liked (I took his word for it as bourbon, even the smell of it, makes me want to yak).  For dinner he got one of their chicken sandwiches which was tasty but covered in way too much mayo.  It was good, but I thought it was something that could easily be made at home.  My burger on the other hand - best burger I've had in a LONG time.  It was the Burger Au Poivre II.  Don't bother with I, get the II, as it has the bleu cheese crumbles and bacon, absolutely delicous.  This was my first time eating here, and I would like to try a few other items.  My overall impression of this place is that it's a good starting off point if you are hitting the Scottsdale clubs.  Get some apps, drinks and then get the rest of the night going.  I think next time I'd like to go a little lighter because the burger did put me into a food coma.  Worth it though!",

The Good:  I've been here several times over the last 12 years of living in Phoenix and one thing I have to say is this restaurant is very consistent with their food.  It's always good, and when you order something you know what you are going to get.  A sandwich I had 4-6 years ago, tastes as good today as it did back then.    The Bad:  It's not really bad, but to best honest, I think its time for a little make over.  It's one thing to be consistent but this restaurant needs to catch up with its competition.  There are many many new restaurants in the valley, especially in the Scottsdale area and to the locals this can get boring.  This place hasn't changed in about 10 years, I think its time for a freshen up.   Overall, its a great place that brings back many memories from coming here over the years, and I look forward to coming back again.",

    "text": "People dont go to AZ88  for the service, so get over it if youre impatient waiting for a drink or your food.  Enjoy the trendy ambience or venture to the bathroom for entertainment.  Take your pick from the \"He,\" \"She,\" or \"S/He\" bathrooms.  Yes, this restuarant/bar moonlights as a gay hangout but who cares.  No one in Scottsdale apparently because word has spread even through the heterosexual community that this is a great hangout.  SUPER strong drinks, casual atmosphere despite the trendy attitude, and great American cusine make for the perfect combo.    My favorite is the AZ88 chicken sandwhich, which is a spicy chicken with blue cheese on a bun with the best waffle fries EVER.  You can also get it as a salad if youre feeling skinny.    The staff isnt the most friendly or the most prompt so put your patient pants on and suck down a drink while you wait.  You'll forget what youre waiting for.    Food is served latenight and you can walk around the park by the civic center afterwards...  Great date spot.",

I am not trendy, I am not hip, I am not with it and yet I feel so cool when I walk in to this streamlined coolly lit, dj playing place.   Why must I come here? They make an excellent mai tai (my obsession) that is the perfect amount of sweet and tangy. They have Pimm's cups too, which I also adore, especially after a long sweltering day of sitting by the pool. (I know, life is rough!)  The food is super excellent as well. I love the dipping fries with the three sauces and the gallette appetizers. I dream about their perfectly executed cobb salad. Seriously, it's that good. And recently, my friend got their burger and I discovered that TOO was amazing! You seriously can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The staff is really friendly and on top of it. I've been here on really busy Friday nights and super quiet Tuesday evenings and am always treated with the utmost respect and care.   Its been a great place for groups (6+) or for just a romantic duo. It's really cool and classy without being pretentious, uppity or trying too hard. Seems unlike the rest of the Scottsdale cougar scene and more laid back. I really enjoy it here and am already dying for another cobb salad.",

I'd like to think not.....But is there not a cook in town who will actually cook a burger med rare when you ask them to?  Oh they'll say they will, but was that a little smirk on the waitress's face I saw as she turned to enter my order?  AZ88 is known for their awesome burgers.  Got mine with cheese and mushrooms and was assured by the amicable and super foxy young bartender that it would be cooked exactly to my specifications.  mwah mwah mwaaaaaaah......It was well done....again!   I've been duped again!  I will not eat a well done burger that I just paid 12 bucks for, no matter how dreamy the bartender's eyes and kinda dirty but still sexy hair is.  This is an outrage!  Are there others who get as bummed out by an overcooked burger as I do?  I will risk the salmonella or cryptospiridium or whatever, just to have a juicy burg, yo....Is there anybody with me?",

We started off with the dipping fries for an appetizer and the buffalo bleu cheese dipping sauce was hands down our favorite! If you're a buffalo wings fan, try it. Promise you will not be disappointed! For our entrees, two of us had the AZ88 chicken. We swapped fries on the side with grilled veggies - and HOLY COW - were they generous on that! I've never had a place give me so many veggies when I asked for no fries and I was very impressed! The chicken sandwich was delicious and had so much flavor. I wished I lived in the Scottsdale area because I would be a weekly visitor! Side Note -- my friend's initials are AZ and he is born in 1988 so it was extremely fitting for us to dine here on our trip! When we are back in Phoenix -- a stop here is an absolute must!",

The bar has a good selection of drinks, and the food, while tasty, isn't anything super special.  I am in town on business and have gone to many places in Phoenix and Scottsdale and will likely return, but not before trying many more others first.    The prices for food I felt were quite reasonable given the decor and vibe and much better than a chain like Chili's or something.  The staff was nice and friendly....the scene was very \"cool\" feeling, although the menu kind of made me wonder if this was a burger joint trying to feel upscale or an upscale place trying to offer reasonably priced food.    All in all, I would definitely go back, as you can have a good meal and enjoy the atmosphere and decor without breaking the bank.",

I ordered the picnic chicken sandwich with fruit. The presentation of the dish was beautiful. The sandwich was delicious although I think they could have gone a little lighter on the gorganzola cheese it overpowered the rest of the ingredients. But i took some out and it was fine. The server was a bit slow and even though his section wasn't very full he found a way of dissapearing for extended periods of time. But when he was around he was very good and polite. Overall i had another great experience there and will happily be back. If you haven't dined here definitely check it out!",

The Hell Fire chips are a fun & simple app and really compliment a great dirty martini!    On my last visit a girlfriend of mine ordered the AZ88 Chicken Sandwich, I was not hungry, but she could not finish it so she started to push it on me and I'm glad I did because it was DELICIOUS!  I ended up eating three quarters of it and have been obsessing about how delicious it was since.    There is something about the bun it was so fresh and basically bread heaven, the small pieces of chopped sauteed celery mixed with the buffalo sauce was not something I would normally look at a menu and and be like \"oh, I have to have that\" but it made the sandwich and I found myself picking up all the little pieces that fell of the sandwich and into the basket.  I have been CRAVING this damn chicken sandwich ever since and I am driving my boyfriend crazzzzy by begging him to go back with me so I can have it again, I may have to sneak over there by myself!!   If you go here \"not hungry\" order the AZ88 Chicken Sandwich and try not to finish it, and if you can't I'll take it!!  Four stars because the service was slow...20 minutes for a drink.",

    "text": "Today was my last visit to AZ88 after many years. I always brought friends there when they would visit. Was a regular for years. Brought a friend there from out of town for burgers. Drove the long trip. It was a Tuesday about 5pm. The entire time I could not get the waitress to actually stand still at the table. Everything was said and done while she was running by waiting on someone else. We ordered two medium rare cheeseburgers with bacon. Both the same except my friend had tomato's. I wish I had taken photos. What arrived were very overdone fries that tasted like they had been under heat lamps. I snapped one in half and it snapped like a chip. It was that hard. The fruit was old and dried up looking. The burgers were raw. Not pink. Not rare. RAW. As in 100% completely uncooked on the inside. My friend picked up his burger and I thought he was going to be sick. They were cut down the middle so where is the quality control? Can you not see the burger is completely raw on the inside?  Mine was sopping wet with blood and the bun completely falling apart. Both had three completely unmelted pieces of cheese. I flagged down the waitress and explained the situation. Again she refused to actually stand still. She asked if we wanted another. Yeah I drove nearly an hour yes I'm hungry. She put in another order albeit what seemed reluctantly. My friend asked for his medium well this time. He was completely freaked out. I asked for mine medium. What showed up was not the rather large juicy burgers they normally serve that we got the first time but two burgers half the size and clearly premade and sub par cut of of meat. Plainly they were gross. I don't even know why they would have these burgers in the kitchen unless they were some sort of emergency burger in case they ran out of meat. And they still mixed up the order. I got tomato's on mine the rarer of the two but they were both over cooked near burned now. Tasteless. Disgusting. He ate his complaining the whole time that I should have cooked at home but ate it out of being starving. We hadn't eaten half the day excited for burgers. I ate half of mine and just felt sick.  The fries were better the second time but not too good. I took a bite and pushed them around the plate. Four times I asked for extra ketchup I never got. Gave up. The manager came by and was very very nice but you could tell he didn't really care and was just placating us by even listening. He asked what he could do and did I want another meal. Three times now?  No I'm good. I asked if he could just comp it. He agreed absolutely. I was so bummed because we had been looking forward to it.  I don't actually eat out a lot so when I do it's more of an experience than it is for many. I don't know who's ingenius idea it was to now serve the food on trays but it really adds to the cafeteria quality of food they are now serving. If you are going to charge these prices and market yourself as a swanky place at least give us some damn dishware.   He offered a desert on the house. My friend was going to decline but I made him get something. No way this was going to be totally wasted. He got the strawberry shortcake. It was fair. We split it. My stomach was doing flip flops but I was starving. It was very sugary and the topping tasted synthetic and it was covered in powdered sugar to boot. Why would you need to add powdered sugar to cake ice cream whipped cream and strawberry sauce?  It was putridly sweet.   I was ready to tip the waitress when while we were still eating she comes over and plops a reserved marker on the table while we are still sitting there!  We had literally just finished our last bite. That was the nail in the coffin. I was so offended by that final act I will never go back to this establishment.   We've been complaining for the past 3 hours of regret. What we got was a stomach ache and a headache from the experience. On the plus side I'm relieved that I no longer have to drive 45 minutes for my favorite burger. I'll just cook one at home.",

The other folks on the patio were chatty, so there were lots of great conversations across tables.  Highly suggest the Burger Las Brisas, a side of remoulade, and the fresh fruit was great.  Bonus points for great service that was never rushed, and they filled my dog's water dish twice.    Generally, I'm not a huge fan of being in Scottsdale, but I'd go back here without hesitation.

The menu looked promising with it's unique mix of flavors, we decided to share the bacon wrapped water chestnuts (seriously, you can always hook me with bacon wrapped anything) and I shared the Asian shrimp noodle stir fry.  The water chest nuts where disappointing, I think they were expecting the bacon flavoring to carry the dish but it was pretty lackluster. And the Asian stir fry tasted like the cook was very heavy handed in the soy sauce, it was quite salty and I'm pretty sure I downed a lot more water than I normally do for dinner. I couldn't taste much of the other ingredients' flavors because the saltiness was so overpowering.  I can see how this place brings in a lot of diners as it's right by the theatre (which hold many events over the year), but I don't think I'd come back to AZ 88, unfortunately.",

In my most recent experience, the 'flatbread' is more or less a cracker with melted cheese, the chicken on my sandwich was dry and didn't have  a lot of flavor.",

I don't know how many shots are in each martini, but it's enough that the night got pretty hazy after two - and I was told I ended up having almost 4. I stuck to dirty vodka martinis. They have regular, blue cheese stuffed, and garlic stuffed olives... yum!!! Overall, I thought the food was okay. The  hell's fire chips and dipping fries were delicious. My chicken calabrese sandwich was HUGE but just meh when it came to flavor. The side of steamed veggies were good. The service was great, friendly, and attentive! Overall, had a great time and would definitely come back for the martinis next time I'm in town!",

    "text": "Took my first trip to AZ 88 last night, didn't even realize it was right in the Civic Center. Decided to go here kind of last minute when my boyfriend saw an article talking about their burgers in the newspaper.  When we first got there I was a little surprised that there wasn't a hostess. Not that they needed one, it was just unexpected for a nicer restaurant. The ambiance was pretty nice, very open setting. One downside was that some of the booth seats, and the bench in the front was kind of gross and dirty. Otherwise, everything else was clean.   I got the Portobello Mushroom sandwich and a Salty Dog to drink. Our service was great, and our food arrived in a timely matter. The food was good. My sandwich was a tad dry, but nothing a little ketchup can't fix. Also loved the potato chip-type-thing on it. Gave the sandwich a nice crunch. My drink was also enjoyable, a few more chunks of grapefruit than expected, but not bad. Also thought it was kinda funny how they served one small carrot and like a fraction of a radish with my food. Who eats raw radishes? Stole my bf's floret of broccoli to make up for it haha. The best part of my meal by far was the waffle fries. Idk what it is about fries in that shape, but they just taste so much better than regular fries!  My boyfriend got a burger that was supposed to have jalepenos on it, however, when it arrived there were no jalepenos to be seen! He told our server, and he quickly brought us a side of jalepenos. He thought his burger was good, but it was not a personal favorite.   The bathrooms here are pretty funky too. First off, they are impossible to find because theres no handle, and its only labeled at the very bottom where you can't see. The interior is covered with mirrors and the women's bathroom had pink lights everywhere. Was definitely the most interesting restaurant bathroom I've experienced so far.  The price was not too terrible for the amount of food they give you. Sad that they didn't have a happy hour though. This was a unique restaurant to try. The location was nice, and though there are a few things that lack in the restaurant, it is definitely worth making a visit.",

The manager said the charges would be fixed and brought our table a dessert to share which was nice. It took several days for the charges to be fixed on our accounts but it was all fine in the end.

Back then it was packed with the young & sexy and fabulous gay crowd. umm this time (Sat night) the majority was packed with ultra hip seniors.. Im talking 50 & up. Im not talking a Luby's crowd but what you would hope grow up to become. It was like a witch had put a spell on everyone in 97 and aged them all. There was one table of highschoolers but they escaped in time before the witch got them.  As for the food.. A+ for a unique appetizer. Bacon wrapped waterchestnuts! The crunch factor was nothing but awesomeness. Although it was unique and worth a try it wasnt bursting with flavor. I had a AZ88 Cobb and I liked that I was able to pick what cheese I wanted. As for the dessert I requested the Drumstick Sundae hoping it would be like a Drumstick cone.. right? Umm nope..it was good but a Drumstick replica it was not.  The food was decent, the crowd, albeit older, was lively and interesting to say the least. I'd go back and give it another try.",

What I was finding myself growing more and more irritated about what the hospitality. This place is open pretty late, and that's the main reason we came here-- referred by friends. (kitchen is open until around 1 maybe? Don't quote me!) but I work in the industry and would never go into a place if they closed within the hour. Our server was so unbelievably inattentive. I watched her sit stand at the bar and talk with friends for atleast 15-20 minutes (directly in front of us) before checking up, within the first portion of our meal. We were her only table. This repeatedly happened throughout our dining experience. The difference between mediocre and great hospitality lies within how charismatic you are with your guests. I didn't feel important enough or like our experience mattered to her. Which is frustrating. I'm paying good money because I expect good service and good food. If that can't be provided at 11pm (hours before closing) then don't be open that late. That simple. Not worth wasting your money for poor service and alright food.",

It wasn't too terribly busy and there seemed to be enough staff but getting drinks in a timely manner wasn't happening.  The food, however, was worth the discomfort. I ordered \"The Chicken\" and was impressed with the taste and the portions. Waffle fires were tasty but the vegetable and fruit side was rather slim (one carrot, one piece of broccoli, one piece of melon and one piece of pineapple).  We'll give it another try.

I have never had so much beautiful eye candy to look at before. And by the candy, I mean the modern with a touch of contemporary design. Our server was sweet and extremely efficient. She wasted no time giving us what we needed.  I ordered the  BURGER AU POIVRE. It was slathered in a peppercorn sauce. My taste buds were overwhelmed and wanted at least 2  more burgers. It also came with waffle fries. To me fries are fries, so.... The bathroom there is a treat in itself. I had to excuse myself to go to the ladies room, upon entering I ran back to the table for my camera phone. There was no way that bathroom was gonna get away without an Instagram shot slash snapchat from me. I recommend this place to anyone wanting a clean, and classy environment. I'll definitely be back.

Their dirty martini with bleu cheese olives was outstanding, strong, but not to the point where you taste pure vodka, and very good.  Had two of them and they did the trick, I highly recommend.  All the food was great, they had a bacon wrapped water chestnut appetizer which was fabulous.  Sounds weird, I agree, never heard of such a thing, but the water chestnuts were marinated and then wrapped in bacon and they were incredible.  Wings were also good, well cooked, big, tasty.  We split a buffalo chicken sandwich and bleu cheese burger and both were excellent, waffle fries were cooked perfectly, crispy, but not overdone.    Bill was somewhat expensive, but I think it was well worth it.  Three of us for drinks (2 martinis each) appetizers and entrees was about $150.  Not too bad, I'd definitely go back, great food.",

Me and some of my girls decided to meet here on a Friday night and we planned ahead and made reservations since this place is always packed on the weekends :-). I absolutely love the vibe in this place, with it's various art pieces throughout the space and the hidden DJ at the above the dining area it always feels lively when you walk in.  Some of us arrived a little earlier so we had drinks at the bar while the rest of our party arrived; I started with one of their delicious martini's. Once everyone had their drinks we moved to our table so we could order dinner. I decided to go for one of their chicken sandwiches and our server convinced me to add avocado and cheese to it. I was pleasantly surprised when my meal came out, the chicken sandwich was delicious, and I was immediately happy I decided to go with the server's suggestion! The waffle fries were good and crispy and I loved that they also put some pieces of fruit on the plate to balance everything out. It made me feel like I was being slightly healthy :-)  There was a total of 6 of us and everyone loved their food and drinks! Our server was awesome, she was very patient and checked on us pretty regularly; and she didn't complain when we asked if our checks could be split. This place is definitely a great place to start out the night or event to bring a date or out of town visitors, I will def. be back soon!",

    "text": "We found this place on yelp, like we usually do, and I must say what a bizarre little joint in the afternoon. It's off the beaten path but I think it was definitely created and designed for a night time experience which would make it off the hook; but for lunch, I felt like I was at a club in the Castro. The decor was all white with chairs on one side of the table and reclining benches on the other.  The bathrooms are an absolute mystery:  There's is the men's room, women's room and coed bathroom (probably a lot of fun at night ;).  Inside the restrooms they are entirely mirrors with little lighting except for the tvs that are on.  It's almost hard to find your way out.  My husband said there was 80s porn on in his bathroom.  I digress...The food and drinks were VERY TASTY.  We started with the Hell Chips, which would be a total superbowl favorite: homemade salty chips with blue cheese and buffalo wing sauce.  I had the bartender make me a virgin gimlet which was delicious (pregnant at the time) and my husband has something that was served in a copper cup.  Excellent mixologists.  My husband also had a delicious burger and I had a generously portioned salad that I was unable to finish.  This place is definitely quirky but great service and excellent food = 5 stars in my book.  I'll have to go back at night and when I'm not pregnant.",

I had the grilled vegetables, which were wonderful. You didn't even need the dipping sauce that came with it. My husband had the AZ 88 chicken sandwich. For $8.50 it came as a huge sandwich, fries, fresh fruit and a pickle. A great recommendation if you are looking for something new and fun to do.",

What a good idea that was! About 30 people ended up showing up and AZ88 was so good at adding chairs/tables to our dinner group. We started off with celebration champagne SO GOOD! I loved it I think I had 3 glasses of it. I am a vegetarian so I was happy to see the salads and the size! I ended up taking half of it home. I had the Four Seasons Salad (A wonderful salad made with the freshest of leaf lettuce,tomato, radish sprouts, avocado, black olives, mushrooms, red onion and bell peppers. Served with your choice of Bleu Cheese, Thousand Island, Ranch, Balsamic Vinaigrette, or fat-free Raspberry Vinaigrette $8.50). My boyfriend and 2 of my other friends ordered AZ88 chicken sandwich and they all loved it. I heard they are famous for their chicken sandwiches. The prices are almost shocking seeing how much food they give you/the atmosphere. I didn't get the chance to try the strawberry shortcake but I have been told it is super delicious. Definitely will be coming back on a Friday/Saturday night. Definitely a great place to go for dinner and drinks before some late night partying :)",

I should note that anytime I can eat outdoors (I live in Chicago so this is not a usual thing) it bumps the whole experience up for me.  The decor was pretty trendy and modern.  I must say to try out the (women's) bathroom as I thought it was pretty cool.  The service was quick (once our waiter found his way to our table) and my boyfriend and I spilt one of the sandwiches (chicken, bacon, avocado) and for 2.50 (I think) we each got our own basket with fries and fresh fruit/veggies.  I would give it a higher rating but the food was only good (maybe it was our food choice) and they put mayo on the sandwich after I asked for it to be on the side.  Also they serve a soda in a small glass bottle which is one of my pet peeves.  Just give me a normal sized soda!  Overall good experience and I would definitely recommend if you are in the Old Town area.",

Part of what I loved about it was those ridiculous sparkling dogs though. Seriously the food is super delicious and I always worry myself sick about what to order cause will it be as delicious as Elsa Chicken Sandwhich? Also, how much do you love waffle cut fries? Well I don't know how much you love them, but I love them a lot. And this place is a little classier than Chik-fil-a, the only other place I know that serves waffle cut fries. Even though it is in Scottsdale and hip kids like it, it isn't even retardedly overpriced. You should probably go here if you haven't yet.

I love it when people complain that this place is pretentious... why because it is the only place in AZ that is consistently great and has been running since 1988 (far longer than most places ever make it in the dale), because the wait staff is extremely competent and actually looks great and groomed? Because they actually care about the design of their restaurant and support artists and have an extremely interesting and topical rotating art installations several times a year? Or because they have the best drinks in the city, THE MOSCOW MULE IN THE COPPER MUG IS AMAZING!!!!, and the best chicken sandwich and waffle fires I have ever had. Then yes it is pretentious, and I LOVE IT. This place also rocks because they have been putting up with my mom and her friends for 20 years and their silly requests. Like, saying they want their food on a plate not in a basket, they need their diet cokes in the tallest pilsner glass with extra cups of ice, five sides of buffalo blue cheese sauce, and helping them with their strategic seating requests so that they can view every patron that enters and exits..... now come on, that is some service!",

    "text": "I went to AZ88 a few nights ago with a friend, and I've been sitting on this review since then, letting the thoughts and feelings percolate upstairs until I could muster the initiative to actually write something down about my experience.  AZ88 serves a variety of sandwiches, burgers and salads, along with some actual entrees and a short but appetizing list of desserts. The food seems reasonably priced for the geographic location, which isn't necessarily cheap, but hell, it's Scottsdale after all. I had the Club, which probably seems rather uninspired, but it was a tasty sandwich. The chicken was just thick enough to give it some texture and the bacon lent just enough smoky flavor to the whole thing. The tomatoes weren't too slimey or waxy, which is always a plus in this country, and it came served with a decent portion of fries. It also came with a side of what could only be described as \"pointless fruit.\" I say this because it seemed to be the most random assortment of bland discount-bin fruit, the kind of \"fruit salad\" one would find at a Village Inn. Thankfully this didn't really detract from the meal, it was just extra stuff, almost like an oversized garnish (garnishes being another thing I'll never understand). The place itself was nice enough. It was dinner time in Scottsdale on a Saturday night, so we were surrounded by old people and fake tits. There were a few cougar sightings (a common occurrence in Scottsdale), which warranted hushed-tone jokes and guffaws between my friend and I. I don't get the ridiculously huge mirrors that stand imposingly against the far wall, but what do expect from a fancy establishment? All-in-all an a-ok experience. The food is good, and if you stick with a sandwich (chicken or otherwise) you can easily stay within the $10 range. Just watch out for the booze (beer seemed average; cocktails were a bit more).",

The bread didn't get soggy and the mushroom was hearty and fulfilling.   My boyfriend had the club sandwich and waiter said the sliced boiled eggs on top was a must. He wasn't disappointed.   Great drinks as well. Love how you get the bottle of Coke and can mix how you like it.   Will be back soon.",

This place, which has been open for 40 years, is right under my nose and around the corner in Old Town. It was a weeknight after a DBacks game, but there still was a good crowd manning the bar and the tables. Not every place that survives 40 years is still good, but AZ88 delivered two very upscale burgers. The meat is delivered fresh and ground in-house and as a fancy touch they cut the burger in half for you before it reaches the table. The bigger Mac (1/2 pound) clearly tasted just like the fast food version, but better of course, and included decent waffle fries, fruit and raw veggies. The mural above the bar is also quite interesting and this place also seems to be french or french related. Either way, late night has a new home for me in the dale.",

Anyone who asks me about AZ88 hears this story to dissuade them from going.  Dinner at AZ88 began with my waiter spilling an entire martini glass all over the front of my dress.  While waiters make mistakes, ours made no attempt to help mop the drink off of my dress until we requested additional napkins. Instead, he rudely asked, \"Would you like another waiter?\" while still not helping to clean the mess he created.  Eating dinner completely wet is uncomfortable enough, but when we got to the check, we found that nothing had be comped. It's a shame that AZ88 has allowed its waiters to treat guests rudely and with no regard for their needs.",

The restaurant gives out a fancy vibe but is a bit confusing because you don't know if you are over dressed or under dressed once you start seeing the mix of tacky decorations (ex flowers with plastic straws). The restaurant in general is beautiful with big glass windows and nice patio that overlooks the Scottsdale Arts District. We wanted to sit outside but it was full so we dined inside (seat yourself service). Staff are dressed very formal but the theme of the restaurant screams more casual/retro with disco balls as a chandelier and neon lights to be more artsy I guess. The menu was pretty basic with burgers , salads, sandwiches, and a handful of entree dishes. We ordered the dipping fries as an appetizer which is pretty much waffle fries with 3 dipping sauces. For dinner we ordered the China Lil's Chicken sandwich which came with more waffle fries and a little fruit. The sandwich came on a basket like you were at a fast food restaurant or food truck stand. Food was just average. Our server was nice but a little slow with drinks and dropping off check. Overall AZ88 compares to food you would eat at a sports bar. Although you get the retro vibes, I think this place is stuck in the 90's. Perhaps updating to a more casual/modern environment.",

Once our food was delivered our server deserted us. Someone stopped by long enough to clear our plates and empty wine glasses, but crickets after that. We never saw our server again, no one asked if we wanted to refresh our drinks or if we wanted anything more. I mentioned, as our plates were being cleared, that the tuna was not good, but again, crickets. No one cared. After a very, very long wait we finally had to get up and go find someone who would give us our bill so we could pay and leave.  We could have walked out without paying and no one would have noticed.  On top of terrible food and service the place is horribly noisy.

The Cheeseburger is big and fills you up.  It's also very tasty.  The Dipping Fries are delish....I only get them when I'm super hungry or if someone else is willing to split it with me, otherwise I will go back to the office with a serious case of carb coma.  The service here is awesome.  If you're here on business, the servers give you space and make sure they don't interrupt too much, but at the same time ensure that you're drink glasses are kept full.  I highly recommend.  Return Factor - 90%",

Nice selection of cocktails as well. portions on the smaller side.   A fun trick to play is not helping someone else find the restroom. spoiler alert: the doors are part of the wall by the bar. there is a sign on the floor instead of above like you would expect, and there is no traditional handle you just push into the wall.  There is one unisex restroom on the other side that is like a disco room on the inside.",

The food is just as good too.  Had Elsa's chicken.  It was grilled in dragon sauce, which was slightly sweet with a hint of lemongrass.  The candied pecans on it paired perfectly with the slightly sweet sauce and the chicken was so moist.  Even the waffle fries were fantastic.   Only downside is that they don't take reservations and the wait was a bit long and bar was too packed to grab a drink while we waited.",

    "text": "AZ 88 (so named since it was opened in 1988) is definitely the kind of place that you can really enjoy one time and not so much the next.  Even though my visit was great, I can see the shortcomings.  That said, this review was for a Sunday lunch when the weather was great and the outdoor patio seating was a treat.  The patio overlooks Civic Center Plaza, trees, flowers, interesting people, and no cars.  It is kept clean and the seats are comfortable!  The food was just right for the time.  My grilled cheese sandwich came with a thick slice of perfect tomato and several slices of very tasty bacon grilled inside the sandwich and a hardboiled egg - neatly sliced -- on the side.  Add waffle fries and it made a really pleasurable meal.  My wife had the picnic chicken sandwich with real slices of cold grilled chicken and lots of it, set amidst a beautiful fruit plate.  Service was perfect as well and the price is moderate, about $10 a sandwich.  So why wouldn't you enjoy AZ 88?  Our experience was based on: 1.  Sitting on the patio 2.  Beautiful weather 3.  Wanting only a simple lunch 4.  Getting there before the rush so we could get a good table -- if was full by 12:30  If you want a more substantial meal, or something fancier, AZ 88 might not live up to your expectations.  And if you eat inside, the restaurant loses most of its charm and becomes just another comfort food place.  But I can only review what I experienced, and that was five star.",

They stayed open later on weeknights than any other bar around my hotel during my trip to AZ, allowing me to have a drink after arriving in town. That alone is worth 5 stars to me.   The staff is beyond friendly, even remembering me on just my second trip there. That alone is worth 5 stars to me.   The patio is a lovely place to sit and enjoy the outside night air.

Brought it to the server's attention who said she didn't see it but could replace the bun or the entire sandwich, what would she like for her to do?  Remove the sandwich from the bill is what should have been done, as well as just replace the entire sandwich, offer something else maybe?  We split the bill evenly and I was not happy we each paid for a sandwich that our friend shouldn't have been charged initially.  I was hoping for the same great food I had experienced in the past but this wasn't the case sadly.  I will return but probably just for the appetizers and drinks strictly.",

    "text": "I've been coming to AZ88 since 2000 and it continues to be one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley.  The quality of the food has never disappointed nor have the always knowledgeable bartenders.    If you like salads, the 88 offers several tasty options, with my favorite being the Cobb Salad.  The blue cheese they use on their salads and in their dressing is always excellent.  For appetizers, I recommend the Gallettes or Hell Fire Chips (excellent waffle fries!)  Their burgers and chicken sandwiches are all excellent, as is the BLT.  Plus, there aren't too many places that serve a sandwich with a side of waffle fries AND fresh fruit.  A little fresh Cantaloupe and Pineapple with a sandwich really adds to a meal and sets AZ88 apart from most bar/restaurants.  If drinks are in order, AZ 88 continues to serve up the best tasting Moscow Mule and Dark and Stormy in the Valley.  They don't have draft beer, but their bar staff is too knowledgeable to not have them make an excellent martini or mixed drink for you.  The bar area is gorgeous and runs the length of the space and provides an excellent vantage point for people watching.    *Tip 1* Planning an Old Town pub crawl and need a place to line your stomach and kick the day off?  AZ88's food is excellent and inexpensive and the drinks....one Dark and Stormy will kick off your pub crawl day in a good way.  **Tip 2** The artwork above the bar changes throughout the year, but I highly recommend you check it out during the Christmas season.  ***Tip 3*** If you're new to AZ88 or have brought someone that is, send them on an adventure to find the bathroom!!!",

I remember coming here for birthday dinners & what not YEARS ago (I'm probably talking like 10ish years ago) and it pretty much seems the same then as it is now (menu, decor, taste of food, etc), and yet despite such little change it still has a \"hip\" feel to it.   In the past I always used to get burgers & chicken sandwiches and they were always tasty. This time I got a club with bacon & avocado on wheat bread. It was yummy! Honestly, there wasn't necessarily anything special about it, but it was just plain good! I love the waffle fries at AZ 88 & I like that they throw in a few pieces of fruit on your plate so you feel like you're getting a few bites of something healthy with your meal.   The decor at AZ 88 is really trendy. White tables & comfortable couch-like booths. The service is good and the prices are very reasonable (especially for how much food you get). I like how they allow you to split the same sandwich with someone and just pay $3 extra for a full order of extra fries & fruit.   AZ 88 is a really fun place to come to if you want to feel like you're being \"fancy' without paying a lot. Now that I've rediscovered this place I'll be back again soon!",

Messed up everything literally on a 4 top that we ordered.   Ordered eagle rare on the rocks told her 3 times the order. She came back 5 minutes later asking neat or on the rocks, really?  Gm or manager on duty was like her evil twin. Clueless careless and rude. After being there for an hour and half then finally getting our food and was all wrong walked up and told him how bad the experience was and he acted big didn't truly care.   At the end of the day mistakes happen but not reacting and not caring about them is just plain disrespectful. Don't like to bash places or bitch about a place I've been before a lot and loved but when things are just this bad and no one even acts like they care is very disappointing",

They were crisp but without flavor.  Some kind of salsa would have helped.  My friend had the burger which she said was good.  I visited a second time with 3 of my friends and we sat again at the bar.  We ordered a fruit plate, a cheese plate,  and cerviche.  The fruit plate was very nice.  The cerviche was basically pico de gallo with tiny shrimp, no fish.  The cheese platter had grocery store variety slices of swiss, cheddar and provolone cheese.  It did not come with bread or crackers.  For $2 a plate of plain galettes  (lavosh crackers) can be purchased.  We ordered them and they were crisp and nice, but why were they not provided with the cheese platter?  Also their water tastes strongly of our Arizona minerals.  A water filter would help.  Our group respectfully asked our bartender if we could speak with the manager.  We told our bartender that we loved the atmosphere and service at the restaurant, but were disappointed with the restaurant's food.  We made it clear to our bartender that we wanted to help the restaurant improve as we would like to return.  The manager declined to come talk to us.  We will not be returning.",

Tomatoes are also haphazardly arranged on around the crackers and then a slice of cucumber and radish in the middle. It's really odd. There were also no caramelized onions on ours either.   I ordered the burger las brisas for my entree. The burger itself tasted really yummy, but everything else was a mess. I love spicy and am no stranger to jalapeno, but these had a funny taste and were out of this world spicy. I also really didn't like that they sort of pressed the burger. It literally disintegrated. The salsa was just chunks of tomato. There was a good amount of avocado which was nice.   I was so under whelmed by the experience, it's such a beautiful restaurant and I wanted to love it. It was over priced and didn't deliver. Plus the service was slow. I really want to come back but I just don't have a reason to!",

Our server was great, and that was probably the highlight of the night. He sang, (like ACTUALLY sang in a sexy voice lol) happy birthday to someone outside..The wings were good but I wish I had known they would be all drumsticks. The chicken sandwich was a little dry. Nice drink selection and people watching. Ended up being $44 for two beers, wings, and a chicken sandwich  (both came with fries and veggies). Glad we stopped in to check it out, but unfortunately it was nothing to write home about!",

The place can get busy; sometimes you'll find a DJ spinning and sometimes it's just the sound of people enjoying the night while someone gets lost trying to find the bathroom doors camouflaged by white walls. I've seen this place on the worst nights and the best nights and I can honestly say that they are consistently the best place to dine in Scottsdale.  The menu is simple & inexpensive. The patio are is fantastic and the service is always great.  I am always trying new places, and at the end of the day AZ88 is my go to place.   Tip- sit outside, it's located in the art district and there's such a great vibe. Also- this is a great place to bring a date or a family of all ages. The mix of guests is what makes it amazing.",

The service is always courteous and prompt. It's surprising how they consistently find interesting waitstaff with a wonderful demeanor.  The menu is unique. I've had the chicken sandwiches pretty much every way they make it as well as the salads and the S.S.S salmon dish. I keep going back to the China Lil's Chicken, the Hot Pepper Chicken as my two favorites with the S.S.S. a close third. The bar makes a great martini. Overall, when we're in that part of town AZ88 is always on the list of places to grab a bite. Oh, parking is very convenient, with a big structure behind AZ88.",

My order was very simple.  I ordered the BLT on wheat bread, no mayo, with sliced hard boiled egg.  The order took an enormous amount of time to arrive.  No big deal, it was a beautiful day out.  The weather was perfect, I was sitting outside, there was a Native American festival going on with music so I just relaxed and enjoyed myself.  My lunch arrives on white bread with mayo.  The server deposits the sandwich on my table then leaves to wait on someone else.  I flag him down to let him know my order was wrong.  He takes the sandwich back- tick tock, tick tock, the mouse ran up the clock AND ran back down SEVERAL times.  I was starting to feel famished.  He brings the sandwich back- it is on wheat bread- but still with MAYO.  Omg, really???  He started to take the tray back and I was so famished, I told him to just take the sandwich and leave the fruit salad/ salad and pickle (otherwise, I was going to have to gnaw on his hands!!!  I was soooo hungry!!!).  He obliged my request- 3rd time was the charm- got my sandwich as ordered.  The manager was nice- came by twice and apologized . . . although he did not give me a discount or comp me the lunch . . . hmmmm.",

Very nice decor and classy feel, the food was delicious. Unfortunately a large group of 8 or 10 customers insisted on being loud and using profanity  in their drunken state. Evidently it seemed management knew these people and they were obviously complicit with their actions of being too loud and rude. Will consider again but I'm sure there are many other restaurants that are classier.",

It is located a little bit out of the way, so there isn't a lot of foot traffic. The views from AZ88 include the Love statue and the park, as well as some neat sculptures and art installations all around the room and outside of the lounge. It is impeccably designed insight--with minimalism-meets-art gallery inspiration, and the menu has some great choices with a good amount of variety.   My husband and I enjoyed some drinks and ended up ordering some casual food--he had a club and I had an incredible grilled cheese sandwich! The service was great and the staff was very friendly. We will definitely be coming back!",

This was a very odd set up which required some people to sit where the tables met which gave them really no space to put their dinner plate. There were square tables in the dining area so I am still a bit confused as to why they chose our arrangement for the seating.  The decor and ambiance was pretty nice. They had a huge tree in the middle of the restaurant made up of about 4,000 dollar bills. There were also some other interesting art pieces and sculptures around, which apparently these rotate out often.  The food came in metal trays, which seemed to confuse me with the fancier ambiance. They have everything from burgers to wings to salads to well more of American bar food but a bit more sophisticated I suppose, but not really.  Overall the time was fine because of the company. The server was pretty attentive but I am not sure if I would recommend someone to check it out.",

The DJ was everything. I don't know who he was I think they said his name was DJ Josh but he was playing all the jams. Totally set the vibe. The drinks were great and the bartenders were friendly. What more can you ask for. Look like most folks were there on a date so I guess it's a great date spot. Pretty affordable too. For two drinks, two shots, and a hamburger we split, it was $44. That hamburger was crazy delicious as well. It was the peppercorn burger. Try it. Passed by again the next day during lunch hour as we visitored the Scottsdale art festival next door and it looked a lot more posh and bougie. More upscale snowbird like crowd and much less diverse. I'm sure food and drink would be just as good though...",

He was also borderline combative when my fiance didn't like her cheeseburger.  We simply didn't want it but we didn't mind paying for it either.  Instead he turned it into a big deal and loudly proclaimed he'll just pay for it out his own pocket.  Then he aggressively grabbed it off the table.    I called the restaurant to make my complaint direct.  He was nice and offered gift cards but we're good.  They shouldn't have to pay for his wrongdoi  Overall, it seemed to fall on deaf ears.

Loved that they offered a dish with roasted veggies and your choice of protein. We went with the shrimp. It was a perfect afternoon snack with two lovely cocktails!  They served up cool cocktails that were delish! We had a Flirtini and Martini with blue cheese stuff olives and they were great.",

It was booming last night when we were there.   it is very loud in there so if you are looking for a quite atmosphere, this is not it. They don't seem very organized with respect to having a visible hostess, getting you seated and ordering.  It took us 15 minutes before getting menus.  Once we did get acknowledged by the server, she was attentive.   We started off with the galettes w/chopped olives, bacon, carmelized onions and some parmesean cheese w/tomato slices on the plate.  It had a smoky flavor that was really good.  Think of these like a super thin cracker.  We then had the waffle fries w/three dips.  - Two words - yum - my!  The dips were fantastic.  The menu is simple, mostly hamburgers, chicken sandwiches & salads.  The menu doesn't seem to match the atmosphere.  The burger (Au Povoire) was very good.  Beef burger, bacon, red onion on a fresh bun.  It's worth going once.  They have an awesome outside patio you can sit on as well.",

    "text": "There's something ironic about AZ88. It really is a bit of a paradox. But not neatly so. On one hand, the words that other people have used to imply the vibe of the place are fair. It really is all of those things; assuming, euphuistic, grandiose, inflated, magniloquent, pompous, showy,  and sometimes downright snobbish (thank you <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthesaurus.com&s=d772d28b25fa6bc4bc26aa90699fb19f61150e11dd12058dc4b4efa339c9a06f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">thesaurus.com</a>). It's in Scottsdale. People dress up to go here. Coyotes are always on the prowl. That being said, they have $7.00 sandwiches, people in khaki shorts and t-shirts sitting on plastic chairs outside in the 70 degree Phoenix winters, and mediocre service (sometimes downright slow). So, I still can't quite get my head wrapped around this place. One thing I did learn is to avoid the cocktail menu unless you're an American Express Red member. One night a friend and I ordered a martini each and our bill came to $25. With tip almost $30. Thanks but no thanks. So, this place is the yin and the yang, the best of times and the worst of times, the id and the superego. I think that you almost have to go once just to decide if you love it or hate it.",

Read several reviews of AZ 88 at the mall and it sounded great but a little hesitant of the 'mall' location. We were pleasantly surprised it wasn't inside a mall but found a beautiful contemporary restaurant overlooking a park setting next to the performing arts center. It was a lovely day so we choose to sit on the patio.  The prices on the menu were so reasonable I couldn't believe it.  Sandwiches and salads and burgers plus entrees ranging from $7.50 up. I had the BLT with apple smoked bacon and my spouse had the burger. The orders came with a gourmet presentation of fruit, basket weave fries and one of the best sandwiches I have ever had.  You would think you were sitting at the Four Seasons.  The waiters were very attentive and the whole experience was so wonderful we went back the next day before leaving for home.  It was also written up in Fordors travel guide so we knew it had something going for it.  This will be a regular stop for us when we return, just an amazing classy place where you can go in casual attire. Guaranteed not to disappoint. Parking tip: park in the free covered garage on the bottom floor (not the floor you enter on) near the far end and you will be very close to the walkway and the restaurant(10 yards).",

We used to go there and people watch but now it's the most un-interesting scene,  like something you might see at Applebee's.  I'm hoping it was just a bad night even though it has been this way the last 2 times I have gone.

The fish was grilled fine... the sides were completely lack luster... the only thing with any hint of flavor on my plate was the wasabi.  I like it hot man, but that green devil paste was (to my complete and utter shock) the hottest wasabi I have had. I kept trying to liven up the blandness of my dish with the hell fire paste, but alas it was either too little and drowned out by the soy, or the equivalent of 100 tiny Chuck Norris' round house kicking my sinuses. I could have used little red riding hood to sniff out that just right amount she is so fond of.    My husband was equally unimpressed. I just don't see a second trip in our future.",

AZ 88 is a trendy looking place in the Scottsdale Civic Center Park with patio seating right next to an immaculate lawn and enchanting promenade.  The menu is chick-heavy and full of unique takes on classic offerings. I tried the Elsa's chicken sandwich and was not disappointed with the soy-ginger dragon sauce. My girlfriend ordered the buffalo chicken salad and we split a salmon and cream cheese on potato chips appetizer. Like I said before, enjoyable experience overall and I'm definitely planning on going back to try the other offerings on the menu.",

She was friendly and really took care of us. They had some tequila reps there and after asking if we would be interested in tasting it, Rebecca was able to flag the reps down to make sure that they came to our table. She really went above and beyond to make sure that we were happy.  As for the food, everything was delicious. I had the Hot Pepper Chicken sandwich, which was so good. I loved the waffle fries that came with it. To drink, we both had the raspberry lemon drop martini which was absolutely amazing.   I highly recommend this place. Cool artwork on the walls, good music, delicious food, and a great atmosphere.",

The most infuriating part of this was that the manager couldn't possibly have cared less. When my husband, an M.D. called to report it, she said that no one else had called in with a complaint. So, big deal...right? It's often hard to pinpoint where food poisoning originates, but this was a very clear cut case. Shame on AZ/88 for taking the report of food poisoning by a customer and an M.D. so lightly!",

Only possible negative I can think of is that the atmosphere tends to be inconsistent. What I mean is that AZ-88 can either be a chill and relatively quiet spot or packed to the gills and loud. Nothing they themselves can do about it but just a warning for those who expect things to be one way or the other.",

You can go for a carriage ride, stroll the fountains, and eat pretty good food. Someone has to pay for that location. We started with the bacon wrapped water chestnuts, touted by all. They were different, I get it, savory and sweet. It was under $10, dip them in honey (the sweet part). They make good drinks here. Moscow Mule was spot on, copper mug and all. The Portobello sandwich was delicious, wings (all drums) delicious and both cam with really fresh waffle fries. The place is trendy, spotless, full of trendy spotless people, all seemed to be having a good time. I think this would be a great date place, because of all the things mentioned previously. Red head bartender was a great help, I didn't et her name, but she should get a raise. Came here last year with a wedding party and the service was awesome as well.",

    "text": "To be honest, my disappointment is likely due to all the hype I've heard of about this place over the years. I have friends who went here when they first turned 21 many, many years ago by this point. I love Hanny's, and I hear people comparing/contrasting the two places constantly (same owners, right?) People would say, \"If you like Hanny's, you'll LOVE AZ88!\" I just have never visited since I am rarely in the area, and if I'm in the area, I have strategic strikes planned -- in and out as fast as possible (or I'm visiting a friend's house.) The traffic in this area is especially heinous, so I only go there when absolutely necessary.  Recently, we stopped by the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art. After, we were starving, and we couldn't decide on where to eat. I also had dental work done recently, so I was feeling especially indecisive. We had walked by AZ88 on our way in after parking in the nearby garage, but we honestly didn't even realize it. The signage is quite subtle, after all. While wandering around the area and beautiful nearby park, enjoying the beautiful weather (and deciding where to fly our newly-acquired drone that wasn't in class B airspace), we finally resigned to leaving the area and seeking out food on the way to droning.   As we passed by AZ88 once more, I checked out the interesting ink-drenched statue in the patio area and noticed the small \"AZ88\" wording. After a few moments of processing this information, I exclaimed \"OH! It's AZ88!!!\" We immediately decided that this was it. This was the place we would be eating lunch. After an eternity of contemplation and deliberation, our time had come. Our stomachs were ready.  We saw the \"seat yourself\" sign and precariously found a place inside. The small patio area outside was full since the weather was beautiful, but inside was nearly empty. There were maybe 2-3 other tables filled in there. Once we found a spot, we sat there for quite some time. Eventually, someone came out to see us and brought us water and menus. We didn't see them for quite some time after this.   During the Great Waiting Period, someone from the kitchen came out to bring us a carafe of water as our glasses had been empty for some time. She had noticed our empty glasses from afar and wanted to make sure we were taken care of in that department. We greatly appreciated that :) Unfortunately, we waited much longer still before being able to order. We ended up sticking with water since it had taken so long to even get a drink order in. I was going to get tea or perhaps even a cocktail, but I wasn't feeling up for more than water after the wait.  We put our food order in and waited some more. They weren't THAT busy, so we were a bit confused and frustrated with all this waiting. It wasn't a ridiculous length of time compared to horrible service we've had in the past, but it was certainly unacceptable -- and nothing at all like Hanny's on a much busier day (or even late night.) We were not sure why it was so slow, but hopefully it's not always like this. It was just a late lunch. This was not a great first impression, though, so I don't think we'll be going out of our way to visit again.  On top of that, the space was somewhat interesting, though it is definitely overshadowed by places like Hanny's these days. The bathroom was interesting and beautiful, but those who had claimed I would be blown away by it (considering I love the restrooms at Hanny's) ... well, I wasn't :) I did take a selfie in there, of course! The purple LEDs and fully mirrored mozaic-style walls were quite catching! :) However, that was really the only noteworthy experience we had there. There were some other interesting features, but overall, the interior was not that unique or fascinating. We did love a few pieces of artwork here and there, though.  The food was decent, by the way. Nothing noteworthy either way. The waffle fries were tasty, at least. I don't normally eat bacon, but I did get it this time on the sandwich I ordered... but it was mesquite smoked, I believe, which I wasn't a fan of. Just personal preference there, but it was extremely smokey, which distracted from most other flavors in the sandwich. Those waffle fries, though... they were ALMOST as good as Chick-fil-A! :P",

    "text": "We love the interiors and the food but this last visit was really disappointing. We brought a friend that has never been to az88 to show his some awesome dining experience on a Thursday evening/ and our friends graduation from the medical school. It took them 30 minutes to clean all the tables around us (I was trying to wave and it wasn't very busy when we sat down) and finally got someone to come to us and bring us a glass of water (108F outside;). When we got the waiter I asked him how his day was he rolled his eyes said \"busy\" so we smiled/ ordered 2 appetizers (amazing water chestnut appetizer we love btw) few drinks and I got the Chinese chicken dish that happened to be a thick fillet on a burger bun. The food arrived promptly and that's fantastic/ it tasted great. I asked if I may have a knife for my chicken fillet since 1. I eat with fork and knife <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2F2.it&s=e94dd8d17f5a9dbf9702f74fe889509c23ca8663a3b21940ec2a77a6564596be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">2.it</a> was super thick fillet l and hard to eat differently. Our waiter told me that this restaurant Only offers butter knives. My husband and our friend told me that they don't agree with this attitude. I have dined at the AZ88 often when I had an office nearby and the bar tender always got me a steak knife when I was eating, so I knew this waiter was just not wanting to help?!? We payed right when we saw him again/ and we went to another restaurant since it happened to be a special occasion for us and we wanted to make a beautiful memory not struggle over a thick piece of meat with a butter knife. It's not a cheap place to treat your customers poorly",

    "text": "For martinis, there is not a better place in Arizona! Whenever I am in the mood to indulge in pure vodka concoctions, this is where I go. Be careful, two martinis will knock you on your bottom though. My favorite martini is the grapefruit cosmopolitan! It's so fresh, light and the perfect balance of sweet and tart. I always go here with a girlfriend and usually we split the martinis. Who knew you could ever do this!?!  As if the martinis aren't enough reason to go, the atmosphere is constantly changing. I love going every quarter or so to see what the decor looks like. I think my favorite was the taxi cab theme, but I also really enjoyed the diamond/crystal theme. While this may sound funny, you have to check out the bathrooms. The lighting is pink and creates a fun vibe. Be careful though, too many martinis and won't be able to figure out how to open the door.  When you go here, be prepared to spend a pretty penny on the martinis, but know you won't have better ones in this state...totally worth it!",

Bartender was super nice and helpful. We left Old Town Tavern because it was too busy and we wanted some food. Got in and sat at the bar, ordered a moscow mule and it was good. Decided to order some food as their kitchen was still opened.   I order the chicken something and my friend ordered the chicken wings. The chicken dish was okay. It was weird because the chicken was super thin (they probably pound it down) and had this brown sauce to it. It satisfied my late night stomach growling. The chicken was a bit dry though. The grilled veggies were awesome, you can actually taste the grillness. The side of potatoes was good, hot and fresh with a side of sourcream. My friend's chicken wings were pretty good.   Not sure if the menu at night time is the same as dinner, but we would come here again for the late night food and some good moscow mules.",

Server never brought us menus which we believed to be because we may have ordered prior to them being delivered. However, with the place empty and full of staff just hanging around and chatting, our drinks never arrived. 15 minutes into waiting, our snacks arrived but we left due to the enormous frustration and uninterested behavior of the staff. Extremely disappointed and perhaps, the days of the old AZ88 are bygone.",

A server once recommended a blueberry lemon drop and it's been my favorite drink ever since.    The drinks may be spendy, but the food is relatively cheap.  I love the ceviche and the picnic chicken, but I've never had a bad meal here.  You can't beat the atmosphere with the cool patio overlooking the civic plaza...especially fun late in the day during the Culinary Festival with Mr. P-Body spinning records.  The bathrooms are super-cool (strange comment, but it's True)  Once you locate the appropriate one for your gender, you feel like you've been let in on a secret!  And, one of the best things about AZ88 is that every 6 months or so they completely change the decor and add funky art installations.  The crowd seems a bit more sophisticated than other Scottsdale places that are filled with the typical posers.  It's very gay-friendly and on Friday nights the eye candy is delicious, even if they aren't paying attention to us straight girls!  You'll find all age groups here, which ends up as a nice mix, like an interesting dinner party.",

Since, as I've mentioned in other reviews, I'm stubborn about not drinking even one drink if I'm driving, I've only had soda.  And not wanting to spoil dinner (Mom would be so proud) I haven't eaten there either.  So, I've observed alcohol.  I've observed food.  But from experience I can tell you only that their sodas are bubbly and quickly refilled.    But to most folks, as good as their burgers are, and as yummy as their fries appeared (Kid you not, I was tempted to ask a neighboring table for a fry as they looked that good.  And that is NOT my style at all.) AZ 88 isn't a place you go for the food.  It's the look.  It's the proximity to all the other action.  It's the amazing rotating art.  It's the feeling that you are somewhere fancy and exclusive when you just walked in and grabbed a seat.  And that patio doesn't hurt either.  One of the best places to people watch.    Funny side story - first time I ever heard of the place I had a completely different picture in my head.  An older couple I knew (70's) told me about this great place they loved going to for a burger.  How fun it was, and how it was so fun and relaxed, and how all the gays went there.  Between the name and their description, I thought it was some gay neighborhood burger joint filled with knickknacks like an Applebee's.  I was one step from expecting sawdust on the floor.  Shocker when I first walked in the place, let me tell ya...",

It has neat bathrooms, kind of a cool looking bar, and modern seating everywhere.  Everything is very modern, and if you're into that kind of thing, then here is your spot.    Perhaps it is just too image conscious for me.  I just don't like it.",

Flirtini's are amazing tasting and will kick your butt!  Just like I like it.  Bartenders make all the drinks pretty much perfect.  Service is incredible.  Shqipa, Rachel and Amir are all amazing!  One of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I've ever had.  Try it on pumperknickel.  Cobb salad w/ havarti, MMMmmmmm!  Great ceviche and hell fire chips too!

    "text": "I've been in a handful of times, and last night was also no disappointment. After looking for a place to have a glass of wine late, I ended up here, as 3 or 4 other places in Old Town were either closed (Napoleon's and Tapas Papas Fritas both closed at 11 PM??? Well, Napoleon's closed forever, so I heard, but won't believe...) or dead. Citizen had a multi-course private affair they were finishing up. Kazimierz had some kind of themed jazz party going and was raucous and demanded a cover charge. But good ol' cosmopolitan-cool AZ88 was next on my list, where I had a fantastic Pinot Noir (and Tempranillo), cheese plate (their kitchen stays open till 12:30 every night), and warm and friendly convo with spot-on bartender Steen. Another bartender came in later and was relating his favorite summer drinks in a bon vivant fashion. They do have a killer Moscow Mule which is served in a copper tankard to keep it cool.   I've been coming in here, on average maybe once or twice a year since around 2007, and let me say at AZ88 the good things don't change. They still have a tantalizing food menu (they are a full boar upscale restaurant), and a drink menu that, together, rival anything else, really, in Lower Scottsdale (and in much of the Valley). Not to mention the atmosphere that for me has the perfect combination of sophistication, decor, music (4 more stars for the DJ's mellow-ambient rhythms) service, and vibe that indulges all the senses wonderfully. I'm now making this place my default destination for treating myself or a date like VIPs, as they've shown what it takes to to be among the best at what they do.",

    "text": "We had a business lunch there yesterday and it was packed with the Arts festival going on. The City of Scottsdale is having an arts festival this weekend and it is very cool! We went after and there were two stages, lots of booths and even a kids area!  Back to AZ88, I guess the reason you are reading this!  There was a line to get in (although we took patio seating outside and got to sit right away). The couple in front of us had a little marital \"tiff\" as the wife didn't want to sit outside. The temps were in the 70's and this couple was from Wisconsin, but hey their loss was our gain!   As usual the food was excellent! I had the club sandwich with bacon and chicken.  The waffle fries (my favorite by the way) were a little skimpy but I made it work, with the huge sandwich that was served!  However on this visit, the service was not that great. One person in my party (there were three of us) asked for extra dressing with her salad, when she needed it (about 15 minutes into the meal) she finally just got up and went to ask for it. Same when we wanted the check, our waitress was nowhere to be found. Took forever to get our check and then when she never came to get our payment we just went inside.  That being said, when there is not an event happening, this place has good service, funky bathrooms (and I mean FUNKY) and free wireless! When I want a quiet \"working\" lunch this is the place I like to go.",

The more important reason I come here is for the burgers and sandwiches that they have.  The menu has a wide range of stuff that is quite the crowed pleaser.  I have never left unsatisfied with my meal and the wait staff is really attentive and not pushy.  You feel relaxed and happy, which is the way I like to enjoy my meal.  The bar is actually really cool, I have yet to drink at it but it always looks like its poppin' so it cant be that bad.    Its also affordable compared to some of the other restaurants located in the scottsdale area.  Recommendation:  For a cool, young, hip, and classy place, go here, and for a great meal with 2-6 people.",

All 5 of the other people in our group were drinking martinis, which they all said were very tasty as well, but at $12-$16 per, I'm a little put off.  I'm more of a beer guy anyway, so I had a couple of craft-brews that are not available everywhere, and then settled on a Firestone DBA -- a very very tasty beer -- and had several of those.  Great food, great booze, club music atmosphere is pretty cool. Outdoor area is excellent. Felt like an idiot when I had to ask where the mens room was only to turn around and find that the huge wall of a door was right behind me and said \"he\" in huge letters on the bottom of the door.  Oh and then (6 or 7 strong beers into the evening) I found that the mirror next to the (only) urinal in the mens room misled me into believing there was a second urinal, which I tried unsuccessfully to walk to.  Why is that guy walking directly toward me?  Oh, it's me.  In the mirror. Dumbass.  So then (after relieving myself in the actual urinal) I go back out to the table to tell the story about trying to use the urinal in the mens room that doens't exist, and somebody else says \"yeah the same fucking thing happened to me too!\" so I don't feel like such a dumbass anymore.

    "text": "I love AZ88  There, I said it.  While I will admit that I was first introduced to AZ88 by my \"Will,\" it is a very mixed crowd and depending on when you go, is certainly no more of a scene than anywhere else in Scottsdale.  Weekday lunches are quiet with business associates or old money who lunch.  Early evenings often attract senior citizen couples on their way to the theater.  And then, of course, there's late-night on the weekend...in which case bring your sunglasses at night.  Nonetheless, the atmosphere is consistently cool and stunning--walking in just brings a smile to my face.  The rotating decor always makes me look forward to seeing what facelift will have emerged the next time I go.    My all-time favorite drink is served here--I don't think it's on the menu, so be sure to remember SUMMER SOLSTICE MARTINI.  This is one freaking stiff drink, but the alcohol will sneak-attack you like a ninja so don't be suprised at how goofy you find yourself after just 2.  Toss in the AZ88 Club (I like mine with chicken/avocado, on wheat with no middle bread) or China Lil Chicken sandwich and I'm a happy camper.  AZ88 is a fun spot with a lot of energy--I have organized large groups there for multiple birthdays and celebrations.  They don't take reservations so if you're trying to get a large table on a weekend night, be prepared to get a drink at the bar or slump onto a couch on the patio for awhile.    Maybe it's just all my great memories there, but for me, AZ88 = love.",

This is a great twist on nachos....a combination of sour cream/cream cheese and salmon.  Try this and you won't be disappointed.

There are what looks like diamond-studden animals in glass display boxes in the middle of the room & the bathrooms have 2way mirrors!  I feel so violated.  I was using the restroom when I started to get a creepy feeling about the stall being enclosed with mirrors so I decided to do the finger test (when you put your finger to a mirror & if your finger touches the one in the mirror, it means it's a 2way mirror).  I was surprised to find my finger touching itself in the mirror with no gap!!  I decided to hold it until I got back to my hotel out of fear that my restroom break would become a show for someone on the other side.    Anyway, onto the drinks.  As comfortable as I was on their reclining lounge chairs, I had 1 drink so I wouldn't prolong my stay there any more than I needed to (I was already at a good buzz at this point).  I had the Celebration Champagne, which was pretty tasty.  It was a sparkling wine with some juices (I can't remember) & some tasty sugar crystals on the bottom.    I'd probably re-vist for the drinks & the fact that it's open late.",

One of our favorite restaurants back in Ohio has blue cheese chips which we love love love, so that is why we wanted to try AZ 88's. Big mistake. Personally hot sauce and blue cheese are not a good combination.    AZ 88 does offer good people watching...we definitely saw a woman meet a guy at the bar and next time we looked over they were making out. Klassy.  I really didn't like the decor of AZ 88...it's a bit too sterile for my taste.

Let's start with the place. Modern, clean, open, dramatic high ceiling, cool bar.  I didn't drink since I was driving but I sipped my friend's dirty martini. Let me put it this way: It was powerful. Two of them would be more than plenty.  The food was really good, specially for the price.  The shrimp cocktail was great, the sauce was spicy and a great presentation.   The bacon wrapped water chestnuts were pretty good too.  We spitted a chicken sandwich with buffalo wing sauce. It came with a side of fries.  If I have to complaint about something, the fries were a little plain.  But again, the price point, the service, the place, the ambiance make this place a must.  I won't let that much time pass by before my next visit!  Cheers.  UPDATE  I went again and was as please (if not more) as the first time.   New favorite: Hell fries!!!

    "text": "Oh AZ88 how I love you... But $14+ for a martini?  Come on... We're not in Manhattan.  I'm pretty sure that's the last place I paid that much for a drink.  Maybe I just don't spend enough time in Scottsdale? (My wallet thanks me)  The service is fantastic, as is the people watching, but the food was just so-so yesterday (had a chicken sandwich which was pretty dry & my friend wasn't thrilled with her food either).  Nonetheless, I will be back to over-pay for the delicious drinks & enjoy the ambience & I'll be sure to order the Cobb salad next time which was amazing the first time I had it (& the words \"amazing\" and \"salad\" rarely come out of my mouth!).",

    "text": "Stopped here with 3 other friends on a recent Sunday night.  Gave AZ88 a try because of it's affiliation with Elsa's (which we like) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  We walked in from the outside (where there wasn't anyone to greet us) and meandered toward the bar where we were given indignant looks by the waitstaff as if to communicate, \"How DARE you get in my WAY!\"  It was OBVIOUS we were GUESTS/POTENTIAL PATRONS (hello!!) trying to find out whether we needed to be seated or could seat ourselves and where (indoors vs. out).  We got some cynical lip service from the waiter and then finally were seated outside.  After that, the hostess appeared at her stand, which made it evident where all the earlier confusion had come from -  the hostess wasn't at the outdoor hostess stand when we entered.  Well, that's no reason to treat patrons like INTRUDERS, huffy waitstaff!!  Suffice it to say, the vibe in the entire place was just plain WEIRD (one women's stall in the bathroom almost PITCH DARK and the other LIT?!  What kind of a statement is THAT supposed to be making?!)  The restaurant itself is set waaay back from the main street where most of the other action in town is going on.  The vibe of the STAFF was weird.  The waitress who attended to our table seemed flustered.  None of the food was anything at all to write home about, the music outside was way too loud (we couldn't converse without yelling), can't name one aspect of the place that seemed \"in sync\".  Would never go back.  SO many other good places to go in Scottsdale/Phoenix.",

I had to leave but I wanted to pay first, someone else offered to take my payment since the bartender was busy making drinks.    I didn't notice it at the time but I in my rushing to run a quick errand while my to go food was cooking, I dropped some cash on the ground.  When I realized this I hoped maybe it would still be there waiting for me on the floor.  I returned to pick up my to go order, but the money was gone.  I asked my server if anyone had found some money on the floor, without a moments hesitation all the staff started to ask on my behalf.  They located my lost money and returned it to me.

I go here for lunch with girlfriends and have the fabulous AZ88 salad with ice tea, or martinis with friends (the best in town!) and an appetizer or two to share. The food is plentiful and delicious, a big step up from 'bar' food, but not fancy and not pricey either. The staff is always friendly and attentive. When the weather is nice, they have a lovely patio that actually looks out on a green belt/park area and not a parking lot! But indoors is also a treat with fabulous art and a modern design. If you go at the holidays you can also see their annual \"tree\" in the dead center of the restaurant. Always a wonderful work of art!",

    "text": "AZ 88 is somewhat of an Old Town Scottsdale institution, since it's been making foodies and barflies happy for more than 20 years in the Civic Center Mall. The striking spot, with glass walls facing the exterior and patio, has an endlessly breezy vibe because of the open feel of the decor.  The ambiance may lure you in, but the tasty American food and handcrafted cocktails will keep you coming back. I always love whatever food I get there, and my last visit to AZ 88 for my pal Peter's birthday was no different.  I ordered a Grilled Cheese sandwich ($9), which came with waffle fries and fruit and was mighty tasty. I love that the yummy food in such a chic atmosphere is so affordable.  And the libations at AZ 88 will keep you so happy, too. Definitely try their sangria-it's solid, and I'm a huge sangria fan-and if mojitos are your thing, you won't go wrong here.  You'll also love AZ 88 for the bustling and friendly atmosphere. I've never had a bad time here and would recommend it to anyone!",

    "text": "I know my opinion is biased, it's impossible that it wouldn't be considering that I worked at AZ for 4 years.  But let me explain why I feel the need to write a love letter on yelp at 2 in the morning and why you should still care especially since you never worked there.   FOOD: It's simple and delicious.  This is the 10 dollar burger that you wish you would have bought 2 of just to take 1 home.  At least 8 different cheeses to choose from, or do the combo 4 cheeses, add grilled onion, lettuce, tomato, and maybe some Nueske's bacon (ask for it extra crispy).  BLAMMO.  You will try to replicate it at home but it will never work. It is the best burger I've ever had and I was born and raised in Nebraska. And it's not just the burgers, the chicken sandwiches, the salads and the apps are all great.  And keep in mind I've seen all of this made, It's not that it's just great food, it's that it's all done in an impeccably clean kitchen with a great cooks that care about what they're doing. I have never seen such a consistent kitchen staff as I have at AZ, come in at 7 pm or call in an order at 12:29am and the food will always be good. BAR: Holy Moly I don't even know where to start.  I've been in this industry for 15 years and I've never seen a bar staff put out such a quality product in such a small amount of time.  AZ has the most delicious drinks that for the most part are all concocted in pint glasses, shaken and poured into rather large martini glasses with ingredients that include, but are not limited to; fresh cucumber and mint, hand squeezed juices, fresh sweet and sour, orange juice ice cubes, cherries that aren't soaked in formaldehyde, and an arrange of spirits so broad that first time patrons usually walk in with their mouths agape.  But what would booze be without someone to serve it to you? Sit at the bar and get to know your tender; good stories, great cocktails, and handsome men in ties. WAITSTAFF: Again I know I'm biased, but this is one hell of a waitstaff.  Be it gluten free, dairy free, or basically any allergy, and this staff can handle the order.  They know all of the ingredients and are able to special prep things for you even on the busiest of Saturday nights.  The best part is they will make it look easy (I clocked 6 miles on my pedometer 1 Saturday night).  When it comes to attitude don't be fazed by the \"Scottsdale idea\" of AZ.  I have never met a more down to earth group of people in my life.  They will remember you, what table you like to sit at, the Malbec you like with your burger and the name of that song you want the DJ to play.  Again, get to know your server, they will surprise you. AMBIANCE: This review is already way too long so I will just say that the surroundings are ever changing, and it's kind of like an really cool modern art museum that you can eat and drink in and spill on the floor and nobody will yell at you but who cares because you  wouldn't hear anyway because the music is the jams. But it is sooo beautiful; park, trees, statues, giant patio lights, glass house, crazy xmas trees, etc. etc. etc. SHOUTOUT: Also, let me just say, that none of this would be possible without an amazing owner that cares about his patrons just as much as his staff.  Which, in turn, provides a great and caring management.  And then becomes a solid team of people that actually give a shit. To the best crew I've ever worked with.  You know who you are and I miss you.",

While I've tried nearly everything on the menu at least once during my 20 years of frequenting the place (hell, does that date me or what), my AZ88 standard is the Picnic Chicken Sandwich, with a side of homemade waffle fries, and a Long Island Iced Tea.  The presentation of the Picnic Chicken is outstanding and the taste is extraordinary. Juicy pieces of white chicken breast, pears, walnuts, and a slightly spicy Dijon mustard combine perfectly in each sublime bite. But, did I mention the drinks? The Long Island is but one of their many cocktails that are done just right.   Outside of weekends, when the place gets crazy, the service is prompt and the servers attentive. There's a certain polish to the service that's unusual in this city, unless you're dining at Houston's. Lounging on AZ88's fab patio, it's hard to imagine a better place to chill - and eat - in the 'dale.",

    "text": "AZ-88 is at once chic, urban, fun, and just enough Scottsdale without making me want to stab myself in the face, as a t-shirt-and-jeans-wearing, overweight guy.  You'll first notice the atmosphere, and with good reason--it's perfectly lit, with noticeable but not mind-numbingly blaring music, and even better, they have a live DJ who goes through no small trouble to beat match and keep things rolling throughout your Wednesday-Saturday evening dining experience. When I first hit AZ-88, it had an enormous deconstructed NY taxicab suspended from the ceiling which was a fantastical conversation piece. The wall behind the bar was completely covered in names and numbers. (I was far too proud when I accurately guessed that they were the names of cabbies and the numbers were their license numbers.) Overall, a very different, fun look.  Comfortable chairs and very full cocktails abound, and while they typically have a rock-steady delivery, more than a little cosmo has ended up in my friend's purse, to her chagrin. That aside, the food is fantastic and even though it's a bit hard to get out of here for under $30 per person (because you simply must try the cheesecake, and drinks are pushing $14), it's worth it as a classy-but-casual night out that you can really enjoy.  They have a great patio, the burger is dripping with flavor (and, in fact, cheese), and they have waffle fries with pretty much everything. Great salads and sandwiches help round things out, and they ship their cheesecake in from Carnegie Deli in New York which is just about the most perfect cheesecake you'll have the good chance to try. Forget that Cheesecake Factory nonsense, these people know how a cheesecake is done. It is rich, thick, with just a hint of sour, and an amazing flavor that takes your tongue hostage and demands whipped cream ransom.  Overall, a wonderful place for drinks and good food with friends, and the staff is pointed but efficient and will throw back any shit you give them, in good humor or, as appropriate, not. (We've never run afoul of that rule, but you wouldn't want to, I assure you.)",

And we spend alot of time enjoying the Burger Au Poivre (peppery and wine-y) + Picnic Chicken + St Petersburg app 3.  Out of towners staying in OldTown, this is walking distance for them for a meetup. 4.  Drinks are Scottsdale prices, but the food for sure is not... a great deal for this chill atmosphere!  Is the over diligent Give-Money-for-Pet-Charity man still lurking in the parking garage??  I've stopped parking there a few years ago for the Buckboard parking lot -- dude, I love helping out but that little old man was worse than a used car salesman...",

The food is delicious and very affordable, the drinks are great, but the people watching is likely the highlight of the experience.  For a fun night out, AZ 88 is a great choice.",

The martinis are always ice cold, and poured so full that you have to bring your mouth to the glass to take a slurp before you can pick it up.  The gallettes and the hells fire fries (extra hot sauce on the side) are the best apps for sharing, and I never get anything besides the AZ88 chicken salad, chopped and tossed with ranch on the side.  One is enough for two people to share.  It's a great spot for meeting friends and people watching, and has remained consistent over all the years that I have enjoyed this place.  The patio is fantastic.",

But the service on a what seemed like a not-so-busy Saturday afternoon was pretty frustrating.  Took us at least 7 minutes to find someone to cone get a drink order.  Then another 15 to take our food order and when it all came out we were missing someone's food to where she said that its right back there and then never saw the waitress for another 5 minutes. If it was right back in the window she would have just gone and got it and came right back. Nope. She came out and started filling other tables glasses and stuff with no sign of our missing entree. Then at the end we asked for the bill, she brought it, we were passing it around for a minute trying to delve it all out and figure out the math to give to the appropriate parties of 2 and after she saw us struggling she then stepped in and asked if we wanted to split it by couple. So we said of course. She came back with the bill split EVENLY 3 ways. NOT split by couple. We were so frustrated by this point that she got minimal tip and no one will make an effort to go back there anytime soon.  We'll make our food to-go orders from now on.",

And why did we go once a week?  --Cheap food and expensive drinks.  The appetizers are great (my fave is the hellfire chips), the salads are great too (and big), and the chicken sandwhichs come with a whole chicken breast - big enough to order w/o a bun and still leave with a full stomach.  And if you are into those foo-foo martini's, they have the best in town.  And always FILLED to the brim.  If not, they have a great selection of everything else.  --Great people watching.  There's a diverse mix of people - gay, straight, families, retirees, etc.  Fridays and Saturdays are best for this.  --Cool spot.  Michael Johnson did a great job designing the place.  If the name didn't give it away, I'm guessing very few people would know the restaurant has been there 22 years - the building still looks modern and contemporary.  Lots of glass, big white walls - classic.  I highly recommend AZ/88.  Its a fancy restaurant with $12 meals.  PS - a lot of people complain about the location, but its a great location.  Its on the Scottsdale Civic Center mall next to the Scottsdale Center for the Arts, SMOCA, and the library.  I suppose the folks complaining would prefer it in a strip mall next to Walmart.  Sorry.",

Clearly one of the highlights of the place. I had the Moscow Mule and my husband had the Aged Old Fashion. Both were unique and delicious!  Order wings for sure. They're a staple there. We shared the teriyaki wings and they come with waffle fries. Both were amazing!  We shared the Burger Au Pivore. So dang good. The burgundy glaze in there was to die for. They'll split it for you and give you extra sides (waffle fries, veggies and fruit) for $3!  The scene was quite bougie and probably not my style but we had a great server and enjoyed our drinks and food!   Overall, you should visit.",

This place is not designed to accommodate large groups....we were a group of 12, that's three 5 four tops pushed together essentially.  Well, we got three round 3 tops pushed together, and by 'together' I mean, one edge of each circle touched the edge of the next table, so four people wound up sitting where the tables touched.  Guess what that leads to, yea..no table, just a big inverted V where your table should be. That's fine, just place a menu across both and voila!  Table leaf.  But should I need to become an engineer to figure out how to eat at my meal?  Isn't that the job of...an actual restaurant designer person or something??  So later in the evening a group of 14+ came in, guess what they did??  More round tables in a row...right, behind, us.  Like, I can't push my chair back to get up to go to the bathroom close...what is up with that??  So after getting my masters in table redesign-seating-placement-leaf-ology I was able to check out the menu.  We did get a platter (yea, a platter) of wings, they were really good!  I'd get them again no question.  I opted for the  Truck Garden Chicken, it sounded simple and good. The chicken was overcooked, dry and had way too many peppercorns. I ate less than half.  The waffle fries were good.  I think the best thing I had was the wings, and the bourbon.  It was a fun time despite all of that, but I don't think I would come back.",

Everything I've ever had has been awesome! The service is great- our waitress was very attentive to us without rushing us out of there. We were able to sit outside and it was LOVELY. They make a great margarita and have a wine list with a variety of price points. I would definitely recommend AZ88 for all groups- families, girls night, date nights, or big groups!",

Went there with about 12+ people for dinner. We had a reservation, yet they seated us at these small round tables pushed together. Not good for a group at all. No one really had any table space or personal space. That part was not well thought out. At all. I get that the space is supposed to be modern and artsy, but don't modern and artsy people need proper seating arrangements for a group dinner? LOL.  That being said, they did serve me the best, and I mean the very best extra dirty martini I've ever had. It was filled to the brim, like an infinity pool, and I watched as our server masterfully and slowly brought it to me. He didn't spill a drop. Bravo! It was ice cold and had that briney taste I crave in a dirty martini. The blue cheese stuffed olives were so tasty and fancy.  The food? Well, it's not what you imagine it would be in a fancy-pants type of setting. It's more like elevated pub grub. Sandwiches, burgers, wings. I enjoyed the food, but with the type of food served and our seating/table arrangements, it just didn't work. It was like we were all sitting at the kids' table at Thanksgiving. Picture it - I know you just did.  I ordered the Bigger Mac, and it really was delicious. The waffle fries were good too, as well as the apps that we had to share. I really loved those bacon wrapped water chestnuts.   The decor and ambiance of the restaurant do not match the type of food they serve. It's just a bit off-putting. I was expecting more of a foodie type place, which is what if feels like, but the food was more like a sports bar. It's interesting to be sure.",

We had Cobb salads that were generous and flavorful, chocolate mousse cake to die for, surrounded by stark black and white decor and green scenery through the floor--to-ceiling glass walls. We sat beside the one-story tall \"Christmas tree\" made of 34,000 hanging safety pins, 1,600 key rings and 2 miles of fishing line. The staff were friendly and welcoming and professional. Service was timely and pricing reasonable. Definitely worth return visits! PS visit the restroom!",

So of course we went again ten years later and it seemed as if we haven't left - of course the menu had changed a bit but other than that still a classy place for a drink. It is a self seating restaurant so if you'd like to grab a  table, get there before 6pm on the weekends. Their cocktail menu is extensive but their martinis are unique in the way they are served - I am sure the waiting staff is required to pass a test for this. The martini glasses are filled to the rim and almost looks as if the  liquid is bulging on the top. I am pretty sure I'd spill half of it just picking it up! So for that reason you want to get a table. The service was great; our waiter was patient enough for me to describe a drink I had ordered there before (Basil martini - not on the menu anymore) and the bartender was able to replicate it exactly as I remember it. A must do if you are in the area!",

Everyone else at my work loved it, but I only found food I tolerated after many tries.  It's really big. I'll give it that. Giant portions of mediocre food. And I've tried a bunch of different stuff since I've had so many shots. The Chicken is a giant greasy favorite that tastes pretty boring. The burgers are nothing special. The Caesar salad is way too lemony. The fries have nothing going on. If you get them to go, they come soaked in pickle juice. The dish I eventually settled on was the Caesar with grilled shrimp. They gave you some amount fewer than 5 shrimp for an exorbitant shrimp fee, but they went well with the sour taste of the Caesar dressing. The chicken and Caesar not so much.",

It didn't really work too well for that since it was hard for us to hear each other over the music (they have a live DJ on Saturday nights) and also the tables don't really work well for large groups. It would be a much better option for drinks before a show at the performing arts theater which is just steps away. I kept seeing martinis being delivered to other tables around us so that must be their specialty. For us group of non-drinkers (on that particular night) we didn't sample any of their cocktails. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food but no one really raved about it. I had the ahi topen faced sandwich and it was really yummy. If the service had been better I probably would have given them another star.",

Granted we went there before a show at the Performing Arts Center and it was packed but , eh.  It's an old timers vibe now as compared to the gay fabulousness it apparently used to be.  We came and had a few drinks/appetizers before the show.  The patio is all white and very sleek and the inside is minimalistic and upscale. The bathroom is fantastic.    Our waitress was a bit on the slow side, although it was fairly crowded.  The menu for the food/drinks are not extensive and a bit on the pricey side.  One of my friends got a salon, cucumber dish that could be described as 'salmon nachos\" and it was very interesting.  I got the flatbread and it was a little dry.",

They do have a parking garage adjacent but there's not a lot of signage.   Loved their decor and how they have their back wall (bar area) showcasing their hard liquor. The lighting, choice of paint, seating are all done nicely and has a modern/hip feel.   The bathroom blew me away. I did miss the \"hidden\" door and had to seek help from wait staff to find secret door that had \"SHE\" at the bottom. Inside I found translucent stalls w/pink soft lighting. SOOOO cool looking! And, wait for it... 360-degree mirrors in your own stall!!! How sexy is that, ppl?!?   Anyways, I did order a cheeseburger and their ever-famous waffle fries. Burger was tasty (bun was a sliver dry) but waffle fries did disappoint me slightly. They came cold and hard - boooo!! Cmon guys - you are better than this! Mojito was DAMN fine - try it! Lots of good, muddled mint leaves - just how I like it!",

Needless to say, I was less than presentable, yet experienced lovely service despite pink ribbons and sweaty compression gear. Now, you might think that anything would taste good after walking twenty miles in the desert, and while that may be True, I think AZ88 really is a gem.  For starters, they have an amazing outdoor seating area with just the right amount of sun and shade. The outdoor seating is also comfortable, which was really, really nice to have after three 20 mile days. My poor, tired ass was thankful for those cushions. Thank you AZ88!  The service was very attentive and did not appear to judge us for the quantity of our celebratory consumption. May I recommend the Modern Presbyterian and the Bloody Mary? The mimosa was also good, but a tad on the small side. My friend and I spit one of their burgers, which are a half of a pound of meat, served with fruit, vegetables and a healthy dose of waffle fries. We thoroughly enjoyed every morsel and the burger was juicy and cooked perfectly.   Being a True Yelper (and just plain nosy), I inquired about what our neighbors had ordered. They were locals and had the bacon wrapped water chestnuts and a potato chip looking app with cream cheese and lox. They looked delicious, but I couldn't find room and there was shopping to be had. Definitely check out AZ88 if you fing yourself in the area.",

This is the place where I come for burgers & martinis.   First off, I love the modern decor of the restaurant.  Glass is everywhere and everything looks chic and clean.  The building itself is art.  Which fits in really well consideration they are next to the Scottsdale center of performing arts.  It's a cultural center for modern art and food.  Their martinis are really unique.  They fill the cocktail to the brim and have some some unique concoctions.  Worth the try.    Onto the made to order burgers.  Juicy as can be.  If you love bacon, try the burger au poivre 2 & burger las brisas gives you a southwestern flair.   Or stick with the original burger or cheeseburger. Their waffle fries are great as well.  No matter which burger you choose, you're in for a treat and be prepared to be stuffed afterwards.    I would stay away from the chicken sanwiches as the one I tried was a bit dry.  The have gluten free options & the kitchen is open until 12:30am, which is awesome if you want a late night meal.",

To me, everything on the menu was pedestrian, except for this one. A triple decker sandwich of your choice: 1) Chicken & Bacon 2) Chicken & Avocado, 3) Bacon & Avocado. Comes with lettuce, tomato, green pepper, cucumber and Hellmann's mayonnaise. Sliced hard-boiled egg upon request.   i asked the waiter to put chicken bacon and avocado in my two halves, and add the hard-boiled egg.  he got it done.  excellent work.  see pics!",

The last time we were there I had two very dirty forks with food stuck in them, and a glass with lipstick. The bacon wrapped water chestnuts have gone down in quality significantly over the years: burned bacon, smaller chestnuts, and dry dry dry. They used to be amazing... The second to last time I took family there, the ac was not working or was set really high, a huge problem in Arizona. With that said, the drinks are still pretty darn good!",

Really nice vibe, beautiful space with a truly elegant yet casual feel (who knew this was possible) and killer cocktails.  I learned how to slurp last night since your martini glass is filled so full you have no choice but to bend over the bar and slurp from your stemware!  Heard that that is how the bartenders can spot a newbie: newbies essentially spill all over the bar...or was I drunk by that second dirty martini?  Cannot wait to go back for a burger...and so damn close to Casa NR!",

    "text": "So, I've been wanting to try AZ 88 for awhile now, and this Friday this was the spot chosen for double date night... yay.  With all the hype about this place I felt like we were in for a treat, but unfortunately, we all left wondering what the heck everyone is talking about.  As far as the restaurant itself, it really is a cool place.  I loved the decor and I heard the bathroom was awesome (from the Hubs).  The patio and bar looked very inviting and were packed on a Friday night.  Our service was so-so.  I didn't think our waitress was too friendly, and it seemed like we were trying to cheer her up somehow... it was weird.  Also, my husband was served a flat beer, but she did replace it, which was nice.  The food itself wasn't anything special.  I did like my AZ 88 chicken sandwich, but everyone else wasn't impressed with what they got.  I found the side items that were served with the sandwiches somewhat odd- cold veggies, fries and some fruit...  Basically, I think I would go back just for drinks, but being this is a north Scottsdale bar they are quite expensive.  I'm pretty sure I'll just save my money for some of the other awesome restaurants in the Old Town area.",

    "text": "I love this place. I don't really know what else to say. You can sing the praises of any burger joint in town, but I haven't come across one that beats the flavor or the au poivre II - juicy beef, big enough for two, cracked peppercorns, thick cut bacon, wine sauteed onions plus blue cheese... it is a brilliant combination and has never disappointed, and I rarely even order a burger.   If you would prefer to skip the beef the AZ88 chicken is doused in buffalo sauce served on a bun with blue cheese (everything should be served with blue cheese) and is a great choice. If you'd like to forgo the beef and the bun, the AZ88 salad offers the same spicy buffalo chicken breast on top of the already well devised Four Season's salad, which offers a nice mix of fresh ingredients beyond your basic lettuces and tomatoes.   You can't review AZ88 without discussing the cocktails - well you could, but it would be a shame to overlook these tasty little concoctions. Actually, \"little\" isn't a word I would use to describe the adult beverages here. AZ88's martinis are legendary for their size. I've heard complaints about the cost of the drinks here, but you are getting a lot of bang for your buck in that martini glass. The liquid tests the laws of viscosity and your waiter's balance as it makes its way to your table. It is a real challenge to see if you can pick it up from the table in a smooth enough manner to keep all the liquid in the glass. My favorite stolen from AZ88 cocktail trick is to make cubes of frozen juices and cover them in vodka - no mixing required! This makes me look super slick when I have a party (shhh).  I just recently found out AZ88 is dog friendly on the patio, which just makes me love them all the more. I have a feeling my Italian greyhound will be a big fan of the burger and will also appreciate the fact that it's way too much for me to eat on my own.",

    "text": "Thank goodness I read the yelp reviews before going out to meet some friends here, or we would have NEVER found it. Ever.  Even with the tip about it being behind a big dirty parking garage, it took us a while, and then, we couldn't find the bloody entrance, not realizing that you had to go through the patio to get in. Ridiculous. Also, there are two 12\" square signs with the name of the place on it, hidden amongst climbing plants.  I guess they're going for the secret cool spot vibe.  Surprisingly, we (a group of 6) were sat fairly quickly on a Saturday night...it helped that we had a couple of 20-something stereotypically hot girls with us. We were on the patio, which was nice, and had interesting art (giant lit up potato wedges?) up above, but got pretty chilly around 10pm and there were not heaters.  The waiter?  Snarky, witty, and I loved him. Good service and just enough attitude to make it fun, but not have him be an asshole.  The drink prices? RIDICULOUS.  I shouldn't have to pay more than my meal to get a nice St. Germain drink ($14!) -- and all the drinks were served in pretty small glasses, including my iced tea, of which I needed about 7 million refills.  I did like the plethora of veggie options, and my partner liked the meaty choices. She went with a BBQ sandwich, while I opted for a dinette sized AZ 88 salad and the fries with dipping sauce.  The salad? HUGE, esp for $5, and delicious.  The fries? Almost as tasty as the dipping sauces.  I didn't like the spicy ketchup, but the remolade and the buffalo blue cheese? To DIE for. Yum! All 6 members of our table gobbled their meals.  The furniture was interesting...not super comfy, but sit-able.  The women's bathroom? Odd. Really odd.  Mirrors all over, and splashes or urine on the mirrors next to the toilet as if the mirrors had confused someone as to where to actually to pee.  I did, however, LOVE the gender neutral bathroom, and how queer friendly the whole place was.  Versus the rest of Scottsdale, my partner and I actually felt like we fit in.  While the drink prices were outrageous, the rest of the stuff wasn't, and we'd totally come back, especially now that we know where it is.  Also, their music selection was excellent!  We found out they had a live DJ spinning, and how amazing is that?",

The \"Hot Pepper Chicken\" sandwich has a chicken breast that is marinated in lime juice, and is topped with jalapenos and honey.  Cool bar along with a good food menu gives AZ 88 four stars.",

I go back and then back again for the Burger Au' Prove (burger with peppercorn sauce).  Meat is quality, buns are fresh and the sauce makes that burger mouth-watering wonderful.  Before this I will usually order the civiche or Hell Fire chips for the table.  The chips are fresh and I have been introduced to a wonderful hot sauce called Arizona Gun Slinger.  The civiche is fresh and loaded with shrimp, tomatoes, onions, cilantro and lemon all to be piled onto fresh cooked white tortilla chips.

They keep the bathroom entrance dark with a neon light you enter your stall and it's COMPLETELY MIRRORED. Who whats to watch oneself go? I don't, but I noticed my butt looked better than I thought it would. This stall looked to me like a place for SEXUAL ENCOUNTERS. Going back out to the dining room I then had a better understanding of the artwork. I saw abstract torso's , butts in the air painted red on the windows and saw naked women rolling around under sheets on the bar wall. (but we already ordered ordered before I noticed all this the butts bothered me not the other stuff)  THE FOOD  You HAVE TO SHARE your sandwich with someone because it is 8 oz. if you have some sort of chicken sandwich (approx $10) but then you can add the extra sides (approx $3) so the other person can have a full platter. For two people approx $13 for two reasonably nice meals (unless you are creep ed out by the bathroom or art work)  We shared the chicken with hot peppers and honey sandwich it came on a bun and was served with large house made waffle fries and was garnished with 1/2 a large radish ,a broccoli ,one carrot finger , two small melon wedges and a pickle spear.  For me this sandwich was a little too sweet and would have picked  a different one I might have liked better if not sharing. The sandwich bun seemed maybe fresh made but didn't seem like an Italian Roll listed on menu . My fries were almost cold and the fruit slices were sort of dry.My iced tea was (I think) passion fruit flavored, it was a surprise that not all people would be OK with.  The food overall was OK meaning not bad but not great just OK and not expensive. This place isn't for everyone.",

    "text": "I visited AZ88 with my fiancee, our cousins from El Mirage and a pair of friends from Peoria while visiting Arizona. They had all been here and the cozy hot spot came highly recommended.  We all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Four of us arrived early and parked adjacent to the restaurant (and the nearby Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art). We walked around the beautifully-landscaped exterior of AZ88, and eventually settled in.  It is a wonderful and beautiful space, complete with rotating art exhibits. We had a back corner seat with the booths that reclined... amazing! We were greeted immediately by the manager, and our waiter. We started with two appetizers: Hell's Fire Chips with the bleu cheese on the side, and the Dipping Waffle Fries with dip trio. I enjoyed both, especially the spicy chili ketchup on the fries which was in the dip trio.  I started with one of their artisan-crafted martinis which was delicious, large, and filled to the brim. I followed that with a cocktail recommended by the waiter, also great.  For my meal, I ordered the eponymously-named Cheeseburger. It is created to order with your choice of American, Swiss, Cheddar, or Colby cheese... or all four. I opted for all four. There were a variety of toppings available, and I selected grilled onions. I had the burger cooked medium. It was ok... not a great burger. I think it might be a pre-made patty? Or just a bland beef mix... it was the only not-so-great thing about the experience. The burger, for me, kept it from being five stars.  My vegetarian fiancee ordered a Four Seasons Salad with grilled shrimp and goat cheese. She found it to be superior.  The other guests unanimously enjoyed their meals as well as the drinks and appetizers.  The bathrooms were also very upscale (although a bit dark). I was told that the female restroom was equally clean, though much brighter.  The waiter provided superior service with a bit of fun, adding to the conversation and making some light-hearted jokes with us. After the meal, we departed and I realized I had left my phone. By the time we called, the manager had locked it in the office and welcomed our return to claim it. He was quick and helpful while helping us reclaim the phone.  All-in-all... four stars. It's a beautiful restaurant with good food, great service and an excellent bar.",

    "text": "I've wanted to check this place out for a long time and I was not disappointed. This is where I will bring my out of town friends to prove to them that Arizona is cool. Despite being relatively small the high ceiling and bay windows give the place an open airy feeling. The atmosphere is chill, cool and classy. They play good music and the drinks while not cheap are good and strong the way I like 'em. I had a good buzz going after two vodka sodas and a beer. I did of course have two cocktails and a beer BEFORE coming here so cumulative damage was already in effect.  The patio is AWESOME with cool leather chairs with reclining back rests My inner scenesta was a cool and sophisticated yet happy camper.  This is another place any Arizonan sick of the casual scene can dress up (the place is still casual so you don't have to get too dressed up) and have a nice, stylish night out. The agenda would be: have dinner at Distrito, then stroll across the way to AZ88 and savor some high end beverages-take your time, enjoy the vibe and savor your drink-like I said.....the drinks ain't cheap. Then when you're good and buzzed and feel like behaving in appropriately, that's when you head over to the Coach House to ride out the downward spiral. Not a bad way to do brunch either if you're ok with being passed out by 7:00pm. Bottom line, this is a great place to come with friends for a classy night or at least a classy START to the night in Scottsdale.",

Fun bathrooms (and I mean fun in a clean way...), a changing art showpiece and the overly-conscious fashionable crowd make for some fascinating gawking.   It's usually loud and crowded esp. Thursday - Saturday nights, and finding the greeter/host(ess) is always an annoying toss-up.  Do you check in out in the front patio, or in the bar entrance?  You NEVER really know until you find yourself having to flag someone down.  Service is expectedly so-so.  Food is decent.  I usually get the 7353 club sandwich with chicken bacon and avocado - very delish.  And waffle fries?  Yum.  Drinks are pricey but done well.  Fancy martinis are upwards of $13...",

Cool art, modern space, unique/fun drinks, pretty people and good food!  Since there was a wait we decided to hang out at the bar and order drinks.  I think I ordered maybe the gayest drink on the menu...I mean it had sugar confetti in it and champagne!  We also ordered the fries with the three dipping sauces...really good and I loved that they were waffle fries!  When we got to our table, Sandra ordered her usual chicken dish, Danielle got a salad and I got the cheeseburger.  Everything was great and I liked that you got sides of fries and fruit.    The night even got better when I ordered a Caprihana and they gave it to me with a pink sugar stick...seriously this plays KNOWS ME!",

This was a very good combination and tasty. My wife order grilled cheese that she liked very much. One strange thing is they give you a selection of \"fruits and vegetables\" with your sandwich. So I had a slice of pineapple, piece of broccoli, a baby carrot etc with my fries. I ordered a diet coke, which they brought an 8 oz bottle and glass. But then I was asked if I wanted more and they gave me soda from the bar tap. Not sure why the first one was bottled and the refill was from fountain soda",

It was chopped ,grilled, portobellos on dry bread with tomato. It tasted like a dirt sandwich. My boyfriend got the burger pouvre or whatever it's called, and it was so \"encrusted\" with pepper that you couldn't taste anything but pepper. He said he had a stomachache afterward. I don't  think they even care if it tastes good. I wish I would have just ordered french fries, because they were the only thing worth eating. \"Would you like a box\"? No, thank you. Words cannot express how terrible the food was, and I generally will eat anything.",

    "text": "I need to preface first by saying that I have always looked forward to an evening at AZ88. It was the first \"cool\" restaurant I ever visited before moving to Phoenix.  Last night, however, was an extremely disappointing experience. My party of 7 arrived at 8:15pm for drinks and dinner. Drinks took a very long time to arrive to the table, and we finally ordered food at 8:50pm. As we sat with empty drinks (every single person in the party), we noticed all tables around us, which had arrived after us, getting food. We finally said something to our server at about 9:40pm. Drinks are still empty at this point. When our food arrived 5 minutes later (almost an hour wait, without new drinks, of course), fries and sandwiches were cold. We were told the manager was going to \"fix\" things (whatever that meant), and come check in with us. Manager never came. Nothing was ever fixed, except for 2 plates of hot fries. We were offered free dessert, but by that point we didn't feel like risking additional wait.  Being a server in the past myself, I understand issues happen, especially on a Friday night. It was disappointing though to see that no True or genuine effort was taken to fix the experience on part of the manager. It was the first time I felt insulted to even expect to leave a tip considering the $35 bill and disappointing experience. My apologies to the server, but I could only leave 10%. Perhaps you can ask your manager for the remaining 10-15% I would 99.9% of the time leave a server.",

I would have given it 4 stars, had the service not been so awful.  :(  Our waiter was too hip to be bothered to do his job properly- um- hello, you're a waiter!- and acted as though he was annoyed to wait on us.  It seemed we were always waiting for something- napkins, water, the bill!  On the upside, we sat outside and this place has an awesome patio!  I ordered the picnic chicken and switched out the pumpernickel bread for wheat.  It was really good, reasonably priced,  and came with a mound of fruit!   Overall, not a bad experience- I would probably try it again and hope for a different waiter! :)",

    "text": "AZ-88 was the first place I had dinner / drinks when I moved to Scottsdale (per suggestion of a friend). After returning at a later date for a second round I figured I'd give this review thing a shot...  At first glance all outward appearances of AZ-88 point to that of your typical swanky-ish lounge. Both times I've been there the decor was very minimalistic, though I am told that there is a change in themes every month or two. There is a decent sized patio in the front equipped with table sets and couches indicative of the lounge theme and inside you can find seats at the bar, table sets, couches, or the reclining booth benches that run the perimeter. The music was of the repetitive bass beat, techo-ish, club style.. and I know they have a DJ at least a few nights a week. It wasn't too bad, or overly loud.  I've ate both times that I have been here and both times I have been impressed. The food was great, and the wait staff attentive. I'd definitely recommend the burgers if you're not into that whole \"meat is murder\" thing and want to venture away from the usual sushi or salads routine of Scottsdale. Another thing about the food is that it is quite reasonably priced and portions are huge.   I stuck to the basics ordering up a Jameson on the rocks. For the $8 price tag I assumed I would receive a 3 oz rocks glass half filled with this sweet nectar of the Gods. To my surprise (and joy) what I received was a regular well tumbler glass filled to the brim... SCORE! Yes, they do have some pricey drinks ($12 - $14 martinis) but for the most part the drinks menu seemed to be reasonably priced. (Hey, If you want a $2 beer stick to your local dive) You get what you pay for and they obviously have to make up for the inexpensive food somewhere.   The location of AZ-88 is a bit off the beaten path which can be looked at two ways, either it's a pain to find (which I could understand) or a hidden gem. I'll go with the latter; at least there is plenty of parking in the near-by garage. The draw-back; the location is probably why I haven't been here on a Friday or Saturday night (yet).  I've only been here on weeknights so I am hesitant to speak to the local talent level in attendance, but, I will. In all honesty I didn't see much. In typical Scottsdale fashion there were a few ladies wearing full on evening dresses (on a Monday night) in this casual-ish establishment but there wasn't really much to speak about in that department. Saving grace - This place is supposedly packed on the weekends, so I'll have to check back for the report.   All in all I would say it is definitely a place worth trying, I know I will make it back again.   Bonus Points - If this is your first time, have fun trying to find the restrooms.",

Cautiously spinning around, you noticed you are being gawked at, judged, mulled, and brooded by others.  You audaciously, head over to the bench press, unveil your biceps through your wife beater, stack two 45s on each side ...  ... and then the drum and bass music begins.    So goes AZ 88.  The Bar as The Yard.  The Socialites are The Felons.  The Vertical Striped Uniforms portraying the Horizontal Striped Uniforms.  And the bench press is your financial cache.  All of this is precisely why I love this place.  It is like entering the world's most cosmopolitan penitentiary during visiting hours, where you get to enjoy the fascinating aspects of a sad existence and still, they let you leave afterwards, retreating to your happy, humble life in the clear.  All the while, you can enjoy some fantastic waffle fries and a Moscow Mule and sit in the cozy furniture on the other side of the glass not intended for the habitue.  Yes, in fact, AZ88 IS a fun time, as long as one doesn't make it his hard-knock life.   Visit occasionally.  They have unique drinks in an unusual environment.  House DJs and a cleverly ironic menu to wrinkle the expectations of it all.  Just be cogent not to get absorbed into the S'dale lifers.",

    "text": "This is probably one of the more unique, trendy looking places in Phoenix-metro to lounge at.  Everything about AZ88 is eye-candy, literally., from the furniture to the drinks to the decor and of course, the patrons.  Drinks are made really, really tasty.  My usual choice of cocktail is the French 75.  My go-to appetizer is either the waffle fries that comes with three flavorful dipping sauces or the shrimp ceviche! The menu is pretty diverse with a little flair.  What makes this place a hit for me are the contemporary, artsy decor making it a refreshing scene to come to compared to other Phoenix-ish ambiance.  Of course, you can't have all these modern, sophisticated attributes without a DJ playing fresh beats and sounds!   Bottom line is the look and the vibe makes me feel like I am back in New York or Los Angeles.  I had given a 4-star prior, but I can honestly say AZ88 can hang with the big boys.",

I went with two of my friends for some appetizers and drinks this past Friday and it was so yummy. We ordered the fries with the 3 dipping sauces, the galletes, and the bacon wrapped water chestnuts. Everything was very good and provided a great base for the drinking that was going on.  While the drinks were rather pricey, they were very good. You get about a drink and a half if you order a martini. My girlfriend and I ordered pomegranate martinis and they were just divine! I loved that they weren't sweet and syrupy like I usually get.   Go there to get the night started with some yummy apps and GREAT people watching. I don't care if the men are gay or straight, they were HOT and dressed fabulously!   Can't wait to hit AZ88 again!",

Maybe the decision to decorate an entire wall with the quote \"Smoking is the number one cause of statistics.\" now that's funny - so funny it should get its own wall. The food? Well, there's bacon on everything, or it's fried. I think it tries to be an attempt at that New American, fusion thing ... so this place went for a fusion of Denny's and Del Taco. Now that's fine, but not for more than 2.99. So why 3 stars? BECAUSE THE BATHROOMS ARE AMONG THE MOST AMAZING PLACES IN THE WORLD. Go for the bathrooms. The girls room: brightly lit with mirrors on opposite walls, projecting your ass into eternity. I mean, fuck that is awesome. The men's room: dimly lit, with many mirrors, but not on opposing walls. While your bits may not be projected ad infinitum into another dimension, you are guaranteed to have a deeply erotic wee.",

    "text": "My dad and I came here just to grab a pre-dinner drink and ended up having a snack too. What a trendy/chic place! It felt very NYC (as I learned later, it has a sister restaurant in NYC). I loved the ambiance - very high ceilings, fun lighting, huge mirrors on the wall, and funky seating.   We sat in what I called the 'date booth' which was a funny red couch in the middle of the place - perfectly appropriate for just grabbing a drink, but it would definitely be awkward for having dinner. After purusing the cocktail list I was delighted to see a number of interesting cocktails, dubbed 'classic cocktails', and each had the cocktail's inventor and date of invention. I love that stuff! I settled on a Saint Germain (with elderberry liquor - I had it at a party once and loved it!) and dad got a caiparinha. We also got the flatbread (sans bacon).   Both the cocktails were a delight. Dad's caipirhina came with rock candy !!!!! and mine tasted like bubble gum (in a good way). The flatbread was also tasty, especially once we put some AZ hot sauce on top!  $40 incl tip for 2 cocktails and an app, a bit pricey but we did get expensive cocktails. The menu didn't look too bad though, $-wise.  note: bathrooms are cool too. hard to locate though! very camo.",

Moscow mules and very dirty martinis provided more than enough lubrication for the evening.  He even brought out a shot of a liquor I'd never heard of on the house! We had a burger and chicken sandwich, both of which were very tasty. Fun people watching, cool decor and slightly hidden bathrooms all add up to a quirky but solid evening out. Check this place out for sure!",

    "text": "AZ88 gets 5 stars for having the best Buffalo Chicken Sandwich in all of Arizona.  It is incredible.  Messy as hell but incredible nonetheless.  Oh, and just when you thought it couldn't get any better, it comes with waffle fries...WAFFLE FRIES people!!!!  It also comes with a delightful little fruit salad and slightly tangy ketchup which is to die for!  I go to AZ88 anytime I want to have a nice swanky time and don't want to pay an arm and a leg for it.  it is the perfect place to have any sort of celebration because it is kind to people of all budgets.  Don't get me wrong, if you want to spend a crap load of $$, AZ88 will be more than happy to oblige!  Their cocktails are all quite pricey but they are HUGE and potent, so I excuse them for that.  But if you are just there to eat or have a drink or two, you can easily get out of there for $20, which isn't too shabby.  I go for lunch all the time and sit at the bar and hang with Jamel, my fave daytime bartender, as we sit, watch, and laugh at all the people who are confused by the HE/SHE bathrooms and can't figure out how to get in them. Just push open the door people...  The lunch crowd is quite eclectic, but the dinner crowd is very different.  They rather match the modern and voyeuristic design of AZ88.  Basically what I'm getting at, is these people want to be seen, and they want to be seen specifically in AZ88.  But again, we all have our moments (especially in PHX) where we want to pretend we're someone and somewhere else and AZ88 is the perfect place to provide said transport.",

    "text": "I will start by saying that when I give a five star review, it means that I love everything about a place and can't wait to return. So is the case with AZ88. The menu is straightforward American food - burgers, sandwiches, salads, etc. But the thing is, they do these 'simple' foods perfectly. The cocktails are great (and strong) as well, but food is definitely center stage here.   They have an au poivre burger that is amazing. As soon as I read the description, I just had to have it. It's a 1/2 pound burger with a peppercorn crust (not sure if I remember if it's grilled or not) with a caramelized onion red wine reduction. I ordered the version that also added blue cheese and bacon - great burger classics. For some reason medium-rare burgers usually come to you almost well done at most places. Not here; the burger was cooked perfectly and was super juice. The flavor combinations were perfect and I couldn't put it down. The burger was accompanied by great waffle fries. Waffle fries are the best choice - crispy and crunchy.   Another favorite is the chicken-bacon club. OK, so you probably think, \"What can be so special about a club sandwich?\" This club was well thought out and should set the standard for all club sandwiches. First, the bread is thin and lightly toasted so as not to tear your mouth apart as well as providing a better balance to the other ingredients. The chicken was fresh cooked breasts sliced, layered with amazing smoky thick-cut bacon, just the right amount of lettuce, tomato, and cucumber (yes, cucumber). They also slice the sandwich in half (not quarters). So smart as it totally helps keeping the sandwich together when you eat it.   The decor is very cool as well. The restaurant is one big room with soaring ceiling. The entire front is constructed of all glass and steel and the great bar runs the entire side wall. The interior of the room itself is has lots of mirrors and eclectic decor but feels trendy, modern, and now. They also have a very cool front patio to enjoy when it's not too hot.   I can't wait to eat my way through the menu. Unfortunately I don't live in Scottsdale, but looking forward to my next visit.",

    "text": "There are a million reviews for this place, but I need this for my list- okay?  This is one of my friend's favorite places. She moved to New York and so I decided to go here in her honor. Also, so I could rub it in... then, she told me about Bar 89 in NY.  I guess it's basically the same thing, but even better.  So, I have to tell you. I love the Pineapple Martini. It's just pretty to look at. A girl next to me watched as I took my first sip and immediately changed her order. You all know that I make love to cupcakes, so imagine what I do to martinis.    I also tried a Pimm's Cup for the first time and loved it. It's so refreshing and hard to describe. It doesn't hurt that it's served in a copper mug either.  To top it off, the food is pretty good. I ordered the BLT with avocado and it came with waffle fries. Why does the waffle shape make fries taste so much better? Seriously, I can't resist fries in the shape of a waffle. I've also tried the St. Petersburg potatoes- I like anything with cream cheese and salmon, so those are always a go.   I was only going to give this place 4 stars, but then I remembered two things: You can't beat the drinks at AZ88 and the host has to somehow remember what faces go to each name on the list. I was impressed that he was able to do that. It gets packed on a Friday night and he not only finds you in that sea of people, but he also remembers who you actually are. I'd just be running around yelling at everyone because I'd have no idea what the Johnson party looked like.",

They change the inside frequently and it's always really cool and surprising. One time they had a bunch of manikin legs descending from the ceilings, suspended by lengthened fishnet stockings. Awesome.  It's a little hard to find; you can't see the entrance from the most convenient parking spots.  Try it once, see you if you like it...if you're not at least able to tolerate \"the scene\" you won't be impressed.",

Entrees: 1) Burger Au Poivre II (with peppercorns, crumbled bleu cheese & bacon) 2) Picnic Chicken Sandwich (sliced chicken breast, sliced pears, pecan halves, Gorgonzola cheese, mayonnaise, mustard and Romaine lettuce on pumpernickel bread) Both were very good, and the portions were big. The waffle fries that came with it were very good, and I liked that they included some fruit on the side.  Drinks: 1) Dirty martini: strong but made very well. I couldn't decide what kind of olives I wanted so he gave me one of each 2) French martini: one of the better ones I have tasted  The ambiance is very trendy, both on the inside and outside.

You have the best drinks (ok I've only tried one type of drink), wonderful food (ok, ok...I've only tried one sandwich) and excellent people watching (THIS I can attest to)...and the bathrooms are crazy. I personally like the Pink girls bathroom...oh and the Unisex one is cool too!   Apparently a lot of \"architects\" hang out here...at least I overheard 3 tool-bags say LOUDLY (of course just loud enough for the ladies nearby to overhear) that they were architects. Do women really fall for that? My intellect says the dumb ones do. Ironically enough, I was meeting a friend there who IS an architect...so he and I had some fun with that. The next few times that I went there was a great mix of people...so don't let the architect thing sway you.   Ok...here's the down low. I HAD to order a Grey Goose martini dirty with blue cheese olives...and it was DEE-LISH! Seriously, one of the better martinis I've had in town. And come to think of it, it's the only drink I've had the 4 times I've been there. Ha! I guess I'm a creature of habit.   Now to the food...you must try the AZ 88 Chicken Sandwich. It's a grilled chicken breast smothered in hot wing sauce, blue cheese dressing and sauteed celery (similar to pickles...but not as tangy). I struggle with trying anything new because this sandwich is so good. It is messy and drippy and amazing! I have also had a bit of the Au Poivre burger and that was really good too...but I love my little spicy, drippy sandwich!   Lastly, they have super cute bartenders. They pour strong drinks, give suggestions on the menu (even though I don't listen) and even shared with us the best nights to stop in. Thursdays are apparently not too busy from what I could tell. Oh yes, and they serve dinner late! They are open until 1:30am for drinks every night of the week and the kitchen is open until 12:30 every night. Ha! Check this place out...you will love it!",

We both figured they would say no, but to our dismay, they said yes!  We were psyched!  Minnie was too... especially when they sat us 10 minutes later (we thought the wait would be longer on a Friday night) and brought her a dog bowl filled with ice water.  Score!  Justin, our server, took amazing care of us.  We stuck with water for once, but our water glasses stayed full throughout the entire time we were there.  We started with the veggie plate as an appetizer to share and it was awesome!  J went with the BLT and I had the portabella mushroom sandwich - both came with the traditional AZ 88 garnish (fruit and veggies) and waffle fries - yum!  We had a really pleasant evening sitting on the patio, taking in the scene, chilling with Minnie, and enjoying delicious food and service.  AZ 88 was far better than I remembered it - I will be back again and again I'm sure... next time I'll try that Moscow Mule that Nadia wrote about!",

Great food, good service, STRONG drinks, interesting and lively ambiance, just an overall amazing experience...time after time. I've never been let down at AZ88.  Plan ahead for a ride home though. AZ88 doesn't mess around with their drinks. STIFF. But good. I ordered a rum & coke this last time; and they brought me a highball glass just about full of rum with a small bottle of coke next to it. Basically more than a double pour of rum for a 'normal' rum & coke! And their martinis are strong too! Rent a limo, call a cab, have a DD, but be prepared if you drink here.  I've sampled a bunch from the menu, but usually settle on the burgers these days. Sooo filling! And delicious. You won't be disappointed...with anything you order. I more than recommend this place; I swear by it.",

The menu is wonderful and creative with everything from tasty and healthy sandwiches and salads to decadent, sinful desserts. Additionally, the bartender on staff the night of our visit shook a mean Kettle One martini! (Okay, a few of them!) The outside patio couches call to you during the evening, and the ambiance is first class. Special note: Be sure to hit the restroom on your visit... trust me! ;)",

I am personally not a fan of blue cheese so I substituted ranch and it was delicious.  The chicken breast is not fried and almost tastes blackened with a perfect buffalo sauce with pieces of celery on top.  I was feeling indulgent and got it with the fries which were cooked perfectly but tried some of the grilled vegetables from another plate at my table and wish I had chosen them.  The grilled vegetables have almost a smokey flavor and are cooked to perfection.  Cant wait to visit scottsdale again to swing by and have another one of these sandwiches.",

The fat-free raspberry blended together nicely with the bitterness of the spouts in the salad.   The service can be sort of slow.

I guess its electro-pop but unless you go there every day, once in a while or on vacation like us, the music is actually quite catchy, fun , and great music.   We had a salty dog and a mojito. My wife was in love with her drink (grapefruit vodka, fresh grapefruit juice, himalayn sea salt rim) and my mojito was the best ever! Very tall glass with an XL straw and generous sprigs of mint inside tells me they know what there pouring/serving. A+++ for knowledgeable bartenders.  Food was great overall. Waffle fries were great with 3 sauces. Galettes were simple but bacon, olives, and cheese on a soda cracker is pushing it for 9$.   We had the au poivre II burger. Massive burger coated with blk pepper, red onions, blue chz, bacon!!  The burger and drinks were amaZing!!  Overall, as out of towners visiting from CT we loved this place and will be back!!  A+",

I usually rave about the food first but I'm going to RAVE about our server for the evening, Rebecca. She was probably the nicest, kindest and professional server I've ever had in my entire life. From start to finish she was on top of EVERYTHING. We never had a half full glass of water and never had to ask for anything because she knew EXACTLY what we needed. By far, hands down the BEST service I've had. If you go to AZ 88, ask for Rebecca, you will NOT be disappointed.  Now, the food! Shrimp ceviche was absolutely amazing as an appetizer as was the dipping ries with all the amazing sauces you get with it. Must try appetizers for sure. The bonfire chicken dish was amazing, so full of flavor and the chicken was so tender and melts in your mouth. Cheeseburgers are WONDERFUL, the meat is so tender and once again, tons of flavor, however, I wish it was served on a better bun.   A very chic, romantic and modern place. You MUST try AZ 88 and don't forget to have Rebecca as your server!",

Everyone in here was dressed like they were going out to a club in Vegas   Cool drink menu. Pimms cup was yummy but was mostly ice. My friend had the espresso martini she said was powerful and yummy  My friend ordered the smoked salmon platter. It came with lots of stuff but looked pretty boring  I ordered the galette. It was literally Lavash bread toasted to a cracker state topped with a little bacon, carmelized onion and light sprinkle of pre grated cheese and excessive amount of black olives. I ate it cuz I was hungry but it tasted like something I could throw together at home from leftovers around the house. It came with random slices of unripe tomato as garnish.   If you want this galette to taste better chefs: you should brush it with some garlic flavored olive oils, get rid of the olives, add a bit more cheese that you grate yourself and sprinkle chives. Or better yet, make your own flat bread dough",

I ordered an aviation, a drink I order everywhere as it's my favorite. Last night I did the same and received a gin drink, but the incorrect one on the menu that happened to be green. I asked the server if I could get the aviation I ordered and she politely said yes and allowed me to keep the one I was given in the process as well. When she came back with the \"aviation\" she told me this was their aviation and she was mistaken for telling me it wasn't beforehand. However, I have not only consumed many aviations, I've also made them as a bartender for over 8 years. These drinks are purple as they contain Creme de Violette, which is a deep blue/purple color. My drinks I was given were green with cucumbers in them...this is because they were the other gin cocktail on their menu. I would not be as bitter as I am had she not charged me for both drinks. This is an inaccurate representation of AZ88, but it shouldn't happen and I shouldn't have to call a waitress out on her knowledge of the menu.",

    "text": "The year is 1979. Brothers Ronald Bell and Robert \"Kool\" Bell have been making a nice living on the R&B charts with the rest of the band, affectionately called \"The Gang.\" Then, like a holy pop-funk messenger sent from heaven, a Mr. J.T. Taylor joins the gang and what follows is an album that will change the face of music, men, and background tunes at sporting events across the country. I'm talking about Celebration.  Celebrate good times, come on! (Let's celebrate) Celebrate good times, come on! (Let's celebrate)  There's a party goin' on right here A celebration to last throughout the years So bring your good times, and your laughter too We gonna celebrate your party with you  What does this have to do with AZ 88? Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce and explore the magic of the Celebration Champagne. They bring you a flute of champagne and then add a teensy spoon full of sugar. What follows is like the liquid version of the 1980 Kool & The Gang hit \"Celebration.\" Slowly the sugar crystals sink, and then the bubbles form in the champagne, and it slowly rises up to the rim of your glass. I've witnessed both small and erupting bubbles. But the last time I was there I was witness to what may be described as a #1 Billboard hit bubble. It rose nearly a half inch above the rim of the flute and never spilled a drop over the side. It was brilliant.   One does not simply listen to \"Celebration\" without singing along and dancing. In like manner, one does not order the Celebration Champagne, watch the bubble magic, and maintain silence. It must be enjoyed out loud. Woo, holler, yeehaw, shout, yay or otherwise make some noise. Do it from your soul. Love it.  The vibe here is spot-on. Enough music to cater to some privacy, but not one of those places that you have to shout. Relaxed. Upscale without being snooty. The patio is perfect. I've sat out there for drinks and I've also enjoyed it during a January lunch. Cobb salad, friends. Cobb salad.  There's a party going on right there. A celebration, you might say, to last throughout the years (since 1988). Bring your good times, and your laughter too. They're gonna celebrate and party with you.",

I came here dressed to the nines with good friends to have a drink, and to admire the amazing Art installations. To people watch, flirt and *be seen*, ya dig?  Maybe catch a glimpse of a celebrity in town. (This is not a fine dining experience, if that is what you are expecting, I'd recommend the Biltmore, up the road a little, baby.)  The food reminded me of a decent corporate chain akin to perhaps a Chili's or TGIFriday's. And that's cool, because AZ88 has always been one of the very few enduring staples for adventurous Scottsdale nightlifers.  Arizonans with open minds gather here to talk the latest Art, music, culture, gossip and politics. They have always showcased incredible Art here to dazzle and mesmerize the eyes.  This is a must see for anyone visiting Scottsdale for the first time.  So if you *are visiting*, get dressed in your best, and head over any night (Saturdays about 8ish were when I usually popped in) and be prepared to experience some enchanting excitement and laid back fun at this gleaming, decadent desert Oasis.( I have a thousand memories of AZ88 and not one of them bad.

I love bacon and blue cheese burgers and especially like them when I can get them medium rare, they cooked it just right. Now this burger also has a bit of a spice to it as the patty itself had peppercorns in it (most establishments use peppercorn bacon). I would most definitely come here again as they made the perfect dirty vodka martini to compliment my burger.  Great atmosphere, good food and happy tastebuds.",

My bf and I typically like to come here earlier in the day for happy hour before the dinner/night rush as it tends to get pretty packed. I  give it 4 stars because it can get packed and hard to find a seat esp. at the bar. Also, not all bartenders seem to make the martinis the same which is a bit disappointing. It's also pricey but you definitely get 2 for the price of one with the size of drink. They fill those glasses to the brim! Worth checking out!

The decor is modern with windows up to the ceiling, but with what I interpreted as a disco feel. As soon as we were seated we all realized how sweltering hot it was. Our poor server arrived with a long sleeved shirt, and tie, buttoned up to to her neck, dripping sweat. We asked if the air conditoning was broken since we were seriously debating on leaving. The children were red faced and sweating, people around us were fanning themselves and did not look comfortable. Our server tried her best to explain she \"wasn't quite sure why it was so warm\". I ordered a salad with seared tuna added and it was pretty tasty. Our server was clearly busy, and uncomfortably hot but provided good service. In the end we decided to have her send over the manager to see what he had to say about the air and were shocked at his response. Aparently, he stated that the normal temp runs \"82-85 degrees because of the windows and AC unit they have.\" Say what?? This is AZ!! Maybe a poorly designed building? Overall, he tried to apologize, and comped my friends bill for their children but we were just not impressed.",

    "text": "A friend who is a local decided on AZ88 for our recent Friday night dinner.  Beautiful place with floor to ceiling windows looking out on a spacious patio, which is where we were sat.  The joint was jumping, and close to capacity at prime time but they quickly found us a table for 6, as they don't take rezzez. It's one of those trendy type places where the staff is a tad aloof, and smiles are only for special occasions. While waiting for our table we were standing off to the side of the patio sipping our drinks, when a cocktail waitress came up in my grill with a semi-aggressive \"are you smoking?\" With no hesitation I replied, \"yeah, smokin hot.\" Apparently not an occasion to offer a smile, as she just walked away without comment. I later ran into her and asked her why she thought I was smoking, and she said she thought she smelled smoke, but we shared a subdued laugh and made peace. Weird.   From the restos appearance the menu was not what I expected as it's brief on entree's and heavy on sandwiches, burgers, and salads. Some of the menu descriptions are amusing and a tad over the top, so I copied my menu choice as an example;  S.S.S.  Our smoked salmon is caught in the pristine waters of Scotland, then smoked and hand-packed at the St. James smokehouse, a stone's throw from the river. We serve it open-faced with pumpernickel bread, red onion, cream cheese, cornichons, capers, fresh-sliced radish, and a little lemon. $16.00  How could I resist? Loved every pristine water fresh bite, although I probably would have preferred rye as the pumpernickel was a little overpowering. I also ordered what I thought was a one serving size salad, and it was huge, with all ingredients farm fresh. My other dining mates enjoyed their menu selections as well.  Be sure to visit the trippy restroom, see my pic. Flashback worthy!  All in all a very good time was had, and would be happy to return, especially on a similar perfect desert evening.",

We were initially at a large table but were easily accommodated by the server when our group size changed.  The space is absolutely beautiful and inspiring artwork is displayed. The food and drinks were great but not nearly as inspiring menu choices  as the atmosphere and art was.  We lingered for while conversing after paying the bill but our server disappeared and we decided to order desert. After waiting for a while and looking around I finally went up to the bar, requested a desert menu and took it back to the table. Still no server so I went back to the bar and requested for our table.  Otherwise the evening went pretty smooth.",

The house chips were delicious, could use more seasoning or salt but just dipped them into the leftover ranch dressing. The ice tea was also pretty good, although I had to keep asking for a refill as the server was not really aware I needed more or even asked I wanted more to drink. Total bill was $47 with tax for two lunches and tea. After tax and tip $30 each!!!",

However the bar tender with the long grayish  beard made up for it. He was hilarious! He checked on us often and made a mean Tito's dirty martini. I will definitely be back, hopefully a new installation will be out. I like food, I like a good cocktail and I love art.",

We arrived around 815 on a Friday night and were told it would be a 45 minute wait. No problem, we went to the bar for cocktails. I had the English Garden and my boyfriend had a mojito. The drinks were STRONG and delicious and the bartenders were very friendly. The cocktail menu had nothing unique though. It was your typical lemon drop, cosmopolitan, margarita, etc.   We enjoyed people watching while we sipped our cocktails and 45 minutes later we were seated. The menu reads like a sports bar. We decided to split the buffalo chicken sandwich and the Asian shrimp dish. The buffalo chicken sandwich was fine, but it was served with waffle fries and cut up melon slices. It just seemed so weird to me to be eating that while the DJ is bumping overhead. The Asian shrimp dish was just not good. It was bland, overpriced and boring.   Am I missing something? I had had this restaurant bookmarked for awhile and felt a little let down. Let me know Yelpers!",

I'll admit, it took me a second visit to appreciate AZ88. At first, I disliked everything. I felt like they were trying too hard. Like they had an identity crisis. Perhaps they do, but just like your crazy Aunt Theresa that decides to take up pole dancing at 55, you accept and love them for what they are.   AZ88 is simplistic and modern. It's a giant glass window space that feels more art exhibit than restaurant. With changing installations you never know what to expect.   The cocktail menu is fabulous. On trend. On par. And perfectly priced. You can order a giant martini for the price of a 7-11 Big Gulp (well, almost).   If you happen upon a weekend evening you'll be pleased to find a live DJ. This did me and the BF in. This smooth moving DJ was able to blend classic Mo-town with Biggie gangsta rap. And with ease. As music festival junkies-we know good music and good DJ's. And whoever was spinning last weekend needs to get signed ASAP. Dude was perfection. He probably made a few babies that night too!  Food is simple. It's ironically simple. Burgers. Chicken sandwiches. You don't really visit AZ88 for the food. It's the cocktails (massive martinis!) and legendary DJ's. I could see myself hanging here until the wee hours just chilling and enjoying the sights and sounds.   It's an experience. Understand that before you visit and your expectations will change.",

Dale still recognizes and welcomes me by name.  And gosh, you truly have the best chicken club sandwich in the entire world.   Don't ever change.  You're my favorite Scottsdale restaurant.  Sheer perfection for high quality comfort food.  I'll be back soon!",

It's very retro-chic with it's big glass doors, and white bar/walls/tables/chairs...it felt like I was in the future.    With that being said, I thought their food would follow the motif.  The majority of it was simple...burgers, chicken sandwiches, and salads.  My group got some starters and I loved the bacon wrapped water chestnuts.  I knew they would be better with bacon!  Others got wings, and potato chips with hot sauce drizzled on it.  I got the Bigger Mac, which has the same ingredients of a McDonald's Big Mac, but way better. The burger came with waffle fries...score!    So it was overall a good experience, I just feel like I would eat this food at a sports bar or a pub & grille, not at a futuristic robot chamber.",

    "text": "High design. Low cuisine. And I'm okay with that.  I don't think I've ever seen a fancier spot to get burgers, wings, and fries. And if that's what you're into, I think you can learn from my group's not-so-great experience and have a solid meal.   Burgers. Specifically, their specialty burgers. I had the au poivre burger, because I thought the addition of blue cheese and bacon in the au poivre  II might be gilding the lily. But I think this place is all about gilding the lily, so don't be afraid to go for the gusto.  The waiter was very clear about the kitchen's definitions of rare, medium rare, and medium. I ordered the one with the warm red center, not the pink red center, and certainly not the one that was half pink and half brown.   What's interesting about this place is that they slice the burgers in the kitchen, and despite being able to clearly see the au poivre burger was brown all the way though, someone still decided to send it out to me at the table.   When I made a comment, they were very apologetic, and speedy about bringing me a replacement. Still, I hate sending back food.   Let's focus on the positive.  The Hell's Fire Chips were delicious. I loved that they came with extra hot sauce on the side.   The Water Chestnuts wrapped in Nueske's bacon are fab.  The local beer list has a lot of good choices, and it's fun to try the regional brews when in a new town. Two blonde ales on the menu? Loved that. Blonde ale and burgers is my jam.  I was also a fan of the buffalo-blue cheese dip that came with the fries, and they were kind enough to bring me an additional side of it.  Other learnings?  Stick to beer instead of their oversized martinis. Large martinis get warm,  unless you drink them quickly. And if you drink these quickly, you'll end up on the floor.   The menu says to eat dessert first. Maybe we should have listened. The key lime tart sounded fantastic.  Stay away from the bonfire chicken. It came highly recommended, but it wasn't anything special.  After looking at some of the other pics on Yelp, I kind of regret not ordering the grilled vegetables with jumbo shrimp.  Find a friend who has the same taste in burgers and split one. Then you may have room to share an app and split a dessert. Serving sizes are large.   It actually seems like everything in AZ is large. Except for the people. The people look really fit. It also seems like they spend a lot of time in cars, so I have no idea how they do it. Maybe it's the heat?",

My friend who frequents this place say they change the theme every few months to keep it interesting. I would say at the moment it looks very gay friendly. Especially with \"Don't Ask What?

My date orders a blueberry vodka and lemonade, but the bartender suggest a different drink which was blueberry vodka, lemonade, sour and some other liquor. Get the bill, $14 for this magical concoction. Are you freaking kidding me?! It's 5pm and we're the only people there and you suggest a different drink and charge me $14. Where the hell are we NYC?!

    "text": "This is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix/Scottsdale by far.  I have been dining at AZ88 at least once every couple months since 2001.  The thing that impresses me most is the consistency of the food.  I usually order one of a my usual sandwiches (Picnic Chicken or BLT) and every time it is delicious.  And the waffle fries are probably the best fries I've had anywhere.  They are literally to die for.  Service is always pretty good, invariably some nights when they're busy it can be slower than other nights, but overall I've never once had bad service.  There's a DJ up in the rafters and they rotate an always-interesting art display through the place every few months.  AZ88 has a great vibe and atmosphere.  It feels like it should be in Miami instead of Scottsdale, and the crowd is usually more trendy and upscale than the douchebaggery spotted elsewhere in Scottsdale.  I feel like I'm on a mini-vacation when I'm dining there. I've tried several items from the menu over the years and everything has been excellent. Drinks are the strongest in town by far.  My girl usually gets one of the martinis, which are super strong and HUGE.  I keep it simple with a mixed drink (vodka/sprite or Captain/diet) and they bring a glass full of ice and liquor and a separate small can or mini-bottle of sprite or Coke.   AZ88 will continue to be my go-to restaurant anytime friends are in town or we want to just have a relaxing enjoyable \"night on the town\" that is guaranteed to start off right with a great dinner.",

I will go back and try something else because I didn't have a bad experience and never have.  I recently sat at the bar and had 2 different bartenders.  Both were great and entertaining.

I first noticed the menu is more on the affordable side (I do remember this place to be really expensive in the past]. Second, the  size of the portions are bigger than I remember, so you do not have to order something extra to complement your meal. And last but not least, do not miss the club sandwich.

Went out with two of my boys and after deciding that it was not in the stars to drive out to DTPHX to try out Fez, I yelped some Scottsdale options and settled on AZ 88. After walking in and seating ourselves, we quickly noted a resemblance to Hanny's...a good resemblance. Plenty of (comfy) seating, mood lighting, glass and mirrors, and chill music. We sat ourselves (as noted) by the modern Christmas tree and our server came by shortly with menus.  In terms of service, our server was attentive and showed up when needed and not much more, which we didn't mind since we were in no rush and were enjoying our time there.   We started off with the galletes which, while I am not a fan of olives, I really liked. I feel like flat bread is the new \"thing\", and theirs is pretty good. I had the New Presbyterian to drink and L had the Bellini, both of which were yum. It took us a while to decide on our entrees, but I got the chicken & bacon club sandwich, L had the ahi tuna sandwich, and O. had the hot pepper chicken sandwich, all of which we we really liked. The fries were BOMB and I wish that more had come with my sammy :( I also liked that all sandwiches come with fruit which was also good. The sandwich was goooood, not extraordinary but above average. It was a little dry for my liking so I asked for a side of ranch which made a world of difference.   To finish it all of the three of us shared the strawberry shortcake and the super-chocolate-mousse-cake-thing. The crowd was really chill, it wasn't very packed but it was a Monday night. I can imagine how beautiful the area is in the daytime and the patio is really nice as well. For the price, it's somewhere I'd definitely come again.",

The beautiful people crowd must have still been primping or sleeping, because they were nowhere to be seen.  That's fine.  I find I look much better sitting next to an ugly person anyway.  I went with the portobello mushroom sandwich, with onion, tomato, and crispy fried potatoes.  The tomatoes weren't quite ripe, and the potatoes just tasted like an over-browned potato chip.  Does anyone remember Laura Scudders crappy chips?  Kinda like that.  The waffle fries, however, were fantastic.  Usually, I'm not a fan of the waffle fry as they are usually undercooked or overcooked.  But these were just right.  I had no complaints about service, and the restaurant is nice.

I have been there both for just the bar scene and separately for just the dining experience (It was post 21st birthday and I wan't about to get a martini, although they are superb).  Out to dinner with the family was great. Everyone loved their entrees and we all tried something different.  Getting 4 out of 4 customers at a table pleased is a feat (especially with my family).  Hands down the BURGER AU POIVRE II (with bacon and bleu cheese) is to die for. Don't even need to look at the rest of the menu.  Waffle fries and the assortment of dipping sauces is also a necessary side.    My 'drinking' experience at AZ88 is even better than my already fantastic dining experience.  Order a Manhattan and order it from Kyle.  He made is perfectly and kept filling up my glass with its remants in the shaker as I sipped it.  How great is that?!?! I also asked for an extra cherry (as always) and he gave me a WHOLE CUP OF CHERRIES.  Again, How great is that?!?! And it gets even greater.... so we all took a fancy to Kyle and asked him to create us a cocktail.  Shockingly (I know) it was great and as he listed off its constituents I was estatic to learn that he had included  ST. GERMAIN in his creation.  Ladies and gentleman, St. Germain is my FAVORIE liqueur and is used in but few cocktails.    *Sidenote - AZ88 is a supposed gay bar at night ... however on this particular Saturday it didn't seem at all like BS West and was fairly quiet... great place to actually have a conversation.  This specific Saturday might be the exception to its usual crowd and volume... I'll go back to confirm or disprove this another weekend.  :)",

The Buffalo chicken sandwich and Hell Fire Fries are my personal favorite. The wings are also really good.  The martini's are also great and I have tried many of them. It's not easy to get into this place on weekend evenings or art walk nights. The service is decent. Mostly dependent upon who serves you. I would highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "After reading the rave reviews on Yelp, I was very excited to host my friend's small birthday dinner at AZ 88. Tucked in a back corridor on Scottsdale Mall Rd, our Iphone navigation took us to a parking lot a bit north of the restaurant, so we called to get directions. The host didn't know how to guide us, so she put us on hold and then apparently forgot about us. Meanwhile, we find the place on our own, no big deal, and the host is quick to put a table together for us.   Our server seemed to be in a rush the entire time, even though the place was nearly empty. We ended up placing all of our orders separately because she'd leave before everyone had a chance to order. Very odd.   I ordered a specialty drink not on the menu and it came out wonderfully; everyone was very happy with their drinks. However, I found everything to be way too overpriced. Here we are paying $12 for martinis and we get burgers in a basket with waffle fries. Just doesn't really seem to go together, which is also True for the music and artwork. Everything seems to be overdone, overpriced, yet lacking any sense of cohesion.",

    "text": "AZ88 defies categorization.   Location? Total suck. Tucked away behind an obnoxious parking garage in the middle of *shudder* Old Town Scottsdale. Completely and totally inconvenient for Phoenicians who don't want to drive half an hour home sloshed. I know, I'm such a party pooper. Watching the other sloshed drivers run their SUVs with rooftop cargo carriers into the supporting beams is pretty amusing, though. They were Canadian, eh.  Ambiance? Schizophrenic, much like the patrons. Lots of mirrors and sleek lines, but not IKEA modern... try Miami Vice modern. Seating is generally tight and uncomfortable, and it's loud as hell. The bathrooms certainly are infamous, being all unlabeled with semitransparent doors and shit. The individual stalls are completely lined with mirrors so you can admire yourself doing your business from all angles. However, either I've lost ten pounds without realizing it or those mirrors are slimming and elongating, like those circus ones. I'd like one at home, please.  Patrons? Well, I swear to you that every single time I've gone to AZ88, there has been a bachelorette party, resplendent with plastic tiaras and squealing girls in slutty Forever 21 dresses tipsy on champagne.  Next to them, though, is a couple in their 60s who practically have $100 bills oozing from their pores. Endless examples of plastic surgery, good and bad. Gay boys in tight jeans and spray tans with huge martinis, checking their iPhones. College kids. Cougars. Children. Really. It's like an endless parade of absurdity.   Drinks? Now we're talking. You'd think a place this cheesy would have lame watered down foo foo drinks. Au contraire! The drink menu is pages long and chock full of old favorites. Rusty Nail! Brandy Alexander! Bring! It! On! The beer list is manageable but contains obscure favorites such as Chimay (in practically gallon size bottles).  Food? Vegetarians, rejoice. AZ88 has a delicious roasted vegetable plate that is big enough to provide three more meals. If you're feeling a little lacto-ovo, go for the grilled cheese (minus the bacon), stuffed full with thick slices of tomato. Really, it's just an excuse to get my paws on those scrumptious, much-ballyhooed waffle fries. The burgers look incredible and both my dad and SO (two of the pickiest, whiniest people on the planet) love them. The desserts are amazing too. I swear their hot fudge is laced with a hint of cherry. Killer.  Service? Pretty damn good, given the circumstances. Our server even scared up some BBQ for my fries, even after telling me they didn't have any. Pretty cool.  So really? Good drinks, excellent people watching, and goddamn waffle fries? No contest. Now, if we could just relocate a little closer...",

I got the signature \"AZ 88 Chicken Salad\" and it was... weird. Chicken was good (like a hot chicken wing) sitting in top of a bitter green salad drowning in blue cheese dressing (with mushrooms for some reason). GOOD THING I WAS HUBGRY AFTER WAITING 50 MINUTES FOR A SALAD TO ARRIVE.   The real crime was the glacial service. We counted ANOTHER FULL HOUR BETWEEN ASKING FOR THE BILL AND FINALLY SIGNING THE RECEIPT.   Holy hell. It's as if they have never heard of splitting a check before. Brought out a single bill for 8 people (why would we be paying together?) and after spending 10 minutes interviewing us on what we ordered (shouldn't they know!?) she proceeded to bring back several totally incorrect and screwed up checks. We finally told her \"we'll just pay these as is and figure it out among ourselves!\" because we were so desperate to leave as hour 3 in our seats we're rolling around. IT TOOK FOREVER. EVERYONE WAS YAWNING AND ITCHING TO LEAVE.   No kidding, there were seemingly-eternal 15 minute gaps (where the server was doing God-knowswhat)between every single step in the bill paying process. INSANE. IT TOOK AN HOUR.   Then, to add insult to injury, I luckily noticed the TWENTY PERCENT SERVICE CHARGE added to our checks without any notice, while still adding a \"Tip\" line which I had to tell my friends \"don't tip! They added it already!\". Very dishonest.",

Yes, you have to lap the first few times like a cow drinking from a trough to get the level low enough to pick it up.  But that is expected and acceptable behavior.

The black-out torte is the best death by chocolate ever, the sundaes are really good, and as for alcohol, this if my favorite place to drink mojitos in Scottsdale.   I regret not knowing what their shrimp ceviche is like.. yet.  This was also one of the earliest places in the valley that accommodated gluten free diets, I think this information is worth pointing out for those who eat gluten free.  Random side note, this place is swanky and the art hanging from the ceiling looks like  something Jean Paul Gaultier would have designed.  The bathrooms are a little trippy, neon light, mirrors.  With the mirrors, it's hard mode on heels + mojitos.",

The food is nothing to write home about and therefore a little overpriced IMO, but it is definitely good, and their apps are exactly the greasy stuff you are hungry for when you've had one too many drinks (chicken wings, french fries, etc.).   I choose this place when I want a really good beverage- my drink of choice is the St. Germain. Warning, these are not your typical  \"Scottsdale\" frilly drinks, pretty as they may be- they'll knock you flat if you aren't careful! But I enjoy strong drinks that require you to sip, not gulp like juice. They are pricey, but they are well made of quality ingredients and go a long way.   With regards to the atmosphere, it's pretty chic for Arizona. The ultra modern, all-mirror bathrooms (and the fact that no matter how many times you have been here, you can't find them on the first try) are an endearing quirk to an otherwise very classy space. Very clean (but not stark), not over-designed and they always feature a changing art installation in the middle and sometimes behind the bar as well. I've actually never sat on the patio but the glowing overhang structure is really beautiful and a great first impression.   I can't remember a visit without a great, attentive server. Also, because I was confused before- you seat yourself and a server will find you (and they always do, promptly).   I like any excuse to go here, but I'd especially recommend it when you really want to impress a difficult-to-impress guest, an artsy friend, or a \"just drinks\" date. Cheers!",

    "text": "My husband and I were excited to give AZ88 a try before the show we were seeing at the Scottsdale Performing Arts Center. They don't take reservations so we decided to arrive early to get an outdoor seat. There was none available so we opted for a table close to the window. We were seated about 4:50PM. The show we were going to see started at 7:30PM.  Not sure if they were having an \"off night\" but the service was BEYOND slow. We didn't leave the restaurant until 7:20PM.  When our waiter was at the table, he was very nice but he took forever to get questions answered and forgot to bring us our hot sauce.   We started off by ordering 2 appetizers and a bottle of wine. The appetizers arrived at the table before the wine. Ironically we felt we were going to be rushed because of this. The water chestnuts were great; the shrimp cocktail was nothing to write home about. The fries were also great.   As for cocktails, we both ordered the English Garden and it was terrible! It was supposed to be comprised of St. Germain elder-flower liqueur, Hendricks gin, and fresh cucumber. I tasted absolutely no elder-flower liqueur. It tasted like gin with poorly muddled cucumbers and had a very gritty texture; not worth $30 bucks for the pair. The waiter noticed we hardly touched them; when we said they weren't up to par he apologized, removed the 3/4 full martini glasses from the table, and nothing was done after this.  At around 6:15PM, we placed an order for the Golden Gate Cake, an Espresso Martini and a coffee with a Bailey's kicker. They did not arrive at our table until 7:00PM and they forgot cream and sugar for the coffee. Since our show was starting in just 30 minutes, we were hardly able to enjoy our drinks. My husband was able to flag down someone and ask for cream and sugar for his coffee but by 7:15PM, they still failed to bring it. At this point he had already poured the Bailey's into the coffee but it was still so black and bitter that he wasn't able to drink it. The dessert was described as a butter rum cake but it was super dry and just tasted like pound cake that was a few days too old. The Espresso Martini was redeeming but not quite enough to make us want to come back. We were hoping this would be our permanent before show destination but between the slow service and poor drinks, we will be looking for another place in Old Town.",

These were prepared as stated, the bleu cheese was a little strong for those of us at the table. We ordered entrees, 2 cheeseburgers, 1 hamburger and the AZ88 chicken sandwich. All came with waffle fries and fresh fruit. Everyone enjoyed their food and the atmosphere was superb. This place is really about ambiance. We ordered the Golden Gate Cake for dessert. It was super yummy!!!!!  If in the Phoenix area, give them a shot!",

They top each glass to the brim, and highly-trained wait staff will bring them to you with skill and poise, that it's a show in of itself watching your drink come to you.   One time, a waiter I had accidentally splashed some of my Vesper Martini on the table while trying to set it down. I didn't think anything of it - hell if it were me trying to deliver that thing, I'd probably spill most of it! But he came back not even 3 minutes later with another shot glass full of martini to top me off! Great service. I also love the food - it's like high-end comfort foods that are great to enjoy while you're getting a good buzz going.   Great vibe. Great location. Great drinks. Enjoy!",

They also provide a large and eclectic amount of drinks and in a very interesting but beautiful atmosphere depending on what time of day you go. Day or night, I recommend to visit.",

    "text": "How have I not wrote a review on AZ88 yet? I love this place!   Another reviewer wrote, \"The ambiance screams West Hollywood nightlife but the food screams late night dive bar.\" This is almost spot on! I would say that the ambiance and drinks scream South Beach Miami nightlife and food is your hometown's sports bar. It's unusual but, to me, it works!  The decor changes pretty regularly and is always cool and artistic. I love coming in to see what they have displayed above the bar. And I always visit during the holidays because they create an interesting decorative Christmas tree. One year it was made out of money! This past year it was made of safety pins.  The drink menu is heavy on the cocktails. I'm normally more of a wine and beer sort of gal, but I make an exception when I come here and I usually order a lemon drop. Beware, the drinks are strong!   While the drinks are very fancy, the food is pretty casual. Lots of sandwich and burger options. I love the waffle fries and they have a couple different dipping sauces (blue cheese, remoulade, spicy ketchup). If you are eating healthier, I like the grilled vegetables dish. It's just a bunch of different veggies with a teriyaki sauce. It sounds simple but they mange to make vegetables taste much better than they do when I make them at home.",

The indoor seating is also nice especially when the exterior doors are all wide open making indoor and outdoor blend together.  The food is very good.  Try the bacon wrapped water chestnuts they are so good.  The AZ88 Buffalo Chicken sandwich is the bomb (literally because it's so spicy hot).  The burgers are good.  Drinks are very good, talented bar staff.  I recommended a Greyhound with an upgraded vodka of your choice (unless you like Smirnoff).  Fresh squeezed grapefruit juice is used in the Greyhound.  Beer selection is just ok.  The music is a great mix of lounge music and classic pop.  The artwork inside is always changing and interesting.  The bar used to be mixed crowd on Saturday nights, just keep an open mind and and you will be fine.  Worth a visit to AZ88, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Walking up to AZ88 I wasn't sure if I was visiting a modern art museum or a restaurant. Tall and prominent glass windows and high ceilings give the interior a bright feel while the sculpture garden, visible through them, brings the outdoors in. I thought I was in for a real treat.   An open and modern restaurant like this should surely have a fresh menu, but alas, that was not the case. A page of starters, comprised mostly of dishes based on fries or chips, was followed by burgers, salads, chicken sandwiches and a few entrees, all of which were fairly predictable and common place. If I'm being completely honest, I was actually caught off guard by the menu.   I ended up ordering the Burger Au Poivre II which has Burgundy red onionsauce, blue cheese and thick cut bacon. I liked the note on top of the burger section that mentioned the butcher shop they'd been buying from for years and that helped me decide. Ultimately the burger came out medium, but it was still flavorful and juicy, so I let it slide. The waffle fries were impeccably crispsnf the fresh fruit and veg garnish was a nice touch.  Almost as shocked as when I saw the bartender with the blowout sporting Rayban esque sunnies with yellow lenses behind the bar. That shock was topped by the waitress who was super friendly, but in that weird diner waitress kinda way, with the accent to boot. Again, pleasant, got all the details, took great care of us, but just a bit more brash and congenial than the atmosphere would suggest.   I will say I was impressed they had a cocktail menu with a large wine and beer list. The cocktails were also basic and predictable, but the prices were fair because the spirits chosen were good, not great.   After we'd ordered and eaten I took note of the other diners in the room and it stated to make sense. Most looked like older folks who enjoyed cruising through this area and had been dining here for years. That again helped explained a lot for me.  You won't have a bad meal here. You won't be blown away. Prices are slightly higher due to the area.",

    "text": "Don't know why this place has such good reviews as tonight we had the worst experience here. The only saving grace was the server, she tried but the experience was made and broken by the general manager. We arrived on a Saturday evening where we were sat promptly by a nice manager. However, the place was so hot. Literally, everyone was toweling off the face and body as they were sweating. The poor servers have to wear button down shirts and when asked said the ac wasn't working well tonight. In addition, \"the managers were aware but said this is what it is\". I had my children with me, so I was not impressed with the fact that they didn't advertise that either the ac was broken as the server said. Or the other claim, that according to the manager \"they run the air conditioner at 82-85 degrees due to the ac unit and the windows they have\". That infuriated me after sitting there waiting for the food to come out which was \"meh\". To have him tell us that as an explanation and act like that wasn't an issue for your patrons was unacceptable. This restaurant literally was so loud, we couldn't hear each other practically which was another issue for us. It was 7:30 on a Saturday so fix the ac and turn the music down. This isn't a club. When the servers are sweating through the clothes it's an issue. Also when the \"manager\" tries to quiet you when asked these pointed questions, that's not impressive either. When he said I want to cover your check, I said no I'll pay it as the server did nothing wrong and the food was okay. The fact it was hot the entire meal was the issue. With a manager like this, I hope the owner can figure out how to tighten the reins as this place is not the restaurant that we were advertised by friends in the area. We will not be back and will be sure to share the experience with others as it's not okay to not have ac in Arizona during the summer. I gave them two stars as the server was doing her best and the drink at the bar was a good experience. Can't give them a 3 as it was a sweltering hot box.",

I don't think this restaurant can accommodate large groups even though we had a reservation 3 weeks in advance and came in with a cake the night before and confirmed everything. Our waiter was really tall guy and he seemed short and irritated as soon as we sat down. It took them an hour to seat us even with a reservation. Our dinner lasted 3 hours because the service was unbelievably slow. The food was good is why I'm giving this place two start. I am sad to end the bday tradition here but I will be moving to a restaurant who can accommodate a large group",

This place was dead but it was interesting all the lights were off and the had a bunch of disco balls lit up in center of room. It was cute. However, what I hated was the bench/half table the back of bench has alot of give and you're basically laying down. I had the grilled cheese it was so good and the waffle fries are great. I ordered the spicey ketchup.  It's so good. My husband got a burger he really liked it. The other two people got the tuna. Everyone one seemed to enjoy.",

If you are out with someone you might be bored of, or have some other reason you would rather not speak to your date, this is also a great place for dinner and drinks. If you love people watching, this is a great place. If you would love to pick up a third person... The food is good, the service is good, the atmosphere is good. So what bothers me? I have been going to this place for years and they still do not offer a veggie burger. In truth, the place is not very veggie friendly. I could forgive that if I wasn't informed by the waitress that their grilled veggies are cooked in CHICKEN STOCK. My suggestion? Offer a gardenburger option for your burgers, and please put an asterisk next to your grilled veggies pointing out that they are not a vegetarian option (or make them vegetarian). I'll be back since my family and friends love this joint, but I will ask (nicely) for a veggie burger every time :)",

    "text": "I grew up in Arizona, and this place came of age at about the same time I did.  I remember it being the height of 80s style in the late 80s and early 90s.  They always had steak tartare on the menu and it always went perfectly with a stiff Martini.  But then I graduated from ASU, moved away and forgot about it.  Over the holidays, while visiting family, I thought it would be cool to take a walk down memory lane.  While they've undergone some subtle changes, they still seem completely in the moment.  Our meal went like this:  Apps Galettes: Simple flat bread topped with bacon, carmelized onions, olives and parmagiano.  The menu calls it as it is: Very simple, yet so much more.  Hell's Fire Chips: Homemade potato chips topped with melted gorgonzola & Arizona Gunslinger chili sauce.  I've already ordered some of this sauce online so I can replicate this dish at home accurately.  Think of it as a creative, middle-brow Superbowl party dish.  Main Plates Burgers for everyone!  We were all in the mood for burgers, and AZ 88 has that angle covered.  I had the Au Poive II.  This is an amazing burg!  The patty is covered in peppercorns, grilled, and then basted in a burgandy reduction.  The \"II\" part amounts to a topping of melted gorgonzola and thick applewood smoked bacon.  This is an absolutely amazing assemblage.  My father-in-law had the Au Poive, my mother-in-law a straight-up cheeseburger and my wife had the Las Brisas.  If you're not going to have the Au Poive I or II, go for the Brisas: Jalepenos, jack, avocados and a wee bit of salsa.  Phoenix is one of only a handful of places where these type of burger doesn't seem cheesy, so take advantage of it while you're there!  This place is still a bar at heart, so the drinks were solid.  They carry Chopin, so they get bonus points in my book.  Plus,  it was served cold but not watered down.  This is becoming an increasing rarity, so I was pleasantly surprised.   I hesitated to give them 4 stars, but considering the wonderful meal and the sense of place and history I feel better about it.  Looking for a bit of adolescent nostalgia, or just a slightly edgy burger joint/bar off the beaten path near Old Town Scottsdale?  You can do MUCH worse than to stop off at AZ 88.",

The story behind this fantastic little martini/restaurant bar is that it is owned by Karl Kopps from Milwaukee, WI and it has sister bar in Milwaukee that is called Elsa's. Both have the same vibe and menus. What's interesting is that the artwork rotates from place to place and keeps the vibe changing.   I highly recommend the burger!  Yes, I said BURGER... as in Hamburger!  It's awesome. Therefore, kick back and savor a martini while chilling to good tunes and munching on a hand-packed piece of Americana!   The bottom line: if your looking for a chic little place that always has a a great vibe. Than this is your spot.   PS. Be prepared to wait for a table or come early as they so get packed!!",

It was very flavorful and a bit messy. but that's ok. My boyfriend had the grilled cheese and it was awesome. We both loved the waffle fries (and I really, really love fries) and the fruit and veggies were also good!  My boyfriend ordered a black & tan, which they couldn't make, so he settled for a Guinness.  I ordered the celebration champagne, which was  great! Although the fizz spilled all over the table leaving a sticky mess.  The only real gripe I have with AZ88 is that our IDs were checked 3 times.  Once at the door, again at the table, and a third time with a second form at the manager's request. Kind of annoying (my boyfriend and I are 23).",

    "text": "For those of you who have dined atop the Space Needle in Seattle, I compare AZ 88 to that....the food isn't all that, but the ambiance and atmosphere is so incredibly fun and alluring, I suppose you don't really care and will continue to come back? (hence 1 star added to an otherwise 3 star rating based on food alone)  I've been here a few times, and EVERY single time, I seem to always get a mediocre (nicely presented, though!) dish. This past weekend though, I have to say the hostess went above and beyond for our large 13 person party. We were worried we wouldn't be able to get a table (don't accept reservations), but she said that whenever we were ready, she would figure something out. Only 3 of our party had arrived, and she still seated us (sometimes rare) outside on the patio and brought the females shawls in case it got too chilly (now that truly wow'd me).   Too bad she wasn't our server. He fell a lil short on our scale. When I asked him which specialty martini he suggested (they have no menu) he said they could make anything. I further pried, but he only answered with \"Well, we're a martini bar, anything is good.\" 1st off, if I'm asking you a specific question, it ain't thaaaat hard to give me 1-2 options, at least to just humor me. Whatever :) I figured if they were a True martini bar, they probably had some fun options, which is why I didn't want to order the classic cosmo or flirtini.  The service was super slow all night. I have to blame that on the fact that we were a large party and maybe he thought we wanted time to ourselves to socialize? Still, I think it is best to cater to your tables more efficiently no matter the size.  Ok meal. Ok drink (oh, i got the praised Key Lime martini..so-so). Great music. I'll keep on returnin.",

The atmosphere is always happening and lots of  good looking people just hanging around.  It's definitely chic and unique, but it feels like that's where things go wrong.    The day I went the music was really loud, it was pretty good selection but it was way too loud.  I had a hard time hearing my friends, I felt like az88 was more of a bar pretending to be a restaurant.  The interior decorations had a Liberace on crack feeling (life sized rhinestone studded dogs???).  The drink menu was great and imaginative, I tried a couple of cocktails.  The food was ok, nothing to write home about but nothing to complain either.  Portions was on the smaller side for the price.  They had a chocolate tart that was pretty amazing, the highlight of my evening.  I might go there again just for that.  I think this is a great place to go have a drink and hangout, not much of a restaurant, it's just too much attention on everything else and not enough about the food.",

The ingredients blended together very nicely. My husband ordered a burger with peppercorn, bleu cheese, bacon, and a special sauce. It was also delicious. His only complaint was that it was a bit heavy on the peppercorn.  Portions were huge. I ate just over half a sandwich. Prices were fair. Our meal was under $30, including tax.

The Hot Pepper Chicken sandwich is the best, IMHO, although I've also tried the salads and some of the other chicken sandwiches.  Gotta love the waffle fries.  The pickle, raw veggies, and fresh fruits also in the basket really do round out the meal.  It's disappointing that there's not much on the dessert menu for the raging chocoholic in me, but the Golden Gate Cake was admittedly not bad, as non-chocolate desserts go.   Expect to pay the same amount for your entree and your drink -- it all evens out.  The girly martinis are delicious.  I'm also a huge fan of the Pimm's cup.   As far as the crowd/scene, I really wouldn't worry about it too much - the waitstaff is always very welcoming and everyone is just there to have a good time.",

Nice patio.  If you don't mind a staff with attitude, then you'll love this place. (ahem... welcome to Snottsdale.) Questions like \"Temperature?\" when ordering a burger as opposed to \"How would you like that done?\" leave the guest translating waiter's meanings. Personally I appreciate waiters who are there to ensure you are comfortable and pleased with the dining experience. After working 10+ years in the hotel business I know what I am talking about.  Oh and even locating the restrooms proves to have attitude. Guests must pay attention to the gender identifiers which are way at the bottom of the door softly illuminated. And inside the mirrors were at every angle and odd lighting showing far more than I need to see. Gheeezzz!  There are so many other choices where I can spend my money... I think I will chose a friendlier place next time.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhomepage.mac.com%2Faz88%2FSite%2FHome.html&s=e05c2a152f34701d19fcce510147218ef56ffb65628acde8678aa68d5dd2c92f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">homepage.mac.com/az88/Si...</a>",

Wallpaper above the bar of what are presumably the names of cabbies and their hack license numbers.  I was disappointed in my anticipated dissatisfaction.  The food was good! The service very polite (if a bit less than prompt) and the prices reasonable.  We started out with some shrimp cocktail (standard, they didn't mess it up) and an appetizer called Hell's Fire Chips. Home made potato chips smothered in crumbled blue cheese and drizzled with hot sauce - awesome!  The mini bottled Coke is tasty, but at $2.25 for 8 ounces a bit pricey.  The music was eclectic and present but not so loud as to drown out conversation.  For mains - an Alfredo burger and an All-American grilled cheese. Both came with waffle fries, a pickle, and assorted garnish. Both were tasty, but not awesome.  Desert - Black-Out Torte (chocolate mousse on a chocolate torte). Very tasty, rich - but not decadent. Served with a bit of whipped cream and strawberry drizzle.  Overall not bad. Not too overpriced for a downtown Scottsdale eatery. Steps from the Scottsdale Center for Performing Arts, worth stopping by before or after a show. (They stay open late)",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place. The unfortunate truth is no matter how good the food is or how amazing the drinks are, if the service sucks the experience is bad. When we arrived they were pretty busy, it was a Friday night around 8:30. I could see open tables all over so I was relieved. We stood at the door next to the please wait to be seated sign for almost 15 minutes before being greeted from across the room by someone a waiter finally flagged. We were seated and greeted quickly by a friendly lady that gave us menus and left to get us water. We started to read the menu when another waitress came over and also asked for a drink order. We told her someone was already taking care of us and she said \"I will be your server, let me go talk to her because I know exactly who it was!\" We were just kind of agreeable. Well about another 10 min. Pass and server number 2 comes walking over with our water. We ordered a coconut martini and a mule. We also placed an order for the chicken dish and some wings. I don't know how long we waited for those drinks but we sat there talking and finished an entire glass of water and half of a refill (courtesy of the waiter for the table next to ours) when they arrived and our food was delivered by someone else moments later. The food was pretty good but the order was wrong and since our waitress never came back to check and didn't bring it out herself, we never got it fixed. After we finished eating my other half ordered another drink. I was hoping we could just go somewhere else and not wait 20 minutes for a $15 drink but it was too late lol. She had brought the tab when he ordered it so something told me we would never see her again. We could see his drink sitting on the bar....waiting. Not kidding, 20 minutes later she brought it over. The entire meal would have been different if we could have just kept our first waitress. I don't mind spending money on a great meal and some drinks but I refuse to pay for awful service. We won't be back.",

The highlight, of course, is the menu.  They offer a great selection of burgers, sandwiches and salads.  They really know how to make a great salad too (I'm convinced this is an art that is rarely mastered).  I highly recommend the shrimp salad with the citrus dressing.  It's divine.  I have not been disappointed with anything I've ordered, though.  I'm already looking forward to my next visit.",

Lets start with the Aviation martini - made with Noblets Gin, Luxardo and Creme de Violet - shaken, straight up - it is by FAR the most amazing cocktail I have ever feasted on!  The bartenders and staff are always warm, friendly and make perfect martinis.  They always manage to fill it all the way to the rim, without wasting a drop! How they always do that in every drink, is beyond me.  I don't see them measure, which will ruin a drink anyway.  Drink making is an art, that must be felt.  They nail drinks here.  Food - amazing.  From simple chips to salads to the amazing chicken sandwich I ate, I can't find one bad thing to say about them   The decor in the lovely place is stark and white and very contemporary. Perfect for the artsy district they reside in. Keep up the great job!",

    "text": "I've been to AZ88 twice, now.  Once, shortly after moving to Phoenix, five years ago.  Once, last week.   The first time, we stopped in for a late lunch w/ another couple.  The place was almost vacant, which afforded us a nice atmosphere for conversation.  I sort of dug the sterile modern decor and the food was okay (I don't remember much about it, but had the bacon/avocado incarnation of the 7353 Club).  Sure, a DJ was playing 6-year-old electropop, but the bill wasn't too devastating and I'd liked that 6-year-old electropop the first time 'round.  The second time, we decided to brave the evening crowd, which was a little snootier and a whole lot larger.  Party of eight was seated w/o a wait, which was nice.  But, we were seated at two tiny round tables they'd pushed together which didn't really afford us the space or intimacy we really needed.    Very much entertained by the scores of people that tripped on a step while coming or going.  Less impressed by the food.    Water chestnuts (wrapped in bacon) were great, but nobody really loved anything else.  Ordered the grilled cheese, which the menu touted as \"truly the best grilled cheese you'll ever have.\"  Should have sent back what came out:  a somewhat squishy cheese goof up, topped w/ the same bacon (?) that earlier had brought meaning and purpose to those water chestnuts, this time a touch undercooked.  Parts of the sandwich were actually wet, presumably from the juice of some unsqueezed tomatoes.  By that time I'd had a few too many beers to care, much.  Bloody Mary was definitely bland.  Most bizarre point of the evening came when the waiter, possibly confused by the cork, tried to serve my single serving Lindemans Lambic Framboise like it was a fine wine, showing off the label and waiting for me to taste before he continued pouring.  I mean, really?  No longer sports the Fletcher Knebel quote (\"Smoking is one of the leading causes of statistics.\") above the bar, which was quite possibly the most interesting thing about the place, if you don't count the artistically lit bathrooms.",

On a Sunday afternoon, the glass walls overlooking the Scottsdale Civic Center Park can almost bring tears of joy to my eyes, it's that gorgeous.  The overall concept is spectacular (OMG! The bathrooms are art installations!).  And the drinks are extraordinarily well conceived and delicious.  Waiters are magnificent, and magnificent to look at.  But boy do they need to rework their kitchen.  I've been here four times, and the food, while generous, just isn't that great.  It's heavy, over sauced and seasoned, and just not that much variety.  Rethink the menu and manage the quality of the kitchen product, and this place is perfect.  As is, just go for a great night of style, terrific cocktails and hanging out.",

The ambiance is very hip and chic.  It feels more like an LA bar than a Scottsdale bar.  The drinks are my favorite thing about AZ 88.

    "text": "Almost seems like a mindless waste of time to review a restaurant with 170+ reviews at time of posting, but since AZ 88 had been on my to do list for such a long time, I feel compelled to waste 20 minutes on this Saturday afternoon.  AZ 88 was not entirely what I'd expected; in some ways this was good, in others not so much, but there are a few scenarios where I'd feel inclined to run back as fast as I can. Unfortunately, they are doing a few things here that I just can't jive with, and I'm not entirely sure why they are doing them. My visit was early on a Wednesday night, no sign of the \"gay bar vibe\" that I'd been told about, instead it was an eclectic mix of tourists, large groups of friends, gay couples, older more sophisticated looking types, etc. It was nice to be in an old town restaurant that was both bar centered and drew a more sophisticated clientele. I'm also glad it wasn't a gay bar, like many had \"warned\" me that it would be.   Bar service here was attentive and helpful, but the one bartender they had on was far too busy to answer any questions I had about the menu or drinks, which was unfortunate, because he seemed like he would be happy to help if not for being so overwhelmed with work by himself. While I waited THIRTY minutes for my Au Proive II Burger, I overheard the couple next to me talking about their past sex lives... not something I cared to listen to, and while not the restaurant's fault, it made the exhorbant wait for my burger even longer. I could have stomached the wait a little better if this place had even one television. I wasn't into the thumping house music and virtually no visual stimulation.   The burger itself here was very well prepared, extremely tasty, and served with a nice array of fruit, veggies, and waffle fries. It had a great Burgundy sauce, bleu cheese, and bacon. The burger itself was peppercorn crusted and delicious.   The bottom line: AZ 88 serves up some pretty good food, and provides a fun atmosphere that I feel is best for large, loud groups. Solo diners need not apply. Prices here are out of control. One burger with no drinks and a 15% tip = $16.50",

Drinks at the Bar - Great choice if you want a quick Margarita in the afternoon.  Drinks are made well with top shelf ingredients.  Dining at the Restaurant.  Food is actually pretty good (once it arrives).  The service is the real curve ball.  Took three different servers to get a coke and a sandwich, it's like they are trying to work as a team, but it just doesn't happen.  Our waiter was nice just not very good and awkward.  You get the feeling the staff was hired to appeal to a certain demographic, and beyond that they are kind of useless.  The Bathrooms - ummmm yeah, for a club in Miami circa 2002 maybe, for a place that doubles as a restaurant in 2011, no go guys, comes off really weird and tacky.  Mirrors, think mirrors !!  One reviewer mentioned the vibe is ultra chic, where you get the feeling they are too cool to just relax and serve good food, and I definitely felt that.

We finally found it after calling to make sure we weren't lost, and there is a really cool outdoor area in front as you walk in. If it was warmer we probably would have eaten outside, but it was a bit chilly, so we opted to eat inside.  We started at the bar for drinks and an appetizer. The drinks were all really good, well crafted and tasty. My Manhattan was just right, and the other people in my party enjoyed their drinks as well. We shared a two appetizers, the dipping fries and bacon wrapped water chestnuts. Both were delicious, though in fairness, you can wrap anything in bacon and it will be amazing.  After some time at the bar, we moved to a table and had dinner. I ordered a peppercorn crusted burger with waffle fries. It sounds great, and it was. \"Mmmmmmm! That IS a tasty burger!\" Two others ordered the same burger (high marks all around), and one ordered a giant salad that looked really good.  Overall the service was good, the drinks were good and the good was good. A successful meal. Ambiance was also nice, and the bathrooms are straight out of a Vegas night club...Very posh.

AZ88 Buffalo CK Sandwich -- I'll eat one or two buffalo CK wing, but to make it a sandwich, I can't recommend.  Too much sauce! Also, make sure you chew fast because after a while the buns begin to go soggy - umm mushy bread with CK cover in buffalo sauce.... (Toast the CK it'll dry some of sauce and give a crispier texture)  Service was off too!  I had 1 beer and 2 waters -- that's all.  If you know me I like a few bottles and at least a jug of water with my meal :) - I know I can't get enough H2O!  I understand the place is popping, but after being seated, there was almost no direction for the wait staff.  Ambience is always cool and love the layout and the feel of the place.  Better luck next time! - Enjoy!",

    "text": "They offer celebration champagne. Ya know.. with the colored sugar crystals. Kinda like Rainbow Brite's star sprinkles. But for grownups. The girlie girl in me squealed like a little piglet in delight :)  While I've had one meh dish here, I've had far more awesome ones. I'm sure I don't have to mention that this is indeed one of the best buffalo chicken sandwiches I've ever had, and the same is probably True for most. It's messy. It's spicy. It's hot. It's goodness. The perfect amount of flavor and kick and enough to make you just full enough.   Oh? You need more proof? The waffle fries are out of this world. Waffle fries are one of my favorites in the fry family and the ones at AZ88 do not disappoint. Not too undercooked. Not burnt. Just right. They'll also help take the edge off the sandwich for those of you that could use that.  I've also really enjoyed the picnic chicken sandwich, which is enough to feet multiple people for a picnic. The sandwich is light and summery and there's lots of yummy fruit on the side. I feel like I should be in one of those hidden valley ranch commercials out on the rolling hills with the trees when I'm eating it.  The service is pretty average but nothing extraordinary. The place is swanky though and the bar is fully stocked. With reasonable prices, great food and swanky decor, this is an all around win if you are looking to impress.. others or just yourself!!",

    "text": "I'm torn by AZ 88.  On the one hand they have a great and inventive menu and a broad selection of liquors, but on the other hand I am unimpressed by some of their cocktails.  Their martinis are HUGE.  I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.  Yeah, everyone loves a generous drink, but on the other hand, when you're drunk after two cocktails, it's a bit much.  Plus, their martinis, despite being big and highly intoxicating, are a watered down.  The martini I ordered was shaken, not stirred.  There's a reason Bond was wrong: shaking melts too much ice and waters down the martini - shaking works with some drinks, but not a martini.  Yes, I was feeling quite the buzz from my massive cocktail, but considering it was served to me in the volumetric equivalent of a fish bowl, that's not surprising.  However, despite watery martinis that compensate for lack of flavor by sheer volume, I must give credit where it's due: the bar is VERY well stocked with high-quality, exotic ingredients.  They even age whiskey in their own barrels.  In sum: a good bar that needs direction from the discerning drinker.  They have all of the building blocks for the best cocktails in the valley, but you'll need to direct the barkeep quite a bit to make sure you get something to live up to the potential.",

You have to have very specific directions to find it as it's got a parking structure in the way and their signage is the antithesis of itself.  That said, once found, it's a stylish, open, bistro style restaurant/bar with clean and clever design.  It was slow, as we went on a Monday but I'd assume this place gets very busy.  Good, friendly service, an interesting and appealing menu and great tasting food.  Nothing super complicated, but well integrated flavors and not overly priced.  A great value and good fresh ingredients.  We had a blast and were so happy about being referred to it.  I'd recommend to anyone!  I wish we had it in Vegas!",

It's huge and topped grilled chicken marinated in buffalo sauce and accompanied with veggies (including avocados) and a bed of lettuce.

    "text": "Let's state the facts: AZ 88 has seemed really cool for some years now, but when my freshman roommate and I first discovered it we weren't old enough to get in past 7pm (it's a lounge at dark, and they card).  Having forgotten about AZ 88 for a few years, I suddenly remembered it this Thanksgiving when my friend Jessica and I were both in our hometown (Mesa, AZ) and were going to get together to catch up.  AZ 88 is not in Mesa (anyone from Arizona would find that assumption laughable) but it is in Scottsdale, which is only a short drive from our parent's East Mesa abodes.  We parked in a lot in Old Town and walked the short distance (though kind of tucked away) to AZ 88.  The bouncer at the door looked...classy...I think that's the best way to describe it.  Dressed in all black, including gloves and a coat.  He took our IDs and granted us entrance.      It was full of people, but not crowded a Christmas-Tree shaped structure which once you get close you realize is completely covered in one dollar bills was the centerpiece of the room.  There is also outdoor seating, but there was a light rain the night we went, so it was not open.  A man who opened the door for us (seemingly a manager just on his way in) asked if we'd like a table and swiftly led us right to one; a perfect little semi-circle booth up against the 'tree' with another semi-plush chair pulled up.  The girls (Jess and I) slid into the booth and Ben, who was also with us, took the chair.  We ordered drinks and since Ben and I had eaten neither lunch nor dinner (big mistake of a busy day) we also ordered the Hell's Fire Chips and  Dipping Fries (main picture).  The food was good, I only didn't like the Hell's Fire Chips as much because I'm not a huge fan of bleu cheese.  The drinks were strong and good.  The dining area was filled with people  of all ages (well, all ages over 21).  There also seemed to be a large presence of seemingly foreign born people speaking in accents and other languages (which is always nice when you've spent your weekend in vanilla Mesa).  The bathroom is intense.  First of all, we had trouble finding it...and almost found ourselves in the kitchen, until a server directed us in the right direction.  At first glance, you can't tell that the large panels are doors--only marked at the bottom with a pink block of color and reading \"SHE.\"  The bathrooms are all mirrors and at the bottom of the sink area there is a small cutout so that a portion of the dining room can see the legs of whoever is washing her hands.  It was very interesting, and kind of funny.  The whole place sparks with groups and fun conversation.  I will definitely go back to AZ 88 when I'm in the mood for a nice dining and drinking experience in an atmosphere that is a little more electric than most.  My only concern is they had a card tucked into the menu that had a Ronald Reagan quote...a particularly bourgeois one too--about money buying memories--disturbing.",

I am reminded of this fact each and every time I stroll in to AZ 88:)  There are, indeed, tons of pretty people at AZ 88...lounging, laughing, lingering, loitering, lolling, loving and probably even lusting:)  For 20 years (although I've only been here for about 5 of those years) AZ 88 has been one of the \"see and be seen\" places in Scottsdale.  And it shows in the clientele...but they let me in anyway:)  It's been a good spot for the Beautiful Carin and I to grab a pre-function cocktail, a relatively cheap burger or sandwich (and a giant martini) or a post-function nightcap.  Besides the fact the fact that it's right in my neighborhood, there are several reasons that Carin and I have become fond of this place over the years:)  * The food really is pretty good...the burgers, sandwiches, salads and appetizers are generously sized and the waffle fries hit the sweet spot in the crusty/greasy axis of arterial obstruction (I was going to attach the graph I created but Yelp doesn't play that way:)  * The food really is pretty inexpensive...I was going to say cheap, but really...it's not cheap, cheap...just inexpensive compared to some of the other places around the neighborhood :)  * The drinks are better than pretty good:) I was thinking that they are expensive, but then I looked at the size of these things and the price to buzz ratio becomes a terrific value (again, I was going to attach a very compelling chart that I've created, but no attachment feature for  spreadsheets and charts! :-)  * The atmosphere is relaxed and relaxing, but fun and upbeat...does that make sense? It does to me after a couple of AZ 88 Ketel One martini's:) Two of those big ass marti's are like a six pack of marti's from Dick's Hideaway...for a lot less dough:) I'm glad I can walk here and back home:)  * There is always something \"happening\" at AZ 88...at Christmas, the martini glass Christmas Tree...witticisms' painted on the walls, power couples attempting to couple in the unisex loo, music and laughter...what more could you want?:)  * Which brings me to the final bullet point of my AZ 88 presentation...the people watching...AZ 88 is like the headwaters of the mighty Columbia River...except that here we have Scottsdale's beautiful people and there we have Chinook salmon...but, respectively, these places are where they go to spawn:) AZ 88 might not be such a blatant meet up spot as someplace like Cream, Dirty Pretty or the W, but for easy conversation, strong drinks and reasonable food, AZ 88 still pretty much leads the pack (again, I put together a trending bar chart that clearly illustrates my point, but I couldn't attach it...oh well if you want the charts and spreadsheets, let me know and I can email them to you:)  Pick a nice evening, wander through the park and end up on the deck at AZ 88...that's what we do every couple of months.  Enjoy watching people strolling through the park, the cocktails, a chicken sandwich and waffle fries and watch all the mating rituals going on around you...some people might call this decadent and dissolute, but I call it \"Thursday Evening\":)",

The crowd has seemed to be quite varied in my experience. But this is OTS, and the usual rules apply.   The current setup of art includes huge pseudo-abstract figures in Kama-Sutra-like sexual positions on the gigantic windows. One per window! It's sort of like a tutorial. I would imagine many a over-the-shoulder-sweater wearing aging socialite has gasped at the \"inappropriateness\" of this. Good. Gasp away, Maude. Props to AZ 88 for being dirty/classy.   The food is not cheap, but not expensive either. It's completely accessible, even casual, which might be different than what some people would expect. But I totally get it. I mean, what's wrong with looking good and having a grilled cheese?  Personally, I would recommend AZ 88 as a place to get cocktails. The prices here are no more or less than any other equivalent restaurants/bars in the area and they do great martinis. The wine list isn't anything crazy, but they do offer a somewhat hard to find but inexpensive Spanish red called Carchelo that is awesome.   Highlight: Come here for drinks and to hang before going dancing to one of the more rowdier (or raunchier?) clubs in the area.",

No one was on the patio (does anyone else think it looks eerily like a cross b/w a Star Wars bar and a Flintstones cafeteria?) due to the rare rain, and the place was packed but I managed to get Melinda a seat at the bar. They had this gigantic drink menu and I was treated to an old lady drink-I think I got a gimlet. Hey-I can't do G&T ALL the time (just 98.8% of the time). It was pricey, but why didn't anyone tell me to bring my swimsuit? Cause I could have SWAM in that glass. Check it-that martini glass was as big as my FACE. It was terrifying to balance and I...of course, did end up spilling 20% on my jacket and outfit (clear drinks rule for that purpose) and smelling of eau de alkie. Glad I didn't drive! But then Melinda ended up spilling her drink on the nice ladies slick black jacket that I discretly dried off with cocktail napkins-hey, it was like vinyl, ok? Don't judge!  Glancing around-there are some GAY hotties here. I mean, damn, can I be a gay man just so I can have an iota of a chance of hitting that? All the beautiful people were here-very LA, but not super Snottsdale either. Diverse crowd, well dressed, artsy, big groups of totally random people sitting together, nibbling at the food like doe on a field, grazers really. I started staring at one table in front of us that had the largest bowl of waffle fries. They were hardly eating them. My god. The longer I was there, the more I WANTED THEM. I started thinking \"Ok-there is a chick-ooo-shes gone-its a bunch of dudes-most of them straight..ok, they will TOTALLY give me a waffle fries..ok, will this make me look coked-up or homeless? Shit. I want one. I'm gonna do it. Fuck it. Ohhhh...shes back. Girls never give food out to random girls. Oh well. Maybe if they leave...and I can grab it before the waiter does...while EVERYONE in the restaurant can see I just grabbed trash off the table in a chi-chi hipster spot...its worth it\".  I didn't. I chickened out. But seeing Kristin's review, I wasn't the only one who feels like a Sex and hte City Oliver Twist. \"Please, sire, one cosmo or waffle frie?\"  We thought about getting another drink there but remembered we had paid 15 bucks for a ticket for a reason (art..oh yeah...) Before heading out, we ended up chatting with our bar's neighbors (the one whose coat we soiled a wee bit).  Her and her new roommate received all this food, one that had like pizza with avocado slices and other delicious thing-my eyes were bugging OUT of my head-this food looks AMAZING. At one point I thought she was going to feed me aforementioned slice-and I wouldn't have cared. She noticed my lobster bling and freaked. I looked down, already a lil sloshed (these drinks are STRONG) and thought she was looking at my chest. \"Huh? They're real\", I thought, not very impressive in the Scottsdale world of implants. She corrected me it was the bling, and I said, \"Oh good....my breasts aren't very impressive and I was wondering why you were checking them out.\" \"Honey-you have FABULOUS tits. You have FRENCH TITS honey, and they are SEXY. WORK THEM.\"  All right.  Once again. \"Az 88?\" \"French Tits\"  ADDENDUM:  Had an actual meal here-get here before 8pm on Friday to avoid more than a 20 minute wait for a table, btw. I had the shrimp cerviche, which was an amazing deal at 9 bucks for a meal instead of an appetizer. Primo avocado, delish shrimp with the fresher salsa and delectible chips, I didn't offer it to share with my fellow dining companions. Since they had the BLT with avocado and bacon and the infamous waffle fries, I asked him to add a small plate with a side of mayo for me to devour with them. And man, they are GOOD-the guys ate their fries before their sandwich! And they only charged me a buck extra for the huge plate of waffle fries I couldn't even finish. Extra star!",

    "text": "I dined here with a friend of mine this week, and I must say I'm a big 'ol fan of AZ 88; this place has a very cool, chic ambiance that I wasn't expecting. The decor, too, was very intriguing (and I think changes occasionally?) - there was a deconstructed taxi cab suspended from the ceiling (which surprisingly I didn't notice until I had sat down and was surveying the restaurant - it's not as overhwhelming a piece of art as you might assume), and the wall behind the bar is entirely populated with license plate numbers of NY cabs, which was unusual but like I said - intriguing.   It's a seat-yourself kind of place, and the service wasn't terrible - our waiter was oddly expressive the entire time - almost like he was acting. It was bizarre. But whatever; no complaints otherwise.   I ordered the Key Lime Martini for starters (on my never-ending quest to find a Key Lime [Pie] Martini to beat the one at Magnolia in L.A.), and it was delicious...because it was missing the \"pie\" part of the martini that I love, it didn't top the charts, but it had great flavor and wasn't overpoweringly alcoholic.  My friend and I went with the dipping fries as our appetizer, which were waffle fries (WAFFLE FRIES!!) with three dipping sauces (hence the name): a remoulade, a spicy chili ketchup and a Buffalo bleu cheese. All of them were great, but my fav was definitely the spicy chili ketchup...I'm a True ketchup lover, so this spin on an old favorite was something I could appreciate. The waffle fries were - sorry to say - NOT as good as Chick-Fil-A's (oh come on...you know they're good), but my friend and I enjoyed them nonetheless.  For my entree, I ordered the Burger Au Poivre, mostly because I'm obsessed with peppercorns. This thing was covered with peppercorns and sauteed in a burgundy sauce with minced red onion...OMG YUM. I added to this a bit of that spicy chili ketchup and was seriously in burger heaven. It was so juicy and warm...I'm salivating just thinking about it. Another yelper talked about a drippy sandwich that they had here, and based on my experience, it seems like drippy sandwiches are basically AZ 88's thing. And ya know what, it works for them, it really does.  This is one place I'd definitely go back...I feel like there's just so much I still want to try! And best of all, AZ 88 won't break the bank.",

    "text": "I used to frequent AZ 88 when I used to live in the Scottsdale. I loved it for its setting--somewhat hidden, somewhat quiet, trendy enough but not too much that it suffocates. I enjoyed their food because of its simple decadence--sandwiches with no-frills sauces, grilled vegetables with a tangy sauce that doesn't over power, and their waffle fries that make you curse Atkins until his dead (oh, wait, he IS dead). Best of all, I enjoyed their drinks. Always refreshing, always exciting, and always seem to creep up to you when least expected giving you a pleasant buzz that makes  everyone around you appear like they're on high definition.  So, really the 2 measly stars are not for the food, ambiance, or drinks. They're for SLADE.  It's been a couple of years (or more) since we visited AZ 88. I thought of going there for dinner last weekend to celebrate Fathers Day. Afterall, it used to be one of my husband's favorite eating joints. So  I invited my parents, my kids and of course my husband, to have a quiet enjoyable dinner over there.  We immediately found a table for 6--a good sign. Everything was going great until SLADE came along. Slade was our slick, \"I-really-ought-to-be-in-LA-acting\" waiter. The minute he saw our group, he immediately put on his scowl face and his \"why-do-I-end-up-with-these-people\" attitude. Was it the kids? Or was it the rare Asian people who made up our group?  (And just a note: my kids grew up eating in restaurants--from SeaSaw to In and Out, and yes they've eaten at AZ 88 before. They've done it all because I don't cook. They even order mom's drinks...for her, of course. And yes, my parents speak English...like the kind you can understand!)  Two seconds after settling to our table, he asks what we would like to drink. I have never felt pressured in my life to think of an alcoholic concoction. Five seconds had passed, and Slade was already sending off telepathic messages to me, saying \"hurry up, bitch, you're wasting my time.\" So I finally blurted out, \"Could you please give us a couple of minutes to think. We'd like to see a drink menu, if we could.\" He grabbed a drink menu, plopped it on the table, and quickly pivoted and sashayed away from our table without saying a word.  I don't know about you, but I thought that was rude.   When we finally decided on our drink orders, Slade's OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) became apparent. He couldn't care less if we had enough ketchup, or if we needed more tangy sauce for the vegetables, or if we needed any kind of condiment to compliment our respective meals.  All he cared about was making sure that each of our drinks was set on a napkin.   He watched each of us like a hawk, making sure that, as we set our glass down, it was placed on a napkin! One time, my son unknowingly set his water glass on HALF the napkin, and Slade was right there to set things right for him, accompanied with an annoyed sigh, of course. Never once did he ask if we needed anything else...he just wanted to make sure that our glasses were on napkins!  Thank god for the food, and the drinks. Those did not fail us. My husband enjoyed that part. But SLADE, and his OCD, oh and his over-gelled hair...that's gotta go!   Thus 2 stars.",

    "text": "1 of 5 and 1 of 1. .....Part 1 of 2  Welcome my 'Duo' review. Two bars, one of the best and one of the worst in the valley. A great example of opposites.  I hope you enjoy reading both!  Welcome to AZ 88. This is the perfect example of a successful bar. The name is simple, it was opened in 1988 by Kopp; a name synonymous with frozen custard, ask anyone in Wisconsin! The owners also own a bar in New York, Bar 89, and Elsa's in Milwaukee.  I have been to Bar 89 in New York when I lived there, and I've gotta say, very much like AZ 88.   Now some of you out there are a bit skeptical because of AZ 88 rep. Let me put you at ease, AZ 88 is not a gay bar, well not entirely. Yeah there are a few from the gay community but at the same time there are performing art fans on nights when there's an event. So it's as much as a performing arts bar, straight bar as it is a gay bar. Think of it this way, I find it a great place to bring a date (especially a first date) for a late dinner and drinks. Hey guys think of it this way, your date may not get hit on as much here as most bars and your date will rave about her Cosmo!   The eats here are some of the best you'll find in a bar. The Hell's Fire chips are house made potato chips, fried to order and basted with hot sauce and blue cheese. Too good not to order, a must, just don't order with a martini, it won't work with a heavy gin or vodka drink. If you must drink hard, have a Cosmo with the Hell's. The Alfredo burger is a winner too, a burger basted with creamy Alfredo sauce. Also, try the spicy, grilled chicken sandwich with jalapenos and honey. This may seem bizarre to you but it works, when you bite into the sandwich its sweet at first then finishes spicy, great flavor. Everything I've tried here is a home run. From apps to sandwiches, fruit plate to burgers, I've never been let down, kudos to the kitchen staff.  As for the drinks, you may not find any better in town. Order a Jack and Coke and you'll get a rock glass with Jack served with a small, retro, glass bottle of Coke. Sit at the bar and order a martini and watch as the bartender shakes ever drop out into your glass as the martini itself convexes over the top of your glass making you first sip a 'lean over'.  The bar is well stocked, with just about every liquor you'd expect. I judge the best bars by 1st the vodka selection, then bourbon, tequila and lastly rum. It's unfortunate people don't order more rum, especially here, they have Appleton Estate Black Label, a scotch drinkers rum, try it on the rocks; it'll change your life. The beer selection is great too, as with wine by the glass. No matter who you're with, the size of your party, everyone is sure to find a drink to their liking.   The places design and decor is unrivaled in the valley because of one simple truth, its ever changing. The artwork changes constantly. Go around Christmas and see the most radical Christmas tree ever. Hey, I'm Jewish and I go every year to see their tree! One year it was hundreds of silver painted mannequin head circulating. Another year the tree was upside down, hung from the ceiling. Another it was Barbie dolls in different color liquids in bottles in the shape of a tree, too many to count, just extraordinary. The art behind the bar changes too, from unique artwork to unique mirrors and shapes. Every time I go the place has changed, I look forward to going sometimes just to see what has changed.  As with every review I always take the restrooms into account, think of it this way, if the public areas are unclean or not kept in a acceptable physical condition it begs the question, what do the areas the guest can't see look like, say the back of the house, specifically the kitchen. AZ 88's restrooms are always clean as a whistle. They are also some of the most unique I've seen. When going to restroom the wall is the door and only marked at the bottom of the door. The hand washing sinks have a window below, seeing through into the dining room. When you go, check them out, super cool.   Seating is comfortable. The tables are just the right distance not to intrude upon each other. The long black couches recline, so if they are available, request them, after a few drinks you'll be thanking me. There is outdoor seating as well, though the tables do seem a bit closer together.  AZ 88 takes music seriously here, or rather the 'audio architecture' as I like to call it. There is a DJ booth above with an experienced DJ spinning everything from acid jazz to 80s, rock to blues, and it all works. Its nice to see (or rather hear) that the owners understand that good background music stimulates conversation and adds to the experience. The volume is always at the perfect level, to listen or have a conversation without screaming.   Since AZ 88 opened many other bars have opened in Scottsdale, no matter how many bars open around it, AZ 88 will always be a prime place for a late night bite, a drink or just a night out people watchin",

Watch it on the martinis, they are bigger than they look (no hate yelps, please ... I wasn't drinking while prego, I just go there often) and properly strong.  AZ88 is my favorite bar to visit around the winter holidays for the festive atmosphere, although I wasn't a fan of the money tree this year ... bring back the martini glass tree! More sparkles.",

I ask if there are black olives on the salad, my server tells me, \"not if you don't want there to be.\"  Damn straight, I like this place.  Clean, very stark and modern decor, but fun.  The \"she-room\" with so many mirrors it makes your head spin?  A total trip, and completely unexpected when you're average lunching age is 65.  (Guess this is what happen when you eat lunch when the seniors are eating dinner.)  Let's just say, I did NOT need to see myself using the rest room from all those angles.  I'm slightly creeped out.  Service is friendly and laid back, but attentive.  I had plenty of water (which seemed to be the key to my entire trip in Phoenix).  A great patio, good for people-watching in the mall area.  And did I mention the salad?  Huge, but this midwestern girl could put it away...big strips of grilled chicken and diced celery tossed in some perfectly spicy buffalo sauce, a side of blue cheese crumbles and some fantastic blue cheese dressing over a bed of seriously delightful greens (no ice berg here, thank you very much.) and bell peppers.  Oh, and the black olives?  They stayed M.I.A. (thank GOD!)  I'd be back if in the area again.",

So you really get your money's worth.   Reservations are not accepted, so the wait can be annoying, but it's quickly forgotten as it's a prime spot for people watching while you hang out at the bar.

A very generous portion of broccoli, carrots, pea pods, cauliflower, purple onions, beans and mushrooms.  Being an occasional vegetarian the grilled veggies are superior to steamed and other forms of preparation.

YES  For those who were aware of the erotic art on the inside near the window (John, is that what I think it is?, Yes, Martha, that is what you think it is.

    "text": "What the hell is wrong with me? I seem to be stuck in Scottsdale!  After my friends and I took in a Tito Puente Jr concert at the ampitheatre for the Scottsdale Center for Performing Arts, where we were headed to next was a cause for debate.  \"Coach House!\" \"Rusty Spur!\" \"Mondrian!\" \"Santos!\" \"AZ88!\"  Needless to say, me being the foreigner (ie. from Phoenix), I kept my mouth shut and let the crowd take me to wherever. I tried my best veering everyone away from Rusty Spur - something about  combining the Scottsdale scene with country music was a little more than I felt like taking in for one evening.  So we ended up defaulting to AZ88, because, well, it was right there in front of us. With a modern decor and very open seating atmosphere, it was definitely one of those \"see and be seen\" kind of places. Tables of bored gay people looking at other tables of gay people, tables of bored straight people looking at other straight people, and then the random smattering of older folk who weren't giving a rat's ass about all the whiffs of pheremones flying everywhere - they just wanted to sit at the bar and have their waffle fries and martinis in peace.   Some long-time Scottsdale residents told me this place isn't scene-y, and that they've been going here since, well, 1988, but I beg to differ. AZ88 is definitely sceney. Not really my bag, but at least I've been here and can form my own first-hand opinion.  Apart from the human element, the place itself isn't bad. Some interesting art (ie. a big sign saying \"Smoking is the leading cause of statistics\" on the wall above the bar while three big images of cigarette smoke  hung from the windows on the opposite side of the room). Fairly stocked bar - although AZ88 definitely seemed like a froufrou drink kind of place. Bartenders were pretty quick and courteous.   And then after one drink, when folks debated about staying longer or leaving, I opted for the latter. Not that AZ88 is harming anyone, really. I mean, people who enjoy being in front of a mirror for an hour at a time need their own version of Cheers, too. I just happen to not be one of them.  --------------  EDITED TO ADD: I've been here a few more times with friends after hitting SMoCA. Waiters each time seemed to be in dire pain to be serving anyone. WTH did I do to you, waiter? Guess where they can shove their attitude. Bah.",

The first time I went it was just for drinks.  It was very crowded, full of the usual Snottsdale types (you know, $30,000 millionaires).  But the drinks and service were good, so I was kept occupied.    The last time I went was later in the evening after a concert.  I don't know if the waiter was tired but he just couldn't be bothered to wait on us.  I rarely leave a waiter with a one or two dollar tip, but this was an exception.    The food is nothing to write home about...very typical burgers, salads etc.  And it's always crowded.  I really don't think it's for the food...it's just the place to be and it's very close to the Mondrian.  I'd say that the best part of the place is the people watching.  I've never seen so many chickadees working so hard to look and act like Paris Hilton.  Skip it, unless you are desperate for grub or need a good laugh.",

Very disappointed in the vegetables - they were over cooked and tasted  very Smokey. Ended up having them taken off the check in order to resolve some of my disappointment. Grilled cheese was exactly as it should be. Came with waffle fries that were good as well as raw veggies and fruit. Family member had gotten a BLT - which was mediocre. Waitress was very nice but got very busy causing us to  have to wait  over 30 min to get the check we were told that usually everything is great so maybe we just come in a bad night. There we're only a few other people there when we got there though...",

If you just want a quick cocktail or a full dinner this is a great place to eat.   To Drink: Everytime I go I get the Cosmo and let me tell you, these are definitely strong! They taste great and two will definitely get you feeling good, so be careful!  MEALS:  Picnic Chicken - If you are looking for a cold sandwich this is a MUST! The taste of the sliced pears, chicken breast, pecan halves, gorgonzola cheese all together on both pumpernickel and white bread is on point. This is definitely a must!  Cheeseburger - as basic as this may sound, their burgers are definitely also on point. I was hesitant to get a burger as this is a nicer restaurant, but it was worth it. I got all four cheeses and added bacon. Great burger choice!   I posted a photo of the swankiness of this place! Super modern, innovative and cool! Definitely somewhere I will continue to go for dinner! Great job to all the friendly staff and management!",

It was the perfect place to stop and smell the roses. I was here for a Valentine's Day TV interview only steps away by the LOVE sculpture and looking for where to meet one of my gorgeous single girlfriends for some girl talk about men.  I looked in on another place on the walk over but it felt too dark and industrial, though the people inside seemed friendly.   The patio at AZ88 is like a work of art itself. Smart design.   I was hoping my shrimp and spicy slaw would rock my world with moist deliciousness, but while my sinuses opened up, it was a tad dry and underwhelming. But it only barely affects my high from the ambiance and the beautiful Arizona day. There are worse things than a salad that is still better than anything I can whip up, sitting and enjoying great conversation on our cozy private white sofas.",

I thought \"whoa, this place is waaaay too ritzy for my budget!\" It looked uber trendy with an amazing patio with cool people drinking things I couldn't afford... And interesting art installations that change all the time!  But then I found out they actually serve burgers and chicken sandwiches and salads etc. AZ88 was totally affordable! It hasn't changed over the years. The food is still great and the ambience is still really cool. You simply can't find restaurants that look like this that are easily affordable.   So when you go, try the hellfire chips--they sound totally bizarre but are super good--which are homemade potato chips, blue cheese, and hot sauce.  You can't go wrong with the burgers or chicken sandwiches. My favorite is the AZ 88 chicken sandwich, which is essentially a buffalo chicken sandwich. The Four Season salad is also great. And don't forget to save room for dessert! Strawberry shortcake!  After 9 pm or so on the weekends it becomes a very crowded and loud bar, so if you want dinner, I suggest you go before 9. If you want to drink and mingle then you'll definitely want to wait until after 9pm to go.",

I love this place because the food is good, the drinks are good and they have a different Christmas tree every year that makes you anxious to go to see what they have each year. =) I've seen one made of dollar bills, safety pins, martini glasses. This year it looked like a huge lego tree. lol.   For drinks, I've always ordered the Rose. I was bummed because they don't have that on the menu anymore since they can't get the vodka which originally came from France. I ordered the Flirtini and my friend ordered the French. The drinks are a bit pricey here but they are definitely worth it. They are seriously strong and they fill it to the rim!  For food, we always start with the St. Petersburg Potatoes. For food, I've probably had everything on the menu. This time I ordered the Burger Las Brisas. All of the meals come with fruit and waffle fries which are amazing!   This is definitely a great place to come with a date or even a group of friends for some drinks. The ambiance and decor of the place is also amazing. I love it!",

It seems that the competition has really ratcheted up in the Old Scottsdale area with many new, hot places to choose from - at one time AZ88 was THE place to go and but it appears they are still drawing the beautiful people to this stylish dining room and their comfortable and scenic patio.  It's not easy to find but if you make your way to the parking garage and see Los Olivos...you found it.   Their cocktails are innovative and the menu is chock full of signature items like the AZ88 Chicken Sandwich and burgers.  My fav is the Picnic Chicken Sandwich and it did not disappoint.

The service was ridiculously good and the atmosphere incredible. We sat outside, because we could, and enjoyed the gorgeous night air. I had the Las Brisas Hamburger, medium well. Dave asked me why I would destroy a good burger by ordering it that way and some places will ruin a burger when you order it that way, but not this place. It was still juicy and tasty and aromatic. Topped with jalepenos, Monterrey jack and avocado I enjoyed every bite.  I ordered dessert. The turtle sundae. The server suggested the chocolate torte thing but I wanted ice cream. Dave got the torte and let me have a bite and I must confess, I should have gone with that.   The bathroom, wow. So pretty. They doors are labelled at the bottom, a little hard to find without warning. But inside you are bathed in pink light and surrounded by mirrors. Who doesn't look good in pink light? The mirrors are floor to ceiling, even in the stalls. I have never seen myself...you know. But under pink light it wasn't offensive at all.",

To be honest, my server wasn't great (she didn't even notice it was my birthday when she IDed me, or when my friend announced \"it's his birthday!\") but every restaurant has one of those. The burger Alfredo is insane, it's so good! Just watch out because apparently New Jersey moms frequent this place (probably for the attractive young servers :/) I absolutely recommend this place any time of day!",

Our server was great and quick to answer or find the answer to all questions we had regarding the menu. Our food was tasty and arrived at our table quickly. The decor is hip and fun. Overall, a great experience.",

    "text": "At the start of the Old Town drag by the courtyard of the Scottsdale Museum of Contermporary Art (SMoCA) and an art piece dedicated to LOVE stands a longtime jewel of the Old Town scene. At this place, you feel concious of how you appear for there are beautiful women and handsome men with their lovers, and stalkers, laughing, smiling, flirting, kissing, loving... life... and AZ88. This restaurant/nightspot has been a subject of lore. At this place the martinis are big and kickin and for an evening you can feel simply beautiful and sexy. The music is pumpin with sick beats by their dj upstairs. There's an art piece in the center that exudes sex...iness. And the bar reminds you of how this LA-esque place is here in our turf but Scottsdale is not Phoenix, it's a bit of San Diego, a bit of Santa Monica, a bit of the Marina in San Fran. And you realize that its handsome men with handsome men and hot women with sexy ladies and everything in between. This is the place for gay men and women, and straight allies.   The drinks are delish, and exquisite, here a glass of something with bubbles just makes sense, couple it with a martini or two with shaker makes sense. And their burger au poivre just messes with the senses... it's overwhelming and so good! This place is contemporary chic. Not ikea chic like its hot cousin FEZ in our cenpho which in my opinion is attaining landmark status on central. This place celebrates the hotness of the old town crowd. So if ever I want a late night place, and want to see and be the scene. I head over with some hot teases and have a fun time. hope to see you there one night, just wink.",

If my parents ever make it out here from Wisconsin, I'm definitely taking them to AZ 88.  The view of the Scottsdale mall is really cool, and the proximity to a number of the \"old\" Old Town bars is really convenient.  The food is reasonably priced, with most sandwiches and dishes right around $10.  They have a good sized bar selection, with some really interesting imported beers.  I would absolutely recommend the AZ 88 sandwich if you enjoy buffalo sauce, and it's really hard for me to not order the little crackers with onions and bacon on them (even despite disliking bacon!).",

But I did feel like most people there were watching, judging, liking, hating, etc., but if you're partying in Scottsdale, you should expect no less.

Tucked behind a parking garage and a plaza across from the Performing Arts Center in Scottsdale, this place was worth the hunt to find.  The outdoor patio and the immaculate artistic interior which changes monthly won us over.  I will have to give it four stars however as the dinner food didn't seem to match the minimalist interior. I would definitely consider this a lunch or a cock tailing locale.",

    "text": "\"I dig this place.\"  Halfway through our night at AZ88 that's what my husband turned to me and said and I couldn't help but agree.  We went on a Thursday night and it was rather empty, there were several open tables during the entire time we were there.  We went for drinks and we were not disappointed.  I finally found a place here that can make a good mojito!  Woohoo!  I watched the bartender make it himself, sans pre-mix, and he muddled the mint in front of my very eyes.  I saw the Champagne Celebration on the menu but worried it would be too sweet so I opted to have a Kir Royale.  The bartender suggested the Celebration and assured me it wouldn't be too sweet so I ordered it.  It was fantastic!  It was one of the prettiest drinks I've ever had, with colored rock sugar sprinkled on top (which gives it a ever so faint cotton candy aftertaste) and it is basically a mix of a Kir Royale and a Bellini.  My husband asked for  suggestion and was told the Side Car, which he found too sweet and came with a sugar rimmed glass. He then moved to a tried and True Bombay Sapphire martini that was well made and his glass was poured so full that we could clearly see the meniscus on the top.  (And I'm sure we were the only people in the place that knew what a meniscus was...)  The bartender was a little slow in making one of my drinks so he comped it for us which I appreciated.  I wasn't bothered by it because he was the only bartender and clearly could have used help as he had to prepare all the drinks for the bar and the tables.  We didn't order dinner food but I plan on returning with my BFF in two weeks for dinner.  The food is insanely inexpensive, its cheaper than at Chili's!  The atmosphere is great, it's very trendy and upbeat yet still understated.  (It reminds me of 28 Degrees in Boston except with a white motif and not blue)  We did order dessert, the Golden Gate Cake in honor of my little sister who just moved to San Fran this week. (Love you A!) and it was amazingly yummy.    The place is fairly casual really, most folks were wearing their best mall duds from Express so it wasn't overly dressy at all.  In fact, there was a guy in a Budweiser trucker hat that he clearly got for free somewhere. (I will not get into my feelings on trucker hats, Budweiser trucker hats or free hats....)  My husband was in shorts and a t-shirt and he felt fine.  (Plenty of guys came in wearing flip flops...yet another thing I won't get into!)  The crowd was fairly diverse which was nice.    One last thought.  Yes, the bathrooms were cool but it was certainly not the coolest I've ever seen.  (I find that frosting glass or water effects really take bathrooms to a new level.)  One of the stalls in the women's bathroom was lacking tp and the other was dangerously close to that.  There were also kind of messy and smelled faintly of sewage.    I am definitely planning on returning, its nice and out of the way, relaxed and inexpensive. What more could you want?",

This is not a lounge you where must dress to the 9's, I have visited in a pair of jeans, low cut top and a  great pair heels and was happy to grab my fav mojito and burger.    Oh try the blue cheese and hot sauce chips.  It sounds as a strange combo but wowzers was it tasty.  I had never known I could like hot sauce as much. LOL.  If you are a martini fan, try their extra dry dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives.  It's sooo good.  But be careful, they go down rather smooth and quickly.

    "text": "First review for AZ88, however, by far not my first time there nor my last. So let me tell you some History.  In the 1950's Elsa Kopp founded Kopp's Custard Stand in Milwaukee, WI after her husband Karl Kopp developed Parkinson's. By the 1960's it was a popular Milwaukee staple. Elsa's son Karl Kopp is now the owner of Kopp's as well as Elsa's on the Park, located in downtown Milwaukee across the street from Cathedral Square Park, Bar 89 in SoHo NYC (which unfortunately is now closed) and AZ88, Scottsdale, AZ.  AZ88 is named after the State of residence and the year it was opened.  AZ88 as well as the other two restaurants are knew for the somewhat avant garde art work installations in the mostly white walled interiors.  They all have similar menus and offer similar pricing and upscale cocktails.  They are all similar styles with a bar on onside of the restaurant with high ceilings, white washed walls and contemporary furniture.  I have only been to Elsa's On The Park a couple of times but it was the least pretentious.  You will more likely spot a celeb or well know locals at AZ88.  AZ88 and Bar 89 are both frequented by the gay community. One New York restaurant review described Bar 89, palatial as a Grecian Bathhouse with unisex stalls.  You will find AZ88 has a his, a hers and a his/hers restroom.  DJ music from above and floor to ceiling windows that also over look a park at the Scottsdale Civic Plaza.  Just go for cocktails or sit and eat inside or on the patio.  It can get busy nights and weekends, they do not take reservations.  Of course I love the AZ88 chicken sandwich with waffle cut fries and fruit, the AZ88 Chicken salad and the Tuna Nicoise salad.  Actually all the sandwiches are good. The martinis are excellent.  They have a wide range of liquor and offer a variety of top shelf. So, if you prefer a Johnny Walker Blue or the high end Louis XIII de Remy Martin Cognac (they do have a bottle, I was there few days ago) you will not be disappointed.  Or just get a Grey Goose Martini dry and up, I promise they don't use vermouth unless you ask for it.  If you want to beat the crowds and avoid the pushing and shoving at the bar go during the afternoon on a Sunday.

The menu prices seem pretty expensive, especially for drinks. But if you order a liquor with soda they give you a full glass of whatever liquor you ordered along with a bottle of the soda of your choice. So even though it may seem pricey, you're getting at least three drinks worth compared to other bars. I've been a patron of AZ 88 since I was a kid, and have never had an experience that deterred me from going back.",

And there was a woman in front of me who had been waiting longer. It was just really odd. I've never walked into a place that asks you to wait to be seated and NO One is there to assist you with arranging that seating.  The food tastes good, but really over priced for what you are getting. And the seating was pretty cramped. My table got bumped a couple times because it was pretty busy.   I probably wouldn't come here again considering I could make anything on there menu in my own home, and the quality would be just as good. It's just very basic.",

Great vibe, for the white outdoor patio and the loud music gives off a Miami-South Beach theme. Unfortunately, the dirty martinis are a hit or miss. The food isn't something you want to eat prior to a night on the town (wknd). It's ok as far as food or drinks go, but it's a classier crowd then the normal El Hefe OT College Bar crowd-thank goodness! Sooooo that is what keeps me coming back.

I expected the fries to have a nice crunch, but it turned out soft and slightly salty.  =/ Boo, they really looked good too.  The burger though was pretty nice, so i'll give them that.

They change the artwork on the wall behind the bar and on the ceiling every couple of months, which is an interesting touch.  They also have an excellent patio!

I felt like many people there thought they just came from a broadway play in new york and stopped by to have a sandwich and glass of wine.  It's just a little stuffy for my liking but it reminded me that we had actually been there 2 or 3 years before.  Didn't know the name before because we went there late night before and stumbled upon it with a group.  We went there because of Yelp but probably won't go back unless it's for late night food.  The dipping waffle fries, bacon wrapped chesnuts, and jalapeno chicken sandwich were all good.  However, the waffle fries at Chik Fil La are just as good.  The chicken sandwich was tasty but we could make it at home and it would be just as good.  Ultimately, we all go out for good food, atmosphere, people watching, and to socialize.  You can get all of things here for sure.  I would personally rather go to any number of other places in Scottsdale or Phoenix though.  BTW, our waitress really did a nice job and tried very hard to be responsive.  Again, that counts for something.",

It was a little hard to find the entrance to the place, but seeing as it was about 90 seconds walk from the hotel I wasn't complaining!  The decor is very modern minimalist, and the patio was lovely - perfect for a warm Fall evening. Our server was friendly and attentive all evening, she never intruded on conversation but seemed to find the perfect moment to jump in and see how we were doing. I ordered the Garden Truck Chicken Sandwich with extra avocado (how could I not? I'm a sucker for avocado...) which came with waffle fries and fruit. The sandwich was super delicious, and the avocado took it to the next level. The vegetables were fresh and added a great crunch to the sandwich, and the chicken was well cooked. I can never resist waffle fries, but I thought the fruit was a bit of a weird choice; it just didn't seem to fit with the rest of the dish.  I had a local IPA with my sandwich, which was very good! I would have liked a little more assistance in choosing my beer from the server, but I can't complain - I'm a local beer fiend, and I can't blame other people for not knowing every in and out of their local beer scene!  The proximity to the hotel, and the pleasant time we had will definitely have me coming back to AZ 88 - I've gotta try some of those cocktails!",

The place is very hip and full of the attractive Scottsdale crowd, even at 10pm on a weeknight.  We didn't go an adventure with the drinks, just a tap beer and some wine, both of which were good.  We started with the St Petersburg potatoes.  I had not read any reviews on them, but they sounded intriguing.  They were waaaaay better than I was anticipating.  There were not just fried potatoes with some smoked salmon thrown on them.  There were quite a few flavors and texturing that worked very well together.    My fiancee got the chicken sandwich grilled in butter and I got the AZ88 chicken salad.  I thoroughly enjoyed mine.  The buffalo sauce was very strong but being a lover of chicken wings I did not mind at all.  The girl wasn't too crazy about her sandwich saying that it was too buttery.  We will definitely be back to try some more options.",

    "text": "AZ 88 is a great spot in Scottsdale for cool vibes and a cool atmosphere.  It is located at the Scottsdale Civic Center and the patio over looks the Scottsdale Center for the Arts.  If you are looking for a good patio in the area, definitely check it out.    The menu is good, tries to be interesting but it's just variations of appetizers, salads and chicken sandwiches.  It's a casual menu with an upscale twist which is nice for the area.  The prices are pretty reasonable also.  Salads and Sandwiches are $12-$14 and the portions are a good size.  The  drink menu is also very impressive with tons of wines, rums, and craft beers to choose from.  We started with the house made chips with lox and cream cheese on top.  Huge portion but I think they forgot half the lox.  Interesting dish but I probably won't order it again.  I had the AZ 88 salad for dinner which was great!  It's a chopped salad with grilled buffalo chicken on top.  The sandwiches come with waffle fries which is always a plus in my book!",

They brought out a bowl of water for our puppy, and the staff fawned over her - which we loved!   They were all very friendly, and service was top notch!   The food was wonderful as well. I ordered one of their salads, and it was delicious! We enjoyed everything about this place, and will definitely be back!!",

Although service for our large group was slow, even with calling ahead they seemed a bit overwhelmed trying to accommodate us all.  I had their amazing hot pepper chicken sandwich, marinated in lime juice, drizzled in honey and topped with spicy jalapenos, practically perfect with waffle fries and a fresh mix of bite size fruit & vegetables.(if for nothing else but to add color to the plate) I'm looking forward to returning and trying the hell fire chips & AZ 88 chicken sandwich, so many tasty bites to choose from. However I did get to delight in a bite of of melt in your mouth strawberry cheesecake, I think I heard angels singing or perhaps that was my tipsy fellow patrons, either way it was a bite of heaven!  AZ 88 is a must try, a place to see and be seen(no doubt an eye opening experience in the facilities, you'll have to see for yourself) and definitely place to return!",

We went on a Sunday night and it was pretty quiet. Service was great and they were all super friendly.   FOOD!   I had The Chicken sandwich and added bacon and cheese. Twas good, needed a little flavor, but the honey mustard helped.   We also had the grilled cheese, twas tasty and very cheesy.   I had an Old Fashioned, and man o man, IT WAS BOMB! It is hard to find a place that even knows what an Old Fashioned is, let alone make a good one. Don Draper would approve.   Had a sundae....not so bomb....just you average sundae...flavorless whip cream.   Cheesecake was pretty good.   Prices were pretty awesome for the atmosphere it provides. They could charge more for the location and atmosphere.   It is easy to get lost. Most GPS take you to a parking garage...park in there and exit out of the NE corner. On your right will be a Mexican restaurant and AZ 88 is on your left.",

    "text": "Wow!!!  I love this place.   I have just discovered it has the best burger I have ever had too!  \"Burger Au Poivre Ii,\" is bold and complete in flavor, my mouth is watering as I write this review.  Eating this burger is almost like the first time you eat thai food.  It is a combination of flavors that you didn't expect, but it is so perfect, that it becomes your new favorite.  The \"Burger Au Poivre Ii\" does have bleu cheese on it, so if you are not a stout pallet, perhaps you should pick something lighter.      I also drank an English Garden with my burger, if in case it happened to be the combination which induced the state of epicurean nirvana from which I am writing.",

I did not have the Burger Au Poivre II, nor did I order the Thai Chicken Salad that seemed fantastic - I merely drank and enjoyed service and company.   While the service didn't impress, the company did. And so did the overall ambiance. This is a nice place and I do intend to come back here and start an evening. But when I was here the service had quite a bit to ask for. Maybe it was busy, and they were understaffed for the evening - but that is hardly my assumption to make. But with that part of my evaluation flawed, the overall impression is still a good and lasting one.  Another kudos to the awesome bathrooms. Adorable as a memento, terrible when one is buzzed and tries to focus in a hallucinogenic turquoise light while needing to pee.   Soon I will explore thy menu, AZ88 - don't let me down.",

    "text": "I went here for dinner and drinks with my husband and sister-in-law last weekend and we had a great time. The three of us sat outside and that's what I'd recommend for anyone visiting AZ 88. The atmosphere is much more relaxed and less sterile than the interior dining area.   We ordered the ceviche as an appetizer and it was delicious. Being from Florida,  I'm sort of a ceviche snob. It wasn't the best I've ever had but it was very good and I'd definitely order it again. The homemade tortilla chips really elevated the dish to another level. They were the perfect texture. They started very crispy but softened just the right amount when piled with ceviche.   My husband and sister-in-law ordered the grilled cheese and both of them liked it. I didn't try any of it...because neither offered me a bite. I guess that it was too good to share! I had the cobb salad and it was fresh and tasty. The bleu cheese dressing was good and the crispy bacon was perfectly cooked.   The best part was, by far, the drinks. I ordered a Moscow Mule and it came in a copper mug. It's always supposed to be served like this but so many places around here cut corners and serve it in a glass. The acid from the limes has to react with the copper mug in order to create the True flavor of a Moscow Mule and I really appreciated their attention to detail. Also, I was surprised that the drinks weren't more expensive. They were by no means cheap but I just expected them to be a lot more at a place like this.  If I had to say anything negative it would be about the bathrooms. Don't get me wrong, they were clean and well-kept but the doors were confusing. They had changing lights under the doors and everything was glass. It was confusing...especially after several drinks. Is it too much to ask for a picture of a man or woman on the appropriate bathroom door?",

The cheesy jazz music played in the restaurant gave me a pounding headache during the experience and lasted throughout the rest of the day. Again, and hour and a half of my life I will never get back. The Falsely advertised \"grilled vegetables \" showed more similarities to a bag of microwave Birdseye vegetables than a good entree. They also lacked the knowledge on how to make fries that could be enjoyed by people that did not have silver hair. On my ride back to the hotel I had several episodes where my pants filled with a furious river of diarrhea. The last thing that I have to notify you about is the extremely inappropriate bathroom situation,  my eight-year-old came running out crying after watching videos called perversion for profit he is now in therapy for PTSD!!!",

The kids walked around outside the restaurant while we could see them from the patio.   This is probably not a place for kids (too trendy), but we were fine being placed outside. The doors to the restrooms are interesting. The white doors blend into the walls. Only the words on the very bottom tell you it's a bathroom. Unique.",

The atmosphere is very minimal but interesting with a regularly changing ceiling center piece throughout the year.  The outdoor seating is very pleasant (not in the summer) especially when the concerts in the park are happening.  The drinks are always good but the martinis are wonderful.  They are quite large and the bartenders fill them to the rim.  It is fun to watch the staff deliver the martinis without spilling a drop.  I have tried most things on the menu but the AZ88 Chicken Sandwich is the one to try first.  Simply... excellent!  Interesting note: They have a sister restaurant in Milwaukee called Elsa's on the Park.  Another great place to go if and when you are in Milwaukee.",

The outside seating area is what draws you in, I don't know what to call them but the illuminated kayak boat-looking sculptures that hang overhead are just gorgeous! Looking at them from underneath is cool but when you look at them from outside the restaurant it's a masterpiece! The inside as well does not disappoint, with the ever changing wall behind the bar to the cool bathrooms and floor to ceiling glass walls, this place is definitely here to impress the eye! And I love the music that they play here. Location is perfect, it's around so many things in Old Town Scottsdale I'm sure if you're strolling by it's not hard to miss!   The customer service is 5/5. Our waiter was super nice, he started us out with some water without us having to ask, which is a sign of great customer service from the beginning in my opinion. He constantly checked back with us to see if we needed anything and was helpful with suggesting things on the menu.  Food was outstanding. Appetizers were plentiful sizes in itself, entrees were well worth every bite. My company got the appetizer wings and it came with waffle fries, it was such a big serving to be just an appetizer! I'm not much of an alcohol drinker but my company let me try what they got, the Moscato was really smooth and tasted great! The prices are definitely reasonable for what you get. Only bummers were that they don't have many veg friendly options and they don't offer anything for birthdays.  Overall, this place is super swanky and hip, from the customer service to the vibe, ambiance and decor. It's hard to find anything that I didn't like here!",

It comes with whipped cream and butterscotch. Pro Tip: Try to get a little of everything in each bite.  Each time I go my experience is made magical because of the server Chris. He absolutely gives the best service and I know that he'll never disappoint. Thank you Chris for making every meal more than great!",

    "text": "AZ88 in Scottsdale is the sister restaurant of Hanny's in downtown Phoenix. You guessed it, it opened in Arizona in 1988. I have been coming here since 1995 when I heard about it from my college roommate.  I have been a loyal customer ever since!  It is located in the Scottsdale Mall right by Scottsdale Center for the Arts in a large open floor plan modern building. It hasn't changed at all since I started going there in 1995 and it really doesn't need to. Simple works! Occasionally they will have an art installation that will be up for a few months.   Service is always great. Especially from a young woman named Shqipe (yes I spelled it right) that I always request. She has been taking care of me at AZ88 for years and is the best!   Let's talk about the important things, the food and drinks. Cocktails are all pretty amazing. They have a large drink menu with just about anything you can think of. Their specialty is the martinis but their cocktails are fantastic as well. One of my favorite cocktails is the champagne celebration...Champagne, chambord and peach schnapps mixed together and topped off with sugar sprinkles. Delicious!   Martinis are served in a large hand blown glass and are filled to the rim. The martinis are not cheap here though, average is $15, but well worth it.   AZ88's food is wonderful. They have great appetizers, great sandwiches, salads, amazing burgers and entrees. I always order the gallettes to start which is a flat bread sprinkled with bacon, sauteed onion, black olives and Parmesan cheese. Amazing! The chicken and bacon club is another one of my favs. I also really enjoy the AZ88 chicken salad which is basically a cobb salad with sliced buffalo chicken breast. Hot and spicy. Yaaaas! Everything they have has a uniqueness.   This review would be pages long if I kept going. Bottom line, I have not had a bad thing here ever!   Check out AZ88, you will be glad you did!  It's usually pretty busy every day of the week, Friday and Saturday though it's pretty packed so be prepared. They do not take reservations unless you have a large party but you have to call to discuss arrangements.    Enjoy!",

Ordered the St. Petersburg which is basically chips topped with cucumber, beats, cream cheese and salmon (although it could have used more salmon). It tasted fine, and the \"Hot Dog\" drink was not bad either.  Prices are up there a bit, but what do you expect from Scottsdale? I say it's a good place to come in for a drink or quick bite. Other than that, their menu seems to be sandwiches, burgers, and a few plates.  Definitely a place to stop by if you are on a night out with friends and you want that posh experience!",

I was considering the Moose bar as a sportier alternative but I'm glad I picked to go here. I got there before my friend did, so I seated myself outside on the patio. You have a nice view of the farmer's market and a music stage. Too bad the music was terrible. The patio seating also has this cool glass rectangular prism things surrounding it.  Anyhow, I ordered an old fashioned cocktail. Pretty tasty. I ordered the chicken calabrese which came with the waffle fries. The sandwich was soooo good. It had 2 juicy chicken breasts and bell pepper and onions. It was delicious. My friend enjoyed his Caesar salad. I would definitely come back here for brunch.",

What a disappointment!  The place looks old and run down. The service was awful, even with our plan to get there after 1 p.m., after the lunch rush (if there even was one). After we seated ourselves (weird), it took forever for the server to come take our order. The bacon on my BLT was super fatty and the lettuce on the sandwich and in the garnish was super wilted. The fruit wasn't ripe, so it was hard and tasted sour (except for the grapes, which were mushy). My lunch partner offered me some potato chips, which were soft and stale. We didn't realize we had no silverware or napkins until after the server brought us our lunch and left. She never came back, so I had to get up and find someone to bring them to us. LBNL, we waited too long for the check. Finished with AZ88. Definitely not what it used to be...",

The restaurant is smack dab in the middle of some public park which was sort of cool and had a large outdoor patio that was great for al fresco dining. The ambiance was nice - clean, contemporary, open setting. We had to wait a bit for a table outside so we sat at the bar for a cocktail...many were these martinis large and stiff!  Once seated we enjoyed some crudite and then proceeded to order some tasty burgers (I had been told that was what you had to get there). They were pretty impressive burgers, not going to lie.  The bathrooms here are a trip. They were confusing to find (no handles, the only indication that it is a bathroom was some small marking at the bottom of the door, etc.). The interiors are covered with mirrors with colored lights everywhere. It was sort of hard to figure out where the urinal, sinks, etc. were. Was definitely the most interesting restaurant bathrooms I've ever experienced.  The prices weren't too bad, and overall it was a great place to stop int he area.",

The bathrooms are pretty crazy and definitely worth checking out so make sure you have to go sometime in between your visit. Enjoy the peep show videos in the unisex bathroom.  As far as appetizers go, we get the potato skins/fries with the salmon. It's pretty legit. I heard the drinks are good here especially the martinis. It's not on the menu but if you ask for a mango martini it will definitely not let you down. The espresso martini is probably a second runner-up to it. Every entree we've gotten have been extremely delectable.  I tried 2 different plates and 4 different burgers and haven't been let down yet. I still cry and whine when everybody says they want to come here because I have to keep up my image, but I definitely like this place.

This is definitely not the kind of place I would have expected to stumble into and order a burger. When we were actually looking for it we passed it, thinking it couldn't be what he was referring to (the signage isn't obvious).   As a lot of people have mentioned, the decor is definitely fancy, and we were not particularly dressed up. I thought we might feel out of place, but once inside the atmosphere was quite inviting, and made great conversation. I actually felt like I was transported to 1988, complete with a business card inserted in the first page of the menu quoting Zsa Zsa Gabor.  Beyond that, the bathrooms were unlike any I've experienced. Very spaceship-esque.. Definitely check them out! I had the feeling that many an elicit substance has been consumed in there over the years.   The food was good - I had the grilled cheese sandwich and added avocado (a generous portion). The fries were a bit bland and the veggies (also served on the side) left something to be desired. Drinks were generous and their wine prices were reasonable.  Service was good. Not the best I've received in the Scottsdale area but nothing to complain about either.   Overall I would say go for the decor and experience of it and stay for the cocktails and reasonable menu prices!",

So we were expected to suck on these straws which now touched whatever else those bare hands touched prior to serving us??  We were appalled by this unsanitary service.  Can we safely assume that she practices  good hygiene  in all instances including after going to the bathroom.?  When she was informed of our concern, she told us that all the straws in AZ88 come without wrappers.  Who knows what other unhygienic practices go on.

    "text": "We came here with a big group, and our server took great care of us. Not exactly my kind of ambiance, but so what? The bathrooms creeped me out though.  I'd say the food was mixed. Some of it was fantastic: the homemade fries, the teriyaki wings, the galettes. The burgers would have been great, except mine and my wife's were both way too potent. I had the Burger Las Brisas, and the jalapenos were too much for the rest of the burger. My wife had the Burger au Poivre II and the bleu cheese completely overpowered her burger as well (I've tried other bleu cheese burgers with much better balance).  Hands-down, the cheesecake they shipped in from the Carnegie Deli really was the best I've ever had (w/ strawberries). I said that before I had even see where it came from.  I'll definitely consider going back for dessert after a trip to the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art. (Probably with a side of french fries)",

Apparently he's a newbie who just finished training as a bartender a few weeks ago but you couldn't even tell. Came back and sat on the patio on Thursday at a nice shady table with Mitch as our server. He was very attentive, always refilling waters, grabbing extra ketchup or mustard, and making sure the drinks kept flowing. Had a nice chat with some other servers and the manager too when he brought our food out. Looking forward to coming back for weekend night with friends!",

It's one thing to have a small garnish of cucumber in a drink but the flavor of the huge slice they put it the mug totally overpowered the drink even after I had pulled it out. 2) Don't get me wrong, I had plenty to eat and left with a full stomach from the burger and waffle fries, but for AZ 88 to consider 1 baby carrot and 1 piece of broccoli as a side of vegetables and 1 piece of honeydew and 1 small piece of pineapple as a side of fruit...what's the point? It's not even worth mentioning, or serving for that matter. All in all, I'd be happy coming back to eat at AZ 88 again (but I would order a different cocktail or get the delicious tropical unsweet tea); it just didn't jump to the top of my list of favorites in the valley.",

Shrimp appetizer was very good but the waiter was well we barely had a waiter.  The guy who sat us gave us his little tude right off the bat!  We did not get our appetizer until well let's see, we could have called it dessert!    This is the way I look at it, if you don't have great customer service.  You might as well call it a day!  The waiter apologized and then began to inform me he had been a waiter for 13 years.  My reply was simple, then he should have known by now how to do his job!  That line does not work on me, if you have been doing it for 13 years then you are still doing it WRONG.    Nice outside seating!  But if you want water, you better take a bottle from home.",

It's a relaxed atmosphere and a beautiful restaurant. I'm always a fan of restaurants with a lot of natural light.   The bad: their lunch menu is decent, but the dinners are really lacking. I've tried to give their food a chance, but just haven't fallen in love. Same goes for the cocktails. I ordered a Moscow mule, and it was very disappointing.   If you go in with the expectation that it will be a culinary feast, you will be disappointed. If you want a decent chicken sandwhich or salad for lunch, and want to cool, bright spot to enjoy it, then az88 would be a good choice!",

The most notable thing for me personally was that AZ 88 appeared to be the spot (or at least one of the few spots) in Scottsdale open late enough on a weekday night to suit my Vegas lifestyle. I mean, I am  not generally one to ask, \"Where can a girl get a drink in this town?\" But, on this occasion I did, and AZ 88 stepped up.   They have a fabulous patio and a nice list of swanky cocktails. I just really enjoyed the atmosphere sitting outside, sipping on libations. I enjoyed a fine Pimm's Cup, and even though I didn't drink it, the Celebratory Champagne complete with confetti was entertainment for the entire table. My drinking companion relished it so much, she decided to order confetti in every glass of her champagne.   Confetti. Cocktails. What's not 5-stars about that?",

There's a \"Celebratory Champagne\" cocktail that involves colored confetti sugar sprinkled in to the drink table-side (and, in fact, all of the cocktails are very good), 2. The cocktail prices here are beyond reasonable for the swanky vibe, and 3. The spot is open pretty damn late for being in an otherwise seemingly-dead part of town.   Located right behind the Saguaro, AZ88 was our go-to bar for late night shenanigans, as most of the other bars in the immediate area seemed to be closed. I was impressed by everything I consumed at this bar, and surprised at the resulting bill (having spent the prior days overpaying for drinks in hotel bars in Sedona and Scottsdale). $7 or $8 for a Buffalo Trace Manhattan is good by any standards.   Service here was on point during both visits, and did a solid job of splitting checks and keeping up with our ever-growing/changing crowd.   The food I sampled here was decent but nothing mind-blowing. However I'd come back in for drinks any time. And sing \"WOOOOO\" every time someone gets some confetti sugar sprinkled in their champagne cocktail.",

The crowd is very pretty on the weekends, filled with the latest fashions, jewlery, and cologne.

(I never knew you could use mirros in such a way).    AZ88 is also known for it's martinis...which they fill to the rim and deliver to your table without loosing a drop.  The food is dressed up bar food. You'll get a burger with a lemon wedge....for example.  Overall a great place and has been for years.  The art is always changing and defintely gives up good conversation.  You will always have a fun time at AZ88.",

I've noticed that the service has steadily gotten better over the last few months, not that anything was wrong before, but tonight and the last few times I've been, it was bordering on Mary Elaine's-ish levels of service, which is pretty freakin great for a burger spot with loud dance music.

Still have great cocktails and the burgers are some of the best in the Valley. Service always was and still remains great. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "5 stars for the room. I think it kicks ass. Love the glass. Love the av ant Gard holiday garb. Sparse modern decor makes me smile. Patio is fan freakin tastic. 3 stars for the food. Average, right? C'mon really? Water chestnuts, wrapped in bacon with a side of honey? Not a honey sauce, but honey? Oh honey, pahhllleeeze. The average chicken sandwich. Average. Average. Average. 2 stars for the service. OK. We know you're pretty. We know you never look your guests in the eyes, cuz you're busy cruising for a quickie in the restroom (5 stars for the johns....I've heard they're good for quickies...somebody told me...yea, that's right, somebody told me!) You don't know your grigios from noirs. And you think arugula is one of the Spice Girls. Uggggh. 4 stars for the martinis. You give \"fill it to the rim with brim\" a whole new twist. Not so full  it's half spilled on the servers hand and the stem of the glass, however. Even though I will lick 'em both clean to get my dollar's worth.  You do the math...3 stars, right?",

    "text": "AZ88, the cousin of Hanny's, brings more glitz and better food selections than is Downtown relative.  My friend had a killer salad with buffalo chicken and I had a tremendously delicious burger with avocado, jalapenos, and salsa.  They were able to accommodate my desire to skip the fruit and veggie sides and go all waffle fries for me.  When I asked for dipping sauces beside ketchup, I got three choices.  I would only complain that their water glasses are far too small, especially for some of their spicier dishes.  I think the expectation is that you have cocktail to help you wash away some of the heat.  Speaking of their cocktails, the martinis, which I have had on a different occasion, are quite good.  This place definitely provides for an evening out and makes you forget that you live in Phoenix.",

Grilled veggies are so tasty, I don't know what that marinade is but it is so flavorful. Great wine selection and caring staff. I highly recommend checking it out. And the bathrooms are a hoot!",

If I was here when it was wamer and could have waited/drank out on the patio probably would have given them a 5.  There indoor waiting space was crowded and felt like I was intruding on the people dining.",

    "text": "I feel like a major douche giving AZ88 five stars, since it is the douchiest doucheclub in all of Doucheville aka Scottsdale. But let me focus on the positive before you get mad at me for mocking Scottsdale... I have no choice but to admit it: this place does what it purports to do extremely well. And that deserves 5 stars.   It's not promising you a nitty gritty urban experience, so why get mad it for not being that? It's Scottsdale at its Scottsdaliest. Why would anyone come here, knowing what it is, and then complain? In fairness, that probably irritates me about as much as people who move to the Phoenix area in general and then complain about it. Shut up! Unless your name is Jerry Colangelo or Robert Sarver, no one cares that you don't like it here! Go home if you don't! I'll even give you a free ride to the airport!  AZ88 is a fancy schmancy designer lounge with lots of girlie drinks (I happen to like girlie drinks for the record, and am confident enough in my masculinity to order them in public), plush designer couches, and hip, elegant artsy decor. Pretty symbolic and representative of Scottsdale culture in general. If you're allergic to that vibe, as is your constitutional right to be, just stay away and everyone will be happy. But if you like to mix it up a little now and then, this should definitely be on your list for experiencing Scottsdale. The design is definitely my favorite part, especially the outdoor banana-like thing that covers the patio, and the cool all-glass pillars that surround the patio. Owner Karl Kopp spent a poop-load of money designing this place and continues to do so to maintain it. (I believe Kopp completely revamps the interior art once a month, without fail, so all the people who made fun of the lame logo on the wall in earlier reviews are, ironically, simply out-dated).  He sort of knows what he's doing, since he also runs a successful trendy bar in Manhattan. He's also building a new one in downtown Phoenix (expected opening date: May 2008).   I came here for a late lunch earlier today (my first time eating here actually), and ordered the \"hamburger au poivre, deux\". It was drowning in peppercorns, and I am madly in love with peppercorns so it was a hamburger fantasy come True.",
