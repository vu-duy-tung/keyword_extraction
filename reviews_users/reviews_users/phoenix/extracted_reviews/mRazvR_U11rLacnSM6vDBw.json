    "text": "**Updated Review**  Came back again and this time brought 3 more friends who haven't been. The service that we received was absolutely terrible. When the waiter would change our grill, they transfer whatever we are cooking onto the new grill. Each time they did this, they didn't care that our meat would literally splatter all over the table. Such a waste of food and they didn't even bother cleaning it up. Absolutely unacceptable that this happened 3 times on the same visit.  Do yourself a favor and try the other Korean bbq in town.   ---------------------------------------------------- Decided to try this yesterday and it definitely did not disappoint! We did the $21.99 all you can eat and we were seated pretty fast. Great side dishes and the quality of the meat is pretty good as well! The bulgogi and brisket was so delicious.  The only downside was the service. Since you get to order 3 items at a time, after our first initial order it was pretty difficult to catch the attention of one the servers to place our next 3 items. This continued for the rest of our lunch whether it may be requesting more side dishes and water. It wasn't terribly busy so I'm not sure if the place was just short staffed at the time when I came in. Other than that, I think the price point and the quality of food that you are getting is pretty worth it! I will definitely come back again!",

There is no need to go with the more expensive premium menu - the regular menu at $22 is good enough.  Kids under 10 eat for $11.  Ranking of meat taste/quality from best to worst:  1.  beef belly - more tender than the brisket 2.  chadol baegi 3.  galbi - waaay better than Gen's galbi 4.  bulgogi 5.  jumooluk 6.  beef rib meat 7.  spicy pork belly 8.  octopus - wasn't marinated in gochujang or anything 9.  intestine - it is what it is, it's just something to chew on  Vegetables make for good grilling companions, the soybean paste stew tastes way better than the soondubu, banchan is tasty, and the steamed egg is passable.  They offer two types of salads, and I liked the onion-cilantro one better than the lettuce one, but both were good.  Hite was ice-cold.  No dduk wrap here.  We were allowed 3 plates per order, but the food came out fast and more orders were put in really quickly, and the portion sizes were actually quite large.  Service was fast, efficient, and friendly.  The grill vents that descend from the ceiling kept the smoke after-smell to a minimum, and the ambiance was family-friendly and comfortable.  Meat quality is expected for AYCE, but the food here at Manna is of considerably higher quality than Gen's.   Factor in the lower prices at Manna, and it's easy to see that Gen comes in a distant 2nd in the race to claim the title of Phoenix's best Korean AYCE BBQ restaurant.",

We were seated right away; we went about an hour before close. We were behind a partition and it made it a bit harder for the servers to see us, and that got a bi frustrating. We needed a server a little more often than they came but I think that was due to us being tucked into the corner.   They have a plethora a Korean side dishes that kept things interesting while eating. We had the bolgolgi, some beef ribs, sweet pork, and spicy pork, and some more that we just pointed at and got. There was only one item we didn't like the taste of but I think that's what we get for ordering some random stuff. Deserts sadly do not come with the all you can eat, throw a man some Mochi!  I'd definitely say the place was worth it, but try to get a seat in the main isle you see when you come in. There is more traffic and you'll probably get better service.",

The first on the raw pork jaw that had just come out of the kitchen and the second time I didn't even notice until I had dipped the meat in the sauce and saw it had been cooked into the meat. From where I sat in the back near the kitchen, the kitchen workers did not wear any form of restraint to pull back their hair. Also, it took them up to 6 calls of the bell to finally get a server, mind you, it wasn't very busy at all, to come change our grill and tell them there was a hair in our meat. Coming from someone who also works at a korean bbq restaurant that has the bell system, I found that to be very unacceptable. Although the quality of meat is slightly better than Gen in Tempe, the service itself was lacking. Good tasting food isn't the only thing that makes a restaurant good, what makes it good is that the staff is able to communicate between themselves and the customers to ensure an overall pleasant experience.",

I would give this place a 4 with high expectations of it getting to 5 after they get their kinks sorted out.  As for the restaurant, it's a good size and clean.  The meat selection is comparable to other AYCE K-BBQ places and the prices are very reasonable for what you get.  Side dishes, though, could use some work.  Staffing is friendly and working hard to service their customers but they were short staffed during my visit with the 2 waitresses and a manager serving the front.  Manager did assure me, apologetically, that they were still working out their opening staffing needs and considered it a prority to resolve.  For newbies, K-BBQ can be intimidating and difficulties in communication can create misunderstandings.  Looking forward to many future visits here.",

    "text": "Visited last week Friday on a lunch date with my husband.  As soon as I walked in, the delicious aroma of the Korean BBQ made my stomach grumble.  You pick between two menus.  Everyone at the table has to agree to order from the same menu.    The food was delicious, waiters are very friendly and my favorite part was their call button.  Yes, they have a call button! Try placing your order at Gens, all their waiters are busy trying to act busy, but Manna's they check up on you.  Great service!  The downside to Manna's was when I used the daikon wrap for my meat, I had to spit out the mouthful of food into my napkin because I swear I could taste ammonia.  I don't know how well try to avoid cross contaminating their food, but I definitely tasted it on the daikon wraps.    The second downside of Manna's BBQ is their drinks.  For $1.99 you get one can of soda & no refills :( If you want a refill, pay another buck 99 for another can.   To offset the negative, for parents with children, they have a set rate of $10.99 for kids up to 10 or 12. I can't remember.  Gens measure your kid and if they're 40 inches (I could be wrong with the height), you pay full price.  I call that discrimination on Gens. Ha!   Oh, and their hot soups are so tasty! I loved it!",

We never had to wait long for food, and water was always refilled. They were also really efficient with the grill change.   The reason for the 4 stars instead of the 5 is because we had 8 in our party (6 adults, 2 kids), and the booth we sat in was not conducive to this party size. The booth only had 1 grill and we constantly had to wait for food to cook. The kids had to sit at the end and they had to constantly get up for the grill change. At some point, one of the servers even brought out a metal rolling tray to put next to our table because there was not enough space. Booths are just not comfortable for 8 people. Better seating options for a large crowd is desperately needed at this location.",

It was very thinly sliced and delicious when dipped in the dark sauce.   Steamed egg was also light and fluffy.  Service was much more attentive than other places I've been.

    "text": "This would probably be a 4-star but read below for why it is 2.  I have been to many Korean BBQ places and I know good meat when I eat them. This place has EXCELLENT meats, specifically the ribeye and the beef tongue. If you are stopping by for the first time, I highly recommend to try these two meats. Even though beef tongue may not sound as appetizing to some, the meat looks very different than a \"tongue\" that you would imagine. It also has a total different level of texture that may be surprising to you. Manna's dark-looking dipping sauce is really delicious. Do try to dip your meats in it. I would grill jalapenos and garlic that you can request and put them in this delicious sauce for some spiciness!  Here are why it is a 2-star review. First of all, we paid about 30$ per person for the highest all-you-can-eat tier. You would think it is truly all you can eat; however, they put a limitation on the ribeye. I was told by the waitress that we cannot get another piece of ribeye because there are only two of us. Only one piece is provided for a party of  2, two pieces for a party of 3 and three pieces for a party of 5. In my head I was thinking \"so is it half a piece if I go in and eat by myself? What about a party of 4?\" This really doesn't make any sense and there is no sign in the front desk or on the menu about such limitation. I call this a scam. Second, the vent wasn't working at all. In fact, none of the vents were functional. We were dying of smokes from our table and all the other tables.   Besides the complaints above, their side dishes were average and their service was neither excellent nor terrible. BE WARNED: soft drinks are NOT REFILLIABLE.",

I came here with a group of friends, and we ended up getting the A2 option (A2 is ~$22pp, and A1 is ~29pp). We all agreed that the Galbi was by far the best option - we all liked it so much that we ended up ordering at every round!   Service was prompt and friendly, and we never felt forgotten, even though our group was in the back room. I never even had to ask for extra banchan or water refills, which I really appreciated! Also, they were able to seat a party of 7 at 8p on a Friday, with only a 5-10min wait.. that was pretty amazing considering we decided to come here last minute and hadn't called ahead for a wait estimate :)  While I've gone to a Gen in another state before, I can't compare Manna to the Gen in Az.. however, I'd assume they're pretty similar? Manna is just better for me location wise, and I like that it is right next to the new Asiana market, in case I end up needing to do grocery shopping while waiting or afterwards. If you're craving Korean bbq, I'd highly recommend coming to Manna!",

    "text": "A new Korean BBQ place that opened up right next to the new and impressive Asiana Market location. I don't know what's going on in West Mesa with all Korean spots popping up, but I'm loving it! All you can eat heaven!  A few rules to All you can Eat Korean BBQ: you can pick out 2-3 meats at a time (we got two different answers on two different occasions). There is a 2 hour maximum, so don't expect to camp out all day just stuffing your face. Large portions of meat that was not eaten may be an additional charge, so don't get your eyes bigger than your tummy!   TIPS:   Don't forget that you are the grillmaster, so ask your server how to control the heat volume before throwing down on some K-BBQ. There are doorbells at each table to summon your server for when you're ready to place another order.   I highly recommend getting the premium meat package just under $30 per person. Everything we tried-pork, chicken, beef was all good quality and premium cuts. I like to order a small bowl of rice and thinly sliced radishes (called \"moo\"). Ban Chan (side dishes) are good to add to each protein bite. My fave is using the moo (radish slice) as a mini taco. I put a bit of rice, meat, & gochujang red paste on the moo slice and eat it in one bite. It is so bomb. Get creative, mix and match flavors!  Try a bottle of soju (clear rice wine) with friends, or some makkoli (creamy, white rice wine--the oldest alcoholic beverage in Korea) to catch a buzz. Then head over next door for some dessert to go at the bakery, Tous Les Jours, which so much reminds me of the popular bakery chain in Seoul, Paris Baguette. Or walk off your meal and check out Asiana Market--an awesome Korean grocery store.   Manna BBQ is not only a great all you can eat experience with quality food-- it is also part of a K-town movement that is unfolding right before our eyes here in the Valley.",

You definitely don't go to an all you can eat kbbq place for the service and what's nice is that they have a call button if your table needs attention. I felt like I was constantly pushing the button for something, but that's okay. I love how clean the place is presented and how full I end up leaving.

Aside from that, I think Gen is still the superior option, with a tastier selection of meat and sauces.  The service was good.  The atmosphere was less trendy than Gen, but that wasn't a drawback for me (I tend to like quieter places better anyhow). What was nice was how big the serving sizes were - they definitely don't skimp!  You don't get seated until the entire party is present.  However, I prefer Gen for one reason.  The reality of it all is that Gen offers spicy fried Korean chicken wings on their basic menu, and Manna BBQ does not.  And I really, really like having fried chicken as an option for KBBQ.  Take a look at Manna's basic non-premium menu. If the selection looks good enough for you, then it's probably more worth it for you to skip Gen's super long lines and just go here.",

Their fried rice was also very yummy by itsself too !! The potato salad side they have was AMAZING!!! Had to ask for more lol Customer service was great also, everyone here was so helpful ! Always asking if we needed anything else, if we were okay, and also they were very quick!! Loved it ! One thing i would change would be having fountain drinks, we paid alot for soda but i guess thats just on us for drinking so much lol cant blame them on this. But this place was beautiful and i will definitely come again!!",

I usually go for the 21.99 and to be honest I don't even know what is in the pricier one because I don't feel like I'm missing anything.   My only complaint is sometimes you get too much meat. I am a type of person who loves to taste a bit of everything so I don't want to get full after a few orders of meat. But since I've been here a few times, I just know to kindly remind the server I only want little portions of whatever I wanted to try.   I love, love, love the LA galbi, the beef brisket, and beef belly. Their pork belly is also delicious with the right amount of fat and meat. And recently I got to try the spicy pork galbi which I like as well.   Definitely will be back!",

I came here with a friend and we arrived at 1135 (5mind after their open time) and the door was still lock. No biggie. One lady saw us and came running to unlock the door. We were the first customers and were seated promptly. The lady who served us brought water and menu to us and then...she basically disappeared. We waited and waited and waited to put in our first order and she was nowhere to be found. 15mins later, she finally stopped by to take our order. Food came out instantly. We went through our first round quickly because we were so hungry and wanted to put in our next order. The lady disappeared again. She didn't come by to check on us or anything. We waited and waited. Finally I saw her running by and had to waive to get her attention. We asked for another two kinds of meat and soondubu. She brought the meats out but no soondubu. She said it will be a min. No soondubu for the next 20mins and my lady was once again nowhere to be found. Finally, she decided to come check on us and I reminded her of my soondubu. She brought it out right away. She then asked us if we wanted anything else but by the time, we were quite done with our meals and with waiting. Overall, it wasn't a very bad experience. The food was good quality but lack of taste. The service was super slow and inattentive. I gave it three stars just for the quality of meat itself, nothing else.",

All you can eat which they bring the meat to you and you grill it in front of you. It was so good. The best which I never had before was a thinly sliced pickled Daikon and you put your sliced meat in and whatever fixings wrap it and eat it. It was the best!! They didn't have lettuce to wrap our food like some Korean places do back home in Hawaii. The daikon was a great replacement.   We had the bulgogi, pork ribs, and a couple more the staff suggested. It was great and it definitely hit the spot.",

The meat quality was probably one of the best for AZ but the flavor of the marinade was not the best.  The banchan was good for Arizona but not impressive compared to banchan you might find in LA or Flushing.  The biggest issue was the service.  While our waitress seemed to be hustling, she needed help.  Rice and chigae came out way after the meat.  Burnt bbq grills were not replaced on time and the ventilation was not great.   Water was never refilled.  I hope that they figure out the waitstaff situation in the near future.",

You need to pick meats wisely though. You won't probably know which one is best unless you're familiar with each part of meat and what you like the best. Also gop chang ( intestine) and some meats were kinda tough to chew. So be sure to know what you want or bring a Korean friend who can guide you.   They will charge for left over food so it may not be a good idea to experiment a lot.  I would suggest Chadolbaegi and Woo Sam Gyup (my favorite) for a couple rounds. Those two are very soft and thin that can be eaten easily.",

We ordered 5 different meats and various stew and drinks, we paid $81 and full and happy.servers are very polite and kind. We will definitely go back w our friends.

The food has been pretty good all 3 times, I would rate the food an average of 3.5 out of 5 stars. But the reason why I gave this place 1 star is the horrible service I have received. Just in the last visit we asked our server 4 times for refills on our drinks (they were empty) she rolled her eyes every single time, we asked her for a menu to order more food 3 times, we asked for more rice and reminded our server multiple times about the rice but our server did not bring us our rice until we were going to pay. The server also yelled at my wife for asking to serve her own sesame seed oil since she was busy fixing our burner. She also threw our bill at us, etc. Just horrible service, as a former restaurant manager I have been surprised at the consistent lack of hospitality all 3 times I have visited. I wish them luck and hope they improve.",

    "text": "Great KBBQ option in AZ. The portions are huge, but you can order a half portion (I would recommend this). The meat quality is pretty good and definitely comparable to Gen BBQ. The wait time is significantly less than Gen's typical wait during dinner. Compared to Gen, the banchan selection at Manna is great and you also have better tofu soup and the option to have a steamed egg. The only complaint I have here is that the bulgogi is quite acidic and may not be what you would normally expect. We loved the Galbi though! The service is very attentive and prompt, so no need to worry about the time limit.",

The Entry is kind of awkward, as there isn't a Hostess station, nor a sign to wait to be seated.. Wasn't long though before someone came and asked us if we wanted a seat,, We said yes, but they gave us a Menu to look it over before deciding, since its ALL YOU CAN EAT..   For the price, we got the cheaper version about 21 bucks each.. NO HAPPY Hour though,,   We got Pork Belly, Baby Octopus, Beef Bulgogi, Beef Short Ribs, Spicy Pork Bulgogi and a few others,, forgot all the items,, but The Beef Bulgogi was prolly my favorite..   Wife loved, it,, they do provide various  sides, Kim Chee, Soups, etc also.. Ohh Beer 6.99 ,, ouch,, but rough week, so add that in..   Tables are nice sized, and the hotplate, is perfect temp, and after got quite messy form cooking, they swapped it out for a clean one, to start over, .. Very great Staff..   I do like they plop the first servings of meat on the hotplate for you.. but when we managing and flipping ourselves to our liking, sometimes they come right after n reflip everything and also used the scissors to chop most of the meats.. ehh, ask first if we would like some help,, .. Maybe cause I'm white, I need help on a grill.. lol,, anyways,,  Will be back,, The price was equivalent to 1 Dish at our other Korean joint, but here we got to meat out !!  Kudos..",

There were empty tables everywhere in there.  We were there at 2:30 pm in the afternoon. Almost ready to walk out.   This is the worst customer service ever. You have to ask at least 3 times for the same stuff before they will bring it to you. They don't really clean the tables and you'll see how bad the service if you eat here.   I just feel they need to add more help and also servers that speak English.  When you leave this place your entire body , hair, and clothes will smell of nasty bbq smoke.",

My friend accidentally spilled water in the electric bbq grill and they were happy to clean it all up. The staff was on top of replacing our grill plate when it got too dirty with all kinds of marinade and that was appreciated! My only complaint is, for an all-you-can-eat menu, there is a need for more vegetarian / seafood options coz I got a little tired of pork/beef.  I also think we got lucky coz it wasn't quite as crowded for a weekend.",

The service was very slow and our server just looked like she hated her job, which made the birthday dinner un-lively. We had to keep asking her for things multiple times because she didn't bring it the first time. Our water cups did not get refilled once, not even once. It was extremely hot in there and the fans above the grill did not work efficiently. The food was pretty good which is why I'm giving it at least two stars but costumer service is definitely a huge part of having a good dining experience. At the end, we asked to surprise my friend with the birthday cake and it was just frustrating that we had to ask for plates, utensils and a knife to cut the cake. After asking multiple times, she ended up bringing plastic to go forks for us to eat the cake. Last, we asked to split the checks since it was a group of 8 people and they made it like an inconvenience and we ended up putting the whole tab on one card. I don't know what restaurant you go to, that can't do split checks. There's so many other Korean BBQ restaurants I can go to, I'll never go here again.",

At least the guy said \"Hi, how many?\" or else I would of walked out. Our waiter was very nice but she got slammed with other tables so we had to start asking other waiters for help.   The meats here is quite alright. Some meats are good and some can be so chewy. Their side dishes are okay. Kimchi has a overly strong taste and the potatoes are super cold...   I really like how they have the vent above the grill so it sucks up all the smokes.   Overall, this place can be improved with their quality of meats but I wouldn't come back all the time and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",

    "text": "I'm not a super big fan a Korean bbq but enjoy it. We decided to go as a family to Manna. Count it eleven of us on a Saturday night. So we went at 5:30 without a reservation. Not a problem. We were seated fairly quickly in the back room where all the large tables are at. We got two tables and one huge one with two burners. Nice.   They have two options on the menu. A1 and A2. A1 has more selections so of course we went for A1.   One thing that I noticed is that the meats are much fresher than at Gen. Also, the meats are marinated. I thought that all the beef and chicken was really good. Fresh, marinated, and tender. Really good protein. We also got the octopus and these were not tiny but would say that they were medium sized. Really good. Just takes a little longer to cook.   Only downfall I thought was the pork. Very thick piece and just didn't seem to be marinated like the beef and chicken. So wasn't a big fan of their pork.   Our server was always on top of our tables. Asking if we wanted to order anything else and keeping our water cups filled. Even gave us a jug of water so we can refill. They also replaced our grill a few times each. Just have to ask.   The cool thing I liked is that each burner had a retractable fan. So when there's lots of smoke just put the fan closer to the burner and you don't have to breathe all that smoke. Very nice.   So I really liked this place a lot. Great food. Marinated food. Fresh food. Oh yea I didn't see any food straight from the freezer too. Great service and basically your ambiance is your burner cause all eyes are on the burner and your plate in front of you. Hahaha.   After we finished, there was a huge line out the door waiting. So I would recommend you go early if you don't like to wait. Enjoy. We did.",

The restaurant was a little small so it was full rather quickly. However, the staff does a good job turning the tables so the wait isnt nearly as bad as the other Korean BBQ restaurants in the state.  Highly recommend paying for the A1 menu so you can order the Deungshim and Goutsal along with the bulgogi and galbi. Delicious! The service was friendly, informative, and prompt. Overall, we would definitely return to Manna BBQ. We look forward to trying more items on the menu!",

It's all you can eat, so have some strategy before you start ordering.   One thing I wish I'd known before coming here was portion sizes. I assumed it would be small portions per order (like other all you can eat places) so our strategy was to start from top and order one of everything skipping the ones we know we wouldn't like. Well, so much for that plan...we started with the first four. We didn't know they give you HUGE portion of cheaper cuts and tiny portion of expensive ones. One of the cheaper cuts, beef belly arrived piled high on a dinner plate. I was already feeling full after this one dish. Galbi arrived on a long rectangular plate taking up only one side. It was FOUR small pieces! Really? So, we were only able to order few more orders before throwing in the towel.   Other than the portion sizes, I had no qualms about Manna. Service was fantastic and meats were fresh and tasty. Price is very reasonable. I'd love to go back and try other meat cuts we didn't get to last time.",

I can't really say much about the food since this more cook yourself type of restaurant. I enjoyed the fast friendly service. They always have people coming over and checking up on us for refill or to order food. I also like how they have a separate room for big parties like a birthday. The meat that comes out is always freshly prepared and displayed really nice. Their tofu and egg drop soup tastes good. I even got the little macaroon dessert! However, the only thing I can complain about is how their brisket it very bland and uneventful. And they don't have spicy bulgogi either. If you compare to Gen I say the meat quality and seasoning is better at Gen but for the price for dinner is cheaper at Manna. I wouldn't mind coming here if I was in the area.",

    "text": "Was visiting AZ from Chicago for NYE and stopped by here before my flight home with some friends.  $18 AYCE lunch special?!?! Heckkkk yessss. After not eating much real food the entire weekend, I was ready for this. Servers were nice, continuously checked on us, and brought all the meats and extras out quickly. We got soybean paste soup, tons of brisket, pork belly, and rice.  The banchan was a little bit lacking as it was only really a handful, but it was the standard kimchi, potato, bean sprouts, etc. so it was fine...and regardless....did I mention it was $18?!?!  I have no complaints aside from banchan variety and the fact that we had to ask for sesame oil, but those are small factors  Meat quality was decent although the pork belly was definitely more fatty than meaty, but...$18....1.....8.......you can't beat it.  Our AYCE in Chicago is expensive and service isn't as good, so I was surprised to find this place just via a quick Yelp search.  Thank you for feeding 4 hungry travellers well on our last few hours in AZ!!",

    "text": "Korean BBQ is one of my favorite meals, especially on days when I'm feelin' extra gluttonous. Walking out of your car to the front door of the restaurant, the heavenly smell of KBBQ gets stronger and stronger, beckoning you inside. It's basically like a siren's song. But instead of crashing your ship on rocks, you get to eat your weight in meat!   Having been to Manna in San Diego and really loving it, I wasn't quite sure what to expect walking in here. We opted for the pricier set ($28/person), because we figured we might as well go big on a Tuesday night. As mentioned in other reviews, the portion sizes are very generous--we were at one point just brought an entire rib eye steak. And it was delicious. Overall, I thought the quality of the meat was really good. However, the marinated ones were just a tad too salty for my taste, though the flavoring was excellent. That being said, I still powered through all of the Galbi and also the second order of it we got, because, well, it's Galbi.   We also got the steamed egg, which was fine but not quite as smooth as it should've been. The tofu stew was also quite salty, and seemed more like a sauce than a stew/soup. Another thing to note was that there were not many sauce options--and I'm a girl who really loves her dipping sauces. There was salt and pepper, or what I believe was their house sauce, that just tasted like sweet and slightly vinegary soy sauce. The sauce/sides options were a little bit disappointing for sure.   You can't really expect to walk out of any KBBQ place not smelling 100% like meat smoke (no major complaints here, personally), but I feel like this was particularly pungent. There are hoods at each booth, but they don't seem to be super helpful. They come down really low, so you kind of have to duck and weave to see the people across the booth, and also just are not really that effective. The whole restaurant was pretty hazy.   The service was amazing though. We were joking that it felt like we weren't eating quick enough, with how fast the employees were dropping by to toss more meat on the grill, change them out, or ask if we needed anything else.   Overall, I'd say it was an enjoyable experience and the food was good. It didn't quite live up to my San Diego memories of Manna, but I'm hoping that with some time and experience, they'll work out the kinks and get there.",

Its a friday night, so Its kinda crowded and seems like all the young kids are flocking here for some good grindz! Which is so nice to see and to tell you the truth Its so nice being amongs different ethnicities!   We probably waited no more than 10-15 min - gave me and my kane some time to talk stories while we waited!  Customer service is da bomb, everybody is so nice even through the hectic rush. Alex/Sharon and the rest of the staff are on top of it- i love coming to a restaurant where everyone helps each other out - thats how it should be!   The all you can eat is just simply amazing and tasty, Except for the baby octopus.. Lol! Couldnt acquire the taste! But, we ordered A1- which is everything and sooo cheap, only $28.00.. gosh, back home in Honolulu you'll be paying easy $50.00 for half of whst we ate... Lol  Ill be back .... loving mesa",

    "text": "When you find out that there's a 2 hour wait for a table for late lunch at Gen, Manna BBQ does sound like manna from heaven!  I do a lot of comparisons to Gen BBQ in this review. If that's what you're looking for, read on!  The menu offers a premium and basic item set. The premium \"A1\" was $28.99 and the basic \"A2\" was $21.99. We went with the A2 since it was cheaper than Gen's price of $24.99 for weekend lunch. The selection of meats for both the A1 and A2 isn't as elaborate and they don't have as many marinades as Gen but it got the job done at satisfying my unlimited grilled meat cravings for the day.   The portions seem to be larger here at Manna but the trade off was while service was still good, it wasn't as attentive as the service we received at Gen for ordering more items or for grill changes. But to be fair, they have a ton of staff at Gen vs. this smaller restaurant which only had 2 servers. Also, some the cuts of meat are thicker so it takes longer to cook. The grill seemed to heat up faster at Gen than at Manna and it also seemed easier to control the grill temperature at Gen so that your meat didn't burn (Or maybe I didn't notice any char on the grill at Gen due to the very frequent grill changes offered).   The A2 item set includes 15 different meats and 6 non-meat items such as jap chae and steamed egg. Out of the 15 we indulged in 6 of them (Bulgolgi, chadol naegi/brisket, spicy chicken, spicy samgyup sal/spicy pork belly, LA YangNyum Galbi/LA marinated beef ribs, and spicy pork galbi). Out of all the meats I'd say my favorite was probably the bulgolgi. In general while they tasted good I found the marinade sauces pretty basic and a lot of them tasted similar (The marinades were either a sweet brownish bulgolgi or galbi sauce or a spicy reddish sauce it seemed like) vs. the more unique marinated meats at Gen. You can order up to 3 items at a time and your meal comes with plenty of banchan, rice and a large salad.   The atmosphere is pleasant and there were a lot of nice booths to sit at. There was no wait at all to get seated.  Overall it was an enjoyable experience despite being our second choice for AYCE Korean BBQ and the price was slightly cheaper per person. Still.... while I liked the food and atmosphere here I'm still Jonesin' for some Gen!",

    "text": "We were having dinner with friends and decided on Korean BBQ.  For those of you who have never tried this, the meats come to you raw on a plate and there is a stainless steel plate in the middle of the table with a fire underneath to heat it.  You put the meat on and cook it at the table.  There is a vent fan above the cooking surface and you can adjust the height in case things start to get too smoky. We usually go for the for the Gold menu side rather than the black.  Our favorite choices are brisket (Chadol), Angus seasoned beef, bulgogi, spicy marinated pork belly, spicy bbq chicken.  The service is good and they are quick to bring the food to your table.  The meats are well seasoned and they give you a sweet/savory dipping sauce and seasoned salt to dip your meat in if you like.  You can also get a bowl of white rice.  They start you off with Banchan (side dishes such as kimchi, bean sprouts, potato salad).  Also included are other dishes such as steamed egg, tofu soup, scorched rice soup and zucchini and mushrooms. I suggest getting a good sear on your meat and keep an eye on it so it doesn't get too overcooked.  The thinly sliced brisket is best when cooked  to a dark brown as there is enough fat and collagen for the meat to remain tender and the extra browning provides an added dimension! Don't forget to try their ice cream filled macarons.",

The bad: the fact that the soup was the best thing we had at a Korean BBQ joint. They ran out of three things that we asked for (marinated pork, japchae and rice paper/cake) and we were there at a very reasonable 7pm. Being an all you can eat establishment, and then running out of food when that is pretty much the one expectation your guests have, is just bad business. Regarding the food itself, it was all just ok. It was borderline bland. The one thing thing that may have not been bland was the marinated pork, but they didn't have it. We opted for the more premium option, but the few premium items were just ok.   The end: maybe they had an off night but unless I go back, which I will have a hard time justifying considering Gen is just a little bit down the way, they get a solid 2 stars and really only because the service wasn't the worst thing on earth. It also wasn't amazing either, though. So yeah, based on this experience, just go to Gen. It has a funner vibe anyways. Wait will be long though.",

I didn't expect the meat to be such good quality as it's in Phoenix, but I was pleasantly surprised. $21.99 is a good price for all you can eat too, so coming from a guy who eats a lot of Korean BBQ in LA, I can say, I wholeheartedly approve of Manna BBQ!",

Our waiter Cameron was amazing with a great personality and very helpful. The food was amazing also and the staff was constantly checking on us to make sure everything was good and even changed out the grill a few times. Amazing service and experience. Definitely coming back the next time I'm in town.",

Tried beef brisket, bulgogi, Galb, baby octopus and pork belly,   All were very good.  My new favorite is the beef brisket.  Steam egg dish was very good as well.  Manna is very similar to Gen in Tempe Marketplace.  Biggest difference is the wait.  There isn't any when we went.    It does get a bit smoky in the restaurant.  So be prepared to smell like bbq when you finish.  They do have TV on the wall everywhere.  So it was nice to watch NFL football and eat BBQ meat at the same time.",

Favorites for the wife and I were the beef brisket and the ribs. The only complaint I have is the ventilation is not setup to well so It can get kind of Smokey. It won't really bother anyone except for the cook. Will be coming back to try the A-1 menu in the next week or so",

My husband is a very big meat eater and we only orders 3 times with 4-5 different dishes each time, we are all stuffed and satisfied. The tofu soup is delicious with veggie and seafood as well. There is no waiting even we go at 7pm on Saturday. And also there is no limit number of meat that you can order a time as well. Definitely will come back for more!!! Highly recommend!!!",

The meat is very good quality and you can definitely taste the difference. The servers are always asking if you want more or if they can help which is DOPE ON A ROPE TIMES TWO. I truly believe the price justified the quality and taste of the food. They have this ponzu sauce...and OMG...it's heavenly with the meat. And the atmosphere is A-1. In addition, the bathroom is poppin' with that blastin' music...it was like a night club in there bro. Hashtag I would definitely go back for the food, service, and the bathroom.",

    "text": "We now have 2 great korean bbq places in Phoenix: Gen BBQ and now.....MANNA BBQ!  This all you can eat korean joint originated from San Diego, and it tastes JUST like it's predecessor! The concept is the same as it's competitor Gen bbq, you have a list of meats and other sides to order from, and you try to stuff yourself to the brim!  There ARE some differences between Manna and Gen bbq, that I feel people should be aware of, and it COULD make up your mind on which one to go to. Here are some differences that I've noticed so far  PRICE Yes, Manna is a tad bit more expensive. I believe it's $18 for lunch and $28 for dinner versus Gen which is $17 and $25.   SIDE DISHES (ban chan) Manna bbq gives WAY better side dishes, and yes, they have fish cakes!!!!   MEAT QUALITY Manna has better meat quality! The bulgogi is SOOOO good here and it's not cut up into weird slivers like at Gen. The brisket (cha dol) is better too here, it just tastes more flavorful!   SELECTION Gen definitely wins this! They have a HUGE selection to choose from, including Seafood! For me, I don't care about the Seafood options, but gen also provides things like korean fried chicken, and cheese pork cutlet! However Manna serves things like steamed egg and soondoobu that tastes wayyy better than Gen.   SERVICE Because Manna is less popular than Gen, their service is better. There is none of that \"only can order 4 things at a time\" rule, or they don't say anything about 2 hour maximum time limit which is nice. It DID take awhile for them to switch our grill out, but then afterwards they started to do it every so frequently.   So all in all, Manna is different from Gen, as for which one is the best,  I haven't decided yet.   Tips -Ask for garlic and onions to grill. It'll add to the meal and flavor your meats  -don't be afraid to ask for refills on your side dishes, the fish cakes, they'll be more than happy to get you more  -ask for another pair of tongs, I think it's weird when there's only one person grilling the meats",

It's a great side dish to have with all of your pan chan). I loved that it had that \"family owned\" restaurant feel. The music wasn't too loud like other places I've gone to, so you can actually hear what your dinner guests are saying and the tables were very large and open. We got sat down right away which was amazing, we've been to other places where you're waiting over 2 hours to sit down and by that point you're already ready to go somewhere else. The staff was all extremely friendly and attentive as well! :) we will absolutely be coming back and will recommend this place to all of our friends and family!",

Sadly my first experience at Manna will undoubtedly be my last as it was brought down by customer service that made me feel unwelcome and disrespected.   Like some of the other reviewers have mentioned, simple requests for a water refill were flat out ignored. This happened more than once, and was so bad I had to get up and fill my own drink and grab myself some fresh napkins. It was almost as if the staff didn't care about us and prioritized other tables; bad service feels even worse when you are looking at the table next door getting good service. We had someone take our initial order and fail to put it in. Than two new servers took our initial order while the table next door was already being served. The only time they came to check on us was to schmooze before we decided on the tip which felt disingenuous.  It's a shame because I did enjoy the food. The banchans were on point with a delicious fish cake formed in to what looked like a thick noodle. Quick pickles and pickled radish were also refreshing, the acidic flavor paired great with the meat. The various ribs and brisket we ordered were served in generous portions. No issues with freshness and quality was on par with the competition.  4.5 /5 food 1/ 5 service ---------------- 2 overall",

    "text": "Unless someone told you specifically where this place was, there really is no way you would even know this place existed. It's extremely tucked away in the corner of an empty plaza (You'll smell it before you see it) - but thank the lord no one knows about this place yet. Like others who have posted below, let them wait 2-4 hours at nearby Gen. This place is a silent weapon, just waiting to explode with ridiculous wait times when others learn about this place.   Don't get me wrong, Gen is great, maybe even more superb to this place (especially the marinade and service) - but in terms of quelling the AYCE hunger, this place really does the trick without wasting precious time. I used to go to Cali or Vegas just to get AYCE in this barren desert and now they're suddenly popping up all over the place - it's mind-blowing! Here are some recommendations:  - It is extremely smoky in here. When I got here, the owner had the doors open to blow out the smoke. Their hoods aren't doing a great job so be prepared if you get teary eyed easily. Hopefully, they fix this soon.  - Get the A2 vs the A1. It's cheaper and honestly, has the meats most people want in an AYCE anyways. No point in paying more for - otherwise, I would recommend you go to Gen where they have the same options as A1 but cheaper.   - Some portions are big, for a purpose. They tend to load up on the cheaper, fattier cuts like the bellies or brisket, to the point where it's almost 2-3x the portions of anywhere else. Actual meatier cuts like galbi and bulgogi are normal portions so you don't waste the good stuff. When ordering brisket or belly, ask for a half order or risk regret at trying to stuff yourself with filler fatty cuts.  - They have an actual private room in the back so if you have a large party, this would be a great place - a benefit over Gen.  - Service is currently still working out kinks, so you have to practice patience with this one for now.  - If you've got elderly in your party, I honestly probably think this place is a better option over Gen. Not as crowded, noisy, dark, with chairs they can actually sit and relax in. Just a different vibe is all.",

If you've gone to Gen at Tempe Marketplace, you've waited about 2.5 hours to 3 hours to get seated, not this place. It's hidden in a plaza in the corner which used to be a great childhood Chinese restaurant that we used to come to!   Now for the price, there are two different menus to choose from. A1 and A2. A1 is $28.99 and A2 is 21.99. We went with the A2 since it had most of our favorite meats.   The meats are very good cuts. The portions are a lot bigger than Gen so because of how much you order at a time, they aren't skimpy at all. They also have the steam egg which is one of my favorites!! The downfall is that they do not have rice paper.  Overall the staff was wonderful, we met the owner who was really nice and called out whenever the tables around him needed a grill change.   The concept is very similar to Gen, the options on the menu are less than what Gen offers but overall I would say meat quality is better here.",

I have to say the quality of meat is always the same & love the fact they have big & small intestine on the menu. Was not a fan of it but it is sooooo delicious. The filling is full & with great flavor. Miso soup & steam egg also is great. Not too salty or bland. Service could be better (staff don't smile as much) & not very welcoming when you walk in but it's defunitely worth coming back for the food, especially with all the bbq places opening up, by far my #1 choice.",

The bulgogi was good. Short rib sliced steak and brisket was the best. Service was ok.   The bad part of the meal was the hood had to be lowered almost 5\" above the grill to suck up all the smoke. The knob to adjust the flame was by my crotch where I was sitting, so it felt like the waitress was reaching to grab my crotch throughout the night.!? She would say excuse me or anything just reached in there. My wife got made and had to sit closer to me and told the waitress to back off!!  But the real kicker was $2.50 for a can of no name iced tea and no refills!!!!",

Beef tongue and brisket are definitely juicier than Gen.  The sliced rib meat  (2nd on the menu) is tender yummy.  We made reservations with no hassle and service was fantastic for a group of 12. ***  3rd all you can eat kbbq to open in East valley this year!  Great quality meat with no wait (for now at least).  Only been open a week but imagine it will get busier later especially after the new giant Asian market opens next door!  This place is bright and clean and has individual adjustable pull down vents so you're not smoked out while cooking.  Staff was super attentive and meat came out fast.  Choose from $21.99 for basics or $28.99 for premium with steak and beef tongue. The beef deckle here is juicy and great quality.  Pork belly was not impressive but will try again to see if it was a one-off.  Kalbi decent and included in $21.99 set!  They also have deliciously thin radish wrap but no rice paper. This is definitely a go-to if I am craving kbbq and don't want to wait 2 hours at Gen.  Reservations too!",

Last time we came over total three of us, and one of my friend ate already, asked if she can just have the veg salad that is on side served before dish came. Also we told them twice she is not going to refill. The portion of the salad probably only contain the edges of the leaves and countable. So the manger told us the side was free and yes she can eat the salad only and charge for two person. So this time here we are again, but one of our friend don't feel like eating bbq today so we ask if we are allowed to do what we did last time cause we thought it was still important to clarify with them  that the previous time when we were here we've been told that the salad on side was free, so I can eat that only.  This time the different female manger told us that if I'm a vegetarian that I have to pay half of the price for the veg menu. She continuously trying to convince us that is a vegetarian price, but the original point was asking if she can only eat the salad but nothing else with no refill. We've been told different charge functions of this restaurant, and it is a shame that the female manger doesn't know how to communicate with us, and only concentrate on how to make money instead of having human connection towards to customers. Just a heads up for who will be having mana that make sure to clearly your check before you pay for what you didn't had.",

Some items were definitely on the blander side [the octopus] but other items were all about flavor. The portions here are ridiculously crazy on the thinner items like brisket and beef tongue which I don't mind one bit. I recommend coming in a group of at least four to get the most variety of items because with bigger portions, it's harder to sample everything they have to offer.  The quality was a lot better than I expected.  You could see the beautiful marbling on some of their cuts and it made me straight have heart eyes, emoji style.  Get the brisket, the beef tongue, the LA YangNyum Galbi, and the shrimp!  The banchan here could use some work.  4.5 stars easily but the service at Gen is much more efficient and I do like the bigger selection at Gen so for that, they'll be rounded down instead of up.  Regardless, if I wasn't willing to wait for two hours at Gen, I wouldn't be mad about coming to Manna instead!  \"Meat is murder - tasty, tasty murder.\"",

And I have tried all the Korean BBQ places in the Tempe/Mesa/Chandler area.  It is a little pricier than most, but worth the modest extra.   It was so good it reminded of my many visits to Seoul. After lunch I expected to walk out the door and be on one of the quaint little side streets in Seoul.   I will return.",

Otherwise the wait maybe long.   Food: AYCE KBBQ in 2 hour time limit. Everything was really good overall. My friends and I decided to order to A2 which contains the shorter list of items for ~$22/person. The flavors are pretty good. I love their tofu soup. It's the perfect spiciness for me. I did think their marinated meat were slightly a bit on the salty side for me. But still very good. I would definitely come back again.",

    "text": "Korean BBQ is taking over Phoenix, and I, for one, welcome the food coma.  KBBQ is a monthly (at least) tradition among my friends and I (shouts out to fellow Yelpers Mike Y. and Cher-Yee L!!), and Manna has become our destination of choice. The quality of the meat is decent, the service is quick, and the price is reasonable. However, it is somewhat cramped inside and the wait can definitely build up if you're going during prime lunch/dinner rush, especially on a weekend. Of course, that's just a testament to the quality of the restaurant!  If you want the full experience, go for the premium menu and work your way down the list, ordering three at a time. If you're really adventurous, you might give the octopus or intestine a shot, though I thought the latter was tasteless and personally couldn't handle the texture and juices. I thought the LA galbi, spicy pork galbi, beef tongue, and brisket were definitely worth a few more rounds. As usual, there are veggie side dishes like kimchi and spicy cucumber already on the table, but I'd also give the jap chae noodles and the steamed eggs a try.  When you're ready to throw in the towel here, check out the boba tea place just past Lee Lee's, and of course, be sure to cancel all your plans after.",

    "text": "I decided to come try this place since I went to Gen so many times already. We went with the A2 to see how the basic selection would fare, and from what I had, it is satisfactory. Mainly, the important item that was available was galbi short ribs. At Gen, you cannot get the galbi short ribs unless it was during dinner time. At Manna, you can get it for the A2 tier of $21.99 although you do miss the variety of meat items even compared to the lunch menu at Gen like Hawaiian Steak.  When I say basic, you really do get the basic of items in A2 from a few beef items to a few pork items to a few chicken items to a few seafood items. It's not necessarily bad unless you are looking for jowl or something fancy at Manna.  The service wasn't terrible either (not as good as Gen) since we never got a our water, and we had to manually request a grill change but... whatever. The atmosphere is more of a restaurant compared to Gen's nightclub decor.  When it comes to side dishes, Manna beats out Gen with seaweed. I love seawood. And Manna serves steamed egg. Seriously... why doesn't Gen serve steamed egg??? Manna also have non-marinaded octopus (non-spicy) too!  ***************************************************************************  I would recommend Manna based on certain \"if-then\" conditions...  1. If you are looking to go cheap at $15.99 with steak and jowl and a TOTAL OF 31 ITEMS, then go to Gen during lunch times.  2. If you are looking to go cheap and MUST EAT seaweed, beef galbi, and steamed egg, then go to Manna for the A2 20 item menu at $21.99.  3. If you are looking to spend $24.99 for the full 37 item menu and don't care about seaweed and steamed egg, then go to Gen for dinner.  4. If you just want the full 27 item menu with seaweed and steamed egg for $28.99, then go to Manna for their A1 tier.  Of course, neither is really better than the other. There are some items on Gen's full menu that's not on Manna's menu, so pick your restaurant based on what you want to eat and the price point you want to pay!",

    "text": "Oh so happy that I decided to check this place out! We are obsessed with Korean bbq and so glad that there are a few options to pick from in the valley.   We arrived on Saturday around 1pm and the place was starting to get busy. We were a party of 7 so they had to do some arranging before we could sit down. We waited about 10 minutes and finally the hostess came around and took us to the back.   We were seated, taken our drink orders, and were brought out a salad right away. Sodas come in cans and each soda is $1.99. Oh and no refills. We all decided to go the A2 option ($21.99) instead of the premium option. ($28.99)  The meats we had were that of: Spicy pork belly: spicy but delicious! Great taste Spicy chicken: the chicken was very chewy and was our least favorite  Bulgogi: very good! LA Galbi: delicious cuts of meat! The marinade was great! Beef brisket: waitresses recommendation and didn't disappoint!   Steamed egg: too watered down and had no flavor, boo :(  Meats were brought out in doubles so each side of our table always had meat which was so convenient. The waitress was very attentive and always made sure our drinks were filled.   We were stuffed at the end and we were there about an hour and a half. There is a two hour time limit but that's more then enough time to finish.   Our total came out to be $175 for a party of 7.   I will definitely be back as everything was good.",

My last experience I was with my mother, son and niece. Again, service was trash. My mom had asked for napkins and utensils and it took them FOREVER to bring it. My boyfriend (at the time) who happens to be Korean showed up and only then is when they were attentive to our table. If it hadn't been for him we probably still would've been waiting. I don't know if it's a language barrier or what? But the service sucked. My previous experience I was with my best friend who is Korean, and even then the service was trash. I'd much rather go to Hodori which is directly across the street. Service at Hodori is 100 times better and food is way better and already cooked for your enjoyment. I won't be returning here, I've been here 3 times and service hasn't changed.",

    "text": "Very very dissappointed. We actually detoured from visiting a competitor in Tempe because Manna had a 1/2 Star advantage. Folks also frequently cited Manna's freshness over the Tempe competition. Again, to my extreme disappointment, freshness was NOT featured in our visit to Manna.  We ordered from the A1 Premium Menu.   OK, so what was good? The Banchan was very fresh and tasty. The Bulgogi was good, sliced surprisingly thin, but good. Had I just stayed with the Banchan, Bulgogi, and Spicy Pork Galbi it would have been a pretty good visit.  But dear God, everything else was off. The Chicken tasted off and its texture indicated it was far past its acceptable shelflife. The ribeye was barely passable. I could go on about the other items. But really all you have to know is the shrimp was crumbly and disgusting.  When I got home I looked this stuff up. Good, raw shrimp bodies should be firm and translucent. Shrimp should still be attached to the shell; if the shrimp's body has detached from the shell or has fallen apart within the shell, it's likely bad. Cooked shrimp meat should have a firm, white interior with a hint of pink on the exterior; don't purchase or eat mushy cooked shrimp. The eyes should be glossy and moist; if they are missing or shrunken, the shrimp may not be fresh. Raw shrimp heads should be firmly attached to the bodies, and you should have to use a firm pinch to remove the heads from cooked shrimp.  Yeah, big fail in all categories there. Check the crumbly shrimp pictures.  Got my $80 lesson. Learn from me.",

Needless to say, this ones been around the block and PHX is just one of the few places this popular eatery has touchdown on!  Manna BBQ offers up 2 different prices points regarding how you want to order.  You have a choice of $28.99 or $21.99 and of course allotment of meats.  We settled for the $21.99 price since I feel sometimes that after eating for certain amounts of time; all the meat tend to taste the same.    We started with your basic bulgogi meat and spicy meats along with some briskets.  I am happy to announce that the marinated meats and spice hit the spot.  I didn't even use my sauce for much.  Sweet, salty, and spicy with every bite, Manna definitely has their time of marination down.  Though I wasn't too impress with the brisket since it was pretty plain, but that's expected.  However, the sauce they serve on the side was pretty simple.  It was soy sauce and rice vinegar base with some sea salt...yah!  I guess that would be my complaint about the food; need some flare with the side sauce!  Also, the side appetizer dishes was a hit or miss; what ever happen to the fried mackerels!?  Anyways, that's not much  to complain about, but the sesame noodles and kimchi was a hit; I could do without the rest.  In the end, Manna BBQ did deliver some excellent Korean BBQ bites.  Service was fast; every time we ordered they came right out without wait.  The place was well ventilated, but I could definitely do with more lighting since that would have helped with the pictures plus allowing me to see how I'm cooking. - Enjoy!",

I was also so upset, I asked one of the waiters for a drink and got straight up IGNORED.  Please don't come to this restaurant I am trying to save you from a horrible experience. They had a call button at it literally took them 33 minutes to respond to that when I was in a hurry. This was the first time EVER that I had to give a 0% tip.  They also never told you how long to cook anything either.  I would expect service to be a lot better since they weren't even cooking the food.  Please never eat here, I am doing all of you guys a HUGE favor for warning you guys about this.",

    "text": "Okay. My fiance and I, huge fans of Gen, decided to come here and check it out. Long story short: just go to Gen. Anyways...  We got the A1 menu ($27.99) because my fiance just cannot go without beef tongue, and I love me some rib meat. I wasn't a fan that I had to pay $6 more to have access to the full menu, but to each their own.  The meat was fine. The brisket was definitely better than Gen (I usually don't enjoy the sliced meats), but that was about it. The rib meat was just, so bad. Tasted like it had been soaked in sesame oil, which I'm personally not a fan of (if you can't get enough of sesame oil, you'll probably love it). This was disappointing, since the rib meat at Gen is my favorite. It was also a bit tough. The galbi was alright, but not as tasty as Gen.  Also, the food portions are 2-3x bigger than the portions at Gen, which was not ideal for us, personally. We like to order a lot of different things, but after 4 plates at Manna, we were full. So much on the menu that we didn't get to try.  As for atmosphere, the restaurant looks boring inside, as opposed to Gen, which looks sleek and hip, with a giant TV wall. I have to say that the service at Manna was great, though, and the food was served quickly.  I feel bad putting this place up against Gen, but it's just so hard not to given the proximity. If you're trying to choose a Korean BBQ, do yourself a favor and go to Gen.",

Surprise! Surprise!  Meat quality was very very good and the portion was also very generous!  My family loves KBBQ and we will go the distance to get it.  Manna BBQ really delivered!  We enjoyed very much our dinner!  Service was promote and attentive!  Price is very reasonable.    This place is not very big and as new as it is, opened about two months, there was already  waiting time, about 20-30 minutes.  Just wait till next door opens this giant Korean grocery store, Asiana, in Nov.  I think the wait time could be longer!!!  They don't take reservations.  One little tip, the sitting arrangement cannot accommodate group over 6.  We will definitely come back again SOON!",

Better than Gen BBQ or the others - the meat quality is way better and the side dishes are good too! All for $21.99 or $27.99 (for the premium meats).  One more thing - they have the vents that go directly above the grill so the place doesn't get smoky and you won't come out smelling like meat!",

First off there was really no wait which was nice. The staff were kind of all over the place. The cuts of meat were not as good as they are in CA. However they were definitely flavorful.   Overall good experience and we'd probably give this place another try when we go back. It seems like they're relatively new so they might be ironing out all the kinks.",

Quality meats quickly provided in large quantities for an affordable price--how can you beat that?? Come with an appetite! My favorites are the Geutsal (boneless short rib) and the Chadol Baegi (black angus beef brisket). That's on their more premium menu for $28.99 a person.  Make sure you ask for the sesame oil to dip your meats, it goes perfectly with these. If you're a vegetarian, like my wife they charge you less ($11) for whatever veggie dishes you want, which was a nice perk. Her faves were the Soondubu (tofu stew) and the Japchae (glass noodles). Service was great. You can order three meats at a time for the table. The waiters were very attentive and quick to  take additional orders. We didn't even realize there was a button to press to call them back because we never needed it. Have already taken friends back and will continue to do so! Five stars for the best bang for your buck AYCE in town.",

It's awesome if you can get seated.  It's a hit or miss if you go later than 8PM.  I know they're fairly new but they should have this stuff sorted out by now and really honor their posted hours.

When I first came in I was made to wait several minutes before anybody even greeted me, not because they were busy mind you there was only two other customers  at the time but the two waitresses and the whole staff were all in the back room.  This place is higher in price than all other all-you-can-eat places. Was told the reason was for higher-quality  cuts of beef, and that would be understandable, however when I ordered, I found that they limit the cut to just one per person! I found a lot of things missing or they had ran out of. For instance, when I asked for glass noodles the answer was \"she hasn't made any today.\" When I asked for veggies but asked to hold the onions I was told onions and zucchini was the only veggies they had despite showing six or more on the menu. ( remember the whole reason you are paying more supposedly is because of the bigger number of choices, LOL). I was also put off by the fact that they only sell canned soda for $2 ,they do not have any Fountain drinks.  Lastly the bathroom was horrible, they supposedly sent someone to clean it before I will use it and it seems like all they did was run a wet mop literally over everything the toilet was dripping wet when I went to use the facility.",

Once this place opened and my brother insisted of trying it, I went along with for lunch and I'll be honest, it's very good! Walking in, the atmosphere is nice and clean. If anyone has been to the California location in San Marcos,this is the same one! With the banchan being typical, they have cilantro and onions in a sweet, sour and spicy sauce that was amazing. The meat quality here is great, and I will have to say, almost better. Thick cut galbi and a 12oz steak was amazing. It was tender and full of flavor. They also have unlimited steamed egg so that's basically life right there. The brisket portion was huge, like I'm talkin you can feed 6 people with that. The portions here are plentiful. With 2 people coming in ready to eat I was overwhelmed with the thick cut, and large proportioned meat. This is probably gonna be my next visited kbbq spot once I get back from my hiatus of kbbq. The owner is a friendly guy and I talked to working with him in the future. The service not to mention was also very friendly. I'm glad to once again put aside my korean bbq overload to try this place.",

Yeah...that was NOTHING similar to rice paper.  For one, it was pickled and another it's crunchy! That's a game changer for me.  The food was flavorless.  They ran out of a bunch of food which is annoying considering you're paying for AYCE but in this case it was AYCE when it's available.  I remember going to Manna back when we were in California and it was pretty good....here in Arizona it definitely isn't the same.  The seats and tables were sticky.  They stack their sauces on top of each other which I think is unsanitary as the bottom of the dish is now touching the sauce that I will be dipping my food into.  I just didn't feel clean being in there.  I'm sorry, Manna...I really wanted to like you because we need AYCE KBBQ here, but this one is off my list.",

    "text": "Korean BBQ isn't at the top of my list. But, their menu looked really interesting. I don't really enjoy paying to then do all of the cooking.  That said, Manna does a really good job. The place is clean, including the restroom. The people are friendly.   The A1 menu is the way to go. I mean really. It's only a few $ more and you get the better cuts of meat. The portions are generous. And, even thought the \"all you can eat\" is limited to dine in (no taking leftovers without paying more) and for no longer than 2 hours, you'll get good value.  The rib eye is really good and easy to cook. The beef short ribs had great flavor. The spicy pork ribs weren't really spicy. They were good but hard to cook. The beef bulgogi had a wonderful flavor. I didn't like the brisket because it was about 50% fat. It's cut as thin as thin-sliced bacon. The shrimp were hard to deal with and too much work for the size. The egg was straight up weird and tasted like what air would taste like if it were an egg. For my taste, all of the meats except the rib eye had excessive amounts of fat still attached.  Refill service was lacking. The \"hot\" tea was more like \"warm\" tea. They had a sign upon entry advising they were out of the large intestine. Oh darn. I nearly turned on my heels. Kidding! The menus have items lined out rather than reprinting them - makes me think \"this place is authentic.\" Why waste perfectly good printed menus, right?  If you're into this kind of dining, I believe you'll be very happy with your experience here.",

    "text": "Korean BBQ spots are popping up all over the valley and I'm all about sampling the goods to find which ones work. The location is probably the best thing for me as it's conveniently located for dinner or lunch with my coworkers. If you do have to deal with a wait, you can slide over next door to the market to look around and pick up a few things.   The selection of food has some variations towards some of the other spots and the menu is broken down into 2 price categories (A1 Premium which is around $29/person & the A2 @ $21/person). I have to admit that I struggle to pronounce a lot of things so I pointed out which numbers I wanted on the menu to make sure. When the food came out, we all were looking trying to figure out what it was as it didn't match our order. My kiddos were hungry and said whatever... When we were ready to order again, the 1st thing requested was Shrimp and that's when I realized someone \"assumed\" the wrong thing. That's probably where the low star rating comes... service... Granted their were plenty of people that night, but while I was pointing to the menu, our server just assumed we were ordering from the lower priced menu. She was quick to point it out and I was even quicker to give her \"AND YOUR POINT IS WHAT\" response and look. We like baby octopus, we like shrimp, we like Goutal... hence why I pointed to that list. When the shrimp and the other items we requested came out, we go a double order for the stuff we initially ordered.. Not sure how we were gonna good it all but we figured it out.   After that, everything went pretty smooth for the night and then we wrapped up. The place has another room in the rear with 2 TV's and is excellent for groups and celebrations. Each time I've gone I've been in that back area. If you're big on soft drinks you will only get a can as it's not all you can drink beverages... I typically drink water but wanted a  sprite or coke on standby over the rocks at some point.",

We usually order the brisket and beef belly. The japchae and soon du bu is a must when we come here as well!  However, BEWARE of the wait. One time we came on a Saturday evening and the wait was an hour and a half. I believe they start getting busy around 7pm since we came here on a Friday evening at 6pm and didn't wait for a table. When we were leaving there was a wait and a lot of people in their waiting area.  MANNA ALL THE WAY!!!",

    "text": "Tonight, my husband and I decided to try out Korean BBQ for the first time, so we visited Manna BBQ. We both had the same assessment: a lot of work that really wasn't worth it. But hey, we tried something new.   First of all, you should not eat Korean BBQ if you are pregnant or have a compromised immune system (seriously). There are some extremely unsanitary practices that are bound to happen in this type of set-up. For example, since we had never eaten Korean BBQ before, we decided to try out the all-you-can-eat option, so we could sample a lot of different meat. One of the things we tried was the shrimp. The dish came to the table and all the shrimp still had their heads attached. Because we were virgins, our server took pity on us, and tried to help us out. For sanitary purposes, we had been waiting to cut the meat up with the table scissors until after the meat was fully cooked. Our server didn't seem to be aware of safe meat handling practices because she proceeded to take the scissors and cut all the heads off the shrimp when they were still raw. She then took our cooked meat off the cooker and cut it up, using the same scissors she cut the raw shrimp with. I thought my husband was going to turn green. It should also be noted that the shrimp is definitely a meat to avoid here. It was very poor quality. It was soft to the touch (not firm) and it was impossible to peel the shell off the shrimp, causing most of the meat to be wasted.  Another unpleasant sight was when our cook top was charred, they came to swap it out. Underneath the cooking surface was at least five inches of grease; it was pretty gross. We both guessed the grease was not cleaned out on a nightly basis.  Additionally, my husband complained that his side of the table wasn't clean. It was covered in some kind of sticky substance and he ended up with some kind of gunk on his arm.   Both my husband and I had a hard time telling the difference between all the red meats because they were so heavily seasoned. My husband did like the pork belly, but I didn't think it was anything special. I would not order the baby octopus. It's not that the octopus was bad, it's just that it was too difficult to figure out how long to cook it for. Which brings me to my next issue: YOU are the cook. If you do not know how to properly cook meat at home, you're going to waste a lot of money screwing up meat here. It's easy to under and/or over-cook the meat, if you are inexperienced or just a bad cook.   This is also a terrible place for a first date. The cooktop exhaust fans that are at each table are loud, the tables are wide, and you really have to pay attention to cooking the meat, so it's hard to relax and have an involved conversation. I also would not bring a child under 8 here; they could easily burn a finger on the cooktop, if they aren't constantly monitored.  Each order comes with salad and rice, along with six sides: kimchi, pickles, pickled radishes, fish cakes, bean sprouts and \"sweet\" mashed potatoes. The kimchi, pickles, and pickled radishes are delicious and I hate radishes! The fish cakes are also excellent. The mashed potatoes are good if you eat them with the meat. They are sweet because they add corn to them, which is a nice contrast to the salty meat.  We both thought the service was great! Our server was very attentive, kind, and helpful. Our table was constantly bussed and the hostess was very sweet. She got us a few things we needed, when our server wasn't available.  Two final notes: you cannot take home leftovers and they do not accept Discover.  In the end, we both decided we would not be returning, but it's really not because we had a bad experience. I think it's just because we aren't Korean BBQ people.",

For a little more could have gone to a teppenyaki place, had a show as someone else comes and better food. The meats were average at best. Tried steak, chicken, shrimp and veggies, all sub par. I think the only reason people go is the all you can eat pricing. So, everyone we saw was gorging on meat that I could cook better and have better quality at home. If you want a lot of meat that you cook yourself and don't want to stay home, you found your place. If you want good meat, someone to cook for you, head someone else.",

We asked why it is even allowing us to join the wait list if last call is 9pm. We didn't really get any response but a repetitive you can come but last call is 9. So basically we can come but can't eat. What's the point of listing your hours like that to deceive hungry people? Going to the other Korean bbq that's open later. Either useless hostess or staff and if this was my business I would never allow this and let a customer come eat instead of repetitively stating last call is 9 but you can drive all the way here for nothing",

We have a party of  11 people so we used two table right next to each other. We ordered the premium which cost 27.99 apiece. The quality of the meats here were very delicious as in LA , but the choices also limited. I loved KBBQ a lot , but maybe this restaurant was new , therefore I hope it will add more selection next time. The services here were outstanding , quick and friendly that what I liked . I hope they will have better and more seafood selections whenever I come back next visit.",

Meat is fresh and good. I prefer their marinated galbi.   Also, No long wait for a table Vs. Gen BBQ!!! Kind of hidden location next to the supermarket.   Been here 2 times already.  Pretty consistent with service and quality of food.  I do recommend coming in a group of at least 4, as always a bigger group means you will be able to try all or most of the meats, and you will be able to finish the meats, so you don't get charge for over ordering.  Food: good selection of meats for kbbq. Has all your basic types. Galbi, bulgogi, LA galbi*, beef tongue*, brisket*.  * = i like Get tongs for everyone to use and cook. Make sure to control the temp as you cook.   yes to: Japchae, steam egg, and salad for fiber  Service: Friendly and pretty fast. tip: Use the wall button to get flag down a waiter or waitress   Parking: nice big plaza outside the supermarket plaza  Come check this place out.",

Alright, if you're still reading, Manna's got the best quality meat--you can see how marbled the meat is in their cuts, and you can definitely taste the flavor. If they only had beef belly and brisket I'd be completely fine--that's how good it is. Their sides are better than the other places, not only in taste but also selection--they have fried egg!   The restaurant is a little small, and they're usually pretty busy, but if you've got a group of 6 or more you can call ahead and make a reservation! Otherwise you'll just be waiting for your name to be called.   The service is solid here--they let you choose 3 meats at a time, and they're pretty lenient if you wanna choose 1 or 2 more.   You can't go wrong with Manna.",

I came here with a group of 8, and there was plenty of food to go around! If this is your first time trying Korean BBQ, I suggest starting with the classics: bulgogi beef, galbi, brisket, and pork belly.  The quality of food here is better than most Korean BBQ locations around the valley, and the service was great! They offered suggestions on things to get when we didn't know what we wanted, which is a plus.

It's all you can eat with set price, you get charged extra for crazy left overs so make sure you order what you can eat! Chadol is my all time favorite, but everything looked amazing. Had the potstickers for an appetizer and they were great too. It's part of the Asiana plaza so check it out!",

    "text": "This trip to Manna BBQ features a group of 8 friends, 6 who had never had KBBQ prior. Once everyone got there we were hanging out in the back room. Some of the uninitiated were voicing confusion about what to order. After assuring them that they would have a good time we grabbed some brisket, bulgogi beef and pork belly for both halves of the table.   Once the group understood the process, the night was a blast. The Bulgogi beef and chicken were crowd favorites and everyone was eager to cook meat for themselves.   The quality of the meat seemed very fresh! Now, I'm not an expert on meat, but it looked, tasted, and smelled great. My tip for the brisket is to be generous with the meat sauce. Since the cuts aren't marinated the result can be a little dry. But a quick dip in the sauce remedies this.   For the dinner price, everyone left feeling full. Our group went through two rounds of finishing everything in addition to some cups of rice before throwing in the towel. I would definitely come here again with more friends since the tables can handle 4 individuals.   Lastly, the friends who had never tried KBBQ before wanted me to mention that they also recommend this place. Their enthusiasm was explosive.",

She also kept repeatly ignoring our table and walking away when we were trying to order more. Not only that when she she was setting food for our table, she dumped all three of the plates of bulgogi on the grill. I don't mind that she tried to be nice by putting our food on there, but it didn't allow any other meat to be on the grill. We had intestines and pork belly and those usually cook longer. Also because she dumped all of it in, it left some juices and when we put our other meat in it tasted like bulgogi. Our waitress also kept dismissing us when we politely called her over. However despite the bad service the food was absolutely delicious. The meat were so tender and soft, it just melted in my mouth. Their green tea was also spectacular!  I love how everything tasted I just wish the service was a little better. I might come back just for the food! Overall the service is lacking but the food is super yummy and I would come again.",

I think if they had been more timely on getting the food out they could have turned their tables over faster. It took about 15 to 20 minutes for us to get our check, for example. We were there on a Saturday night so being busy was understandable but I would expect that they would want to get us out as soon as possible in order to seat someone else at the table.  They offer a option A and option B to their menu. Option A has more items available than Option B. Not everything on the menu was good. The basics were good like the bulgogi and kalbi. The sirloin was tough. They have a nice table setup with the exhaust fans. The kimchi selection was great. Soda is by the can and not from a fountain dispenser.",

Being from Dallas, we are spoiled with multiple joints and we were hesitant to try a KBBQ place in Phoenix as there were only about... 3, 2 of them being AYCE. However, we gave it a shot and I'm glad we did.  The menu selection was broad and we were very happy with everything we chose. I recommend starting out with the non marinated items (brisket, beef belly, pork belly) and then ease in the marinated meats. Our favorite was the Galbi. Although they do have short rib, they are deboned so we were sad about that. But everything was marinated well and the dipping sauces & banchan were yummy! I also recommend getting the steamed egg, tofu soup, and corn cheese. Don't forget to ask for garlic and peppers to flavor your meat!   The ventilation and grills here were great! Unlike the Manna here in DFW, the air vent was the one where you pull down closer to the grill. Our food also cooked very fast and the servers were quick to adjust the heat/change the grill whenever necessary.  Overall, the experience was wonderful and it was nice that there is a Tours next door for some dessert.",

We were able to get two tables that seat 8 right next to each other, located in their back room. Each table had 2 grills. It may have been the location we were in (because the booths in the dining room were much larger) but the space was VERY tight. This is especially difficult when you are trying to cook and share food.   We ordered a bunch of different meats and the brisket was my favorite. Our grill kept burning and it would take a while to get them to replace it. The issue was, being in the back room with a burning grill, the ventilation was awful! I ended up coughing a bit and leaving my group earlier than planned due to not being able to handle the smoke.   Overall, the food was decent and the rest of the service was pretty quick (except for when I asked for my check).",

The bad was mostly service related. My friend had never had Korean BBQ before and therefore tried some meats she didn't like. I didn't like those either, so they went uneaten. The restaurant wanted to charge us for any excess meat we didn't consume..... I feel like this goes against the point of an all you can eat restaurant, which, to me, is to be able to try new things without the risk of cost. I also feel that the portions of meat they brought out were huge, and, if they wanted to reduce waste, they should offer smaller tasting portions. Anyway, it wasn't terrible if you know what you're getting into, but it was a bit of a frustrating experience for us.",

    "text": "I looooove all you can eat Korean BBQ, especially the sluggishness you feel when the meal is over, you've consumed 10 pounds of meat, and the meat sweats begin. That's how you know you did it right.   FOOD: Manna did not disappoint! All the meat was super flavorful. For extra seasoning, they serve salt and pepper, some type of sauce that pairs well with meat, and chili paste (you have to ask for this if you want something spicy). My personal favorite meats were the bulgogi, chadol (beef brisket), and of course the pork belly. If you're on the adventurous side, I would highly recommend the cow tongue. It doesn't sound appetizing but it's thinly sliced and cooks quickly, culminating in a juicy and tender bite. I was initially hesitant to try it but I was inspired by a quote from the legendary Charles P. Thompson: \"the secret to success is walking through each door that opens to you\". I was glad I listened to that advice!  I have never enjoyed chicken at KBBQ restaurants, but the chicken bulgogi here was actually really good. It's not in the same tier as the beef and pork dishes. They also have some side dishes included in the AYCE that are cooked in the kitchen - we had fried chicken, gyoza, and a steamed egg dish. The chicken and gyoza were great and helped break up the meat marathon! I personally would not recommend the steamed egg because I thought it tasted like an unseasoned omelette.   SERVICE: I did not think the service was amazing at filling up side dishes or water cups, but I did not have any complaints. This place was BUSY, so the fact that we were getting food brought out quickly was impressive. There were a few times where I was waiting for a water refill but I do not think it was enough to warrant docking a star.  Overall, I liked this joint a little more than GEN in Tempe Marketplace. I thought the meat was better here and I enjoyed the vibe more. The vents for the grills are also retractable at Manna, which really helped avoid some smoke when our grill started to char.   LASTING TIPS: - Use the Yelp Waitlist feature to put your name in early, since it can get pretty busy - Best if you come with a large group of people so you have room to try everything. We had 6 people and we were able to try just about all the meats on the menu. I've been to other places where it was just my GF and I and it was much harder to finish everything  - Designate one of your party as the official grill-master. It can be overwhelming to manage the grill and make sure not to cross-contaminate anything with raw meat - Relish in the meat burps the day after your meal",

    "text": "I've been meaning to try out another kbbq place and I had heard good things about Manna. Once you get there, you put your name on the waitlist on an iPad and they'll text you when there's a table available. I didn't realize they had this system beforehand, so there were about 3 parties before me when I got there. Alternatively, you can put your party on the waitlist through Yelp. Super helpful if you know you're about 15 min away and there is a 15 min wait - means you don't need to wait long after arriving.  We ended up adding 2 more people to our party after putting ourselves on the waitlist. No worries, because we informed the server of this update before our table was ready and she was able to find a table to fit all of us. We ordered soo many meats and dishes, I don't even remember what we all ordered. I just know that it was all SO good and I ate SO much. Some of my favorites were the galbi, bulgolgi, and chadol. For appetizers, we also got the gyoza, corn cheese, fried chicken, and steamed egg. I thought these were alright to try and to give myself a break from the meat, but the meats are definitely the star of the show. I really enjoyed the banchan, and we got like 3 refills.  The only thing was that it took a while to find someone to get water refills. But I understand because they were pretty busy. They were really good about switching out the grill when it got burnt though! Even though we had a relatively large party of 6, the wait wasn't bad at all for a Friday night dinner (~15 min).  I would definitely come back here. They have so many meat options and so many of them were really good. I feel like with some other places, they only have a few that are really good and the others are just alright. I came straight from a happy hour to this so needless to say, I left very full. It was so good though that I ate more than I normally would have. I would recommend coming with a group of friends because you can try a larger variety of meats/dishes!",

Despite people complimented how savory the food is, there are only 2 dips: soy sauce, salt and pepper. At Gen's there are more dipping sauces. The food is alright. They were filled with MSG. I was so thirsty. The soybean paste soup contains high level of salt. I couldn't finish 5 spoons of it.   I felt left out by the waiter. No one ever refilled my water after several times walking past two empty cups (one was my father's). We literally had the cups placed at the end of the table so their hawk's eyes could see. Nope. I didn't know if my table was assigned a specific server or not because the lady who first took my order came back only 3 times. A young lady also came by to take an order. A young lad cleaned up the plates.   This very same young lad filled up the water of the table across from us one table down and could not bring his eyes to see that our table also had two cups of empty water. After walking past as 3 times without doing anything, I had to bring up myself to tell him to refill the water. A customer shouldn't have to ask. That was supposed to be automatic. Well, maybe if the restaurant didn't put that many msg in, we wouldn't gulp down our water and waited for over 15 minutes afterward without anyone filling them up.   Although, I have to give one star more because they give a lot of food per plate. This may be bad for some people because they want to try more dishes than sticking up with the same old love.",

You get a variety of different things to stick on the table grill--beefs, porks, chickens, and seafoods, marinated (or not) in specific sauces.  I wasn't too thrilled with the octopus (literally 4-5 inch whole octopi).  The texture was not my thing, but that's not Manna's fault.  The beef was thin and like paper, but quite tasty.  I loved the chicken bulgogi and the pork.  I also got glass noodles and some rice.  Extra tasty, left with a full stomach.  If the pieces are large, you can cut the servings with food scissors.  Great, attentive service.  If you're looking for Manna from Heaven Korean-style, or maybe even Gangham-style, come here.",

Don't be intimidated, there are many happy and willing helpers at the restaurant that can show you the way to AYCE bliss. Ok, now it's time.for the meat sweats   This place is fantastic. I miss thier old menu, it seems they consolidated so that they have only one menu (rather than an A&B option),however there is still a plethora of options. My fave options are BEEF....brisket, tongue and the king among the beef choices, BELLY (think uncured bacon but BEEF, the fat ratio is outta control so there is so much flavor. Not to be forgotten are all the amazing appetizers, dishes and bachan (yummy kimchi and other small bites of flavorful often fermented foods), pork, chicken and seafood options. They also have marinated meats were are tasty, but I avoid sugar so I don't get them as often. My favorite is bulgogi and probably a good one to try if you've never had Korean food before. I always ask for sliced jalepenos and garlic as well to have with my meat. There is a grill mid table and a pull down vent, I don't wanna go into too much detail with this because they WILL help  it is well worth the price for the selection and experience.",

I believe it's 11.99 a person but each person can pick two appetizers along with two types of meat.. or you can you just stick with ur lunch ayce price of 17.99 during lunch hours or 24.99 during dinner.. but they have added cheesy corn along with Korean chicken wings and dumplings I believe with other many options they have like steamed egg and etc..",

It wasn't even that busy for a memorial day..  I've always been coming here whether they are busy or not but for the first time, I didn't like the service. We got seated and received our food after we ordered and that is about all there was. Our waitress passed by us as if we weren't even there. She checked other tables to see how they were doing. Another waitress came by and handed us pot stickers but we didn't even order that. I even made eye contact but bruh come on!  I waved here and there but they just hurried walking. Like bruh. After about a good 45 mins, the grill was burning with no more food on it and another waitress came by to check how we're doing since finally she noticed the thing was burning and after telling her we didn't order the pot stickers, she looked confused and grabbed it. I asked her for the check which never came until 15 mins after, this waiter asked if we needed more water but honestly we just wanted to leave and check please.  My friend jokingly said \"Is it because I'm black? No one is coming at our table. Look around girl, I'm the only black woman in here.\" And I said don't say that. Lol she said she'd rather go to Gen KBBQ in Tempe since we were served better there and never to take her here again.  I'd come back another day till I crave for kbbq again  1 star for service and 5 stars for the food.. sheesh!",

We stuck with our favorites of brisket, pork belly, spicy pork belly, and LA Galbi.  The selection of side dishes is pretty great as well. There were marinated beansprouts, marinated cucumbers, fish cake, kimchi, marinated radish, and mashed potatoes. I love eating a bite of radish with a bite of meat.  I will definitely be returning to Manna for my Korean bbq desires! Friendly staff and fresh meats makes a happy meal.",

There is plenty of options for meat and everything was pretty tasty. The ban chan was good. The quality of the meat was fine. We were there on a week end so it was pretty busy. They do take reservations. But because it was busy we did have to ask for some items or a drink multiple times before it would get to our tables.  Overall no major issues. Solid choice for bbq.",

Tried even octopus  there but my favorite was their chicken which was so tender and succulent. Later we ordered some macrons which are not part of the unlimited price.

The servers are attentive and helpful and we never had to wait long for the food. They also have a call button that you can use if you need your server to come to your table.

I love Korean BBQ, one of the biggest drawbacks is generally it's pretty expensive.  My wife and I would go and easily drop 100.00 if not more, and we don't even drink.  So I like places like Hoodori, ChoDang, Sizzle, and Ohya but I always spend a lot at those places and sometimes walk away not full.  Well after experiencing Manna BBQ I found it a much better experience and as far as the quality, it was right up there with those places.  For 28.99 a person, it's a heck of a deal.  So we ventured here on a Tuesday night, they were pretty busy and after reading the reviews, they get pretty packed on the weekends as well.  I came here with my wife and my brother and his girl.  We ordered variety of different meats, soups, and sides.  Everything was right on and delicious.  We ordered tons of food and the wait staff was extremely nice and helpful.  Overall, one heck of a dining experience.  I think this was one of the better meals I've had in a long time.  I am very impressed and would highly recommend this place to anybody.",

They were all very delicious and you could tell they were high quality. The banchan were really good too I never had macaroni salad at a Korean barbecue place. The staff was very attentive and frequently changed out our grills, the interior of the restaurant is really nice, and the bathrooms are situated at the perfect spot right in the front area. Lol I definitely will be coming back here regularly. It's the best Korean all you can eat place I've tried in Arizona so far.",

I usually go with the AYCE plan with premium meats since the quality and meat varieties are so much better than the regular one.   Food: They gave you beef tongues generously, unlike Gen only gave us a few slides every order. The meats are really fresh and marbling.   Service: Good. We've been here for a few times and all of the servers were extremely nice, especially a Korean lady who are super helpful and nice.  Con: they don't offer drinks with refill. That's probably the only con I could think of.  Price: a little pricer that other places but I think it worths.",

Really disappointed in the turn the service has taken. They never even turned on our grill, we had to figure it out ourselves. They never responded to the call buttons even though I was pressing it to try and get their attention. And they never changed our grill!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SERVICE?! I hope someone sees this and makes a change for the better or I won't be coming back. They've lost my business. Such a shame, I was a huge fan of the food. I just can't justify spending $30 a person to have such bad service. It's expensive. I expect to be taken care of.",

The latter is more forgivable since most kbbq places don't have it but given that the one place that does is its cali locations, it's hard not to compare. The place was nice, as clean as a kbbq joint can be and felt familiar. We'd been hankering for ayce kbbq and were excited when we heard gen was opening up, but even more excited when we realized there was a manna location opening up much closer. The staff were friendly, the food was good but their lack of rice paper and the realization they did not have the onion salad was so heartbreaking... im being dramatic. It's good, it's cheaper than gen, and normally not as busy. You don't get all the same items but you pay for what you get, and it'll satiate our needs until our trips back  to cali to the infallable 9.99 joints we're used to.",

I've found Manna has better meats than both.  Gen has better options in terms of off-grill items (like KFC and Gyoza) but I'd still choose Manna just for the quality of meats.  Price is fair for AYCE Korean BBQ and about what the average cost is in CA.  For service, at first, I thought it was lacking, but I started using the call button that's on each table.  Once I did that, service was superb.  I've noticed as of late service has been more proactive and much better.  Since coming here, I stopped going and trying other KBBQ places in the valley with the exception of going to Gen one more time.  However, that experience at Gen was definitely lacking and they've gone downhill since they first opened.  I look forward to my monthly visit to Manna every first of the month.  I would go more often, but I got to keep my belly size in check :).",

    "text": "I've been to many Korean barbecues (Yakinikus) so I have some experience in rating these types of restaurants. Three things I like to rate restaurants on are service and hospitality, quality of food, and pricing. Before I start my review, I'd like to inform you that this is an \"all you can eat\" yakiniku. You have two hours to eat whatever you order on their menu, so pace yourself and don't over order! You will be charged for leftovers!   First off, hospitality and service. Despite being absolutely busy the night I went, the waiters/waitresses were always prompt on tending to my requests. They have a button on the side of the table which calls a waiter or waitress over, and the response time was never more than a minute. The waiters and waitresses (Yakinikus don't function like traditional restaurants, you will be seeing more than one waiter/waitress while dining) were always courteous and addressed all my needs quickly. Excellent customer service and hospitality.  Second point. Food. The food was great. The restaurant is located right next to an Asian market, which is where I imagine they source all their meats and spices. Everything seemed authentic and tasted delicious. The bulgogi and kalbi were well marinated, I'd highly recommend you order these two items (they're a staple in Korean cuisine). The sides are also delicious and free, so don't hesitate to order more sides! Food was definitely a five out of five.  Now, for pricing. As you can expect out of an all you can eat restaurant, you pay a one time fee. I am quite embarrassed to say I don't remember how much I paid for my dinner (I had 6 family members that night), but I believe it came out to about $22 per person for dinner pricing, which is pretty damn good! Just make sure you eat three orders worth of meat per person if you want to get value out of your meal (that is if you don't mind looking like a glutton).   Overall, would highly recommend this restaurant! Good food, good pricing, and great service!",

After that it's like she was completely ignoring us. He table behind and across from us were getting great service and she stopped by there tables several times.  She even passed by and looked straight at me several times. Every time I pressed the call button, it was always someone else who came by. Someone finally saw we weren't being tended to and they became our new server. We were at the resuraunt about 45 min longer then we planned. This is all because we were straight up ignored for that amount of time.  I'm giving it a higher score this time because our replacement server was excellent.  He had a beard with reddish hair.",

It has the highest drink prices but lowest meal prices.  The marinades are stronger here, both sweeter and spicier.

It's hard to find descent Korean BBQ places in Arizona especially from being spoiled by the plethora of choices while traveling in California. When this place opened I was skeptical but I was pleasantly surprised. My biggest compliment would probably be the quality of their meat. There are many KBBQ places that may offer more of a selection of meats but their quality is nowhere near this place. They have all the essentials (Bulgogi, Brisket, Pork Belly, etc.) and their banchan selection is tasty as well. You can choose from two different AYCE options and the pricing is great for the quality and amount of food. So far I would say this place is one of the best in the area. I would recommend!",

I'm pretty sure y'all already know the whole thang with KBBQs by now, so imma just point out the things that make this place stand out.   Portion size - they. are. HUGE. Like if GEN brings one order of let's say beef belly, then the same one order here would be like two to three times the GEN's portion size. I LOVE that. I means it's gonna be AYCE already, no need to be stingy right? Manna BBQ, well at least currently, are doing portion sizes right   Price - kind of the same deal as other place. I think Mon - Thurs for lunch it's .. 17.99? That's pretty nice :) Fri-Sun is just always dinner prices.   Meat - okay y'all, I have always been a brisket kind of guy. But you know how sometimes the brisket can be just  but sometimes it's like \"eh\" and a bit dry? So here's the deal, get the BEEF BELLY. it's straight .com  it's like FATTY and soft and chewy and my goodness. Yea trust me you won't go wrong.   I also tried the premium menu a couple times, and they have this like \"jumoolok\" or something, a rib fillet and that meats marbling is quite ridiculous. So soft and tender.   I'm always a fan of the pork cheek, it's also on point here, but so is their pork belly. Nice and thick slices, also a fav.   Want something marinated? get the LA something galbi or bulgogi, but I'm more a non marinated type of guy.   Long story short : the KBBQ joint that has taken over GEN's number one spot for me",

I love Manna because there isn't much of a wait, they offer larger tables in a private room if you have a large party and all the meat was top quality.   We went here for my friends birthday with a party of 7. We were seated within minutes and the service was attentive. The whole table was adorned with sides and accompaniments while we waited to choose. They offer Soju though you need to check what flavors they offer. If you are eating as a group, make sure you all choose the same meat selection as they whole table has to be the same.  The beef was great quality and they let us order enough meat for one for each person. The pork belly was delicious, falvorful and the best part, you get to cook it yourself!!! You get to order as much meat as you want for 2 hours. Also they have steamed egg which was perfect and rice that you can order with your other choices.   One of the neat features is each station has a fan you can pull down to help pull up the smoke and heat. The price was decent, we spent $21 a person and although it was the cheaper option, the meat wasn't poor quality.  Tons of free parking in the area and they have other local businesses nearby such as a bakery, korean beauty and boba. So check it out and make it a fun day.",

With me, I think it's a little high since in GEN, they have more food but only $24.99  Service: This is the reason why I gave them 2 stars. We being served by an old Korean lady, and whenever we want to order more food, she gave us a look that we are BEGGING for food, which is make me really upset since we have to pay a lot for our lunch   Hopefully that they would be more better in service since I really love the food here.",

We did the $21.99 AYCE option which has our essentials when it comes to KBBQ: brisket, Kalbi, pork belly, octopus, bulgolgi, steamed egg and tofu stew versus $27.99 for the premium stuff. I even liked all the sides: raddish strips, raddish slices, kimchee, cucumbers, fish cakes, potatoes and salads. I left full and really likes the salt dip with my briskets. Would definitely return. Service is fast and friendly - with a call button at your table if you need immediate assistance. Plentiful parking in the plaza lot too.",

I went to lunch with my wife and it was a great experience. The service was super friendly as well. The addition of the movable vent hoods and call button made for less smoke and easy service calls for more meat.   The meat itself was great: good cuts of meat with good marbleization. The marinated bulgogi was delicious as well. One of the huge pluses too was the meat was fresh and came out rolled (instead of the lukewarm meat I've been served before). This makes for unraveling and grilling a lot easier.   Overall, I'd definitely be coming back to this place. Maybe dinner though since I can try even more types of meat.",

    "text": "This place was pretty good. We are very familiar with Korean BBQ so we have some good experience to compare to. This place is an all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ restaurant. They have 2 different tiers you can order. We went with the cheaper one because we didn't think the other meats offered in the more expensive one was worth the price difference. That and we didn't really care for the other meats. The cheaper one has more than enough choices for a great experience.   The staff was friendly. The owner came and talked to us and gave us suggestions of which meats to order. He even gave us hints to the more expensive meats on the menu, and let us know that the cheaper meats make him more money. Although the cheaper meats are very good, he said to try to fill our bellies with the more expensive ones! It was very honest and kind of him.   The wait staff seemed a little busy but they did an acceptable job. There is a button on the wall you can push to summon them, so that is pretty nice. The restaurant is pretty crowded in the sense that there is not a lot of space to walk around. The tables are close together and the paths of travel tend to get congested.   The woman's restroom is a bit wacky. One of the toilet stalls are so small, there is no way you can sit and use it. It seems that the restrooms were retrofitted to an existing space. It's definitely not an acceptable size, but there is another toilet next to it that is big enough. I just thought it was funny.   Overall, this is one of the best in the PHX area. I haven't tried Gen BBQ yet, but I have heard this place gives it a run for its money.",

    "text": "When in Mesa, you've got to hit up some of the best Asian restaurants in the city.   We had just walked for about 3 hours, fueled mainly on trail mix, jerky, and Cheetos (okay, so the Cheetos were all me). So we weren't going to mess around when we got in here. Premium All You Can Eat was the way to go. And we certainly ate all we could, and then dessert on top of that.   I was lucky enough to have two grill masters as dining companions this Sunday evening, so my friend and I sat back and watched the many plates of ordered meat get cooked in front of us: bulgogi, pork jowl, shrimp, rib eye, spicy samgyup sal, more bulgogi... we had more, but hell if I can remember it.   The truth is, you don't need to be a grilling pro for this. It's so simple. Just toss your meat on there and flip. The servers come by often enough to check up on you. There's also a button on the wall for you to press if you're in desperate need of more bulgogi. The servers came by quite often to our table to turn up our fan and change out our hot plate. We had a great time. And all our food was so flavorful and delicious. I think the only thing we weren't completely sold on were the shrimp. Those got messy, removing the veins and shells.    For sides, we requested bowls of rice, japchae (glass noodles), and soon dubu (tofu stew). Nothing to write home about with these, but they were just fine for sides. The tofu stew had a nice spice to it and had maybe oysters in it? Not bad.   There's a time limit of 2 hours, and at about 1.5 hours, we were slowing down. After finishing off the last of what meat was left on the plates (can't let that go to waste... oof), we ordered two coffee ice cream macarons and one vanilla. The perfect ending.",

Today, I come here with my boyfriend to eat.. We walk in Get sat,  We wait for 15, it shouldn't take that long for us to have someone come by and Greet us, give us drinks or even take our drink order.  No Ban Chan set up around,  I press the call button, no one shows up to ask if we need something... They turn off the alert and ignore us.   We wait a few minutes longer.  I get up and go I ask to speak to the Manager,  She comes to me, doesn't offer an Apology, no explanation to why we aren't getting any service.   It was very upsetting cause last night it was super busy, today it was not busy at all, there were a lot of empty tables.   Please do not support this type of business.  I love korean food, lived in Korea for a long time I am not brand new to the culture.   I'm very upset about how these people behaved.  Especially the manager who decided to Do nothing about it.   You want a better experience go to GEN ! Tempe market place.  Quality of food is much better at GEN  The marinades and Sauces are delicious.  Manna Is a terrible excuse for Korean food.",

They have a huge selection and will serve you as quickly as you can eat so you get your money worth (around $25 per person). Gets pretty busy on the weekends so I would recommend getting there early.",

    "text": "Best Korean BBQ in AZ! All you can eat with two options: premium or regular. The price difference is, in my personal opinion, insignificant. As such, I'd recommend getting the premium if you wanna try the good meat. My favorite is the cow tongue so I always get the premium when I visit.   The servers will not cook for you here unless you ask. If you're not sure how to do it, I would ask for assistance or bring someone who has experience!   The service is overall decent but manna needs to be clearer with their rules and stick with it. Last time I went with a group of 12+ they told us they gave away our spot because we were late. I asked if there was a grace period and they mentioned 10 minutes. Checked the time and we had two minutes before the grace period was up. So we ended up waiting another good 15 min which isn't too bad. Parking is a bit of pain as it's next to the Asiana market.",

This is the best Korean BBQ we have found since moving to AZ. All of the meats are delicious as are the salad and sides. I also always order a tofu stew! The only thing I wish were different is that they don't serve rice paper like we are used to. I love wrapping the meat in the rice paper, but it's not a make or break. The service is great as well. I highly recommend trying them out especially if you have never had KBBQ!",

    "text": "Today, I have made a visit to the second All you can eat Korean barbecue restaurant that have opened in the last month. The popularity and the expectations are great since these places are here in the valley to satisfy the cravings of meat loving foodies for all you can eat service. Right out of the bat, the concept of all you can eat might question the restaurant's quality of the food and service however, at Manna Korean Barbecue Restaurant there was nothing but not only quantity but quality. First, when you walk in the bright smiles from the host and server greets you as you are guided to either a booth or tables that could fit a big party. The server has picked a big open table for us since the at the time of our visit was before the dinner rush. Looking around I was able to see the neat table with bright colored booth that was extremely comfortable to sit in for hours. There were televisions everywhere, pleasurable music coming from the speakers throughout the restaurant filling the missing spots just enough to sound enjoyable among the sounds of meats being grilled. For the menu, I was provided two options. For different prices, there were more options of meats. The most expensive option having six more different types of meats, I went with the option that I could try every type of entree from the restaurant which was priced at $28.99 per person. A bit on the expensive side, there is an option for $21.99 however, they provided enough options so you won't be missing out on the house specials. I was impressed with all the variety of meats that came out and tasted absolutely great. It was very interactive where I had to grill myself. Each order of entree plates came out bright red and marvelously. My personal favorites being beef bellies, bulgogi, and spicy pork bellies, after every bite I was in awe of how incredible it tasted. These meats not only tasted great but I felt the amount of work and effort was shown with every cut of the meat that came out. They were tender, without the foul smell that I would usually expect at an all you can eat restaurant--since coming from Korea I know how it usually goes. They definitely scored both quality and quantity side of the restaurant which made me even be worried about the restaurant's budget. Lastly, the cherry on the top of this restaurant experience was the attentive service that they provided. With every entree, they explained every different parts. Changing the grill that often needs to be replaced, and filling the side dish every now and then. This was a complete all you can eat Korean barbecue experience that I craved for. I completely recommend this restaurant for your all you can eat experience. As I mentioned, this was the second Korean barbecue restaurant of the valley as of recent. Manna and Gen Korean Barbecue, the two that are opened, have very different characteristics. I would prefer Manna because of the food, service, and ambiance that I have explained above.",

I'm more interested in being able to try different items but I felt grossed out when they brought out what seemed like 1lb of meat per order... so overkill.

    "text": "2nd time here, 1st time wasn't great, but it hadn't been awful, so we tried it again. This time, it was much more obvious- while one usually already knows that the quality of the meat is a little less than ideal at all-you-can-eat places to begin with, the quality of the meat here literally made it inedible for the most part. At first, I thought the portions were generous, but I'm finding out that that's probably because they cut the meats so thin (i.e., the pork jowl seems like a large portion compared to what you get elsewhere, but they're cut so thin that it's deceptive). The steaks and various beef choices just had a very very old taste to it, the meat just tasted like it was old and had a slight cardboard box whiff to it when you tried to eat it. The service is fine, it's just the quality of the meat they use is way below what I'm used to, and way worse than any AYCE place. Gen, while they no doubt use lesser quality meats as well, it isn't nearly as pronounced as it is at Manna. As a Korean man who has tried basically every decent Korean BBQ joint in Southern CA over the last couple decades, as well as most of the Korean restaurants in AZ, this place falls dead last, AYCE or not. We will not be returning here.",

It wouldn't have been difficult if he had written it down in the first place. The manager came by to check on us, seconds later our server comes by saying that his manager was complaining that we had to many sides on our table?!? How rude!!! What kind of management is this? After we were done with our meal the server comes by and tells us you told me you were gonna finish the sides and you didn't!!!  I am so speechless! Save your money y'all! Don't come to this place!!",
