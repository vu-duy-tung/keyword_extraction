The shrimp was fresh, lettuce and Thai basil-so fresh. The employees were friendly. There was no language barrier for allergy free ordering. I tried #38. Banh Xeo; a half order of a Vietnamese crepe. Heaven. I can not wait to get it again. Thank you Pho 43 Express!!",

    "text": "Are you the type of person who likes to explore new places? A True adventurer by definition? Have I got a hot one for you; 43rd Express, aka; 'Pho 43rd'.  Owned by the same Vietnamese family for over twenty years, Pho 43rd, despite its dive-like ambiance both inside and out, is truly a charm.  The pho is above average and served with all the accoutrements; bean sprouts, Vietnamese basil, and jalapenos.  Try the beef, tripe and tendon pho, asking them to conspicuously leave out the tendon and tripe. (I never said I was an adventurer, I only asked if you were) It's delicious.  Their sauces are a delight, featuring a traditional siracha, their own chili paste, and a delicious homemade hoisin sauce.  Spring rolls were light and wonderfully tasty. A strong recommend.  The service is fast and very friendly. Upon leaving, the owner introduced himself and gave us a brief history of the restaurant:  -How he and his brother worked in the kitchen since they were small children. -How the family has owned the restaurant for over twenty years, surviving the great recession.  -How mom is now retired, passing on the family business to her sons.   His story was impressive. One that makes anyone not familiar with the restaurant industry know just how difficult it is to succeed in this type of business, with all the hard work and sacrifice. Pho 43rd ceased to be a dive at that point, embodying the True spirit of capitalism and the American dream.  I left, feeling both satiated, and proud of David (owner) and his family for what they've accomplished.  If you're disinclined to visit a place like this based on its location and outward appearance, you'll be missing out.   IMPORTANT NOTE: THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH.",

Their food is a big NO. I used to live in little saigon,  so I have high expectation for vietnamese foods. But, sorry to say, their food is not even close to standard.  I saw some reviews that screamed out for Bun Bo Hue aka spicy beef noodles, so we tried.  Huge mistake; it looks like a good one but tastes nothing like one. It's a double No for me.   Pho and rice dishes are maybe/no. Maybe for people who are craving for pho  and have nowhere else to go;  No for people just want to get some good food. I would love to give more stars for their macaroon,  but I'm  too disappointed.",

    "text": "Com Tam Bi Cha Suon Nuong Trung Chien (Rice Dishes #23): Menu description: Broken rice w/ shredded pork, steamed egg, BBQ pork chop & pan fried egg This was a large, delicious dish with a variety of flavors for a great price ($7)! I occasionally poured fish sauce over this dish and enjoyed everything on the plate. The BBQ pork chop was tender and flavorful. The shredded pork wasn't as flavorful, but added a nice texture to the dish overall. The steamed egg and pan fried egg were delicious, and I mixed bites of those with rice and pork. The cucumber and pickled carrots on the side added a refreshing crunch in between bites of everything else on the plate. This also came with a small bowl of broth, which I assume was their pho broth. That was a perfect addition, as I was craving some pho but didn't want to order a whole bowl. The portion size of this is quite large, and it definitely filled me up. Overall, the variety of flavors and textures on this plate is great and cheap! I would definitely get this again.  Che Ba Mau (Beverages #17): Menu description: Sweet Red Bean, Topped W/ Mung Bean, Jello & Coconut Milk I got this for free from the Yelp check-in offer! This was more like a dessert than a beverage. The bottom 75% this consists of sweet red beans, and this is topped with green jello and coconut milk on top. This wasn't bad per se, it's just not something I would order again. I personally thought it was a bit too sweet, and I was expecting more of a liquid-like drink than something so solid. I left this mostly uneaten, mostly just because I was full by the end of the meal. Try this if you like sweet desserts or red beans.  Macaroons: I just got two regular (non ice-cream) macaroons, since I was very full by the end of my meal. The raspberry and strawberry flavors I tried were delicious! The flavors were actually intense and sweet without being overbearing. I definitely want to try an ice-cream version next time!",

The portion sizes are pretty darn big. Their medium sized bowls are extra large at other places. But i had a problem with their broth. It's got too much artificial spices, me and my company each had to drink 2 bottles of water afterwards and couldn't help but fall asleep due to MSG. I had high hopes for macaron ice cream but that too, nothing is house made. This is a busy place so I didn't expect a hotel quality service but we never got a refill on water. Btw they dont bring you a check you need to walk up to the register and pay for your food.",

It isn't watered down like most viet restaurants have them. It's made to perfection. So delicious I don't even need to add anything to it. I used to always eat here once a week with my bf. Before work or on my days off. It helps that he also know the people that own this place cause they always know how to take care of us. Keep up the good work guys : ) oh and don't forget to try their ice cream macarons!! You won't be disappointed!",

Place was packed on a sunday night and the service was friendly and attentive.   I ordered the tofu pho and vegetable spring rolls and my husband got the meat versions lol. Food was all out within 10 minutes of ordering, very happy. Huge portions, this is one of the first places where they give you 3 fat spring rolls, usually its like 2 skimpy rolls so this was a good start to the meal. Peanut sauce was smokey and sweet with a nice creamy texture that complemented the crunch of the spring roll. Pho arrived and i was immediately hit with the deep roasted and spiced smell of the broth and herbs of the soup. Nice big portion too. So flavorful!   You can tell they take pride in their food and really do it right. Even the owner was going around checking on customers and refilling waters. They had fresh handmade macaroons too but we were too full to indulge, next time for sure. I will definitely be back and as long as they are consistent with the quality and flavor i experienced today, i will have  finally locked in my pho spot!",

The dish comes with the standard dish of bean sprouts, lettuce, jalapenos and lime.  The soup is sprinkles with lots of roasted garlic which made it really tasty.  I don't eat pork and hubby was more than happy to eat it for me.  I noticed that most of their other dishes have pork.  That will not stop me from returning though.  The broth was exceptional as was the ingredients.  The price is more than fair.",

This family-run restaurant is located in an unassuming building with a small parking lot and the interior is crowded with small tables. However, the service is top-notch and the food is to die for. Our server was so friendly and considerate-- we would almost go again just for him! He was patient and helpful with his recommendations and just an all-around nice, friendly guy. We had egg rolls and spring rolls to start (both excellent), mango smoothies (yummy, but not totally necessary), and pho. Oh man, the pho was so good. The broth was tasty and the noodles were cooked just right. We didn't get to try the macaroons, as they are made by the server's sister and are only available on certain days/times, but I would like to go back to try them. We stuffed ourselves silly while there and walked away painfully full, but satisfied. Can't wait to go back!  Pros: -Delicious food. -Great service. -Good prices. -Family business.  Cons: -Location. It is quite a drive for us. -Limited parking.",

Actually, the macarons were pretty fancy ;) We started with the summer rolls, which were packed full. The sauce that comes with it was amazing- not too sweet and not too peanut-y like some places. We each ordered a bowl of pho. The broth was smooth and the meat plentiful. Now to the best part- the MACARONS. I've had many macarons both good and bad and these were primarily why I wanted to come here. I saw their macaron ice cream sandwiches and knew I had to try. In my opinion I think these are way better than a certain shop in LA (that I won't name) where I waited in line for 45 minutes... Had the taro cookie with pandan ice cream. The cookie is so chewy and the taro flavor really comes out. Left home with a box of macarons and every weekend I want more..",

They now have chicken pho, but I don't think it's on the menu.   The rare beef pho was delicious. What others have said about the fragrant broth is True. You could eat a whole bowl of just the broth.   I tried their coconut drink ($2.75) and it was amazing. You get a whole coconut with a straw and spoon for the flesh.   I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for no nonsense good pho in a clean, welcoming environment. It's very mom-n-pop.  Last note, they do take credit cards now via Square.",

We ordered the steak pho and a pork dish that came with the broken rice, a sunny side up egg, and something else we couldn't really identify. It tasted a little fishy... not sure what it was, I wasn't a fan, but my husband seemed to enjoy it.   The pho broth was very flavorful and came with fresh basil and bean sprouts. The portion was more than enough and prices where very reasonable.   Don't forget to check in and get your free drink. I ordered the fresh orange juice, which in fact was fresh with pulp and seed. My husband got the fresh lemonade, which was very tasty as well.",

A friend and I went on a Thursday afternoon and it wasnt very busy, the waiter was very nice to recommend his favorite bowl of pho and as soon as the food came I. Was. DYING. No joke this is the best pho in AZ, the broth was perfect, the meat was perfect, theres just something about it that made it....perfect! May seem like an exaggeration but hey I drove an HOUR from the east side for this place and would do it every week from now on as a ritual! You can imagine how excited I was for dessert! Only reason this place didnt get 5 stars is because they dont sell their good stuff on the weekdays. Like they only had an extremely limited amount of a macaroon selection and it was eh. I was hoping to get a crazy Captain Crunch rolled one or something so I was kinda bummed.  Still, ill be coming back for the pho regardless because this ish is divine.",

The pho broth is really really tasty- normally I add hoisin sauce and Sriracha to my pho broth but found myself not wanting to change the depth of flavor that was in this bowl. I also had the fried egg rolls. Delicious :) full of meat!  The best part was the macarons! I tried the massive macaron ice cream sandwich in the pandan flavor- a flavor that I normally don't stumble upon in normal French pasty shops selling macarons. It was delicious.  You can tell its a friendly family run business and they take pride in their product. Everyone was very friendly and they tried really hard to get us seated quickly despite the wait. I would definitely return if it wasn't so far away!",

I had been looking up reviews on different pho restaurants and this location came up so my mom and I went for breakfast and upon arriving the restaurant looks a little sketchy from the outside but once inside it's quite cozy and casual. We got seated immediately, and served fast! I asked the waitress for a few minutes just to see what we wanted. She came back within 5 minutes or so and we ordered the number 1 and number 2 with spring rolls. We got our food pretty promptly, and people started to roll in. The PHO WAS DELICIOUS! so warm and delicious, they give you a side of bean sprouts, lime, and Thai basil. They're selection of Chile sauces are amazing! I would say go earlier in the day because it does get packed, we arrived about 10am and by the time we left around 11:30 there  were people waiting outside to get in. It is definitely a lot of food, so order wisely. You won't be disappointed with this little spot",

Definitely order them with the peanut dipping sauce, you will not be disappointed! So fresh tasting.

They technically are two different stores in one bc if you order anything macaron related its not apart of your pho bill which was a little confusing but it's ok.    Pho all in all was very good as well, great broth and nice large portions for pretty cheap! It also cured my awful hangover almost instantly which just goes to show just how great the broth is.  I'm from Texas and never have I seen a bowl of pho for less than 7 dollars and here it was around 6 dollars I believe. I was in shock and if I lived in Arizona I'm sure you would find me here often.",

    "text": "Pho is flavorful and portions are generous. My son and I could easily share one bowl. However, my group and I were disappointed by their lackluster service. No smile. No greeting. Not one thank you. No personality it felt like.  Even after I went out of my way to say how delicious their pho was. Also, did not see one single macaron or their pretty pastel chalkboard menu as I've seen in photos. Maybe I was oblivious??... upon entering they proudly display the \"People on Yelp Love Us\" sticker. Very casual atmosphere. Nothing fancy. I was looking forward to this Yelp find.  We seated ourselves when no one led us to a table. There were about five other tables of diners. And when we did receive menus, it took longer than a few moments for the server to return for our order, despite that we saw four people standing behind the register on their phones or chatting. Once ordering we waited at least ten-fifteen minutes for our pho and egg rolls. Longest I've ever waited for pho. It just seemed unusually long for pho. I noticed their condiment tray on each table is wiped down cleanly, and neat! Nice to see. However, ours needed spoons to be replenished. Other than that, all their sriracha and hoisin bottles did not have a single drop of disarray to them.  Egg rolls were delicious. It's a unique filling, seems like all the ingredients are ground up, but whatever the combination of meats and spices, it was tasty. Platter of greens and bean sprouts were plentiful. Pho, again, was delicious. We ordered extra noodles to share our bowls with the kids and still found we had too much food. I do love their pho here. Server did return once to ask how our meal was, again, no smile or personality. No water refill. Due to the lackluster customer service though, we hastily just ate and left. I completely forgot to ask for their macaron. Looking back on my photos and dining, I remember the fridge looking very sparse so maybe they were out of stock on macarons at that time. I'll revisit and try this place again another time. Walked myself up to the counter to pay the bill. Four diners, two pho's, two sides of noodles and an order of egg rolls, our meal came to $30 with tip.",

I felt so insulted that I decided not to dine in rather order to go. She continued to belittle my inquiries regarding the menu until I finally asked her why she is so rude. She raised her voice and demanded we leave. My family was so insulted. As a mother, wife, and professional I chose not to engage and left.

Place is a humble restaurant in that it is clean, but nothing to look at.  You know how I feel.  I don't eat decor; I eat food. Had the spring rolls as appetizers but instead of the shrimp, pork, etc I decided to have them made with just TOFU.  Three very large, fresh rolls that were really good.  Ordered the rare beef/brisket PHO which came in a large bowl with an ULTRA HUGE portion of the greens that you put in the soup--meaning basil leaves, cilantro, peppermint, jalapenos, lime slices and fresh bean sprouts.  Enough for two soups.   What a delicious broth!  Rare beef was indeed rare and delicate as it was sliced thin.  5 stars on the pho. Also had chicken fried rice which I was curious about--Vietnamese fried rice??? Hmmmm.......   Arrived with lots of veggies in it along with the chicken.  Good flavor.  Nicely prepared--not greasy.  Why is chinese fried rice so greasy sometimes?  Take note.   I ordered the half order of the crepe stuffed with shrimp and pork.  I think it's 38A on the menu.  Very good except I think it needed more salt.  I added soy sauce and it was fine.   This place has a dessert menu that includes Maccarons.... no, not Macaroons made of coconut.  Maccarons are small, light , flavored \"cookies\" which are a specialty of French bakeries.  Not surprising that a Vietnamese restaurant would carry these.  After all the French did occupy Vietnam thereby influencing its cuisine.  (e.g. the crepe).  I wanted to taste just one and chose the pistachio flavor.  It arrived a bluish-green color.  I expected the usual light green color.  I tasted it and while it was delicate (it is made of egg whites), it did not have any pistachio flavor.   Basically, they were nothing special.  But I think it may be unfair of me to assess these Macarons since I have eaten many, many of them in France where they masterfully create these bits of deliciousness.  Paris bakers are the king and queens of making macarons so I cannot expect a restaurant on 43rd Avenue in Phoenix to even begin to compete.  No need to. I came for great Vietnamese food and I got it.",

I thought maybe I made a mistake so I went back a year later & they overcharged again 20%.  I asked for receipt and copy of menu and they said they are out of menus and they will email me receipt. How are they going to email me receipt if they do no have my my email address? The spring rolls are cold, straight out of refrigerator. The Pho is good though.  Bunch of crooks.  Eat here but do NOT leave tip!",

It's pretty much the definition of hole-in-the-wall: it's in what looks like a former KFC and the parking lot is a disaster. I'm not Vietnamese, so I can't speak to the authenticity, but every entree I've gotten here I've enjoyed. The spring rolls weren't my favorite--they felt a little dry for some reason (even with the dipping sauce).   I happened to be there on a weekend and got the macaron ice cream sandwiches. Also fantastic--only tough thing was that the ice cream was so tall, I couldn't really eat the whole thing at once (not that that stopped me from trying).",

It's a pretty far trek for me to come here, but what draws me in is when I have a craving for the macaroons and the macaroon ice cream sandwiches which are decently priced. I like that you get a free drink with a yelp check in, but I've had problems with what free drinks that includes since it was not very clear. The first time I was able to get soymilk for free and a couple weeks later I was informed after I ordered that it was not included anymore.  The broth for the pho is a hit or miss, the first time it was too salty but the second time I came it was perfect. The pork rice dish was good, but again it was not the best I've had and other places have this dish down way better.",

    "text": "This family owned and operated Pho shop has captured my girlfriend and I and will not let go! We usually try to experience a new Pho shop every Sunday across the valley, as it's our little tradition. We were getting into our high teens of different places then we stepped foot in Pho 43.   Depending on what day and time you can either expect to be seated right away, or in 45 minutes as there are ALWAYS people there. Even if you have to wait, it's worth it. The family that runs it is very sweet and come up to your table while serving you and make you feel part of their family. This Pho hands down is the top Pho in the Valley!   I order the combo Pho except instead of tribe I add meatballs. The broth is a little sweeter compared to others but still takes it. When it comes to meat, both the quantity and quality are superior. My girlfriend and I have both agreed that the meatballs they put in the Pho are not only the best Vietnamese meatballs we've ever tried but possibly the best meatballs period. The flank, brisket and rare steak are all seasoned individually and you can definitely taste it when you try each one.   Could not say enough great things about this place!",

Customer service was great, we got greeted when we walked in and were able to sit wherever we wanted.  We ordered pho #1 with 3 different types of meat and my boyfriend #10 with steak and meatballs. Both came out quick and steaming! It was delicious and super cheap each plate was around $7. The sizes were big and they are not stingy with the meat.   For dessert we got the macaroon ice cream. It was panda with dulce de leche. Very tasty. We were super full that we will have to come back for the teas and smoothies, oh and to try different macaroons!",

I chose pistachio, taro, Nutella, chocolate, coffee, and raspberry. The colors on them were beautiful, especially the teal on the pistachio. Easy to order and I received my macarons quickly since they were in the fridge at the front. Good customer service.   Pistachio: didn't taste like it, more fruity but still good. Taro: don't know what it tastes like since I've never had it, but I liked it. Nutella: it didn't have a hazelnut chocolate taste, but I love chocolate so I enjoyed it.  Chocolate: my favorite, never lets me down. Coffee: good coffee taste, up there with the chocolate.  Raspberry: tasted fruity but not really raspberry-ish.  They had other flavors to choose from like fruity pebbles, strawberry, cookies and cream and more. I didn't get a chance to try the ice cream sandwiches but I will next time I visit! I really want to try their Thai iced tea flavors, since that's one of my favorite drinks.",

I'm fairly loyal when it comes to Pho, if I've found one that's real good (such as this one) I'll stick with it unless there's some bad experiences...    I always get #1 SUPER DUPER.  Believe me, they're not kidding when they use these words.  The bowl is SUPER huge and they fill it up all the way to the top.  I've been here quite a few times and only ONCE I was able to finish it in one go.   The other item I get is spring rolls, very good size, tasty and the sauce is great.    Now there's a few negatives I like to point out about this place but it's not all bad.    1.  It gets crowded during lunch/dinner time and waiting on a table can be long.   2.  There's just not enough parking, I always end up parking in the back of the building...   3.  There's only one small bathroom 4.  Sometimes they close early (Sat/Sun) when they have a special event they need to attend.    Other than that, the food is great and the service is great.",

Eating basil leaves with lemon and salt is a great appetizer while I wait. Parking can be a real pain but they have a tiny lot. I believe that they are family owned and some of the servers are not to friendly and I feel like that's what is lacking in pho 43. Like they know they have good food and people will come back so why go above and beyond? I don't know . They always hook us up though. I got my order to go and was kind of surprised that I had to cook the beef for the beef pho for a second or 2 because they gave it to me raw. Maybe it's a personality thing. Maybe it's maybelline.   One more thing. The shrimp spring rolls had 3shrimp cut is half so I was kind of getting only 1.5 shrimp per roll. Kind of mean guys. But hey your peanut sauce is impeccable !!   Oh and I never come by in time for the macaroons !!! I was in town for a couple of days and couldn't stay till Sat or Sun. Broke my heart you guys didn't have any available.",

I had heard about the macaron ice cream sandwiches so I was very eager to try one.  I ordered the red velvet macaron with chocolate chip ice cream in the middle.   It was so good!!  I recommend eating it right away before the ice cream starts to melt.  The texture is chewy and True to the flavors you choose.  A lot macarons these days are just sweet, but this place does it right!  The owner must have seen how excited I was because he gave my husband and I each regular macaron on the house!  I thoroughly enjoyed their customer service.  Since this was our first visit to 43rd Express, we were shown how to eat the dishes by pouring a special sauce over the meal.  My dish came with a fried egg, which was cooked the way I wish all eggs would be cooked.  You can see what I mean by some of the pictures posted on Yelp.  The fried eggs are crispy underneath and around the edges, and is just so perfect.  The entree I ordered came with a bowl of broth on the side.  The flavor rich and comforting.  43rd Express is now my go-to Vietnamese restaurant in town.  Five stars!!",

I just recently moved from California so it is very hard to find a good Pho here in Arizona. Well 43rd Express has me settle down with their Pho.. Their Pho broth has a fragrant that reminds me the one from Vietnam..that shows how good their Pho is. Hands down.. I also love how they have a good service. Last time I wanted to try their Bun Bo Hue and their Sam Bo Luong, but they ran out. They apologized and let me switch my order to Bun Thit Nuong and Thai Tea. I would love the Bun Thit Nuong more if the noodles are little bit more dry instead it is still wet like it had just been cooked and drain and didnt have time to dry.  I also ordered the Vietnamese Coffee..OMG sooo good...it is just right for me, not too bitter or overwhelminy sweet..Perfecto.. I came back today to try their Bun Bo Hue again and it was good. I love how tender the meat is, it just falls off from the chopsticks and melt in your mouth... And you know the real reason to come back again is for their awesome macarons. The owner showed me every flavors of macarons and he let me pick out from the box..How Awesome is that??? Million thumbs up ^^ I will come back again definitely.",

    "text": "Bottom line up front:  \"Diamond in the rough\"  Through the years I've been accustomed to taste with my eyes before I approve with my palette.  Thus, I never really wanted to try Pho 43rd Express.  There is nothing special about its name, its surrounding, or the building itself.  If you make your way to the restaurant, the first thing you may notice is a crooked sign in the parking lot - which I'm sure an idiot with a large truck backed in to - and it makes you wonder:  what is so damn special about this place?  I finally have an answer so I'll attempt to articulate my experience and ingredients of \"special\".    Firstly, the food is . . . uniquely delicious.  Pho is pho is pho:  noodles, broth, meat, sauce, etc.  But 43rd's pho is different.  The broth is richer in flavor and exposes a hint of sweetness which makes the soup so satisfying, with or without additives (lime, cilantro, brown/red sauce, others).  And with the addition of lime, cilantro, those green leaves that I've never seen in other cuisines, sprouts, jalapenos (some are extremely spicy, but worth it every time), and sauce, I am ready to say goodbye to the world for 15 minutes and eat away my hunger, hangover, and sorrows.  And this is just one of their many offerings.  On other occasions, my stomach frequents \"Vietnamese pancakes\" when I want something different than the usual; those noodles topped with egg-rolls, veggies, and fish sauce when I want something filling but light; and various rice plates when I'm uncertain of what I want.  I am certainly ignorant for not remembering the names of each dish, but that's tolerated at 43rd Express and leads to my next point - the service.    Being family owned and operated, the staff work together as a family should.  They are close-knit and humorously bicker among each other, but remain focused, cohesive and entertaining, as an added bonus.  I laugh and sometimes chime in with a few words of my own which makes the enjoyment a two-way street and increases my odds for the occasional free dessert.  Also, it allows them to remember me and my food preferences, thus allowing me to remain ignorant with dish names.   The last thing I want to point out are the dessert offerings.  Available sweets include macarons, cream puffs, and ice cream.  I have concluded that there is some type of sorcery involved in creating these soft little delicacies.  In my opinion, the macarons are excellent (just-enough crunchy outer texture with a soft and gratifyingly chewy center) but the cream puffs are just better.  The filling reveals creamy and buttery sweetness without overwhelming the outer layer's taste and maintains the right amount of firmness that allows a few bites without having to tear the poor thing with your fingers and teeth.  However, I think it's best if eaten whole.  Perhaps two at a time.    And with these three ingredients mixed together, refined over time, results Pho 43rd Express.  A diamond in its natural form, a True bang for your buck, an absolutely special restaurant that offers delicious food, second-to-none desserts, and good vibes.    Thanks for reading!",

I always grab a rau ma or iced coffee when I'm here too but it's probably cause they're the best when you're hungover. Definitely also recommend saving some room for an ice cream macaroon preferably the taro cookie and Pandan ice cream flavors.",

So my advice is to actually go early or at a reasonable time for lunch on Sunday if you want to avoid missing out on these delicious desserts.    I've had the red velvet w/ Thai tea ice cream.  Sooo good.  I'm no macaron connoisseur, but it had just the right amount of firmness on the outside and soft gooeyness on the inside, which held up well as the end pieces of the contained ice cream.   I will definitely be back for these!  The free drink from yelp check is always welcome!  and the vermicelli w/ grilled pork was delicious.",

    "text": "I hardly want to tell anyone, because I want to keep the place all to myself.  WOW.  Be adventurous. Try the soda with egg yolk and condensed milk, or the salty plum soda.  The soup bowls are gigantic. The egg rolls come with a platter of greens and dipping sauce. The prices are inexpensive and the service is great.  At 2pm all the tables were full. That tells you something.  UPDATE:  Went the very next day with entire family. We each tried a different rice noodle soup. Everyone liked what they got, but we will note that meat is more of a garnish, so if you want more meat, you should order an extra order of it ont he side, which a lot of people do. But just know that at $6-9 (depending on what kind of soup you order), you are getting a lot of food that will fill you up, if you like a lot of fresh vegetables, noodles and broth. The broth is heavenly.  On our way out we were followed out the front door to be given a rare treat: a macaroon ice cream sandwich, gratis. Now they probably don't make a habit of doing this, but we thought it was very generous, and it tasted out of this world!  This is probably going to be a go-to lunch spot form now on!",

I ordered the taro ice cream with taro macaroon and it was the best sweet I had in a long time, I love anything taro and they definitely have that flavor down. My girl ordered a red velvet macaroon with strawberry ice cream and she too enjoyed hers.

When you walk in you will get a whiff of something delicious cooking in the back.  We ordered Thai tea and Jasmine ice tea which was ok. Then we got the egg rolls and shrimp rolls which was also good. Then of course Pho for 2. We both thought the Pho was pretty good and the broth was little on the sweet side but still delish.  Now after seeing all the picture of the macaroons I had to save room for them. I tried the taro with ice cream and plain and it was too sweet for me.  The service was great. Well if I'm in this part of town I will definitely be here eating again.",

    "text": "My wife, the Sinaloence, had visited this small Mom & Pop restaurant a few weeks ago with a girlfriend. We were in the middle of doing chores driving here to there when she spotted the restaurant (Pho 43 Express) and prevailed on me to sample the Vietnamese cuisine.  On entering it appeared as any hole-in-the-wall food place. Eleven tables in all - with four of the tables able to seat six to eight patrons comfortably. Now don't get me wrong, for me, a hole-in-the-wall restaurant is generally a good thing. We are all acquainted with the major chain restaurants and their accompanying virtues and vices. It is the unique I look for and that is found in the small independent restaurants.   The atmosphere is very much a well worn family restaurant.  The walls are painted a Robin's egg blue, the floors, a faux stone pattern not unappealing, not artsy - adequate. the table tops are well worn with the linoleum transparent in parts showing the base. Untold dishes have rubbed the tops down in places. It's not overbearing just there.   As usual I tested for cleanliness. I rubbed the walls at the window sills inspected the floors. CLEAN. The restaurant is worn but clean. A sure sign that the owners know what they are doing.   The young men that waited on us were humble and anxious to please,  a winsome combination. When I and the Sinaloence entered the room they were busy, a full house. Another sign that the owners know what they are doing. Even though they were busy we did not wait long for food or attention.   I ordered the number 21. Com Bi Cha Thit Nuong.  It is grilled pork and shredded pork on a bed of white rice and a steamed egg. I asked about the steamed egg and was told it was meatloaf. Steamed egg is meatloaf? It must be an idiomatic expression with a lot lost in the translation. It turns out it is not meatloaf but it is a riced up pork that has the texture and feel of a very light meatloaf. The waiter gave me his best food translation and he was right in providing that discription - go figure. The grilled pork on the rice was to die for. The whole plate was a delightful contrast of subtle sweet and savory with the grilled pork leading the way. The rice was perfectly prepared, I mean perfectly prepared. Light, fluffy and pearly white. The rice with the fish sauce continued the sweet and savory theme. I could not be more delighted.   50 years ago the U.S. and North Vietnam had a shooting conflict. The opposing Vietnamese generals made a huge mistake at the beginning of the war. If they had lined up a 5-Mile long buffet table and served the G.I.'s grilled pork on a bed of white rice they would have won the war in four hours. I mean who in their right mind would shoot at someone who can prepare food this good? I know that if I were there I would have set my M-16 to the side grabbed a pair of chop sticks, sat down and asked,  \"More fish sauce please?\"   Atmosphere: 3 Cleanliness: 4 Cuisine:5  Overall an outstanding 4. Don't hesitate to get out of the culinary box and visit Pho 43 Express.",

The staff is very attentive and they explain the menu items throughly.  My husband ordered #2 on the menu and I had their Pho Ga, we also ordered a side of their combination fried rice.  Everything was so tasty.  At the end of dinner Michael one of our servers came to check on us and we started chatting about the history of the restaurant.  He told us that it was a family owned and ran establishment.  He then recommended the taro macaroon with Thai ice cream which was delicious and the most delectable ice cream concoction I've ever had.  We were then surprised with a sample size of their creme brulee and Nutella crepes and that was just as amazing! Visiting this place is a must!",

    "text": "The BEST pho of all time is at 43rd express, and I've had pho from Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco & NYC.  Several other places are good and even great, but none of those places have combined all the elements for such consistently perfect pho as 43rd Express.    It's worth the 20 mile drive to 43rd avenue, just south of Thomas.  Beware you don't go on Tuesday, as that's the day they are closed.  The prices are low and the portions are large.  The Super Extra Large #1 is a steal,  and it also happens to be the most expensive item on the menu, which is saying a lot - you won't find anything on the menu that costs more than $10.    The \"Super Large\" bowl is enough to feed 2-2.5 people, or one seriously addicted pho-aholic.  Their #1 will set you back $7.25, which is plenty for 99% of the pho-eating population.  The #1, features steak, flank, brisket, tendon and tripe.  I ask them to remove the tripe in favor of extra tendon, which they deliver in gargantuan amounts.  This is no ordinary tendon, I've attached pictures to illustrate, but their tendon has great texture with chunks of succulent beef still attached.  Trust me, it's the best ever.    The broth is the best I've ever had, you can tell they don't ever rush a batch, they always have a perfectly seasoned broth with great consistency.  They have a large variety of beverages, from smoothies, salty plum drink, iced tea and sodas to coconut beverage.  There's plenty of variety in that department.  They also have a great variety of macarons for dessert.  There is seating for 50 people, which would be very packed for this relatively small location.  At lunch time it is busy and you likely have a bit of a wait, but never longer than 10 minutes in my experience.    I've only discussed a few small aspects of the menu, but everything here is quality and authenticity.  When you make it to the family owned 43rd Express, you're in for a real treat and a final destination for your pho eating pleasure.",

Every time I go I'm supposed to take a picture for this Yelp review. But I'm always so excited to eat that I forget to take a picture. This place is very busy at all times. That's a good thing though. If you want good food you have to wait a little. Very nice staff it's family operated and they're doing it right and very professional. I always get steak and brisket #10. But once in a while I'll go with the extra large combination #1 which is the Dac Biet Xe Lua. I also always take a coffee to go. Gets me going lol OMG! How can I forget the macaroons!? My girlfriend loves these things! I'm not a sweets guy but I'll take em. With ice cream! Like I said, great place, food never disappoints and great service. These guys are from far away from my home. But it feels like HOME to me. Thanks you guys keep up the nice work!",

My sister ordered the pho dac biet ($6.75) which includes steak and tripe (intestinal lining). We agreed that the pho here was really bomb and that we'd gladly return. The restaurant is kind of a hole-in-the-wall in a semi-sketchy area, but the food is well worth it.  I also ordered 6 macarons because I was tempted by all the yelp pictures. They are $1.50 and larger than macarons sold at other places. They were delicious and very pretty to look at.   I highly recommend this restaurant. The food is delicious and prices are very reasonable.  TIP: Free drink with yelp check-in!",

We got to sample one of her most popular flavors - tiramisu! So many flavors to try. Had to buy a few! I haven't had really good macaroons since I was in Kali.

Throw your preconceived judgements and feelings of the exterior and interior appearance out the window. After dining here twice already, it's the kindness of their service and flavor of food that keeps me coming back for more- you already know that a good portion are their macarons as well!  With the weather a bit cooler I decided to go with the Beef Ball and Rare Steak Pho and a Sam Bo Luong (sweet palm sugar drink with barley, seaweed, dried fruits and dessert beans). Unfortunately they were out of many drinks that day, so I finally settle with a Thai tea.  Yes, yes, yes. Their pho broth is still consistent and lovely as always, aromatic, savory, salty and slightly sweet. Love how they provide a generous helping of basil and bean sprouts. Their rare steak is always tender and the beef balls- I must admit ... my biggest pet peeve is when Pho restaurants have beef balls with the little bits of fat studded throughout. These did not have that at all, yay! Always a large serving portion here that is inexpensive even for a college student like me.  The girl helping us was so nice, to discount the meal since so many items were unavailable which was unnecessary but a great thought. She was also so kind and apologetic, but it was all so understandable.  Free drink off the menu with a check- in on yelp.  If there is a pho place you should try, it's this one!",

It's also hard to resist the macaroon ice cream sandwiches at the end of every meal.   It's been awhile since we had anything else besides our usual dishes, but I'm 100% sure that everything else on the menu is the best Vietnamese food you'll ever have.

I got my free drink with check in (how awesome is that?), iced Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk, which was very sweet, but delicious. Certainly a treat. I had the pho tai (steak), which tasted like a high quality pho with tender thin sliced steak (it even tasted great the second day). The husband got the pork and rice lunch special, which was tasty and came with a great little salad (that I stole). Of course, we had to get an ice cream sandwich... unfortunately they were out of the Thai tea option, but we got taro cookie with pineapple/coconut ice cream.... it was refreshing and delicious.

Also, I used to think BBH was not for me. BBH has been redeemed thanks to 43rd Express. They have now been my standard for comparing good pho to bad pho, for all phos, even back at home.  I always want dessert after Vietnamese food so 43rd Express is a one stop shop. I come on the weekend to stockpile on macaroons and depending on how much room I saved, I might eat two macaroon ice cream sandwiches (go away, I know they are big, but it is that good okay).   From my experience, pho restaurants want nothing to do with you other than you order, eat, pay, and get out, however this family is very friendly; all of them. They are smiling, chatting, or helping you if you have any questions (but for reals, I think if you shut your eyes and picked something on the menu, you will not be disappointed).   My only gripe is I don't like driving in this neighborhood and I think the roof paint originally used to be red, but the wretched Arizona sun has faded it pink... but hey, maybe that is their charm.  Overall, highly recommend. Great portions, great service, great dessert.",

It's a small place, and the building isn't a marvel of architecture, but it adds to the lite atmosphere. The staff was very helpful and friendly, so if you have questions about the menu ask. They will give you guidance, and good recommendations. I always prefer any local hole in the wall and this place just jumped to my top 5. I look forward to my next visit.",

He also took time to explain how to enjoy your pho to the fullest. My highlight was the ice cream macaroon sandwhiches.

On this visit I had the pork fried rice and an order of egg rolls. To be honest the  food was just okay nothing really stood out.  Maybe next time I will try the Pho and  the Macaroons.

The staff is incredibly friendly and prompt.  I usually order the pho tai bo vien. All the macaron ice cream sandwiches are delicious. However, my favorite would have to be the cookies and cream macaron with cookies and cream or dulce de leche ice cream with Cinnamon Toast Crunch topped off with chocolate shell syrup. So tasty!",

I would say everything on their menu is good and on the weekend they serve a special Ice Cream Sandwich Macaroons. I still come here from time to time and order the Super Large bowl of Pho it literally feed 3 people.",

    "text": "This is hands downs one of the best Pho spots in the valley!! It's family owned and operated by the Nguyen family which they rep with pride with their T-shirt's all the way to the parking lot on their vehicles. The service is CONSISTENTLY amazing, polite, fast and most of all welcoming. The only cons I have to report are that they don't serve banh mi and the dining area is small. They are so amazing and popular. I feel they really have outgrown this location, but that's just my opinion. The pros are so countless I could go on for days. The broth just gets into your soul and spreads it's love over your body!!! The prices make it possible to just \"Oprah\" your way thru the menu and feast like a Goddess/God. I swear I always grab atleast 2 apps, at a minimum, before I smash my Pho! With my daughter being Vegan I love how they have options for her and not just veggie stir fry like many others. Even the baby (my 3 yr old) stuffs her face and asks for more. You can't find a more harsh of a critic then those lil crumb snatchers. Unless you're one of those spineless parents who let your kids run the show and tell u what they will/won't eat.   All in all they won me over years ago, and will forever have my loyalty. Thank you guys for feeding my family and I all these years and providing such a palate pleasing dining experience.",

    "text": "Don't be fooled by the run down, small building/parking lot exterior. This hole-in-the-wall type shop was packed when I came here on a Sunday afternoon - and now I can understand why.   The food was amazing. The Pho broth so clear and tasty and full of noodles and meat. My \"small\" bowl was over-flooding with food I could barely mix things around.  I wasn't even able to finish it. But that might also be because we ordered Spring Rolls and regular fried egg rolls as appetizers (couldn't just choose one!) So glad we didn't. The spring rolls were beefy, not just the meat, but in size. The egg rolls were super hot and crispy. I was pretty impressed.   And whats a meal without dessert? They sell regular macaroons and ice cream macaroons. We just got a few of the regular macaroons ($1.75/each) to taste test but these are by far the best macaroons I've ever had.  Servers are nice and fast. The inside was clean, just small. So if you're planning on bringing a huge party, that might not be the best idea.   Environment: 4/5  Food: 5/5 Price: 5/5 Service: 5/5",

The staff was friendly with a surprisingly hipster vibe - it was pretty neat to see a younger set running the place. It had that \"mom you're such a good cook let's open a restaurant and my brothers and sisters and I will run the place\" kind of feel.   I had the pho - the broth was so flavorful with that authentic taste. The crepe was also good and of course we just had to try one of their famous macaron ice cream sandwiches. Yummy!!  I also had the iced ca phe and they made it to order right in front of me. In all my years of eating Vietnamese they've always made it in the kitchen so it was cool to see (and taste!) it freshly made.   I will definitely be back the next time we visit Phoenix. Baby LOVES her noodles and I'm slowly convincing hubs how delicious it is. :)",

Unfortunately, I don't know any known good places, if any, in NYC that do this- so when I knew I was visiting Phoenix again, I made this a top priority to eat.  Verdict? Awesome idea! Why has this not caught on east coast?!! If it is- direct me where to go! I think it's priced very reasonably. I tried the pandan macaron Thai tea ice cream sandwich, and a taro macaron separately. The macarons are flavorful. The Thai tea ice cream was good, but I couldn't taste the Thai tea necessarily. I would love to come back and try other combinations. Call ahead as I hear they run out often.  The pho and summer rolls I also tried were decent and service is friendly. No frills restaurant so don't expect any grand sense of decor.",

They recently started gaining more attention for introducing macarons and macaron ice cream sandwiches (only available on weekends) onto their dessert menu. It's a must have if you aren't too full from your appetizers and entrees! In my opinion, they have some of the best noodle soup entrees compared to other Vietnamese restaurants! My favorite dishes are bun bo hue (spicy beef noodle soup), banh xeo (Vietnamese crepe), and any of the vermicelli dishes!",

My friend found a little piece of plastic in her noodles but they were kind enough to offer to remake it and take her noodles off the bill. The waiters were really kind and friendly, good hospitality. Overall, it was an ok experience but I've had better.",

I could eat it alone without adding any if the hoisin or chile they provide to you. Not one single place I've gone to can touch their broth.  And the crepes!

I had the spring roll, pho, and macarons ice cream sandwich with rocky road ice cream. The rolls were good the flavors and the amounts of the ingredients worked really well together. The pho was good, there wasn't anything that was too special about the pho. However, it is definitely better than a lot of the pho I have tried. Now to the macarons, I have to say that the macarons themselves are great. But with the rocky road ice cream the macarons seem to get lost in the taste of the marshmallows. Nonetheless, I am giving this place 5 stars because of the service and the better than most taste of the food. Definitely coming back, especially when they get the taro flavor back for the macarons!",

    "text": "Before moving up North, I used to come all the time to this place because my family knew the owners and it used to be near my ex-hairstylist. This is where I realized my intense, borderline dangerous love/addiction for Vietnamese deep fried egg rolls. After eating here, no other place could rival 43rd Express. My family and I always got the same things: pho, egg rolls and spring rolls, and a good ol'  rice dish with pork. I remember how I would just stare at the broth that came with the pho, mesmerized by the big and fatty bubbles that appeared next to the thinly sliced beef and beansprouts floating in all of it's glory. I used to drink that stuff up, as unhealthy as I now realize it to be but I believe that we all need to live on the edge every now and then. Big portions, small prices. Unfortunately, my family switched hairstylists and it just so happened to be conveniently next to Da Vang which is where we go to get our fix now because 43 Express is out of the way. Something about hairstylists within a pho vicinity seems to be a reoccurring pattern for us.   Yes, I agree, this ain't no glamorous place. I remember the occasional annoying fly in the restaurant, the non-existent Asian service, how we always had to wash our chopsticks and spoons in water at the table before we ate, and the mis-matching decor but honestly, the crappier the service/decor inside an Asian restaurant, the better it always tends to be anyways. Hey, no one said we were a perfect race.   Get takeout if you're that picky about interior, but technically, if you already decided to make the trek to this sketchy part of Phoenix, might as well just dine there. If you're used to Da Vang, change it up and try this place out if you don't mind the distance!",

And no, it's not just because they sell macarons (which are also the best in my opinion). Before they ever had macarons, my boyfriend and I came in because he found it driving by. We are super attracted to small, hole-in-the-wall places. Of course to set the tone, we had to order their pho. We have never had pho so fresh and flavorful with meat so succulent -- where do they get their ingredients?! Their rice vermicelli noodles with pork and egg roll is also my all time favorite. Ugh, just the best. And let me tell you, we have tried our share of Vietnamese food. You name it, we've probably tried it. And now this place is about the only place we ever go to to fulfill our Vietnamese food needs. Who cares if it's a tiny shack in the not-so-great part of Phoenix?! Not me. And their macarons and macaron ice cream sandwiches, I can talk about them all day. But it's really simple. They are one word: AMAZING. I wasn't into the whole trendy macaron addiction until I came here. When I try other macarons to see if theirs compares, they never do. Shoutout to David and MacaronsbyBinh! I am a huge fan. My boyfriend Kit loves talking to David and loves how passionate he is about the macarons! Thanks Pho 43 for being our weekly pleasure :)",

    "text": "Came here for lunch w/ the family. We ordered cha gio which was alright. It tasted kinda bland so I dipped it in the fish sauce that was accompanied with it. Yeah bad mistake since the sauce taste like it came straight from the fish sauce bottle. The hubby ordered the broken rice with bbq pork, steamed eggs, and shredded pork. He didn't like it at all but ate it anyways since he was hungry. He doesn't usually order stuff like that so that's the only reason why he didn't like it. I ordered the pho tai bo bien. The broth smelled aromatic the way that pho should smell like with all the spices and herbs mixed together but it was maybe a little bit too much since that was all I tasted. I couldn't taste the beef flavor at all. Overall it smelled wonderful but it could have had a better balance in flavors. The bean sprouts, limes, and basils that came with it wasn't too fresh. The lime was brown around the edges where it was cut and the basil was kinda wilted. I gave this place three stars because the service was great and you get a free drink for checking in with yelp. Would I come back? Not likely.",

The food was good, but we werent really paying attention to the food. Then, finally dessert...yay! I got the Pistacchio Macaron and a Red Velvet Macaron with Pandan Ice Cream. They were yummy. They have a variety of macarons from Nutella, Lychee, Taro, Fruity Pebbles..etc. They also had a selection of Macaron Ice Cream and they give you 3 choices for the Macaron shell (Red Velvet, Taro, and Pandan..i think it was) and you can mix and match with a variety of ice cream from Coconut, Mango, Pineapple, Pandan, etc. It was definitely awesome on a hot summer day. Would definitely go back for it. The owners were pretty chill and made sure their guests were well taken care of.",

Eggrolls? or maybe one of the greatest bowls of Pho in Arizona? then head over to Pho43rd .. they have a straight forward menu which is great for lunch, especially for people like me that will read EVERYTHING and take forever to decide.. what i like about this place is the \"express\" it is fast because they have a select menu, that does not mean they have a limited menu, the food is amazing, and they chose the dishes that pretty much maximize flavor and timeliness.  I am not saying do not go for dinner, because you will be satisfied then too.  Oh, and if you savor great coffee like i do, when you order your iced coffee, ask for it in a to go cup =)",

This is hands down...THE BEST PHO restaurant in Phoenix!. Period. It may be located in a not-so-pristine location, but if you're looking for a luxurious Vietnamese restaurant...then this isn't the place for you. Usually upscale Vietnamese restaurants in AZ feature the all-special...Americanized, bland, boring pho.  I can honestly say that I've never had a \"bad\" pho experience here. I'm sorry, but I haven't tried any of their other dishes, because I'm so addicted to the pho.  Be adventurous, try something else on the menu and let me know what you think. As for me, when I need a good pho fix...this is ALWAYS my go-to. :)",

So its a small place pretty basic inside.. A little on the warm side but once you start eating you forget about all that... So my dish was #25 steamed rice with shredded pork and a pork patty which by the way honestly I was slightly hesitant to eat just by appearance but I'm a foodie so I took a bite and my goodness!!!! So delicious! I also had some pork on the side which I believe was grilled and jam packed with flavor! Spring rolls yes please! I was also given a side of soup which appeared to be a broth with green onions I'm not really sure but it was good! Ok so I read the reviews about the macarons with ice cream honestly I've never even had a macaron but I always wanted to try one just cause they are pretty... So I asked for a suggestion on flavors and I got a taro and thai tea ice cream... Goodness it was like heaven! I seriously can't wait to go back again and again... I think I found my favorite place... No I found my favorite place... And I believe I'm going to be addicted to the macroons...",

I actually recently saw a comedy show by Ali Wong and in her skit she does mention that it's not legit unless it has a number  so that's actually one reason I decided to try the place. I've always gone to a different location because it was near my job but I was visiting around the area so I decided to give it a try and I will definitely be back with friends.",

My boyfriend and I came here a couple of months ago and we were starving.  The food was amazing and I ate it all up, but I wasn't entirely sure if it was just the hunger speaker or if my taste buds really were dancing. After our second visit last week, I can confirm that it really was my taste buds busting out the macarena,  Their noodles and meat slices are so fresh and tender.  There's nothing I can really compare it to.  It's just THAT GOOD. They also sell macarons and macaron ice cream sandwiches.  But be aware that it's limited on what they have available and their regular macarons are only available on the weekends.  I was craving an ice cream sandwhich and was sad for a split second when I read that wrong and thought that all macaron creations were only available on the weekends.  Boy was I lucky!  I attempted to share a small bite with my boyfriend, but of course boys never know what \"small\" means.  His bite ended up being half of my dessert!  Next time I'll have to order a second one so that it will be an even split, and even try out different flavors!",

At first we were a little skeptical with the service. It took some time to get our orders in and even have our waters brought to us. But the son of the owner took notice of this and immediately remedied the situation right away, making sure the rest of our time there was spent with attentiveness. Very appreciated! We started out by ordering the Iced Vietnamese coffee. We had two separate orders and they both came out with a teacup contraption and a cup of ice. I studied it skeptically and realized that each teacup had individual espresso dripping for your drink into the bottom of condensed milk- in front of you. So cool! The taste? Strong as hell, and absolutely divine! Next came the Pho. I once told my boyfriend that you can tell if pho is really good in a restaurant if the meat is literally, cooking in the broth. I definitely saw that with some of the meats; we ordered the Dac Biet Xe Leua which included everything: Steak, Flank, Brisket, Tendon and Tripe.  Finally, the infamous macaroons! My boyfriend ordered the regular macaroons, Thai Iced Tea flavored, and I ordered the ice cream macaroon sandwich, Strawberry and Taro. My sandwich was so big, I opened my mouth to take a big bite and hurt my jaw! Um, worth it.  We talked to the son of the owner and found out they had been in business for 20+ years, always busy he told us. His mom found the restaurant and he'd been growing up helping run it since he was a tot.  All in all, our delicious coffees and pho came out to about $20. We were charged for the macaroons separately. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for cheap eats and who supports family business, and lovers of delicious food!",

You can imagine my trepidation when I stumbled upon this gem, only after a mishap of my favorite taco shop being closed for the day (Ta'Carbon). The ambiance is telling of the genuine and palpable nature of the place; the small shop is fairly run down, Vietnamese people lounge outside, and the interior smells of authentic home cooking. The expectations drawn from such a sight are translated right to your bowl/plate. At last, my ardent standards for Pho have been satisfied. I will certainly be returning in the near future.",

He loves the beef Pho and I love the pork and egg roll vermicelli #44 with a Thai tea . We usually get a side of egg rolls or a side of the shrimp spring rolls. With your Pho you get a side of fresh herbs: bean sprouts, thai basil, jalapenos, mint and limes. And for desert you have to try the macaroon ice cream sandwiches they have a rainbow of flavores  you can mix match the cookie with the ice cream as you wish. (Beware they do ask that you pay for the macaroon ice cream sandwich separate from the food). These items are our favorites but their menu has a bigger verity of Pho, vermicelli and rice plates. The building is an old and small building but its clean and the environment is casual. It's family own and operated so it feels homey.  The customer service is great if you have any questions just ask.",

I find that the pho broth at most every restaurant is not distinguishable from another. Others I said this to, agree.  Like can you say that this or other restaurant has pho broth sooooo much better than the others.  Message me where that place is.  I still like Da Vang, but they are closed Weds which is the day I go to the westside to square dance.  But the main reason I favored Da Vang for so many years was cos they were 30% cheaper, now no more.  Been eating at Da Vang since coming to AZ in 1995.

Our sever was very nice and chill at first but it got really busy and it seems like he was the only sever putting in effort because I saw him mainly taking orders...   Spring rolls came out first and it looked pretty good. But that first bite I took, I tasted nothing but veggies and cold vermicelli noodles. The peanut sauce was salty..sorry Pho 43... I wouldn't order it again.   My friend and I both got their Pho size medium with Steak, Brisket, and Meatballs. The pho came out and it smell so good, but the broth was too fatty. It tasted pretty good but the broth was so fatty it kinda gross me out after 4 bites it felt like they pour oil in the soup... the meat portion of the pho was just basic, nothing special.   I also order egg rolls but that came out after the entree.. I reminded the server about my egg rolls that I order for appetizer and he didn't apologize but just said \"its coming out, we got backed up.\" I felt like everything was rushed and our table barely got the attention we needed.   Also the menu was so sticky, and out of order.. it had stains and was all ripped up...   I would definitely give this place another time but not for awhile...",

I've never been here and everything sounds so good on the menu, I was torn.  I asked the kind lady behind the counter which one was her favorite, she said Number 10. So that's what I went with. It was hands down, love at first taste!  The flavors were insanely good.  It was served piping hot and brought to my table within 5 minutes of sitting down.  5 minutes Yall!  This place gets crowded!  I walked in and there were no seats available at all.  I told the lady I wanted to dine in but it's packed so I'll order to go.  She said someone will be getting up in a few minutes I'm sure.  She started to take my order and before she could ask me if I wanted to add a drink, she looked up and noticed 2 women getting up.  I was happy I got to dine in because I wanted the entire experience.  It was a rotating door with hungry and happy customers.    When I got up to pay I saw them bringing out 4 Thai teas to 2 different tables. I said that much be delicious.  The lady said it is.  So I took her advice again and ordered one.  So glad I did!  I live to far to dine here all the time but when in the area I'm definitely heading back to PHO 43. It's the best!",

Service was not up to par though. When I walked in I was warmly greeted and server was attentive upon taking my order, but I was disappointed once I got my meal. I'm not sure if this is a common thing in Vietnamese restaurants because everyone I've been to I've experience similar service, but once my meal was brought to my table the service pretty much went out the door. It's difficult to even get their attention. They just retrieve to behind the cash register or are more preoccupied with welcoming new customers. Not the nicest location either and they only take cash, but I don't really mind given that it's some of the best Pho I've had.",

I think many pho restaurants in Phoenix try to make the dish look dainty and pretty by not loading the bowl with all the great garnishes it's supposed to have. 43rd Express doesn't skimp on their meat, the veggies, the garnish, and have very friendly staff. Price is very reasonable too. I highly advise people to call in ahead of time to check their hours, as this appears to be a family business, and we've seen on multiple occasions where customers are turned away because they had to close early.   Oh and their ice cream macarons are amazing. No matter how full you are, definitely try to squeeze this one in because it'll be worth it.",

If you want something sweet as well you need to get their macarons and their macaron ice cream sandwiches. As like everything else in this family owned establishment, the macarons are made by one of the sisters named Binh. She's a wizard at baked goods and she takes orders for parties or anything you want. She can custom make the macarons as well. It's pretty awesome.   Only place I go to eat pho, period.   Egg rolls are awesome, they have springs rolls 2 ways which I like the bbq pork version but they have the traditional ones as well.   If you have never tried it or wondered what it is you gotta try the Banh xeo which looks like a crepe but it's dericious. Yes I said DERICIOUS!   Bun bo hue is flavorful and on point.   Pork, chicken rice plates are awesome as well, I always get 2 eggs cause #ilovegg  Basically try something new when you come nothing has disappointed me once. This place is affordable and offers free parking as well .",

    "text": "This is one of those HOOD classics that has plenty of business with or without my rating. The pho was very tasty but it was a bit too greasy for my taste. I literally had oil on my lips after each bite because they use fatty pieces of beef in the broth ( I LOVE fatty meat, just a bit too much). The sliced Tai meat was in a big wad like no one took the time to separate. The other dishes were okay. We got a rice plate that my son liked. And the appetizers were okay. It isn't anything I would travel from Chandler for. If you are scared of dirty places like Cali status, you probably shouldn't come here. I think there were about 10 people working in here, none of which were properly uniformed. I just wonder if they appear this disheveled and random, how my food is really being handled.",

The broth is chicken so it tastes a bit sweeter than most pho broth, but nevertheless its very well made.  I didn't taste any MSG in my broth like some of the other pho restaurants I have been to.  Their goi cuon and bi cuon is has less noodles in it which is exactly how I like mine made.  Their macaroon is a huge hit.  It is super fresh and it runs out pretty quickly.    My only complaint is this place isn't closer to where I live.  I been looking for an authentic pho restaurant ever since moving to Phoenix from Dallas a year ago... and it looks like I might have found it.",

But we were quickly greeted and as soon as a table freed up, it was bussed by a young gentlemen.   We ordered two types of steak pho and shrimp rolls. I'm new to the world of pho but I knew this place is something unique.   The guy who greeted us, seated us and bussed and served, as well as wrapped all of our stuff to go turned out to be the son of the business owner. He told us the history of the restaurant and offered to let us try macaroons and even gave us some to take home free of charge. He asked if we had saved any room, he would bring over an ice cream sandwich.   I can't believe it took so long for me to come here but I can't wait to come back!",

I've had a lot of macarons and this is the best in the valley. The macaron itself is perfectly made from a pastry perspective- no crinkles, not hollow, and perfect feet. The ice cream isn't homemade but I didn't expect it to. And for a large macaron at $3.50, not a bad price. I'll definitely be back for that.  As for the pho, I have not had it myself but my family says that it is average but they would not return for the pho.  THat being said, definitely  come here for the macaron sandwich. It's crazy that in this ghetto cinderblock looking restaurant, I found the most perfectly delicate and expertly crafted macarons.",

But the pho itself was where the 3 stars come from. For me it was too sweet and felt like it lacked something. The chicken was too chunky (usually not a problem for me lol.)

Food taste OK, but I still prefer our regular pho place at 19th Ave and between Camelback & Campbell (for yummy deep fried spring rolls, better variety of food and prices).    $$ One thing I must mention is the bill total seems overcharged a dollar or two for some reason, I am not sure whether they charge for the bean sprouts that serve with the noodle soup.  Since they don't provide paper receipt, so I requested an email receipt but it only show the total amount, not showing detailed charges so I have no clue why I was charged extra.

It also came with some sauce and some soup....The guy there was super helpful in explaining what the sauce was for. The yelp offer for a free drink was used on the coffee and it was so good! Served with a cup of ice to pour it into and enjoy. Which I definitely did. They did have one fried rice, which I was debating on but decided on my meal based on everybody's reviews saying how amazing it was. And it was pretty good. I took half of it home and had it for dinner (it was a lot of food) The total came to $8.40 which is a little higher than most places I've been where I have had drink and food come to that... I will likely be back, and hopefully save room for the cookie sandwich next time!",

I mean it really easy to see when driven by I guess it's because of a huge Pho 43 sign, so definitely can't miss that. The parking lot is small. I saw people park in front and on both sides of the restaurant. The day we went was quite busy, but luckily we got a parking spot. Inside the restaurant was also small and everything looks old. Tables and chairs seem to have a sticky feel to it. There's a couple of leaking on the ceiling in the middle of the restaurant where they put the bucket there.   Service was fast. We got seated right when we walk in. My boyfriend got the pho dac biet and I got the bun mam. He said the pho was good although he still prefer pho 602. My bun mam was delicious. I know bun mam supposed to have eggplants in it too but this one doesn't. I don't know it's because of different region vietnamese that makes it differently, but I love the broth. There's a kick of spicy to it, which gives more flavors.   Honestly, they need to upgrade their restaurant so it look more cleaner and nicer. Other than that, I love the food and would definitely come back again to try other dishes.",

It was perfect amount if I only had one omelette.    Grill pork rice was pretty basic, I would prefer it a bit hotter and more crispy.  It seems to have been prepped and cooked already keeping warm for the value lunch special.    Banh xeo was very thin and crispy, light and refreshing with a good ratio of mung bean sprouts, pork, and shrimp.  Shrimp was cook well, juicy with a crunchy plump texture.  Fresh veggies in a heaping pile, and nuoc cham for days.    I hope to be back for their pho, which would be my ultimate tester for any pho restaurant.

I remember the first time I try Vietnamese food that was 20 years ago and it was at PHO 43 the owners that run the place now were little kids back then , they use to take orders and help with the tables , that's the kind of place I love and Let's all  support family owned restaurants , real people that cook with passion and a little bit of homemade, they have been consistent with the flavor I have tried different dishes but still my favorite is the clear noodles pho, com ga nuong , and Vietnamese spring rolls. Also for drinks the pineapple juice it's a winner for me their jasmine tea pretty soothing.  Also you know what the prices are very good and portions of the pho are big",

    "text": "Not just one of my favorite, but my all time favorite pho spots anywhere. I've been coming here since I first moved to AZ in 2003 and I've tried so many places throughout the valley. Here, there's no BS \"premium\" meat choices and no BS unnecessary garnishes or plating; this puts their price point absolutely perfect to match their amazing flavors.   If you like pho, it's because of the umami of the broth and the perfect consistency of the rice noodle, which pho 43 does very well. Let's be real, when you slice a meat so thin for pho, it doesn't need to be a tender cut like filet or rib eye. Besides for the thai meat, all the other meat options are always cooked to perfect consistency.  Beyond the pho option, everything just tastes damn good. The broken rice options, the vermecilli, egg rolls, spring rolls... you just can't go wrong. To top it off, they have great macaron and ice cream macaron. Everything is just damn good.",

    "text": "Definitely one of my favorite pho places in Phoenix. I just recently came here with a friend and I haven't been here in a while. A family run and owns this place. Small store but has very good business. It's a very typical Vietnamese restaurant with the interior. The outside looks a little run down but that's how you know that's legit pho. Service is really friendly and fast!   I always get the Pho Dac Biet ($6.99 for small) They come in three sizes. Small, medium, and large. I got the small and I feel like their portions are really big. I could barely finish a small bowl. What makes them stand out is there dessert selection.   They offer handmade ice cream macaroons (Macaroons By Binh) and regular size macaroons. Depending on the day and what they have in stock you can choose different flavor of the macaroon, the ice cream and the topping. I got the Red Velvet macaroons with Thai Tea ice cream and fruity pebble toppings ($3.50)  This place never disappoints!",

Now on to the good stuff, I tried a #11 Tai Chin Nam - steak, flank and brisket. The flavor is tasty and delicious. The service is also on point and the food comes out quick!  On the weekends you can find macarons, which are absolutely scrumptious!",

The broth itself has a great flavor but I still like to add my hoisin sauce and sriracha. Just a preference of mine. I would have rated the place five stars but the atmosphere brings it down 1 star. It is definitely a \"hole in the wall\" type of place. Also, this place is really popular during lunch time so get in early or you may have to wait to get in.

    "text": "I honestly don't even know where to begin but since we've moved here from Cleveland a year & a half ago we have tried almost every place. I learned not to trust Yelp! all the time because everyone has different taste pallettes. Anyways, we've been to a lot of places but 1 that didn't seem to let us down is Pho Thanh on 17th & Camelback. Not bad. Great prices. Service is mediocre & the food is decent. Not the best we've had but better than all the other places we've been. Well the same friend that recommended that restaurant to us had found 43rd Express & told us about it. We trust his judgment because well, he hasn't let us down yet. He was right. It was very tasteful. I didn't have to add or \"remake\" my soup at the table like I usually do. I ate it as is. Sidenote; growing up, my mother was and still is the number 1 cook. And no, I don't say that because she is my mother but so does the rest of the world that has tried her food. So she made it very difficult for everyone else because nothing will ever be better than her cooking. Anyhow, this place however didn't fall far behind her. We ordered the #1. Since we were sharing we decided to go with the Super Duper size. Good & bad idea. Bad because it was way too much food and we couldn't even get halfway through. Good because we have leftover but usually it wouldn't be as good. We also ordered Banh Xeo (vietnamese crepes). For the price, I couldn't believe we were getting 2, for the whole order. But even more surprising,  it came out to taste even better than it looked and it looked pretty amazing. The nuoc mam (vietnamese special sauce) was so very good as well & i have never in my life found any other restaurant that I was actually satisfied with their sauce. I mean, that sauce is everything. To me anyways. If it's not good, it's just not satisfying. We also had goi cuon (Vietnamese spring rolls ) and those were pretty good as well. Overall, if I could give it more stars I would. Before you leave don't forget to try the macarons. Oh they were delicious. We had it Togo but it still didn't make it to the car. To end my long book story here, I just want to add that the service wasn't all that great because the females seem to have a problem. All but Cindy. Now she is all the more reason why I would even love to come back because she was amazing. She is very friendly, personable and beyond helpful. We enjoyed conversing with her. She definitely held it down and she gets her own 5 stars.",

    "text": "This place is great. It's so hard getting a decent authentic Asian meal in West Phoenix but this place sure does make it way easier. Me clearly fitting the stereotype of a rebellious teenager, I ditched my study group and decided to stop by this joint. I live 2 minutes away from this place and I'd passed by several times paying no attention to it, partly the placement of the location was very odd (in between a daycare and a Mexican Market). This place just kept bugging me. Eventually, I decided to Google it to see whether it was legit or not. After reading several reviews I was convinced; I NEED TO TRY THIS PLACE OUT. I literally walked into the place and asked \"hey, I'm new to this place, what do you recommend?\" The owner (didn't catch his name, unfortunately) instantly gave me options; his best recommendation was the pho. I had never eaten pho so I immediately ordered it. I soon took a seat and was handed some water. In what seemed no time at all, my food was served. The actual pho plate was huge and kind of intimidating; it was accompanied by basil, beansprouts, and lemon slices on a separate dish. The owner gave me a quick rundown on how to eat pho. He explained the sauces and how to break up the noodles at the bottom of the place and just the basics. The food is amazing. The beef in this dish was delicious, noodles were perfect, and the addition of the sweet sauce made this experience one I'll never forget. At first, due to my horrible hand-eye coordination, eating the noodles was a bit tough but as soon as I got a hang of it, I couldn't get enough. Surprisingly, I was expecting the check to be around $15, but it was only $6. This place is totally affordable. There is no excuse for someone not to stop by. I definitely recommend and encourage anyone in the area to try this out! Its the best Asian food I've had. I've eaten at other Asian places (ie. Kabuki at Tempe Marketplace) and though their food is also good, their hospitality isn't. Not only does Pho 43 Express have great food, but also polite, patient, and understanding staff. Thank you so much for allowing me the pleasure of eating here. I plan on stopping by again soon.",

    "text": "It pains me to write this review. I agree with most of what the Yelpers have to review. My family and I live very far away, far north phoenix yet we would make the trek down south to Pho 43. We've been coming here for over 10 years.Saw it when the mom ran the place and before the remodel. We drove all that way because the food was really good and authentic and flavorful and the amount you got for your buck was a lot of bang. My mom is an extremely picker eater and has only liked one dish on their menu, I don't remember now. It's seafood based and has fillets of fish in the soup. Also takes a lil longer to make. For the past 10+ years, they have had this dish available. The last several times we have gone they tell us they are out. We tried to give them the benefit of the doubt thinking ok, a weekend has just passed, or it's still early in the day. But when you go at such random times and days and they continue to be out, we suspect, it's a dish they are no longer making. Which is fine, then take it off the menu or tell your customers. Because we go in expecting to order something and for it to not be available is quite disappointing time after time. Each time my mom has had to order something else to which she does not care much for. The shrimp soup and the presentation is awful. All there is, are 5 little shrimps floating around the bowl. That's a lot of money for a bowl of noodles. My dad who is not a picky eater at all and does not complain much about food because he never had much as a child. Even his go to staple, number 1, he said had diminished in quality in regards to taste. The prices were raised which is understandable with the way the economy is, but then don't skimp on the portion and make it obviously so. The quality of the food has seemed to go down a bit over the years as the younger generation took over the restaurant. There seems to be less attentiveness meaning, we've gone in and there are plates all over the tables and no one has bussed them. We've been eating our meal and I can see the staff sitting around and looking on their phones and there are dishes and plates all over the tables. I think it's exciting to have new items like the macaroon ice cream sandwiches and a hipster-esque feeling to the place, but as a long time customer of Pho 43, it's a little disappointing to see some of the other changes.  We have ceased driving all that way to Pho 43. No sense in doing that when we know we will be disappointed in their lack of availability for some of the dishes.",

Unfortunately, the food is not good and that's ultimately what it comes down to. Pho was way too sweet, which overshadowed the complex aromatics of a truly good broth. Bun bo hue was pretty awful. Tasted like fish-sauce water. Grilled pork on the vermicelli dish was wafer thin and dry. And they use a lot of coloring on their meats which makes the food look less appealing. Banh xeo had nice crunch but only had a few small shrimps inside and I don't remember seeing any pork at all. Vegetable accompaniments were each lacking something authentic to the dish. I did not try any of the macarons, but we were given crepe samples which were ok. Free drink with yelp check-in if you want to try some new drinks. I might come back to try a macaron, but not for the Viet food. Hate to be a food snob at a mom-and-pop place, but as Vietnamese food becomes increasingly popular, I'd want people to experience the real deal.",

Service was better than comparable pho restaurants, ambiance is very....authentic.....to most \"authentic\" Viet restaurants.  Had David as a waiter, and he made small talk and recommended the XL Pho Tai, which was a great deal considering the sheer volume of pho I ended up getting. He was kind enough to make a special half-order of egg rolls, and the food arrived quickly.  The bowl was ENORMOUS, and hot. The noodles were fresh, the meat was the correct type and sliced correctly. The broth was perfect, actually had onions\\green onions\\cilantro in it, and had all the correct side accessories (I didn't have to ask for a spoon, Hoisin, sliced peppers, lime, etc).  Egg rolls were on point, not refrigerated for days on end, and the filling was on-par with the real deal in Little Saigon.  I made small talk with David about the area and found out his parents own the place, and his recommendations were spot on. Well done! I will be back.",

If you're the type that eats with your eyes and needs to break the piggy just for a meal to feel like what you ate was good then by all means come to chandler for your viet food fix.

I eat a lot of Chinese food and Dim Sum, so I'm kind of used to eating authentic stuff (no Panda Express!). I had a rice dish with pork topped with a fried egg! It had fresh garnishments and it came with soup too. OMG! It was so good! It was very inexpensive too, maybe $6?  There were other Asians eating there and that's a real good sign of gauging if a place has authentic food.  The service was friendly and cordial. Excellent!  Anyhow, don't let the look of the place scare you away, as well as the neighborhood either. I can't wait to return!",

One serving was too much for me, they include alot of meat and veggies. With the yelp check in I also received a free drink, I chose iced coffee with condensed milk. Very good and strong. I ended the meal with an red velvet macroon and panden ice cream. The macaroon was the best I've tasted! Definitely a good place for a quick lunch/dinner.",

The family that owns the restaurant treated me and my family likes their family for our first time. They even messed up on my vietnamese coffee and gave me another one for free, they even gave us a few macaroons we were curious what they tasted like for free! They claimed, those ones were \"broken\" ha, sure. Anyways, the food was great, flavourful, and made with great ingredients. I am coming back.",

The owner of the restaurant came to our table, told us that was not the proper way to talk to the waitress.  When I wanted to reply, he raised his voice and came aggressively close to me.  His voice was so loud that everybody stopped talking. Their food is good but not superior to any other local Vietnamese restaurants.  We definitively do not recommend this restaurant.",

Unless you plan on being at this restaurant 2-3 hours before they close do not count them having what you want. My spouse and I travel 30 minutes in 5:30 traffic (and haul ass) just to get there 2-3 hours before they close, and they on countless occasions tell us they have run out. Talking with one of the staff members about this issue, I've learned they only make one pot of broth per day. Here's a really great business tip, BUY ANOTHER GOD DAMN POT! Moving forward in examples, my father in law, to avoid disturbing another guest, grabbed a sriracha from a different table, and was told by the owner \"what's wrong you don't know how to share?\" Now let's be honest a restaurant that brings in plenty of revenue (from their one pot) should have a setting for every table. Again moving forward. You can't even ask for a fucking fork with out feeling the heat from a dragon like huff and puff! 43rd express is again the best pho in Phoenix, unfortunately because of their vile customer service I won't wast my gas time or money on this establishment. I strongly suggest the employees research a local seminar on customer service, myself and I assure you many others, think that it will be to your utmost benefit! Thank you.    P.S we have found another pho location in the Peoria area and thankfully they have more than one pot.",

When I pulled into the parking lot I thought to myself, \"I wonder if this will actually be any good\". When we walked in and every table was full (this was on a Monday at 1:30pm).  We ordered the spring rolls as an appetizer and Pho Ga for our meal. The pho was awesome!!! The best Pho I have had. After we ate we watched another costumer order a macaroon. Neither my mom or I have ever had a macaroon before so we thought we would give them a try. The waitress explained what flavors they had left and even let us \"Sample\" the Pandan (Green) and Taro (Purple). They were so good we ordered a few extra to take home.   If you are looking to try a good Pho restaurant look no further than 43rd Pho Express.",

I never liked fresh spring rolls but this is an exception. Their pho is definitely the best in the valley. It's so flavorful! I didn't finish my pho so I took it home. It's still good the next day. I checked in and I had free drink! Too bad that they don't have fresh coconut when I went there so I tried the vietnamese coffee. It's on the strong side.  I love their macaron ice cream sandwiches! The flavors that I wanna try is not available so I settled on red velvet macaron with caramel ice cream! My husband tried the red velvet macaron with rocky road ice cream. Can't wait to go back and try more macarons!!!",

Mixed veggies with pork, crab meat, whole shrimps sitting on top of deep fried noodles drizzled with the tastiest sauce; cant be beat anywhere else! Best in the west phoenix! Service is amazing.

I've tried ice-cream macaron sandwiches from  famous places like MILK in LA, and macarons from multiple upscale bakeries like Sucre, as well as macarons in Paris where it all started, and these are still my favorite!! Not only have they nailed the chewy consistency, but their flavors are the most unique that I have seen anywhere. I love that they also have an Asian twist with flavors like Thai tea and taro, and my all time favorite flavors are the taro and fruity pebbles! When you get the ice-cream sandwich it is also customizable and you can build it with your choice of cookie, ice-cream and dip that you want it rolled in, where the options are mainly cereals like Cinnamon Toast Crunch and fruity pebbles. I absolutely love this place and have been coming here for a long time for walk-ins and for special orders! They've made designs like elephants, pigs, and turtles for us, and they're always so easy to work with, so go support this lovely local restaurant!!",

The saying \"you don't know what you're missing\" comes to mind when I think of everyone who's not had one of their a macaron ice cream sandwich.  Never had the pleasure of experiencing Phoenix best macaron?, then get here, now. Unless that is, you've been here before, and if you've been here before and not had their macarons, I don't feel bad for you, I feel sorry. Sorry that you didn't order the best macaron you'll experience in Phoenix. With flavors like strawberry ice cream, taro ice cream, and Oreo cookie, the ice cream alone is delish, but they combine their home made ice cream with amazing macarons to form Ultron, defender of the universe. But seriously, it's a friggen macaron ice cream sandwich.   It's rare that I head west for anything gastronomically delightful but this is just one of those places. If death must find me west of central phoenix, let it find me at 43rd express with a fistful of macarons and a mouth full of ice cream sandwich!! :-)  Happy yelping!",

    "text": "My fellow yelpers didn't let me down with this recommendation. This hole in the wall from the outside joint is legit.    I hadn't had pho in like months.  Since the weather \"cooled down\" a bit recently.  Now was the right time to find an A+ spot for Pho in PHO-enix.  Pho 43 is one of those spots that's not in some pretty strip mall but in an area I was told is not the safest at night.  I suspect this place is jam packed on the weekends, but I swooped by on a weekday!  So therefore service was never an issue.  Michael who ran the place when I ate there, checked in a few times and was chill.     I could smell the broth as soon I walked in.  Cue the angels singing.  Everything looked great on the menu but I came for what I like to refer to as the Super Burrito of Vietnamese cuisine!  The Pho Dac Biet Xe Lua.  Holy sh*t, I even saw they have a Super Duper size option!  Daaaayum!    I just stuck to their \"XL size\" and when it arrived to the table...the soup was filled to the top rim of the bowl.  Like seriously one wrong move and that piping hot soup would've spilled over.  These folks at Pho 43 are dangerous AND I like that!    Broth is great just the perfect amount of star anise and seasoning , generous chunks of brisket were on point as well.  My only regret is that I forgot to ask for the rare sliced beef on the side.  I like to throw those in the broth once it comes out but luckily they weren't well done thankfully.    Quality and quantity.  Best of both worlds.  Overall an outstanding bowl of pho.  Next time it will be bun or banh xeo AND macaroons on a weekend trip back to the 4 3.",

The reason I'm not awarding it five stars is because the service could be a tad bit friendlier/better not once did we get asked if we needed a refill my mom was trying to wave a brother down for some water. The restaurant is family run and very humble the parking lot can be a pain the restaurant itself is tiny including the walk ways but at the end of the day your money is well spent the macaroons I've had here are the best I've had in my life so creamy and perfectly chewy and not too sweet their flavors to those macaroons are a unique Asian twist and those famous macaroons sold in that fancy Scottsdale boutique are a far-cry from these homemade babies. Goodness it's been 5 days since I've been here and I cannot stop thinking about them. The pho is delicious as well very well balanced and spiced. Two steak and briskets phos/order of spring rolls and fried pork rolls with 2 drinks and 6 macaroons will set you back at 45 with a tip included. I will definitely go again I'm hoping their service improves but it's not a big deal it's family owned so more power to them. The food is that good. I will continue to come as long as I don't have any bad experiences here.",

I'm always SO excited when I discover another restaurant that serves bo cuon la nho: grilled grape-leaf spiced beef rolls. This dish holds a very special place in my heart, as I've been eating it ever since I was a little girl. It's somewhat hard to find; I only know of 5 places in the AZ valley that serve it.

We had already eaten lunch, so just came for dessert.. Of course, I had to try their macaron ice cream sandwiches.. I was sad that there were no traditional macarons available since it was a weekday... Anyways.. My kid enjoyed a red velvet macaron with birthday cake ice cream rolled in fruity pebbles. I kept it Asian with taro macaron and pandan ice cream.. So yum! I've had macarons and macaron ice cream, everywhere.. First time with these flavors, yum, so good and with a nice taro/pandan flavor!... The macaron texture I thought was just a bit on the soft side.   I'd love to try their food the next time I'm in town...  Service was quick, straightforward, and friendly enough for such a small fast pace restaurant.",

It was packed and busy, and had enough sitting for 10 small parties.  Every time I get Pho, I make sure to get brisket and steak and an order of crispy egg rolls. The trip was definitely worth it. The broth was traditional, heavier with onions versus other places I've gone too. Ingredients were all fresh and food was definitely served hot. The egg rolls were very crispy and delicious; if I wasn't so full, I would've ordered more.   I didn't get the chance to try the Macaroons by Binh, but will definitely come back. Make sure to get there early as it get packed. Staff was very nice and friendly.",

I only wish they added ox-tail to there PHO.  Overall! Price is great $ very affordable and best PHO",

    "text": "A combination of pho and macaron ice cream sandwiches? Sounds like a win-win situation. My sweet tooth was ushering me to give this place a try after seeing all the tempting macaron photos. The exterior of the building was on the shabby side, and certainly not located in the best side of town. Once I stepped into the restaurant, I knew they served authentic Vietnamese food. There was the traditional garnish for pho laid out on the tables: chili peppers, bean sprouts, limes, and Thai basils. They even have the little sauce dishes for the hoisin sauce and sriracha conveniently placed at each table.   I had the pho tai chin (#10) regular size, which was the beef noodle soup with steak and brisket. The broth was average, not too salty with adequate flavoring. I wished they trimmed the fat on my meat better as there were pieces of pure fat attached, which I had to literally remove myself. Maybe I have been spoiled by other pho places that have their meats nicely cut.   There is a separate menu for the macarons and macaron ice cream sandwiches. They offer three different macaron flavors for the sandwiches: pandan, taro, or red velvet. The menu had a lot of ice cream flavors crossed off, so we were limited to only three ice cream flavors and 2 added on special flavors (b-day & black cherry). Initially wanting to try the rocky road, I settled for the pandan macaron with thai tea ice cream. The pandan macaron was delicious! I can't say the same for the thai tea ice cream which lacked that wow factor. My boyfriend also had the pandan macaron with strawberry ice cream, and wasn't impressed with his ice cream as well.    The service could use some improvement. While we were dining in, all the workers were busy eating their mid-day meal/late lunch. No one was doing rounds to check up on the customers to see if they needed anything. We had to physically get up and approach them because they were so occupied with their meals; it felt like we were disturbing their mini break. It would be nice to have at least one person be open for full service.   They have affordable pricing, and accept card. The food was on the mediocre side, nothing spectacular that would pull me back. If I was close to this area, I'll probably stick to Pho Thanh on Camelback for my regular dose of pho. I might stop by to try their macarons again.   Remember to do a yelp check-in for a free drink!",

Showed up and were greeted and seated.  Everybody working there was very friendly.  Ordered dinner (I got my usual - bun with grilled pork and egg roll with a ca phe sua da, the gals ordered a crepe and a noodle bowl).  While we were waiting, I struck up a conversation with David about the Macarons.  We had a good time talking with him (the gals make Macarons at home, so process discussion, etc.).  Ordered one of everything to go, and 3 ice cream sandwich Macarons as dessert.  Back to the food - the bun was very good - everything was fresh and good (and not stingy with the pickled carrots, etc.).  My wife really liked her crepe, and my daughter dug the noodle bowl.  Good stuff!  Then, dessert - the ice cream sandwich Macaron options are 3 kinds of cookie, and 8 or 9 flavors of ice cream.  We each tried one of the cookie types (Taro, Pandin, and Red Velvet) and 3 types of ice cream (Taro, Pineapple/Coconut, and...I forgot).  They were all really great.  Great food.  Great people.  And...the only Vietnamese restaurant I've found that's open on Sunday (when you get a ca phe sua da hankerin' on Sunday).  Check them out!!!",

Some giant asian dudes serving some giant pho bowls.  They probably played football or something and their magical pho powered them.  The egg rolls were quite favorful.  Love the rice meat egg dish as well.",

    "text": "Pho 43 hit the spot. Do not be sketched out by the appearance from the outside. This is a prime example of why the architecture does not equate to quality. This is a family-owned establishment. The brothers and sisters run this restaurant with the highest quality of service. At arrival, there is an entire team to give the biggest welcome. Waiters and waitresses were speedy to take the orders and bring out our meals.   I had to satisfy my caffeine crave, so I got the Vietnamese ice coffee. If you haven't had Vietnamese coffee, the coffee came in a coffee press and filter that drains into a cup with condensed milk. Once completed, you stir and pour the coffee into a cup full of ice.   We had ordered the spring rolls for appetizers. These large spring rolls were filled with the freshest vegetables and meat. It came with a flavorful Vietnamese peanut sauce to perfectly compliment.   I had the #10 Tai Chin, Pho with steak and brisket. The dish comes out in a large bowl with noodles, meat, pho, and broth that filled to the rim. On the side, they supply plenty of sprouts and basils for you to add on your own. They also had all the essential sauces on the table that you would need to eat pho -hoisin sauce (my favorite), sriracha, and chili. Steak and brisket were prepared in thin slices, tender in texture. The broth quenched my savory tooth.   If you have a sweet tooth, you better save room for dessert. The macaroons comes in different flavors and you can pick different kinds of ice cream with it. We ordered the taro macaroon with cookies and cream ice cream. Let's just say they're worth your calories. Note: The Macaroons are only sold on Friday, Saturdays, and Sundays because they're own by a separate vendor.   Go ahead and consider me a regular to Pho 43 now. I am convinced that I have found the best Vietnamese Restuarant in Phoenix.",

The pho has nice flavor and the best part is it came out piping hot. However, the meat was little dry and the tripe was way over cooked to a point it was slimy :(. The bean sprouts and herbs came out very fresh and clean. The crepe had nice crunch and was delicious. I wish the dining room was little cleaner too. Most of the tables were out of napkins but they were packed for lunch.  I think the best part of this restaurant is the dessert. The macaroons were quite tasty. The taro root ice cream macaroon (don't know why it was green) was not so sweet and was very good. Most dessert was in the shape of hearts in celebration for Valentine's Day. I'd come here just for the dessert. Three stars for the food but extra star for dessert.",

If you're the type that adds sauces to your pho do yourself a favor and try it without them before you go crazy with the Sriracha and hoisin. There's no way any less than 10 hours goes into getting this bowl to your table. Take a moment to enjoy it as is.  Oh and about that table, you may have to wait. The place is cozy and welcoming but at about two o'clock in the afternoon on a Saturday there were no tables available. The wait is worth it.  Do not leave without taking a look at the macaroon menu. The PB&J, green tea, and birthday cake macaroons are insanely good.",

I mean it is dense!! Like a big black rope. Duh what did you think I was gonna say? But no seriously the noodles are long and heavy it will fill you up pretty fast.   Reason I gave a 4 star and not a 5 star review is because.....welll..... I don't like long thick noodles lol. Everything else is great though!

They go by a different name every where I travel so figured I would describe them. Anyways, the broth is good, meat is good, price is good.  Hits the trifecta in my book.",

I told them it was my first time visiting and I just got a blank stare and was handed a menu, no offers to help or anything. Since I have read on here that the service is great, I was a bit disappointed. I am willing to chalk it off as \"just one of those days,\" so I will try again since the food is great.",

The Pho broth is very good, one the best tasting of many of the Pho restaurants I have visited in Phoenix Metro.   The restaurant is very unassuming and not fancy at all. I believe is was a Taco Bell from days gone by.  The family works together to make the restaurant work. The food is fresh and very good.  They are great at recommendations or explaining items to you if you need a bit of help. Take the opportunity to ask questions, step out of the box and try something new. I go there to get my Pho fix.  They also have great espresso they import by way of California, it is very good.  They make a great Viet Coffee with it. They appreciate loyal customers who appreciate their small family business.   Give this place a shot, you will enjoy it.  Update: You have got to try the various flavors of Macaroons that Bihn makes.  We took two boxes of various flavors home, they are terrific.   They were once only available on the weekends but now you can place and order.  Look for the sign near the door or ask inside.",

    "text": "It's been almost a year since there was a review about this place.   I thought this place was pretty affordable and cheap compared to other Pho places here in AZ. Large portions too.   I had their #15 Pho, meatballs and sliced beef. The broth tasted like chicken or like those Pho broths from the can you can buy at Asian supermarkets. I pretty much drowned it with hoisen and chili sauce just to make it almost taste like the Pho most people know. The bean sprouts they gave us were kind of dry and still had the \"little brown roots\" on the end. Never saw that before in a restaurant. The meat didn't look too fresh either.  The restaurant is on the small side, but is spacious. I found the Boss Lady sitting at one of the back tables facing the whole dining area a little creepy. Their waitress looked like she just woke up and rolled out of bed! Lol. Omg, a minute into having our food served, I heard someone clipping their nails! I was tempted to look around but I was afraid I would totally lose my appetite. Gross. Do that at home. Not at your restaurant.   I'm not so sure if I would go back. I probably only will if I was really really REALLY craving for some Pho, and it's the only one near my work.   They are closed on Tuesdays and is Cash Only.",

    "text": "My first time dining here and it is probably the best pho in town and the best I've had in a long while. Walking up to the restaurant, I was a bit skeptical as the outside appearance does not quite match what was inside. As we walked in (I went with a friend who had been before) we picked a table and sat down. The waiter was over promptly with menus and water.   The place is on the small side, with maybe 10-12 tables in total. Each table comes with most things you will need like chopsticks, chili paste and hoisin sauce. We decided to get the fried egg rolls, the spring rolls and my friend went with the rare steak pho while I opted for the chicken. We were told sadly that they are out of the egg rolls so we did not get to try those.   The spring rolls were served quickly and were delicious. They had the standard filling of shrimp, lettuce, cucumbers and rice vermicelli with a side of peanut sauce. They tasted fresh and flavorful.   The pho arrived shortly after that. Their portion is rather large so make sure you go hungry. It was accompanied by a plate filled with sides (sprouts, cilantro, limes, jalapenos, mint). The meat was tender, the noodles were perfect and the broth beyond amazing.   Everyone at the place was extremely friendly and polite. Overall, the atmosphere was just as great as the food. If you're looking for great food for a great price and very friendly people, I would definitely recommend 43rd Express.",
