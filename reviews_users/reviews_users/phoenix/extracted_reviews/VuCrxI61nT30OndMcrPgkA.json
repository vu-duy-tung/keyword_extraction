I frequent this place on occasion and earlier this week I had forgotten my charger plugged in to a power strip near the entrance of the coffee shop. Realizing at 9:30 PM that it was missing I called but no answer as they had closed. The next morning I called and spoke to Jessie, who refused to walk over to the table that I was sitting at in order to check and see if my charger was still there. He said\" there's people sitting there and I am not about to interrupt them but feel free to come in and look for yourself\". I thought he was joking, but he wasn't. So I did, drove 20 minutes just to see that my charger wasn't there, at no fault of the coffee shop but a very inconvenient scenario could've been handled with a little bit of effort on Jesse's part. Hopefully the owners are reading this and will have a little talk with him about customer service. I'll still go to this place because it's a nice working environment, coffee is good and the rest the staff has always been on top of it.",

The bartenders where outgoing and gave excellent customer service. They were very engaging and pleasant.   The only draw back for us was finding a table was very difficult.  We noticed many tables that had 1 person utilizing a large table camped out, laptop open and earbuds in, which was not cool when trying to find a spot to sit a party of four.  Also, why would you have your earbuds in when there is live music? Rude to the performer.  I will go back again as the atmosphere, food and staff were excellent!  The only reason why it did not get the 5 stars was the seating.",

It's got both indoor an outdoor seating although it was definitely too hot to be out there. They have table, bar, and couch seating.   The espresso was good but as the day went on I realized they offer flights of beer. So I decided to try three of them. When I was talking to the guy at the bar, though, he really didn't know much about them. So I just tried 3 random ones and wasn't disappointed.  After the beers, I felt like I needed some food, so I got one of Sip's homemade soft-pretzel. It was amazing. It comes with either mustard or cheese and the mustard was great. It was the perfect snack with either coffee or beer.  I can see how sip can easily transition from place to work into a place to drink. This is a great little local spot for either of your caffeine or alcohol fixes.",

Bottom line, don't waste your time. Terrible parking to boot. Waste of a Saturday afternoon. I guess if your a cool hipster this place is for you; but if your looking for an alternative to Starbucks thats local and awesome, McDonalds is better than this place.  Greatly disappointed!!!",

It's a self serve place with a silent cash register person who makes you feel like you're ordering at a fast food place.  It was Sunday at 12:20, and the singer/guitarist was so loud, it was impossible to get far enough away from speakers to be able to converse with your friends.  Possibly a good place to go if you're alone and want to stay that way, but terrible if you have guests.  Never going back.",

They somehow struggle to find friendly staff that have good customer service skills. I always have to ask for happy hour pricing because they don't offer it up until you ask, and even then, they never seem to ring it in. They also don't list the prices for beer so you can easily pay $9 for less than a pint of beer, plus tip. As much as I may complain, I'll continue to go back for the cool venue space and the relaxed environment. Bring a book, laptop and/or some friends and enjoy the reggae music.",

Staff are not particularly friendly (or unfriendly - don't get me wrong) but you won't get the corporate overly-cheerful vibe from most of the ladies who work here.  I swear the music they play is directly tapped into my iTunes (think alternative, reggae, beach-y sort of tunes).  Seating is a hodge-podge of brightly-colored folding chairs, plastic chairs, and your rescued grandmother's flowery armchair.  Mixed around are an adequate supply of outlets to charge up your devices.  Parking can get a bit tight (to say the least) but you can park along the side of the building - well, lots of people do, anyways, and I've never seen a tow truck spring into action.  I'm sad they don't do tamales anymore, but the food is surprisingly good - and reasonably priced as well!  Last, a testament to this place is that all the patrons are friendly, up for a brief chat if you REALLY need a work break, and happy to move their stuff or offer an outlet if they see you've been off-power for some time.",

I really wanted to try their breakfast sandwiches and was very disappointed that they were out of both everything bagels and pesto. I settled with an iced coffee and a bacon, egg and cheese with greens and aioli instead. The coffee was pretty standard, nothing to write home about. The bagel sandwich was a sloppy wet mess. It was impossible to eat because it did not stay together. The aioli had much too strong of a sweet lemon flavor, which did not complement the contents of the sandwich at all. I ended up cutting it all up and eating it like a bagel salad, but I still could only finish about 30% of it. Hopefully their pesto dishes are better when they can keep it in stock!",

I have yet to try any of their coffees or beer. Tea is good, but it's hard to mess up iced tea. The atmosphere here is nice. They had live music when I came in the other night so my friend and I opted to sit outside where we could talk. Even though it was about 100 degrees out, their misters were awesome and I didn't even notice the heat. Love the lighting outside and the seating area.   My only beef with this place is the food. Each time I come here they are always out of what I want to order. And whatever I do end up ordering is never that spectacular. The parking is also pretty crazy and I usually end up having to park a couple streets down. If they stepped up their food game I would probably frequent this place much more often.",

It was perfect and definitely hit the spot.  I also love how they have a huge jug of ice water sitting out to enjoy.  That was pretty perfect after I finished my tea.  The hubby and I both ordered the breakfast sandwich and shared a blueberry muffin.  The muffin was delicious and the sandwich was pretty good as well.

    "text": "Thanks to Timothy B.'s review on Sip Coffee & Beer Hourse (woot, woot -- shoutout!), I bookmarked this little spot a while back, hoping that I'd be in the south Scottsdale area and have time to swing by and check it out. Well, yesterday I did just that; and I'm glad I did!   I walked in and immediately was like \"woah, this place is awesome!\" The decor is simple yet sophisticated, it's very chill (the people and staff), and everyone was incredibly friendly. I only had a little bit of time to spare, so I didn't go all out and splurge on any pastries or their beer selection (afterall, it was only 11am... on a Monday. haha). I asked the barista what he recommended -- and he told me that basically anything is wonderful. One item on the menu caught my eye though -- the Kevlar coffee -- and I asked what it was. The barista explained that it was coffee with grass-fed butter and oil to get you those good yummy fats your body needs (and probably craves!) He did such a great job at explaining that I was sold! Got the Kevlar coffee in an adorably cute red mug (don't mind my mug obsession... lol).   I sat outside since it was an absolute beautiful day, and the sweet barista brought my coffee outside for me to enjoy. The Kevlar coffee definitely hit the spot, and although the barista said I might think it's too buttery/greasy, I thought it was smooth and creamy, and absolutely delicious!   I really enjoyed stopping by -- wish I would've had more time to try some of their yummy food items... but that just means I'll have to stop by again... and soon!",

    "text": "Great place to grab a coffee or beer, or both... And/Or a snack. Breakfast is great. I love the idea of all the happy themed activities (open mic night, rock and bingo) but have yet to check them out. The morning/afternoon coffee vibe is relaxing and mellow. Not sure how it is in the evenings, but can't wait to check it out. Overall, this place has a similar atmosphere to the original orange table, which I really liked before it changed owners. I realize you have to pay more for local, but the only thing keeping me from going with five stars for SIP is that I think the prices are slightly inflated only because they are selling local products. I'm ok with that in general, but at some point there's a limit to how much one can reasonably charge for a fairly common item - like a bagel and cream cheese.  Check it out, it's worth a stop, and the coffee easily rivals corporate coffee across the street.",

The building itself is cute, rustic, and a bit on the hip side. There is plenty of seating inside and it feels open and spacious. The decor is fun and I love their sliding barn door. (I want one in my house.) I visited on a Saturday morning and while the place wasn't too busy (maybe three tables full) the parking lot was full. That is the one major downside - not enough parking spaces. The other downside was that the service was slow. I came in for a quick drink to-go but it took well over 15 minutes to get my drink. The barista was perfecting a latte before mine and then the process of making my drink (a hot vanilla latte) took at least 10 minutes. Believe me, I watched him the entire time. The drink was delicious and I do appreciate the art of coffee making, but I just felt it could have been a little... quicker. Fortunately, there was a guitarist inside playing tunes and that added to the ambiance. Overall, it was a good experience and if I'm in the neighborhood, I'd definitely come back. This place does more than coffee and I'd like to try their food menu.",

It's open and airy with different table and chairs, couches, and outdoor patio space with misters. -great chai tea lattes  -great breakfast sandwich that had egg, bacon, arugula, creamy cheese, and a tomato type jam on it.   Now here are the negatives that are swaying me to not give this place another shot.  -customer service was pretty sub par. I ordered the breakfast sandwich and asked to have avocado added to it. Avocado was on other items on their menu, so didn't think it would be a problem to have it added. I was fine with paying any up-charge. When the server brought the sandwich to my table he verbatim told me \"The owner wanted me to tell you that for future reference, Avocado isn't an option that can be added on the breakfast sandwich but we added it just this time\". Well jeez thanks for the telephone relayed message but I already paid the extra $2 for it and it wasn't like I was asking for something completely outrageous like foie gras to be added. You had the avocado already, it takes 30 seconds max to slice, and I am paying you the up-charge price of basically the cost of 2 avocados for a few slices.... -their iPad check out kiosk tipping buttons are tacky. I have been in the restaurant business. I understand tips are important but to have remarks like \"15% uhhh\" \"20% thanks\" \"30% we are buying you a beer!\" Is just not called for. Especially at a coffee place where they are screaming your name to pick up your latte when the place is 80% empty and give you a lecture on avocado.",

My wife and I shared the Bruschetta for only $5!! This place is awesome, I would recommend stopping in for a coffee at 8am or for an awesome drink.",

The place is usually hoping with a variety of folks, most engaged in what look like meet ups with collaborators, clients or friends. The music is always upbeat.   I usually get a tea, they brew the teas on the spot. It takes a few minutes but well worth the wait. You can order salty or sweet snacks if that's what you are looking for. The staff is always ready with a friendly welcome, and bring your beverages to the eclectic variety of tables and chairs. There is even a sofa to relax in.   There is a large selection of beers on tap for that that want something stronger. From what I can tell by other's reaction its always tasty.    There is a little meeting room of sorts in the back corner, I've seen at least eight or so people fit there is that is something you are looking for.",

    "text": "Scottsdale needed this place badly - or perhaps I needed this place badly since moving from Phoenix to Scottsdale! Little dose of hipster, lovely tastes for a foodie, laid back vibe, chill employees. These are the things you find all over CenPho, but a rare breed East of 68th street. I plan on spending many weekend afternoons here drinking day beers. The decor and open layout make for a very inviting atmosphere that begs for both happy hour banter and solo study time.   The menu is small and simple, but everything looks and sounds amazing. The kale salad was light and refreshing without being overly doused in dressing. I would however recommend more chickpeas as there were only about 10 in total. My hubs loved the hummus sandwich. It came with chips and slaw, and while I typically love vinegar based cabbage slaws like this, this one was average. We both indulged in the peanut butter cookies which definitely satisfied our sweet craving. I can't wait to try that cinnamon coffee cake with a big cup of coffee soon.   The beer. Whoa. What a selection! I enjoyed a Lil Sumpin' Wild on tap which never ceases to amaze my mouth. I hope they start a loyalty punch card soon or some kind of beer club, because I'd be all over that. They do have a couple of wines by the glass, so fear not - all are welcome, including canines. The patio is dog friendly, so we of course brought our pups who loved the attention. With such a terrific concept and execution overall, I have high hopes that this place will thrive and pull in a fun crowd!",

Excellent selection of beers on draft, and good prices -- happy hour before 7pm takes a dollar off the pint. My biggest complaint is the music -- it tends to be a bit loud during the day (I understand on Friday or Saturday night, but 2pm in the afternoon?), and one of the employees there exclusively plays reggae music... and plays it constantly. Doesn't vibe well with the atmosphere; it's Scottsdale, not Jamaica or Long Beach. I can take reggae in limited doses, it's fine, but it gets really old after a while, especially at that volume, and makes it difficult to concentrate without having to put in headphones (which most people seem to be doing). That said, very very chill place, definitely check it out",

Note the stars on the menu may mean it's either only avail on Saturday or Sunday or that it's limited quantities  Other than that chill vibe decent tunes and the beer list could be somewhere in Colorado kinda expensive but such is Scottsdale   There's def a normal crowd or a lot of people just know each other",

They are regularly out of things or the kitchen is out of service (e.g. during my last visit they shut down the kitchen for 45 minutes in the middle of the day because \"there was a big mess\").

But I'm a little irritated at the sarcastic comments that accompany the suggested tip amounts on the iPad square payment screen and the little poster designating the tip bucket at the register. I gave 20%, which was $2 and some change... yet I'm not sure for what. I ordered a sandwich, came with a salad and a glass of water. They were out of My first menu choice, the bruschetta and out of bacon that should have been on my second choice.    The wait for food wasn't too bad, but no water and no fork. So, I go to the register to ask for \"missing items\" to learn it's serve yourself over here by the sugar packets and nutmeg.  so, what was the tip for, exactly???  As for the food, the lettuce (\"salad\") was drenched in olive oil only and the sandwich was average, at best. The boys behind the counter were really not even that friendly.   So, before you get up in arms at my knocks on their customer service, I spent years in the service Industry and still remember what it's like to actually earn a tip.... this was not it. Another reason why I don't believe in tipping prior to service. Shame on my guilt for allowing it to happen!!!",

I sipped a caramel nonfat latte in a red ceramic cup, which tasted great. Gained some energy for shopping later. Definitely a place to sip something and hang out.",

The line was very long but as I said it was Saturday morning. It is possible that someone didn't show up for their shift but I would definitely suggest two people at the counter.  My cold brew was very strong and it was really enjoyable. Since I had been out and about, I was going to order a bagel or muffin. That changed when the girl in front of me ordered a muffin and found that the bottom was covered in MOLD. While I was waiting for my coffee, I noticed that the rest of the muffins that were sitting out has green, fuzzy mold covering them. I alerted the guy behind the counter. He didn't seem to care and said \"Yeah I'll get to them.\" Personally, I would take care of moldy food sitting right in plain view of customers ASAP. They lost a sale over it!",

I tried AEROPRESS and fell in love with the taste and smoothness of this style of brew. They had a live solo musican playing coffeehouse type of music (guitar and voice), it really is a nice touch and great way for local musicans to jam and get exposure. I love how they had the windows open inside and allowed the natural air to come in. They also have an outdoor patio, board games and light bites. Unfortunately, I looked up them up before I visited and saw that they offerred tamales, however; that is not the case anymore in which I was disappointed. They need to update their on line menu!! I tried the BREAKFAST SANDWICH, it did the job but there was NO roasted tomato vinaigrette in it instead there was MAYO- yuck. I didnt feel like complaining as I was slightly hungover. The crowd is a mixture of athletic (yoga girls done up and some that are just there  for the coffee not the scene), couples and lots of university students. Its fun to watch everyone and get your coffee buzz on.  Loved their coffee and the vibe!",

Thankfully, they were right!   I brought my books and my laptop here to study. Upon entering, it was the perfect noise level. The music was relaxing and enough to drown out the crowd without disturbing your studies.  I was amongst those on dates, working lunches, and delving into a good novel.   It was as if my coffee house dreams had come True.   Their menu consists of craft brews, a few cocktails and wines, coffee of all types, and lunch items. It was very inexpensive compared to most coffee houses that I frequent. The sandwiches looked light but satisfying, although I did not get to try one.   Forget the library, this is my new sanctuary!",

It just tasted horrible.  I took it back and asked for my money back and they couldn't have been more rude to me.  For a place that calls themselves a Coffee House, you should be able to order an iced coffee and drink it black. I will say I've gone here many times with friends and ordered either tea or beer and was satisfied all other times.  I was looking to have a quiet hour away reading and ended up leaving very disappointed.  The two workers didn't apologize and made me feel as if I should have drank the coffee as is.

And to be very frank, I was completely surprised that I loved the Iced Cartel Americano.  OK, I 've had Americano at Cartel, and I SWEAR it doesn't taste nearly as good!

The coffee is fresh and delicious and they have an incredible selection of beers and wines on tap! The baristas are incredibly nice and social as well.

Fresh air, laid back and productive people here, a good selection of coffee and drinks, and a coffeeshop playlist that has a nice balance between background and rainy day tunes.   Give this place a try if you want to try a nice spot to sit out on the patio with a pup, get some work done, or relax with friends :)",

The hazlenut latte I ordered was well presented and tasty and the back patio was pleasant enough with not alot of people clogging the seats after 9am. It was about 4 bucks for the latte and I even glimpsed a hummingbird. It almost reminded me a country meadow, until the DB with his daddy's BMW came cruising into the lot.  UPDATE: Cinnamon Coffee cake thingy was stale. AVOID at 4 bucks. Hummingbird Garden has been trimmed too.",

We ordered a sandwich to share and two beers (loved that they had Mother Road Tower Station on tap).  We ordered the Italian and went to the patio to soak up some sun and enjoy our beers.  I was waiting at the bar for the sandwich when a guy brought it out and said they had made the wrong one but would I want that sandwich as well.  Sure! I said.  Hubby and I began to eat it when our \"Italian\" sandwich arrived.  After the first bite, it was apparent that it was not the Italian that we had ordered, but the BLT.  Oh well, we said to eachother.  We didn't feel the need to complain even though we both couldn't beleive that they got our order wrong twice.  As we were eating, someone finally brought out the Italian we had ordered in the first place.  Third times' a charm I guess!    We stopped in for coffee on a bike ride a few weeks after the sandwich debaucle and thought the drinks were pretty standard.",

I haven't had the food but the coffee is beyond wonderful.  My favorite is the cold brew iced coffee with carmel and almond milk. The atmosphere is wonderful, cool art and laid back vibes.   They have plenty of seating both indoor and outdoor.  The staff is also very friendly and fun.  If you have any questions just ask them!!  One thing I must say is they seem to be hiring new staff and  some employees (baristas?) really rise above the rest.",

Meet up with friends for some local brewed coffee or sip on a local craft beer. It's as good as it gets, interior and exterior is always wonderful I love the aesthetic of the place. Not so hidden, but it kind of is in the beginning of heading towards south scottsdale / old town scottsdale. You pay for what it is because taxes are already included. Haven't tried any items from the food menu, but drinks are wonderful and the service is pretty great from what I seen, I went on a Sunday and it was pretty packed with people doing work, hanging out and meeting up with friends, so it's a well known place. Definitley will be coming back!",

    "text": "In a way I feel like I should wait before reviewing this place. I stopped in here at about 10:30 on a Friday night, which is right before Sip closes (they technically close at 11, but they stayed open a good 20-30 minutes past that when I was here), but everything was so awesome in that short amount of time that I'm gonna go ahead and give them five stars!  I've been wanting to stop in here for awhile, and too be honest, I've mostly wanted to stop in the morning or afternoon for a coffee and/or food (and I'll be doing that at some point!), but the opportunity presented itself randomly on a Friday night so I stopped in for a couple beers.  I loved the atmosphere. There's lots of space (both indoors & a patio), with comfortable chairs and couches. The staff is extremely friendly & outgoing. Since it was near the end of the night there were only a couple people working, but the guy working behind the bar (I believe his name was Alex...for as much as we talked to him I really should remember) was very outgoing. He seemed to know a lot about both the beers on tap & bottled beers & made my friend I was w/his own whiskey concoction, which she really liked. Speaking of whiskey, I was actually surprised this place even served liquor (I believe they only have whiskey). I just assumed they were beer & wine, but apparently they're not.   Like I said, I really need to try some other things here to get more of a feel for this place, but I really liked what I saw & tasted in the short amount of time I stopped in for.   One last thing I should point out that I really like about this place is the hours. I actually LIKE that they close early (compared to bars). They attract a different crowd because of it, and if you're only looking to have a couple drinks it's a good place to start the night or just catch up with friends for a bit.",

Being a True southern girl I enjoy some of the cozy decor that reminds me of back home :)   I work out in the field for my job so I often like to find local coffee shops to work out of. (That are NOT Starbucks) Not only is this place cozy and welcoming but they have great food, plenty of seating and AMAZING coffee.  When I get iced coffee they serve Cartel Coffee on tap, you can't go wrong with that. When I'm in the mood for hot I get the Bulletproof coffee! So excited to see a coffee shop serve this! (I spy a crossfitter!) What's that? You don't know what bulletproof coffee is?? Well you must come order a cup! ASAP!  it makes you feel bulletproof! Good for those dreaded Mondays!   The breakfast frittata is the only breakfast dish I've had thus far..it's served with local eggs, haus bacon, spinach, Swiss cheese, organic arugula tossed in pecan pesto & roasted tomato vinaigrette (I got it without the 9 grain bread) and it was fabulous!!!!   They have an awesome dog friendly patio with lots of seating (for when it's not 500 outside). Unless you are one of the odd balls who enjoy the desert summer!!?  And their schedule hosts some live music, open mic night and music bingo, along with trivia coming in the future! Sounds fun!   Only downside is parking is a little scarce so you may have to park in the Walgreens or staples lot and take a short walk over. And when I ordered the pretzel It was good but just a little dry. Other than that no complaints and I will continue to set up shop here :) thanks for bringing a great local coffee shop to the area guys!",

How about a shitty attitude to remind you of why you should have just taken the time to eat a bowl of cereal at home instead of paying someone else to make you some breakfast? Well, have I got the perfect place for you!  Nestled in a corner spot where parking is nearly non-existent (Unless you rode your fixie!!) you will find this completely stereotypical ode to the modern beard laden barista bar designed with stupidly overdone \"vintage\" fonts and upcycled wood bullshit.  Anyways, I asked the guy if could make a flat white. He goes on to essentially mock me and try to educate me on how \"You mean like a cappucino, yeah no no they just learned how to properly steam milk and we do that right anyways\". Dude, I just asked if you could make a flat white after asking how you were doing? What?  Sensing how difficult this was going to be, I went with a cappuccino. For the record, flat whites are microfoamed, less foamy and more velvety milk...versus more frothy and airy bubbles in everything else. I asked for a flat white and if you could make one. Yes or no will do.   In the end, it wasn't a good coffee. They use Cartel which I use at home so I can't fault them.  I also ordered an avocado toast (cliche I know but I was in a rush) and I think it was like $8?   After finishing my coffee, which took about 10-12 minutes, there was no sign of it. I went to the counter and said \"Just wanted to check on that toast, it's been a while\". Also of note, it wasn't very packed and didn't see numbers on anyone else's tables to speak of (to denote they ordered food).  Verbatim response \"Yeah food is going to take 10 or 15 minutes, this isn't a fast food restaurant\".   My response. \"But, it's toast?\"  It took just shy of 20 minutes.   It was a single piece of bread, not even two.  It wasn't even toasted.  I can't even.   Newflash, you aren't a sit down goddamned Michelin starred eatery you jackhole. You serve breakfast items, sandwiches and snacks which by all accounts may not be \"fast\" food in the vein of certain chains but it should certainly be fairly rapid and a single piece of bread with some fucking spread on it THAT WASN'T EVEN TOASTED HOLY SHIT YOU DO KNOW WHAT THE WORD TOAST IMPLIES WHEN PAIRED WITH BREAD MEANS RIGHT OMG AHHHHHHHHHHGGGGGGG shouldn't take 20 minutes. Are you high? Probably.   First time, last time.",

There are tables both inside and out, where you can get some work done. However, My one suggestion with Sip and most other coffee houses, is the lack of outlets. I realize adding outlets can be expensive, so run some cords!",

They have really comfy chairs for socializing, high top bar seating as well as some more standard tables as well.   I had their pesto breakfast sandwich and was very impressed. However it's not listed on their website menu so be sure to check the menu they have on the counter before ordering to see all the options.  Based off of other Yelp reviews I tried the Kevlar Coffee, thinking it was just a brand name coffee. It's not. Apparently it has butter in it, and there's some science behind it as to how it makes your energy last longer. Wasn't my cup of tea, (get it? ) but apparently it's a thing now so just beware!   Definitely want to try going back in the evening to try their beers. They have Firestone Walker on tap, one of my favorite central coast breweries, so I can't wait to go back!",

Sip Bar has a few locations across the Valley and this is their original. They are all about bringing the coffee and beer crowd together under one roof. They have about 20 beers on tap alongside their large selection of bottled beers. For coffee, they use Cartel coffee and serve up a variety of espresso drinks, cold brew and teas. In addition to coffee and beer, they have a light menu that includes sandwiches, salads, breakfast and a cocktail menu. The best part of this place for me is the atmosphere. I come here a lot to read or meet with friends. I get a lot accomplished whenever I stop by and at the same time I get a great cup of coffee. The staff is great! They are always super nice and will answer any question you have. If you want to sit outside, the patio area is nice and shaded. Thanks Sip Bar for creating a great space for us quiet busy bodies that appreciate good beer or coffee. Definitely check out happy hour from 4-7 or some hear some live music in the evenings. There's usually available parking spots behind the building on Bishop Ln. Old town Scottsdale is just a few blocks away if you are up for a stroll after your beverage.",

    "text": "My first time here. I have been hearing about Sip and their pastries for a year or so and just hadn't made time to come (actually, I did try once and there wasnt anywhere to park so I kept driving).  Today (a Saturday morning), a friend and I came for coffee and a pastry for a light breakfast. I was instantly taken with the atmosphere. I love vintage! Most everything there is from long ago and kept looking that way. Lots of wood and metal. I also love the choice of indoor and outdoor seating as well as an open wall window (if weather permits) bar seating that looks out onto a tree lined area of Scottsdale road. There isn't much of a menu, which is fine. It's  beer, coffee, \"sammies\", and pastries. I was rather disappointed at the offering of pastries as they were not what I was expecting. I thought they were handmade by a local baker I had met a year ago, but what was presented was smaller, less appealing and packaged in cellophane. So, I ordered a drip coffee and breakfast sammie instead (prices were reasonable, about $10). I was able to order the bagel sandwich how I wanted.  Service was good and friendly at the register and our coffee was given to us there. It took a while to get our sandwiches and they came out at different times but, tasted good.  There is a lot of table space to meet friends and visit or sit with your laptop. There are also many areas/choices on where to sit. I also noticed signage for an open Mic night if you're interested in that. Overall, we had a good experience and would go back.",

    "text": "Updated (from 2 to 4):  I go here a lot now and sometimes the music is still a little too loud to concentrate or have a conversation, but it is better.   Simple but tasty eats, wide range of beer on tap.   Original review:  First time there and initially I liked the vibe and decor. And I like Cartel coffees. It's hip without being Scottdaley but also not like other places like Cartel.  But like Anthony, I agree the little details can make or break a having a good time or a disappointing one. For me it was the environmentals that didn't work.  Like most hip coffee joints, they played the music about two notches too loud which  made it hard to just enjoy being there and do some work I had planned on my computer. The WiFi worked fine but it wasn't protected - these days it is nice to have at least basic password protection in a public place if only for piece of mind.   The A/C was about 5-10 degrees too cold (I'm not generally sensitive to cold/hot). I tried sitting in a few different places but there was an arctic downdraft  wherever I sat. I don't normally talk to management in situations like this because they are going for a certain vibe and changing it once for a single customer isn't the point.   They could have had me for several hours sampling noshes and beers if the atmospherics were just a bit towards the comfy-cozy side to  accommodate more intimate conversation and creative thinking. Granted young kids might not notice a thing.  I'll stop by again to give it another chance or two and adjust my review accordingly.",

There is a small parking lot, but not many spaces. With the other restaurants popping up right next to it, I can see that parking will be an issue in the future, if it's not already.  I loved the decor. They did a great job with creating different areas to sit and different type of sitting and interactions. The outside is nice. Although it's very 'hipster', it's super clean. I LOVE that. One thing I don't like about Cartel is that everything is hardly staying together. It's very dirty there. But Sip is great. They have a nice beer selection and coffee too.   We had a breakfast sandwich, breakfast burrito, iced coffee, and a cinnamon swirl cake. The cake was AMAZING. May need to stop by during lunch to get it again... or every day =]  The burrito was good and although unusual to add sausage, it was nice. I liked that they gave you tomatillo salsa (could be tangier) and sour cream. Tomatillo salsa doesn't get enough credit.   I would give them a 5 if they didn't have cartel. I find their beans to be sour and not the freshest.   Will definitely be going back here again for group nights and lunch during work. I would also like to go during the nights they have open mic and music events. That's one thing I miss from Tucson- coffee shops were a place to meet new people and learn something new. Kudos, Sip!  Their kiosk is also cool. Looking into doing the same thing for my business.  I had planned to take a photo of the cake but it was gone before I could snap a photo! SO GOOD.",

We ordered a cocktail, a pretzel, and Not Your Father's Root Beer. Average price, great, friendly service. The misters outside make for a cool(ish) summer night. The live music tonight was okay. Will come back for coffee and company, or maybe a good book.",

We drove from Ahwatukee, so it took us a while and we passed it a few times before finding it! It was crowded so we had to wait for a seat to open up! We got three coffees there and they were awfully strong (we like ours a little more sweet) and we each ordered some food. There food was awesome! The one thing I didn't like was how long it took for it to come out and than when it did my burrito took an extra 8ish minutes by itself. Other than that I'll remember this place if I'm ever in the area! Best of luck to the owners!",

Didn't try the food or coffee, which I will come back to do soon but did enjoy having one of their beers on tap. Also, the staff was awesome and very welcoming. They didn't have high chairs for my little one, but offered to go get one at one of the businesses next door.  Looking forward to my next visit there",

The breakfast offerings are minimal and a bit over-priced in my opinion for how small they were.   I'm still a bit perplexed on the idea of this place... Is it a drink place with just a couple bite items? It's it a coffee lounge to bring your laptop to? It's not a restaurant... It isn't a breakfast spot or dinner spot. I dunno maybe I will have to go again to figure it out.",

    "text": "I absolutely LOVE this place. I have never seen anything like this in Arizona, it's exactly what Old Town needed. I love walking in and looking at all of the furniture and decor, everything is so unique and eclectic, it's all so original and different from what everyone else is currently doing. It's really cool that they have butcher paper set up as a suggestion wall and chalkboard in the bathrooms-love those ideas!  I had the breakfast frittata and now I crave it for lunch and dinner! Payton Curry, the chef who makes their food, is a True master at his art. I grew up going to big farmer's markets every week so I appreciate that everything is local and organic (and not to mention delicious)!   Cartel provides their coffee beans and anyone who knows their coffee knows that Cartel roasts the BEST beans in AZ. I saw that someone in a previous review complained about price, but if you know coffee, you know you're getting what you paid for. Plus they have kegged iced coffee!? Didn't even need cream or sugar!  They have a very extensive craft beer menu and serve flights in muffin tins, awesome! The walk up cooler is a great idea too! It's nice that they have a set cocktail menu. You don't see that really anywhere in Arizona, I've only seen it in places like New York and Seattle. They take a little to make but it's so worth the wait considering everything is hand pressed, muddled, and mixed right in front of you.    The staff is extremely friendly, I enjoy going to a new spot where you don't see the normal or typical \"Scottsdale\" employee. It's a breath of fresh air.   This is such a great place in all aspects. I'm making this the official place I meet my friends for coffee, food, cocktails, and beer spot!",

    "text": "Coffee shops are notorious hipster hangouts, but I don't need to tell you that. This is more basic than Starbucks, and should be obvious to even the most amateur hipster watchers. But Sip is home to something so special and unique that it is drawing hipster watchers in from all around the Southwest: the elusive \"South Scottsdale Hipster Bro.\"  While the South Scottsdale Hipster Bro hasn't been officially classified yet in the Before it Was Cool Hipster Almanac, rumors have it that peer review is pending and will likely be complete within the year. An official designation will probably be a boon for business, as it will likely draw even more hipster watchers from farther afield. Sip already has a reputation among Hipster watchers, with the largest documented population of this unique endemic varietal of hipster in the lower 48. At nearly any given moment at least one or two hipster bros will be present - a treat since most Hipster Bro sightings in the wild occur with only a single specimen. Visiting hipster watchers will find this group viewing a treat, as Hipster Bros only produce their unique vocalizations within close vicinity of another Hipster Bro.  What it is about Sip that acts as a draw for Hispter Bros is yet unknown. The decor may be a factor. It is hypothesized that the shabbychic furniture reminds the Hipster Bro of his old frat house, providing him with both comfort and a sense of home, while the vibrant colors and excellent spacing appeal to his sensitive, artistic soul. The mismatched plastic cups may remind him of the cheap plastic cups he still occasionally plays beer pong with, and they also help him hydrate so he can later hit the gym to work off those coffee calories. And while the decor may be partially responsible for the influx of Hipster Bros, Sip's draft selection is also a magnet for HBs looking to smash a few craft brewskies with his bros. Like sugar water to a hummingbird, Sip attracts Hipster Bros with the opportunity to swap beard grooming techniques, order mocchiatos the way their made in Italy, and hit on some fly-ass honies. Clearly they find the combination of all these elements irresistible, and the result is a stunning concentration of the South Scottsdale Hipster Bro.  Come enjoy this off-the-map Hipster watching mecca before the word gets out it gets ruined by the crowds. You'll be delighted to see bro hugs between men with beards and skinny jeans, and nothing beats the thrill of hearing a craft IPA-drinking Hipster Bro talk about taking his vintage 1978 Schwinn over to a girl's house and totally banging her even though she was a 6.  You'll love it if: you want to see the South Scottsdale Hipster Bro in an unspoiled setting You'll hate it if: you have a phobia of beards and displays of overt, aggressive masculinity",

I did not know that it was counter only service. I DID know that they are dog friendly which being a big animal lover with 4 dogs that lives in the neighborhood is a big deal for me. I will throw my hard earned bucks to local establishments like this! I decided to go in today with one of my dogs and tried to get service which at first it was ok. I got a younger gentleman in which I was able to get his attention, then an older guy (Bryan) that I have seen my one other visit there before took over the bar area. Since I know I cannot walk in with my dog I tried to get his attention. Bryan saw me but obviously decided best to not ask me if I need any help or anything at all and talk to some folks (probably regulars) at the bar area and JUST IGNORE ME. I went back to my table upset and disappointed. I wanted to stay and have another drink and even order food but I decided against it. I expressed my feelings to him on the service. I told him it was an opportunity lost on their end. They had my card on hold as I was planning on staying longer and I asked for it back. He did comp me and I was appreciative of the fact- just wish it did not have to come to that.   I will give them another try...just hope the owner reads this and knows customer service is EVERYTHING.",

I'll try to keep this short:  Pros: -Cool aesthetic  -Cool concept  Cons: -Service. Consistently poor here. It's odd. There is no sense of urgency from any employee, and while I like the laid back style, at some point it shouldn't take 10 minutes for an iced coffee to be prepared, with no line ahead of you. On each and every visit, it was just a shit-show of service. On two occasions, and owner was sitting at the bar, either talking to friends, or another time a vendor. As the line grew from one customer, to four, finally the owner got up and started helping his employee, who was clearly in the weeds. Listen, I get that you have to order stuff, and take care of the business side, but if you ignore the paying customers who are right there- then soon you won't have a need for vendors. I say that with all due respect, and I hope the advice is heeded.  -Products, so the iced vanilla latte (three of them) never had any vanilla flavor that I could detect. All three occasions I couldn't detect any vanilla, and while I don't need to be clubbed over the head with flavor- a hint would be nice. I had some coffee cake which was super dry, to the extent that it should be served with a red flag warning. I tried to order pizza one time, but then saw the person in back lean into a freezer to pull some component out to heat and serve. I quickly cancelled that order- if you can't do fresh- don't bother.  In closing- I want this place to succeed- the Dale needs indie places, but they MUST start paying attention to detail. If they don't do that, and get a sense of urgency- this place will close, and all their hard work will be for nada.",

    "text": "I was a little hesitant going to a coffee shop in Scottsdale, but was surprised by the friendly staff.   First off, the parking situation is less than ideal. There were hardly any customers inside and still no parking available. I arrived on a Monday morning to get homework done, and luckily there were quite a few tables and free wifi. There's plenty of patio seating, and the decor is colorful and eclectic in the best way.   I ordered a cold brew which was a tad more acidic than I'd have preferred. No worries. Next time I'll spring for a latte because I'm definitely coming back. A friend and I shared a breakfast sandwich and it seriously hit the spot- like a fancier deli style bagel sandwich. We paid $6 for it so the prices weren't too steep.  I will definitely come back to grab a latte, maybe a beer (their selection was really impressive).  Overall: Iffy parking, great decor, friendly service, good food.",

The staff was really friendly and helped me choose some new beers to try, which I did. And they were stronger than I usually choose, so the music started sounding even better and suddenly I was having an even more super time with my friends. Decor is \"garage-like\" lots of metal and cement, lots of light and patio on the side. They have great breakfast menu. Its a beer/coffee bar so I will be back for the coffee to bring me back to life after too much of the strong beer that I tried. We had a good time. I am not going to fault Sips, but to people with infants, don't bring them to bars during happy hour when a band is playing. Even better, don't bring them to bars, period. Red Robin better choice, maybe even Chili's...",

This espresso is smooth and tasty.   I'm on the keto lifestyle so I got a breve latte as a breakfast treat and it was freaking delicious! So glad I took the time to stop in and get one!

Sip is one of those places that is always filled (and often packed) with people studying, working, congregating, reading, meeting, or otherwise doing the things that people do in coffee shops.    When I first came here, I didn't realize that their food menu was so extensive.  The drinks are truly fantastic... and like it's sister location in Arcadia, large espresso drinks are quads, which means four shots of espresso!  That makes the caffeine-addict in me quite happy, since I almost always order my drinks that way anyway... so no upcharge to do that here!  I most often opt for the cafe mocha latte... and it is perfect.  EVERY TIME.  Consistency is not overrated... and is actually the biggest factor that separates the successful restaurants from the not-so-successful restaurants.    On my sixth or seventh visit, I realized coffee alone was not going to get me through a focused work session, so I ordered some food.... the breakfast sandwich with bacon to be exact.  Let's just stop right there and reflect for a minute.  I had been here some a half dozen times or so and had never ordered this incredibly incredible sandwich before... WHY OH WHY?!?  It is SO GOOD!  I had wasted six or seven days of my life by not eating this amazing sandwich before this visit.    If you have not yet been to a Sip location, then get over there and enjoy this local staple of the Phoenix area today!  *****FIVE STARS*****",

My cousin and I stopped in this past weekend. I ordered a chai latte with soy, we found window seats, and we spent the next few hours chatting away! It seems like a great place to grab a bite to eat or to sit and study. I will DEFINITELY be back... gotta try one of their draft beers next!",

A snappy response about how here are no mediums in SIP lead to me ordering a 16oz. After paying, she took a while making the coffee. When I saw she was going to steam the almond milk I let her know that it was ok just to pour it in the coffee. Her response was that she didn't know I just wanted a drip coffee and she was making an espresso. Sure enough, I Was charged for a whole different thing and she ended up just giving me a regular coffee with almond milk, all I wanted. I was wondering why I had paid $6 for a simple coffee.. not even Starbucks! To add on to the bad experience the place did not seem to have the AC on and it was terribly hot. Left after 10 mins to the Starbucks across the street. Will avoid this location at all cost.",

It is the perfect place to sit down and socialize with friends while enjoying live acoustic music. I also noticed 90% of the people there had laptops and were either working or studying. The great thing is they aren't your typical coffee joint as they have the live music, a small but appealing food menu, and a good selection of craft beer. I didn't try any food so I can't speak for that but my iced vanilla latte was great!",

Star 2 is for the food being worth the price! For the 10 bucks we paid for both our appetizers, the price wasn't bad at all.  Star 3 is for the amazing atmosphere. The atmosphere of this place is very unique and nice for a chill night with whoever, especially with the live music.  Star 4 is for the Wow factor. I was really wowed by  the atmosphere and feel of this place altogether.   I couldn't give a fifth star for the service because all we ordered were the two appetizers and it took a good 20 minutes or more to get them which wasn't the worst but considering the amount of people there it should have come out faster.",

In regards to the food, they do sell a great breakfast burrito....I'd recommend it. On some Sundays, they also have a local talent performing, and he is great (I'm blanking on his name at the moment...). Now, there is one very small detail that is a slight downside, the amount of parking spaces allocated for Sip is small, so carpool with a friend or you'll have to park around the corner.  Anyways, if you're looking for a cool place to get together with people, head to Sip - you won't be disappointed.",

This would overall be a four-star review, losing one for the mediocre food selection (if you're on a keto or low-carb diet, you're not gonna be able to eat here at all), buuuuuuut...  It loses a second star because all the seating in the whole place is kind of this weird hipster stuff, folding chairs or metal bandstand-looking things. Almost all of it is hard metal and uncomfortable. Not ideal for sitting and getting work done for a long afternoon.   It wasn't bad enough that I won't go back, but it's bad enough to keep it down to a 3-star. If they had seating that didn't make your butt go numb, I'd be able to more honestly recommend it.

Sip provides a lax environment for business meetings, study sessions, or just day to day meeting up for coffee or craft beer.   The patio is dog friendly; therefore my pup is another fan of Sip.   The craft beer selection is large; you won't find a beer you can't enjoy. The coffee is amazing if you order it tall or strong, don't mattahhh. Oddly, I enjoy paying at Sip as much as I enjoy lounging because their tip feature has appropriate saying's in order to justify the tip... if you really are only tipping 15% in today's era, the service was just, \"allllllllright\" If you aren't tipping or tipping the bare minimum, you don't appreciate Sip and what the unique spot has to offer! Because a 30% tip is worth it for the soft pretzel alone.    From the paintings, soap dishes, to every intrinsic detail is what makes Sip so posh and unique.

Some come to work, some come to hang out with family, while others come to socialize with friends. Might I add that they have adult beverages?! Something for everyone!

They have free wi-fi, limited parking, and really yummy food. I come for the food, no I'm lying I come for the sour beers! Why do so few places carry sours? I can always count on Sip having at least two on tap, and I feel no shame or guilt when I sample those two as I checkout and pay for whatever ridiculously calorie enriched meal I choose. By the time I take a Sip *see what I did there) I'm already asking for an order of that sour beer, and then for a tiny moment, it's minuscule really, I fear the calories and for my thighs, but again, minuscule, I enjoy being alive, \"Sip\"ping the sour beer and enjoying the yummy food. Come here, enjoy the music, the food, and the sours. Did I mention I love the sour beer? Yeah I did! Thumbs up for Sips!!",

The unfortunate thing was I paid for a Chemex coffee pourover, and it was basically light light brown colored water.  Decor: This location is perfectly settled on the main Old Towne strip, next to a brewery and sausage place. I love the inside decor, really gives you a hipster vibe, without the snotty people. It feels warm, comfortable, and welcoming. It really drew me in, especially since it was cold outside.  Beverages: So, they do have a great variety of beers on tap, and different coffee's/espressos. They also have tea for those who are more into tea. As mentioned above, I ordered the Chemex. For those who don't know, it's basically a pour over coffee. I waited the 10 minutes required for it to be done correctly. Sadly, my WHOLE party noticed that the \"coffee\" was basically water. I didn't take it back because I really didn't want to wait another 10 minutes while the rest of my party was already finishing up their drinks.   Food: They do have lighter fare foods, sandwiches, muffins, etc. I didn't eat anything seeing as the kitchen was closed after 7pm.  Overall: I really want to give this location another shot, but I really am upset that a coffee house really messed up a simple pourover.",

    "text": "Welp... here I am sitting at Sip Coffee and Beer House, mid-day, soaking up the free Wi-Fi and trying to change my life. I immediately ordered a Cartel Coffee cold brew. If you're ordering for the first time, get a large, you'll thank me later.   *Orders another coffee*  Scrolling through LinkedIn jobs I've recently decided I want a new job that I can enjoy. For all you job searchers out there I'm sure you understand that this is easier said than done. Why can't job postings just be real? Inside Sales Rep? I think what you really mean is sitting on the phone making 100 cold-calls a day. Pass.   *Orders another coffee*  OH! OH! Community Managers at Yelp? I love Phoenix! I'm a social connector! I have a fire in my belly! Wait, what? Forget that part... Pick me! Pick me!   ^ That was my exact reaction... until I scrolled to the bottom of the page, read a blog, and stalked Hilary H. for over an hour. I've now decided two things: 1. I will never be able to write 1000 reviews over night and 2. 2,448 friends? Is she for real? I think I have 19.   *Switches from coffee to beer*  *Calls mom to cry*  *Calls best friend to cry more*  After my emotional roller coaster ended, I put on some gangster rap. I prefer \"I'mma Shine\" by Youngbloodz, because if it's good enough to motivate Channing Tatum in Step Up, it's good enough for me.   I also ordered a breakfast sandwich. It comes on an everything-bagel, huge bonus, and of course I added bacon. I actually ordered it without any roasted tomato vinaigrette because that flavor combo seemed pretty intimidating to me. Lo and behold, the Sip kitchen knows me better than I know myself and added it anyways. Boy, am I glad they did.   On a real note: this place is great! If you're looking for some free Wi-Fi, a beer to cry over, or a carb-o-load to start your day you'll feel right at home here.",

While I'm not the biggest coffee fiend, I don't feel guilty getting some caffeine here.  The most important part of this whole operation is the staff.

This was two for the price of one. Very cool decor, comfortable, staff is ridiculously friendly, but not in an overbearing way at all.   They work with Cartel Coffee, which I had earlier in the day in downtown Phoenix and I can attest to the fact that it's really good stuff, even for the coffee snobs among us.  I chose from the fairly extensive beer menu and really combined the coffee and beer idea with Cartel's coffee stout (not sure that's the exact name, but you get the point). It was a perfect way to spend a late afternoon in Scottsdale... and it's nicely tucked away from the craziness of Old Town Scottsdale.   I can't wait to come back.",

I don't want to get in to all the details, but we stopped in for breakfast and the experience was kind of odd.  I ordered a burrito off the menu and it when it arrived it was missing two of the main ingredients as described on the menu. When I brought it back, the guy seemed surprised that I was displeased and acted almost as if I should just deal with it.  Since these were apparently premade by Brat Haus, I ordered a breakfast sandwich instead.  It was fine.... nothing special.  I think sips  is going to be a better Happy Hour spot, since it has a nice draft selection and pizza... you can't screw up pizza right? To Be continued....",

It's vintage, mismatched, old vs. new, junk yard vs. thrift shop and I couldn't be more smitten.     I love that they have a patio to sit on when it's nice in the mornings or at night and that it is actually a decently spacious area. When you walk in, you see tables set with faux flowers, the chalkboards full of coffee and beers to try (plus cheap beer flights!) and cute frames with their menu behind the counter.        I have tried both their kale salad and their frittata and enjoyed both thoroughly. I am all for the fact that they have put chickpeas, pomegranate seeds and bacon together in their salad--it's a great flavor combo!      Yesterday when I went in, I noticed a new section with pretzel bites and wraps while I hummed a long to N*Sync. Did I mention it's eclectic and has a fun, easygoing vibe? It does. It's wonderful.      To be noted: staff is friendly but not overbearing, they do \"Dress Up Friday\" happy hour that I think is ridiculously cute and have WiFi if you want to sit and sip away the afternoon.

Ordered the veggie tamale, burratta salad, and Italian panini. Veggie tamale was delish and great for a small bite. The salad was refreshing and had some crostini, and my fiance said the Italian panini brought him right back to fond memories of jersey with the fresh deli meat. I liked that the music was present but not overpowering. The overall atmosphere was very much a coffee house turned hang out at night. Only reason for the 4 stars is that it was a little on the pricey side, however we will be back! Oooh and they're patio is dog friendly!",

    "text": "The coffee situation: Sip use Cartel brand coffee and have on more than one occasion served it at luke-warm temperature. An easy fix, but still not the best sign that the simplest aspect of catering to the core customer base is neglected as an afterthought. I was informed the coffee is made once a day - in the morning. Perhaps Sip should just stick with their impressive beer selection on draft and skip the 'coffee thing' altogether? The look: The vintage decor is comfy/cool. I do love the outdoor seating and the ambient lighting is just right. The food: I had a sandwich. It was two slices of grocery-store bread with a few fixings. Not too impressed. The hummus was better. In general: This is the kind of coffee shop Scottsdale has been in desperate need for far too long. Other cities (San Francisco, Portland) have established destinations like this, so its a huge deal somebody finally trying to get it right. The service is pretty good, depending on who you get. The owner (guy with beard)  is a bid snide, truth be told. Not sure he comes from a customer service background, but there are books on the subject as well as some excellent YouTube videos! . Everyone else was engaging and friendly.",

Sip Coffee & Beer House is everything you want in an establishment go its kind: super laid-back, good music set to a manageable volume, great coffee, outstanding craft beer selection, even live music some nights!  The staff is consistently wonderful in my experience (kudos Alex and Sip crew!). It's also open later most nights than other coffee shops in the surrounding area, making it a great place to camp out for a while, even late at night.  The ambiance is right up my alley: very quirky and hipster-ish without being over-the-top. The place just kinda feels like home. It also has plenty of outside seating which is PERFECT as the cooler months approach. I'm actually seated happily at the covered patio as I type this.  This is one of those FEW places you frequent. I probably have half a dozen decent coffee shops within walking distance of where I live, but I still drive over here because it's just that good. Set just apart from the craziness of Old Town Scottsdale, it's a perfect location, too.  I can't say enough good about Sip. If you haven't been, GO! If you have been, you already know what I'm talking about, don't you? I've been coming here for over a year, and I'll keep on coming back. For now, I've gotta go: the live band is starting back up again.  ;)",

I'm not even sure how you mess up a breakfast burrito, but they do. I've had better $3 burritos. One of the best breakfast burritos I've had is from Giant Coffee downtown. It's too far to drive most of the time, so maybe Sip could call & get burrito help from Giant?  I love your coffee, please improve your food Sip. It's overpriced & not good.",

There was a live performance by singer/guitarist Sydney Sprague that afternoon and she was very good. I ordered a cappuccino and some tamales (red chili beef and a green chili chicken), followed a bit later by a macchiato; all of those were very good.  Parking was limited, though, and it took quite a while for me to get the things I had ordered. Other than these little details, the whole experience was pleasant. And there was free wifi, and I especially liked that outside the patio there were abundantly flowering shrubs which were attracting hummingbirds.",

    "text": "Sip is, quite literally, my favorite place outside of my home. Scratch that, sometimes I'd rather be at Sip! Here's why:  Kick ass staff-everyone that works here is super friendly. Alex has a magnificent beard. The owner is often on site, and he's super hipster and nice too! Not only do they know your name, they know your dog's name! Which brings us to reason #2.   Dog friendly-really, really dig friendly. Equal or more so than OHSO. They have water bowls on the patio, and the staff regularity comes out to play with your pups.   Ambiance-totally hipster in the best possible way. Mismatched thrift store furniture. I think the owner and his wife actually made the tables by hand. Lounge chairs are incredibly comfortable and placed around a coffee table, with end tables in between. This arrangement makes it the perfect place to park your tush for an afternoon of reading, or for a couple (or a couple of friends) to sit casually and talk. You often end up siting next to strangers, and it's never weird. I've struck up some amazing conversations with way!  Food-let's start with What the Buck Wednesday, where tamales are a buck and a buck off beer. Yes, you read that right. TAMALES! Better yet, they have vegetarian tamales and they are delicious. They have salads, breakfast sandwiches, bagels, pastries, and sandwiches (also with a veggie humus sand which, which you can order sans cheese for a yummy vegan option).   Coffee-Cartel coffee beans. Almond milk options. They know what they're doing over here.   Beer-they have a great selection of beer on tap, which they rotate regularly. I'm personally a porter/stout kind of girl, and only once have they not had one on tap. They even had pumpkin porter on tap in April! They also do mixed drinks and mimosa bar on Sundays.   Live music-pretty often. They have open mic nights as well. The music is usually acoustic and is one, at most, two person artists.   Yoga-during fall, winter, and early spring they do free yoga outside on Sundays at 9:00, partnered with Lulu Lemon. I'm a fan. It's beautiful and peaceful, then you can walk in and eat and drink.   See why it's my favorite place on earth?!",

I used to have a local, laid back joint with fresh, non mass produced coffee, fresh food, and a quirky vibe. The icing on the cake was the alcohol  served as well. I'd finish my work and reward  myself  after.   Alas, this place has all that. Finally!!  With both indoor and outdoor  seating, TONS OF SOCKETS to plug into, friendly staff,  great food and coffee...this is my new work spot.",

Plus great community events like outdoor yoga, and live music too - love this place!  They have multiple patios, as well as an indoor section with comfy seats plus metal tables - whatever you need!   My husband had a chai latte with almond milk and I had a black tea with mango - both yummy. Happy hour lasts until 7pm every day, so we ordered the tasty bruschetta- everything's made from scratch, in-house, and it shows! Later we split a huge pretzel for $5 - also great!",

Totally recommend it if someone wants to try some new places beside the regular coffee shop .",

We were overwhelmed with options so this is most definitely a place you need to return to again and again. The patio is lovely and it looks right out onto Scottsdale and Goldwater.  They will be hosting morning yoga here soon. Try the Kevlar coffee. It's fantastic. Oh - and the Bavarian soft pretzel - delicious. OH! crumb cake - amazing! Vanilla latte - best around.

It had wonderful flavor! I'd definitely get it again.   The decor inside is very unique, creative, and inviting. My favorite part was the old Jamison bottle that is now a soap pump!   There's plenty of seating, both inside and outside. I saw several business meetings  in-progress and several college-age students with laptops. Must be a popular place to do work!   If I am in Scottsdale again soon, I'll definitely stop back by for another cold brew.",

They use Cartel, but they do a good job foaming the milk to the point where it is very rich and creamy. I would come back for coffee. They also have many beers available (very nice), so I would like to come back to try that. It might not be the best place to hang out and get work done as it is very loud, but it would be a fun place to hang out at with friends. Check this place out!  PS Love the bathrooms - chalkboard walls FTW! PPS Pulling in to the lot of this place is a little difficult if you're coming from the south and don't know where it is.... it is right at the point where Scottsdale diverts into Scottsdale and Goldwater.... you can turn in from either street, but Goldwater would probably be easier (since it's on the right then).",

The cons:  If you're into wine, red or white. There are only 2 options. The red is a grenache blend. Not sure about the white. The pretzel was bland and somewhat hard. The cheese dip was okay. The prices are comparable to most other restaurants and I'm not sure the quality is comparable.    I was excited when this place opened because I thought, great something like Lux in CenPho, a coffee house that serves wine. Lux is def bigger. I guess it is nice sometimes to get away from the crowd and be somewhere not so packed. Def a good place to hang out or meet for a quick \"get to know you\" date. You know, where you don't want to invest in dinner but you want to have a glass of wine and your date doesn't drink.",

Everyone is super friendly and helpful. The overall atmosphere of the place is laid back. The perfect place for a coffee date or a study session.

I tried the pumpkin spice and it honestly didn't taste like anything to me. The espresso was too bitter and no sweetness of the pumpkin to balance it. Two packets of sugar later and it tasted bearable.  I wasn't impressed with the coffee and neither was my friend.   I would still come back to this place but maybe for having a cocktail, not coffee.",

The atmosphere is trendy but comfortable, and I love that their menu includes coffee, tea, wine, or beer. Plus the menu goes beyond standard coffee shop fare. The bruschetta hits the snack-spot every time!  I need to say, though, that this would be a 4.5 star review if that were an option. It is a bit pricey, but should be expected because of the area. Also, the sandwiches can be hit or miss... Had one that was alright and one that was too terrible to eat.   Let's go back to thinking about the bruschetta.",

We have been a few times in the morning and really enjoyed their classic lattes and bulletproof coffees. We also ordered their breakfast burrito and enjoyed them until we were told by the cashier that they were from a Mexican restaurant around the corner where we could have purchased them for half the price. Either way we enjoyed the morning atmosphere and looked forward to visiting for a beer flight in the evening. After a year of morning patronage, we finally made it this evening to sample their happy hour. First of all, they should have called it study hour, because, while it was packed, you could have heard a pin drop. Not exactly the atmosphere we were hoping for when sneaking out to a happy hour on the weekend! Worst of all, we took our one year old. We sat outside on the patio, and his occasional coos and aahs were such a juxtaposition to the volume in the room that we were rushing to finish our food and drinks and leave. Speaking of food and drinks, who serves tortilla chips with hummus? The hummus was tasty but nothing to brag about. The pretzel was hard and tough and the cheese it was accompanied by was gelatinous. We felt foolish ordering the pretzel because immediately next door was Brat Haus which serves the most delicious pretzels! Our Whiskey Mules also left something to be desired....and that was the whiskey. It tasted more like ginger ale. Overall, we were just looking for a good atmosphere and were left wanting. But we will be back to try out trivia night(hoping for an upbeat crowd), definitely for a classic latte in the morning, and are are anxious to try their new location.  Lesson Learned: Sunday Evening at Sip, make sure to bring your study books and laptop or you will be out of place and just...plain...bored...",

Everyone working here is unbelievably cool and kind and did I mention how great the coffee is? Not to mention a great selection of beers. They have the best atmosphere for either a cool coffee shop to get some work done, or beers with friends. Go, you won't regret it.",

Quality of food and beverages was great, staff was friendly and attentive. Had a great French Press, followed by a local lager while I work, because hey, it's vacation. Highly recommend. Now if they could open one back home....",
