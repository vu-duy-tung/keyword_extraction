My taco and enchilada combo was OK, but nothing great. I had asked for a side of sour cream, which I later found out on my bill cost me $2.00 for a tablespoon of sour cream! The server should have told me that, and I would have declined because that's insane - I deducted it from her tip, not to mention she seemed to want nothing to do with us.  The place is old and run down. The ceiling fan light that was over us was flickering and clearly needed to be changed. I think I almost had a seizure from all the flickering.   I haven't been back since, not saying that I wouldn't try it again, but was not impressed enough to want to come back.",

    "text": "This place is located near where a friend of mine worked and we started going at least once month for lunch.  We've continued that same pace for well over a decade.  Therefore, I've probably had more meals here than any other restaurant in the Phoenix area, besides it's close to where I live.  We like there food, service and atmosphere; although it is more of a dive than an upscale place, but I like it.  Lunch times can get very busy but the food arrives fast, the staff is friendly and the food consistently good.  This is just your regular Phoenix Mexican food, but good.  Whenever we go to another Mexican restaurant we always end up saying \"it's not as good as La Fonda Del Sol\" (with only one exception, but one in a completely different category - Los Reyes de la Torta).  As soon as you sit down they bring some of their wonderful homemade tortilla chips and two different homemade salsas; one hot (as in spicy) and one chunkier and not so hot.  Although I know I'm always going to \"suffer\" if I eat too much of their hot salsa, I simply can't resist and always ask for more chips and hot salsa; and then my intestines aren't happy with me because of all the \"hot.\"  I'd say that over 95% of our visits have been for lunch, so we always order from their lunch specials.  They do offer a wonderful, all you can eat; lunch buffet which I've tried and is very good, but since I don't eat large portions it is sort of lost on me.  Besides I simply love their lunch \"Cheese Relleno.\"  My friend almost always orders their lunch \"Taco Salad.\"  They have very good margaritas which we occasionally have.    Recently I've had several friends in from out-of-town that wanted Mexican food, so I've always spouted off several places we could go, but always include this \"little Mexican dive.\"  Every one of them has always selected this place claiming that the dives have the best food.  I tell them there are more upscale places we could go to but there response is \"we're buying and we don't want to spend much money on you (ha).\"  They've all loved it.  We are regulars in there.  Absolutely a 5-star \"dive\" wonderful Mexican restaurant.  Please, please, please - La Fonda Del Sol, never go out of business.",

First off, they gladly took our reservation and our nice long table was set and easy to go when we arrived. Second, as the group filtered in they were quick to take our drink orders (BTW margaritas are perfectly mixed), and third, the owner, Roman, managed to effortlessly take everyone's order with having to keep track of managing about 10 different checks!!! The food (which was amazing!!!) came out fast, hot, and perfect!! With all the noise and chaos amidst our own group, there were 2 orders miscommunicated, but, they fixed everything quickly and were all too glad to make everything perfect. We had so many different items ordered, but everyone had nothing but smiles, compliments and empty plates at the end (even with the huge portions)...it was just that hard to stop eating. I personally had the spinach enchiladas and they were divine! Fresh chips, home made salsas and sauces, warm and gracious staff all added to an unforgettable group dinner! We will definitely be back!!!",

I thought the refried beans were a little too salty. The service was slightly slow but that may be due to the fact that this place was busy. Our waitress, Claudia was very nice and funny. The busser refilled our chips without asking, that was nice.   Overall it's a great little place and we will be back!",

    "text": "After eating here several times - finally, a review.  This place is good!  What do I like about La Fonda Del Sol, you ask?  Well, first, it definitely has an ol' family restaurant, cantina-dive vibe.  Second - chips are brought to the table with two carafes of salsa and the chips are always HOT.  I mean HOT.  And Fresh - if not needing just a little salt.  Salsas are both delicious, and fresh.  (One of my favorite new \"F\" words.). Queso is delicious, and tip/note - comes with freshly made flour tortilla chips, not corn as is served HOT and complimentary with salsa.  Obviously a crowd pleaser because every table around me ordered the queso.  Third - Food comes out quickly, and also HOT.  Can't touch the plate hot.  And how do they make it stay hot for so long?  I have ordered a number of dishes but still come back to the chicken chimi with cream cheese.  I love cream cheese, and it is a different and tasty addition.  Seriously, I think there are three shredded/chunked chicken breasts wrapped in a deep fried pillow of delicious, then smothered with green sauce and melted cheese.  I have noticed they don't call it green chili on the menu, and it really isn't traditional green chili.  It is delicious though, and obviously made fresh from fire roasted green chilis.  Not too pepper hot - just the right \"kick.\"  Tasty retried beans; and rice.  Some may complain about the price, but for me each dish is at least two meals - so worth it from my perspective.    What to watch out for?  It gets crowded, and L-O-U-D.  Service is typically good, but I am not sure how they \"assign\" tables.  We typically have to wait to be first greeted, but then it stays pretty consistently attentive.  I have never been in the bathrooms, so can't speak to them, but the place is clean-ish.  Not dirty; just not confidently clean.  There were a couple of used napkins on the floor under my table, and I had to brush crumbs off my chair.  Not a big deal though.  The entry is not inviting.  In fact, it's a bit scuzzy.    Lastly, my only and completely random complaint, that they can really do nothing about (and it isn't deterring me from going back) - when you leave, you and your clothes are going to smell like you've been immersed in onion-grease-Mexican-corn-salsa-dip.  Not sure why or what it is because it isn't a prevalent smell or Odor inside - but trust me, you're going to smell it until the clothes and hair are washed.  All in all a good spot for tasty Mexican food!",

It's kinda a divey little spot but divey for your grandma. Prices are right in line with every other mexican spot. The normal fare, chimis, burritoes, fajitas, tacos. I had the cheese enchiladas and they were amazing! La Fonda offers something a little different in a mexican food place in that they have an all you can eat buffet, lots of different types of meat and beans. Pretty cool, no valid complaints other than the service was kinda slow but they were still friendly. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.",

The place is no frills on the outside, but has a quaint charm to it on the inside.  The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.  We got a cheese crisp to start, and it was definitely a good version.  Before we could even finish it our food started coming out of the kitchen.  My sister and I both ordered Combo #10 which included a shredded beef taco and a red or green cheese enchilada, we both chose red. Like a typical Mexican restaurant, our plates came out piping hot with the standard \"Don't touch, the plate is very hot\" warning from our waiter.  First things first, I took a forkful of beans and held it up, I could see the steam rising from them, I took the bite and was immediately in heaven! These are the beans that I have been searching for!!! They were so creamy and delicious, and had just enough cheddar cheese sprinkled on top....I could have seriously just had a plate of the beans and been happy!  I took a bite of the enchilada, I really liked the enchilada sauce, it had wonderful flavor and there was not too much cheese to where that was all you could taste, it was an excellent enchilada. I then tried the taco; the shell was crisp and filled with the shredded meat, lettuce, cheese and tomatoes. It was really good, the meat was not the best shredded beef I have ever had, but all the components together made it a taco that I would order again.  My dad loved the chile relleno con carne, he said it was a good version, and one of the best that he had had recently.  I decided I definitely needed to add La Fonda into my rotation, if only for the beans alone!",

We set down and you can tell this place is family owned. There we're young teenagers waiting on the table, and their english wasn't even that great. After I received my enchiladas/beans/rice plate, I looked down to see a HUGE pile of grease.  Beans are what you'd expect from a can you buy at the store. No real flavor, nothing special. The rice was on the plain side too. Pretty authentic, but lacked flavor. Good sauce on the enchilada, but boy that pool of grease made me quiver.  Hot hot chips, decent salsa.  What can I say?

The taco was one of those homestyle kind, where they start with a soft tortilla and fry it into shape until it's crispy.

    "text": "I ended up at this restaurant because of a recent <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Flivingsocial.com&s=2456932cd5ebcc60ad30944e723e56ffdb2706564dcfac90fbf2e821a2c1c821\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">livingsocial.com</a> deal.  It turned out to be a great buy and allowed me to find some \"authentic\" mexican food in Phoenix.  I was really pleased with this restaurant, and will definitely return.  For starters, the chips and salsa were excellent.  And you can have as much as you want, without being charged for an extra basket of chips.  I ordered a combo plate with tamale, taco, and cheese enchilada.  It also came with rice and beans.  Everything was great.  The enchilada was my favorite part of the dish, and I will definitely stick with this next time.  The tamale was very good for a restaurant tamale, and would hold up with any home made tamale out there.  The taco was not the best.  the meat was a little overcooked do to the deep frying of the shell, but it was still good.  Just not my personal favorite.  The enchilada was very good.  You could taste the home made tortillas and the red sauce was very tasty.  Definitely recommend.  The rice was very good and authentic.  The beans were ok, but not the best I have ever had.  All in all, this is the best mexican food I have had so far in Phoenix.  It only gets 4 stars though, because I have had much better in other cities.  But so far, I have not found better in Phoenix.    This will definitely be a frequently visited spot to satisfy my craving for authentic mexican food.",

Sad to see a family restaurant go downhill, but that happens after time and as the owners get older.",

It's nothing fancy and I wouldn't recommend this place for a date night or a night to impress anyone by ambiance, but I have to admit that the food was fantastic. And if there's one thing my family knows about - it's Mexican Food.   I had a simple Bean & Cheese Burrito enchilada style and it was delicious. It was moist and filled with tons of beans and cheese and the enchilada sauce was great. My mother-in-law go the salad with fresh grilled pineapple, mango and chicken and it was delicious as well. The chips and salsa were pretty good (I still prefer Aunt Chiladas) but the service was quick, the vibe was mellow and the food was tasty.   I don't live in the area and won't be driving out of my way to come back, but I'd recommend it if you're in the area and looking for some good Mexican.  Note: the combination entrees seemed a little pricey to me. We each got al-a-cart items which came with sour cream, lettuce & tomato and were plenty big.",

The salsa & chips were disappointing, all I could taste on the mild salsa was thei onion but my husband said the hot salsa was better. We had a quesadilla which was okay. My son had a bean burrito with rice, he loved the burrito but generally isn't a fan of Spanish rice. My husband has the chile rellano and was disappointed. I had the Machaca Chimi & beans. Both my husband & my plate were beyond hot! The refried beans were actually bubbling! I am not exaggerating when I tell you we had to wait about 20 minutes to eat our food because it was so hot! In all fairness the chimi & beans were actually good but overall not a pleasant experience.The service was okay but not great. Sad to say we were sorely disappointed!",

The place was busy but we were not ignored.  We got a sampler ala cart plate because we were ready to try some authentic Mexican food rather than Northwest Mexican food.  We had a tamale and chili relleno.  Both were good.  Good flavor and cheesey but not too much.  Of course the tamale doesn't compare to Bobby Flay's tamale at his restaurant but this was a good one.   I think next time we will have to get a margharita and try some other items.",

Really good Mexican food-not the touristy crap or the Scottsdaled up version.  I tried the green chile and loved it.   Decor is nothing to write home about, but not a complete dive either.  Service was excellent.  I actually didn't find it all that cheap considering it's basic Mexican food, but I guess it's cheap for Scottsdale.  Dinners run about $12 on average.  Lunch about $7.  They also have breakfast.  On the bad side, they apparently have a lunch buffet.  God only knows how big my ass will get knowing that tidbit of information.  Five dollar a gallon gas may actually be a good thing.",

In fact, I'm sure the experience you'll have here is just about the opposite.  It's in a location that the 70s Historical Preservation Society must be fighting to keep alive. I'd like to say it has character, but this old poorly designed strip should probably be nuked from space. However, you can't really complain too much when it's one of the few remaining old-school Mexican joints in town.   It's clean, everyone is nice, and the atmosphere inside is cozy. As my mother said... if you eat here, you can pretty much plan on going home smelling like Mexican food. Whether that's a good or bad thing can be up to you.   The food is just slightly above average for this type of place. Chips were okay. I put the salsa as below average. It was flavorless, but hot. The cheese crisp was good... not too oily. The guac was good. My entree was decent. It's the type of place that serves you standard old-school dishes - generally an ugly 70s plate full of grease with a sea of beans and slop and cheese and whatnot on the side. Same story as many other places. Too much to eat, and basically none of it is healthy, and basically all of it will either constipate you or clean you out.  The margaritas were pretty good. I would eat and drink here again I suppose if someone else was paying. This is your mom and dad's joint. Wish it was better.",

This family owned and operated business prides itself on knowing its clientle and every time my husband and I visit, they remember our usual drink order -- and have remembered almost from the first visit -- and have it ready for us the moment we sit down.  My favorite dish is the tamales, which are something I learned to love in my home state of Texas, and I love, love, love La Fonda Del Sol's version of home style tamales.    The food is reasonably priced, generous portioned; the wait staff is friendly, and service is prompt.   I judge a Mexican place by the quality of its salsa, and this place wins big on the salsa.  One is mild, but really flavorful, and the other has a great level of heat.  The chips are great.  In all the ways a Mexican restaurant should be good, this one is great.",

The much anticipated carnitas tamale was smothered in a run of the mill red enchilada sauce that totally masked any flavor it may have had.   I found it also be a little pricey for what it is. Not outrageous by any means, but barely one step up from Taco Bell, shouldn't cost three steps up.  On the plus side, the guacamole was excellent. garnishes of cheese and black olive slices were a very nice touch, and a perfect contrast against the tangy guac. The chips were great, very thin, crispy, and served scorching hot. I also like the chunky fresh tasting salsa. (There is a second mini carafe of a hotter version which you can blend to your desired level of heat). Overall though, our entrees reminded me more of the frozen mexican \"tv dinners\" that my Mom would heat up for us in the oven than anything I'd expect to be served in a restaurant. Satisfying, but lowest common denominator generic!",

We also ordered the sopapillas and churros for dessert and they were enjoyed as well! The churros were a bigger hit though!  Portions are really big and prices are great.

They offer a mild salsa as well. Only criticism is the hard taco shells seemed a little tough and were served in the enchilada sauce on the same plate so we're soft on the bottom. Definitely a place to keep on our list of favorites!",

Not getting my order right is kind of expected as we see the wait staff rush around the place like crazy. If they could slow it down a bit, they'd be able to get things  right the first time so that everyone in the same party can eat at the same time. I ordered a chicken and spinach enchilada and only got spinach. Boo. Then they took it back and brought it out super fast with chicken on the side. Plus, the cheese dip came late and with the rest of the meal. I dont care to go back for a long time.",

    "text": "While in Scottsdale for Thanksgiving, the family opted to go out for Mexican Food one night. Not only was I excited to sample some of Arizona's notorious Mexican cuisine, but who am I to turn down a free meal?  Star 1 - How was the service and atmosphere?  While not overly packed on the Wednesday evening that my party of six visited, service seemed a bit on the rushed side. While our particular server (who appeared to possibly the the owner) was very nice, the she seemed to be ushering us along quite quickly. While not enough to warrant a star deduction, this should probably be noted. Star Granted.  Star 2 - How were the portions relative to the cost?  As far as the selection goes, La Fonda is pretty much on par with any of the basic Mexican joints that I've encountered in Colorado or Los Angeles. However, while the menu had a decent selection, mostly combinations of Tacos, Enchiladas, Burritos and Platters, prices were very much on the high side. I opted to go for the Machaca Dinner, and for $13.50 pre-tax, this is what I received:  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Vj-NbtXv5UrYBDUvqUuYqA&userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  Hm. Yes, that's a decent amount of meat, but I'd certainly say no more than $6 or $7 worth. That being the case, roughly $6 was spent on basic Spanish rice and beans? Yikes. Even for gourmet Mexican, that's too much. No Star Granted.  Stars 3/4 - How was the food?  While I wasn't disappointed with my meal, it was by no means the best Mexican I've ever had. The Machaca was very dry (overly crunchy at some points, and the rice and beans were nothing special. Especially paying $13.50? Quality needs to be bumped up a bit. Single Star Granted.  Star 5 - Would you eat it every day if you could?  With the truly vast number of Mexican options in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area, I can't say there's any way I could make La Fonda Del Sol a daily stop due to high prices and mediocre food and service. No Star Granted.",

I really hate to sound this harsh, but it really was not good and had no value for money. If this is the level they can provide for the price they should just discontinue it.

The ambiance is hole in the wall-esque. The food and service were obviously not too bad because I would have remembered that but also not so awe-inspiring that I have vivid recall about what we ate.   The concierge did not lead us totally astray but it is safe to say that the restaurant is eminently forgettable.",

Sooooo, we decided to give it a shot on a random Sunday around 5ish and hopefully find our go to Mexican joint in the neighborhood.   The chips are fresh and crisp and PERFECT, the salsa was on point as well. I appreciate they brought out a spicy and mild. I found the perfect combo to be 1 part spicy to 3 parts mild .  The queso dip isn't something we will order again. It tasted like straight velveeta but it came with what I think we're fried flour tortillas and those were the best part of the app.  My husband and I both ordered the la Fonda special chimichanga (chicken, cream cheese, jalapeno cheese) don't get me wrong, it was ok, just not something I'll order again. However, the defried beans ... Yes please! Wow wow wow.  All in all I'm not impressed but since it's less than 5 minutes away i know I'll give it another try.",

I ordered the beef taco and cheese enchilada.  Boy have I tasted better.  The beef was greasy and tasted kind of foul.  The cheese enchilada was drowning in cheese that I couldn't find the enchilada.  Oh, the refried beans???  Canned.  Yuck.  Someone asked for another tortilla and they were charged $3.00.  They were not told by the waitress that there would be an extra charge.  And when the person asked about the charge the assistant manager came over and actually started arguing with the person.  Such poor customer service for a darn tortilla.  Expensive for the low quality of food.  I definitely will not be going back.",

It's significantly less Tex Mex than most places in AZ and is more like sit down places in southern CA   The plates don't have excessive cheese so the meal is much less heavy and greasy. They don't kill it with too much sauce and the overall plate is not salty. The person who assisted me seemed to be the owner and she was so gracious and welcoming. The bar looked really comfortable and the wasn't too loud. It looks like a great place to watch a Suns game...If watching the Suns could ever be considered great. Seating is booth style and kind of dark.,,very cool vibe. The staff seemed like they were happy to be there and happy to have me there. If I lived in AZ I would be a frequent customer.

    "text": "Someone asked me about a review of another Mexican restaurant which warranted a one-star from me.  Seems like several other people love the place.  Glad it satisfies them, and even more glad I have La Fonda to eat at.  La Fonda del Sol -- the restaurant of the sun, I believe -- has been around forever.  I never went there -- it's in a very old shopping center at SE Shea and Scottsdale, and it's a well-worn place.  For whatever reason, a friend suggested we meet up there about a year ago.   What a gem!  From 11 to 2 (maybe 3) they have a buffet in addition to their regular menu.  Is there anything on the buffet that is not delicious!  (Well, the menudo. I hate menudo.  Honestly never tried La Fonda's menudo, but as long as they call it menudo, I'll hate it.  If you like menudo, it's probably very good.)  Starting with chicken in red sauce, then green chile enchiladas, cheese enchiladas. tilapia, chicken fajitas, shredded beef, etc.  Excellent pico de gallo.  An array of beans, jalapenos, and relishes.  Fruits and pudding for dessert.  I'm good for three plates and dessert.  Oh, and the chips and salsa at the table are great, too.  My friend is of Mexican descent -- a great grandfather came to the States running from Poncho Villa -- says the food is just like his mother used to make.  Dunno about that.  All I know is it's great.",

The margaritas are not special (taste like a mix or a pre-bottled version).  So why do I like it?  Because it's one of those little family run places with a great one-of-a-kind atmosphere.  Because the chips come warm and with two kinds of salsa.  Because the staff cares and makes you feel at home.   I go for the atmosphere and the perfectly adequate food.  Incidentally - the flautas were overcooked - crunchy, but the fajitas were quite good.",

My chicken taco was dry and bland. The red enchilada sauce had no flavor at all. The salsa was super yummy and fresh, though.   I won't ever go back - primarily because their ceiling fans cause the lights to flicker, which can trigger migraines, and which I'm prone to. If you get migraines, steer clear!",

Makes for a great time with friends. I'm a classic margarita kind of gal so I didn't venture too far out of my comfort zone, but they definitely gave me a good buzz.  The kicker here is the service.

I liked to mix them here to get the perfect amount of heat I like it was yummy the chips could have been a tad better some were a little too toasted. I had a chile relleno lunch their beans and rice were great no complaints the egg on the relleno was a little too peppery for me but I dont like pepper too much yet I still cleaned my plate. My mom had an enchilada she ate it up quick and the kid's plate was so cute w a mini taco my daughter liked that she could put the not hot salsa in the taco and eat it! =) Quick and very pleasant service. Could use a little dusting pics coming soon.",

Being the last customers for the night I totally expected the staff to be butthurt but they weren't.  Everyone we encountered smiled and was friendly.  Several other tables emptied and it was close to closing time, the mop never came out, they didn't start flipping the chairs upside down on the tables. I had the La Fonda Chimi which was wonderful.  He had the chicken fajitas and they came with the usual on a separate plate. I loved the guacamole and the salsa. The chips were hot and fresh. I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "When they bring the chips and salsa, ask for a straw.  Stick it in the mild salsa container and suck until the container is empty.  This will be the culinary height of the meal.  I ordered the Armando Combination so that I could try different things.  Don't do that.  I heard a waitress suggest the Carne Burrito.  Too late for my order.  The food, simply said, was bland.  The mild salsa was a medley of fresh ingredients in just the right mix.  Awesome.   The interior was classic small Mexican restaurant.  The service was fine.  Honestly, another visit is necessary to make a final decision.  But until then, I have to agree with Kansas G.  So, if you came for the food review, you can move on.  If you are interested in a little social commentary, please read on.  [Steps up on soapbox]  1) I really wish someone had warned me that this was \"loud talker night\" at La Fonda.  I'd have gone tomorrow.  2) Memo to the F-bomb boys across the restaurant: This isn't a saloon or some spit on the floor, get piss drunk night out at the pool hall.  So could you please keep the F-bomb laced conversation for the ride home?  I realize you were here on \"loud talker night\" but that only intensified the offensiveness.  Don't get me wrong, I love a great profanity-laced conversation as much as the next guy, just not at dinner.  3) While I'm sure that you believe that the $3.95/month you're paying for that shitty and annoying ringtone is a great investment, Harley-wearin'-F-bomb dude, I don't want to hear it at dinner.  Put the F-er on F-ing vibrate, please.  Does that help?  4) And then, once you answer the shitty ringtone call, please realize that the dude on the other end of the line does not hear you any better if you YELLLLL.  Of course I do, complete with the F-bombs.  [Stands down from soapbox]  What the hell is happening to our manners?  Thanks for listening.",

    "text": "If La Fonda Del Sol existed in New York City, there would be a line around the block waiting to get seats. The irony, of course, is that Arizonans consider this to be perfectly passable Mexican food, but a far cry from palate-pleasing perfection. I suppose I find myself bitter knowing that such deliciousness could be viewed with such a blase indifference by Phoenix's elite critics; in New York, we still seek out the one True answer to the Mexican food problem, yet in Phoenix, the answer is so abundant it produces disenchantment.  Well, friends, we'd gladly take your La Fonda Del Sol. You get to keep the rest of those Mexican restaurants you love, so it's only a minor loss. In exchange, you may have a Rosa Mexicana and a Dos Caminos. Nay, don't thank me.  So, La Fonda.... Truly spicy, homemade salsa; perfectly crisp chile rellenos bathed in cheese, crusty chimichangas battered in love and ambrosia, husk-wrapped tamales that taste homemade; huge portions, incredibly low prices. This is what it's all about.  Yeah, the tacky pastel Mexican decorations are unnerving and the service is slow and often panicked, but these are minor gripes.  When it's all said and done, these idiots forklift themselves into the waiting lines of NYPD Pizza (HA! HAHAHA!) and Oregano's (BAHH! HAHA!) while overlooking the real gem that sits in between them. Well, if you're a New Yorker like me, you're not gonna try either of those wrecks anyhow; go get some Mexican.",

Young guy with brown hair and glasses absolutely amazing. For how slammed that poor guy was customer service his attitude and his attention to detail was outstanding. The queso is amazing I would just say to serve it though with regular chips not a fan of the flour crisps. Their chips and salsa are probably the best in the valley except for maybe los dos molinos but that is very far from where we live. son got the Carne asada wow the meet is so tender and great flavor. Other son bean burrito  fine husband Carnitas very good. My only negative feedback is I ordered the chili relleno and it was definitely not the best I've had. The batter used to coat it is very odd it's like a crusty omelette s/b fluffy and soft and the chile itself inside was too crispy it should be cooked thoroughly & easy to cut w/ a fork. However the ranchero sauce is very good maybe they can work on the other 2 issues. But not everything can be perfect so I'm OK with it. Next time I think I'll order the beef hard taco that's my other go to. I love that they serve Coke products I mean who serves Pepsi products anymore? I will continue to go here with my family and each time I'll try something different until I figure out what my favorites are",

If you like great service, authentic Mexican food, free chips and salsa that are homemade (plenty of cilantro and peppers), then it's tough to beat La Fonda del Sol.  It's not fancy, but the service was fantastic and food dynamite.    The service was fantastic, they were busy, but both our waiter and person serving water was around twice as much as you'd find in most Mexican restaurants that charge twice as much.  A previous poster said the salsa was good.  I agree.  It comes out with hot and mild, or mix it for a good combination of both.  The dishes were well proportioned and authentic - I didn't get the usual velveeta cheese taste like you will at chain Mexican restaurants.  I ordered the #1 combo which came out with great beans and rice.  Throw in some of that hot salsa on there and you can't miss!  The bonus for the night was listening to the staff cheer during the Mexico/US soccer game.  I take it Mexico won as there was a lot of cheering.  Order a margarita or tecate and enjoy yourself here!",

It was 10:55 & was told we could not get  breakfast the cook had already broken down the kitchen but we could order it off the dinner menu, you get one more egg and and can chili sauce instead I'd the Rancho sauce. it only costs $7.00 more each! Seriously I asked, it's not 11 yet and you can't make us the breakfast huevos. Your sign says breakfast until 11. We sucked it up and ordered since we drive all the way there and to top it off it still came out with the ranchero sauce.  Wanted to speak with owner as I have been going there for the past 12 years but she was not in. Unfortunately it will probably be another a while before I go back or ever recommend it as the best Mexican food in Scottsdale again.  Si much for customer service. This would have never happened had there been a manager on.",

I'm also an avid taco lover. I'm 7 months pregnant so I would like them every day. The red chili I had at La Fondas today almost brought a tear to my eye. The beef in the chili and the taco was tender and flavorful. Rice and beans yummy. Salsa was ah mazing. My hubby had the fundido and barely spoke as he was so engrossed in the deliciousness. Not close to our Anthem home but I'll go back any opportunity I get.",

I grew up in Calif enjoying the Calif /Mex food from local friends and this  has that flavor. The FISH TACOS here are AMAZING! Fresh and NONE of that stupid sauce or added fat...these are GRILLED..they are light & tasty. The HOT chips are fantastic, mix the salsas they bring to the table & ask for a small bowl to enjoy. Really a great place...over 25 years in the same location...that tells you something especially in the Restaurant industry. When we are in Scottsdale we eat Mexican here. Good food, good value and good waitstaff. We never thought it would be hard to find good mexican food in Scottsdale, but it is...this is a great place!",

As people were arriving he would get drink orders but after 12 of us were there I did have to ask for chips and salsa since we were only given one bowl.  The food was ok. I ordered cheese enchiladas with green sauce, beans and rice. I ordered an egg on top (my own preference for New Mexican style). The food was hot and while it tasted good, I wished it had had more sauce because you could barely see it.  I felt bad for the server because he had no system to remember who got what dish and he struggled to deliver it correctly.  Overall it was ok. If I go back it will only be because the group chooses to.",

    "text": "As counter intuitive as it may seem for someone living in Phoenix, I've actually struggled to find a decent Mexican restaurant as of late. That said, after last night's experience, I think my search may finally be over.   What originally drew me to La Fonda Del Sol, surprisingly, was the architecture. I saw the photos of the exterior and interior arched arches, the exposed brick walls, the wrought iron, the stepped entrance way and the small enclosed patio and I thought that, if nothing else, it certainly looked legit. Appearance wise, this was spot on for what I expect from an authentic Mexican restaurant, and it absolutely reminded me of the places I used to eat at back in the 80s and 90s.   Once we stepped inside, there was yet more retro ambiance to be had. The vinyl booths, arched walkways and murals, even the laminated, tri-fold menus, all screamed 1990s Mexican restaurant. Shortly after we got seated, we were brought a couple of small carafes with house made salsas, and a bowl of fresh, warm chips. The chips were good, and my wife and I liked both of the salsas. Just enough heat in the hot one, and lots of flavor in the milder one. Surprisingly, this is another thing that most places get wrong, so I was happy to see that it was well executed here.   For entrees, we decided on the Flamingo dinner and a large tropical salad. The wait was very reasonable and when the food arrived, it did not disappoint. The chicken in the tropical salad was extremely flavorful and I ended up pinching a few pieces from my wife's plate. As to the Flamingo dinner, it was everything I had hoped it would be: good sized, properly fried chimichanga, guacamole and sour cream on top and plenty of beans and rice, all served piping hot. The chicken in the chimichanga was tender and moist, well seasoned and there was plenty of it to be had. I was sold after the first bite, and promptly devoured the entire thing. This was the chimichanga I had been searching for and not finding anywhere else!   As far as service, I cannot complain about any aspect of it. From the moment we walked in the door, we were greeted promptly and immediately seated. This was followed very shortly by delivery of our chips and salsa and then our fantastic server, Roman, took care of us from that point on. He got our order in quickly, made to sure everything came out right, and always kept our drinks refilled. Absolutely fantastic service.  After last night's experience, I can say without any doubt that my wife and I will be returning as regulars. My only regret is that I did not find this place sooner. If you're looking for authenticity when it comes to a Mexican restaurant experience, look no further, this is the one. Highly recommended!",

    "text": "Had a quick and delicious lunch here today and 3:00 PM was a perfect time to eat here because the restaurant was quite and empty. From the outside it looks just like it does on the inside, nothing fancy, just an older looking building. When walking in it's dimly lit and again there's nothing fancy to the decor except the celebrity lined wall as you enter the restaurant. Dwayne Wade and Gabrielle Union photos are on the wall. Once you get through the entrance we discovered what was waiting inside was worth the quick drive from Fountain Hills.  After putting in our order of 2 beef and cheese enchilada combo plates, our server brought us a hot basket of chips and two choices of salsa, and in small glass containers, one was pico de Gallo style and the other one deemed hot was in puree form. Both were equally delicious and the one the waiter told us was hot, was hot and had a nice spicy kick to it and yes, the more dips of the chips into the salsa the hotter my tongue got.  Within 15 minutes our food order came up and the waiter said \"be careful the plate is super hot.\" Of course what do we do when a waiter says that? We touched the plates and it was truly hot, hot, hot. Lol. I looked at the plate and saw the beef taco was loaded with beef, sliced nicely, cheese and shredded lettuce and the cheese enchilada was gooey with cheese but still firm looking. And if that wasn't enough their was a healthy portion of Spanish rice and refried beans. It had to be at least 2 nice scoops of rice on this combo plate for $9.95. BTW, lunch special is daily, so make sure you ask for it as the lunch menu has a decent variety and nicely priced, even on a Sunday.  The one thing I knew for sure was that the food was gonna be amazing, it looked amazing, was served piping hot (I have a thing about getting served hot food) and once I had a little bite of everything I found that every mouthful was mouthwatering yummy and not so salty. Everything here was just right. If you want a homey, kick back and chill place where you can eat a good, reasonably priced meal try La Fonda, it's a hidden jewel in Scottsdale.",

Yes, my parent's neighbor painted the murals here in the early 90s.  Finally, I acknowledge that every Arizonan has their Mexican food spot. THIS ONE IS MINE.   I love La Fonda like a brother or old friend, that never lets you down. Their chips fill you up before dinner because you eat three bowls of them and basically drink the salsa. Everything on the menu is delicious. Yes, be careful, that plate just came out of the oven and will burn the daylights out of you.   There are always leftovers. The margaritas are on point. The red sauce is Sonoran style. The green is amazing but nobody ever orders it because they're stupid. I love La Fonda.   La Fonda has been there for me, in thick and thin. When I am happy, La Fonda. Sad? La Fonda. Looking for a good margarita? La Fonda. Quiet night out? La Fonda. Need a babysitter? Nana in La Fonda loves babies. She will take our girl to the fish tank and laugh with her. You see, La Fonda is the answer to everything.   Also, native Scottsdalians (or whatever we are called) gravitate here. Want to run into a friend you've known for 30 years? You guessed it! La Fonda!  Come here. It is the best place. It is a Mecca. And one of the last surviving original businesses in this area, even Saba's Western Store just died. Keep La Fonda alive. Our lives depend on it.   I love La Fonda. The End.",

We are certain the management did not know how noisy the group would be. We asked our server if there was another table in a semi private room in front of us. We were told it was for larger parties than 2.  When I returned home I called the manager who said after more tables complained she spoke to the obnoxious party. Too late for us.

Staff was very friendly, even at the end of the night.  The small nacho plate was actually big enough that two people could've shared it and had enough food.  The corn tamale was amazing!!! I don't know if I've had one that was that delicious and perfect texture- not dried out.  The burrito, despite just being a bean burrito, was huge! But it had a nice creamy taste to the beans (which are vegetarian btw).  Very excited to have found this place! Prices were very reasonable and food was exceptional!!!",

The waiter completely messed up the order and brought all incorrect food and proceeded to hand us a bill for items that we never received.   The manager should have comped our $62 check and instead, had me go through every item that we ordered and received. Not my job...   We had family in from out of town who wanted great Mexican food. We could have gone anywhere and we chose this place unfortunately.   As we were waiting, a cockroach ran across the floor. Disgusting. Never ever EVER will I return to this place.",

Good chips, salsa and hot sauce. They have Fanta!  Service is spotty. 3 to 5 stars.  Dining room is every bit the dive. But it's clean. 5 stars. See \"restrooms\" below.   Consistent with being a dive, the menu has mis-prints. \"Cream cheese.\" On Mexican food? Probably mean sour cream, I think. Either that or the cream cheese is super sour and soupy!  Restrooms are out of the 1970s. 0 stars. Just avoid them. Probably costs too much to remodel which would force ADA compliance and cut into their dining area.  I imagine this place does just fine without worrying about fixing anything.   Definitely coming back.",

We have never ordered anything that we didn't enjoy.   The only thing I noted yesterday was the cheese crisp was 'runny' and not spread or cut evenly...I think it came out too early.  Also they used to bring the hot salsa out in a full container and now only do half; that said, they gladly bring more.  (Chips and salsa are excellent.)  Most of the servers have been there 'forever' and the owners is always around and active.   When we arrived yesterday they weren't busy, so service started out good.   However, in the next half an hour they filled to capacity and they weren't staffed for it, so it was very difficult to get prompt or attentive service from that point forward.  The atmosphere is where they suffer a bit.  The restaurant hasn't been updated in years and their is quite a bit of wear and tear.   But the oddest part, that I noticed today, and then when I read other reviews, is that something about the ventilation system means your clothes end up smelling really strongly of the kitchen.   I don't know what they can do about that without closing down for a significant remodel and none of us locals want that.",

The beans and rice had no flavor, and the mild salsa had too much onion.

Yes, the chips are free and warm, but they are very thin and if you are dipping, most will break in half. Fonda uses that dumb salsa in a jar style which still makes no sense (Give us a bowl of salsa). My main course was a watery, messy disaster and the owner who I will call \"mama\" could barely defend her chile relleno after I called her out on the nasty food. The coating on the tiny pepper fell off and somehow it looked like my plate got flooded with pepper juice or an unknown liquid, possibly from the watery beans (see pics). Mama did shoot back a comment, but never full stood at our table and chatted after she got a negative response from me over the standard \"How is everything\" question. Keep serving up that slop mama and believing your Mexican food is good, but the smart diners will go elsewhere for a better experience. If I wanted soup, I would have ordered it mama!",

The service is friendly and punctual and you cannot go wrong regardless of the meal. If you're snobsdale type person, the ambiance may not be your speed - for all others embrace and enjoy.  In the end, the line out the door waiting for a table tells the story.  Highly recommend the Especial Fundido Burro. Normally this comes with chicken, but if you ask nicely they will fill it with ground beef.  It is a True cornucopia of delight..  Best nights with no waiting - Tuesday - Thursday.  Friday and Saturday always seem busy at dinner time.",

I have lived in Phoenix for about 8 years now, 5 years in Scottsdale and I'm sad it took me this long to find this place! La Fonda Del Sol hit the spot!! Traditional Mexican food, some may call it \"old school\" with all the flavor I loved from the Mexican restaurants back in CA!   Chips come out hot- served with 2 types of salsa which were both delicious. I ordered the shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada combination. The beef taco was just delicious. They fry up the taco shell which makes it even more authentic. Red sauce on enchilada was very flavorful. Rice and beans were very good. Beans were thicker and very good! My dad got the shredded beef taco and cheese Chile relleno and he enjoyed both very much. Green sauce with the Chile relleno was really yummy!   Margaritas and staff were also great! Would highly recommend if you're looking for traditional Mexican food in a traditional Mexican restaurant setting. Will definitely be back!",

It doesn't look like much from outside, but right away we were greeted and seated. The location is a bit small, but looks so much larger once inside. The menu was pretty great and I knew almost instantly what I was having. Chips and salsa were brought out and my only complaint was I hate that they put the salsa in little jars . I'm not a fan of having to dump it on to a plate and try to pick it up on your chips. But that's my opinion and didn't take away any from the great food and service. The chips came out still warm and tasty. I decided to try something new and ordered the Del Sol Combination which came with rice and beans, Sour Cream Enchilada, Chicken Flauta ,And Cheese Chili Relleno. I ate every single bite! My husband had fajitas and loved them. He said the refried beans were really good. The guacamole on my flauta was so good. I wish I had more. Everything was priced very well for the large portions. Can't wait to visit again.",

First, the chips come out super hot with two choices of salsa. I like mild salsa and ooooo weeee it was probably the best salsa I've had as well. It has a ton of flavor and tastes incredibly fresh.   We ordered the beef tacos al la carte in photo, the lunch special G (no pic sorry!) beef taco and cheese enchilada- it was impeccable!, and I had the lunch special E I believe. It was the burro with red or green sauce and comes with rice and beans. I had mine with shredded chicken and I wanted to try both the red and green sauce. So I got it half and half :D. The red sauce had a stronger flavor which was really good. The green was good too, next time I'll get it all red. The chicken was so moist and tender and had really good flavor! The tortilla was so soft and enjoyable. This place is honestly so good!   Tried a bite of my bros beef tacos and they were the best as well! Crispy crispy shells with very tender shredded beef. Truly authentic and delicious.",

That is why I decided to drive up to this part of Scottsdale to try La Fonda Del Sol.  Walking in (from the rear entrance) you see a setup for a buffet and tons of photos of famous people on the walls, didn't know what to make of all this. We were greeted and seated and immediately upon sitting down we met with a ton of noise. I don't know if it's the narrowness of the restaurant or the walls but this place gets super loud - to the point of annoyance.  My buddy and I ordered some food, it was okay - it wasn't awful but wasn't food that I'd have to make the trek up to this part of Scottsdale to eat again. Our server was attentive and nice, but overall given how loud this place gets and the food being just okay I do not foresee returning here again.  If I was to give it a rating based on distance I would say this: if are further than 3 miles from this place I wouldn't make the drive to check it out.  The search for mindblowing Mexican food in this part of Phoenix Metro continues! (If any of you  fellow Yelpers reading this have a recommendation for me please shoot me a message).",

    "text": "La Fonda Del Sol is the perfect Mexican restaurant. It has everything I have ever looked for in a Mexican restaurant. Absolutely amazing food and great service where the waiter is super helpful.  We started with the complimentary chips and salsa. The chips actually came out super warm and in a huge basket. They were nice and thick and crispy. They bring you two kinds of salsa, one hot and one medium. Both were great.  Cadillac Margarita ($11.95 large) - Once we heard they had a margarita made with Patron we decided we had to try it. We ordered one to share and the waiter mentioned we could get a large for only $2 more. Why not! This margarita was really nice and strong, not for those who like super sweet margaritas. 4/5  Supreme Nachos with Chicken ($8.95) - I was going to get the large nachos and the waiter suggested I go for the small, since the large apparently feeds 2-3 people. All I can say is THANK GOD he did because the small size was massive and I couldn't even finish that! These nachos were the nachos I dream about getting every time I order nachos when I eat out and am usually disappointed. They were absolutely covered in cheese and there was no chip without something on it. The beans were mixed in to the cheese to create an amazing gooey spread. It also came with chicken and scoops of guacamole and sour cream. Honestly, these were in the top 3 best nachos I've ever had. And if you know me, you know how much I love nachos. I would highly recommend. 5/5  Fajita Burrito Dinner ($15.95) - The husband ordered a chicken fajita burrito and the waiter mentioned that if he wanted rice and beans on the side, he could get the Shrimp Fajita Burrito Dinner and get chicken instead of shrimp. Does this waiter read minds?? That was exactly what my husband had wanted and he was so happy to get that. As soon as he bit into this burrito his eyes lit up and he said \"oh my god this is the best burrito I've ever had\". I was like yea yea let me eat my amazing nachos. But finally I got curious at his enthusiasm and asked for a bite of chicken. HOLY CRAP. This was the most flavorful, juiciest, grilled chicken I have ever had in my life. It was the most delicious thing I've ever tasted. After that bite I was so jealous and wanted that dish for myself! 5/5  I am so sad we don't live in Arizona because I would literally eat here once a week. And if we ever come back, I am running to eat here again.",

A coworker and I came here for lunch the other day, so excited, but were quickly let down and promptly left the premises hungry and annoyed. You can finish subpar food, but bad food you leave on the plate, pay the bill and leave.   The best thing we ate was the complimentary chips and salsa. I ordered one chicken tamale and one beef tamale, now what I received was NOT a tamale! Each \"tamale\" was smothered in sauce and cheese, I had no problem with that, but once you got to the actual \"tamale\" it was corn masa MUSH! A deconstructed tamale ... so I was really served corn mush with sauce and cheese.   My coworker ordered the beef supreme nachos with queso. He received a plate of tortilla chips with unseasoned beef, topped with straight Velveeta cheese.   Overall we were more than disappointed.",

    "text": "I came to Phoenix with one goal for food in mind...to find delicious Mexican food. To find a place that could rival our favorite restaurant in Los Angeles.   Staying nearby and this place popped up Yelp. In the past I've spent over an hour on Yelp before deciding, but when I saw the pictures of the food from here, the style of the menu, the decor of the restaurant itself, my search was over in a minute. *Wife was happy*  Expectations were not high, but when we sat down to order my wife told me, \"I've never seen you get this excited for food before.\" We've been together for 4 years. I had a good feeling, and I was really excited to try it. I can't remember the last time I've had this feeling for food.   Bridget was our waitress and she was amazing. I ordered a cheese enchilada and chicken hard shell taco with rice and beans, just like at our spot back home. Chips and salsa came out quickly and the chips were so hot...perfect. Our place doesn't serve chips and salsa like this, you have to pay extra and go to the salsa bar with tiny plastic cups. So this was HUGE for us. It's what's expected.   Food came piping HOT, on a plate that was just as hot. Our place serves warm food on reusable plastic type plates with disposable plasticware. We're okay with it, but this place wins. Love getting food on a super hot plate. The food looked amazing.   I dug in and it was delicious. Okay let me tell you, the cheese enchilada was perfect. That red sauce with the yellow and white cheese...hmm, I could eat these until I'd burst and I'd die a happy man. The chicken tacos was solid, it felt homemade. I thought my grandma was back there making it.  Our place back home serves \"authentic Mexican food\", but I honestly don't know from which area or state. I was told the food here was Sonoran style. So I can't compare it side by side, but it obviously gets a 5 star from me, and if I were a local this WOULD be my favorite restaurant. I mean it just made my trip. It reminded me of my grandmas cooking, which I haven't had in 25 years. Lol it was spiritual eating here for me.   Although I ate a lot, I didn't feel too full, and I had to try something sweet. Our place has dessert, but I never get it because the portions are bigger, and we rarely eat in because there aren't enough tables to sit. Probably half the size of this place. The fried ice cream was AMAZING! I'm so glad I tried it.   I know people like different types of Mexican food, but all I can say is trust the pictures. If it looks like something you'd like, than go try it out and hopefully you love it too.   Told the wife that we're coming back a couple more times before going back home.",

As former restaurant owners, we sympathize. We have returned many times since.  I would say we eat here about once a month.  We usually go in the afternoon, and usually have the same pleasant waiter.   We love the chips and salsa.   My husband's go to meal is two cheese enchiladas, a la carte, with onions added.  The enchiladas are very good, with the cheese melted on the edges to an almost crisp consistency.  Yummy.   The cheese chili relleno is also very good.   We've had some other dishes which are average in taste. The happy hour margaritas are tasty. This is our go to Mexican restaurant, usually during Happy Hour.  If you get Happy Hour drinks and a la carte menu items, the prices are reasonable.",

I am from Texas and let me tell you, thats where some good mexican food is at. However, La Fonda is pretty good too (not comparable) but good.   Our group ordered a bunch of stuff, among which was the machaca burro, bean and cheese (boring but good!), green corn tamale, and enchiladas. Everything was great, a little much on the cheese but all in all I would keep coming back!   Oh! best part! 2.75 for a pint of Shock Top? Whaaat? Its not even happy hour. We got a pitcher. The glasses were frozen as was the pitcher which was cool. They didn't have oranges for some of our party though, but the server was really nice and got some from the kitchen.  Prices range from about 10-15 per ontray and drinks are reasonably priced! Check this place out!! I've lived in Scottsdale for years and can't believe I just went now.

    "text": "I've been eating here for years, enjoying the food and the service. This restaurant has always served good family style Mexican dishes. However recently, there has been a change in the quality of the food and service. I'm not sure if management/ownership has changed, but the restaurant isn't as clean or well organized as on previous visits.   The prices have changed, and several of the increases were rather steep considering the lower quality ingredients being served. The beef dishes are prepared with tougher cuts of meat and the results are very dry and tasteless.  This is especially True with the steak fajitas.  There is a lack of consistency in both the food preparation and the service. The Chimichangas are not always hot and crisp,  if sent back to the kitchen the plate is returned hotter but soggy. The salad greens are not properly dried, and there is a pool of water in the bottom of the dish. The whole beans are frequently under cooked, and unseasoned.    If you want great service, ask for Bridgette. She is fast, friendly, and will follow up with drink refills, extra napkins, and clearing off empty dishes. She is always polite and courteous. If you come in once, she will remember you on your next visit. I cannot say this about the other servers.   One server spends her time hanging on the male patrons especially those at the bar. I find this same server very rude especially on the phone. On one occasion my takeout order was completely messed up. I called to point this out and she was short and angry with me. I was told to bring the order back. She wasn't concerned that the kitchen/server had made an error, or that I would have to make another round trip to fix their mess. I would have complained to the manager/owner, but they are not on the premises.    I think the restaurant needs an experienced manager to clean up the restaurant, procure better quality ingredients, and train the serving staff. I would love to see the original La Fonda Del Sol once again.",

    "text": "After a tiring 9-hour drive from CA to AZ, we decided to dine at La Fonda del Sol as it was convenient to our hotel.  We hoped for a peaceful, relaxing atmosphere but were unlucky.  The noise volume here is extremely loud.  Looking around the narrow, booth-lined, almost full dining room, we did not spot any rowdy teens nor partying adults so it was simply general conversation. My wife ordered a chili relleno and chicken taquito; I had a shredded beef taco and a bean tostada while we both went for cheese enchiladas.  The food was served on extremely hot plates (watch your fingers!) with beans and rice but it seemed everything ran together.  We agreed that the cheese enchiladas were good but the chicken was very dry as was  the beef. My wife said she's had much better tasting chilli rellenos.  Chips and salsa came before the entrees;  chips are thin and crispy but rather dry-tasting.  Our server was efficient and very pleasant so earned the third star.",

It was missing items and 1 of the items I did receive was inedible. It was extremely overpriced as well. They charged me $3 for the smallest thing of guacamole and $4.50 for a fish taco that had nothing special about it and was plain. I will never order from here again and was so bummed because of other reviews which had me excited to try it",

The service is super friendly and efficient.  The food is good, starting with the fresh chips and salsa.  The margaritas seem especially tasty after a hard day at work.  I have had several of the entrees, and they are all good.  However, I have a confession to make:  I can't stop ordering the tapopo salad.  It is so good with the marinated chicken, fresh avocado, leafy greens, cheese, etc.  The topping is the simple but delicious oil and vinegar dressing.",

They were busy on Friday night but we were seated quickly. Our server (failed to get her name) was terrific. She helped us navigate the menu in terms of what were big sellers and her personal favorites. She put warm chips and fresh salsa on the table. The salsas were fresh and good.  Portions were large and they were very accommodating for a special order from my son (hold the tomatoes, hold the onions). I ordered a guacamole tostada and a bean burrito served enchilada style. It was way too much food. Apparently they have a buffet at lunch time and I'd like to try it as I have three sons who scarf most meals these days.  We'll go back - sorry I hadn't tried it earlier.",

After 20 minutes we got up and said we wanted to cancel our order and pay for our drinks. Miguel took our order and apparently completely forgot to put it in. No one apologized or even said anything, they printed our check and walked away. ATTENTION OWNERSHIP.... is this how you run your restaurant??? Both of us are in the industry and know good and bad service. Needless to say we won't be back. There are plenty of other places.

The difference is rice and beans, and even though the rice and beans were good, I don't think it was worth the extra money.  Does this mean that the full plate should be cheaper or the chimi should be $1 more?  I don't know, I guess it depends what the competition is charging.  Although the food was good and the service was friendly, we got there around 8:30 PM on a Saturday night and the place needed a really good cleaning.  I was kicking plastic drink lids and other refuse that was under my table, so I think the place needs to be swept a bit more frequently.  I was also a little surprised at how quiet it was in there because some other businesses seemed to be busier.  But that's okay, we had a good meal and I would go back if I lived in the area.",

    "text": "We ended up in the neighborhood on a weekday (lunch time) and we stopped by La Fonda del Sol. We went for the buffet, and what a nice surprise!  They had me at 'menudo and cocido' : ) I must not be very picky for menudo anymore, I thought the menudo and the buffet itself were pretty decent. There are not many options for dishes but they had a very good selection, and options for many ways of eating. I think vegetarians can enjoy rice, beans, chile relleno and enchiladas. They had chicken and beef fajita (hubby liked the chicken better, said beef was a little tough, but you would not expect the best meat on a reasonably priced buffet...). They also had shredded meat and ground beef. Plus some chicken in red chile sauce that was very good too. I was not so fond of the chips this time, I remember them lighter and these ones were more like 'tostitos'... Service was nice and friendly, I did not get the name of the young lady that served us. Overall, great experience and hope to be back for my 'menudo fix'  Menudo - very good ratio of meat to hominy. Cocido, big chunks of meat, too lean for my taste, but at least good amount of meat.",

It was nice to finally meet, Rand H who organized and hosted the lunch, along with fellow Yelp'ers Robyn N and Arlin B.  We met around 11:00, as the place was just opening.  I've have taken several photos of the buffet area. Its on the left as you just come in, near the bar.  The selections were pretty wide, including two types of soup. Everything was hot, as you would imagine it should be.  Buffets can be a difficult business.  You have to constantly gauge which items are being consumed the most and prepare the kitchen accordingly. For the most part, I believe La Fonda got it right and stayed on top of things.  As for the food, it was somewhat basic. But as they say in Yelp-ese, it was A-OK.   The Chicken and Steak Fajitas, the cooked Ground Beef, the Shredded Pork, Cheese  Enchiladas and Chili Rellenos were all good, though not memorable. Our table agreed the cooked chicken breast was the weakest and brought down most of our ratings.  The tab, with a soft drink ran $11.93 before tip, but including taxes.",

The salsa is delish and the margaritas can always bring a smile to my face.  They're really strong, like a good margarita should be, and purchasing a pitcher of them mid-day when I should be working, makes them taste even better.  The waiters are friendly and fast, and I've never had a bad experience there.  It's a casual place, so you can come dressed however you want, and it's the perfect spot for a quick meal.  I've never had to wait for a table either- which is good for me, but probably not so great for the restaurant.   A couple of times, I've come here instead of going to Oregano's when they have their two hour wait going on, and I'm always glad I did.  Give it a try next time you're in the area!",

    "text": "Well I've promised to put a few reviews on here to get past my joining Yelp just to vent my frustrations with one (now defunct) business.  So, I can think of no better restaurant to start with than La Fonda.  I've been coming here since I was kid; it was my father's favorite Mexican joint, and it is now mine and my son's as well!  My son and I have dinner alone together once a week and have made La Fonda our restaurant of choice!  The chips can be a bit greasy (hence not 5 stars), but they're always hot and fresh, and the salsa's hands down the best in town.  None of that cooked, tastes like it came from a jar stuff; just fresh tomatoes, onions, cilantro, etc.-- it's so good, I could inhale it.  Being the creatures of habit we are, Jacob and I always get the same things every week. (Nowadays, we just order \"the usual.\")  For Jacob, it's a cheese crisp with guacamole, for me, it's a machaca burro and a side of beans.  I've had other things in the past...  the tamales are wonderful too, but I absolutely LOVE the machaca.  It's tender, crispy and fried up with lots of onions and peppers.  It's delicious!!  The beans are good too, but beans are beans; it's the machaca I keep coming back for.   As for the atmosphere, it can definitely get a bit loud in there when it's busy.  The sound just seems to reverberate off the tile and concrete.  And...  pray that no one near you orders fajitas, or you will (guaranteed!) smell like them for the rest of the evening.   But, again, I am addicted to the machaca and therefore find the rest to be mere trifles.  What more can I say-- I love La Fonda.",

I was pretty scared when we walked up to it, and was just as scared when we were seated.  Before we got a chance to situate ourselves water & chips & salsa were in front of us.  The chips & salsa were good, not amazing but it was good & i had my fair share of them. I was VERY impressed with our servers speed & attention.  The entree prices are kinda pricey...meaning $11-$13 a plate but we ordered them anyway.  To my surprise the food was GREAT! I don't remember the name of the plate I ordered but it had an enchilada, a taco, & a tamale.  EVERYTHING was good! I mean, not blow your mind you'll never have anything better than this again, but it was very tasty.  If we ever have to long of a wait at Oregano's again, we will return.  However we live in Phoenix so the chances of us being in Scottsdale again just for Mexican food are slim.  But I would recommend it to anyone who wants good food & speedy service.",

Had two different types of salsas...one hot and one mild.  Had two carnitas tacos, which came with rices and beans.  The rice and beans were good...beans were pretty rich.  The carnitas were pretty dry, but the worst part was the tacos were topped with this even more dry cabbage, onion, cilantro mixture.  I had to add a lot of salsa to make the tacos interesting.  I also tried the shrimp burro...aka a big shrimp burrito.  This actually wasnt that bad...pretty simple with some nice grilled shrimp and fajita-esque veggies.  The last thing I tried was the beef enchiladas.  The beef seemed to be machaca and it was tender.  The problem with the dish was that the enchilada sauce was extremely rich...it tasted like a mixture between velveeta cheese and hormel chili, which is one of my favorite tailgating foods...not my favorite enchilada topping.    With the number of mexican restaurants in scottsdale and phoenix...there is no need for me to come back here.",

With that being said, La Fonda Del Sol can most aptly be described as better than average... more than adequate....above par...and a step above decent. The chips and salsa were very good but the pollo fundito had way too much cream cheese. The side of refried beans and rice was perfect. At many Mexican restaurants, beans and rice are a throwaway. An afterthought. Not here. These sides truly stole the show. One aspect of my visit that was very disappointing was the fact that they don't serve Tecate in a can.  The can is necessary for one to smear bit's of lime, lime juice and salt around the surface of said can to truly appreciate the wonders of a perfect beer on a hot summer evening, with the beading, condensation dripping down the side of the freezing cold can and chunks of acidic lime flesh washing down the smooth, light hoppiness that is indicative of a good Mexican cerveza.",
