A young lady, I think her name was Erica, came into my office and talked up this place to the point that I thought...\"Wow, they really must be paying this girl well to talk so highly of a fast food joint.\" But, I took her word for it and I came in on Thursday afternoon.  I LOVE the Chicago 50's style decor! It reminds me of the places I went to as a kid in the Midwest. Everything was clean. And I even had employees picking up my tray and trash from my table for me! The line was long, but moved surprisingly fast. There was a young man up front who I asked for advice on what to order. Even though the line was long, he was so sincere and sweet and suggest the Italian beef. He mentioned that it comes dipped in gravy, which didn't sound to my taste and he suggested having it on the side like a French Dip and adding sweet peppers. I took his suggestion... And I am SO GLAD I did. Seriously, why don't more people make Italian Beef sandwiches. Needless to say, Erica was right. This place is special and I will absolutely be back!",

Im a native Chicagoan and a True foodie. I practically grew up on Portillos. I used to RAVE about all their food. I visit the Tempe location about once a week and have done so for a long time hoping it gets better.  It doesn't.  Every single order I get is wrong. Its not occasionally wrong. Its wrong every time.  I pay for double sweet peppers on my beef. I get no peppers.  I ask for no hot peppers on my dog. I get nothing at all on my dog except hot peppers. I pay for cheese sauce and no cup of cheese is in the bag. The receipt verifies they know what I've asked for as I've paid for it.  My French fries are cold and overcooked.  My beef sandwich is greasy and leaks through the bag onto my car seat.  My Italian sausage is bone dry in the bread.  I don't know who is asleep at the wheel but somebody has dropped the ball at this location. It's fast food for crying out loud not rocket science. How hard is it to follow the plan and get it in the bag? Sooo disappointing!",

They are supposedly good quality, but they were so undercooked and nasty, we could not tell. We had to send the french fries back because they were cold and soggy. The college blank stare brigade standing around at the pickup counter acted like they needed to find a teacher to figure out how to replace the fries. My husband said the relish was scary and he is not picky about hot dogs...he eats them at gas stations and said they are 100 times better than Portillos. Go to Micky's and get a Sonoran Dog!

Portillo's was a staple for me growing up so coming into the restaurant here in AZ feels like going home to a family reunion. The nostalgia is 5 stars Food is 3 stars I'm vegetarian and have been for 20+ years.  I've been eating at Portillo's for that long because they have a delicious grilled veggie sandwich and their fries are my all time favorite. I was told by an employee this weekend that Portillo's fries are fried in beef fat.  What???!!!  I'm devastated...truly devastated.  After eating at Portillo's most of my 43yrs I don't know if I can go back which makes me sad.  I ate my veggie sandwich without fries this weekend but it was a sad experience. I will go back on my birthday for the free chocolate cake which is the best in the entire world but no more crinkle cut French fries :(",

Every time I go there I get the same thing big beef extra gaurdina with mozzarella cheese, large fry with dipping cheese! Something Chicagoans like is there italian beefs dipped in the juice, to me that's gross so I get the juice in the side. It's bomb chow and there is no place in the valley that makes them so good except for my wife at home... She can blow those out of the water. I know they sell tamales, let's be honest if your going to trust and try a tamale from a Chicago based restaurant be ready to be disappointed.

Being a Chicago native I am familiar with the Portillo's name and the quality food and customer service they provide. I have since moved to Phoenix, Arizona and while I'm thrilled they opened \"The Chicago Staple\" out west, I have some concerns.   The employees seemed indifferent. No one seemed enthusiastic about their jobs or provided exceptional customer service. Because I'm watching my waist line I asked for nutritional information, but none could be produced or provided.   Although the service is subpar the food is excellent. They have a wide variety of fresh salads (my personal favorite is the Chopped Salad). However, if you're willing to splurge you can't go wrong with an Italian Beef and piece of chocolate cake!",

This location doesn't disappoint - food and service are excellent. A great value, I had two jumbo hotdogs, fries and a large Coke for just over $10. Waited maybe 3 minutes for my order, and as usual the hot dogs were nothing short of amazing. I recommend the jumbo dog, if you aren't familiar with Chicago style hot dogs...they come with onions, relish, tomato, mustard and very hot sport peppers. If you don't like any if those ask to have them left off. Also, try the Italian Beef, there is none better.  My only complaint...and a tip...avoid the small parking lot by the entrance. It is a tight squeeze getting in and out if there. Plenty of parking in the general shopping center lot with less hassle.",

    "text": "I HATE having to leave this review because the Portillos in Scottsdale blew me away when I first heard of this chain. My 1st visit to this Portillos in Tempe, was this past weekend. I was super excited for I was traveling from QC to Scottsdale and new this location had just opened and I had to pass it to get to my friends house! Why not try it out since the other location is out of the way and FAR from me! I was soooo super excited I think I may have exceeded the speed limit to get there! LOL! The drive through was pretty thorough and awesome when I arrived. You had very nice (but crazy people, because they are standing outside all day in this heat) taking your order. I ordered my norm, chili cheese hot dog and chili chesses fries. My ordered was confirmed by at least 3 different people walking down the drive through taking orders and by the person who collects payment; they were all very nice and quick. I pulled up to the last person who brought me my order (even repeated my exact order back to me), super happy my order came out before the 2 cars ahead of me (how nice and fast) left the drive through and rushed to my friends to devour my delicious food. When I got home and opened up my bad of deliciousness I was completely disappointed!!! Immediate sad face! I received the wrong order! You know the feeling you get when your parents tell you you're going to Disneyland and they end up taking you to the doctor instead? It felt like that, the build up of awesomeness, then the tremendous sadness in the end! I was so sad and frustrated, for you are looking forward in enjoying a delicious meal and you receive an order you don't even want. I received a regular hot dog with mustard.... it would have been fine and I wouldn't be upset if I liked mustard, if I liked mustard a tiny bit, but I completely cant stand the taste of mustard, I hate it. I tried scraping the mustard off the hot dog and throwing the bun away, but it still had its mustard taste, so I tossed it! My chili cheese fries ended up being normal fries, so I ate those and pouted! I know things happen in the drive through ever now and then, it was just frustrating for my order was repeated to me so many times, there was no way I felt I even needed to check it before I left the drive through. Then getting all the way home to eat it and it not being the right order is just frustrating. It's a waste of money and then a waste of gas to drive back to get my correct order. I will try to give Tempe another chance if I am in the area and checking my order every time will be a must now! You wont find me driving out of my way to try it again though :(",

The waitresses were really nice and quick and our food came fast so that was awesome. I had the Halibut fish sandwich. I mean, it tasted pretty average. Very similar to a Wendy's fish sandwich. On the downside, it was really messy. Way to much mayo and tartar sauce, I literally couldn't wipe it off with a napkin. But the fries and onion rings were awesome and my boyfriend loved the Italian Beef sandwich with sweet peppers and the breaded chicken on croissant.

I love to put tabasco on my Cheesesteaks, and I actually happened to have a packet in my purse, and it added the perfect kick to the already delicious sandwich. Very inexpensive, too!",

I ordered the Beef & Cheddar on a Croissant with a side of fruit and let me start by saying it was the worst sandwich I've ever had!  Not only did they not put any Cheddar in it, but the bread looked like it was soaked in water!  Then my co-worker did not get his side of cheese with his fries and everything was cold!  I'm very disappointed that when I called the restaurant,  I spoke with the manager and she didn't even apologize once and simply said the credit card would be adjusted accordingly through their corporate office.  Not even a \"I'm so sorry,\"  \"Let me send you a coupon,\"  nothing!  I'm not expecting my money back or freebies, but geez, at least acknowledge that your people screwed up the order and offer to fix it! Yet she still asked me if I was sure the cheese wasn't in the sandwich!  Which then I replied \"NO\" but \"Do you want me to send you a picture?\"  Their service is less than pleasant and I will not return.",

The fries were not fresh at all. So I am not one to complain but my husband called the manager (Amy) and told her what happened. He brought the food into the location. She replaced the food and he tasted the fries and he said they still didn't taste fresh. Amy then preceded to state she will give him fresh fries....isn't that what she was supposed to do the first time...she replaced them again and threw the bags in his hands as if he were a dog. Now my husband is a big teddy bear.... patient as pie but me...I'm 0 to 100 real quick. I'm glad I didn't deal with her today. Providing bad customer service is my pet peeve. My husband and I both work for really amazing customer service companies and we will make sure everyone knows of our experience so that others will not patron this location. We are originally from Illinois where their corporate office is located and once I contact corporate about Amy's nasty and totally unprofessional treatment. You never know who you know. Amy shouldn't be in management or she needs to be trained all over again.",

I asked for the Monday night rib special and was told it was available if I was at the restaurant, however it was not available online. I think the customer should be treated equal no matter if they have their food delivered, picked-up, or if they choose to eat in.

Person that answered said no, she wouldn't take order, asked for mgr. and he said o.k. Great! Got there and completed/ordered the rest of our order. Arrived home and the ribs were BURNT. I have pictures. What's ridiculous is the cost of said ribs and the fact that we called ahead so as to not be the people that come in 10 minutes to close and order something that takes a while to cook. Ribs were burnt and black, no extra bbq sauce given when it always is, and the cole slaw was half full.  Doubt we will ever be back which is unfortunate since were life long fans of Portillos being from the Chicago area.",

    "text": "I remember learning that Portillo's had built their first location in Arizona. I was at the new Cubs Spring Training facility a couple years ago. Logically, it was right down the street.  Prior to Portillo's opening, there were a couple of places that an authentic Chicago Dog could be found. Most everyone else, from the stadium fare to a few festival food vendors, were poor impersonators. I won't bore you with what belongs on a proper Chicago Dog. But I will warn you to keep the ketchup the hell away!  There are many reasons I recommend Portillo's and have enjoyed several meals here with friends and co-workers. The atmosphere is a big plus. It's what I call \"Chicago Eclectic\". You feel as if you're among friends because it's next to impossible to NOT spot someone wearing a Cubs, SOX, Bulls or Blackhawks shirt. Plus, no matter what mood I am in, they have a sandwich or other option that suits me.  On this visit, it was time to revisit an old friend, seen in the photo below. It was delicious! And I believe the onion rings here are among the best anywhere. They are worth the wait!  I've sampled most of the menu and can vouch for the burger (excellent), the beef sandwich (most excellent!), and even the salads (great portions and varieties!). And who would doubt that my sons enjoyed the chili dogs? Portillo's is a great place for the mid-west transplants to feel at home. And in my case, fills the gap in my diet dedicated to some good Chi-Town food!",

Since I'm a fan of a good hot dog, I came here to eat with a friend for lunch and to hang out. I'm glad I did!  The menu has a bunch of stuff to choose from, but I went with my usual, of two Vienna beef hot dogs with mustard and onions with a drink. My friend went with the same order as well.  Fortunately, there wasn't to much of a line, but as we sat and chatted for a while, we noticed that crowds came and went in spurts.  I love how the place is decorated. Lots to look at with cool lights and the such.  Our food only took about 10 minutes or so to come out and it was delicious.  It was hard to hear the girl call our order but we got it the second time she called our order number out.    Staff here is pretty friendly and cool and things seem to move along quickly. Plenty of places to sit with all the fixings at the condiment counter you can think of.  The only downside is that the fountain drinks are located behind the order pick up counter. I don't know why they do this.  It would be nice to have one located for self service, since refills are free anyways.  I had to get more Sprite and I felt like I was bothering the girl since the counter was slamming busy when I went back up to get more pop.  It would make it easier on the staff if patrons could refill their own drinks.  Overall the food was good here, and I do like eating here when I'm in town. The buns are tasty and make the dogs good.  If was I was still in town I would probably try more menu items, but I wanted to keep it simple since I was starving and was craving their beef dogs.  Overall not half bad.  Cool place and I love eating here.  They also have a HUGE Patio to eat outside at with shade overhead so you don't get hit by the sun.",

    "text": "After all the hype about Portillo's coming to Tempe Marketplace and the photos friends had posted on Yelp, I was looking forward to trying this place.   I've never been to Chicago, but I've had a delicious Chicago style hot dog before. I figured Portillo's had to serve up a hot dog better than the one I had from a food truck in Phoenix. Honestly, the one I tried tonight from Portillo's was not any better. On a positive note, the Beef Hot Dog \"with everything\" ($2.65) had good flavor with all the fixings: mustard, relish, freshly chopped onions, sliced red tomatoes, kosher pickle spear, and sport peppers. My primary complaint was that the \"perfectly steamed\" poppy seed bun was pretty soggy from all the fixings by the time I got home. It seems that the hot dog might best be enjoyed in the restaurant as the bun doesn't stand up very well - or maybe they should serve the fixings on the side for customers taking the hot dog to-go.   The onion rings ($2.19) were pipping HOT and crispy, but lacked much in the way of flavor - definitely nothing noteworthy.   The customer service was excellent! The drive though service seemed like a souped-up version of the In & Out experience: a person takes your order outside (instead of an intercom at the menu), another person confirms your order and collects your payment (also outside by walking up to your vehicle), finally a third person grabbed my order from the window and brought it to my car. This doesn't seem like the most efficient system (and unlikely sustainable during the summer months) but it's a nice attempt to make the experience more welcoming and customer-focused.   Overall: good, not great experience tonight. I will return to try other offerings and re-evaluate. Thanks to a fellow Yelper (shout-out to Irina), I was surprised to learn that they actually have vegetarian and pescatarian sandwiches which have received positive reviews. Next time, maybe I'll have to try the Grilled Tuna Sandwich or the Halibut Sandwich!",

I usually get mine with extra Giardiniera, which is an Italian relish of pickled veggies in a nice oil/vinegar mix which has a nice little spicy kick to it, extra gravy( basically very flavorful au-jus) on the side as well as a little bit put on my sandwich. I don't prefer the wet style, which is where they dunk your sandwich practically, as I'm not a fan of soggy bread. The place is pretty damn big, as I can imagine it needs to be in order to seat all the Cubs fans who come out here for spring training and want a little piece of home when they go out for lunch or dinner. Seems kid friendly and they also serve beer as well. The hotdogs look amazing as well. If you have the appetite for it, try a combo. You'll get your beef sandwich with a sausage on top! If you haven't tried a Chicago beef sandwich, I'd suggest you head over here as I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",

The atmosphere inside is very loud and busy which usually wouldn't bother me that much however the food was nothing special to compensate for that. I was thinking about getting the Chicago Dog before I came here however I decided to pass on that as I would rather try the Chili Cheese Dog instead. I also got the cheese fries as well which was a disappointment. As for the dog it was fine but I probably wouldn't get it again.  On another visit I did order the chocolate cake shake that a lot of people mentioned on here. Once again not really that impressed and the shake was more of a dessert instead of a drink. The shake was too thick for me to use a regular straw and I had to use a spoon in order to finish it. There are much better places in the area to get shakes.",

    "text": "As the Chicago area hot dog critic one thing I've noticed is that when traveling to other metropolitan areas hot dogs aren't nearly as popular other places as they are in Chicagoland. I did a search for hot dog stands near where I'm staying during my trip to the Phoenix Arizona area and found a place called \"Ted's Hot Dogs\" and the next closest place was immediately familiar. It was Portillo's, a very popular and abundant chain started in suburban Chicago that has apparently made its way to Arizona.  I finally had a chance to stop by and the first thing that I noticed is that it's every bit as busy as the Chicagoland locations. The parking lot was completely packed and there was very little available seating inside. There were also tables outside, but people had birds coming up to their tables,sometimes managing to get away with a french fry before fluttering off.    Now, I've been to the Chicago area Portillo's many times and have reviewed a few locations. As a child I met Dick Portillo on a number of occasions and used to be a very big fan of Portillo's as a chain. Over the years, the quality control at Portillo's has diminished. The same quality ingredients are being used, but it seems like the training on how to properly assemble hot dogs, burgers, and everything else has suffered. Or management has simply stopped paying as vigorous attention to quality control. With a location over a thousand miles from Chicagoland I wondered if the menu would be different, if the way things were made would be different, and if being so far away the same degradation in food preparation that has infected the Chicagoland locations was present here.  Upon walking in and looking around it sure looked and felt like a Portillo's. I didn't thoroughly inspect the menu as my order was taken while in line by a lady who wrote it down on the back of a bag, it appeared to be the same as the Chicago locations. I placed my order, and then got into the pick-up line to wait for my food. One trend I've noticed at the Chicago locations is repeated rhymes based on your order number. So they would call out things like \"Number two, your order is due\", \"Number three come see me\". I noticed with certain numbers they were doing the rhyming as well (this must be something they train on), but it wasn't the constant irritation of hearing it at the Chicagoland locatons to the point where you're trapped in a Dr. Seuss book.  Finally my food was ready and I struggled to find an open seat without subjecting myself to eating outside where birds interrupting my meal was nearly a certainty. I finally sat down took my food out and snapped a picture. This was a regular Portillo's hot dog. The problem is we had the same inconsistent preparation we see at the Chicago area locations.  For any of those reading this review that are unfamiliar with what a Chicago style hot dog should be, I'll go over the basics. A Chicago style hot dog has a few different variations. The version served by Portillo's is the most traditional style which is an all-beef natural casing sausage. The natural casing is skin that when properly heated will give the frankfurter a nice bit of resistance and a snap when you bite into it. The classic Chicago style hot dog comes on a poppy seed bun which has been steamed to become soft and easy to bite into. It has a pickle spear or slice, tomato slice, sport peppers, bright green relish mustard, onion and celery salt on it. Ketchup is considered to be the worst possible addition to a Chicago-style hot dog as the sweetness overpowers the flavor of the other ingredients.  So how did the Portillo's of Tempe hot dog fare? The sausage itself was fine, but the relish application was a bit excessive. This added to the biggest problem,  the bun was steamed  too much along with being causing it to become a tad soggy. As a result the back half of the hot dog dissolved as I picked it up forcing me to struggle to finish the rest without getting my hands wet and sticky. The taste of the hot dog was roughly on par with other Portillo's, the big problem being a bit too thick of a pickle spear.   I also got fries with cheese sauce. These fries were a litle over cooked, I'd say they were crispy but a few were so crisp there was no potato paste to be extracted from the inside.   My overall impression is that this isn't any worse than the Chicago area Portillo's on any given day. But Portillo's food quality isn't what it used to be either. I did notice quite a few people at this Portillo's with Chicago themed shirts, Bears and Bulls jerseys. While I'm sure Chicago transplants and visitors only make up a small fraction of their clientele, it struck me as interesting. This is especially True since there doesn't seem to be a lot of other Chicago themed eateries around the area. Overall, I'm going to give my Portillo's experience here two stars. But for the Phoenix area readers your mileage may vary as its unique to the area.",

    "text": "Food was really average but the vibe of the place makes it worth coming at least once.   This place is huge! When we walked in it was almost overwhelming on how to order considering  the multiple counters. The restaurant is decorated neon signs and old fashioned coca cola signs for that classic diner look, and it definitely gives it an enjoyable but unique feel.   I ordered the italian beef and before I even took a bite I had to grab extra napkins because the whole sandwich including the wrapper was drenched in oil. Not the biggest issue for me but I know that can be off putting for some people. The sandwich itself was average, the sliced beef was somewhat bland but thankfully I got the hot peppers which went really well with it.   I also tried the polish dog and again it was excessively greasy... The sauteed onions were drenched in oil but the sausage itself was pretty good. It had a good snap on the outside and mustard complimented it well.   If greasy food isn't a problem then Portillo's is worth going to especially for the diner decor and polish dogs.",

Sandwiches of all kinds - the Italian beef was super good with a little gravy, a lot of gravy or literally dipped in gravy and oozing from every pore of the wonderful Italian bread.    It's just a diner, like many we've all been to for years, but Portillo's has that little extra oomph . . . not sure what makes it different, or even better, but it is. Maybe it is because it's here and it's new and I don't have to visit Chicago to get a really good diner lunch. Whatever . . . if diners are your personal choice of eateries . . . Portillo's is the place to be!",

    "text": "Hello all you Arizona foodies!  Being from Chicago (as many of us are), i was at the Scottsdale opening of Portillos and was blown away at how organized they were.  The orders came out right and the lines moved swiftly so when Tempe location opened I just assumed it would be just as organized...NOT!  The food is the same as Scottsdale and Chicago but this place was one HOT MESS!  Therefore Portillos has lost 2 stars from my Scottsdale review.  The parking is not great but the worst part is when you wait for your order.  You are standing in a small and very crowded area waiting for your number to be called and it was not pleasant experience.  So the next 2 times I went I chose drive thru... this was the WRONG choice....but you dont find that out until you get home and find you have the wrong order......  So, what do I do?  I call the manager and told him how unhappy I was that I just drove 25 minutes to get Portillos and get home to find the wrong order.  Here comes the truly ridicioulous part.... they dont say, \"come back and we will give you the correct order\"...No.... that is too easy, they take your name and information and send it to the corportate office and in a couple weeks you will get a gift card to replace the dinner you never got due to their incompetence!  So, I call the corportate office myself and ask why they inconvenience the customer by not replacing the order without having to go thru this riga a maro.. her response was that the store managers were not taking proper notes of people they owed replacements to and that caused problems....so of course it makes perfect sense to put the customer out of the way instead of just properly training their management on how to take correct notes!  I love Portillos and have for many years but is it worth spending money on food you are not getting?  No doubt I will continue to go back but... I WILL hold up the line to make sure my order is correct....instead of trusting the employees are doing their jobs correctly.  Also... be careful when you order little side items such as \"au jus\".. Between both locations I have paid for their sides many times but never received them in my order.  The food is Chicago good but the management is Not!  Try it... you will come back for the authentic Chicago food.  And so I end by saying....live each day as though it were your last and Enjoy!  Bon Appetite'",

Sorry if this brings you down to only one veggie option instead of three, but it is what it is. Speaking of clarifications, let's be clear that NO ONE outside Chicago expects radioactive looking relish, so some disclosure would have been appreciated. Also, you could have warned me about the pickle and peppers that landed on the table when I tried taking my hotdog out of the bag - I wanted those things on the hotdog. Other than that, this place is what it says it is. They sell hotdogs and other stuff, and it appears that they do a lot of this. It may be the biggest (and busiest) fast food restaurant I've ever visited. I'll maybe be back if killing time in the neighborhood again, but wouldn't make a special trip.",

First of all, its in a high traffic area, so you can't miss it. The parking lot is a bit strange,  if you have a large truck or even a lifted Jeep it may be tight getting into some of the spots. It was busy inside, and the staff was friendly.  My order was taken quickly, just a simple chilli chesse dog, fries and a Coke. It took a little longer than I expected for my order to come up, but as I said, the place was busy.   As for for the hotdog it self, it wasn't bad.

Drive thru took awhile but it's so worth it!! I can't even tell you what all we ordered but our two bags were stuffed with delicious food. The full menu is monstrous. You can order spaghetti! Who knew?? Their beef sandwich is outstanding! The hot dogs are the real deal. Yet the True MVP are those cheese fries. OMG! So bomb. Like I even loved them cold.

I've had everything from the Italian beef, the burgers, the hot dogs, the cheese fries and shakes. Everything is great, the staff is efficient and work their tails off.   Walking into this place is like walking back in time, it reminds me of a ballpark blended in with a soda fountain (minus the fountain). There's tons of seating and even though the line will probably be long, it moves quickly. You're also able to watch as your food is prepared, a point they definitely emphasize as a differentiator.  Portillo's, at least this Tempe location, is a top notch fast food restaurant. If the Chicago locations are better then I'll definitely have to try them, because this Tempe location has always been solid for me.",

The set up seems exactly the same as the Scottsdale location, which made navigating around the restaurant easy.  Options here include shakes, burgers, Italian beef sandwiches, sausages and hot dogs. We split a big beef sandwich, onion rings, and a chocolate cake shake. The big beef had a heaping layer of beef on it, with extra gravy/broth (Standard order, although you can modify it as you like). I usually like my Italian beef full dip, but it was easier to eat it with less broth, and as you ate the sandwich, you would get different bites of broth soaked bread and unsoaked bread, making it kind of like you are eating 2 different sandwiches in one. I got it with hot and sweet peppers, and mozzarella, all blending well flavor-wise with the sandwich.  The onion rings had a very crunchy breading, and one order was a decent size. The chocolate cake shake was everything you'd imagine it to be: Thick, chocolatey, rich, with blended bits of chocolate cake in each sip. Definitely a good way to ruin a diet!  There is a spacious looking patio, and I saw people bringing their dogs here. Since the weather's getting cooler, this might be a good option for dining on a patio with man's best friend.",

The Beef and Cheddar Croissant is the best item on the menu, hands down.  If ya ain't had it, then have it.  If ya don't like italian beef sandwiches, then go see a doctor and then have it!  And their Chicago dog is one of the best in Chi-town, so try it... you'll like it.  With multiple locations opening here in Phoenix, it sure helps me to get over my longing for food from my ol' home!  Sweet home, Chicago... er, Phoenix!  Yeah, babyyy!",

I chose sweet peppers and added carmilized onions and provolone cheese. It's served on a fresh baked roll. I thoroughly enjoyed this sandwich.  The fries are good. We always get the chocolate cake shake and share it between all 4 of us. It's so yummy! The atmosphere is fun and the employees are nice.  There is a lot to choose from on the menu. I don't remember what sandwich I had the previous time we were there, but it was only ok. Next time we end up there I will be getting the hot beef sandwich again!",

I'd give 5 stars, but the tables we had to choose from were dirty, so I am not sure if we were supposed to clean our own area prior to sitting or not. Anyway, I got the fully loaded dog which was really good and filling, fries and a coke. The food was really good and I really enjoyed my company.  My friend and I went to the restroom prior to eating but it was so busy in there! I really expected the restroom to be quieter than the dinning area.  The dinning area was loud and busy. There was a ton of stuff to look at on the walls, so I was completely occupied during my entire visit.  I'll definitely go back, but next time I'll only order one hot dog rather than the 2 I ordered this time.",

Didn't expect this place to serve it but it does. And it's pretty cheap.  The burger was ok. Just your normal burger. I mean, this is a hotdog place, in my opinion. So order hotdogs.

    "text": "Mission - - - POSSIBLE!  Being a native Chicagoan, Portillo's has been a family favorite for years in my home.  Since I have moved to Vegas, the quest for this food has been a bit more challenging.  I placed an order for over 10 pounds of beef, a few dozen rolls and a large chopped salad to be picked up when I flew into Phoenix.  It was critical that the meat and sauce be completely frozen and ready for transport back on a plane immediately.  The order was packed to perfection!  Every thing that needed to be frozen was.  All the sides for the salad were packed in individual containers and all the peppers were ready to go.  Tom and his crew did an excellent job preparing this!  I also took the opportunity to have lunch while I was there and it did not disappoint.  The beef was fresh and tasty as always and I cannot get enough of those fries!  Thank you to the whole team who ensured my surprise office lunch the next day in Vegas was a smashing success!  I will definitely make this my preferred location to stock up!",

Today I decided to try a beef and sausage combo, but I forget to have them add the hot peppers. They usually ask if you want peppers, but the lady who took my order wasn't very friendly.   Well the sausage was just okay. It had lots of fennel in it, which is not my favorite spice. It seemed that it was boiled, and not grilled, which is another strike. The beef was almost tasteless. It only had a salty flavor, and that's it. Since I forget the peppers it left the meat to stand on its own, and it fell down. The worst part was that I was still hungry after eating the sandwich.   I guess I will have to find a new place to get my Italian beef fix.",

I've definitely had great food in the past and the service is always friendly, but lately they don't have it together.   Plus the cake isn't good anymore. I didn't even finish it last time :(. The time before that they gave me a baked potato instead of a cake! With no toppings! I was very sad. And all that after several people made it their mission to find me a milk to go with the cake they didn't give me.   I love the combo sandwich, but last time didn't put in my sausage. I had ordered the big sandwich because I am fat, and it was so lame. It was 75% bread, so I squished all the meat into half the sandwich and tossed the extra bread out. Beef not as good as usual, but I was already set up for disappointment. It was supposed to be dipped and it was not. My boyfriend's sandwich was supposed to be dipped and it was not. Every time my sandwich is supposed to be goddamned dipped and yet I've only had it done properly like twice.  Whatever Portillo's. I used to love ya but you lost me. I will find another good Italian beef somewhere else, although so far I haven't had any luck.",

Dogs:  Crunchy/savory wiener in a steamed but not wet poppy seeded pillow. The most satisfying sausage I've had in my mouth recently.  Or ever.  Italian beef:  Can't find another one in AZ that I know of.  I love the chewy French bread, dry by choice w/au jus [gravy] on the side for dipping. The meat dissolves in your mouth and the sweet hot oily pickle relish on the side is divine between bites.  Ribs:  I've enjoyed two meals already.  And there's still a half of the slab in the fridge!  I tossed a quarter under the broiler for a few minutes last night to char some of the sauce.  Succulent and seasoned righteously but they toss in a little tub of sauce for a glossy finish to a sizzling treat.  Cake:  I purchased a single slice of 2-layer chocolate cake at $.56.  Had I not limited my dessert spending to a single serving at birthday pricing, I'd still be in bed.  Well done, Portillo's!  Your staff was professional and pleasant and the property was welcoming and authentic!",

    "text": "The Good: The Italian beef is really good.  Initially I thought it might be too much food for me, a loaf of bread loaded with Italian beef and juicy juices but oh no it wasn't , I wanted more!  The bread was fresh and had good flavor.  I asked for both sweet and hot peppers and it was delicious.  I even got a fork to pick up any of the meat that fell off!  Also, the decor inside is pretty neat, the wall art, lighting and decor is fun to look at.  The bad: Their customer service.  It was my first time there they had two lines with 2 line barriers forming 2 lanes for 3 registers.  I was in line on the left and there was a longer line to the right of me.  A lady walked up and screamed, \"TWO LINES, who wants to move over!\" and grabbed the retractable belt barrier stand and pounded it on the ground.  It startled me since she was behind me.  I get it, she was trying to get the people to form two even lines but sheesh lady, you don't have to scream in my ear!  Also, the line I was in (left) was moving slower.  Because the line to the right had two registers, thus  moving faster, so regulars must have known this forming a longer line on the right.  The 2 registers to the right of me never called me over, so I had to wait for the 3rd register (far left) in front of me until it was free. Either they need to form 3 lines, one for each register or have someone at the front guiding the guests so they are all helped equally, moving the lines equally.  Finally, when I got to the register to place my order the cashier was not friendly nor was he helpful when I asked a question about an item on their menu.",

I visited this location twice, once inside and once through the drive thru.   The inside dining experience was standard and met expectations, no major hiccups. My only comment here is that when the hot dog prep employee drops ingredients on the counter, maybe they should get fresh ingredients instead of trying to pick up the dropped ones with tongs while everyone can watch.   The drive thru was great until I got my food back to the hotel. My order was repeated at the order spot, the payment window, and the pickup window, and it was STILL missing items when I got back to the hotel. Due to a time crunch for work/travel, I could not go back the 10+ minutes to get my order corrected, nor should I have to.   Overall, it's a good experience and very accurate to the Chicagoland Portillo's locations. I would suggest checking your order before leaving, however, since three verifications of the order weren't enough to make sure I had everything I requested.",

    "text": "From 1977 2 1998 I lived in Bolingbrook Illinois, few years later in the 80's Portillos open a restaurant there. they served Vienna products and were the top dog and polish sausage anywhere. In 2003 I moved to Arizona, at Portillos moved in a year or so ago . I was thrilled at first because as I said they were the top dog in Chicago area. Well obviously here in Arizona that all came to a stop. the products they serve now are garbage no longer Vienna here in Arizona at least not sure about Illinois obviously to save a buck , and the dogs polish beef are no longer the same. I can get a better be hot dog a Polish sausage at Chicago land hot dogs in Mesa, they use high end Vienna products like Portillos used to. Don't let the conglomerate that is now Portillos take your money for an inferior product.",

To get to the point, it was Paradise Bakery prices with school cafeteria quality. There is a ton of hype around this place so I was pretty let down when I realized I walked into a carnival-like setting and spent state-fair money. After further discussion with friends I came to learn that the only items worth ordering are their beef sandwiches. After seeing the quality of meat they use for their salads (dice-sized cubes of what appeared to be the chicken version of SPAM) and burgers (McDonalds beef looked more appetizing)...I think we'll pass and spend our money on a local restaurant that serves higher quality food at equal prices. 2 stars because the service was good and it was kid friendly...that was about as good as it got.",

The beef is tender and the beef and gravy super flavorful.  Get it dipped or not....but always get an extra side of gravy for dipping.  You have to sop up every last bit with whatever remaining bread you have.  The shakes.  Delicious also.  Fries....standard but tasty.

We must have missed the dinner rush because I quickly found a parking spot and there wasn't a wait to order. We walked in and they had some workers out in the ordering area taking pre-orders. I decided to try the italian beef sandwich and the boy got the italian sausage sandwich and a chili dog. We shared an order of fries. You order and then walk down the ways to wait for your order to be called. It took about 5 minutes to get our food (fast - too fast?) We got our condiments and dug in. I really liked my sandwich, get it with the hot peppers if you're into it. The fries were crisp and perfectly salted. My one complaint is that the sandwich was probably sitting so some of the bread was soggy. My bf thought the hot dog was okay. In my opinion all hot dogs are \"okay\" unless we're talking about Short Leash so take that with a grain of salt. We ended with a chocolate cake shake that my boyfriend hadn't yet experienced the delights of - he tried to drink it all so that's that. I'll be back",

Granted, I've visited during peak lunch-rush hours during weekdays, but the system fails (in my opinion) during this time, and I'm still worked up about it, almost 3 hrs later.  Picture a lot of bodies crammed together (shoulder-to-shoulder) akin to sardines in a tin can, but still being lightly nudged by staff to \"Clear the path\". I can understand the need of the request and fire hazard risk, but there's nowhere else to stand! Would you like us to make friends with the folks dining at the long table behind this waiting area?   Lastly, consider a better (louder/clearer) PA system if you \"announce\" all food orders. Why? Unless I'm going completely deaf at the ripe age of 40, I couldn't hear a damn thing, Portillo's. For real. Or, turn down the retro/boogie-woogie tunes in the background because it certainly interferes with the call-outs. Lastly, why don't you do call-outs for ppl waiting (since there's no room inside) on the patio?   Ok, I'll jump off soapbox now and avoid you from 11a-2p (to be safe), M-F. Deuces.",

Earlier this week, I ordered a simple salad, in which they got the order wrong and tried to give me an order of spaghetti. I'm usually a patient person and this doesn't bug me, but fast forward to actually getting my correct order and heading home to eat my salad, I finish about a quarter of it and find a BUG in my food.... super disgusting. I proceeded to put this information in their feedback area on their website and did not hear back from them so I called them the next morning. The lady on the phone was EXTREMELY rude and told me that they received my email and are \"investigating\" the issue and that she's \"not sure\" when the manager will get back to me because it's \"lunch time\". I have yet to hear back from the restaurant, nor have I received a refund from this experience.",

Staff is always accommodating and friendly, and the food usually comes out in a reasonable time. The inside is decorated like a 1950's diner with great seating and the music to go with it.  As far as the food goes, I love it. After you order, you get a ticket and have to wait for your number to get called which can be difficult when it's noisy in the place (mainly during spring training). I usually order a cheeseburger plain, french fries, and a soda, which will cost you around $11. The burger has a really nice flavor to it, and the french fries are one of my favorites. I have also tried the halibut fish sandwich which I also really enjoy. They even have a menu for Lent season which is pretty unique for the area. I have also had their salads which are very tasty, just not necessarily my go-to item. I know they are known for their hotdogs which I have yet to try, but I'm sure they are very good as well. Although the pricing here is a few dollars more than your average fast food place, it's definitely made up for in the quality of the food.",

    "text": "This place is good for those who like this kind of thing.  Well, duh, you say!    I've been here several times with my family. They typically get chili-cheese dogs, Italian sausages, fries, and sodas. So far, no complaints from any of them, and the kids want to go back any time we're in the area.   I've had everything from salads to burgers, hotdogs (Chicago-style and chili-cheese), tamales, even the Italian beef (regular and large... and dry, wet, dipped, etc.) and whatever they call the combination Italian sausage + Italian beef thing. Everything I have had has been fine. I think the chili is good, and the Italian beef with cheese and spicy peppers is probably my favorite. Get the gravy on the side so you can control how much goes on there. Without the gravy, the sandwich can be a little dry, and when they \"dip\" it, the bread tends to fall apart before I'm finished with the sandwich -- and I eat pretty fast.  My only complaints are that the poppyseed muffins they serve with the salads tend to be dry and very bland, and the \"famous\" chocolate cake is not anything I find terribly special. For that matter, the salads have a nice variety, but I think they might be a little bland overall, too. But, I tend to like things with a little spice or vinegar tang to them, so take that critique for what it is worth. Keep in mind that you need to pick up your salads near the ordering line, not at the place where you pickup all of your other food and drinks.  The lines move fast and the people taking the orders are friendly and efficient. The team that makes the food and calls out the numbers are likewise nice, and usually seem happy to grab a drink refill if you hang out by the order pickup area with your cup.",

After reading some reviews there seems to be a misconception about the Italian beef and oil. The beef is cooked in beef stock with seasonings, so what you see on the wrapper and the liquid that comes with the sandwich is not oil. The right way to actually order this sandwich is dipped, so that the entire sandwich gets dipped in the stock before its wrapped. I order mine with sweet and hot peppers on top. It's the best Italian beef recipe you can ask for. Their cheese fires are amazing. I would say salads are the #2 best item as well as hot dogs obviously, followed by the chocolate shake.  Nice to see this chain make it out to the west coast.",

    "text": "So.. I've now been here twice. My boyfriend is from Chicago and sometimes he craves a little bit of home. Today was his birthday so I picked up Portillo's for him.   My boyfriend had the beef sandwich with gravy on the side as well as cheese fries with cheese on the side. He said everything was great (as he always does with this place). I had the tamale and jumbo hot dog. The tamales are actually REALLY REALLY good! Oddly enough, they were the tastiest thing by far imo. The hot dog was pretty OK because it was REALLY soggy. Our fries were cold by the time we got to them but at least the cheese was hot.   This place is getting three stars from me because they messed up my order both times I've been here. This time I drove all the way home, sat down, opened the bag, and searched for my tamale. No tamale to be found. Normally, I'd just count my losses and say forget it but I REALLY wanted my tamale - I really wanted to try it. So I drove back to the location and they gave me an apology and a tamale. Now, it's not that I expect something for \"free\" when mistakes like this happen and maybe I should've checked it before I drove away but I was a touch irritated they didn't offer anything. A soda, perhaps? I know when I worked at Chipotle it was policy to give a free chips and salsa for mistakes and mishaps.   Overall - I don't love this spot. However, my boyfriend seems to think it's pretty awesome so I'm sure I'll be back. Just make sure you're checking your order before you leave!",

    "text": "If you would have asked me a year ago, I would have given Portillo's a hands down 5 stars. Their service is quirky, fun, and fast; their menu selection is great and has flare; they seem to always be busy; and their food is always amazing. However, in February, I took my boyfriend here after all of my raving about their Italian sausage, cheese fries, and shakes. When we arrived, we were basically rushed into ordering and he being a first-timer was extremely overwhelmed. I felt bad and the service people did not seem to care as they had people waiting and we did not particularly want to go to the back of the line. He quickly found something and we went on our way. As always, it came out quick, but when we sat down my sandwich was so soggy that I could barely stand to eat it. The bread was not as good as it normally was and I was really disappointed. My boyfriend didn't enjoy it much which I think played into why I wasn't as happy as I normally was. The cheese fries were still amazing (my mom and I agree we could drink the cheese sauce) but the rest was just average. We split a chocolate cake shake, which tasted great but was nearly impossible to drink because of how large the chunks were.  Basically, I would say, if you haven't been, go! If you have and you continue to have great experiences, keep going. Do not let my review tarnish your opinion. I just want newcomers or people deciding to go or not know that the consistency is lacking. If your first visit is not great, definitely give it another shot! I know I will be back and I will probably inform them if my sandwich is soggy again!!",

I don't know about their rabbit food, but if you're craving a greasy tasty burger, awesome chili dogs, perfectly cooked cheesy fries or loaded up big beef sandwiches, this is your place. Super busy, loud, ample seating and a pretty efficient ordering system are all expected on each visit. The one time I had my order screwed up multiple times, they apologized profusely and gave me cake.  Chocolate cake. On the house. Really? How can you beat that.  I can't judge their salads, then again, I'm not heading to Pita Jungle to try out their burgers, either.",

Just to add I will not eat roast beef or hot dogs any where else but portillos because it is just that good!   Roast beef, hot dogs, cheese fries, that Italian sausage in the roast beef sandwich thing...omg everything is so good. (We need one in Georgia)  Not to mention their drinks are always very carbonated, which I love because they don't go flat by the time you get to your table.

I ordered my classic favorites, a Caesar salad and a baked potato. I drove home, ready for lunch! I pulled out my baked potato, and Caesar salad to see a plethora of plastics and paper before me.  Let me first note, the service was incredible, and the food is amazing!!!! they never fail to bring the tasty!!  however, they appear to be extremely wasteful in their to-go wrappings. For my 2 items, I had over 11 pieces of plastic and paper. Maybe there is a way to better wrap these items so their is less of an impact on the environment??? **Most of the products do say they are recycled, but now they might end up in the regular trash! Nice move, but it does create a similar amount of waste.... Save the world Portillo's!! GOOD FOOD & GREEN LIVING! We won't have Portillo's if we don't have Earth!! #conservewastefortaste",

And then the person doing line behind me got upset because he didn't have enough space, and honk the clacxson to get out from the line...hello!? Who told you you need to be too close to my car? So we are on a Friday with 100 degrees doing a looong line already and waiting for a while, then hey I don't remember when this place stop being a fast food drive thru?   I had on my car my 2 little kids, the reason why I choose a fast food drive thru service, one of them sleeping and the other one decided it was time to ask mom to use the \"toilet\" while waiting, and how do I explain to my daughter when she asked why others are leaving and not us if we were first...of course she was right and of course she also had her own priorities at that moment...So Portillos you are very lucky that she hadn't an \"accident\" inside of my car while waiting.  When I complained they told me most likely that order (behind me on the drive thru) was a salad...really? So that give you the right to skip me in line to receive my order? Hey I started to line first, they took my order first. This a fast food spot I didn't ordered a Pizza! Gosh the hot dogs and hamburger I got must be so special  and unique uh? Let me tell you they wasn't.  So since when the order of doing line and waiting for your turn disappeared? Sorry I didn't get the memo,  Noooo an offer for a chocolate cake slice after I complained for the poor costumer service, it's not enough... keep your desserts, I will write my reviews wherever I can.",

    "text": "I absolutely LOVE Portillo's Hot Dogs!!! Growing up in Illinois (the land of Portillo's) I have a soft spot in my heart for their food and decor, so my review might be slightly biased..  That said, my experience at this location was just as great as those back home. The decor is lively and inviting and the old school feel of the cashiers shouting back your order/watching it come together on the line is pretty neat. Im a sucker for the Chicago Dog and their cheese fries, both of which are perfectly put together. They use juicy all beef hot dogs with that perfect snappy skin and they do a good job balancing the toppings (onion, mustard, relish, pickle, tomato, pepper, celery salt) inside the soft poppy seed bun (the only way to serve a hot dog). The fries are always very fresh and the cheese sauce is pure liquid gold. They do a good job with their pastas too. Ive ordered the lasagna a couple times and I always enjoy it.   But if you really want to have the experience of a lifetime, go for a slice of their chocolate cake. Absolutely the best you'll find anywhere. Its light, fluffy and decadent and the icing is balanced/ perfectly sweetened. You wont regret it. If you're feeling really adventurous, you could also try their chocolate cake shake, which is just as good. Highly recommend.",

This Chicago gem has the BEST Italian beef, sausage, burgers, top notch hot dogs, salads, pasta and ribs.   VERY REASONABLE price, fast service, no waitress service (so no 20% tip) and awesome food.  Did I say awesome food?   Priced almost too cheap, but top notch flavor and service.",

We had a craving so we ordered the jumbo and a regular with chili and cheese.. to my dismay the dogs were basically bare, I'm talking a thimble worth of cheese on each dog and even less chili !   for a laugh I counted three beans with one dog, I was seriously blown away that they were made so poorly, I tried to talk with some kid but he just disappeared, I  think he went to hide ?  I just asked for mustard and added some ketchup and enjoyed them the old fashioned way.  So don't bother ordering the chili dogs...  I should have taken a picture, wish I would have.  Anyway I'll go back,  just for the other good stuff.",

Idk how little the \"regular\" sized hot dog is but I'm willing to sacrifice my hunger to find out! Everything We had was delicious!!! It was incredibly busy and it always is so be prepared to wait. The customer service was good, everyone was friendly. A complaint I have is that you have to wait for your food to get your drinks and the layout. It was hot af the day we went and it would have been great to get our drinks beforehand while our food is being made. Everything is laid out really confusing and I had to go to 2 different counters to get my food since I ordered a side of pasta salad. There's no traditional table service so you go up to the counter and order than go and pick up your food. They do have a drive through if you are apprehensive about going inside. All in all, it was really good and we will definitely be back!!",

Salads are prepared and served at a different area of the restaurant so it can be hard to grab everything when it's crowded and you have little kids in tow.    Will visit again!",

I decided to try Portillo's for the first time and good lord that burger was the effin bomb!! Best burger I've had at a restaurant! Now the onion rings that I got were a no, but back to the burger. A Hey Boo and seductive wave to the person who was responsible for that burger. I, as well as my stomach thank the hell out of you. I even ate the pickle and I never eat the pickles on a burger. I usually ask restaurants to take the pickles off but I forgot.   There were about 5 cars ahead of me but the line still moved rather quickly considering there was a guy outside taking orders. My food was nice and hot. I like the fact that the burger is in a container instead of plain ole paper b/c it kept my burger warm as I drove back to work. All in all, I give Portillo's a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 because those onion rings get a \"Naw bruh\" from me lol.  My top 3 burger places would now have to be: 1. Portillo's 2. The Habit 3. In N Out",

    "text": "Today I tried Portillos for the first time in Tempe, Arizona and I have exactly three thoughts on this place. One, if I had a dollar for the number of Portillos locations, I would have just enough money for a full tank of gas. Portillos is practically non-existent in the West coast and its kind of a shame. Me coming here was a combination of luck, timing, and persistence. By comparison, my favorite place to eat of all time, In-N-Out, has three times the number of locations. And to the burger gods - I thank you so very much. Two, Portillos looks and feels like a causal restaurant, but operates like a fast-food place. The dinning room is large and spacious. The interior decor is totally immersive, retro, and entertaining. And there are tons of workers there. But unlike a casual restaurant, you have to stand in line to order your food and pick it up. And amazingly the food is not that expensive at all and the service is fast. Third and finally, I tried their italian beef and sausage combo and that was one of the meatiest and juiciest sandwich I had in awhile. If you are looking for protein, tons of flavor, and lots of chew thats your sandwich. So check out Portillos. Don't be bored, explore!",

It's their Italian beef sandwich with cheese on a croissant. Sounded really great, ask for it to be dry!  Sandwich was alright, glad I tried it. Next time I'll have the regular Italian beef sandwich. This sandwich was pretty wet for it to be dry? Wife really enjoyed it, had her favorite. Hot dog w/mustard, shared that with the daughter. She also had their cheeseburger, tasted like a whopper! We all shared a chili cheese fries, daughter did not like it, it was OK with me, but next time need to tell them to hold off the salt! For me, this place is OK.

Next you go over to a pick up window (located 25 feet to your left) and wait for your order number to be called.

HOWEVER, if you ordered hot food AND a salad in the same order, then you need to wait somewhere between these two pick up windows because the salad will come out of one and the hot food out of the other.  HOWEVER, if you ordered a drink with your salad AND hot food, the drink will appear at the hot food pick up window, while only your salad will appear at the salad pick up window.  HOWEVER, if you ordered only a salad and a drink (no hot food), then both of those items will come out of the salad pick up window.  Got it?  Good.

    "text": "So grateful that there's a local Portillo's now! I've been with people who aren't from Chicago and they thought the ordering process was weird, but to me it was normal since I grew up with it. Portillo's has it down to a science on how to get orders out as efficiently as possible regardless of how many customers are there. The only thing I order is the Italian beef with hot peppers on the side and it is exactly like the sandwich you would get at a Portillo's around Chicago.   The only con to my review has to do with the physical location of the restaurant itself. It's in a really weird corner of Tempe Marketplace which is hard (or maybe not possible) to get to from the main parts of Tempe Marketplace without going on McClintock or Rio Salado.",

One tip for everyone to use, is when you pick up your bag, look at the number on it as on only one occasion was I given the wrong bag. This locations seems a bit larger and seating hasn't ever been a problem for me. The food is the same and it is awesome. It is very consistent and exactly the same that you would get at any of their Chicagoland restaurants.   I highly recommend this place! Also, they have separate food prep lines so the line goes fast. One line for the drive-thru and one for dine in. Very smart set up.",

A small dog with a cheap bun and a failed attempt with the weak fixings. That's just mine. My wife's Apple Walnut Chicken salad was bland, no taste whatsoever and overpriced. That is all to say about that. My son said his burger was good, but his chocolate shake was not. I tried it and it did taste like it was made with generic Hershey's syrup. Not planning a return visit anytime soon. If your visit was a better experience, congratulations.",

I can truthfully get a better hot dog right down the street or at any Costco.  I also got the Italian beef. That was better, but again, nothing to write home about. chocolate malt was good. I ordered the large which is enough for 3 people.   I will probably go back, but don't see it being a regular stop. Worth a try to figure out yourself.",

The staff was very helpful and friendly. The food, however, was kind of blah. We did get our meals to go and ate it back in the office, so maybe it was because it wasn't piping hot that it didn't taste so good...? But I doubt it. My two other co-workers messaged me that they also didn't care for it. My onion rings were over cooked and were mostly breading, and my char-grilled chicken sandwich was breaded which I wasn't expecting. All in all this place was decent enough but I'd rather go elsewhere.",

    "text": "First, let me say this review is not because of the food. The food is good. This 1 star review is for shading business practices. Portillos uses DoorDash for their delivery but beware if you order from them you'll pay significantly higher.   DoorDash doesn't control the prices, The restaurants provide menu and prices and then post what the restaurant wants. This means Portillos purposefully gave them double the prices (large fries is $5 compared to $2.95 and italian beef is $13 compared to $7.70).  There's absolutely NO need to take advantage of DoorDash's or your customers this way. It's a proven fact that when people have convenience from delivery they order way more frequently. This is counter productive as I will NEVER order Portillo's from DoorDash again and if I want it I'll go get it. All that will do is lower my frequency from probably once a month to about 3-4 times a year.   That's if I even order from you again after blatant price gauging. Horrible business practice.  I included a photo so they can't deny it but there you go. 2 regular italian with with peppers, 2 large fries, spaghetti and a meatball. I understand DoorDash does service and delivery fees but your prices are substantially higher than if I went there and you don't have to do shit but prepare the food as normal and they pick it up.  Yes, I understand you pay a percentage of the order from DoorDash but these are incremental orders. Without them, you wouldn't have any orders from them thus no incremental revenue. Such partners help you build incremental revenue and help your bottom line and have larger margins so raising your prices isn't necessary. It's not Ike your rent or utilities go up with more orders, only food expenses. I still can't believe Portillo's would do this. I can see a small mom and pop doing it that doesn't know any better but you? This is very very poor and you just lost a loyal customer and might lose more when people read this. Pictures below are proof.",

While Chicago holds the biggest claim to the sandwich, I've had some damn good experiences back in NY, but no where in between worth speaking of. Well, Portillo's is much better than it has any business being. Not the best I've had, but pretty incredible for a fast food joint that's supposedly known for hot dogs. Maybe they should rename it Portillo's Beef. You have to get both hot and sweet peppers, and ask for it extra dipped.",

Fortunately I had accidentally ended up in their parking lot previously when trying to go to the tempe marketplace. So keep in mind ther lots are not connected, and the entrance off McClintock doesn't really look like an entrance, but is the first curb cut you get to after crossing Rio Salada.  Wer both tried the combo (sausage and shaved beef) on a slightly crusty French bread and with fries. Definitely ask for additional cups of as jus as you'll want it so you can treat it like a French dip. Choice of condiment for the fries was ketchup or ketchup. The trays are awesome, with four paces in the corners to hold drinks steadily while heading to your table.   The place is decorated quite nicely with lots of neon and old signs. It's a comfortable place though slightly loud, even though we were there when it wasn't that busy. I can see at peak time the conflict of the drive through and the parking is likely a headache. And it seems the seats far outnumber the parking, so go in groups if possible.  There is outdoor seating, mostly under cover in a fenced area, but some out of the enclosure so I suppose you could bring a dog along if you wanted.  As long as you go with the right expectations this is a nice place. We'll definitely return.",

No exaggeration, we waited 25 minutes for the order to be ready. No apologies for the wait, or explanation, was given. When we got home and opened the bags, I was shocked that there were no cups of gravy or cheese sauce. Frustrating. My most recent visit was a repeat of something being forgotten. I ordered two sandwiches, cheese fries, and onion rings. My sandwiches, fries, and all the sauces were there this time. I went to try an onion ring, but I couldn't, because they weren't there.  It's a shame. The beef sandwiches are really good, but how many times can I be burned before I stop going?",

I've never been to Chicago and haven't frequented the Midwest much but this place reminds me of classic Americana.   I always order an Italian Beef sandwich with extra gravy, which just means that add gravy on the sandwich. You can also get the sandwich dry with gravy on the side, or if you're feeling saucy they'll dunk the whole thing in gravy (a little too soggy for my taste) If you like French Dip with au jus gravy then you'll love this sandwich. Their crinkle fries are great too! A large fry will easily feed 2 people.   Ever wanted to try a blended chocolate cake? Try their chocolate cake shake. It is chocloately-goodness with chunks of cake! But pace yourself or pay with a stomach ache.   During spring training this place is packed with Chicago Cubs fans as the Cubs' stadium is just down the road.   The service is average. Behind the counter, they're very much about speed, which is great!

That being said it's a fairly inexpensive place to eat, the design of the place can handle the load well, and there is some surprisly good food here, though it depends what you order. I would skip the hot dogs and hamburgers as both are done far better at other nearby places. The hog dogs at a quick trip were better then the ones here, which is strange since this is supposed to be their main pull. Everything else I tried was really good. Portobello mushroom in particular was delicious and not too expensive, as their italian sandwich was tasty.

Was here for a conference and travelled by uber for dinner and it was so worth it. The wait is a little long because of all the people ordering and the seating can be hard. We were there around 9pm and the place was still hopping. If you wanna try a real Chicago dog or just some damn good food, I highly suggest this place.",

The 1st time I went I swore I would never go back the 2nd time I went I thought damn this is a good hot dog the 3rd time I went I had to admit I am a fan.  I love the Chicago style dog, I always order the Portillos all beef dog, it comes with mustard (big win for me since I'm not a fan of catsup) relish, freshly chopped onions, nice slices of tomato, a quartered dilled pickle and hot peppers all saflely bounded together by a perfectly steamed poppy seed bun and all this for just $2.65!! LOVE IT!   When you check out there menu you will see they have a lot going on, from hot dogs, to sandwiches to burgers, to salads even soup & deserts and for you veggin love fools they even have a meatless menu too, so Im sure there is something for every picky eater out there.  If you haven't given Portillos a try, I think you should, if they didn't win you over the 1st, like me, go back and try it again, believe me it wasn't love at 1st bite for me either but now I'm a fan!",

I randomly stumbled upon this place and was pleasantly surprised to find the key to satisfying my inner Chicago needs.   At the end of the day, it was a pretty basic and generic dog. Sometimes people just don't understand how much further along a grilled dog would get a guy versus just a boiled one. But what bumped this up from a 3 to 4 star for me was the environment. It's a really cool place and I'm excited to try something different next time.",

I didn't get mine w/ extra gravy but still yummy..  Not really a kid friendly place (no kid menu, or child specific anything) which was a bit of a disappointment since most things on menu are large portioned.  Only negative experience of my trip was when I attempted to purchase a dessert. I return to the counter to order a Strawberry Short Cake (to bring home) but the cashier insisted, pursued, bribed and continued on selling me a chocolate Cake Shake...which was annoying after I explained 2-3 times that I didn't want to order that. Which he then said he had a competition going with another staff? I don't know, but I ended up leaving without buying any dessert just so I could get away from the cashier!  I wish he would've just let me breathe & purchased what I wanted :(   Otherwise, everything else was super yummy. I'll just use the drive thru next visit, lol.",

Driving through this area my friend and I decided to try it out. I was blown away by how large the inside was since it didn't look to big from the outside. The staff was very friendly and the place was clean. I ordered a Portillo Hot Dog with everything, onion rings and a strawberry shake. We waited maybe 8 minutes tops (it was very busy) and got out food. It was absolutely delicious! The hot dogs were Chicago Style and had the works in it: hot peppers, pickles, sweet relish, tomatoes...so damn good! The onion rings were solid and were especially good with ranch dipping sauce. The shake was also great. It just worked together so well creating a great overall experience. I wanted to eat another hot dog as soon as I left the place that's how good it was! Overall, definitely would come back again!",

The staff was confused and un friendly it was a Sunday night and there was slot if people but they should be use to a big crowd.",

If the Beef and Cheddar Croissant could hold more beef and not fall apart when it gets dipped then I would definitely say its the perfect sandwich.  Being a man who respects Chicago Style beef and sandwiches, this place is probably the best Phoenix has to offer.   I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a hearty meal with great Chicago style food.",

Hands down the best beef sandwich in the valley!  Make sure to get it dipped for an extra soggy bun.   The fries are crispy with the perfect amount of salt.   Top it off with a Chocolate Shake and you have yourself a meal!  The hot dogs are authentic And actually have a poppy seed bun....a rare find in AZ!    I love this place and will continue to come back again and again.  You can take the girl out of Chicago, but you can't take Chicago out of the girl.  Thanks for Portillo's for giving me a little piece of home right here in AZ!",

The Chicago dogs were the the best I've had to date. My only complaint is the Italian beef sandwich was really soggy when we opened it out of the wrapper.

    "text": "CHOCOLATE CAKE SHAKE - Wowza!   I really dig this place. I am amazed every time that I go in this restaurant, it runs like a well oiled machine. The employee's at the registers are very knowledgeable about the menu, the staff when you go to pick up your food all seemed like they really enjoyed and wanted to be at work. It's just an over all happy environment (even when they are extremely busy.)   Recommendations:   First off - you must, and I mean MUST get the Chocolate Cake Shake! If you can't tell I am a BiG fan!  - Chopped Salad is delightful, consists of chopped lettuce and small pasta noodles with chicken, bacon, cabbage, tomatoes and house dressing. (It also comes with onion and gorgonzola cheese which I had taken off.) The salad also comes with one of their (spectacular) warm lemon poppy seed muffins.    - Grilled Tuna Sandwich, tuna w/lettuce, tomato and tartar sauce. (You must love tuna to enjoy this sandwich.)   -Big Beef, be prepared as this is a very large sandwich. It's Italian beef on french bread. The beef is well flavored and if you add cheddar cheese or mozzarella to the sandwich it is out of this world.   - Onion rings: They are not to thick or thin and they are not over-battered like most onion rings are. They are light, crispy and awesome!  I have yet to try the hot dogs, I plan to on my next Portillo's adventure. Hope you stop in and enjoy this place as much as I do.   --One last time.....get the cake shake!--",

    "text": "So... I had quite the experience here today and I thought I would share it with yelpers of the world. Today on the way home from work I stopped by this location to grab a quick dinner. I don't happen by this restaurant very often as I live about 25 min away. I was last at the restaurant about three weeks ago picking up a large order for my son and some of his friends. On that occasion when I returned home they had accidentally left a hot dog out and one kid had to have pbj. I called the store and let them know what happen and was told they were very sorry  and when I came back to please ask for a replacement. So when I passed by today I placed my order and then asked for the replacement hot dog. ( the cost would have been $3.50) I was told by the very friendly girl taking orders she would let her manager know and I would be helped at the window. The manager was waiting for me at the window and told me very quickly they do not replace missing food. I was a little shocked as it was not what I had been told before but not really bothered to much. She then drone on and on about how I should have held on to a 3 week old receipt for a hot dog if I had really expected to be given a free hot dog ( at this point I had paid $10 for my meal and was ready to go) she said I should have come back that very night if the hot dog was really missing and that she had no power to replace the hot dog she continued on for several more min as to why this was really my fault and there was nothing she could do- she then wrote down my details on a white paper bag and said she would send it to the head office as they have all the power lol. I could not help but laugh the 3.50 had not really been worth the waisted time . I have invested a little more time into this however, to write this review and to look at all the options in the area I have get a hot dog.",

After spending $52.00 on a dinner for 5,  the wait to get the food was long. On top of it, the order was wrong. Why write what we order on the bag if the people making the food don't read it. It wasn't a complicated order.   The food was subpar at best.  Seriously, for the money we spent it sucked.   My predictions is you will out price your customer base with the service and quality of food you serve. You have numerous people working, yet nobody managing how the production is completed. From the lack of attention to detail (Wrong order) to the lack of sense of urgency (length of time to get the food) your company is not worth my time or money. I expect this from McDonald's or another fast food restaurant but not when I drop some serious coin on food.   I'm taking my business elsewhere Portillo's.",

It's casual and it is very comfortable to take a large group (we had a large group, too).  It is a little overwhelming and busy going in there - just so much stuff and seeming chaos going on when it's so busy. But, the menu is simple and it was great eats. I love the hotdog with poppy seed bun with everything on it. Nothing like it! The onion rings were crisp and delicious, too. Everyone in my dining party was very, very happy. Even the kids were happy with their food. I highly recommend Portillo's. Just remember that it is classic food from Chicago and not necessarily what you'd expect at a hotdog stand in the Phoenix area.",

    "text": "Man oh man, do I love Portillo's. Before they moved into the Tempe Marketplace location, their other restaurant was located in Scottsdale - a bit too far for me (even if I'm at the halfway point)!  There are also a couple of other hot dog eateries around Tempe, but for Portillo's it's located right outside of Tempe Marketplace, so I can get my shop on after eating a hot dog (and lose all those calories I just consumed haha)! I come here with my family and we usually just order their hot dogs, my sister has tried their burgers and salads, but she wasn't a big fan of them.  The decor is a throwback to the poodle skirt era (hello 1950's!). It's large inside, and can sit large groups of people within your party. They have booths as well as open seated tables, I like grabbing a booth because it just seems more fun and retro for some reason, but I also like grabbing a seat by the windows because it feels like you're in a cafe. The best way I can put it is if you've eaten at one of Disneyland's restaurants, you have that soft comfort murmur of people outside and around you which I really like. If you can brave the 110 heat, you can also sit outside in their patio which is equally as large. There are fans overhead and the area is covered by a ramada to add to ambiance of eating hot dogs and burgers in your patio (or your neighbors). Eating outside of Portillo's is really nice during our cool months though, it's very enjoyable!  When you go to order your food, staff will be there to ask if you've eaten there before, if you haven't they'll explain the menu to you. When you order they write everything on paper bags - this way they know what you ordered and you won't get mixed up orders when you receive your food in the bags! You have to be attentive when they call your order out, they will not deliver your food to your table, so we usually wait around the window for our food or sit in the booth waiting for our number to be called. Numbers are not called in order, it's whenever the food gets out, so if you're one of those people who gets angry that number 85 got called before your 55, take a chill pill, because your food is coming out, just gotta have some patience!  The staff also makes up rhymes when your number is called, it's awesome! So far I usually order the polish hot dog with American cheese - but I can eat their crinkle cut fries and cheese sauce all.

    "text": "Let me start by saying I was introduced to Yelp, August of this year while vacationing in Seattle. It made a great vacation better by giving me directions and ratings of restaurants in an unknown territory. Thank you Yelp.  Unfortunately, for my first post, I must comment on a most unpleasant experience I had today at Portillo's hot dog. I've only heard rave reviews about this \"Chicago iconic hot dog palace\", so I had to try it for myself. I decided today would be the perfect day since I was having company over for the game. I drove to the Tempe Market Place location from South Phoenix, ordered, paid and picked up my order then headed home. To my disappointment, items I ordered were not included in my take home package. I called Portillo's and explained my situation to the lady that answered the phone and she said \" Let me get my manager\" and placed me on hold. When the manager got on the phone , I explained my situation to him stating \"I ordered items that are not in my bag.\" The manager asked me for my receipt number so I told him. He then asked me to hold while he checked on it. He returned on the line and quickly apologized. He then asked \"Do you want to come back so we can make it right?\" I said \"no, I live too far to come back!\" Did I mention there was a charity run going on in Tempe. This is important because the normal three lanes were shut down to one lane for traffic making it a nightmare. The manager then said, not very kindly, \"Then what do you want me to do, I can contact our corporate office and they can send you a coupon.\" At this point I felt the conversation was not going in a good direction, so I said \"Thats ok, I don't think I'll be returning.\" The manager then responded \"Then there is no reason to continue this conversation.\" So I said \" You're right\" and hung up my phone.  Maybe next time they are fronted with this situation, they might offer to refund the money for services not rendered. Just a thought. I wasn't asking for anything I didn't pay for just what I did pay for. In my opinion, this is poor customer service.",

My dad took my boys here and they loved the hot dogs! But today was our first visit and our order was messed up somehow we ordered a hot dog and instead we were charged and given another item. Since I had never been there before today I went to explain at the window where food is picked up. An employee (female) saw the issue and showed me on the bag (where order was written) and compared receipt and the two were different. She tried explaining this to the general manager and before we could explain the General Manager says \"nope all your order was there I put it on there myself\" then the employee tries to explain to the GM and she had a very no care attitude and said \"everything you paid for was on the tray and if we are missing something the register is down there if you wanna buy something else\". She didn't even care what me or the employee were saying. I explained this is my first time there would she like to come and check out our order and see what exactly is missing cause I don't know what everyone ordered I just know what is missing which is one hot dog. I said if it was missed we can pay for it but I need help figuring out what exactly was missing. She refused. Then another manager very nice manager (female with light red hair) overheard our convo...she offered to help and come to my table. Then when we came back the same rude GM was speaking to my father and husband and she was basically making it seem like we were lying. The red headed manager lady that was nice said ok this is what's going on and the rude GM was still pushing back although the issue had now been figured out. They wrote our order down but didn't charge us. I offered to pay again and again the GM was rude and said \"like I said the register is down there\" and I said ok I would also like to get your higher ups info, she rudely tells me \"oh he is here I'll go get him\" all the while the employee and red headed manager we're both  apologetic. They said \"sorry we can't do anything she is the GM so she is our boss\"! To the Caucasian female general manager, You need to really learn some customer service skills FROM YOUR EMPLOYEES!!! When we left my husband had gotten a refill and one of your employees apologized again and said they hoped we tried to at least enjoy our meal after that! She said most of the people there strive to provide a great experience and she hoped we give another chance! And my husband thanked her and we left! Shame on you for not listening to your customers and furthermore not listening to your employees!",

I also got to try a few bites of my boyfriends italian beef sandwich but he didn't get the peppers at all so now I have to make a separate trip to try it with the peppers soon.  I'm obsessed with the jumbo dogs and also have to try it charred just to see how that is (even though I'm not a crazy fan about burnt food.). The french fries were decent nothing that made me want to run for the hills and scream about it.  Between the jumbo Chicago hot dog and the italian beef I think that has me hooked enough. Still need to try more on the menu since it's pretty lengthy.  Last night I got the chocolate cake shake and good god that's the first time I haven't been able to finish a small shake. Way too sweet for me. Definitely something that's a one and done type of thing for sure. It's definitely got all the frosting and such in the shake and the texture threw me off a bit since it's not smooth. :( not my kind of thing. Weird for me to say just too much going on in that shake for me.",

I did not feel the snap of the real casing on the dog itself, the toppings were sparse, the bun was soggy (probably from the dog that came out of the steamer) and it was just not impressive.  So I suppose if you are crazy about chocolate cake, you might want to ignore this review.  But if you're going for the dawgs, just don't bother - you can do better.",

Portillos was always a popular stop when we were visiting Chicago making the menu quite familiar to me.   I have eaten here a few times and done both the drive-thru and the restaurant. The service has been wonderful every time. I always get the same thing: Italian beef, dipped, with sweet peppers and a fry. While they are called Portillo's hot dogs, the Italian beef is really the star of their menu. Having it dipped is the True Chicago experience and adds that extra something to the already flavorful beef. The fries are also traditional Chicago hot dog stand-style, and I like them, but they aren't spectacular (and who would expect them to be for a fast food joint?).",

So I call and tell Rebecca, who answered the phone, that not only did my salad not come with a muffin as it said on the drive thru menu, but there were tomatoes on my damn salad. This is her response...\"well, we don't serve muffins anymore and I'll get someone on the phone about your salad\" all condescending and rude. I just hung up because I've already had a bad day and this chick is not gonna even make it worse.

They have a massive kitchen with tons of employees working and you can watch them cook. It was pretty fascinating. I had the beef and cheddar crouisant. It was pretty good. Portions are a bit small, but at least the prices aren't too high. It seems like a fun family restaurant. Overall, good food.",

The meat was perfectly cooked and the bun was very tasty and stayed to there throughout the meal.  Very fresh and not greasy.  The french fries were just OK I expect crinkle fries to be crisp and hot and perfectly salted which these were not.  Also you have to walk back up to the counter to get a drink refill while there are 20 people waiting to pick up their orders very inconvenient.  All these people are waiting for the good food though, which is a good sign for a restaurant.  The location for being so busy was also very clean and the employees were very friendly.",

The food is good, if you CAN GET IT FROM THEM.  What a hosed up operation where you pick up the food.  Takes forever.  I am not going here anymore at lunch because I don't have the time it takes to get you food.  It is not from the preparation time, it is from the goofy and incompetent staff at the assembly area.  Food sitting in sacks forever behind the counter while they try to match up drinks.  They get a ton of things messed up.  Drove me nuts just watching that circus back there.  Maybe someone will read this and try to fix and manage that area as the food is good WHEN you get it.  I don't need the frustration and won't be going to this one again.

I felt so rushed to eat because of the overall noise volume in there..sounds weird, I'm sure. But I was shoveling my salad down all stressed out..ha-ha. .  I recommend some noise cancelling panels or something. I'm sure chicagoians  could take a nap and feel right at peace, but I left with a headache and a tummy ache..

    "text": "First visit after seeing it there for awhile. I tried a hot dog, beef sandwich with mozzarella, and a piece of the limited time lemon cake. The hot dog was killer, nice snap to the dog and generous on the toppings (sans relish for me just can't hang with the weird chopped sweet pickles in a little goo). So it's a Chicago place so you don't order a hot dog Chicago style. There it's just a hot dog. Like in China it's not Chinese food, it's food! Anyway, the dill spear was big and maybe sogged the bun a bit but I liked it that way. Definitely would recommend it and at like $3 a good deal. I'd probably get 2 or try the jumbo one if you're not getting sides, etc. The Italian beef was really good. Got it dry with the gravy on the side at the suggestion of my order taker. Gravy is like beef jus, not like thick and flour-y. Not too salty so good on that. Bread was still crispy upon arrival at home. Delicious iced tea. Dessert. Lemon cake with lemon butter cream frosting. Good ratio without over frosting the cake. Love that there's a drive through. They were hopping today so they did the thing where they take your order with folks outside. Great service and quick. Eat it. You like beef. If you don't, well we may no longer be friends. They have salad and it's probably good. But why would you?",

My old standbys are the Italian beef sandwich with green peppers, the hamburger, and their hotdogs.  The beef sandwiches can be hit or miss depending on when you go in.  When they're good, they can't be beat, when they're not so good they're still better than most any place in Phoenix. Warning about the chocolate cake shake!  I love the chocolate cake and I like the shakes.  But putting them together.... Well, imagine Portillos chocolate cake in a cup with a little milkshake mixed in.  Saying it's rich doesn't even come close to describing it.  If you're into a super sweet super rich milkshake, Go for it.... But be warned, it's really sweet... I could only drink a third of it.",

I left that experience blown away.  I went back one more time before I left Chicago and prayed I would get a chance to partake in the Italian Beef again.    When Portillo's landed in Tempe, I didn't expect the food to compare to the Chicago locale.  I was wrong again.  It's as if Chicago came to Tempe.  The Italian Beef is unbelievable.  I recommend upping the ante and getting the Big Beef.  The crinkle fries are good, but the breaded onion rings are phenomenal.   I also really like the hot dog and polish sausage.  And don't forget the chili with onions.  It's damn good chili.  It's rare to see Portillo's empty, but even when there's a line inside or out, they manage to miraculously get your order to you in about 5 minutes.    **Tip 1** If you don't like your Big Beef soggy, ask for the gravy on the side.  And there's no harm in adding hot peppers to your sandwich either!  **Tip 2** Portillo's doesn't serve beer, so flask it or stop by BevMo during one of their weekend tasting sessions for a little pre-party action.",

Close to 10 bucks with tax I got a bowl with a lump of pasta literally swimming in sauce, I mean it floated! I told the guy I didn't order chili and he just shrugged and pointed to some parmesian sprinkle cheese, as if that would make it authentic. I almost spilled the sauce as I walked to my table asit slopped from side to side. Topping it off; a 2x2 piece of bread with a hardened butter packet. You'd think with all those lovely Italian rolls for the beef, they could spare a little more than the butt. It then dawned on me, this is what they cut off before making their signature Italian beef. Pity! I'd suggest sticking with the signature instead of scribbling something and calling it lasagne. Don't waste your $$$.

When I tried to let Manager Tom know about previous bad experience, he just interrupted me trying to prove me wrong instead of listening and offered to remake my food and get me out of there instead of listening and didn't even bother to apologize. It was more frustrating trying to explain what was wrong with my service than me not even getting my food.",

    "text": "4.5 stars  I have passed this Portillo's many times.  If I am headed down this way, it is usually down the street a few more miles to go to Ted's.  My intent was to get some dogs at Ted's again today but when I pulled off the 202 and McClintock, I had a strong craving for Portillo's cheese fries.  Something about that magical cup of hot, melted cheese sauce reeled me in.  I finally figured out the perfect order at Portillo's.  2 Jumbo Dogs and a Large Cheese Fries.  This comes in at just under $10.00 and it is well worth it.  I have had other things at Portillo's (sausages, Italian beef, salads, etc) but nothing is as good as their Jumbo Hot Dogs.  I get mine topped with mustard, onion and that neon green relish.  They are a hefty sized dog with a little bit of a snap to them.  These dogs are laid in a nicely steamed poppy seed bun. They are flat out delicious and filling!  For their fries, they use a crinkle cut fry.  They aren't the best fries in the world but because of the crinkle cut design, they are the perfect fry to dip in that molten lava cheese sauce.  It coats all the nooks and crannies of the fry and makes it one hell of a dip!  I'm sure I will be back soon enough!  Service was very attentive and friendly and this place is pretty easy to get to.  The parking lot is a little confusing if you aren't paying attention, but if you can navigate that and get inside the door, great hot dogs and cheese fries are waiting for you!",

They were also touting some famous lemon cake that is limited time only and I would say it is worth a try. Probably needed some more lemon action, but a good piece of cake not on a cake -making place kind of way. It is the next level cake down, but solid for a fast food chain.",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  I used to live 4 blocks away from the Portillo's in the River North neighborhood of Chicago, and this place feels newer (as it should) but does the food the same way.  And that makes me happy.  I'll start by saying that Portillo's doesn't have the best Chicago-style dog (in Chicago) or the best Italian beef (in Chicago), so if I'm sticking to my guns and the process, I'm comparing this location to the best in the world, and it's not.  BUT, it is the best Chicago-style dog and Italian beef in the Valley.  Hands down.    I feel bad for the first timers who don't know, don't research, or don't ask about what they're getting in to when they get an Italian beef, and feel bad for the restaurant when they give poor reviews because of their ignorance.    Like when you order an Italian beef, not even dipped.  They will still make it \"wet\" by pouring in some au jus from the drippings so it is not just \"grease\" that's seeping into the paper, it's water, beef juices, etc. that keep the meat moist and flavorful.  But really, you should get it dipped.  With hot peppers.  Yes, the bread starts to fall apart, and the giardinera is a little spicy, but that's the point.  You get the spicy vinegaryness of the giardinera to cut the fat and richness of the meat and au jus dripping from the sandwich.  It's meant to be a mess.  It's meant to be a two-handed, slightly bent-over, elbows-out affair.  And it's delicious.  The hot dogs with everything are Chicago-style done right.  Everything in it is cut like it should and in the right proportion.  It's a solid, solid Chicago-style dog, unlike some of the impostors our there.  (I'm looking at you, Shake Shack, and your Shack-ago dog.)  So you know, it's counter service.  You gotta wait a little.  Food comes out relatively quickly unless you monkey with your order with a special request.  It's messy food.  But it's delicious and the best Chicago food the Valley has to offer.",

She kept barking our order into the mic as we were still trying to order, and missed half our order. I kept having to repeat myself and the more I had to correct because she wasn't paying attention, the worse her attitude got.   Our order came out without my daughter's burger.

    "text": "8-10 years ago I was working in Chicago quite a bit, driving up from St. Louis for a week at a time and that's when I discovered Portillo's and that beef and cheddar croissant.  That thing is magical.  Totally unhealthy and I love it.  I think back then I tried a couple of other things on the menu, but when I think of Portillo's I think of that sandwich.  Now that Portillo's is in AZ we thought we'd give them a try and see if it's still how I remember.  And get this.....Mr. M lived in Chicago for a few years and had NEVER been to a Portillo's.  Can you believe that?  So we had to go.  He ordered the Italian sausage with bacon and I ordered the polish sausage.  We also ordered the Chicken Pecan salad thinking sharing a salad would soothe our guilty consciences for eating those tasty sausages.    My polish was about a 3/5.  The sausage itself was great, 5/5, but the bun was soggy and fell apart after one bite and had way too many thick onions on top.  I love onions, but this was overkill.  I had to pick half of them off and it was still smothered with onions.    Mr. M's Italian sausage with bacon was probably our favorite thing that we tried.  4/5.  The sausage had a very nice flavor and came on a more sturdy, Italian bread type bun.  Next time I'll have to get the polish on that bun.  It held up very well.  As you can see in the pic, the bacon isn't high quality bacon, kinda tasted like the precooked stuff, but it worked.    The salad was kind of a letdown.  2.5 or 3/5.  I thought it was kind of funny how 6 pieces of spinach ringed the bowl, but then 98% of the salad was just bland iceberg lettuce.  The description on the menu says a blend of lettuces.  It was mainly iceberg.  The chicken was ok, but tasted a little like the precooked stuff too.  It also had a gazillion diced, tasteless tomatoes in it.  With tax those salads are close to 8 bucks apiece and I'm not sure they are worth it.  Didn't hate it, but probably wouldn't get it again.    I like that their bottles of water are only 99 cents.  A lot of places try to bend you over there and charge 2 bucks or more for a cheap bottle of water.  Overall an okay meal with the sausages being the star of the show.  I can't believe I didn't get the beef and cheddar croissant, but that's just a reason to go back.  They have enough good stuff on the menu to justify the 4 stars for me, and generally the staff are very friendly and helpful.  They are used to being busy and have a good system down.  The only complaint I had was there was an employee cleaning tables who had a spray bottle of chemical that he spritzed a little too close to our food.  Be aware dude.  I don't want my food glazed with Windex or whatever the heck.",

Only thing you could complain about is the line but that's what happens when a place is good.  It takes a minute.  If I ever have had a problem at Portillo's they take care of it immediately but if you don't bring it to their attention they don't know.  So give this place the rating they deserve for their great food service and atmosphere and quit complaining about everything",

    "text": "This was the 3rd time we visited this establishment and while the food is reasonably priced and pretty good for what it is ... However on this president day marked the last visit I'm sure we will ever make to this medium paced restaurant (not quite \"fast\" but still a \"drive thru\")...   If I was an owner I would be upset to findoitbi was losing customers because I've pretty much one maybe two employees. My girlfriend is a vegetarian and we ordered a spaghetti with marinara sauce no big deal they didn't have any more spaghetti so we took the other pasta that I never remember how to pronounce anyways ordered it with also a marinara sauce.  the cashier attendant who rudely took our order hands me the order saying reading back what is in the bag and then says \"pasta with meat sauce.\"  To which I correct him and say, \"No marinara sauce, right?\"   And he looks at the tag and goes \"oh yeah marinara sauce. yeah it's definitely marinara.\"  now my question would be what kind of idiot would actually say that unless he was the one that made it himself to which then what kind of idiot would know it was meat sauce and then say yep there sure is marinara sauce I only say this because I know it was the same idiot that took the order the first place.   So yes naturally we went back and add them redo it but the negativity doesn't end here in that it became a hassle just to have them switch out the two pasta or the one marinara for the meat sauce that they mistakenly gave us. No real apology, no nothing just a , \"you have the receipt what's the the receipt order number\"...   Wish I had gotten the tall Asian dudes name but of the two cashiers working around 9pm on 2/18/19 it was the taller dude ... BTW three stars is for the food and other employees who never missed a beat and even provided stellar service in the past ...",

It's faster than going in and waiting for your order but don't expect a typical drive thru type of speed. The food is really being made for you, it probably took us 10 minutes from pulling into the drive thru to leaving with 1 car in front of us.   We ordered the Portillo's hot dog with everything on them. The hot dog had that perfect \"snap\" that you could tell was there even with all the toppings. The pickle on top really does provide additional salt, crunch and tang that brings the hot dog together. The poppy seed bun is very soft. Because we did drive thru the bun was soggy from the 10 minute drive home and all the wet toppings (tomorrow, mustard, relish). I've had this in person and it was perfect. I'd still order it again even going through a drive thru. If you have a longer drive then that then maybe just eat inside.   The size of the hot dogs are typical. If you are just getting hot dogs for a meal I'd order two per person to be safe.",

After we ordered, my friend got her food immediately, but I had to wait 30 minutes just for chicken strips and fries.

The atmosphere is very diner-esque with lots of framed photos and autographed posters all strung up around the interior. The place can get pretty busy during dinner, but don't worry bc they have a ton of seats inside and even outdoor patio seating too. So it's a good option if you're trying to choose a place to eat with a larger group of people.   Overall their food is alright. I haven't tried everything in their menu, but I've had something from most of their categories--hot dogs, burgers, chili, and Italian beef sandwich. Their hot dogs, burgers, and chili are all pretty standard. Nothing really stands out from there's compared to your average hot dog or burger.   My favorite thing they have is the Italian beef sandwich. The meat is moist and juicy, as well as filled with flavor.   Bottom line--if you're coming for a top tier burgers, sandwiches, or hot dogs, you can definitely find better. But if you need a restaurant where everybody from the family can get something that they like, Portillo's is your place.",

Also around lunch time it is PACKED. The line had about 40-50 people in front of us. Be prepared to stand in line for at least 10-15 minutes and then an additional 10-15 for your food to be prepared. Definitely worth the wait!  Also, the drive thru wait seemed to be just as long since the line was wrapped around to the front of the drive thru entrance.   I got the beef sandwich. Basically a cheese steak once you put cheese on it. Soooo good!  Will definitely get it again. The steak was juicy and not tough. The sandwich was also filling and well worth it.  For dessert I had the strawberry shortcake. YUM!  Couldn't eat it all after my sandwich so it came home with me for an enjoyable dessert at night. Very yummy. It will not disappoint.",

And now that you are in the PHX/Tempe area (even though I'm Married now) I go out of my way to visit with you several times a month. It's ok, my husband and our four children love you too.  I think it's fair to assume safety, cleanliness and quality control are important elements to any business, especially one as successful as your business.     At this very moment I am writing this review While trying not to throw up.  I just ate an entire hot dog and more than  3/4 of a beef sandwich when I found a giant black fly with the most beautiful green eyes embedded in the bread of my sandwich.   I posted photos of him on here as well.  LUCKILY, I had  broken off this particular piece of sandwich to share it with my dog when I found the giant black fly with the most beautiful green eyes.  He was dead of course, probably drowned in the pot of beef au'jus. I'm merely guessing of course.  I'm hoping there was only one fly fatality on this visit for us and every other customer, but I guess we will never really now.   I'm writing this in the hopes that you will be EVEN MORE VIGILANT in your quality control protocol knowing this is now an issue at your restaurant.    I'm not gonna throw up. I'm not gonna throw up. I'm not gonna throw up. I'm not gonna throw up........",

    "text": "One of my friends brought me here during my recent mini vacay to Arizona and sadly I must say that I was not impressed. I ordered the beef sandwich, bbq chicken salad,onion rings, and chocolate cake.  The Italian beef was oddly textured and bland- no matter how much I tried to add flavor (tried to dip in vinegar, tried to dip in their dip sauce, tried mustard) nothing helped so I eventually just threw it out and bought a salad.   The BBQ chicken salad was super underwhelming too. Dressing wasn't that great and their was only a very small amount of bbq sauce that sat only on top the chicken. The lady also put a super whole bunch of hard ass torilla chips in my salad which slightly pissed me off. I wanted to return it But wasn't in the mood to go back through the line.  Chocolate cake had potential but tasted like it had been frozen- had that weird freezer taste in the middle.  Onion rings- tasted like typical onion rings you get from the market and fry up at home.  Overall I didn't care for the food I ate here. I left feeling irritated, slightly hungry, and like I'd basically just threw away my money. My recommendation would be to eat somewhere else.",

Somehow with the way we ordered they needed to void an item but the whole order got cancelled and the kitchen threw our food away. One of their amazing employees named Danny offered to comp our whole meal (per managers approval) and remake everything for us. He genuinely cared to help us. More joints need employees like Danny!

    "text": "I absolutely adore this place.  It's a block from my work so I frequent this place at least 1-2 times a week.  The atmosphere is fun and makes you feel transported to old time Chicago.    While this place can get busy at lunch time they know how to handle the crowds and it normally goes pretty quick even if the line is super long.   I recommend ordering ahead on the app as well which makes things go by pretty quick.    Some of my favorite items are the Combo sandwich(sliced beef with a sausage link), the bacon cheeseburger, their hot dogs and chicken sandwiches are fantastic as well.  I'm not sure I've had something from Portillo's that wasn't good so give just about anything a try!",

    "text": "I've heard a lot of really good things about this place but every time I come by, it's always too packed to try.  My co-worker and I noticed the drive-thru line only had 2 cars during lunch rush so we jumped at the chance to check it out.  To my amazement they had someone outside taking orders, at noon, in the hottest state in the country during the hottest month of the year with no shade.  After we turned the corner we saw a second person standing next to the menu and speaker box collecting money, again no shade or water in sight.  I was completely appalled by Portillo's inhumane treatment of their staff.  I wouldn't treat a dog like this and especially not an employee providing a service for me.  I understand that there are jobs which require individuals to work outside under the extreme conditions of an Arizona summer but the drive-thru line of a fast food restaurant isn't one of them.  So what if your customers have to sit and wait in their air conditioned car a few minutes longer for their fast food, it's no excuse to make two human beings stand outside in 110 degree heat when you have a functioning speaker box and two windows to pass money and food.  As for the food, my co-worker enjoyed his dog but my burger was in styrofoam which is well known to trap moisture so my bun was soggy and my burger fell apart.",

I'm not much of a hot dog fan, but the combination of the crunchy pickles, fresh onions and tomatoes, and peppers engulfing the hot dog on warm, soft bun was satisfying. +4/5 for the dog.  I had high expectations for the Italian Beef Sandwich, as previous tasters made me want to be a believer.  Perhaps my tastes were spoiled by other types of dipped sandwiches, like at Philippe's or The Hat, but I was not impressed with Portillo's offering.  I had mine topped with sweet peppers, and fully dipped.  The meat was moist and tender, and the bun had the salivating texture of a dipped sandwich, but overall the taste was lacking and almost bland.  I'm not a regular Italian Beef Sandwich consumer, so maybe this is the standard. +2/5 for the disappointment, from an amateur Italian Beef eater.  The chili cheese fries were filling.  I'm biased against crinkle cut fries. The chili was the thinner chili; no bean-sized chunks in this chili.  Still satisfied the craving for chili cheese fries.  +3/5.",

    "text": "One of the irritating inevitabilities about living in The Valley is eventually being unable to escape some douchebag who migrated here from ANY OTHER METROPOLITAN AREA, and drones on incessantly about how much better things are \"BACK HOME.\"  Chicagoans might very well be the worst.  Enter Portillo's.  Know somebody from Chicago? (Who doesn't? They're everywhere. Like cockroaches.) Ask them about Portillo's, and you'll never get them to shut up. \"Dis is da gratess hot dug effer.\" \"you kain't git hot dugs like dis in Feenix.\" \"I'd keel yoo for a Portillo's\"  On and on.  It's a hot dog guys, nothing more, nothing less. You'd do just as well from a CART GUY ON A DOWNTOWN STREET CORNER.  We arrived at the new Tempe location and parking situation was a clusterf**k-zoo, which I can't see getting any better any time soon. Portillo's DID have staff poised in the lot to assist, but they seemed just as confused as most of the drivers.  Inside? Holy Crap. Cavernous and full. Very busy, very loud and very colorful. Portillo's has a standard walk up counter for ordering, but today we were greeted by order takers who would then hand back our written orders to give to the people behind the counter. After paying, you are given a number and guided to the other end of the restaurant to wait at an \"order up\" counter. BTW, the lady working the mike and calling order numbers was extremely irritating, sounding like a carnival barker and, for some reason, feeling it was necessary to add a rhyming quip to every number called.  I think this Portillo's was purposely over-staffed because it was grand-opening week, and they were still working out the kinks.  ONE KINK IN SERIOUS NEED OF A WORK OUT was delivery and presentation. we ordered 2 JUMBO CHILI DOGS, 1 LARGE CHEESE FRY AND A LARGE ROOT BEER. We waited 20 minutes and what we got was a soggy lukewarm mess. We were confused as to why were asked \"for here, or to go\" when we ordered, as, even though we clearly stated we were dining in, we were handed a paper sack of food and a drink TO GO.  Chili dogs don't wrap in paper very well. So what we unwrapped was a couple of smashed, room temperature messes with half the chili sticking to the paper wrapping. The dog was only ok, the chili generic, and they were a little too generous with the onions, but like I said before, \"HEY IT'S JUST A HOT DOG.\" In this instance, a hot dog with absolutely nothing special going on.   The cheese fries were hot and tasty with the cheese served on the side (again, in a to go cup). Not nearly enough cheese to satisfy the large order of spuds though, and I later noticed it was the same sized cup of cheese that came with the small order of fries too.  I would discount this place as just another not worth it FRANCHISE OF THE \"BACK-HOMERS,\" and the parking situation really does need a fix. But just as we were finishing up, I spied a rather frail elderly lady hoisting a ITALIAN BEEF, and man, did she look happy. Happy enough, in fact, to make me want to go back to Portillo's and give it another shot, this time with the ITALIAN BEEF.  However, if you're just looking for a hot dog to throw down for lunch, see the guy on the street corner and avoid the Portillo's hassle.  After all, IT'S JUST A HOT DOG.  *********************************************************************** UPDATE ALERT!!! ***********************************************************************  9/21/13  Ok....went back and tried that Italian Beef I referred to earlier. Nope. Nothing special. Not bad, not great. There are a lot of \"CHICAGO JOINTS\" in The Valley. So far, none can hold a candle to LUKE'S Italian Beef.  Just as many employees as the first time, but, even though Portillo's was much less crowded than the first time I went (is the luster really wearing off that fast?), the employees seemed even less organized  Once again, our food took a little too long to come, and was, once again packed TO GO even though we specifically, ONCE AGAIN, said we were dining in.  Overall, after 2 trips to Portillo's, nothing special or worth the crowd, wait time, or parking hassle.",

The burgers and salads are pretty good, too. The poppyseed muffin is delicious - so soft, sweet, and tasty.  Give Portillo's a try when you're on a budget and have some patience.

I'd had their chili once before but it doesn't stack up even against Waffle House, so this time I ordered a hamburger with onion rings. Big mistake.   You can't do too much damage with tomato, onion and lettuce. The patty, though, was overcooked. And the bun?? You know how when you chew most hamburger buns, it stays kind of crumbly in your mouth, like cake does, or bread? Portillo's buns quickly turn into a kind of doughy thick slime in the mouth -- tasteless, but a pretty nasty texture unless you swallow fast enough. So no.   Th onion rings were fried almost black, and apparently covered in coarse concrete. Crunchy? -- so much so you could snap a tooth. Their flavor, of course, was \"burn.\"  Other family members, ankle-biters too, pronounced their food -- hot dogs, salad, etc. -- \"not worth it.\"   Normally when the family goes out like this (10 of us) we stay to order dessert, more drinks, coffee, etc., while we chat and discuss. Not here. We left early.   Overall opinion: meh. No point in going back. If I could give it less than one star, I would.",

It's a bummer because the Italian beef sandwich here is one of the best I've tried in my lifetime, I'll admit.  But with employees like this lady that I had the absolute displeasure of meeting, it has tainted Portillo's for me.",

A creature of Portillo's habit, I always go for the Italian beef with sweet peppers and mozzarella. The shakes are superb. The fries are just ok, and the onion rings pretty good. They'll make you an Arnold Palmer too, which is great.  Service, at least in the drive-through, is fast and friendly. We come often, and will continue to patronize Portillo's.",

    "text": "After reading Joyce W's review, I starved myself all day so I could relive her experience in person.  Upon walking in, I noticed the place was huge.  So many places to sit.  I liked the yesteryear vibe.  Thankfully, I followed a young couple in, as I had no idea what to do.  I found out, you need to walk to the back of the restaurant to place your order.  As I waited for my order to come up, I enjoyed the young lady calling out the tickets as they came up.  One-nine-zero, you're my hero.  One-nine-one, your order is done.  One-nine-two, we've got an order right here for you. One-nine-three, come see me. One-nine-four, wait no more.   One-nine-five, look alive.  One-nine-six, come get your Portillos fix.  One-nine-seven, (I didn't hang long enough to hear this rhyme).  One-nine-eight, no more wait.  One-nine-nine, it's your time to dine.  Two-oh-oh, you're good to go.  When I sat down with my order, I bit into the signature hot dog, and it has a good snap.  However, my beef and cheddar croissant was so greasy it literally turned its paper wrapping translucent.  I texted Joyce a photo, and she remarked that they must hate me.  Yes, of course, it all made sense now.  The bread was too thick for me, and I tossed most of it.  The crinkle cut fries were okay.  I'll try the pasta, ribs or salad next time, with my dog.",

    "text": "\"The noblest of all dogs is the hot-dog; it feeds the hand that bites it.\"   Lawrence J. Pete  Always a great place to grab a quick bite.  Located on the outer region of Tempe Marketplace, this place is great.  Lots of parking, ample seating, and fast!  Pay attention for your order number if you decide to grab a seat instead of waiting at the counter.  I like grabbing a Portillo's all-beef hot dog.  What's not to love about a Chicago-style dog?  It's no Superdawg but it's a super dog!  Mustard, Play-Doh green sweet relish, freshly-chopped onions, two slices of tomatoes, a kosher pickle, and sport peppers nestle up against a hot dog in a steamed poppy seed bun.  Mmm!  Don't even touch this beast with ketchup or I'll throw my shoe at you.  For $2.85, I usually have to refrain myself from getting two.  It's cheap but I like to get other items besides hot dogs.  The Beef-n-cheddar croissant with both hot and sweet peppers... oh man.  Need I say more?  The Char-grilled Maxwell Street Style Polish is pretty darn great as well.  It's an explosion of grilled onions, mustard, and a meaty sausage [That's what she said].    All in all, it's a great place to grab a bite without breaking the wallet.  All that grease for such a low price.  ;)",

The spicy peppers add such a great taste. I feel like my taste buds are dancing and jumping for joy each outing here",

I was quite impressed at their efficiency to move people through and get the food out quickly. We probably weren't in line much longer then 5 minutes and we were closer to the door then the register when we started. Food again maybe took 5-10 min to come out. So no complaints on wait time. Though their efficiency does cause a lot of waste in product packaging. I feel like they could do a little better on helping the environment with different packaging but that's just my opinion.   I ordered the bacon cheese burger. The bacon was thinner then paper and burger was really dry. Quality wise I would've preferred just about anything else. The fries were okay. Nothing special just normal fries. I also got the cake which was very sponge and the frosting was pretty sweet but I liked it and would suggest it to another chocolate lover.   My parents ordered hotdogs, Fries and a slice of chocolate cake. They loved everything. So maybe go the hotdog route vs burgers.",

Just enough time for a sandwich today so no chocolate cake or milk shake. Also can't go wrong with combination beef and sausage or the True Chicago dog. Just look at the pictures.

    "text": "Torn about this place. Food items I've had are alright but preparation is inconsistent. Extra gravy on the prior Beef sandwich was nothing noticeable.  Extra gravy today meant a soggy roll. I wonder if they would provide extra gravy on the side for dipping.   You know, au jus. We ordered shakes last time, a chocolate malt and a chocolate cake.  Hubby and son couldn't tell the difference until they were half empty and the small flecks of cake began to make an appearance.   Service at the pick up counter is also inconsistent.  Long wait the first time here, recently the food was up fir a little while but we were still waiting on the shakes to come out.  Not cool waiting for your drinks when you've powered through a portion of your meal. And most recently, ordering a salad and asking if it was GF.  Quickest response came from the guy making the salads.  He handed me a business card with a qr code.  RME.  So yeah, it's helpful but doesnt anyone know if a salad that contains mixed greens, tomatoes, mozzarella and chicken breast contains glutens?  Is the chicken breaded?   Icons that give clues are not on the menu, instead a link to their website where they go over allergen info.  IT is NOT an allergen, it is an intolerance.  Seems trivial I know, but I cant take a Benadryl and make the symptoms/side effects subside. So trying to decipher menus without a little guidance takes a bit longer when 1. We don't frequent place od business and have menu memorized, 2. multiple staff AND management have absolutely no clue and stand by cashier who's taking our order BUT hesitant to add it in because everyone is uncertain - mgr and another staff member have retreived nutritional info and are standing nearby, reading over it togwther in an attempt to find answers..., 3. other customers are waiting for us to complete our order and pay.   It gets to the point where you just say screw it, that's what i want, so you can be done with all of this. Had I been dining alone I would have just left. On this occasion I was in the mood for that jumbo chili dog and what was served up was the standard.  Large Diet Coke came out Root Beer, with the \"D\"  notation on the lid.  But hey, I got my water right.",

It also didn't help that it was about an hour before ASU - Wisconsin kicked of at Sun Devil Stadium about a mile down the road in Tempe.   Service was amazing. But with the approximately 70 employees I saw, anything less would have been unacceptable. Shit, I counted about 15 management and corporate types alone all gathered around patting themselves on the back.   Unfortunately, the service is where the amazing ended. Food was...average. One of our daughters wanted chicken tenders, and they were among the worst I'd ever had. Onion rings sucked too. My wife and I each had a jumbo and they were ok - but certainly nothing even remotely close to special. If you're looking for better, it shouldn't be too hard to find. Ted's in Tempe has far better dogs and onion rings. And if it's Chicago dogs you're looking for, Jimmy's at 40th and B-way is vastly superior.",

Although the AZ staff doesn't quite stand up to the real Portillo's back home, they do pretty well. They did screw up the Maxwell Polish, suppose to be sauteed onion & Mustard on a hard roll, but they use a hotdog bun and burned both the onion and polish. They've screwed up a couple of orders (when it wasn't busy) and also have people in the drive through when it was dead. Back home they only do that when it's busy, which works great. When I'm the only one in the drive through, just let me order at the menu, I don't need 3 different people serving me.   Inside, the area where you collect your food is too small, they need to clear out a couple of tables, people are standing on top of each other when it's busy.

Sorry kids - the only thing that's missing are the rides.

Ordered the cheese fries, strawberry malt shake, chili cheese dog and the italian beef and sausage sandwich extra wet.  The fries were good with the cheese dip, it was kind of like nacho cheese.  The sandwich had sweet peppers and onions and she added cheese for us,  mozzarella I believe and that was hearty but the flavor was very mild, really thought it would have a heavy flavor impact.  The chili dog according to the BF was good since he ate it all. That hotdog we ordered with grilled onions. Now the malt shake... that was really good.  Could really taste the malt in it!! Didnt have room to try the desserts but looked really good! Cute atmosphere and love the decor.  The staff was very friendly and really enjoyed dinning in!",

    "text": "Every time my boyfriend and I swing by Tempe Marketplace, we always see Portillos around and we would often wonder how this place would taste. We had never heard of Portillos as we're not from the Chicago (nor have we even visited there).  However, it very much was how we both expected. It's a very casual place where friends and family can settle down and have some fast food after a day of shopping. It's a nice idea but it's sort of out of the way for us since my boyfriend and I always go towards the main marketplace to shop or browse around.  I ordered a hamburger while my boyfriend ordered a combo (a hot dog with an Italian sausage and some roast beef). We had initially thought the combo was going to come with some fries and a drink but only I got the fries, as it came with my meal apparently, and I had to order us a drink. It's not a big deal or anything! I guess he and I misunderstood this kind of lingo, haha.  The burger was okay; it's a step up from McDonalds but that's all I can really say about it. The fries were average, but both the burger and fries were at least fresh. The hot dog my boyfriend was surprisingly good - only because we've been burnt before with restaurants who try to mimic others only in looks and not taste.  If we're not really feeling the other restaurants in Tempe Marketplace, I believe we'd come here just to get more of those infamous hot dogs.",

The manager wants to please us and it must be working we keep trying!  We have gotten lasagna free, a dinner free and a salad free all due to massive errors and excessive wait times. Again the food they advertise is exactly what you get and tastes perfect. You likely will not get what you order or it can be a 20 minute wait in drive thru. They also lost a call in order, never \"got\" order via yelp, didn't get an internet order via their web site, and forgot half my order. So the lesson... eat inside so you can give them back the wrong food and get the correct food. Don't leave the drive thru window until you see everything you requested. It may be someone else's meatball sub! If you like my reviews follow me! Thanks",

I also had a chili cheese dog that was fine but nothing amazing.  The sandwich was 5 stars and the hot dog was 3. It is a very peculiar layout, and parking here is a pain.  Once you get in though, there are a ton of tables to sit at (there is plenty of seating inside and outside).  As you walk in, where you actually order is all the way across several thousand square feet of space.  You might be thinking to yourself, \"well you must have gone through the side entrance\".  That may be the case, but since that is where all the parking is that is where all the customers come through.  The service was ok, I mentioned it was my first time and that didn't elicit a reaction.  After you order you have to walk by the production line to where you pick up your food, and it's encased in glass so you can watch the production magic happening.  BUT you are being yelled at by the crew at the pick up area not to congregate there.  Ok I get it you don't want to clog up the lane, but once again just a really awkward design.  I enjoyed all the photos with celebrities and the founder of Portillo's.  I enjoy the nostalgia.  Solid food, but a really funky layout.",

If you are a fan of Portillo's, this Portillo's is no different.  The things that I don't like about this Portillo's mostly stem from its location.    The parking situation is really bad.  You have to enter from a side street or make a quick right after the intersection at McClintock and Rio Salado.  I have seen so many near-miss accidents in this parking lot.  I have also almost been hit when walking from my car into the restaurant when walking past the drive thru, even while on the path.    If you happen to miss the entrance into Portillo's, you would have to brave the Tempe Marketplace parking lot and then walk between buildings to get back into Portillo's lot.    I recommend the italian beef with hot giardiniera, the beef and cheddar croissant and the onion rings.  My mom recommends the chopped salad.    I do not recommend the chicken anything here.  The chicken tenders are always dry and the chicken sandwich is boring.  The fries are decent, but the cheese fries have a cup of \"nacho cheese\" to dip them in.  I would prefer melted cheese on my fries to that disgusting stuff.    I have been to this Portillo's several times.  I will return.",

I ordered a hot dog (the lady who helped me said it was their flagship dish) an also ordered a cheese burger for my companion. I also got cheesy fries.  After a long wait because they wrote the wrong number in my order (no apologize, effort to make up, anything) I told the people over there two times that I thought my order was the one that has been sitting there forever. They called the number again and finally gave it to me.  The styrofoam cup for my drink make me start thinking that that place wasn't as great as I've heard but I continued to my table. I mean, I'm not a tree hugger but styrofoam is a little too much. When we arrived to the table I opened the bag and I saw that the burger was also in a styrofoam box. I mean, even one of the public enemies, the one with the golden arches, quit using this s!@#t like back in the 80's, AYFKM, Portillo's?  Now the food. The hot dog was totally uneventful and super small (super cheap as well, but I didn't want to make the line again).  The burger also forgettable as well as the fries.  After posting on FB that I wasn't impressed, some people told me to try the beef sandwich.  I might do it and might update this post.  Not impressed at all.",

Walking in, we were overwhelmed with the large size of the restaurant, and the amazing amount of decor and memorabilia items covering the walls and ceiling.   You order at the registers and wow - their menu is WAY more than dogs and fries. Pasta, salads, burgers....but really, who orders anything but a hot dog at this place? We both got regular sized dogs and I got a side of onion rings with mine.  The dogs were good! Nothing out of this world, but definitely fresh tasting and yummy for sure. Pretty sure I will order the \"jumbo\" size next time, though. I wasn't overly thrilled with the onion rings...they didn't seem super fresh to me - I like my onion rings golden brown and piping hot.  I will definitely be back - great bang for your buck! We left with full tummies, but didn't feel overly stuffed, which is always a plus :)",

The line was long but we all had our food in less than 10 minutes.  The staff was smiling and very helpful.  The food....It was awesome.  I got the Italian Beef with hot peppers and it was phenomenal!  I'm pretty sure I inhaled it without chewing enough it was that good.

Anyway, they write your order on a bag in their own shorthand so it was not possible to know if she wrote it wrong or not. Either way, sucked to get a whatever dog with all kinds of stuff to pick off. Dog was just ok and I would have said 3 stars if my order had been correct. I should have looked at the receipt I suppose, before assuming. Average at best. Might be back to try the Italian Beef.  Also the fries tasted like high school food.",

We walked in, and it's a bit confusing if it's your first time and no one is there to direct you. You order at towards the far left end of the joint, and then wait on the near left (if that makes any sense) to pick up. We were approached by a employee with a menu just before placing our order: italian beef dry w/sauce on the side, chicago dog, and onion rings.   Took at seat (there was plenty of seating, but lots of signs saying not to take a seat until your order was placed?), and about 5 mins later, our order was ready. everything was hot, but it was all in a take out bag. I looked around, and everyone's food is in a takeout bag. A bit strange. Chicago dog - good, love all the toppings. Dog could have had a bit more snap, but good flavor. Onion rings were awesome! Italian beef - we like it with the sauce so we can dip it ourselves and the bread doesn't get soggy. I know, that's not the \"proper\" way, but it's the way we like it. It's like a french dip with some italian seasonings on it.  Food:price was reasonable.  Quick, casual place to get a bite to eat.",

That said, I wouldn't order the Italian beef without the sausage. Adding the sausage knocked the flavor several notches. I also tossed some cheese on there. It was great!  I thought the fires were disappointing. I did however enjoy the set up and overall feel of the restaurant. I'd definitely go back. I'd like to try some of their other menu items. The options were quite extensive.",

Absent the place I grew up with, Portillo's is an excellent replacement. Can't go wrong with the Italian Beef. Tastes like Chicago.",

Meh yet again. I know what y'all are thinking.  Why didnt you have the hot dog?  THAT'S WHAT THEY DO BEST!  A Chicago style hot dog has 2 main things which I cant stand.  Mustard and pickles.

    "text": "Of course I love Portillo's and their menu and thank Dick Portillo endlessly for making the phoenix metro area an official suburb of Chicago.  That said I did some experimenting with making Chicago dogs at home and wanted to offer the results of my yummy research. I ordered a hot dog kit from Vienna Beef online which comes with buns, dogs, and toppings. These are the ingredients you need to nearly duplicate at home what you can get at Portillo's: Vienna Beef Natural Casing Weiners (not the skinless ones or the ones in the grocery store), Vienna Beef hot dog buns, and their sport peppers in the jar. Everything else you can get at the grocery store and your dogs will taste pretty darn close to Portillo's at home. Any yellow mustard is fine, any celery salt, any onion chunks, any tomato slice, almost any non sweet relish is fine - a yellow relish may even be better. And for a pickle slice, you really should use Clausen Kosher dill pickles, the ones that are refrigerated at the store - always rotate the jar and look for brown spots caused by lack of refrigeration when shipped to the store. I got a cheap steamer for dogs and buns on Amazon but you can make one with alumunim foil or a food strainer over a pot of simmering water. Steam the buns for maybe 2 minutes and the dogs until they're hot. Since catsup is 99% tomato I think the anti-catsup thing is total hype as long as you dont grab one of the sweeter catsups. Heinz sells one at many stores marked Reduced Sugar which lowers the carbs and doesn't taste like catsup flavored candy. There are some Vienna Beef hot dog places here in the phoenix metro where you can order bulk items directly from Vienna Beef in Chicago instead of ordering from them and waiting on the fedex truck.  The two most important ingredients are: vienna beef natural casing weiners and vienna beef hot dog buns. ( the poppy seeds add no flavor or texture and are only for appearance)  Happy eating - God Bless Portillo's!",

They serve hot dogs, Italian beef and sausage, hamburgers, chicken sandwiches, and even salads here but I always stick to the Italian Beef and Sausage combo. It comes with hot or sweet peppers and gravy (au jus) but you can choose to get it dry or on the side if you prefer. There is a mixture of shredded Italian beef and an Italian sausage all tucked into one roll that is delicious. I meant to get a picture of the sandwich but we dug into our food so quick!  French fries are served hot and are tasty. Sodas come with free refills but you have to go up to the counter and have an employee refill for you.   The Cake Shake is popular though I've never had it. Think milkshake mixed with a blended piece of chocolate cake.   Located in Tempe Marketplace so there are many other restaurants around but I choose Portillo's every time I'm here.",

Staff was friendly, seating was open and ample, service was quick, and the food was spot on delicious. I ordered a couple Chicago dogs with some of the crispiest and best fries I've ever had. The flavor profile of the Chicago dog with the pickle, relish, pepper, mustard, tomato, can't be beat. I'm still thinking about it a couple days later. Next time I'm trying one of their famous Italian beef sandwiches. Although there are ample meal options for my vegetarian wife (pasta anyone?) she went with a salad. A SALAD? Yes, a salad. But this was not your average dinner salad--she ordered the chopped salad with romaine, iceberg, Ditalini pasta, Gorgonzola, green onion, red cabbage and house dressing. (Chicken and crispy bacon on the side). It came in a huge bowl and a side of bread and butter. She loved it.   Full menu is also available through their quick and convenient drive through if you don't have time to stop in. Also, don't forget to sign up online for their birthday club for your free slice of chocolate cake.",

It's cooked to order including the salads which are made in front of you. You don't come here to get diet food either. Everything is great on the menu but my favorites are the hot dog, beef and chopped salad. Of course who can't forget the chocolate cake. Hot dogs have that snap you are looking for and for the love of god, do NOT put ketchup on it. Beef is always enjoyable dipped. Dipped means a nice au jus soaked bun. Soaked enough to enjoy it but not so it's falling apart. Love the cheese fries. Did I mention the chocolate cake? Tons of parking. Super friendly service.",

We ordered the cheese fries and the cheese was on the side, but mixed with the salty cheese was just too much. I've been to 2 Portillo's and they were both painfully sub par. I paid $7 for a \"jumbo\" hot dog and a drink. Wasn't even that big. Still hungry. The bun fell apart and couldn't contain everything. What a poor excuse for a Chicago style hotdog. Gave this place 3 chances and was upset I didn't just go to QT for some hotdogs. Again, not awful. Just not worth the trip, the wait and the money.",

There's lots options on the menu but my go to is the Italian beef with hot peppers (giardinieria) that's been dipped in the gravy. It's wet, messy but oh so delicious. If you add fries and a milk shake you'll probably be downing 3000 to 4000 calories. But you'll be oh so happy! The Chicago style got dogs are great, cheddar beef is a buttery taste sensation.",

Portillo's offers a drive-thru service as well as a very large indoor/outdoor seating area to enjoy the food. The crinkle cut fries are a must, and expect your hot dog to be served Chicago style (sport peppers, onions, celery salt, etc.) but they can make it the way you like. We visited Portillo's on a Saturday around 1:30p and the place was packed. It's extremely noisy so the ordering process was a little annoying. Be prepared to shout what you want during busy hours. It's also hard to hear your order number called out. It's all counter service, but the folks behind the counters seemed friendly enough. There are \"stewards\" near the ordering line to help first timers figure out the menu. I saw a pretty decent salad station that seemed to make some pretty nice looking salads if you want to watch the calories. We'd come back- the price was right... $21 for a family of 3. They also serve malts and shakes, those looked to be a popular item. The patio is decent sized and had space heaters for the cooler weather. I'd bet this place is really popular during MLB spring training season with all the snowbirds. Have fun!",

I don't go to the mall too often but when I do, Portillo's would certainly be a reasonable option. For what it is, this is a good food experience and if you like hot dogs, you definitely should give this place a try. Only thing, it would be nice if they had their menu online so one could say, pre-select some healthier options and I am not sure they offer a veggie dog option. My parents are cutting meat out of their diet so a vegi dog would be a nice alternative.",

The bonus here is Tempe Marketplace is within walking distance. Perfect when you need to work off some of those delicious calories.  Normally order the Italian Beef with both Sweet and Hot Peppers and get it DIPPED. Sometimes like to add Cheese or even go BIG BEEF when I'm feeling unusually hungry. On other visits it is hard not to resist a few Chi Dogs with some Cheese Fries on the side. They even have a jumbo version of the DOG. Other selections include Burgers, Chicken, Fish, Veggie Sandwiches and a nice selection of healthy Salads.  Service is quick and friendly and your order shows up almost instantly at the next window. My only pet peeve is that the food is always wrapped up and put in a paper bag. Lets just say the chili dogs and other items can get a little messy as they tackle each other in order to get a good home field advantage for the team. Da BEARS!  Don't forget a piece of Chocolate Cake or one of their famous Shakes before you leave. This place is fun and is definitely on my work time lunch rotation.  New CUBS spring training facility to open up right down the street. It is going to be packed with tons of people who enjoy great baseball and know how to eat.

    "text": "The plan the other Saturday night was to go get burgers from In & Out and bring them back to the house.  However, due to events taking place around ASU that night and the next day (ASU Homecoming and some race the next day), I was unable to get off on Scottsdale road.  And all of the surrounding streets were closed too.  BIG Cluster F.    After sitting in traffic for almost an hour trying to get back to the 202, I get back to Hayden/McClintock road.  I see the new Portillo's and give J a quick call to see if that was an okay substitute for him, to which it was.   They have a drive-thru which is nice and if it is during a peak time, they have people standing outside waiting to take your order instead of ordering at the squakbox (like In&Out).  If you've never been though, you feel pressed to make a quick meal decision - Which I was for mine and  C's meals as J had checked out their menu online and texted me his order.    I ordered 2 chili cheese dogs, a regular hot dog, the poppyseed fruit with chicken salad, and an order of fries.  I found it odd that they do not have kids meals at Portillo's.  I will say that C liked the hot dog.  But to be honest, I could just buy a package of Nathan's Famous and make these dogs at home (chili and chicago).  J felt the same way about his chili dogs (which ended up falling apart).  And the fries, I could order the same fries at Del Taco for the same price.  Or better yet, make them at home.    The salad I ordered sounded similar to the Strawberry poppyseed seasonal (summer only) salad I fell in love with at Paradise.  BOY was I wrong.  The chicken resembled flash frozen chicken.  You know the kind you can get in the freezer section, you just reheat it and use as you like.  Terrible.  The only positive thing about the salad was the cheese (which there was only a sprinkle of) and fruit, which I ended up sharing with C.   The glazed walnuts, there were maybe 4 or 5 pieces in my salad.  OH..they gave you a lemon poppy muffin with the salad.  Big Whoop.    For the price we paid ($20+), we were all in all disappointed in our dinner and probably wont be returning.",

But the bun was soggy and the a jous was really oily and watery, really without much flavor. The dog was just average. But I can have average for 50 cents in my yard, so why go out? SO I give it three because my middle USA friends get their hometown thing and I get mine. Its all about sharing, caring and inner peace, right?",

    "text": "So with all the hype in Scottsdale -another Portillo's has opened in Tempe for us East Valley peeps!  All I can say is what a fun and sassy place it is! While we drove into the parking lot we saw some officers directing traffic which made it nice. Once we were parked, we were impressed with all the outside seating with misters.... Everyone knows it's HOT here!  When we walked in we were overwhelmed with all the people and quickly realized that we needed to get in line to order. While we stood there a man came up and asked us if we were ready to order, and I said no since I hadn't even had a chance to look at the menu :? So he quickly got us a menu and we decided and got in line to be greeted by a wonderful young lady who tool our order on a bag! Than we were handed our bag and headed to the line to check out. Less than 5 second wait and we stepped into the Pick up line.... Daughter went to the Salad line to get her Salad :)  Within approximately 4 minutes they called our random number for our food and off to the table we went!  We all dug into our food!  I had the Italian Beef (DIPPED!), with mozzarella and onions and a side of onion rings. Hubby had the Hot dog with mustard, yellow onion, and pickle, along with a Combo Beef and Char-Grilled Sausage and a side of fries. DD got the Garden salad, and DS got Chicken Tenders and Fries....  I enjoyed mine a lot! Very flavorful. I do think the onion rings might need a different type of batter, just not the way I like them.  Hubby loved his completely! I think the fries could have been cooked or browned a little more - Personal preference.... DD loved her salad, very fresh! DS did not care for his chicken fingers :(  Next time I asked him to try something else :)  Over all I think this is a great addition to the area. I had the opportunity to talk to Sharon (owner) and saw Dick Portillo walking and mingling with guests. You can see they are taking a lot of pride int heir new establishment and I can't wait to come back to Portillo's!",

    "text": "Officially a stalker of Portillo's.  Officially.  My friend, who is a Chicagoan, brought me here a couple weeks ago to pop my Chicago Dog cherry.  It was completely and utterly worth the drive!    I am a fairly plain hot dog type of person...ketchup, mustard, relish, that's it.   But I am one of those when in Rome type folks.  So, I went balls to the wall and got the full on Chicago dog with all the toppings.  Tomatoes. Pickle.  Green relish. Sport peppers. Onions. Steamed poppy seed bun.  BEST HOT DOG EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!  These aren't anything like stadium hot dogs, Wienerschnitzel dogs, or those hot dogs that have buns that fall apart at family barbeques.  No siree bob.  I only wish I would have ordered two.  They make a mean Arnold Palmer.  Having to wipe the drool off my keyboard here.  I shared an order of their cheese fries with my friend as well.  Their fries are of the crinkle variety and are in no way soggy or lacking in flavor.  Perfectly salty.  Perfectly crispy.   Mmmmm mmmmm goooooood.  I could lick that cup of cheese sauce clean well after the fries are gone too.   I've already been back for a second trip (only 2 weeks later) and had myself their Italian Beef dipped with hot peppers.  While it was also tasty, I am most definitely a Chicago Dog kind of gal.  This time, I also had their famous chocolate cake.  At first glance, this slice of cake looks like something like that would make the roof of your mouth stick to your tongue.  But it is moist, not too overly sweet, it's perfectly chocolatey, and I didn't even need a glass of milk to go with it.  Apparently, they use mayonnaise in their batter.    I WILL be back for more and I am completely in trouble if a Portillo's makes its way out to the west valley...but I wouldn't be torn up if it did either.",

I couldn't wait for Portillos to open and after lunch today I feel I was duped!!! It wasn't the plentiful and polite staff, or the Disney esque big top meets roadhouse interior, it wasn't what seemed like reasonable prices, or even the hoards of crowds most restaurants only dream of.  Alas it all came down to element number 1, The food. I had a hot dog with everything. This shy dog wasn't too shy with the celery salt, it completely over powered all other flavors. As for the texture of that barker it was so soggy the bun seemed to drip off, and the peppers so tough I had to take them out of my mouth. The pickle on it was far bigger then the frank that just seems like reckless pickling!  My beef sandwich was amongst the worst I have ever had, The meat was dry and mealy, The bread was lame, crunchy on the outside and almost as wet as the dripping hot dog paste bun on the inside. What struck me hardest was the massive dose of SALT!!!! Yikes I even like salt. I couldn't get back in line and wait twenty minutes to try over, so my lunch today hit the trash can!!!!  I may have caught them on a bad day, it was certainly a busy one, but my first try will be my only try. There are better options around town and with less circus!!!",

This is a pretty cheap restaurant that even offers drive-thru.  I had the ceaser salad and grilled tuna burger and ordered through the drive-thru.  I also made some custimizations (sub cheese for tartar sauce on the tuna; salad dressing on side), and they were all perfected.  The Tuna burger was the best drive-thru, non-meat, item I have ever had.  And the salad was very good with an entire egg and tomatoes, items which I really like in a ceasar, even if not traditional.  Overall, if you are looking for drive-thru and want some new, unique options, then this is the best place in Phoenix area as far as I am concerned.",

    "text": "Me and my family of 5 went here for dinner because of the location near the Tempe Marketplace.  I was intrigued by the extensive menu and the reputation of a midwest restaurant chain.  So I ordered the combo beef/char grilled italian dog with peppers.  It tasted nothing special, like something you'd buy at the store and make at home.  I was disappointed there wasn't much more dressing/condiments to choose from.  Peppers or none. Mustard had to be requested and it came from packets so no pump at the napkin/straw station. I did love the soft bread buns they came in though.. My husband ordered the italian sausage and also agreed, nothing special.  My son had the bacon burger and it was greasy but the bun covered the entire patty.  They have crinkle fries and cheese on the side for extra. Ore-Ida probably.  we'd go here again if we were hankering for hot dogs next time.  We think the same of Ted's Hot Dogs down the street, nothing special.  But it could be more special if it were the spices/flavorings. The prices were appropriate and affordable and the ambience is great though. Memorabilia and neon signs and pics of famous people who love the chain. I couldn't believe how busy they were on a Saturday night.  Clean bathrooms for when you're done eating those messy dogs, though!",

    "text": "So I was a little bored one evening and decided to finally try this place months after the hype of grand opening. I figured by now the hour long lines will be long gone and everybody in Maricopa County had tried it at least once by now. So I get to the northeast corner of McClintock and E Rio Salado Parkway and enter a real clusterfork of a parking lot. Since the drive through lane is pretty big and surrounds Portillo's you have to park off to the east where there are signs telling you that you can only go in one direction. There is more parking beyond what you initially see when you first enter the area though. Pretty much all the parking right in front near the entrance are handicapped parking stalls. Fortunately, Portillo's was a late afterthought/addition to this mall so it has its own corner and is pretty much completely separate from the rest of the mall. An island of Chicago in a Tempe mall. If I remember correctly it's more or less the same corner that Nita's Hideaway used to be on many eons ago. So you come in and see multiple areas - one for phone order pickup, and all the way in back a place that you place your order. You then walk halfway across the restaurant after ordering and listen for your number. Everything comes in a thick brown plastic tray with four drink holders. So I ordered a standard fountain drink as well as a Maxwell Street Polish dog, a bowl of chili, and a tamale. Hadn't eaten all day more or less so I was hungry. Luckily it was not very crowded and I found some seating right away. I would hate to have to eat a hotdog in a hallway. So anyway, the hot dog was delicious - especially with the grilled onions sprinkled on top and with a bit of mustard as well. But no ketchup. Which is good because as Dirty Harry once said \"Nobody, I mean NOBODY puts ketchup on a hot dog!\" So that was the best part of the meal. Then I had the chili. Came with cheese and onions. It was alright. I like the chili at Lobby's better though. Truth. Finally - the tamale. It was wrapped in foil and then again in several layers of the kind of paper you wrap food to go in. It was one long greasy gut bomb. Pretty much plain masa and what tasted like the sauce in the chili inside it. Perhaps it's that toddling town's version of a tamale and if I was an ex-pat homesick for the Windy City I might have enjoyed it much more as the nostalgia kicked in. But since I'm NOT from Chitown and have only been once in my life for a couple of days when I was grade school age I was just curious as to what their tamales tasted like. Fortunately curiosity didn't kill the cat but instead gave him about 3 or 4 swift kicks to the stomach and a stern warning. NEVER EAT THOSE AGAIN. All night I felt my stomach churn and I'm sure the tamale was the the cause of it. If you ate 5 or 6 of those you'd be a walking tear gas/pepper spray cannister. So after I was more or less satisfied I walked back out into the night and noticed that the closest store in the rest of the mall to Portillo's just happens to be Lane Bryant. I guess if you become a REALLY big fan of Portillo's that is rather conveniently located. I'm sure I'll be back again one day.",

The presentation (both sloppy goopy messes) was absolutely awful and the taste of the food was even worse.  This was probably the most disgusting meal I've ever had ANYWHERE.  You can get a better chili dog 1/2 mile down the road at Weinerschnitzel (and for 1/3 the price).  The fries were just like the Ore Ida's you buy frozen at the grocery store and bake in an oven.  Limp and tasteless.  You Chicagoans must be easily impressed (or have no taste) if you think this place is good.  One more interesting fact....this is one of the few places that doesn't have a link on your receipt for a review/feedback to the home office about your experience....gee, I wonder why!!",

Like a place you and your buddies go on a Friday or Saturday night before you hit the movies at Tempe Marketplace before your parents pick you up behind the restaurant so no one can see you don't have a car.  I've never been to Chicago so I have to take their word that it is just like what they serve there.  I've also never really been into hot dogs, much less hot dogs on steroids.  My brother-in-law and I went there because he said it was good eats for cheap.  He was right.  The quantity of food you get is good.  They give you these little muffins with your salad that are tasty.  You can also get some pretty mean looking chili cheese dogs if you're brave enough.  I went a little more boring and got a chicken sandwich.  Not the place you want to visit if you're looking to relax.  It's extremely loud in there!  The patio is nice if you decide to sit outside.",

The decor inside instantly makes you feel like you're back in [insert worn out Chicago nickname here].  We got some classic Chicago dogs, an Italian beef with hot peppers & cheese (dipped), some fries, some rings and a piece of cake. The dogs were exactly like I remember and I want more right now just writing about them. I don't know, something about the soft poppy seed bun, beefy dog and that neon green relish along with the crunchy sport peppers just makes me instantly crave them. In hindsight, I should have skipped everything else and left more room for dogs. Maybe the Italian beef was awesome for people who have all the memories/nostalgia that goes with a dish like that, but as I've never had the real thing, it was wasted on me; it was just some soggy bread and bland beef. Again, I feel as though I may be dissing someone's religion here, so forgive my blasphemy - I know not what I ate.",

SHe approached us and asked how our meal was, gave us some suggestions for next time and was just chatting with us. We were sitting over by the shake/cake counter and I told her how I was debating getting a piece of chocolate cake. She told us how she helped make it from scratch that morning and that we had to try it. Convincing me to eat any type of sweet is not hard, so needless to say I ordered a piece. IT WAS UN-REAL! super moist and the frosting was the best I've ever had! Between the service, the food and the employees....we had a great experience. We will for sure be back!",

    "text": "Every time I go to Chicago, I try to hit Portillos at least once. I was so happy they opened some here. Our first visit to the N. Scottsdale store was so-so. The staff was good and the food as expected, but not impressive. The Tempe store just opened a few weeks ago so my son and I decided to go. We should have gone to Smash burger around the corner. First, the place is on the NE corner of McClintock and Rio Salado. It is NOT really attached to Tempe Marketplace unless you park by the Imports store and walk through the breezeway to the restaurant. if you go, do this, because the parking lot is a total disaster. The lanes are too narrow for two cars to pass each other, so when (not if) somebody ignores the arrows and goes the wrong way, everything gridlocks. If you drive a pickup, don't park there, as it takes a 50 point turn to back out of the narrow spaces. After parking my truck in a spot more sized for for a smart, we walked all the way around the drive thru (which should have been on the other side of the store) and through the patio with too many tables to the line at the cash register. They have two lines, and a nice big easy to read menu on the wall. the problem is, there is a lady standing there that hands you a menu in size 4 font and expects you to figure out what you want before going to the register and while she is suggesting stuff to eat. I was told \" Please step aside while you make your selection, as the lines grow pretty fast. I don't want you to feel rushed.\" Really. At that point I felt rushed, told her so, and after looking behind me to see NOBODY in line but us, I walked up to the register, ordered something quickly without looking at the whole menu, and then stood in the throng of people at the pickup counter waiting for their numbers to be called, because you CAN NOT hear them in the dining room area. I guess they don't want you to get a table until your hands are full of trays of food. I can understand not taking a table while your family waits in line, but once you order, it's fair game. The Chicago Dog was bang-on perfect, the burger, was sort of bland. I'll go back, but only for lunch, and not for a dog or a burger, Teds Hotdogs beats Portillos, and Smashburger and Burger Rehab are the only place to go for a burger in this town. If you're gonna enter a new market, be sure you bring what makes you good at home.",

    "text": "Portillo's in Tempe is close to home and my son and I enjoyed watching it built..  Though we spent a couple of years in Chicago, we had never been to Portillo's, so we didn't know what to expect.  We loved it.   I'm surprised at the number of critical reviews since the place has been full of very happy people the two times we've visited.  We've had the beef sandwich with hot peppers, the Maxwell St. Polish, a burger, a hot dog, fries, onion rings, and a cake shake.  I thought the beef sandwich was outstanding and its grilled onions thick and succulent.  The Maxwell St. Polish was huge and perfectly grilled. Son loved the burger and the dog and refused to share the cake shake.  I'm determined to try much of the rest of the menu but it will be hard on future visits to pass up the beef or the Maxwell St. Polish. The beef sandwich comes with just the amount of gravy you prefer, from \"dry\" through \"dipped\".  The gravy is delicious and the bread soaks it up nicely.  It's similar to the old standby menu item \"roast beef sandwich au jus\",  or \"French dip\"  except the beef is more generous and flavorful.  If you are put off by a sandwich roll moist with gravy, order it \"dry\", but you'll be missing out on some of the goodness.  Peppers and mozzarella add even more joy.    It's well organized, well-staffed and efficient, with very friendly employees, and it's amazing to be able to say that during its opening days since the crowds have been impressive.  On both our visits, the officers who directed us to parking spaces were very helpful.  If someone had described Portillo's to me initially as \" large, crowded and loud\" , I might have hesitated as I'm long past college age and also appreciate fine dining, but I found the atmosphere to be a lot of fun.  I enjoyed the woman at the pick-up counter who rhymed the orders she called.  A room full of happy people enjoying good food creates an infectious atmosphere. As we made our way outside and walked past the outside tables, we saw a lot of contented smiles.  If I could change anything, I'd wish for hand-cut, home-made fries.  My son and I decided we will return regularly and check out the rest of the menu.",

We always forget and go back! Tonight they forgot part of the paid for order and didn't give me time to order extra sauce.  On TOP of all that- sitting at the drive through window, I watched an employee take a bite of cake with her bare hands- rinse them off with no soap and then go bag my food! GROSS!!!  It's not that good of food! I'll find a different place for hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches.

Lowell, literally the best Italian beef and hot dogs and grinders I've ever had, without having ever been to Chicago.   So my dad tells me he had been to Portillo's in Chicago and that Luke's copied Portillo's. Says we should totally go, and so I'm expecting this AMAZING food.   We eat out a lot, and usually when we aren't impressed then we just shrug it off, but I was pretty disappointed here. We all were. The \"big beef\" was decent sized, but as bland as bland could be. Bland and dry. I also got a \"southwest bbq chicken salad\" and it looked like something from QuikTrip. And you know, I honestly think the salads at QT are better than that. It was supposed to come with BBQ ranch, but.... It just tasted like sweet watery mayonnaise in there. Oh man.... So disappointed. My daughter got the fried chicken croissant sandwich, which tasted OK, but was nothing to write home about. Standard fried chicken item, standard fried chicken taste. I sure hope the original Portillo's is better than this.",

    "text": "They don't deserve a one-star review, but they sure tried to earn one.  We showed up on a Friday night.  The place was relatively busy.  My first inclination of a poo-show was that they asked for two lines to form, then they funneled us to three open registers.  The result is that the people in the other line, who'd arrived after us, with about 7 people in their party, decided to walk up to the register when it was our turn.  No big deal, but it's a crappy way to introduce the guests to the place.  It was SUPER loud and the cashier, who seemed as though she felt she was too good to be there, made no attempt to speak loud enough so we had to ask her to repeat herself constantly.  We got ready to receive our food and here's where a poor experience turned worse...they completely messed up our order.  They gave me a bag with some kind of wrapped item, and french fries and a small coke.  Which is odd, because we ordered a double-bacon burger and the grilled tuna sandwich with onion rings and a lemonade.  I pointed out the error and they started over.  We finally got our order - the onion rings were way over cooked, and the fish sandwich tasted like cat food (don't ask me how I know; just...college).  The burger was dry and surprisingly devoid of flavor.  Oh, and no bacon.  When I pointed it out they just gave me a few pieces of bacon...cold.  It must have been from a Kevlar pig because it was virtually impossible to bite through it.  I love food and one of my favorite things to eat is hamburgers.  I didn't finish it.  I figured that the taste wasn't worth the calories.  The only reason they didn't get one-star is because they played some decent music.  Plus, I want to save my one-star reviews for places that suck like black-holes.  To the people that say their food is good: please get out more.",

It was very busy and they could anticipate someone ordering this item and have some cooking and ready. There about 20 orders with numbers after mine they came up while I waited for about ten minutes after ordering just two dogs and the rings. Second when I finally got the rings it was an order with only six rings and one was prepared with the chewy hard edge piece of the onion. Not edible at all. When I went back up and told the crew member that it was bad the first thing out of his mouth was, \"Is it just the one?\" I told him that one ring was 17% of the order. He offered to cook me another order. I told him I did not want to wait for them and some fries would be okay. He gave me an order if fries but looked annoyed that he had to give me anything.  The hot dogs were great but the service and attitude of that crew member killed this visit for me.",

This one was the second best beef dip (italian dip or french dip = it's just a name right?) that I've ever had. yum yum yum  It could have been more perfect if a slice of provolone was melted on top but the quality is certainly there. I also tried the hot dog and it was excellent too. The bun was seeded and perfect. It was too much bread which I like.  The dog was the kind that snaps.  Also had a vanilla malt which was excellent.  So a beef dip, hot dog and a malt was $12 - now that's a deal!   I enjoyed lunch so much that I went back the next day for a repeat performance and am a very happy camper.

    "text": "What a mixed bag. I'll start with the Pros  The grilled Italian sandwich had a great taste and If I ever went back. That's what I'd get.  The greek side salad was ok. But way to many onions. That's just a personal preference.   They had a wide variety of foods on the menu for a drive thru restaurant  - ribs, pasta, Burgers, hot dogs etc.  I'm not sure if they make their own bread but it is really good.  The cons  Parking Lot- Complete total nightmare. How many accidents happen here?  Went for Lunch on a Saturday. It was so packed. Like getting in/out of a concert. If we weren't meeting family there we would have skipped it completely. The line to get to the counter to order had no less than 50 people. Out the Door.  I decided to to try and get a table for 7 in the madness. I lucked out and pushed two tables together. IMMEDIATELY  a staff was there asking me \"How many people are in your party???\" I was confused by that for a second because you seat yourself here and it is such a circus I could hardly hear her. \"Seven\" I said. She just walked off. I guess she cared that we were using to 4 seat tables.  Turns out it was faster for me to add the Portillos app on my Phone and place an order for pick up then it was to stand in line. I know this because my husband stood with his family and our food was done first. By at least 10 mins. FYI there is a separate counter for pick ups.  When I brought the food back to the table and passed it out they had forgot some of my order. I went back up and they got the forgotten food and asked it I would like a piece of cake. I thought that was really nice .  My husband did not like his hamburger. Didn't like the taste of the meat.  I did like the portobello sandwich. But on the app when it asks if you want to customize it, taking off onions or lettuce is not an option.  FYI- You have to take your drink to the counter to get refills.  We felt it was pricey for what you get. We won't go back, seriously not worth the hassle. There wasn't one thing we tried that stood out so much that we would fight the crowds to go get again.  Plus we don't live near it. But if we did, would I try the drive thru one time? Maybe for a sandwich, no sides.  I think this is a place you go if you ate here when you lived in Chicago otherwise....We wouldn't recommend it on a weekend anyways.",

    "text": "The valley has always acted as a sort of refuge for long lost Chicago expats looking to escape the harsh Lake Michigan winters.  And increasingly, much of Chicago's food culture has come to the valley with them.  Of late, the Chicago deep dish pizza craze has migrated to the valley with Chicago staples like Lou Malnati's, Gino's East, and Giordano's adding new locations in the Phoenix area.  But just before that recent wave of food migration, it was a Chicago hot dog staple that made its way to the Phoenix area.   Portillo's has been a Chicago institution for more than half a century.  Founder Dick Portillo opened his first hot dog stand in 1963 and there are now more than 40 Portillo's locations in 7 states.  On a Sunday evening after watching football, I ventured to Portillo's Tempe location for my first taste of this midwestern icon.  You can find Portillo's Tempe on the northeast corner of McClintock & Rio Salado.  Truth be told I really had no idea what I'd expected to see.  I had in my head a vision of a small hot dog stand or at most a standard 50 seat fast food joint setup dishing out food at lighting speed.  In reality, Portillo's is far more complex, as evidenced by the sheer monstrosity of their Tempe location.  Brightly lit from the outside, this is anything but a humble hot dog stand.  We're talking a restaurant with seating for upwards of 300 and a drive thru to match.  I'd heard from other Portillo's fans about long lines and a cult like following not dissimilar to the experience of California based In-N-Out Burger restaurants.  That's a fairly apt description, though I would probably more accurately describe my experience at Portillo's Tempe as something more closely resembling a mix of In-N-Out Burger nostalgia and enthusiasm with the casual family friendly atmosphere of a Fuddruckers.  Anyways, enough symbolism and imagery.  Let's get to dinner.  While Portillo's menu has expanded over the years to include a number of offerings including burgers and chicken dishes, I (mostly) stuck with the Portillo's standards during my first go around.  The first dish of choice of course would have to be the Portillo's rendition of the traditional Chicago hot dog.  And in Chicago they're serious when they say their hot dogs get \"dragged through the garden\".  We're talking an all beef hot dog with mustard, neon green relish, chopped onions, tomato slices, half a kosher dill pickle, peppers and celery salt piled high on a steamed poppy seed hot dog bun.  I also got a side of Portillo's favorite cheese fries.  And lastly, I combined a beverage with dessert by ordering their chocolate cake shake.  Portillo's is famous for their homemade chocolate cake and apparently people love their shakes, so voila.  Coming here at dinner you wait in line to place your order (which on Sunday at 6pm was about a 15 minute wait) and then you walk over to the pick up area and wait for your number to get called (which took another 15 minutes).  Total cost for the food, drink and tax came to just under $10.  Was it all worth the wait?  I grabbed a table in the corner inside to enjoy my meal and people watch.  I've actually never had a True Chicago-style hot dog (though I've had many other hot dog renditions in my time).  The hot dog was good, though all the toppings are a little overwhelming.  The mesh of textures from all the veggies and fixins creates a decent variety of flavors, but I finished it feeling like I kind of missed out on the hot dog flavor itself.  Perhaps next time I should get the Jumbo dog to strike that perfect balance.  The cheese fries were, well, underwhelming.  Its just crinkle fries and nacho cheese sauce basically.  It was fine, but honestly the sales pitch for this side dish sounded far more glamorous in my mind.  Lastly, the shake.  I'm mostly a fan of this shake.  Its quite literally liquid cake, but the cake is quite tasty and on the sweet side even for chocolate cake.  So thusfar I'm not really bought into the hype about this place, but I suppose our Chicago expat population is at least partly what is driving Portillo's success in the valley.  I'll admit the prices here are more than fair and the atmosphere of their restaurant is super family friendly so I can understand the suburban appeal of this hot dog stand.  But with all the hot dog establishments big and small throughout the valley, I can't say Portillo's ranks amongst my top favorites (at least not yet).  I'm not opposed to popular establishments from far flung regions trying their hand at the valley culinary scene, provided they deliver a great product at a great value.  Portillo's is good, but for now far from great.",

    "text": "A Letter to Portillo's About Our Latest Experiences:  We went to Portillo's today, and in this particular instance, the chocolate cake was missing from our order. However, the reason I am taking the time to write this is because my boyfriend has been coming here since you opened without any problems, but lately there have been issues every other time. During one visit, instead of chocolate cake, they gave us a baked potato. Another time recently, they forgot our hot peppers on our Italian Beef. The time before that, they forgot to give us our Italian Beef, and luckily caught us in the parking lot driving away. Portillo's is our favorite restaurant, however we have an extreme lack of confidence in order accuracy lately. At one point in time, it seemed as if one of the staff members was purposefully messing with the orders and being somewhat rude. It felt as if every time we saw this person, our order was messed up. Conspiracy Therory or not, it's weird that four years of perfect accuracy for my boyfriend was suddenly exchanged for nonstop inconsistencies with us. As mentioned, this is our favorite food place in the world and we go here way more than we'd like to admit. We love your food so much that it's heartbreaking to be void of an item. Your chocolate cake (when my wallet allows me to experience it) is life changing!   Sincerely, The Willis  ***Update*** After submitting this letter to Portillos's online, we were contacted and sent coupons. I'm very happy with the way that Portillo's addressed these issues, as they gave us three gift cards for a free sandwich, side, and drink. We had three issues, and they've given us three free meals in return. I'm extremely satisfied with the resolution of this situation! Portillo's has our loyalty now and forever!",

And for the price she paid, her portions were quite small.   I will probably never go back to this place. They aren't bad, but in AZ we have WAY better choices for this type of food.

    "text": "I'm finding it hard to write a review about this Portillo's right now.  I come here a lot and I enjoy their food.  But they are making it hard to enjoy the experience lately.  I work at a local office and it is now impossible to send one person to place orders for all of us because Portillo's will not let you do more than one transaction or put your office mate's order on their credit/debit card.  You can't even do more than one order if you're paying for a 2nd order in cash anymore. I don't understand this at all.  So if everyone in our office wanted Portillo's for lunch, every single one of us would have to leave work and go there to place an order or else one person would have to pay for everyone's order.  In addition to this, today I was going to place an order for a salad so I asked where they are sourcing their romaine from given the current romaine situation.  My answer was an exasperated sigh followed by \"I don't know but it's not from Yuma.\"  Clearly they are getting the question frequently, which is completely understandable, but I don't understand why their staff is not equipped to answer this question.  Where I work there is a cafe and romaine is served and every member of my staff can tell you where our romaine is coming from right now.  And they don't get upset when a customer asks.  I don't know why this particular Portillo's has become less customer friendly over the last few months but I do hope this doesn't continue to be a trend as I do genuinely enjoy their food.  I also hope they find a new supplier for romaine soon because the lettuce on today's salad was in really bad shape.",

If you're going to open two lines to the cash registers, then it needs to be regulated so that everyone gets served equally. I ended up leaving because I was so mad.

I felt as if I were stepping back to a simpler time of good food and good people.   Let's talk about the food. I ordered the Big Beef sandwich, large (crinkle cut) fries, and a large lemonade. This Italian Beef sandwich is one of the top 10 things I have eaten in my life.....seriously. The beef is cooked to perfection, the peppers (I ordered both hot and sweet) were the perfect accent, and the bread, which soaks up the gravy that is poured on the sandwich provides a great texture to wrap everything together. The fries are absolute perfection as well. They were the perfect temp and crunchiness.   This has instantly become one of my go to spots. If you have one near you, or even if it is a bit of a drive (it's 45 minutes for me), it is worth it!   This is not a meal I will soon forget.",

    "text": "Ive always heard people from Chicago mention this place. They seem to swoon with joy as they reminisce over Italian Beef and Hot dogs from here. I didn't visit this establishment in Chicago because I didn't feel it was going to be worth my time. Jump forward from time and into the present and Im eating Portillo's in Phoenix. I was quite shocked to find they branched out of Illinois, but then again, fast food can go wherever it pleases.     Let me say that I have seen the amount of widly different reviews for this place. Some bed-wetters were complaining about things that dont even involve the food (such as parking and how the food is wrapped). Some people, based on their pictures, were served some god awful food (the sloppy dogs and burnt ribs were cringe worthy). Im not going to defend an establishment that may not do everything right, but my review only stands for what I had on the day I had it. Otherwise, look closely at what people order or dont order.   Walking in, I felt like I was this hybrid of modern times meets 1950's Chicago. I almost thought it was realized that was just a setup. It was quite busy and they had a ton of workers buzzing around with all the orders written on the back of the bags. I figured I would go for the Italian Beef and Sausage combo, since several people mentioned it. I got hot peppers and onions with mine, as well as extra gravy (the dipped sandwich idea sounds like soggy bread to me). In some hope of not completely destroying my body, I also ordered a fruit cup that I picked up from a completely different location of the building. I may not understand their system, but it appears to work for them.    The sandwich was much better than I thought it was gonna be. I knew this place was upscale fast food, but I see now how Chicago natives could get excited over a place like this. The sausage was huge, packed with a meaty, juicy punch in every bite. The italian beef was also moist, although I thought the sausage stood out a little more in flavor. The \"gravy\" only kept the meat taste continuous in the high notes. The veggies had a good burn without feeling overwhelming. The bread is something Im still trying to decipher. Its firm when served without any gravy, but because of the gravy and juices, it gets soft, but not unbearably soggy. I have a feeling this is the style that this bread was made for, but Im so use to having firm bread. This is more of a note on my personal preference, but its worth mentioning. Their fruit cups are a solid choice (they at least appear and feel fresh).    I was quite pleased with my sandwich here. Its definitely simple in its approach, but satisfies the craving for a meat sandwich. I hope that whoever visits here visits on a good day.",

The hot dog and burgers too are a family favorite. Definitely get a delicious peice of chocolate cake! The best I've ever had! French fries are hard and crispy with a soft center too. Only improvement they can make is to get their employees motivated. So slow here in Az. In Chicago you NEVER wait longer then 10 mins for food. Here is a lo ger wait. But I definitely itly will wait for it...",

The other day I decided to go inside instead of running through the drive through and I paid a little more attention to the menu and realized I was ordering the sandwich wrong. After realizing my mistake I ordered it the proper way (dipped) and it was leaps and bounds better than getting it dry. Totally my fault and now I'm writing a review to help direct people here. Also tried the onion rings for the first time and they were excellent. The cake shakes are a bit heavy so I suggest getting a small unless you're sharing it, but they're pretty damn good as well. Definitely will be hitting them up more frequently.",

Waited in line 1/2 hour to order, 20 min to get food and then both of our orders were wrong. The Italian beef sandwiches were very dry, forgot our cheese and gave us the wrong drinks. I ordered iced tea, stirred sweetener in it and it exploded all over the table. They have given me root beer by mistake. Tables were left unclean and littered with gooey trash even thought it was so busy that they needed tables turned fast. Clearly overwhelmed (it was a weekend around 2 PM).   Went back today at a less busy time(11 am weekday) and got there just before the noon rush. No line and got food very quickly. A kind staff member even asked a worker to help with a highchair for little dude. I ordered beef and cheddar with extra gravy this time and cheese fries. The sandwich was still dry but cheese fries awesome. By the time I was ready for a drink refill, the line was enormous and you have to ask staff for a refill. My friend really enjoyed her Chicago dog but did not care for her onion rings. She said they were oily and flavorless.  Trip two was a bit better but still not overly impressed with this location. Thumbs up on cheese fries and Chicago dog but not worth the trip here from East Mesa.",

I ask for the receipt of the correct order cause it said $15 on the receipt with all these extra charges and she brings me back what is supposed to be the correct receipt (which was still wrong and they overcharged me) and .75 cents as if that's supposed to fix the fact they over charged me. I couldn't even talk to these people any more cause they didn't understand customer service or more simply their job.

But recently I ordered a burger, trying to explore the menu a little bit. It was one of the best I've had in memory. Classic American style, with fresh toppings and good seasoning. Generous size, tasty bun - and an outstanding value at just over 5 bucks. There are other restaurants out there, but this price cannot be best for the quality.",

After having to back up, back other cars up and go around we didn't even get a sorry. Then we asked why she did that she shrugged and said my husband slapped it out of her hand. I told her i was right there and saw her talking to her friend instead of paying attention. She rolled her eyes, closed the window and started talking about us to her coworkers. Awesome. We probably got 2 spit sandwiches after that. We asked to speak to a manager and got Tom. Got a half assed apology basically saying sorry if u got ur feelings hurt. We tossed the sandwiches and went somewhere else. Didn't trust they weren't messed with given their complete lack of professionalism. We will never be back.",

Italian sausage is perfect, with the right amount of spice.  Service is great. Everyone is Friendly and helpful.  They flew out Chicago people to get this place going right!

    "text": "Food is ok, like higher end fast food. Loud obnoxious zoo-like atmosphere. It's not hard to find better food, portions, prices and especially atmosphere throughout Tempe. Maybe I'll try the drive-thru, but I doubt I'll walk through the doors again.   The serving dining experience was repulsive. I couldn't wait to get my food and leave. That might be intentional. You walk in the door and a guy tells you to walk along 'that direction' among the people lined up like cattle, then turn left and form two lines to order. Push push push, give us your order, then a girl on a microphone is yelling at the dozens of waiting hordes hoping their number gets called... \"Number 190, Number 190. Please people, all of you people waiting, please cram more closely together, but don't sit down if you don't have your food. Number 214, Number 217.\" It's loud, obnoxious, and stressful. And you don't escape that when you finally get your food. Reminds me of a mall food court or a state fair. It's cafeteria style with loud annoying amplified barkers, fast food environment, and a-little-better-than fast food food.  I couldn't wait to scarf down my food and get out of there! And I can't imagine drudging through the suffocating inconvenience (of parking alone) for that again.  The food itself was fine. I might even have thought it above average if it was from a drive-thru (they do have one). But the chicken sandwich croissant and fries I tried wasn't anything you can't beat throughout Tempe without the cattle barn atmosphere.  There was a huge staff, all doing their jobs diligently. If you call that service, it was fine. But If service has anything to do with customer comfort, convenience, providing a good experience and a reason to return, I would rate it very poor.   It's not fair to trash everything and everyone that is Chicago. It's a great city with a rich culture, great people, and a lot of great food. This particular place just doesn't seem to have much that Arizona needs.",

They had employees taking orders in the line for the drive thru but they didn't have menus handy for us to look at and the actual menu was still a ways up. We finally get to see a menu and we place our order. I ordered the chicken crossiant sandwich with cheese. Normally its a breast, but when I placed my order, they failed to tell me they were out of chicken breast and had put in a fried piece of chicken in its place. If they had just informed me they were out of chicken breast as the time of ordering, I would have ordered something else, but they didnt tell me until it was too late to change the order. They also forgot to add the cheese to my sandwich and the bun was not a crossiant, but a regular bun. Someone royally screwed my order up. We also ordered sides of ranch when we placed our order. When we got our food and checked for the ranch, there wasnt any, so we had to hold up the long line to ask for ranch. When handed the ranch, we were rudely informed normally they charger extra for ranch. I went on to inform her we were well aware of the extra charges and were more than happy to pay them, which is why we included it in our order, which they failed to add to our bill. I was not happy with the customer service nor their lack of communication and lack of getting the correct order. I will never go there when it is really busy again.",

When we first got there the parking lot was packed, which usually happens when something new opens up. People love to be trendy and hip, why going to a new fast food place is that I don't know. I ordered the bacon burger, fries, and a chocolate malt My friend had the Italian beef (claims to be Chicago #1). Had to wait in a huddled group of people all carefully listening for the number to be called. you could hear after every time the girl said a number everyone asking what did she say? The Burger tasted fine, just like you would get any where else. For $10 meal I felt ripped off. When I took the top bun off and looked at it. the first thing that came to my mind was an old lady saying wheres the beef! The patty was so small. The fries where okay, the malt tasted like powder. My friends meal was bland and tasteless, he had to pull the peppers out and throw them away as they where tough and chewy. If this is the number one restaurant in Chicago then I know the reason the all move here now, to get away from this crap.  If you want a good fast Chicago restaurant go to Luke's on Indian school in Phoenix, you won't be disappointed.",

I ended up trying the Italian beef with hot peppers. Overall it was good, the meat didn't seem to have much flavor though. We split an order of fries with cheese sauce. We assumed cheese would be poured over the fries, but we got cheese in a dipping plastic container. The fries were decent but the cheese had almost no flavor either. Everything is \"a la carte\".",

The following will be borrowed from a previous location that I have reviewed. It will be several of my favorite foods from the menu. Enjoy!   Roast Beef Sandwich. One of the best roast beefs in town. I would recommend getting it with mozzarella cheese, hot peppers, double dipped in gravy. It's a fantastic meal! For those with a serious appetite, try ordering the Big Beef. It's twice the sandwich for only a little more.   Jumbo Hotdog with everything on it. A Jumbo all beef hotdog with onion, relish, tomato, hot peppers, mustard, and a speared pickle. This is the epitome of the Chicago Hotdog! A must try! I recommend ordering two.  Fresh Chopped Salad. Ditalini pasta, crumbled bacon, romaine and iceberg lettuce, red cabbage, tomatoes, onion, gorgonzola cheese, chopped chicken, with a great blend of spices.  Now a few things that I would stay clear of... The Cake Shake and the Malts. The Cake Shake take a piece of their famous chocolate cake and blends it with a chocolate shake. It is WAY too much chocolate for a desert. I would only order this if you have a serious sweet tooth. As for the Malts, they are seriously lacking with the malt power and you can get a better Malt elsewhere in town.",

It was Saturday morning, which in my house screams errands, yard work, etc. I headed out the door to get the tires on the Landy Balanced & Rotated at the Goodyear service center on McClintock & Rio Salado. Upon my arrival at the service center I was faced with two options, nether of which sounded fantastical. Sit in the waiting room or walk across the street to tempe marketplace that had not yet opened, and browse the closed stores through the windows. I opted to get my walk on, and as I headed across the street I noticed that there were people at portillo's lining up, and it only being 10am (a few being the channel 3 news guys parked in the news truck) it was then that I decided to give this place a try,after hearing a ton of good & bad about the establishment that was  Chicago favorites.   When you walk in you are greeted by many friendly faces, hellos, and a really cool looking interior that reminded me of a 50's diner in some way, yet mixed with some modern touches.   Now to the food:  I had the Italian beef sandwich, that consisted of warm fresh italian bread with slow cooked italian beef piled on high with a ladle of Au Jus over the top. I added hot peppers and mozzarella cheese to my sammy. For my side I chose french fries and ordered a side of the nacho cheese to dip them in.  The fries were fresh, hot and ready for some cheese, which came in a small cup that was more than I could ever imagine to finish, but that did not stop me from trying.   Bottom line: The food was awesome, and the hot peppers had just enough bite as to not take away from the bread, meat, and cheese that had been piled on. The fries complimented the sandwich perfectly, and had I not ordered them I may have still been a little hungry, as the sandwich I ordered was on the small size. Given the fact the entire meal was around $8.00, I cannot complain.   I will certainly be back to try more of the Chicago favorites Portillo's is serving up.",

When they opened in Scottsdale I was more than willing to wait one hour in the drive thru line to get my fix.  Tonight on the way home from Chandler I was advised that we would be going to Portillo's as my partner had a craving for their food. Don't have to twist my arm, any day with Portillo's for lunch or dinner is a GREAT DAY!  Tonight we both opted for hot dogs and fries. The order came out quick and it was right. I've rarely had an order come out wrong and if it was they fixed it right away.  If you're coming here the things to try include: Hot Dogs (with everything) Fries Italian Beef with Sweet Peppers - Dipped! Chopped Salad - if it's To Go ask them to \"Toss It\" otherwise the dressing is on the side Chocolate Cake Shake - only once in a while...they are addicting! These are my favorites",

I did enjoy how they call out orders in rhyme and the look of the place.   On my second visit, I tried out their big beef sandwich I saw advertised all over the building and my wife ordered one of their famous dogs. First of all, the lady taking our order had poor customer service skills. I simply asked if it came with or if I could order sweet onion sauce or any kind of sauce that would go well with my beef sandwich. She looked at me as if I was crazy for asking before telling me no such thing exists there. The sandwich itself was large but lacked any sort of real flavor, and the bun was soggy and dripping all over. My wife was equally disappointed in her hot dog, saying that it was smaller and not even as tastey as the $1 hot dogs at the local QT.   Needless to say, neither of us are in any hurry to return.",

I picked up my usual when I go there as it is 2 Maxwell's, 2 Italian beef and cheeseburger. And before you say it no it was not all for me. The beef was overcooked, the burger was dry even with condiments and the Maxwells where to start. They were burnt beyond recognition thought it was a piece of charcoal on the roll. I could not even eat it as it was so bad. I know that you could have a bad night but the people putting these together could have seen that these were not edible. I was really disappointed as I live about 35 miles away and did not check them until I was home as I did not think I would need too as many times as I have had great service there. I was just about ready to drive back there when I decided to post this. One bad service can almost make someone never return again and I may not unless I receive my money back on this poor excuse of a meal. loaded pic check it out..lol",
