The decor is definitely outdated and the clientele is family oriented and a lil loud as there's lots of laughter.  I'd definitely recommend if you are going ins big casual group, but not for a date.  The chef himself was very sociable and stopped by every table which was an excellent touch.  We had the lobster and the risotto.  I'd take the risotto over the lobster but at the end of the day it was good!  I'd come back for sure.",

Decor is a little weird but the food and service more than made up for it! Thank you, unknown waiter it was a great dinner,though I was flying solo!

The Shrimp Cocktail was large, cold and fresh. The steak that my brother in law had was very large and cooked properly. I had the pasta trio. The gnocchi was good. The other two pastas were below average and I suspect made from a canned pasta sauce. There were 5 of us dining. Some were happy with the experience. Others simply tolerated it. We dined for a special occasion, Father's Day. Avanti had been on our list of \"To-Try\" restaurants. Been there. Done that. Won't do it again. Once you've seen one pink-walled, Zebra coated restaurant, you've seen 'em all. This place is past it's prime.",

I travel to Phoenix several times a year, and stay at a hotel in the vicinity.  After several perfect visits to Avanti, I needed to make sure the world understands what is going on here.  It is simply sublime.  Be prepared; the decor is a total throw-back.  I expected to see The Rat Pack belly up to the bar for a cocktail.  This is seriously old school, and to me, extremely comforting.  The staff is top-notch.  They give the impression of folks who have worked there for a while and care about the restaurant and the impression they make on the customer. The food incredible.  My favorite thing on the menu is the Pappardelle with Beef Shank Ragu (why is it so hard to find Pappardelle anywhere??)  Trust me, you will not be disappointed!",

When we arrived, they didn't have our table ready, so we had to wait for a couple minutes. They tried to put us at a table for 4 people, when we had a party of 5 so after convincing them we wanted a bigger table, they set it up for us.   We had to flag people down for menus, bread and waters. Our waiter was nice, but not very talkative. When we asked if they had a particular item, such as Eggplant Parmesan, he simply said yes we have everything.   Based on the waiters recommendation, I ordered the pasta trio. It was delicious. Gnocchi, spinach ravioli and penne pasta in a light pink sauce. All vegetarian. I highly recommend it. I also sampled my sister's dish which was mushroom risotto and that was equally as delicious.   We got a bunch of desserts to share: tiramasu, cheesecake, chocolate cake and creme brulee. The best dessert was by far the chocolate cake! Heavenly!   The owner swung by our table twice and was super friendly.   I definitely recommend Avanti's, but be ready to spend a lot of time there and don't be turned off by the mob/italian scene, 80's decorations and non-talkative waiters. We used a coupon from Dine4Az and saved almost 30 dollars. Made up for the service!",

The ambiance alone seriously piqued my curiosity, and I was excited to check it out. People talk about this place. As in, \"Yeah, I'm going to Avanti.\"    \"Oooh, Restaurant of Distinction!!\"  It's like that. And I was NOT disappointed. Probably the most comfortable booth I've ever sat in. Strangely perfect for dining and staying comfortable at the same time.   Even the bathroom was cool. They have little velcro covers for the the pipes under the sink. Talk about class.

A special menu was available for the day and the restaurant was nicely decorated with roses and balloons while a pianist played in the corner. My fiance and I started with the pasta trio and a bottle of Riesling while snacking on the buttered garlic bread. The wait staff gives you ample time to order and is willing to answer any questions along the way. Our entrees included tortellini with walnuts and chicken parmigiana- both of which were amazing. We ended our meal with creme brule which was the only downfall to the meal. It was obvious the kitchen was getting busier and half of our custard wasn't topped with sugar and melted and the other half seemed to be burned leaving a horrible taste in our mouth. The parking is very spotty so try and come early or have a later reservation once it dies down. Definitely recommend this place for authentic Italian!",

I don't know how else you would find this place.   In any case, parking is plentiful. You walk into a \"mid 50-60\" decor with red walls and dim lighting. Servers are dressed in suits. White table cloth, complete table setting, sexy in its own way.  Short menu (that is a plus) Short wine list (another plus) and a good selection of wines by the glass.   The food wash acceptable. The osso bucco was tasty but could have been done a tinge more. I like it when the marrow is like a gel...  Truthfully, went there for the gnocchi which was okay.there were several sauces you could choose from to lather the gnocchi. I chose a cream sauce... Sauce was too thick for my liking, which IMHO took away from the texture of the gnocchi itself.  I would go back though...atmosphere nice, servers nice...  Repeat performance do-able",

Mirrored ceilings, velvet upholstered chairs, cheetah print fabric -- it was like I was in the 80's or in the movie \"Scarface.\"  The place was pretty quiet and the atmosphere would be good for maybe a birthday or a graduation dinner.   I came here with some clients for dinner (on a weeknight) while we were in Phoenix.  There were 2 or 3 other tables here that night; not very busy.     The menu had a good selection of various Italian dishes: pastas, seafood, chicken, veal, pork, etc.   For starters, we all shared the Calamari (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#KrxhHm5bvPqPTmXfpO2rjA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/avan...</a>) and the Escargot De Bourhohne (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#_lPAyaWEzQ9QK92_i6trfA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/avan...</a>).  The Calamari was delicious!  The batter was light and crisp, and the squid was pretty tender.  The Escargot was cooked in garlic butter and brandy wine, which gave it some nice flavors.  It was a little chewy, but it pretty much tasted like a clam.   We all shared a bottle of the 2010 Markham Merlot (Napa Valley) -- this had a nutty, vanilla, woodsy flavor.  We all ordered seafood so it paired nicely with our dishes.  (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#ofGN_r7-hk5EeZkx8W0h1g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/avan...</a>)  For my main dish, I went with one of the specials offered that night, the Squid Ink Ciopinno (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#RCrj3Z_O7IyIUIVA6r5bTg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/avan...</a>).  This seemed more like a pasta rather than a ciopinno in my opinion.  What I love the most about ciopinno is that savory, rich, seafood broth.  This one didn't have any broth, it was more like a tomato sauce.  Although this dish did include a generous amount of seafood (mussels, shrimp, scallop), it didn't taste very fresh and had a rubbery texture.   A few people at my table ordered the Dover Sole special that was available that night  (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#9eQoEjUq1Ayiw6iKw4H5dg_\">yelp.com/biz_photos/avan...</a>.  This fish was fried whole, and then your server removes the fillet from the head/tail right before he served you.  Someone else ordered the Dover Sole dish that was available on the dinner menu (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#RFHGeb_vykwNYJeIQv_fDA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/avan...</a>).  She did not seem to enjoy this very much.  I had a taste of it and it had a murky/mushy taste and texture to it.  The sauce was very buttery-- I prefer the fried Dover over this one.  Dessert was okayyy.  I ordered the Spumoni  (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#RlDB83kUQaeOOU-6EItG8A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/avan...</a>).  It looks like a vanilla turd, lol.  The texture of the ice cream tasted like those ice cream cups you'd get in elementary school-- icee, not creamy, and dirzzled with some Hershey's chocolate syrup.. what a disappointment.  The sorbet was a lot better than the Spumoni and was a refreshing palate cleanser (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#3go2OFhMl_zK2GETMSYJjg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/avan...</a>).  The Tiramisu (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-phoenix?select=ZZCRKeBcrFxbb4fZyaKsWw#pOWH0I8A7J4-UFByf4FR_A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/avan...</a>) was average.. not great and not bad.   In my opinion, the prices here are super steep, especially for most of the dishes we orderded.  Service-wise, we were welcomed upon entrance and our server was very attentive... but only in the beginning of the meal.  It took us forever to get our check.",

Walk in and you will be greeted by an eccentric person in a leisure suit, you can either go in the glass doors with acrylic handles or in to the mirrored room with zebra booth and old conference table chairs. No this is not a gentlemen's club it is a a restaurant that just lacks windows.   For Mother's day they had a buffet only setup, and what mom does not love cold food that has been sitting out for an undetermined  amount of time. The croutons in the Cesar salad were soggy as were the crustinni under the bruchetta. The pasta was cool. Even worse the butter soaked farm raised salmon cubes were just luke warm. The vegetables were mush and again just luke warm. The mozzarella in the caprese on the buffet was not made in house as it was firm and flavorless.   The real amusing part was on the dessert section. There was a plate of items straight from Costco, lemon bites, cookies and cinnamon twists just as you would by at Costo, on a plate and picked over.    This is one relic that is better left in the past, horribly dated decor, sub par food at high prices means this place should be avoided.",

    "text": "Based on a recommendation from a friend, we've dined here a few times.  This Italian joint reminds me of the Peppermill Restaurant in Vegas.  The dining room walls are covered in mirrors and the furniture is black and white.  It's dimly lit and has an intimate feel to it.  During our visits, we've had the following menu items:  Escargots, $11.50  Mozzarella Caprese, $12.00  Spaghetti w/Meatballs & Sausage, $19.50 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-restaurant-of-distinction-phoenix?select=g6rybW0TkoO10ItXCbJDyg#g6rybW0TkoO10ItXCbJDyg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/avan...</a>  Tortellini, Lasagna, Gnocchi (custom made sampler appetizer) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-restaurant-of-distinction-phoenix?select=OnKBcxrDWW269Z9ZAQ0hRg#OnKBcxrDWW269Z9ZAQ0hRg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/avan...</a>  Tiramisu <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/avanti-restaurant-of-distinction-phoenix?select=BzrmZfblwrBYIB0-5JpAKw#BzrmZfblwrBYIB0-5JpAKw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/avan...</a>  The best part about our experience here is the service.  On one of our visits, when we asked the server if they had Gnocchi, he said \"We don't have it as a separate dish, but we can make something for you\".  The Better Half ordered a plate for dinner that evening.  On another visit, the server noticed that I was on the fence between the Lasagna, Gnocchi, and Tortellini....so he brought out a small sampler plate for me so I could try all 3 before I made my decision....awesome!  As far as the food, it's pretty good.  My fav's are the Gnocchi, Tortellini, and the Spaghetti.  You can't go wrong with any of them.  Return Factor - 87%",

    "text": "For starters let me begin by telling you that this was not my choice to come here for my birthday after a long day of activities where I had maybe 2 drinks in the morning and by 10 O'clock after the Dodgers and Giants game had a severe migraine so bad that I was becoming severely nauseous to where all I really really wanted was a small cup of coffee in hopes to get rid of the migraine so I would be able to eat some of my food.  So when men want to sit here and criticize my review by saying I was a \"drunk\" that is far from what I am EVER.  The ambiance of this place is nothing amazing with its outdated decor going on.  The waiters are all men and have been with the establishment for years on end besides the waiter we had which he says he was there for 7 months and said he was waiting tables for over 20 years (so he says) I found that hard to believe for some reason since the whole time we were there he not once brought out my coffee.  Also when I had ordered risotto my step-dad had told my sister and I that if we didn't want to eat now (because we were just eating over at chase field for the dodgers and dbacks game) that we could save the food for later which was WHY i ordered food in the first place. I had no intention to order to be perfectly honest.  I am kind of wishing I NEVER ordered anything at all the way all of the waiters and chef came out to basically yell at me for not touching my food. I really wish i was so  sick that i would have thrown up all over the place the way they were treating me on my birthday I felt so bullied.  So when OUR waiter took my food to be bagged up to take home he never brought it out for me to take home.  Yet my families food all got packaged up and brought back within a matter of seconds. Our waiter then brought out a very soggy tiramisu in which I have never had it that way ever and googled to see if I have just been eating it the wrong way my whole entire life.  No where on google does it say that its supposed to be that soggy.   It was not until we were almost home I had forgotten my food since it was never once brought back out like we wasted our money for not eating my food right then and there. If im not mistaken i am pretty sure that the owner and chef were the same person.  In that case I will not be recommending this place to anyone in the future if the owner is that much of a douchebag to with hold my food because I was feeling so sick and just wanted some coffee the whole time I was there.  I should not have to repeat myself to have to ask for things consistently.  It is the waiters job to assess the situation and to be understanding.  Not to be a jerk the whole time and not ask if there was anything else he could have got me besides my food. like...my Coffee!  Lastly I'm pretty sure I have a right to my own opinion, everyone that likes this place and I have been multiple times now usually tend to send me hate mail for typing this review.  Every single time the food in my opinion has not been epic or even close to it. So please stop judging me for just one of the times I've went I'm not typing up all the other two times minimum I've been not including my birthday visit.",

    "text": "This is a different review because this time I had Avanti's food at the Italian Festival in Scottsdale. Although I have been to their restaurant a few years ago and found it overpriced with below average food at that time.   This time it's about the attitude of the 'chef' and the food. my wife (a veggie) thought she'd try the veggie lasagna, When she got to the front and ordered they were out of it. The fat, sweaty chef if that's who he was couldn't just say \"sorry we're out\" but had to respond \"too bad lady, you snooze, you lose.\"    Completely uncalled for. My wife is a kind, polite woman. Maybe he thought they were actually the bomb because of the line, but there were very few food vendors. She refused to order anything else and we watched him treat others with a similar curt, obnoxious manner. He doled out tiny servings of other dishes as we watched, and for $8   I'm so glad I ordered sausage and peppers from another vendor. because it was delicious and when I tried the Avanti gnocchi that a friend ordered it was terrible. It was like it came out of a can.  Mushy and in a gooey tasteless white sauce. I understand that it was pre-made but I'd never go to the restaurant after that food and attitude. Off topic, the Italian Fest was awesome. Great entertainment and well attended. Hope there's more food next year!",

Loved the atmosphere, food, service - can't say enough good things.  We started with an app, shared a salad (which the kitchen split for us), both ordered seafood pasta dishes (scallops and shrimp were delicious) and because we were celebrating, our server brought us out a small piece of tiramisu to share!  Love from beginning to end.  Thank you Avanti for a wonderful birthday experience.",

The inside is very dated but at the same time kind of fun. The all-male waitstaff is very attentive and very nice, The food was exceptional. I don't think I've ever had cannelloni as good as I had here. My husband's escargot and veal parm were excellent. The escargot was NOT \"chewy\" like pencil erasers as some restaurants serve. The creme brulee was so-so but interesting because there were raspberries on the bottom and a couple of strawberries on the top. I thought the cream was a little too runny, but some people like it that way. I would go back to try the lasagna.",

    "text": "Avanti is probably my favourite Italian restaurant. The food is excellent and the atmosphere reminds me of an old mobster hang out - not the gritty kind you see on B movies. Rather, it is casually posh.  Located just east of 27th Street on Thomas road, this cozy place is a quiet gem. There is plenty of parking in front of the restaurant. No valet needed, which is a nice perk in Phoenix. When you walk in, the decor is purposefully outdated in black and white art-deco design, mirrored walls and little alcoves where you can sit in semi privacy. It is usually subdued here - no need to shout at your dinner mates. I really like that.  Even better, the food is superb! I've never eaten in Italy, but I imagine this comes very close to Italian perfection. The pasta is so flavourful, I imagine a little old Italian lady, rolling the stuff by hand. Perfection on a plate. My favourite is their gnocchi. Little pillows of heaven, I tell you, and the accompanying sauce is amazing! I even secretly swiped my finger across the plate and licked it clean when no one was looking (don't tell on me!). I've tried several of their entree dishes too and have yet to be disappointed. The double pork chop is cooked to perfection - tender and juicy on the inside, nicely seared on the outside; and served with a delicious risotto that has me wanting to lick my plate again. If you are looking for a hearty pasta dish, I recommend the Pappardelle with the braised beef ragu.   One of my favourite things about this restaurant is the atmosphere. From the moment you walk in the door, you have the impression of being in an old, Italian family restaurant from the center of Little Italy New York. Fogeddaboutit! Posh enough to take your date to, but not snobby by any means. Our wait staff have always been personable, attentive and casual. Prices are very reasonable, especially considering the quality and quantity of your meal.  We generally spend $20-30 per dish, plus an appetizer and some wine.  Oh! And their wine selection is terrific. Even their house wines are great. Take your waiter's recommendation on wine with your dish. You will not be disappointed!",

After offering us pepper for our salad  and we agreed to have some he walked away and never brought it to the table. The owner was awesome and the spaghetti was good. The bathrooms were disgusting and the drink list was very limited.

Our friends and family raved about the food for months after our wedding. They truly provided a lovely experience for us and it was nice to have someone open to working with our budget.  We went back for dinner and was very disappointed. I got the lasagna that we had from our rehearsal dinner. It was so burnt on one of the edges it was basically inedible. They replaced it with a new one and gave us a bottle of wine for free since all 4 of us had issues with our orders. I give them 5 for customer service, but sadly I feel this place has become a case for Robert Irvine's Restaurant Impossible. We won't be going back anytime soon unfortunately.",

    "text": "Ok, so this was the first review I ever wrote on Yelp. This restaurant was the whole reason I even joined Yelp. It has and will always be my favorite restaurant in the valley. You may not get it, but that's because you probably suck.   First off, this place is totally dated. It's dated because that's part of it's charm. This was the place to dine back in the 80's and early 90's. My grandfather only ate at 3 restaurants in the valley back then: Avanti, El Chorro on Lincoln, and Don & Charlie's. He liked being treated well and these places never missed a beat. Of course, times change, but this is why I will always love this restaurant. It has been consistently good my whole life. Also, it should be noted, if you treat your waiters well, they treat you well. Gramps was a big tipper and he got treated very well. When he made a reservation, he made it with the same waiter, for like 20 years. Ok, maybe not that long, but long enough that he saw my mom through two marriages and several relationships. Well, maybe 20 years isn't off the mark? His drink of choice, vodka on the rocks with anchovy stuffed olives, would be sitting at his table waiting by the time we sat down. Not many restaurants can pull that off.   So yeah, I am probably biased. But I am biased because I have had some great times in this place over the years. To this day, I never order gnocchi anywhere else. It's always a disappointment.   It's True, though, the vibe isn't the same as it once was. For one, nobody knows how to dine anymore. Dinner used to be an event. You ordered at least two rounds of drinks before you even considered ordering food. How are you supposed to get a buzz on otherwise? Then you would order some apps/starters, then a main course, then dessert and after dinner drinks. This is the kind of place you spent some time in. This is the kind of place that used to require some proper dining etiquette. I don't find this happening much anymore at Avanti. There hasn't even been a need for valet on my visits over the last several years. That's not a bad thing. Just an observation. Times are changing, and people don't have the money to spend on dinner they used to. One thing that hasn't changed, though, is the food. So I will continue to go back, even if I don't have the time to \"dine.\" I will go back, even though it will always have to be without my grandfather. I will go back just to get a sliver of what this place used to be back in the day ... which was, wait for it, legendary.",

Lobster, halibut, scallops, linguine, and veggies, it was perfectly topped with a spicy red sauce. The salad was so crunchy and their Caesar dressing was definitely the best I've ever had. Ingredients were super fresh all the way around. The appetizer was on point as well. Also, best bruschetta I do believe I have ever had. And finally the creme brulee, mixed with strawberries--ahh I cannot get enough of this place.",

Desserts were all amazing with many made in house. House cabernet was average so go with a better bottle from the wine list.  This is the real Italian deal with the owner almost always present, about 40 years same location, many employees that have worked there for decades. They must be doing something right!  PS This place is a little jewel in a so-so neighborhood but parking is right in front & we felt safe even when all the lights in the restaurant and the neighborhood went out last night. Conveniently located near the 51 & Thomas Rd in central Phoenix.",

Sunday night 8:00 p.m. dinner and there was hardly anyone in the restaurant, but this is totally odd, because the food is soooo very good.  Hand made fresh pasta very well done.  This restaurant is a must for Italian food.  Near the airport area - good location.    I had the homemade lasagna and you could really tell the difference in the quality of hand made fresh pasta.  The sauce is a combination of red meat sauce with some white sauce and a lot of cheese.  It works!  Fantastic!",

The other pastas that came on my plate were just so-so.  The best part of our meal was the service.  The waiter was very friendly and attentive and willing to accomodate people's requests.  Sadly, I can't imagine coming back here because our bill came out close to $85/person (although admittedly we did have two drinks each).",

I understand some restaurants have this policy for large parties but have never come across the tip being hand written and totaled for you and 20% is the highest percentage I have come across to date. It was strange to me and did not sit well so I decided to call and ask what the policy is. The man who answered said they do not have a policy where they ever include gratuity - I clarified \"Even with large parties?\" He confirmed. I then explained the experience we had and he back pedaled.. \"Oh yes, large parties, that is our policy.\"  It's unfortunate, because everything was great - we were planning on going for Mother's Day brunch but now we will not return. My husband and I come from the restaurant industry and would have tipped over 20% for sure and I can't help but wonder if the fact that we were a table of African Americans had anything to do with this.",

Their Gnocchis are just fluffy melt in your mouth pillows. I am telling you they know what they're doing in here.

The moment we walked in, we were handed the first wine of the evening, and within 10 minutes of sitting in the bar, we received the first round of appetizers. Despite it being a large crowd, the courses progressed steadily throughout the evening with everyone receiving theirs within minutes. The food was very good, nice portions, and went well with the wines except for the dessert course (a dry red which I think was chosen by the winery-not the chef). And the wine pours were VERY generous. We look forward to attending more wine dinners in the future!",

So don't go here expecting a good view. There were these globes hanging from the ceiling by paper clips. The whole thing was bad. Also we were the only people under the age of 65 in there. Defiantly an older crowd.  Butttttt The food was great! My date got spaghetti which wasn't anything special. It didn't have enough sauce on it and it just was whatever. But my food was fantastic!! I got the pene al fadoro. Or something like that and It was so good! This place is a little over priced for what you get. I wouldn't ever go here again even as much as I liked my food because of the atmosphere and price.",

We had gnocchi, perfectly cooked, pasta with vodka sauce, perfectly cooked, and shrimp cocktail which was very tasty. Then we had the meat lasagna and ossobucco which were excellent. For dessert the chocolate mousse was very good. The waiter, Jon, was a delight! Knowledgable about menu, wine and just fun to talk to. Btw this is one of only a handful of restaurants that allow a corking fee. Most of the other Italian restaurant we called for reservations didn't provide this service. I recommend Avanti!!

I enjoyed linguine with clams in a white wine sauce. Delicious! We also shared a Cesar salad and an amazing slice of tiramisu.   The decor was not what I expected, but I really liked the funky feel.

Nothing has changed it's dark and outdated. They need a Ramsey make over for sure.   The service was good although it was very difficult to understand our waiter he had an extremely thick accent.   The Caesar salad was very good. The veal parm which is my favorite of all time was not good. The veal was rubbery and the breading soggy. The pasta was way overcooked although the sauce was good.   The Tiramisu was soggy as well. The cake at the bottom was soaking wet. Yuck  If not for the groupon I would have sent this back. But half off an overpriced meal made me think I got what I paid for.   Well we had another groupon to use so we went back. The second time the service and atmosphere the same.   Me thinks there is a microwave doing heavy duty in the back. This time I had seafood risotto BLUCK! The Risotto was undercooked and had no flavor. The seafood tasted dirty and there was grit in my shrimp. This Risotto was a disaster! My friends vegetables were mush. It was worse than the first visit.   The worst part of both visits is that the restaurant was almost empty on a Sunday evening and the food was sub par it makes no sense to me.   The long and the short of it I wont be back. Avanti's has slipped to Olive Garden level with Macaroni Grill prices! WAY OVER PRICED.",

    "text": "Went here last night with my mom for Restaurant Week & I was just floored with how good their food AND service was. We were there past rush hour so we pretty much had the place to ourselves & we got nothing but rockstar service from their waiter John. Such a nice man, he knew the whole history of the restaurant & it just made me fall in love with the place. I had the Caesar salad (best caesar I've had in awhile, drenched in dressing yet the lettuce was still crunchy...how did they do it???) My main course was the lobster, which I promptly devoured. It was so delicious I wish I could have it again for lunch! I was so full I didn't eat my desert till I got home, but even that was good an hour after getting home! Thank you guys for such a wonderful night with my mom. I couldn't have asked for better quality service & food. I can't WAIT to bring my friends & show off this wonderful gem.",

Both were the best we've ever had!   In addition the atmosphere was enhanced by the beautiful piano music being played in the bar area. All of the wait staff were friendly and helpful making the evening one to remember! Angelo the owner was onsite greeting all the diners and made us feel like we were having dinner with long time friends.  If you're looking for a fabulous Italian meal this is the place to be!",

Ambiance: ** quite dark, no windows, low ceiling.  Felt like I was in someone's basement. Food:  ** Had the trio of pasta.  Ravioli - seafood sauce was great but the ravioli skin was too thick and hard.  Fettucini - tomato sauce was okay and pasta was ok.  Gnocchi - okay. Tiramisu - too soggy.  Cesar Salad - good but a bit too much dressing. Cost: * Overpriced for the quality of food.  It was fairly packed on a Saturday night.  90% of the diners were 50+.    I most likely won't return.  There are far too many other Italian restaurants in the valley with better quality food and atmosphere.  They really need to remodel.",

Our service was fine, but the food was undercooked (they breaded the halibut!??!?), mushy, and tasted several days old. This experience would have been forgettable and/or forgiveable if they weren't also charging $35/plate for the halibut \"special\". There are so many other restaurants nearby that charge less for a much better food experience. Bottom line, avoid Avanti.",

I also recommend the tiramisu with a shot of grappa. The owner always checks in during the meal to make sure you are completely satisfied. I really wish this place got more credit and attention that it deserves because it really is a long standing and reliable excellent dining location. The decor is traditional and classic. This isn't your trendy yuppy sushi place with EDM blasting. They have classic Italian favorites quietly adding to the relaxing ambiance. All of the tables are meticulously outfitted with the proper table wear. Most of the staff have worked there for years. They care about the restaurant and their customers. Avanti's is a special Phoenix dining experience.",

The restaurant has been around for over 40 years, and when you walk inside, it's like a trip back in time.  The decor is old school, which we love!  The waiters were all so friendly and helpful.  We were immediately greeted with a smile and shown to our table.  The garlic bread was yummy!!  It was garlicky and soft.  For our starters, I had the classic caesar salad, which was dressed perfectly and the dressing was not overpowering.  Hubby had the mixed greens vinaigrette, and he loved it!    My entree was the chicken parmigiana with spaghetti on the side.  The chicken parm wasn't heavily breaded, which made it taste lighter and was so moist.  The spaghetti was just as delicious, and there was so much, it's already in the fridge ready to be my lunch for work tomorrow.  Hubby got the classic meat lasagna, which was served in a bowled plate on a bed of \"white gravy\".  I think he adored it, because I caught him licking the sauce off his plate, by the end of the meal, it looked completely clean.  For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse.  It literally melted in my mouth, and wasn't overly sweet...a perfect ending to my dinner.  Hubby had the flan, which was silky and sweet.  This was a wonderful meal for a Sunday night...to get us ready for the week ahead.  We'll definitely be back!!",

Some complain that Avanti's decor is outdated & it is BUT that is what makes it charming. Our party went for dinner during the weekend & staff were serious about providing efficient & sincere friendly service from beginning to end. The food was deemed incredible by everyone in our party. The table tried the jumbo shrimp appetizer stuffed with crab meat, spinach & ricotta cheese. Some explored the pork tenderloin with mushrooms soaking in wine, grouper fish with mixed veggies, a pasta trio & a kid loving a big plate of chicken fettuccine Alfredo. The hot bread in a basket oiled up was delicious. Dessert was just as wonderful. Our bill was close to $200 for a party of four but we left totally satisfied about food quality, quantity, cleanliness & incredible attention to service. We'll definitely return.",

We are paying customers... a simple \"I'm sorry let me get you a napkin\" would have avoided this review...   The food wasn't bad, but I promise it wasn't anything to write home about.

Quick way to kill another $20 bill on a fixed income.    I will be back, but I guess I need to come with a date as in the past over the years - prices are higher than I remembered  So, I gave three stars mainly due to the high prices, since the food was good as usual, but service at the bar wasn't quite up to par. We had a hard time understanding our server, plus my friend ordered her favorite, a gin & tonic, and they had no tonic!  The set-up and food delivery time were quite efficient.",

From the outside we became somewhat concerned. First this is not the best part of town, the parking lot was empty, and it was around 5:30. It was however midweek and I'm a no fear kind of guy, so we enter and my wife and I look at each other and smile. What a surprise. It was as if we fell back in time, 1970 something. Low ceilings, lots of mirrors on the walls, crystal lighting and shinny glassware everywhere. Photos of celebrities that have visited are hung in the entryway you first enter. All the tables have white linen tablecloths on them. And all the weight staff were older Italian gentleman. And yes they spoke with an Italian accent. As we became aware of The softly playing music in the background we heard who else but Tony Bennett. Just perfect. We of course had the special, but while looking at the menu my wife and I knew we were coming back. The lobster was cooked perfectly, the pasta as well cooked perfectly and the sauce had just the right amount of spice as should with seafood. If your looking for someplace to have Italian like it's supposed to be and take a step back in time then Avanti is a place you must go to.",

Then Chef Angelino also came by and welcomed us even with a full house, great customer service and very welcoming!   We declined dessert only cause the food was so amazing and filling, we had no room. We were wrong when Sergio placed a trio plate of their desserts!

My guest thoroughly enjoyed her perfectly cooked Parmesan crusted salmon.  She shared a bit and I can understand why.  I had chicken Francese, which was flavorful though tough (overcooked?) complimented by a scant few capers and a single, quartered artichoke heart.  Could have been...but wasn't.

I have had a lot of calamari fritti, and I have to say Avanti's is the best. Not overly greasy and very crispy. Their gnocchi and risotto have also been amazing. The owner, Angelo, will make it around to you if he is there. I have also sat at the bar with friends and had some good conversations with John, who has been there for the long haul. The service is great, but a little different from what people are used to (servers dropping off the check at their convenience, etc.). Avanti's servers want you to have an elegant dining experience, and they are mindful of your experience. They will not clear your plates until they are absolutely sure you are finished or give them a signal (napkin on plate or even a nod). If you have wine to finish, they will stand back and let you enjoy it and the company you're with, even if they have locked the doors and want to go home. My party and I have been the last to leave on a couple of occasions, and they are greatful for your patronage and do not act at all put out for being there a little later. They are attentive without being pushy or intrusive. That is class. Yes, the prices may be higher than what you would pay at some other Italian restaurants, but I believe you are also paying for the experience and great service on top of the delicious food.",

Even though this was our first time dinning here, the waitstaff made us feel like we were regulars. The food was amazing. The fried calamari was cooked perfectly and paired with a great tasting spicy marinara. The salads were average but good, and the entrees really stood out. I had the Veal Marsala, which was off the charts. After 35 years these guys know how to cook veal. It was pounded very thin and melted in my mouth. The lady had the salmon, which was parmesean crusted and very good. It was mild and wonderful. The tiramisu for dessert was also great. Next time though i will get the pasta as the were making it fresh in the restauraunt. I have to give that a try. The ambiance was great. I don't think they have changed anything since it opened in 1974. It's not trendy or chic but it is classy and takes you back in time. It does seem like it attracts an older generation, but if more people try this food they will flock there in droves. I can not wait to go back.",

    "text": "Started off with the garlic bread - nothing special but done right, next was Insalata Capricciosa - salad greens, dressed with balsamic vinegar and creamy flavorful gorgonzola cheese, which stayed crisp even after an hour.  The \"Involtini of Eggplant\" with mozzarella and fontina with tomato basil sauce was excellent.  While my love and I waited for the shared main course of eggplant lasagna, I happened to chat up the courteous and attentive waiter who mentioned the specialty of the house - pasta made in house.  So we visited the pasta chef who proudly showed off the spinach-ricotta ravioli, pappardelle, fettucini and gnocchi.  Since my partner was nursing a leg injury, the pasta chef brought the tray over to our table and suggested we try the gnocchi with alfredo sauce.  The gnocchi were the melt-in-your-mouth kind and the sauce was a tomato enhanced alfredo - very flavorful.   Full from the appetizer, salad and gnocchi, we decided to take the eggplant lasagna home so that we could taste the home made \"tiramisu\".  Again, the tiramisu was incredible - the liquer flowing as your fork went through the dessert which was flavorful, not too sweet and coated the mouth.  We had the left over gnocchi and eggplant lasagna the next day - what a treat as a leftover.  Overall the service was great, food was excellent.  The ambiance is as explained by other reviewers, customers were dressed from casual to formal.  Decide to go here because as out of towners we not only could find the world famous pizzeria, but it had a 3 hour wait for dinner.   Talked with one of the owners of Avanti on the phone, who sounded welcoming and accommodating too.  We also cashed in on a rarely extended favor which helped make our decision instantly.  All the facts from the other reviewers are accurate - the 70s interior, the clientele, the owners etc.  Pending more visits, Avanti may get the 5 star rating after all.",

Super clean dining room with polished stemware, orderly table settings, and pretty lighting make for a gracious environment. The staff was courteous and attentive, the food was classic and delicious. I had the osso bucco -- totally melt-in-the-mouth meat in a flavorful sauce served over creamy risotto with the perfect al dente kernel.

    "text": "As I lie here on the couch with the worst stomach cramps imaginable (hoping that death comes soon), I curse Avanti under my breathe. Yesterday was Valentine's Day and it was chaos! We made our reservations months ago and we were both really excited to go. My boyfriend had been many times, years ago, but I had never been.  The decor is very \"Scarface\" (think 1980's nightclub/strip club). When we walked into the bar, I asked my boyfriend where the stripper poles were (mirrors are everywhere and there is black and white leopard fabric on the booths--seemed like a legitimate question). It was fun though, in a retro kind of way. We sat in the bar and had a drink while we waited for the hostess line (which was out the door) to die down (it never did). They hired a temp bartender to handle the extra volume but they waited to hire her until that afternoon. The poor thing didn't know where anything was. Total disaster!  When we were done with our drinks, we went into the dining room, but we had to seat ourselves. Apparently, the hostess had told my boyfriend where our table was and then directed him to seat himself because she was too busy. Interesting strategy.  The tables were practically on top of each other (the owner really packed them in) and were so close that you could hear every conversation--it was like sitting at a community table. Not exactly the best environment for Valentine's Day. We ended up befriending the couple at the table six inches to the right of us, which was nice, but odd, considering the special day.   The food took forever (each course took 30 to 45 minutes to be delivered to the table). We sat ourselves at our table at 6:30 pm and didn't get our check until 9 pm. We shared an appetizer, and then we both had a salad and an entree. For an appetizer we shared the stuffed shrimp (two shrimps for $14). They arrived cold but had good flavor. We both had Caesar salads, which didn't have any croutons, but tasted okay. We weren't offered fresh cracked pepper (standard practice), which really irritated me. We both had the Osso Bucco for an entree. It was so salty, I couldn't eat more than two bites! I slammed two glasses of water afterwards. There was so much salt, I could hear the crunch of the salt crystals after the second bite. It tasted like they just dumped salt on the dish. It was very tender though. The lady at the table next to us ordered some pork dish and because we were practically sharing a table, I heard her tell her husband that there were clumps of unmixed corn starch in the gravy on her dish. She was pretty grossed out.   Additionally, I did not enjoy the cattle call method the front of the house started to use to seat people. As the evening wore on, they took to shouting out names! You're trying to have a romantic evening and then some guy shouts, \"Tim, your table is ready! TIM!!\" Even sports bars use pagers so they don't have to scream your name.  I also figured out that they increased the cost for all the dishes on their limited Valentine's Day menu. So, their winning business model on a romantic holiday appears to be: cram too many people into the restaurant, jack up the prices, decrease the portion sizes, offer poor quality food that takes forever to get, and top it off with lackluster service. Great strategy for repeat business! Which brings me to my last complaint. When we got home, I was hoping to forget the whole night and just relax. Didn't happen. I spent the entire night (and most of today) in the bathroom, sick as a dog. Very romantic. I have no idea what made me so sick, but if I had to venture a guess, it was probably the Caesar salad dressing (homemade dressing uses raw eggs). I'm now laid up on the couch, missing work, and drinking Pepto Bismol like my life depends on it.   Bottom line: This restaurant probably lived up to its reputation many years ago, but its standards for quality appear to have evaporated. Visit this place at your own risk.",

Think elegant 80s chic, right down to the zebra striped chairs. The service is spot on; this isn't your chain joint with some struggling actor as your server. All the servers here know their menu and their wine pairings. The food is the icing on the cake! Everything here is authentic italian, and it is downright delicious! The boo and I had bruschetta as a starter, then moved on to the pasta trio with the gnocchi, vodka sauce penne and fettuccine alfredo. Everything was creamy and cooked to perfection, and we finished with their tiramisu, which was divine. Drinks were strong and were perfect; they have an excellent martini here! All in all five stars, this is an excellent place for birthdays, romantic dinners, and special occasions. Avanti has lots of character, check it out!",

'No problem' said Jon, our waiter and he had the chef prepare a delicious risotto primavera for us.    The only thing not superior was the tiramisu.

I had a double thick stuffed veal chop. Both dinners were excellent obviously each prepared with much care to detail.    We were so full, we didn't have room for dessert. There was a piano player playing softly in the bar. The dining room was quiet and candle lit, perfect for a special adult night out.

He took the appetizer order from 3 people and left the table without taking order from the other two. He didnt return till the appetizers came out from the original order. The apps were fantastic! (Stuffed Shrimp, Shrimp Cocktail and Salmon). We asked about the price fixed menu for $60 and he didnt really know much about it. We ordered out entrees and they arrived rather quickly. The entrees where very bland and lacked flavor and substance. I have had way better food at Olive garden, which is really sad for the price of the food.  Very disappointed.",

It was because of Oscar, a 12 year veteran of the 37 year old restuarant, that we had such an incredible experience.  His thick Italian accent was a great kick off to the experience.  He not only helped steer me between two wines I couldn't choose between, but he also placed the bottle far enough from our reach to make sure that he was the one topping us every time.  He made impeccable recommendations on the menu, and timed the delivery of our food, dessert, and check perfectly.  We felt important; not rushed.  I made sure to ask for his weekly schedule before I left so that I make sure he is there to wait on us for future visits.",

The food was good, yet overpriced with a bill in excess of $70 consisting of iced tea, two dinner salads and two entrees. Beyond the inflated price, the presentation was instead anemic with with minimal effort to  please the eye. The most convincing issue was the poor service; our waiter was absolutely off putting, bordering rude. He made no efforts to engage us in a polite way, especially when we initially requested water to drink when we had just been sat. I saw his interest deflate as quickly as he calculated what his potential tip without adding wine to the bill. Little did he consider that we needed a little time to settle in and determine what wine would pair well with our entree. Equally, my interest in prolonging our experience at Avanti's waned and we decided to go elsewhere for dessert. Upon ordering, I had to take it upon myself to ask my date what she wanted to eat and drink. He made no effort, no attempt to look us in the eye or even exchange pleasantries, including when he dropped off the bill.There was no \"thank you\", no smile, nothing. I will not go back again for I know of other restaurants that show passion for what they do in their food and in their service. At Avanti's, I felt like a number and no more.",

I've been going to Avanti for thirty years and always had a good experience.  This is the first time that I was so utterly unimpressed and even commented that I would not be returning.  Not only was the food mediocre but the service was impudent at best.  Our waiter asked if we wanted drinks.  I asked for a listing of wines by the glass, and he basically refused to give me a written listing.  He asked whether I wanted red or white, and I said red.  My friend said she preferred a red zinfandel and asked if they had zinfandel. I said I would like to know something about the wine I was ordering, and the waiter said they had a good Rombauer in both cabernet and zinfandel and described it in glowing terms, adding that they also had house wine.  He mentioned $8 and we thought he was talking about the Rombauer.  We ordered the Rombauer - one cab and one zin.  When we got the bills, the wine was $18, so we asked if he had billed us for two glasses.  No, he said, the Rombauer was $18 a glass.  I said \"you didn't tell us that\" and he said he was sure he had....  Well, we looked at the wine list by the glass on the way out of the restaurant.  The Rombauer wasn't even listed, and they had no wines by the glass for more than $15.  We felt the whole thing was a rip-off and will not be returning.",

    "text": "Visited this restaurant again November 21 or 22 (Thanksgiving ate my sense of time for that week).  The experience did not improve my initial opinion.  We used the $90 meal groupon.  For $45, we had a choice of two salads, one entree, and a special dessert menu, which meant fewer choices with the groupon than without.  While my husband had no complaints about his Caesar salad, my greens were sour tasting.  However, this salad far outranked the dessert -- Tiramisu, soggy throughout and wet at the bottom.  The special entree was the same three pasta dish as we chose last time, and the results were the same.  I am so pleased we did not pay the full cost of the meal.  For $45, we could have had a much better meal at many other Valley Italian restaurants  The service and wine were good, but that hardly matters when the food is not.  Won't be trying this restaurant again.  We had dinner at this restaurant on Friday October 28 using a Groupon coupon that saved us $30.  Pluses on this occasion were decor, piano, service, wine, salads, and desert.   Both the Insalata Capricciosa and the Caesar Salad for One were very good, the greens being fresh, the dressings just right , the gorgonola cheese on the Insalata exceptional.  The amaretto cheesecake with strawberry slices we shared was amazing.  Avanti describes the restaurant as suitable for \"quiet romance.\"  While the ambience is pleasant, lighting is too bright for a romantic evening.  Negatives were the entrees.  A veal  cut 1/4 to 3/8 inches thick, overcooked, the thinner part crusty flavored burned, and the breading mushy was slathered with a mediocre sauce, cheese melted on top.  This version of veal parmegiana shared the plate with overcooked pasta in a meat sauce.  Our second entree was a three kinds of pasta plate, with the pesto pasta being the only one of the three we liked.   When the main part of a meal is disappointing, the meal fails no matter how good everything else might be. Neverthethess, salad with wine followed by desert with coffee would make a nice lunch.  And we did not try appetizers.  If we return, I hope we can write a better review.",

We had a Saturday reservation at 7 and sat at the table for 20 minutes before anyone showed up with water or menus.  Another 15 minutes to order and then the waiter, who couldn't have been more rushed and unpleasant, told us the food was going to take \"at least 30 minutes\" (even for the appetizers) because they were busy.  Really?  Saturday night at 7 and the entire staff is overwhelmed, rushing and irritable?    Finally the food came and all 4 entrees were very disappointing.  The linguini with clams was so saturated in salty oil, the canned minced clams very over cooked and rubbery, the garlic so strong, it was actually the worst I've ever had. Then, another 15 minute wait to find our waiter to get the check who thought he'd fool us and act pleasant for the only time during the hour 45 minute ordeal in an effort to get a better tip.   We're done.  Never again.   The food and service were so bad...it felt insulting.",

Thank you for showing me what bad customer service is and for making my night less great.",

    "text": "Open Table had great reviews for this place so had to try it out while I was in town for Spring Break. Reservations were for 7:30pm and were seated promptly. Restaurant is an open seating area and although there were only a few open tables it didn't feel crowed at all and was not loud. All the servers are mature in age and were very attentive and knew the menu through and through. The crowd was older as well, late 40's and up. Super chill environment.   Started out with the Oysters Rockafeller - creamy and delicious, not salty and piping hot!!  Garlic bread came out fresh and warm. Not super garlicky or over buttery.   Opted for the Minestrone and I'm sooo glad I did because it was DELICIOUS!! It had large chunks of zucchini, white beans and broccoli, broth is amazing!! Rich in flavor but not overpowering and light, not salty and i didnt have to add salt or pepper to it.   Dinner I had the Cioppino. Its a very large portion, lots of seafood, shrimp, mussels, squid, scallops, clams, octopus. Tomato based sauce, melt in your mouth white fish (halibut? Cod?)  And of course had to try out the tiramisu because I saw another reviewer who said it was a must try. I was not disappointed! It's rich and moist and homemade so I suggest you don't pass up the opportunity to try it!  The owner was walking around getting drink orders, clearing plates and making sure all of his patrons were satisfied.",

    "text": "I walked into Florence, Italia when I arrived at this restaurant. Gingham tablecloths, black and white checkered tiles, the aroma of garlic and sound of glasses of wine clinking together. Avanti is so picturesque it looks like something straight out of the '80's.   I dined and drank here with a friend on a Saturday night and our waiter gave us the choice to either sit in the front dining area or by the bar where the pianist was playing some tunes. We chose the bar area.   *Service* The staff here is SO friendly and welcoming. I felt like family was greeting me, seating me, and serving me by the way the treated us. It's crazy how far just one smile can go, but just think of how far smiles all night during dinner can go?? *Applause to that* Our waiter even got us a refill of wine for free. Praise him. We were treated like royalty.  *Entertainment*  The talented pianist was playing requests on cue. My favorite part of the entertainment portion of the night was when a music teacher walked in, quietly sat at the bar, went up to the pianist, said hello, and began to pull out his bass, and harmonize with the pianist!   Now let's move on to the food:   *Food*  Pasta Trio- My friend and I shared a trio dish that came with tortellini, gnocchi, and penne al forno  Crem Brulee- for dessert! served with berries on top. The fruit was fresh, the hard sugar on top was delicious, and the flan itself was tasty, but a little bit grainy. Not going to complain though. I ate every last bite ;)   This is an amazing restaurant for a romantic date or just to get your Italian fix in.  Check out my food pics on my Insta: @deeps.eats =)",

    "text": "My wife and I dined here for the first time yesterday with a group of new friends, including some long time Phoenicians. Before coming here I read many of the reviews, noticing that they were predominantly 4-5 stars, with a few 1-2 stars thrown into the mix. Love it or hate it, seems to be the mode for most of the reviewers.   For the long time residents, Avanti's holds a bit of True nostalgia, as it brings back fond memories of special occasions, which forms an important part of the dinning experience. Being relatively new to Phoenix this was not a factor for us, we judged the restaurant for what it is today. This included:  Great service from Andrew and his team. Great food: Since we were a group of 14 we had agreed to a special meal: Caprese Salad, Pasta Trio or Stuffed Sole and Tiramisu. The pasta is made on site,(we were advised by a friend who has dined there since she was a young girl). The Sole (stuffed with crab and scallops) was delicious and perfectly done. The dinner was a good value for the price. Music : After dinner we adjourned to the bar to listen to Charles on the piano. This was definitely a throwback to the old school ways of entertaining in an era that brings back a memorable 'Rat Pack' kind of nostalgia (If you have to google 'Rat Pack', this restaurant is probably not for you). Atmosphere: Since we were a large group we had a private room, thus we were not in the main dining room. That worked well for us. The bar area and main dining room are unique, and would not be for everyone's taste. If you want slick modern decor, with a vibrant young crowd, your not going to find it here. If you want good solid, old school Italian food, good service, great piano music, strong drinks and good wine, then you will find it at Avanti.  I will look forward to future experiences at this Phoenix icon.",

Durant's is old school.  And it's cool. Where else are you going for red-flocked wall paper?  Ice in the urinals?  The problem is, the last 5 visits at Durant's, the best part of the visit WAS the red-flocked wall paper.  Not the flavor of a $50 steak.  No, RED FLOCKED WALL PAPER AND ICE IN THE URINALS, not a great steak.  And priced like Ocean Club, a good steak, not a great steak.    Avanti is just old. Old food, no flavor, think they're furthering the Italian-American cuisine.  They are not.  Forget the old stories about the the Suns getting their cola at Avanti's -- alledgedly -- check the headlines. Point is, Avanti has been around forever. FOREVER and it tastes like it.   My meal was overpriced, undersized and not al dente'...Mr. Avanti thinks this is 'old school'.  I think it's just old.",

She was quite disappointed that she didn't receive the meal she ordered. They offered to remake the meal but all in the party had received their meals and were already eating, so my wife declined. We were pleased that the restaurant chose to not charge for their mistake.  This is an old classic restaurant with quite a  history and is certainly worth the trip to check it out.",

We weren't sure what to expect, as the restaurant is in a \"fringe\" neighborhood.  As we pulled up the restaurant looked nice and the parking lots was full.  The decor is 70's/80's mobster, but that kind of adds to the charm.  There are plenty of Italian men running around serving people tasty plates of food and wine.  And there are tons of guys in suits everywhere.    We started with fresh pasta (delicious), followed by caesar salad (excellent), and then chicken parm (mmm), and tiramisu and caramel flan (love).  We had a bottle of Stag's Leap Petite Syrah.  (They do a ton of fun wine tastings.) It was packed on a Tuesday night, which was pretty impressive.

We waited at the entrance for a few moments before we were greeted by whom I guess was the owner. He said he had been expecting us, sat us at our table and disappeared for the remainder of the evening.  Our waiter was odd; he seemed to be in a rush and irritated even though the place was empty. For starters we ordered the pasta trio sampler and the Oyster Rockefeller.  The only thing memorable about the sampler was the gnocchi which was as good as most yelpers mentioned. The Rockefeller may have been the worse I've ever had; the oysters were so tiny I could barely discern them in the heavily creamed spinach. I'm not sure how something so creamy can be so utterly bland and flat. For the entree I had the Salmon which again was drowned in a weird sauce that covered the entire plate. The salmon was moist but the sauce was putrid. It tasted at least 3 days old. The sides were cold oven roasted potatoes which again were covered in that odd sauce. For the finale, I tried the Creme Brulee, again that was a mistake. It was ice cold and had chunks of pineapples in it which is not normal nor was it ever mentioned. The top of the brulee was not properly browned and didn't crack when my spoon hit it. I look forward to cracking my Creme Brulee, darn! Needless to say I will never be back here again.",

    "text": "Great, authentic, entertaining, somewhat scary (Good Fellas, Joe Pesci  scary) Italian joint.  And please rest assured that this reviewer does NOT consider Olive Garden as the standard (I wish we could root those folks out and sign them up to a Yelp for Dummies service)...yes, I'm a freakin' elitist, but what can I say?  I am a foodie, and Italian culture reigned supreme for a millenia.    The owner is 100% Italian and runs all over the place making sure all is well.  The wine list is all over the place and mostly phenomenal, very pricey bottles.  We found an excellent Amarone for $60, but you can find some bottles for less.  Wait service was excellent, but totally unpretentious.  This is the real deal folks.  Ask for a pasta sampler plate.  The gnocchi is out of this world.  Escargot was traditionally prepared with butter and garlic, Caprese salad was perfect.  Veal Osobuco with rissoto was out of this world (I usually resist veal as the treatment of the animal is more than I can bare, but man you can hardly go authentic Italian with that attitude!).  Here's the scary part:  There were some mob-looking folks in there, with plastic-surgery wives and fat rings...I could totally picture a scene in the Godfather or Sopranos where someone is dragged down that narrow, long hallway to the bathrooms/back alley by a guitar string wrapped around their neck.  I swear I was peeking around the corner before walking into the bathroom just in case someone had put a hit on my ass!  Luckily I made it out of there alive and very very satisfied.    Spent $150 for 2 including tip and a nice bottle of wine, and we gourged.  I rarely give a place a 10 unless it's very fine dining, but this place came at it from a different angle and was worth every penny.  Enjoy!",

Having reviewed the menu prior to arriving,  we ordered calamari (really good). Veal Marsala veal ossobuco.  Marsala really good, despite extremely small portion; ossobuco, tasted like Sunday roast, nothing special. Even though, the most expensive item on the menu. Then service fell apart. More than an hour expired, from the time dinner was completed until the sever ask us about desert.  We ordered tiramisu, absolutely disgusting. My advise, prior to spending 165 dollars at avanti, seriously consider shopping at AJs and eating at home.",

The food and service was amazing.  We chose this place to celebrate our anniversary based on the PBS program \"Check Please\" rather than go to a chain restaurant,like Carrabbas.  The lasagna was made with homemade fresh noodles and was amazing. Light and very tasty and filling without the \"ugh\" I ate too much feeling after you eat lasagna made from heavy packaged pasta.  The swordfish with capers and wine sauce was delish, as well.  The desert sampler, tiramisu, flan and cannoli was just right and I felt like I was back home in South Philly.  Service was impeccable and we were treated like family (a healthy family). The owner/chef comes around and greets everyone too.  The diners were a mixed group of ages and dress-casual to dressy...very diverse which speaks to its reputation. My  husband had pre-ordered a flower arrangement which was on our table when we arrived. This was a memorable and romantic dining experience...we will certainly go back!",

    "text": "Last night my husband and 27 year old son went to Avanti Restaurant in Phoenix Arizona.  To start off, my son asked for a wine list which he never received and when my husband and I got our drinks, my son changed his mind and said he would just drink water.  There's a reason I am telling that story which you will see later on in my review.  We are from NJ and in AZ because my son is in grad school at ASU and we are visiting him. The restaurant has an old feeling from the moment you walk in.  It seems to be dated back into the 70's with the zebra type upholstery and mirrors all over.  My son ordered escargots and we ordered minestrone soup.  Both were pretty good. My husband ordered lasagna and my son had the cioppino which is like a seafood with pasta and he liked his as well.  To be fair, my husband actually said the lasagna was one of the best he has ever had.  I ordered eggplant parmigiana which is my favorite dish that I order at almost all the Italian restaurants that I go to. I have to say that I did not like it.  It was so filled with garlic that I was overwhelmed.  Also, there was no breading on the eggplant and it was mushy and too soft. There were cheese and bread crumbs lumped on the top which made it even mushier.  I tried but had a hard time eating it.  The waiter kept coming over telling terrible jokes and actually making me feel uncomfortable.  At this point I just wanted to leave and when my family was done eating I preferred to get the check and go.  I decided not to complain because I knew I would never come back and I'm not from here. The check came and when I looked at it I was surprised to see that my eggplant parmigiana was not on the bill but that it was called veal parm and cost $26.95.  I also saw that there was a $10 charge for a glass of wine.  Eggplant parm is ALWAYS decently cheaper than veal parm because it is meat vs. vegetable but when my husband asked the server, he quickly answered \"It's the same thing\" to which I was not happy at all.  Also, my husband asked him to remove the $10 charge for the glass of wine that was never ordered and he said \"Didn't he have a glass of wine?\" Well, no he didn't but had you brought the wine list he originally asked for, he may have!  He ended up taking the $10 charge for the wine off and when we left I went on the website and checked out the dinner menu and saw that Eggplant Parm is not on the menu so they made it for me and charged the highest price for the parmigiana section which I think is awful. The chicken parm is $24.95 and Eggplant Parm cost more than that too?  Totally unacceptable! Their website prices did not match their current menu prices so they should update that as their prices are cheaper on the website. Overall, I felt the server took advantage of us and upped the price of my dish.  Usually I would complain to the manager but I just wanted to leave.  I would not return.",

Very nice restaurant, clean, and the clientele located around you will prove the theory of \"repeat customers\" as most are a little long in the tooth.  The wait staff are \"spot on\" professional, helpful, friendly, and very good at what they do.  They walk with confidence taking orders without note pads and making not a single mistake.  Three \"chef\" specials each evening, throw a dart at them as you can't go wrong.  Same with the menu, they will nail anything your order.  The Gnochi is just crazy good.  Veal piccata?  No problem.... perfection!  The food is over the top outstanding.  You'll leave full and happy.  And the owner is there to meet and greet you.  Nice touch!!  Bon Appetit !!",

The gnocchi were absolutely the star of the plate---light and airy, so delicate they melt in your mouth. My husband had the surf and turf special, which had generous portions and was cooked very well; he says he couldn't get it in his face fast enough. We shared a desert trio of cannoli (crisp, sweet not cloying), tiramisu (flavorful and light), and the chocolate mousse cake (rich and decadent) along with robust, full-bodied coffee. The staff was pleasant, prompt and personable without being intrusive, old school professional! The decor is a bit dated, but the music selections of Louis Prima, Keenly Smith,  and Tony Bennett set the mood perfectly.",

Our server was kind (the whole putting the napkin on your lap sort of thing), but he never once engaged in conversation with us and disappeared for at least 10 minutes at a time.  Beware of ordering the Bruschetta if you do not like olives.  They put olives on it, but do not list it on the menu that they do so. Yuck!    It took so long to get any service that we couldn't even order more than one drink the whole evening.  When they give you bread, you should get at least four pieces to split between two people, not three.  The \"wine's by the glass\" selection was great!  I got the Tuscany Chianti and loved it.  Too bad our server was a ghost to allow me to order more than one glass. Fresh, crisp and flavorful caesar salad.  The lasanga (we split) was at least $5 over-priced; very little meat and barely warm to the touch.  I felt some tension arise when we showed him our Groupon.  I think he made a lot of assumptions about our appearance (look very young) thinking we wouldn't give him a decent tip.  Well, he was right, but not for that reason.  He got a tip, but small because the service was so bad.   Will not go back again.",

    "text": "The first thing that comes to my mind when I walked in was a scene from Scarface. I expected to see Al Pacino sitting waiting for me, but instead I was greeted  by a very nice waiter and then introduced to Angelo. Angelo gave a heartily Italian greeting to my friend and I while he sat us. He alone is a reason to go to this gem of a restaurant.    We started off by ordering Escargots De Bygone the garlic butter and brandy wine combination was just right. This was my first time having escargots, and I really enjoyed it. Avanti has set the bar high for others.   For our main entrees we both ordered a pasta special which included Gnocchi in a white sauce, Penne Pasta in a red sauce, and Two huge Ravioli's with spinach. Each was delicious in it's own way, being savory, and rich without being overpowering.   We then were treated to a fish, I can't recall the name that was Parmesan crusted with a delicious sauce that was just right. The tenderness of the fish combined with just the right amount of richness from the sauce created a crescendo of flavors that was perfection.   Last but not least we had a desert platter with three delicious deserts, a mango, ice cream sorbet that was amazing, tiramisu which was equally good, and a classic Italian desert I can't recall. It reminded me of lemon bars my mother used to make for my sister and I as a child.   Overall this experience was amazing. I'm still thinking about it and telling my friends. The atmosphere, ambiance, and intimate setting along with outstanding food and service makes this a must see and eat place in my opinion. So many restaurants these days are about group dining, and group experiences, this is a lovely escape from all of that. When you just want an outstanding meal, friends, and good conversation.",

Reasonably priced as well.",

Nothing exciting. The cheese was scarce and didn't hold it together. Ours was served with the off-the-shelf powdered Parmesan. Seriously? powdered Parmesan? We also had the Cesar salad. Again, very plain, just romaine lettuce with croutons and dressing that tasted like it came from a bottle. Nothing fresh. We also had the Tiramisu. Again it was nothing but bland, the lady fingers tasted like they were soaked in water. There was no 'structure' to it. Just a bunch of mush. I will never dine here again. .",

    "text": "Maybe it was because I went on an off night (Tuesday night). Maybe it was because I was there for a company dinner with about 20 people (although the restaurant was empty). Maybe it was because I spent the last three weeks on a whirlwind tour of New York, Philadelphia, and Asheville, NC.  In any case, aside from the service, which was very good, I was deeply unimpressed with the food here. We started off with a plate of gnocchi in an Alfredo sauce and an appetizer of calamari. The gnocchi was completely drenched in Alfredo sauce, which is reminiscent of restaurants that try to hide the quality of their food with excessive sauce, e.g., The Olive Garden. The calamari was a bit rubbery, but otherwise average for a 2-3 star restaurant.  Onto the main course, I opted for the Ossobucco Milanese ($33). Again, this dish was completely covered in sauce. Aside from the bone, I wouldn't have been able to tell what I was eating. The risotto was overcooked, and there was a hint of a taste of dishwater so it was probably diluted to keep it from burning on the stove.  Again, the service was very good. And their bread was probably the best part of the meal. Maybe this place did serve good Italian food at one time, but the oversaucing of the food just killed it for me. For $33, I would like to taste the quality and flavor of the meat. If I wanted to eat gravy, I'd go to Grandy's. And don't get me started on the decor. Wow. Just wow. Think mirrors.  My suggestion would be to skip this place and head over to BLT Steak for their escargot appetizer ($7) during happy hour and then to Beckett's Table for the Pork Osso Bucco Confit ($18). And if you want a cleaner taste, try 5th & Wine. Either way, you'd be spending about $10-$15 less money for much better food and atmosphere.",

The problem with my experience was our server Andrew. We were celebrating my dads 81st bday and were  hoping our server would be a little more personable and knowledgable about the menu and better describing it than his vague half answers. His sarcastic demeanor and lack of enthusiasm to have customers was surprising and unexpected since the place was pretty vacant for a Friday night. I'd say perk up the staff a little and sir a senora don't really qualify in my book especially when he never even took the time to introduce himself. None the less a great meal and we will still go back when we get a need for some seriously hearty food :)",

It is sub-par, old school (cough-cough) Italian out of the 60's. Most places would have given a Mimosa with brunch or even a rose to mom. Not here. There was a large display of some stuff they called food, but it was gross. Believe me, folks, this is not Italian but some semblance of what they called Italian. I am ashamed for them.   As others suggested, the pasta was mush; there were breakfast buns on the dessert table, grizzled lamb, and butter knives for cutting meat, which could not cut through the ham! Someone mentioned the desserts were probably bought at Costo. I felt the same. This was all for the price of around $40 per person. Ugh!   Did I mention the over-priced, watered down drinks? No real Italian would ever put cheddar cheese on an antipasto. Did I mention our food plates were piling up on our table, but no one came to take them away? Service was lacking for a place that didn't have to worry about serving food for the day.   Every item at the buffet table should have had a serving utensil but many had none. I was very uncomfortable having to pick with my hands. It was all poor quality food and poorly prepared. Not for foodies and especially not for real Italians!",

Avanti is one of those places. Our server Sergio was unlike many waiters you see today. Not only was the service exceptional, but his knowledge of the food the wine etc. was stellar. We started off with the fried calamari which is some of the best we've ever had. The salads were fresh crisp in the dressing was delicious. Our table had Seabass which was light with the most delicious vegetables to accompany it. Another person in our party had the meat lasagna would you describe is the best he has ever had. I had the chicken Parmesan which was enough for two people and brought half of it home. Delicious. Try the desserts which will not disappoint. The chocolate mousse cake is out of this world and the tiaramasu is light, delicious and was gone in two seconds. Now let's get real, this is not a place you would go every week, however the prices are reasonable for the service, exceptional food and atmosphere. A great place for a special occasion.

When we sat down, the plates in front of us were taken away, and then they gave us bread ... without any plates (and without telling us it's garlic bread so you don't need butter or anything).  We were confused, though the bread was delicious.  The appetizer we got (which was a sampler with 3 pastas) was lukewarm.  Not bad enough to send back, but nothing to rave about.  My girlfriend's entree was incorrectly made, but the server fixed this quickly and brought us a free dessert as well.  Both entrees were fine.  Again, nothing to rave about.

The atmosphere is somewhat traditional, and business-like. You'd think you were in a scene in the Godfather.   But that's not what made it great.  The food was exquisite. From the perfect Italian breads, already brushed with olive oil, to the fluffy pasta crepe and nuanced sauce of the cannelloni, it was superb.  But that's not what made it great.  The wine list was thorough, but I just had the house red, which was a nice Chianti.  But that's not what made it great.  The cannoli. Don't leave this cannoli. OMG. I am a huge fan of a proper cannoli. By proper, I mean the filling should not be chalky. It should definitely not be custard. It really shouldn't be ricotta, but it's a cheaper cheese. The PROPER cheese should be mascarpone. The waiter promised it was, and every bit as good as what grandma used to make.  It was. I wanted to cry, it was so good. The filling was perfect - no chalkiness, no grit, no dryness. The shell was also perfectly cooked, just the right thickness and crispiness. It was like an out-of-body experience.  Go here at least for the cannoli. Stay for the dinner too. Fantastic place, and I'd wager the best Italian in the southwestern United States.",

    "text": "We returned recently and tried their pasta course prix fixe meal.  It was supposedly 5 courses (I was thinking tasting menu like, not expecting huge portions), but they served it as 3 courses (salad, main, dessert) and the pasta was obviously premade and just glopped on the plate, one big spoonfool to each corner.  The only pasta that rose to the \"good\" level was the gnocchi.  One tasted like vegetable stroganoff and was just nasty.  Ceasar salad had way too much dressing and tasted pre-made (kind of limp and drowning), the pasta as a whole frankly tasted like crap, and the dessert could have fit on a tablespoon.  Furthermore, our server seemed rude since we weren't dropping $150 on dinner.  We made no complaints as it seemed like one of those heavy handed places where the blame would clearly be placed on the patron, so we didn't bother.  Just smiled weakly and paid the bill.  It was a big two star step down from our first experience, where I was probably generous as it was with 4 stars.    Frankly, I'll take my business elsewhere with the many amazing Italian restaurants around the valley.  Leave this restaurant to the Assisted Living crowd that spare no expense for frankly mediocre food.  However, IF you have to go here (coupon, invited by another, etc.), stick to the following:  Order the parmesan encrusted fish (you can't go really wrong with that), and if you want a pasta course, stick to the gnocchi.  And pass on dessert and salad course unless you like a ton of dressing.",

    "text": "I've been to Avanti many times over many, many years.  I'm a picky eater so if I find one menu item at a restaurant that's a win !  But the menu at Avanti is so diverse ( pasta, fish, beef, pork...) there are too many great choices. Tonight we were celebrating Mom's birthday. I had spaghetti and meatballs. Mom had the tri pasta appetizer ( always delish) with a swordfish entree.  My brother had a combo plate combining veal parmigiana and pappardelle with beef ragu. Dad had osso bucco with fettuccine Alfredo.  Everything was so delicious. The service was attentive and customized. Our server created a special plate for my brother combining two entrees 1/2 and 1/2.  I highly recommend this Phoenix gem.",
