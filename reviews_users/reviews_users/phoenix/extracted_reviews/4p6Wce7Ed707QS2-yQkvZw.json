The restaurant itself is really cool, and I liked the overall design layout, but service was mediocre and the salad I paid a million dollars for was small and not thrilling.   I'd like to go back for drinks and apps and see how it goes.",

I ordered the steak firebread - she asked how I wanted it cooked - I said Med-rare. It came out medium but was still delicious. I love that they make their bread in house! My friend ordered the green chili mac with chicken, it was amazing. It always bothers me when servers don't do two minute check backs after they drop off our food to see if we need anything. I was out of water and luckily the hostess walked by to take care of us. Also our food took way too long especially for lunch. We will be back for the food and give them an opportunity to step up their service.",

My personal faves are the homemade potato chips with dip (always a hit!) and the Calamari Salad. The Calamari was always my \"go-to\" dish, but the last 2 times I've ordered it I've been disappointed.  I've been told about kitchen staff changes and recipe changes, but I feel like they took a great recipe and ruined it.  I still love the location, staff and ambiance, so I'll just find new dishes to order. I've had their mushroom pizza and a few of their other dishes. All good. Hopefully no more recipe changes in the future.",

We each had a drink- I had their mule, which was very tasty and served ice cold in a copper cup and my friend had the blueberry lemonade drink- this was so good! We also shared the short rib tacos and the calamari. The short rib tacos were fantastic! The meat was tender and it was loaded with veg giving it a very fresh taste. The salsa had just the right amount of heat. The portion size was huge (5 tacos), not only for happy hour, but for anytime. It was a great deal for 5.56$. The calamari was also good, but not nearly as good as the tacos. The calamari was fried and tossed with vegetables in a Thai peanut sauce of sorts. It was tasty, but I don't think I would get it again. Despite this, I will definitely be back for happy hour!",

Whether its the pulled pork sandwich (for which they have no problem giving extra sides of bbq sauce), the steak salad or tender short ribs, I have a seriously hard time not reordering the same things over and over.  Every visit here I've tried something different and have yet to be disappointed.    BTW, the housemade chips are light and crispy and go great with a dark and stormy or moscow mule.    Aside from the food, the service has always been accommodating.  On one visit, we had barely 30 minutes to eat and drink in order to make a flight.  Everything was rushed to our table asap (despite the restaurant being full) and as they were ready.  We were in and out with time to spare.    I can't wait for my next visit and to try something new.",

This doesn't mean this place is any lesser - it just mean this place might have to step it up to maintin the excellence that it wants to uphold.  I came here as a mingler (is that a word?) and for that purpose the space is far from optimal. Then add a musician that is ok, but way too loud for the space.. which made it incredibly hard to maintain a conversation. Music at this time is background, not the main event.   Service was awesome though.. a couple of waiters served a group of people that was moving about, and still got every order (to my knowleedge) right - thats impressive. I had some house rum drink that didn't exactly knock my socks off, but then again I consider myself a bit of a rum cognoscente and after that drink I switched to a more low key drink.  I would go back, but maybe not for Happy Hour.. but then again, they might work on it. The atmosphere is nice enough though.",

I came here for a work lunch and the place was on the quieter side, so that's good. I ordered the veggie sandwich ($12.56) and it was just a bad grilled cheese. The chipotle aioli didn't taste very good (and I like chipotle cream sauces) and there was so much of it that the sandwich bread slid around. The cheese wasn't very good. The vegetables in it were fine but nothing too exciting. The person I was eating with got the steak salad and I thought the salad size was...small. Too small to make a lunch of.  Overall, I think it's just a little too expensive for what you get especially since there are so many great restaurants that are also pricey but have yummier food for me in the area. But the restaurant area is nice and it probably would be fun for happy hour.",

The free parking across 56th Street is a nice addition.   As is the new menu.    We've gone for dinner with the kids in the late Spring, 2011- I had the burger and it was big and delicious.  My daughters giggled with delight when they saw their kid's spaghetti plate- three separate small bowls on a long, narrow platter.  One bowl had noodles, one had the 'sauce on the side' and the other a fruit salad.  Great price at $6.  My husband opted for the Ahi dinner- that was the bummer choice of the evening.  The ahi tuna steak lacked the flavor and texture I expect at $21 a plate.  It was cooked rare, so that wasn't the issue- just cut and quality of the fish.  The wine selection is ok, but the waiter didn't really know the nuances  between the wine by the glass, yet.    The patio is lovely and nice to see neighbors we know.  Since it is a neighborhood restaurant, it would be nice to be welcomed by the owners or management from time to time.  UPDATE:  I returned for lunch with a girlfriend in May, 2011.  The owner spent quite a bit of time chatting with us and explaining menu choices, their remodel, etc.  She was trained by their general manager and is the day manager.  Nice touch!",

The menu seemed interesting but we were both disappointed in our food. The soup and the meals both lacked any flavor. The salad dressing was the most flavorful thing on the plate. I had a nice chunk of some black plastic in my chicken salad wrap. I was done eating after discovering that. The server never came to check on us after taking our order until he came to pick up the plates. Upon letting him know about the plastic he just said oh, do you want something else? ... well i might have.... 20 minutes ago. then we waited another 10 minutes for our check and the manager to come over and explain that my entree had been removed from the check.  I would hope so. I don't think we'll be returning. Typically food can save poor service but neither were impressive.",

    "text": "So, my husband and I went to kitchen 56 for our anniversary on monday night around 6pm or so. We were immediately impressed with the ambience when we walked in, although we opted to dine on the large outdoor patio out back. Because I did my research before hand, I already knew that I wanted to try the cucumber basil lemonade and it didn't disappoint! We decided on the drunken bread a our appetizer, a recommendation from the very friendly and attentive waiter. I cannot remember his name for the life of me, but if you see a man with strawberry blonde hair, ask to sit at one of his tables. My husband knew what he was going to order before we arrived so he only took a quick glance at the menu before he quickly devoured the majority of the deliciously cheesy and herbaceous bread. As for myself, I usually have trouble deciding what I want, and when I asked the waiter what he recommended, he told me that one of, the dishes I was debating on was actually his favorite, so I ordered the papardelle with slow roasted pork sauce. The homemade pasta was tender and fresh and the herbed ricotta added a nice creaminess to the dish. The meat was also very tender and flavorful. I don't eat much meat so towards the end of my meal, I found myself fishing around for more of the noodles. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his meal, the steak was juicy and fork tender, and the chimichuri was delicious! Once we were finished, our waiter promptly cleared our plates and brought the check. It was what we expected to pay to eat out in this part of town, but for what it was, it was on the pricey side for sure. I think on my next visit, I'll stick to cocktails and appetizers by the firepit with some good friends. :-)",

The menu is fairly extensive with salads, burgers, pizza and a kids menu (which is very important to me).  They also have a nice wine selection.  The prices were reasonable.    I tried the Arcadia Pizza which had goat cheese, bacon, scallions, garlic and leeks.  It was very good.  My son's chicken fingers and fries were also tasty.    The food took awhile to come out but our server was trying hard to appease us despite the slow kitchen.   Overall, we were happy and will be back again soon.",

From the outside it doesn't look like much and generally once inside it also is less than impressive.  As we only had time for a drink we asked for a menu to check out what they had to offer.  The menu was a very pleasant surprise with dishes one would never expect to find based on the area, outside look of the place and the inside atmosphere.  We decided to come back later, that was a couple of months ago and we've been back many times since and have introduced our friends to the excellent food at this establishment.  The staff is well versed on the menu, is helpful but not pushy.  The wine list is very good and the food is outstanding.  Don't judge this book by the cover.  We go back often, finding that each new dish is a good at the last if not better!",

Our party ordered the pulled pork sandwich, burger deluxe, and the arugula and fennel salad, all excellent and prepared to perfection. HAD to order the brussel sprout hash, as I love brussel sprouts, and figured it would either be very bad or very good...delightfully, it was the latter! Fresh and savory, a perfect side. For desert we order several to sample, creme brulee with fig reduction, deep fried banana split (was that homemade ice cream?) and made to order zeppoles with sugar and cinnamon. Phenomenal. Start to finish it was a great night. David was our server and he was fabulous, I'm a stickler for good service, it can make or break a restaurant for me, and he was impressive. I will absolutely be back, can't believe it has taken me so long to make it in!",

We all had never been to Kitchen 56, so we thought we give it a go. When we arrived, the place was dead. However, the waitress and bartender were both ignoring us and it took about 20 minutes to get drinks. I was stoked that they served pbr in the can. The lunch menu looked amazing and we all got something different. I ordered the chorizo burrito which was tasty and not too greasy and the beau ordered the pulled pork which was delicious minus the generic bun. Our friends said their food was excellent but the service was slow and in an almost dead restaurant that is unacceptable. Our waitress came back about 30 minutes after our food arrived and we were all through our beers and would've ordered more if there hadn't been such a long delay but at that point we just wanted to get on with our day. Next time, we'll just order take out and skip the poor service.",

We called ahead and asked made a reservation and they gave us some push back at first, understandable because it was a Saturday night, but when we got arrived, there may have been only two other parties in the restaurant (other then the bar). We were greeted right away and they we waited about 5-7 minutes to be seated. Once again, the place was empty. Once seated we ordered and everything was relatively smooth. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer and if it had a rating alone it would be a 1 star. Perhaps the worst I've had in the phx-Scottsdale-West coast area. 45min-1hr later we finally got our food. This is where the 3 star comes in. The pulled pork sandwich was great. Can't complain one bit about other than I wish I would have ordered two of them. After finishing our meals, we yet again waited an eternity to get the bill. Needless to say, we probably won't be running back to this place anytime soon.",

The wings didn't taste very garlic cilantro wings tasted more like plain hot wings. The calamari was good, but the slaw flavors seemed to overpower the calamari. The pulled pork was tasty.

I'm not much of a drinker, so I can't speak to the quality of their martinis, but you can see the effort that went into their drink menu.   I did have a bit of a problem with my food order. A hamburger, ordered medium as was encouraged by the waitress, was actually raw in the middle. It received some extra grill time and was returned to the table with the comment, \"next time I'll remind you to order medium well.\" It was raw in the center! No great apology was needed, but it was the kitchen's error, not the diner's. The rest of our food was quite good.  Still four stars you say, even after being served a raw burger? Yes, a reflection of how much I liked the ambiance of Kitchen 56.",

I think the interior is terrible and nondescript.    Our martinis were over priced and served tepid. We had expressly asked for them to be ice cold and our server acted as if she knew what we meant. The bartender obviously doesn't drink martinis. Never order a mixed drink in a family restaurant!!!!!  The hamburgers were fine but nothing special. The French fries were the best part of the meal.

Was told they had a 20 minute wait for the patio.  Arrived, no parking, you MUST valet.  So we did.  Went inside, and it was nuts!  Very popular place!  Was then told an hour and half wait.  \"what happened to a 20 minute wait?\"  The hostess laughed and said, \"who told you that?\"  I told her the guy's name who answered the phone.  She apologized.  So we picked up our valeted car.  Went on Yelp, saw Kitchen 56 just down the road, also dog friendly.  Called ahead, said they would hold a table for us.  Arrived, plenty of parking, and a much nicer place from the outside!  Went inside, we were greeted and sat quickly on a beautiful, and clean patio.  The server could not have been nicer, and was eager to help us out with our time constraint to get to the airport.  She immediately brought out a cold water bowl for our pooch!  We hadn't even asked!  Our food was delicious and arrived quickly! And she was very prompt with our check as well, knowing we had to eat and run!  We will be back on our next trip up!  It's a lovely place, clean, and very nice atmosphere!  Did I  mention \"Dog Friendly!\"",

Windows rolled down, we smelled the a barbecue grill and saw one of the cutest little patios ever...so naturally we decided to ditch the day's plans and get a bite to eat. Fabulously enough, it happened to be happy hour- which they do everyday! We all got cocktails for $5.56 and plates for the same amount. Garlic cilantro wings are good, they come out crispy, hot and with a little flavor of the grill. Not really that spicy but really yummy. Huge portion for a little over five bucks. We also had short rib tacos, good but nothing super impressive. Drinks were killer though- back porch lemonade, pink panther and green tea. They seem nice and harmless but they do pack a little punch. The vibe on the patio is great and the soundtrack there is on point! Visit for happy hour, it's a great deal.",

Literally forever. We would go there every single weekend for the chilaquiles. Every weekend! We were so sad when they closed down for renovations. Let me tell you, these original chilaquiles were the absolute best food I've ever had in my entire life. Melt in your mouth. The green sauce, out of this world, and the potatoes, always seasoned to perfection. Well we get there and we are so excited, we get our \"go to chilaquiles\". I asked are they the same? The waiter's response: yes! Awesome! Well our meal finally comes to the table. The first thing we see, the three tortillas are all fully burned. Like black. We had to remove all of the edges. The cheese, different, laid on top, but it's not melted.... it's literally like they went in the fridge grabbed a piece of cheese and just threw it in top. Our eggs were both over hard ( I asked for over medium and my boyfriend asked for over easy). The green sauce is gone. It was just meat, and some pico sauce mixed together. Lastly, the potatoes which I was actually looking forward to, had absolutely no spices at all. Just grabbed out of the freezer and put in a pan. I'm just so sad. They didn't keep it the same. We broke our no carbs diet to come here, and it was not worth it . Please dear god bring back your original dish. No joke, it was the best food I've ever had. Why fix something that's not broken? Please! Please! Please! Bring it back!",

    "text": "The worst restaurant experience I've had in a long while... My husband and I went into Kitchen 56 on the recommendation of a friend. We went in later, around 7:45pm for a very hungry late dinner. We ordered the pretzel bites to start - they were mediocre at best. Main entrees were baked potato with pulled pork and NY Strip. When the food arrived my steak was cold to the touch and I didn't even cut into it - hoping they could just throw it back on the grill for a bit longer without it getting dry. As I waited the 10 minutes of so, my husband dug into his potato to find it was still a bit raw & hard in the center, and commented both the pork and potato were bland and not well-seasoned. My steak arrived for the 2nd time and I cut into the steak I quickly realized it was cooked mid-rare NOT the medium-well I had requested (and told the waitress twice since I know this preparation may not be the \"norm\" for a strip steak). I told the waitress and she had the manager sent over to the table, he offered to have a whole new plate cooked and a free dessert. So now I'm waited another 20 minutes, my husband is completely done with his food, I'm starving and guess what... the steak finally comes out cooked MEDIUM!! I was so frustrated, exhausted, and hungry at this point I just ate around the edges and quickly lost my appetite. The free cookie sundae was the ONLY redeeming thing about this place, but certainly not enough for us to ever return. And just for the cherry on the top - as we were paying a couple walked in and it was about 15 minutes before close - and get this - the manager actually refuse to seat them and them sent them away naming other nearby restaurants!! That action in and of itself really sparks to our overall experience for dinner that night...not worth our time!",

I had my husband try it, and it was very clearly beef. I didn't feel like complaining at the time, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm pretty bummed because I like coming here. Boo.",

I'd heard of the place but knew nothing about it, so before we met, I looked at their website and made a mental list of the things I wanted to try.  None disappointed!  First of all, the place is adorable.  It wasn't at all what I expected, but I loved what it ended up being.  From the outside, the place looked simple and welcoming.  Inside, it's open and casual, and decorated really nicely, from a large mural to fun wall decor.  Seating was available at the bar, tables, or booths by the windows.  Upon learning it was my first visit, the server assigned to my table was welcoming and enthusiastic and was quick to recommend drinks and menu items.  My first drink was one of their signature adult lemonades - the black cherry.  It was ridiculously delicious from first sip to the last few amarena cherries left in the bottom of the glass.  I could have easily enjoyed a few of these drinks, especially since they didn't taste like they had alcohol in them!  I had the pink panther next, and while I enjoyed it, it wasn't nearly as good as the first.  Since I was two drinks in, I decided a bit of food would be a good idea, so I tried the black bean dip with tortilla chips off the happy hour menu (it seems to have rotated off the menu, sadly!).  It was SO GOOD and I was disappointed when we finished it.  For dinner, I went with the griddled corn cakes topped with pulled pork.  This was the best thing I'd eaten in a long time!  It was served with two sauces, both of which perfectly complemented the flavors of the corn and pork.  Definitely my favorite.  There's nothing I didn't like about this place, except maybe that it wasn't closer to my home.  I look forward to visiting again and again!",

They happy replaced my meal with a margarita pizza which was ok at best. Overall the 2 stars are for the ambience. The service was fine, but the food was bad. Very disappointing.",

I ordered the BurgerDeluxe , yes I'm a huge burger snob, at any rate, I always judge a place by how they make or will make their burgers.  I ordered it Very Extra Rare...and Yes that IS exactly how it was served.  Our server said, and I quote, \"I told the chef that you indeed wanted it to only be introduced to the grill, not actually to date the grill\".  How Perfect Was That???  It was just perfect and I was giddy the entire meal.  The service was not over agressive, just attentive. The balance of the meal consisted of my dining partner had the pulled pork.  She liked it a lot and would go back!  The onion marmalade on my burger was extremely note worthy.  Just the right balance of sweet without losing the onion flavor!    So I say, Go Forth and Enjoy Kitchen 56.!.!.!...",

Especially with the quality of food.   The food was amazing.  I've been here 3 times and each time I tried something new.  Last time I had the burger and it was tasty.  I like the seasoning on the fries as well.  The first time I had the handmade parpardelle with slow roasted pork sauce (comfort food galore).    They've made the parking easy and I think it's perfect for a quick stop on the way home from work.    I can't wait till it cools off to sit in the lounge seats outside and play some ping-pong!",

Unless you go during happy hour, which I do hear is good, things are very overpriced.    The staff is friendly enough but the service was terrible. On one occasion our entire table had nearly finished our entrees before one member of our group had received his food.

The outside patio was fun and happy-looking and it, the homey woodsmoke smell, and the 'local' neon sign, drew us in.  The menu is full of delectable taste combos and we quickly decided in the prosciutto and fig pizza and brussel sprout hash. The server, Che, was very friendly and attentive and the food came quickly.   The pizza was very tasty,  although was more in a dessert line to my taste since its sauce is honey-based, which the menu does clearly state. Thr crust was light and airy with just the right crispness. The sprouts were also done nicely, with just a touch of crunch.  The two of us split the pizza and hash and we still had leftovers.   The other diners were a mix of young families and couples in their 40s. The price point was very reasonable, especially by Scottsdale standards. I would definitely come again if I was in the area and might even make a special trip.",

    "text": "Hit. And. Miss.  The restaurant looks pretty cool at first glance but upon entering, it felt very cold and uninviting.  Nothing on the menu jumped out at me but I thought I would give it a shot anyways.  Our server was really friendly and helpful and made some nice suggestions for dinner.  We tried the Garlic and Cilantro wings for an appetizer and my boyfriend ordered the handmade Pappardelle pasta and I the Arugula and Fennel salad with grilled chicken.  The wings came out quickly but when the food runner brought them out he placed them on the table and immediately turned around without asking if we needed anything else.  Um...plates would have been nice.  I would think if your only job is running food to tables, you would be aware that side plates are necessary when you bring wings to a table.  We waited several minutes until the server returned from the back with plates.    The wings tasted great, they were crispy with great flavor...until I bit all the way into them and noticed that they were way undercooked and still very pink.  Again, it took quite some time to even get the attention of anyone to alert them of the problem.  However, once we mentioned it, they quickly fired up a new order and brought them out, apologizing for the inconvenience.  I thought they handled the situation well (as the manager apologized and they comped two glasses of wine) so we brushed it off and enjoyed the new order of wings although they had overcompensated by practically burning the new order.  As for our entrees, we loved the Pappardelle pasta, it had great flavor and the slow roasted pork was amazing.  My salad, however, was probably the most boring, bland salad I have ever had.  It almost wasn't even worth eating.  I've had fennel in salads before and it normally adds a nice burst of flavor but the fennel was sliced so thinly that it added zero flavor and the sherry vinaigrette was equally as underwhelming.    Overall, a very hit and miss experience.  I think this place has potential but needs some work as far as their back of the house operations.  The food was not executed well and the food runner clearly needed some training as each time he ran food to our table, he forgot to ask one very basic yet important question, \"Can I bring you anything else?\"   Though we were not impressed, I still gave them 3 stars for the server and how they handled the wing situation.  I'm sure we will eventually give this place another shot once they have worked out some of the kinks.",

The pizza was wonderful, the mac and cheese needed a pit more seasoning, but was creamy and satisfying nonetheless. We had the sticky toffee cake for dessert. I bake, so I have high standards for dessert. This was a little lackluster. I'd skip dessert next time.   Overall, a pleasant experience, good service, nice atmosphere and a great wine selection.",

The food was great and the cocktails were awesome as we listened to great live music and enjoyed everything from the sun to the desserts.  The edamame is the best in the city, the wings, pulled pork on corn cakes and the pizzas were fantatic and the burger was juicy and flavorful.   Hoping to catch another game and afternoon session at Kitchen 56 during spring training and more until the summer comes.  Can't wait until my next visit because the steak frites are calling my name and I hope they are served with a side of ribs because I can't pick what's next on my stomachs list.  Happy chomping, ssw",

    "text": "Second visit. First time in was during happy hour. Ordered off the happy hour menu and was very pleased with the entire visit and I would have given 4 stars at that time. Today was a different story. Had to wait 10 minutes for a table, ok if busy, but restaraunt was basically empty, but was told we had to wait to see if people who made reservations would show up. Finally seated and were given water by a waitress who was over the top perky. I appreciate upbeat people, but dont talk to me like I am a child at the doctors office, you come off as fake and irritating. Two of the water glasses had black stuff at the bottom. Showed to waitress she commented that it was probably fruit flies. It looked like cracked black pepper or small bits of charcoal to me. Glasses were removed. Food was ordered and arrived in a short amount of time. Appetizers were ok, but the dipping sauce for both the pretzles and chips were  bland..Ordered a firebrand chicken sandwich, was told the the bread was a flatbread, their version of pita bread. Turned out that it was served on a pretzle bread/roll, which tasted ok, just not what was advertised. I had their black angus burger. Dissapointing to say the least. The smallest 1/3 pound burger I have ever seen. Small plain bun, two pickle chips, two limp red onion rings, no lettuce or tomato, and a petite amount of ketchup that was not enough for the burger, let alone the fries. Asked for more ketchup and mustard, another petite portion arrived. I am a big boy, I can handle a ketchup bottle, I promise not to waste or make a mess. The flavor of the burger was the dealbreaker. It had a intense chemical taste, at first I thought a gas grill flavor, but the more I ate the more it tasted like charcoal lighter fluid.I did not finish.  I have no problem paying top dollar for my food, but I expect to get what I pay for. (see Becketts Table) I will be back for half price happy hour food , but will likely not be ordering off the full price menu again",

The menu is simple but varied.  The mac & cheese was tempting, also the cinnamon roll sounded delightful.  In the end we tried the 10 oz burger and pulled pork sandwich.  Burger was 2 patties, cooked to perfection with cheese and all the fixings, served w/ fries and coleslaw.  Coleslaw didn't quite get it, dressed was somewhat bland.  The pulled pork was excellent, perfectly seasoned sauce and topped with onion straws.  I chose the green salad option rather than fries.  The salad was just a lettuce combo but the dressing was a light homemade vinegarette, simply perfect.  Maybe my favorite find was the iced tea - freshly brewed, slightly fruity w/ rosehips and other delights, really REALLY good - no sweetener required.  I like the vibe of this place, slightly hip and very comfortable.  Nice background music, bright and cheery w/ natural lighting.  Also outdoor patio area looks fun for cooler days.  The service was outstanding.  I can't wait to come back and try happy hour or maybe dinner.",

Totally bummed we decided to go down the street and try Kitchen 56. Let's just say when we left, we all agreed we were glad that the restaurant we were going to go to was closed. Kitchen 56 rocks!! First off I love the ambiance and decor, our waiter was friendly, funny and very knowledgeable about the menu and drinks! I tried his recommendation of the Pink Panther Lemonade and it was amazing with fresh blueberries! One of the other ladies had white wine and was thoroughly impressed. We were even lucky enough to hit happy hour prices!   We ordered 3 dishes to share... homemade potato chips with a parmesan-onion dip...amazing!! Steak and spinach salad - the dressing was light and tasty and the pieces of steak were incredible! No fat whatsoever and quite a few pieces! Then we got the Acadia Wood Fired Pizza! And it was amazing!! Afterwards, we got the chocolate chip cookie topped with ice cream, can we say yummy!! the cookie was warm and gooey and tasted great with the ice cream. I totally recommend this place! The prices are moderate and the food and service is great!!!",

I ordered the barbecued pulled pork sandwich with onion strings. Onion strings on the sandwich were cold-ish, weird. The pork itself was very bland, and the barbecue sauce was nothing to write home about (I can't explain the reviewer love I see on the postings next to mine). My colleagues seemed to like their meals o.k., but no one was talking about their meals or sharing what they got, so that speaks volumes.  This place might be worth a shot with a better chef/cook or better recipes. Looks good on paper, but I can't recommend it. Too many good options nearby to make this a go-to place.",

For dinner I had the Arcadia Pie cuz I love me some goat cheese and bacon. It was tasty but there wasn't a sauce on the pizza and I kinda wished it had a drizzle of an herbed olive oil or something cuz it was just a lil dry. The boyfriend loved the pork tenderloin saying it was spiced perfectly. Another at our table had the tofu dish which she described as the best tofu she's ever had (she apparently had been here earlier in the week and had the same dish then too.)  The pulled pork sandwich across the table from me looked pretty tasty too, but didn't get the raving review the others did.  They have some really interesting sounding cocktails on their menu... Maple Manhattan anyone? Their wine list is extensive and fairly priced as well. They have a giant cinnamon roll on their wknd breakfast menu that I would love to tackle along with a latte sometime soon!",

I believe that there was only 1 server taking all the orders for our group of 10, which did not seem to scream \"good planning.\" But, our server kept her cool and didn't show her frustration when one of my party pulled the \"high maintenance\" card out and requested several variations to her lunch selection. Kudos to you, cool headed server!   My veggie sandwich was ok. It didn't have a lot of flavor. The veggies were fresh enough, but the overall impression was rather bland. The fries, though, were great. My colleagues appeared to enjoy their selections, so perhaps only the veggie sandwich needed a flavor boost.

I am not a fan of portion sizes that are so big that half the food is either thrown away and wasted or is unhealthy for an average sized adult, but the $13.56 \"side salad\" sized Beet Salad almost seemed insulting.   They could have at least bulked it up with more greens, but this salad had almost no bulk whatsoever.  My husband was completely finished with his salad before I had even finished half of my $9.56 chilaquiles, which was not a huge portion either, but was plenty.    I'll come back again and try something else, and might have to just speak up if I'm served a child sized meal again.",

The large dog friendly patio opens to a super huge service window that services the bar. The place is bigger on the inside than it appears from the outside. Patrons mostly 30 something's and up. Lots white collars on weekdays and a good mix on weekends.   Food: Great selection of salads and sandwiches, all well prepared with quality touches but wouldn't go so far as to call it a artisan sandwiches. I had the Caesar salad and Turkey cranberry sandwich both were great! Appreciated the focaccia bread and havarti cheese. Generous portions. Impressive beer/cocktail list as well.  Price: At 13 dollars a sandwich I thought it was a bit steep but perhaps it's par for course for the area, not sure as I don't frequent this part of town.  Service: I ate at the bar, was well attended to. Food served promptly.  Overall: I can see this place as a great spot for a business lunch and cocktail during the week or bring the dog and some friends for a weekend lunch and beer.",

Definitely grab the green chili mac-n-cheese if you come!",

The restaurant appears to be remodeled and had a a small booth section(which we sat at) an open space with tables n chairs and a small outside patio . The host was very friendly and seated us promptly . I ordered a steak sandwich and my wife had a chicken sandwich which  the waitress said was a off the menu item . I fond both sandwiches delicious and I was surprised at the price for the bottled beer which I thought was very well priced . The food was great the service was great and the only reason for the 4out 5 rating was perhaps the menu itself could have had more selection . But overall the choice to stop and eat at kitchen 56 was win",

    "text": "It actually pains me to rewrite this review because K56 was one of our favorite go-to spots in the area. We anxiously awaited their reopen and it was my first meal after being out of the country for nearly 3 weeks. Only to find out the re-do unfortunately seems to have not worked in our favor. Don't get me wrong, aesthetically the restaurant looks great. They did a good job of updating the decor and design. And while it's much smaller, it's still very pleasing to the eye. Our experience started with a very awkward introduction. We stood at the front for nearly 5 minutes waiting to be seated, we were acknowledged by three different people, but nobody offered to seat us. Until finally a gentleman asked if we had been helped yet, and when we said no, he said he would be back shortly. After we were sat, we sat a good 5-7 minutes until our initial intro with our server. Again, not the end of the world, but a little unusual for typical Kitchen 56 standards that we have experienced in the past! I was sad to see they got rid of the green chile mac and cheese dish! That was a personal favorite. So, We started with the warm spinach salad. It was good, we were pleased with the order. My boyfriend ordered the pork chop, and I ordered the stuffed chicken. The pork chop was one of our favorite dishes on the old menu, one because of flavor, but also because of the generous portion sizing. They have downsized the portion, yet the price remains the same. And his was overdone, even after ordering it medium. The stuffed chicken was just disappointing. It was dry, and overdone with very little to talk about. I was also surprised that for a $20 dish, it did not come with a starch of any kind. Definitely not a reorder, or money well spent in my opinion. Maybe it was just an off night, as we have had consistent positive experiences in the past! But, after two average entrees and a $70 check, this may just be a happy hour stop in spot, and not a date night spot like it was for us for the past few years.",

    "text": "I Guess You Have To Like Their Chili Rub. Me, Not So Much...  I stopped in for Brunch when I spotted Kitchen 56 on a Saturday around 10:45 am. I had no idea what to expect, but entered with an open mind.  There weren't very many brunch items, but several of their lunch items were listed on the brunch menu. None of them appealed to me, so I decided to keep it basic.   When I asked my server about the Kitchen 56 Scramble of the day, she indicated that the chef's scramble ingredients of the day were bacon (got my attention), mushrooms, and pepper jack cheese. She indicated that the scramble was then served on a bed of crisp O'Brien potatoes with peppers and onions. That sounded like a good choice, so I selected it, and settled in to wait.  Looking around, I found the decor very pleasant and inviting. Although I wasn't drinking that early, the drink menu looked really interesting. They had specials on Bloody Marys, Mimosas, and Grapefruit Mint Bellini's. I tucked that information away for the future.  My food arrived quickly, and was very hot. The portion was generous, and I could tell it was far more than I could manage to eat. The scramble was tasty, although I didn't understand the addition of thinly sliced potatoes to the scramble, when it was served on a bed of O'Brien potatoes. The O'Brien potatoes, unfortunately, were a bit salty, and had was flavored with a seasoning that I didn't like at all with the scramble. I had to leave the potatoes alone as they were ruining my scramble, and in fact, caused me to stop eating all together.   When my server cane around, and I asked her what the seasoning was, she indicated that the potatoes were seasoned with their \"Kitchen 56 Chili rub\". As soon as she said Chili, I could peg the taste. When I indicated my dislike of it, she did offer to bring me some more potatoes with none of the seasoning, but by then the flavor had gotten into the scramble and ruined my experience.  Service was good, the environment was pleasant, the prices were a touch on the high side, but overall it seems like a nice place. Unfortunately, I think that they rely on their chili rub in a number of their dishes. Since I don't like it, I don't think I will be returning.",

Its off Indian School and 56th Street At Kitchen 56  You make me so hungry baby I get so hungry I get so hungry I could die  And although it's always crowded, You still can find some room. Where very hungry foodies Do write away their review  You make me so hungry baby I get so hungry I get so hungry I could die  Kitchen 56 is located at the border of Arcadia and S. Scottsdale.  It has a vintage full service gas station ambient with a modern twist.  Who knew this would work so well!  I attended on a Sunday evening for the all day HH on drinks and live music was a rocking!  It was a lazy Sunday so I ordered me a PBR, yep....yep....yep.  For only $2 a can man that's some cheap fass beer!  Though not much taste I can still appreciate me some PBR and how long it has survived the test of time.  For my entree I ordered their Black Angus burger with fries.  Needless to say, and to my surprise.  It was one damn good fass burger!  Cooked medium and oozing American cheese all over with the fresh crunch of the onions and pickles gave this delectable burger between some butter bread and awesome POW to my palates!  Yummy!  I don't recall talking much that night.    Service was awesome our waiter was quite knowledgeable about the menu plus his recommendations were definitely appreciated.  Can't wait to go back and another round and neither should you! - Enjoy!",

Yelp lists 3 starts as \"A-OK,\" and I think that's an accurate description of our meal here.  We were lucky enough to snag the very last spot in their parking lot (it's a little small) and moseyed in for an early dinner. Very Important Things First: They have my favorite wine of all time on their list! Rockus Bockus! For inquring minds, it's a DELICIOUS juicy red blend and the only other restaurant I've found it is the Grassroots in Scottsdale. Seek it out and love.  After looking over the menu, we realized any options of eating healthy were off the table. We started with the pretzel dippers and cheese dip, which was a TREAT. My husband had the green chili burger that came with some amazing skin-on fries, and I decided to keep blowing it out with the skillet chicken pot pie. The crust was delicious; the filling was tasty but could have used a little more ZING.   Our server was very sweet and attentive. I do think, like others have pointed out, that the price points for this atmosphere and type of food are a little steep. Still, we walked out happy (stuffed). I would definitely come back for happy hour!",

Very comfortable, friendly staff, perfect noise level, and extremely accommodating!   All 5 of us ordered something different. Cheddar Mac and cheese was tasty. Baked potato was giant and came with more than enough toppings, including pulled pork. I heard the classic pizza was good, but I didn't try it bc my daughter added mushrooms (I am not a mushroom eater). The lemon chicken that looked good in front of another customer  proved itself very good for my entree (sans mushrooms). And my husband asked the chef to create a pizza with BBQ sauce (no tomato), fresh mozzarella, pulled pork and onion straws. It was delicious! Even our server commented on how good it looked!   The topper was when the server brought out a special birthday dessert for my daughter without singing! She loved it without being too embarrassed! We are in AZ only a few times a year, but we will definitely be eating at Kitchen 56 each time. We can't wait to dine outside there too. We highly recommend this restaurant!!",

I ordered the mac and cheese that came with a petit salad, my girlfriend ordered a tofu dish, and our friends ordered a steak special and a sandwich.  The steak which was ordered well (I know, I cringed, too) came out rare, the vinaigrette on my salad tasted rotten, the mac and cheese was middle of the road...I've had better and worse.  My girlfriend enjoyed her tofu and our friend said her sandwich was pretty good.  My green tea adult lemonade was fantastic!  The best part of my meal for sure!  When we ordered dessert I chose the creme brulee.  I sunk my spoon in and it just dripped off...ew!!! Creme brulee is supposed to be a custard-like consistency...it was definitely not set.

I would pick something diff next time. I opted for the Arcadia salad- mixed greens with cranberries and pecans with a citrus vinaigrette. I added chix for protein. It was very clean, fresh and exactly what I wanted. The menu is simple from pastas, pizzas, burgers, salads. i would go back and check it out again but wouldn't recc to drive here if you dint live in the neighborhood.",

I had the pulled pork but the flavor was too smoky for me. There isn't necessarily anything wrong with this place, but we won't be back.",

    "text": "I don't understand all these negative reviews.  First of all I like having a restaurant in this neighborhood within walking distance. Sure beats having an abandoned purple car garage. Normally I don't write a review for restaurants.  If I am happy with the food I go back, if not I don't return. I am not the type to want to hurt people's business because of my one experience. I feel like it shows a certain self importance to think that your one experience at a restaurant is typical of all experience.   Getting to the review. Each time I have eaten here my party and I have been very happy with the food and service. Today I went for lunch, which is something new they are offering.  I am happy they are offering lunch.  Prices are right in the ballpark for what you would expect at lunch at $8-$12 range.  The lunch plates come with fries or salad which to me wasn't obvious based on the online menu.  I had a turkey, egg, and cheese with fries.  I love egg sandwiches so I was happy to see it on the menu and it didn't disappoint. I had the fries which were good.  My partner had the veggie burger which they were happy with.  They really enjoyed the actual veggie patty which they could tell was homemade.     The restaurant was crowded and doing a good business which I was happy to see.  I was also happy to see they handled the lunch rush well with the service being great.  All in all an excellent experience and will definitely return.",

Id like to try the BBQ rib tacos next time. The entree did get kind of pricey, like 20 plus. I pray that they are not all show like the fish. The presentation looked very nice and classy.  ****update  I went for happy hour.  Drinks were excellent , lots of variety and only 5$ for their specialty drinks.  My friend ordered the Rib Tacos and was not impressed. She said there was barely any meat on them and what was there was fatty.",

On our visit today for lunch the one major change I noticed is the prices went up. More than what I think is fair.   We visited during the lunch hour and almost every thing was $12-$16. Most salads don't have a protein and the salad that I ordered had so little chicken it should be considered bacon bits. We also had Mac and Cheese $12 again for nothing memorable. Noodles and Cheese. Service was slow... I usually hope to have my food within 15-20 minutes for lunch service but it seemed to push the later end of the time frame.   We love the patio and the view of Camelback is great.   We may come back for a drink but we won't be eating here again anytime soon.  Oh and they had a fly problem. We had 2-3 circling our heads for the hour we were there.",

Kitchen 56 takes pride in it's food and it shows, not to mention the varied menu, there truly is something for everyone here (even our pickiest friends can find something they like).  We tried the Wood-Fired Pizza - they have six different wood fired pizzas to choose from so it was a very difficult choice. I had tried the Spicy Salami & Sausage with San Marzano Sauce, fresh Mozzarella, herbs and spiced oil previously which was great, amazing crust, super delish toppings but we decided to try a different pizza this time. The Arcadia Pie features goat cheese instead of a more traditional mozzarella, leeks (for you foodie types), scallions, garlic and bacon. Winner. Winner... yep, very tasty. Of course bacon on anything is a sure hit but it was a nice compliment to the goat cheese and leeks, I would definitely recommend trying this for a nice change from your traditional pizza.  Who can resist Onion Strings... not us! They call them Onion Straws here but by either name they are a treat! The batter was not to thick, nice and light and the dipping sauce is was a spicy remoulade, which was a perfect compliment and a big hit at the table. Food you can eat with your fingers is always welcome at our table, call us low maintenance!

    "text": "I'm willing to go ahead with 3 stars here, and since I will likely come back again, will gladly update this next time... but this is based on my initial impression from Valentine's Day dinner.    I was able to snag a table here on Valentine's day via <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopentable.com&s=897c359bd752b4f5407d5ea86453c82be2d1913c8d0b51b18d81fc58f52a6497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">opentable.com</a>. Unfortunately due to my partner being in the hospital the night prior, I had to wait till the last minute to make sure that we were even going to be able to go at all that night.  Gladly we were able to, and given the menu options, I was glad to find a place that we were both able to enjoy.  We arrived about 5 minutes before our scheduled reservation time, and were seated right away.  We were brought to a table on the outdoor patio, which I'm sure was lovely, however, due to my partner's breathing issues, we had to ask to be seated indoors instead.  The host gladly moved us to an indoor table right away, which was appreciated.  Although we were very appreciative that the restaurant let us know right away that there was a delay in the kitchen, we really weren't sure why that was, considering the restaurant wasn't all that crowded.  Given that however, while we did receive our appetizer fairly quickly, the chicken wings were under cooked, and in some cases, partially raw.  Once our entrees arrived, they were luke warm at best. At this point we had been there over an hour, and my partner was not feeling well, so we chose to eat and leave rather than send the food back to be heated up (which would probably have been done by microwave).   I did enjoy the menu, and we were very interested about their new brunch menu, however, My suggestion would definitely be to keep patrons posted throughout their time there.  Although we were told when we came in, we felt that no one really kept us posted about anything, and then to have luke warm food, makes me think that it was just sitting there for who-knows-how-long until it was finally picked up and brought to us.",

    "text": "Really great place overall. Been there for 3 years but just now visiting for the first time since my son has gymnastics at Little Devil around the corner. Love the building and decor. They have a B&W mural of the corner building when it used to be a gas station. The staff is superb. Even tho they didn't have any crayons, the hostest brought over a dry erase board with markers. The prices are a bit high but the quality of the food deserves it with a small exception.  5 stars from me is just an inch away...  - 1 Star for no changing table in either restroom. Luckily there is a bench in the women's restroom so I had to commandere it for a few minutes. They feature a child's menu so I think it's something for 56 to think about.  They do have booster seats and high chairs.  - 1 Star because my absolutely tasty ahi tuna salad had a few spoiled pieces of lettuce at the bottom. Leads me to speculate they either use prepackaged greens or they're not rotating stock properly.  Thank you 56. Hopefully the lettuce was an isolated incident. I'll be back.",

I went there with my boyfriend last Saturday, for both our first times, and we left so satisfied. We started by ordering a Pickle Back, which I highly recommend! It is a shot of Jameson with a shot of pickle juice to follow. Soo delicious! And to finish, you are given a nice cold PBR.   The food was great. We ordered the Parmesan Onion dip, with homemade chips! We split the pulled pork BBQ sandwich with a side of their Green Chili Mac and Cheese. Everything came out on time, and was delicious. Our server was so sweet, and it seemed like everyone else working there was as well.   I left and instantly recommended it to everyone who asked where we ate that night! Can't wait to go back.",

We had ordered appetizers and decided not to order dinner once we tried the potato skins and tacos.  We ordered one more app, the chicken tacos, and they we cold and flavorless as well. Our son was hungry, so we ordered the burger (medium well) and it came out just short of mooing.",

(Yes we had entertainment for the kids but there's only so much a kid can do)  We made reservations and they were all ready and eager to serve us. I felt bad for our server but she never apologized for the long delay. Also the bill was messed up.

They finally reopened a few days ago and I had the pleasure of checking them out during happy hour today.   It's a much smaller, location, completely different look and what seems to be a new staff. Granted I did not eat anything, and just had a drink. I really like the new vibe. It feels more intimate and something out of San Francisco. The staff was super friendly and almost pumped to be apart of the new kitchen 56. The bartender with the short platinum hair was really sweet and instantly made me feel like she's been serving me for years. From what I can tell they still have a great patio. Definitely smaller, which I like. I'm excited to come back and check out the food menu. Sometimes change is good. And that definitely seems to be the case here.",

Great looking space with nice decor and atmosphere! Right off 56th St & Indian School this is a prime Arcadia location. This part I hate having to talk about. The negatives of Kitchen 56, starting with the very limited dinner menu. Not a lot of options on the menu. I decided to keep it easy and try two of the choices available. The burger and pulled pork sandwich. Picking two of the less expensive items as a way to gauge this place. See If I would trust them with one of their more advanced dishes. The trust is just not there folks. The burger which was order medium well came out over well done and dry. No flavor, just the presence of a slightly burnt bun with cheese. Would not be fair to even consider this as an entry in any best burger competition. On to the pulled pork, this came out cold to taste. Literally the meat was cold on the bun which tells me it has been refrigerated. Even though I overheard one of the servers telling another guest they are a fresh kitchen. Nothing is prepared in advance all fresh. Bottom line is you'd be better off going to In & Out Burger or Dicky's BBQ. To be fair the French fries were delicious on both orders. I do appreciate how nice everyone was here though!",

She gave it the thumbs up.  My niece ordered the bowl of soup.  It had chicken and mushrooms.  She gave it the two thumbs up too.  I ordered the pork chop.  It was good.  It came with mashed potatoes and a assortment of veggies.  I gave it two thumbs up too.  We did have the pretzels with beer cheese as a appetizer too.  It was good.  I wish the size of the pretzels were a bit larger though.  It was good though.  I do not drink that much anymore.  Did enough for two lifetimes in my twenties.  They have a cool looking drink mixes on the wall too.  I will eventually try the pink panther drink.  I like this place it was our third time here.  It is a drive from where we live.  If we were closer this would be a once a week place.",

Happy hour tacos for 6 dollars, came with a surprising 4 tacos.  That's right not 2 or 3; but 4.    Definitely worth the stop and coming back for sure",

I met friends for drinks and apps, and we all loved our food and left with some in boxes. The appetizers portion sizes really could be a meal in themselves. Our original plan was to meet at another nearby restaurant but there was no parking- Kitchen 56 definitely has parking to spare. A good amount by the front, then a HUGE lot on the other side of the street.  Drinks were on the spendy side, but we knew we were paying for nice atmosphere, tasty unique drinks like the Green Tea \"Adult Lemonade\" with mashed up strawberries and mint. SO GOOD.  Our waiter was attentive and very friendly, and the manager even came out and visited with us for awhile.   Overall, this is a great place to meet friends and be able to talk and not compete with loud music or a noisy street. Thumbs up!",

And there she was Sara who by the way had a Large White watch (inside joke). She was as business and friendly as the first time.    The hostess sat us at a table for 4 people and this family came in and they looked like they really wanted to have dinner at the Kitchen 56 and I felt they Katy and I did not need a table for 4 so as they were leaving I stood up and flagged them to stay and gave up our table and we moved to a table for 2. This family was much appreciated, I said to them if I do something nice for someone else someone will do something nice for someone else. I felt I did what was right. The hostess was so happy that she gave Katy and I 2 free desserts.  Now for what we had for dinner I had the pork ribs with fries, corn cake and house slaw it was off the charts. Katy had the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy and she said it was awesome.  The desserts we had were a brownie with berry sauce and vanilla ice cream and the second one was a baked chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream. The whole meal was awesome.  We wanted to make the family feel special so we had Sara give them the Fudge Brownie dessert after we left. I would have loved to see their faces when it arrived.  Keep up the good work Kitchen 56 your the best.",

But everyone was very friendly and we got our food very fast since it's not like the kitchen was busy!  I ordered a salad and boyfriend ordered the mac and cheese. First thing we noticed was that all the dishes were chipped. Each bowl had at least 3 chips on it. Do they have a clumsy dishwasher? Is that the look they are going for? Not sure but it was a little off-putting to eat off of broken dishes.  The salad was pretty good. Not great. Decent enough size but the dressing was kinda blah. Boyfriend felt the same way about his mac and cheese. It was good but not great.  I wish the food had been better because I liked the atmosphere and like I said the staff was very nice. I just don't feel compelled to go back again. Sorry!",

I ordered the Cabernet braised short rib with parsnip puree...Perfectly done, tender, fallin apart good sized portion and seasoned perfectly. Yummm!! My date had the mac 'n cheese and it was delicious! Not too heavy on the cheeze/cream and excellent flavor and al dente shell pasta. Perfect!  Manager Brittney was also very friendly and helpful.

    "text": "I've been to Kitchen 56 for a couple of happy hours before and the experiences were probably about 3.5 star-worthy.  The outdoor patio is cute, the wine selection is decent, and the happy hour is better than the Vig's if you prefer wine over beer.  This solidly-decent streak was broken last night when seven of us showed up and were told there was no room for us on the patio.  Fine, we took a table in the dining room.  A manager stopped by to apologize for not being able to accomodate our desire to sit outdoors.  We forgave her.  Our waiter was surly, telling us he was the one who was \"forced\" to help us.  I get that it was a wry joke (maybe!) but there was zero humor behind it, and he seemed more genuine than not.  He then informed us that we did not \"qualify\" for happy hour because we were not seated at the bar or on the patio.  He was so unapologetic that I thought he was joking.  We asked if we could have the special anyway as we were there specifically FOR happy hour and had intended to sit outside if the few tables had not already been taken.  He disappeared to ask and returned with a solid N-O.  We decided that this would not stand, and walked out as multiple members of the waitstaff and the manager watched, expressionless.  Guess they had already made too much money that day and didn't have any more room for ours.  The dining room was empty, by the way.  WTF mate?  Seven of us could easily have racked that tab up to $200 in drinks alone, if only they had let us partake of their flimsy happy hour deals (which do not include food specials) for the one hour that was remaining of the special.  Real nice, Kitchen 56.  REAL NICE.  They really deserve one star for that as my previous experiences weren't exactly shining examples of service, but, unlike the staff at Kitchen 56, I am feeling a little generous today.",

Amazing happy hour menu, lovely craft beers on tap, extensive wine list and they make a mean martini!

    "text": "A cool place to eat and drink located in a \"historic\" spot.  Kitchen 56 was converted from an abandoned classic gas station into a modern little restaurant.  If you take the time to notice your surroundings, you can kind of tell the location's history by the convenient store layout of the restaurant and the parking lot.  Or just take a hint from giant picture of the old gas station on the wall.  The menu is interesting but very hit and miss.  We tried the drunk bread because it just sounded like something that we had to try.  Bread soaked in wine and baked with a gooey cheese.  It looked great when it arrived at the table, but when we had a bite, it tasted like you're the one getting drunk.  I didn't taste the wine flavor, I felt it.  A unique idea, but unfortunate fail.  I had the smoked salmon pizza.  It's like a bagel and cream cheese with arugula spread across the top.  It was pretty good, nothing I'd go out of my way to have again.  The arugula was just kind of toss on the top, so it fell all over the place.  My girlfriend had the short ribs, which were awesome.  The celery root puree it was place over was incredible.  The other couple we dined with had the pork tenderloin and the filet.  The filet came with sauteed onions (an oddly big portion placed off to the side) and green chile macaroni.  The macaroni is were we noticed some trouble with the service.  It the side dish was cool when the plate arrived.  No big deal, my friend who ordered it simply told the server.  He took the whole plate to have it fixed.  That's pretty lame for just a side dish.  She had to sit and wait while they heated everything back up.  It only took a few minutes, but felt a little unnecessary.  A manager did come out to apologize and check if everything was okay.  We also didn't come close to finishing the drunk bread, but no one ever said anything or asked us how it was.  The runner that brought us our food simply asked if we were done and cleared it.  Usually, if an appetizer for the table is not finished, that should be a sign that it was not enjoyed.  Perhaps a good time to ask the customers if there's something they can do to make it better the next time.  None of it was a terrible experience.  This is one of those unfortunate times when I wish Yelp gave half stars.  While I feel Kitchen 56 is better than A-Ok, it certainly is not at a point were I'd say I am definitely a fan.  If I lived closer to the arcadia area, I'd probably be more open to going back to give it another try.  There's plenty on the menu that I would like to try.  But there's too many places closer to me in north Scottsdale that I would prefer to try first.  One other random note.  When we first arrived, there was a young girl playing some acoustic guitar.  It was a little awkward that she was just sitting at table near the entrance (there's no stage or anything like that), but she was pretty good and it was quite enjoyable.  There's always something nice about subtle light live music.  She was only there until about 7:00.  I highly recommend they find a way to feature someone like her, and have that musician stay later.",

But, my black angus burger I could've made at home--and I'm still not entirely sure there was any alcohol in my adult lemonade.    Maybe they were lacking music?  I don't remember any music now that I think about it.  Anyway, not a fan.  Probably won't return more than once to give them a second chance.",

A patio dining experience to me is twinkle lights, hanging plants, cozy chairs, laughter, a friendly bar tender who likes their job, tells jokes, has a warm vibe... but no... none of this. Also, why do people decide to open places like this without great simple food? They should make friends with the owner of Wally's, and take a few notes. Good food+ laid back vibe= talk of the neighborhood. Not a difficult business model.   I'd like this place to add some fun tables out front, where you can sip on wine and enjoy the vibe of the hood, some nice outdoor music, hanging planters, a courtyard with grass instead of the 5 parking spots they have there...a doggie dish outside of it all with a menu that has the best wings in town, the best pasta dishes, a nice breakfast menue, and a neat coffee bar!",

    "text": "Kitchen 56 is a neighborhood restaurant with a full bar located in the Arcadia area of Phoenix.  It came highly recommended to me by some of my neighbors.  My first impression upon walking into the restaurant was very good.  I love the casual, clean decor and the place just has a nice neighborhood feel to it.  I was greeted immediately and was seated without delay. I was there for a late brunch or lunch on a Sunday. The place was not busy at all.  There were a couple of people at the bar and two other tables inside were occupied.  I know they have a patio but I did not venture so I don't know how many people were there but there were not many cars in the parking lot.  My waiter came over and took my drink order within a couple of minutes of me being seated and then took my brunch order when he brought my drink.  He was pleasant, had the expected smile however, he never introduced himself so I have no idea what his name is.  I ordered the ginger spritzer for a drink and the three cheese & basil omelet with fruit and potatoes for my brunch order. The order took a little longer then I would expect for an omelet on a not-so-busy day but I took that as a good sign thinking the chef was just preparing everything fresh and with care.   After the waiter delivered my food, he was never to be seen again!  I was also wrong about the expected quality of the omelet.  This was probably the most poorly prepared omelet I have ever had.  Even one of those breakfast-chain restaurants does a better job.  The omelet was over-cooked, there was no sign of any basil in the omelet and it was extremely salty.  The fruit consisted of a dry orange wedge and one average strawberry.  I did find the basil, it was on the potatoes which were also too salty but otherwise cooked well.  I thought about complaining and probably should have.  But I figured my waiter would stop by soon to ask if everything was okay. No waiter.  After several minutes the owner stopped by and asked, my reply was \"Do you really want to know?\" I told her it was salty and there was no basil in the omelet.  She went back to the kitchen and then offered a free desert which I declined. She then offered to re-make the omelet but I declined that also as I was short on time.  I have to say, she was very apologetic, sincere and pleasant to talk with.  Based solely on her pleasantness and attitude along with my neighbor's recommendation, I will give this place a second chance but there are some obvious issues that she must resolve with her wait and cook staff.  It's a shame that this happened at a restaurant with SO MUCH potential in an up-scale neighborhood. It is these kinds of things that will make or break an independent, neighborhood restaurant.  My check was presented to me by the owner (again, not the waiter) and she only charged me for my drink.  I was grateful and told her she really didn't need to comp the food, so I paid for the drink and about  1/2 of what the omelet should have been. I will go back sometime although Kitchen 56 is not on my priority list right now.  I will hope for better service and food up to the standards of such a nice place.",

    "text": "Second visit confirms that it's probably the nicest converted former gas station I've ever dined in. The views of Camelback mountain and the overall architectural feel of the place can't be faulted. Makes one marvel at the foresight of whomever laid out the original Enco gas station back in 1960 or whenever it was first established.   Kinda reminds me of the Vig in overall feel, menu, and aesthetic. Not a bad point of comparison at all. There was music on the patio (guitarist doing good covers of things like \"Long Train Running\") that wafted through the open roll-up doors.  The \"Deluxe\" burger is covered in sauteed mushrooms and is fairly good, though I sense that the patty is pre-formed and not hand-formed on site. There are some interesting appetizer items available.   Service was quick and without complaint.  The wine list is probably the biggest attraction among the offerings, though a full bar is available as well. For happy hour the wines are discounted by $2 per glass. You can get some fairly interesting stuff here (We ordered a bottle of pretty good cab sauv).  I see this place as a destination for Sunday morning bike rides down the canal.",

The patio is nice, but the time we sat there for lunch -- it was honestly swarming with flies. After about 20 minutes the waitress did bring out some candles, but it really killed it for me. We've had flies inside too-- makes me wonder whats going on in the kitchen. THe food is good -- but I don't really think it is worth the price. Even with the view and location thrown in.  The kicker for me, was last time we went, our family of four spent about 70 + but my child asked for half and half of  the children's sides (a little fruit and a few fries). Most places will do this-- fries are cheap and cantalope is like a dollar a bucket. But no-- they can't do that at 56 - you have to order extra. Then I see a statement on the menu \"If you liked your food, send a 6-pack of PBJs to the chefs for $10\" So now I get to overpay for food, and tip for average service, and I'm encouraged to buy the chefs their after/during shift drinks???   It feels like the owners are there to pat themselves on the back - not create a great dining experience for the customers...",

Its mushroom 'tart' is really flatbread featuring mushrooms - competent but like some of their other menu items ($10-plus for a giant baked potato with pulled pork and the usual accoutrements) are overpriced. The green chili Mac and cheese may be a signature dish of 56 kitchen but it's a one-trick pony that can overwhelm so unless you're really into it, best select or split as a side.   On another night we were here, waited 10-12 minutes before we were served water and we had to ask to order another 10 minutes later - despite sitting at the bar, where there were two servers. The prosciutto and figs pizza came out half lukewarm, with 3 of the slices featuring no prosciutto. Granted, there was a large (trivia) party in dining room but it's still lackluster execution.  The staff's friendliness doesn't overcome these shortcomings, alas.",

We also split the bbq pizza and the baked potato. The pizza wasn't anything to write home about, but the potato was delicious! Smothered with more bbq pulled pork and cheese, it was delicious.   If you're looking for a cute place to grab a casual dinner this is a great place! All the food coming out of the kitchen looked delicious and is affordable. I will definitely be back!",

The bottle of wine we ordered was out of stock, so our server suggested another bottle but offered it at the same price as the bottle we wanted.  Nice gesture.    The corn cakes with pulled pork appetizer was probably the highlight of the meal.  Very good.  The Arcadia Salad was also good.  Being from New Mexico and loving green chile, the green chile Mac n Cheese was a little dissapointing.  The ribs were ok.  Certainly not fall off the bone.  Love the ambiance and openess...with the exception of the music.  More about that below.  Interesting artwork with the chalk board feature, although it is so cluttered to the point that we couldn't take it all in.  Sometimes less is more.    As I aluded to earlier...I'm a firm believer that music is the single-most make or break factor to a great ambiance.  The music simply does not fit.  Paula Abdul did not add to my enjoyment of dinner in any way.  Maybe we were just at a cheesy point of the mix, but I think some more edgy/progressive/hip music could do a lot in further creating an enjoyable ambiance.  Overall, I'm a fan.  Good Job.",

Looked cool with the red and yellow bell peppers on it - the turkey burger that is...cooked fine, and tasted dyn-o-mite.    So style and taste bonus points.  Salad was fresh with a nails mustard ving dressing?  Ok.  It's got a cool little atmosphere for a Happy Hour; great little wine bar off to the side.    Recommend.",

I usually end up paying for a full meal even though I can't eat the bun, fixings, sides etc. Our server and the kitchen were so accommodating.

Over abundance of weird lettuce filling and not much else other than little chunks of chicken.  Soft pretzels- ok. Not the best in this region. Dipping sauce was also just ok.   Chicken wings - pretty good. Unique flavor.   Calamari- ok. No dipping sauce but came with a red pepper drizzle. Not super flavorful.   Overall the food was nothing spectacular.

I ordered their kale + quinoa salad for lunch {add chicken} and it was incredible! It was a VERY hearty salad and I was super full by the end of it! It is hard to find a good, hunger satisfying salad these days and Kitchen 56 definitely does not disappoint!  The fiance had the green chili burger and loved it, but I loved the hand-cut fries even more!!! They were so yum {sorry Ben P. for stealing most of them!}. ;) He secretly orders fries because he knows I love them {insert awwwwwww here}.

    "text": "Trying a new place that I drive by to go to work everyday!! Short ribs with red wine reduced sauce, Brussels sprout hash, mash potatoes, and a beer called Odell's Levity (drink special). My short ribs are from normal menu, but their happy hour looks awesome!! I'll have to try the happy hour next time! Conclusion: the short ribs where tender and delicious the red wine sauce on the ribs were perfect. I loved the Brussels sprout hash (added some pepper for seasoning). And the mash potatoes were creamy but need salt and paper by themselves (or maybe some parsley or other seasoning). If you eat the potatoes with the ribs- perfect! In my opinion, the beer is perfect for this meal- not too sweet and not too bitter. yummy!! I sat at the bar; it's wasn't busy hour. The drink and food came quick. The place looks great and the bartender was friendly and informative about what was on the menu. Yummy- great place!!",

We came on a Saturday during happy hour, which is 3:00 to 6:00 every day. Nice. Would like to see more of a beer selection, but at least they had one IPA on tap. $1 off during happy hour. $6 for fancy drinks, so my wife tried their Moscow Mule. Happy hour apps were $6. We got the chicken tacos and the wings. Good deal on the tacos, you get 4, but not so good on the wings as you only get 6. We got our wings naked, and waiter offered all 3 sauces on the side. We tried 2. The Garlic one and the Bruce Lee sauce, which was a sweet chili Thai type. Both were good. The tacos were a bit dry and bland, but the garlic wing sauce served well to take care of that. Service was excellent. We'll be back.",

The burgers have always been very tasty as well. The one thing I would criticize is the portions on some of the food. The mac n cheese is not exactly a hefty portion, and the salads are a bit on the small side. Other than that, A+.  It's a mostly quiet restaurant with a nice, dog friendly patio and an enjoyable bar to sit at. We probably go here once a month and will continue to do so.   Update : I'm really sad to say that after their renovations and re-opening, Kitchen 56 just isn't the same. They took several really good items off of the menu, including the green Chile Mac and the pizza that I loved before. They also increased their prices. I used to frequent the bar quite a bit, unfortunately with these changes I just don't see myself going back.",

I predict will soon be an Arcadia favorite.   The service was spot on.  And the food was fantastic. I had the pulled pork. Excellent. The wings are great and I recommend the Thai Sweet Chili on them. My wife had the Avocado toast, also excellent. Careful though, it's a large portion as are all the potions I saw being brought out to tables.  My kids dug the Mac and cheese and the Grilled Cheese sandwich.   I don't know if the owners or chef are the same but if so, congratulations for turning this place into a great neighborhood spot.",

We were seated by around 7:20pm and were unable to place our food order for over 30 minutes after being seated. After placing our order the server returned after 1 hour and ten minutes to state that they just got to our ticket and that they were currently out of a selection requested. Without presentation of a menu and stating \"our kitchen has finally reached your ticket\", I requested an additional entree from my memory. I asked for a side Brussel sprouts and they were out of those as well. After almost two hours of being sat, we finally received our entrees. My friend's food being lukewarm and mine, extremely hot, we requested our checks. Nothing was complimented and we waited an additional 15 minutes for our checks to be taken.

The bar tender tried to remedy the situation by putting the bottle in a chiller.   Not a place for wine lovers like ourselves.  We came back last night and had a terrible experience.  We ordered the Emeritus Pinot again.  Fortunately it was properly served :). We orders the steak frites for dinner (my favorite) and were served a steak salad.  We sent the salads back .  I kid you not, the kitchen scraped the steak off, added some frites and served It to us cold.  Pathetic.  We sent it back.   The manager came out and offered  us free dessert, never mind that we hadn't eaten anything for dinner....We were not at Denny's (although I wish we were), a brownie doesn't make it all better...we paid for the wine, left and went to Humble Pie.   I don't think we will give this place a third try.",

    "text": "Stopped in for lunch today with high hopes. My husband & I have been wanting to check this place out. We started out with the chips & dip. It was just okay, the dip to me tasted like french onion soup mix and the chips (while made in house) were somewhat bland. For lunch, I ordered the green mac & cheese and my husband had the chicken firebread. Our entrees took about 40 minutes even though they seemed to be quite slow. Not one to give up on a place when they may just be having a bad day I was hoping that I'd be impressed enough with our meals to return. That was not the case.   My mac & cheese was good, but was cold when it got to the table. If I'm waiting 40 minutes for a meal it should be hot when it arrives. It was something I'd try again, but since we won't be going back I guess I'll have to find my mac & cheese elsewhere.  Besides also being cold, my husband's firebread HAD A HAIR IN IT! Definitely not okay. When we informed our waitress she didn't seem fazed, she simply offered to get him something else. When he told her he didn't want to wait another 40 minutes she rudely replied that she had coursed our meal out & didn't have them fire the entrees until we were done with our appetizer. Which would have been fine if True, but it took us maybe 10 minutes to eat our chips & dip. So I doubt our entrees took 30 minutes.  Overall we were severely disappointed & won't be back. Seems like a cool place to drink though...",

The Cons: the space isn't used well. They need to make the bar area a lot bigger and use their space more wisely. There is a lot of floor and not enough chairs. They should also expand their local beer menu. I was sad the Four Peaks Peach had left.  The Pros: good happy hour menu, good food, unique specialty drink menu and an attentive staff.  The fish tacos were tasty and the black cherry lemonade was ok. Tacos, I love em. I think this place can make it. It had a crowd all night. Cheers!",

I have no complaints with the personnel.  Unfortunately, my rating is as is because of the food. The food is the key to a good restaurant so it's going to drive my rating.  I had the \"Black Angus Burger\" which ultimately amounted to two beef patties with cheese on a bun. It was sort of like meatloaf between buns. I admit I left the onions off but I guess I didn't read the menu carefully enough - that's all it was. No lettuce, no tomatoes, nothing else except some pickles attached to the top with a toothpick. It was just a hunk of meat with cheese. I have to say it was a bit gross.  My companion had the \"Chicken Salad Wrap\" which also turned out to be surprisingly simple. Basically some chicken salad scooped into a soft bread rolled into a wrap. Nothing special.  Both entrees came with fries that neither of us found particularly good.  We were both disappointed but we are going to give it another try. Maybe we just ordered two of their less than stellar menu items. However, a burger is pretty basic.  So... I can't say don't go but at this point, the food just doesn't hold up. Again, no problems with the atmosphere or staff.",

Of course any burger is great when you have a heaping mountain of bacon on it! We have frequent guests that fly in from France for work and we always bring them here after we pick them up from the airport. If the French guys say the food is good it must be great!

He seemed pretty frazzled.  About 5 minutes later our drinks were dropped off by someone else, who did not ask if we needed anything.  Another 5 Minutes pass and a female server comes to our table and asks if we are ready to order. No, \"Hi my name is\"... \"let me tell you about the menu\", nothing!  I told her I would like to order a drink and she seemed annoyed, like I was being rude.  She took my drink order and our appetizer order and left.    We started with the Onion straws, a little greasy but overall pretty tasty especially because the sauce was fantastic.  For my cocktail I had a Maple Manhattan, which was so delicious one of the best Manhattan's I've had.     For dinner I ordered their tofu and vegetable stir fry with Soba Noodles. This had received good reviews from fellow yelpers so I was excited to try it.  I was greatly disappointed. The noodles were over cooked, it had no flavor except ginger and there were no vegetables in it except red cabbage.  I never send anything back, but I did. This of course took about 10 minutes, because our server never came back to check on us. I flagged down a manager and she suggested the green chili macaroni.  By the time this came out, Hottie had already finished his meal and his plate had been taken. This kind of kills the dining experience.  When the macaroni came out, it was much better, great flavor and just the right amount of creaminess and spice. Again the noodles were a little over cooked; they were breaking apart, but still edible.   Overall, the service was pretty poor, but being a former Server I could tell that they were all \"In the weeds\" so I gave her a break, and still left a 30% tip.  The food was good, but not great.  I think I would try Kitchen 56 again under the right circumstances, but with so many other options in the area, it won't be anytime soon.",

I had the trout and he had the happy hour fish and chips. Our food was delicious. I think the only thing I had a bit of complaint was I felt a bit rushed. However, the food and drinks are amazing. The fish and chips were fresh and so crispy. The trout dish had green beans and peanuts. I ordered mash as a side too. Fish was seasoned perfectly and green beans were crunchy not soggy.    Overall,  I had a great experience and will return!",

    "text": "I have finally decided how to handle the 1/2 star.  It's going to hinge on service.  And the service at Kitchen 56 was barely passable.  Our server was slow to get to us, took the order of a table that arrived later than us before she took ours.  She then ignored us once we got our food.  After it became clear we weren't going to see our check anytime soon, my husband gave the evil eye to the hostess, followed by a point to our server who was, in her defense, busy flirting with any and all male employees nearby. I hope that worked out for her.  If I ignore all that, I could really like Kitchen 56.  I like the simple menu of pizzas, pasta, and casual American food.  We started with the drunk bread (kind of like a deep dish pizza with bread soaked in white wine and butter).  It sounded better than it is.  However, my burger was great, and I could see Kitchen 56 being a great go-to spot for me.",

I split the corn cake appetizer and fig and goat cheese pizza with the husband. Normally you'd get the appetizer first, but everything came out at once.  No big deal, I mean the server didn't ask and we didn't specify, so really no love lost there, just an observation.  The descriptions of both made them exciting choices. Then they arrived to our table. Really quickly at least.  The pizza looked good, the appetizer did not.  But whatevs, all looks the same in the end right? The barbecue sauce used on the pork for the appetizer was too vinegary.  The pork was fine, the corn cakes were ok.  Like the presentation the dish was lackluster. Same with the pizza.  We have had goat cheese and fig pizzas elsewhere and this one failed to compete.  The blobs of goat cheese were a little gamey for my liking, and rather than use actual figs they chose an overly tart spread, again in globs.  The crust was fine.  boring.  May be back for a cocktail on the patio,  but dinner will be elsewhere.",

I was expecting a lot from the food and drink and was a little disappointed.    The edamame is amazing.  Splashed with a soy-oyster sauce mix, it was huge enough for four people to share.  The salad I ordered was fine.  Nothing to gush about.  My companions, including one picky kid, LOVED their burgers and omelets.  The fries were undercooked, cold inside and inedible.  The \"adult lemonade\" drinks sounded interesting, but the one I ordered (cucumber-basil) was so horrible I could barely take more than a few sips before abandoning it.  My companion also ordered one, a different flavor, and agreed that it was not good.  Despite the history of the building, the food was bland and uninspiring.",

We made it just in time for happy hour 3-6pm, even on a Sunday!   We enjoyed the chicken taco from the \"temptation\" section of the menu. As well as the Burger, added bacon, no bun with a side Cesar salad without croutons.   I appreciate how they ask if we have any allergies as we order!  I do have a gluten allergy and dining out can be tricky sometimes.   We enjoyed the strawberry kiwi Lemonade and the Camelback cocktail along with a mimosa. Delicious drinks. The Camelback was strong with 2 tequilas.   Glad we made it in, services was great!",

I do have to point out that the parking is super limited, the plaza is shared between many businesses and there is not too much parking!  When we walked in we were greeted immediately and asked if we wanted to sit outside or inside. With the weather in AZ being amazing lately, we said outside. I was immediately regretting my decision when I was all of a sudden feeling a tickle, then an itch, then another itch, and another and so on. There were SWARMS of mosquitos. Thats totally beside the point, not K56's fault, but our waiter was so kind, we could still enjoy our night outside because he immediately lit like 6 bug repellent tiki burners. They have little tea lights overhead and the ambiance was cute! He was also really nice when he had a hard time deciding on what to eat and drink. Service was great here.  I would definitely say that the menu here is pretty casual, varying from tacos to burgers, baked potatoes and sandwiches.  We all ordered alcoholic drinks, I got a Rose Mule and let me tell you, they DO NOT skimp on their alcohol. It was refreshing although I couldn't finish it. The gals and I all agreed that we all felt pretty buzzed at half glass.   As for food I got the Lemon Pepper chicken. It was so yummy! It was lightly breaded and lemon pepper seasoned and sauced well. The chicken was not dry at all but plump and juicy (hard to find for me). It came on a bed of cauliflower risotto, both parts yummy and healthy! The texture of the cauliflower wasn't as mushy as I thought it would be, but the crisp texture was a really nice pairing with the chicken!",

A very good friend and I were going to give this place another try.  I believe we got there around 8:30 pm. They were already putting up chairs as if they were ready to leave.  The manager seemed annoyed that we were coming in to eat, when clearly, he and his staff just wanted to go home. I asked if the crispy chicken was spicy, and was told no.  Just in case, I ordered the aioli spread on the side. The sandwich came with some extremely spicy pickles. The experience just reminds me why this place has had trouble in the past.   To put the icing on the cake, the manager turned down 4-6 customers from out of town.  Note:  we sent them to Tee Pee.    As with many people in the community, Kitchen 56 continues to disappoint.  This is the last time I will be giving them my business.",

    "text": "My first visit to this restaurant was two weeks ago. I tried their cinnamon chocolate cake, which I couldn't stop thinking about!  The best dessert I've ever tasted in a restaurant.  I also ordered the lemon chicken which was cooked to perfection. Went back today (remember the dessert). This time I tried the shaved Brussels salad with salmon.  The salad is full of flavor. I especially like the little bit of heat from jalapenos. The salmon filet was huge and also cooked to perfection.  And, of course, the cinnamon chocolate cake.  The ambience of the restaurant is very intimate and modern with outdoor seating as well. The staff is friendly and their playlist of music makes you want to stay.  I'm sure if you visit Kitchen 56 you will have a positive experience.",

We love hitting up happy hours spots let me say the chicken tacos and the short rib tacos are super tasty and quite filling. We also ordered the cauliflower risotto that was the bomb!  They have nice patio love the new redesign on the inside. The only downside is the parking lot is a little small. Great neighborhood hangout with nice ambiance and excellent food!",

I thought everything was lovely! It was Mother's Day and the waiter gave my daughter a rose to give to me- that was super sweet! It's the little things I guess :)   My daughter said she loved the hamburger, but she serious a connoisseur of burgers (I think) and she likes them almost rare! I ordered the Avocado Toast, which I understand isn't exciting to most- but being a vegetarian I thought it was delightful.   I can't remember the name of the cocktail I ordered.... however it came in a Moscow Mule cup and it was delicious! I could have drank those all day! Very refreshing!   Anytime we have gone it seems parking is easy and not a lot of traffic. Of course being from California my perception of \"busy\" and \"parking\" might be a bit obscure for AZ!   Regardless I enjoyed my 3 experiences at Kitchen 56!",

Burgers overcooked, fried calamari like rubber bands, pizza crust doughy.  Sorry... we really do like the place but the food is a disappointment.",

The steak seemed to have been cooked a bit more rare than medium so I was surprised the meat was as tough as a shoe.  Our waiter was great and replaced it with a burger and although not bad it wasn't anything special.   They have a very limited dinner menu, the restaurant was empty on a Saturday night so not much of an ambiance.    Their fries were delicious and customer service was good. The cocktail menu seemed original, but I wasn't able to drink that night. Maybe I'd go back just to try drinks, but not interested in eating there again.",

Nothing remarkable about this place food wise. I ordered a moscow mule and it was good.  We were outside on the patio which is super cute. Definitely a great place to have some wine and sit outside and enjoy the perfect weather.   I need to try the main dishes because I wasn't that impressed with the food we had. We tried their chicken wings, ahi avocado salad of some sort, flatbread and parmesan, and then my frriend's quesadilla. It wasn't that the food was bad, it's just not something that I'm ever gonna think about and be like \"hey, remember xyz at Kitchen 56?\".   Worth a shot to try but it's just whatever.",

Love Kitchen 56. Formerly Vatra, still great feel, great look and great bevs and food!   We stopped in last Sunday after I took my lady friends and mom by my wedding venue. We were starving, wanted a patio, good wine and a table quickly, Kitchen 56 had all of the above so that is where we headed. I have no idea why they are not busier on Sundays, but whatev, works well for me.   *Hint: they have happy hour all day on Sunday, wine is cheaper by the glass than by the bottle*  We each ordered yummy glasses of white wine and some lunch. I had the Turkey Panini, yum so good, the garlic aioli is awesome!!! Their fries are ok, nothing to write home about, not worth the calories I don't think.   Only criticism was that the bartender didn't really seem to know what was going on, she half asses the explanation of happy hour, miss quoted a price on one of the glasses of wine and had to go check on just about everything. We seemed to have like 4 people waiting on us and had to ask for a couple of things more than once.   But over all had a great time, and will totally be back!",

    "text": "This was our third time here. Our first experience was great- that was last summer. Our second experience was last fall. I had asked if I could substitute the French fries that came on the side of my steak for a different vegetable. The server said I could only sub a salad, which was already the second side that came with the dish at the time. While I like salads, if I wanted that much I would have ordered a salad.  We went again tonight in the hopes that things would have improved. We made a reservation on Open Table. The hostess said they had reserved a table in the bar. Really? I asked if we could sit In the dining room instead. At least she said alright because the bar was quite noisy.  We ordered calamari to start. Then when it came to entrees I got the short ribs and my boyfriend got the baby back ribs. The calamari took a long time to come out. The table behind us got really quick, friendly service. When the entrees came out, all of our sides were mixed up. The runner asked if that was OK. Really? Um...no. He should have offered to re-plate it in the kitchen. Instead, we had to swap stuff around at the table, which was messy. I mean, who wants to try to scoop mashed potatoes to a different play with a fork and knife? Then our server came by and asked if everything was OK. We said that they screwed up the plates and she proceeded to show us her ticket where she wrote it down right, and blamed the kitchen. Still, no apology or anything.  To top it off, the table behind us got a free dessert from their server just for being flirty. Not that I wanted a free dessert. All I wanted was some customer service.  And there was a fly that simply wouldn't leave us alone once our food came.  Sorry, I'm going to give this place a pass next time it is suggested. There are better places in the area.  Oh yeah- that reservation we made on Open Table? It was cancelled by the restaurant after we left. Guess I won't be getting those points. Thanks, but no thanks, Kitchen 56.",

All their specialty drinks are very tasty (the Black Cherry Lemonade is awesome) but expensive. The views are great the place feels very comfortable inside, a great bar and good tables. I really watch what I eat and Kitchen 56 has some great menu options for low carb low fat items. They even have some vegetarian choices which is always nice to see.  While the prices are high I believe I get good value for my money. I am not going to go here to drink all day but stopping in during a bike ride on the canal is great (they do give a 10% discount for bike riders).",

All the times I have eaten there, I have never been unhappy with the food, service, or drinks.  The food is always full of flavor -- that calamari salad is unreal.  The short-ribs compete for the best-of in Phoenix.  Sadly, they don't have the duck breast entree anymore -- that was one of my favorite meals in Phoenix period.  The specialty drinks are excellent as well -- I really like the fact that they aren't over-sweet like so many these days -- they strike a great balance of ingredients that elevate the liquor instead of making it something it's not.  Finally the service is spot-on:  friendly, casual, and on-point.  The staff makes every effort to remember familiar faces, and they always seem to go the extra mile to make sure everything is dialed in for the time you spend there.  Solid!  If I *had* to critique something, the only thing that comes to mind is the furniture on the patio -- I just never feel comfortable sitting out there.",

One night I went with some girl friends and never looked back!   I lived in Boise Idaho for several years, and brand 44 North Huckleberry vodka was local to Idaho.  I searched high and low for bars in Phoenix that had 44 North and i was absolutely delighted when I found it on the menu of Kitchen 56!   I can not recommend their happy hour enough. Smokin deals - 5 street tacos for $5.56? YES PLEASE.  I also ALWAYS ordered their Brussels spout hash.  My favorite meals were by far the Ahi Tuna entree and the Short Ribs.  The burgers/sandwiches were mediocre, so stay away from those if you are looking for a True food experience.  I give only 4 stars because occasionally their service was lacking, often as a result of being short staffed.  And while their menu had stellar stand outs in my opinion, some items were a little lacking. Ted, the general manager, was great and made sure folks were enjoying their experience.    I would definitely recommend this place over the other local eateries that were often over crowded.  The live music on Sundays and Wednesdays was also a great touch!",

Our group came for Brunch.  Understaffed.  We had 15 people. Remember we told them 3 days before our arrival how large our party was. One waitress for that large party. Food came out very sporadically. Even 15 to 20 minutes apart. Then overcooked and not what people had order.  Then my husband and I went back about 3 weeks later. We were sat down. Then 5 minutes went by before a person showed up at our table. Took our drink order. Then came back to take our order. Well then the real waiting  began. 15 minutes no drinks 35 minutes no food. Excuse given was the bartenders don't  know how to open a bottle of liquor that's why our drinks are late. Then our food was late due to new kitchen staff the same excuse that was  given when we went for brunch. Never again. Save yourself the trouble go to a Dennys.",

However, if you intend on eating I'd suggest you continue driving down the street to one of the many Scottsdale restaurants that will deliver a much better meal.    We were part of a large party with a pre-ordered dinner, so perhaps this played into the quality....really hard to say.  Our grilled romaine salad tasted very reminiscent of those days when my father would douse the bbq with lighter fluid and then attempt to tell us later the flavor that was strangely burning our tongues was \"outdoor grilling at it's best\".  Sorry, but it didn't work for Dad and it didn't work last night either.  I thought that perhaps the salad was a fluke, but unfortunately the disappointment continued through the bland spaghetti-o like pasta and the easy bake oven version of dessert.    If any of the food had displayed the slightest bit of potential, I would have been happy to give them another shot.  But life is short and there's too many other restaurants putting forth a much better effort.",

I will say the interior is much better than the previous incarnation, but the spots (lights) at the counter-height 4 top shone in my eyes and made me feel like it was last call...and I don't drink.",

Word of warning: there was a bit of a funky smell while sitting outside, and we think it was the canal. If it's really hot out, maybe think twice about sitting outside because I'm sure the heat will intensify the smell. Or maybe it was just something in the air Saturday night.   Anyway, on to the food!   I knew I wanted to get dessert so I went lighter for my meal. I went with their Santa Fe Grilled Chicken Breast which came with a petite salad. Salad was mixed greens with tomatoes and red onions and a vinaigrette dressing. Basic, but tasty. There was two HUGE pieces of chicken that came with the meal, so I was impressed with the portion size. I ate one piece and was able to box up the other for another meal.   For dessert I got their peanut butter and chocolate mousse. Yummy. Next time I want to try their sticky toffee pudding thing.   My boyfriend got their tempura tofu with veggies and soba noodles. I took a bite and it was pretty good, and he liked it as well. He did say it was better after adding some Sriracha.   Service was good though, and all around it was a good dining experience. Would definitely go back!",

    "text": "This is a local/neighborhood restaurant that has struggled since it opened.  The food is so-so; the hours somewhat sporadic, in that the restaurant and bar closes whenever business seems slow later in the evening; but service is by far its main downfall.  The last time I took my family there, it was over10 minutes after being seated before anyone made contact with us; it took us nearly 45 minutes after placing a food order to get the food (the place was not really busy); and no one bothered to check to see if things were alright at any point.  Tonight, I thought I'd give it another shot.  Again, I took the family, hoping to support a neighborhood business.  There were 3 servers working, and only 4 tables taken by customers.  Remarkably, it again took nearly 10 minutes for a server to make contact or ask for drink orders, then a long time to get the drinks.  Again, no one bothered to check on us after the food was served, even for new drink orders, which we would have made.  Instead of enjoying a meal out, we wound up aggravated, with over-tired and hungry kids.  One might think this is just bad luck, but on both occasions, the owner/manager was in the immediate vicinity, seemingly oblivious to what was going on around her.  Also, beware, although the childrens' menu says \"drinks included\" in the entree price of $6.00, this place charged us for the kids' milk.  Save your money and go down Indian School in either direction  There are several places that know what they are doing (not meaning OHSO).",

    "text": "I wish I lived closer and had a bike because a lot of their customers who were there on a Sunday afternoon came on their bikes and if I had a bike I would ride mine here. The open, airy layout and the windows create a very cheerful atmosphere. Inside is FRC concept decor:modern and casual. I started with a petite salad which I am mixed on. The dressing was a brandy vinaigrette which I was not crazy about. I don't like sweet dressings so that's what killed it. However the greens themselves were SO fresh I would have sworn they were picked from a garden, washed and served to me. It's greens like that that make me want to be an active salad eater instead of having one because my Mom always made me have one. My salad was followed by an Angus Burger which, good God, was AMAZING! The TWO patties prepared a perfect medium rare with, again, a red onion and lettuce that I swear were picked from a garden and put on my burger. The menu said that it was served with American cheese, which I HATE but this had to be the best damned American cheese I've ever had. It was a struggle to finish but I stayed the course.......and I succeeded. This was a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon. They have a bar that opens to a patio with some seating, and get this, a ping pong table. They'd better keep me the hell away from that after I've had a few otherwise guests are going to get hit. Definitely going on my faves list for Phoenix. Can't wait to come back for dinner.",

I had the Angus green chili burger. It tasted fine because the quality of the beef was well, but it was a very small patty. And the fries that came with it also tasted good but was a small portion. A restaurant should know that the cost of fries is so low compared to the other products and should stack the plate full of fries to compliment the meal. Again i feel that the place has potential. I would only comeback for strictly cocktails and would not eat off the menu unless i absolutly knew changes were made. Good service though.",

I have passed by countless times, but finally decided to check this place out and I took my mom for brunch for Mother's Day.  I went back for dinner this past weekend I liked it so much.  Both times the service was great and the food was delicious!  When I went for brunch I ordered the chilaquiles and Kitchen 56 is easily at the top of the list for great chilaquiles.  The perfect amount of spice (enough to taste it and give a good kick  without being over the top) in the sauce and the flour tortillas weren't greasy at all.  So often when the tortillas are fried in-house they come out greasy and more stale than crisp, but they were crunchy.  I tried the backporch 'adult' lemonade.  It was very refreshing and not overly sweet which I loved.  For my second visit I ordered the Short Ribs from the dinner menu and they were amazing! The meat was fork tender and tasty!  The mashed potatoes were seasoned well and had a great black pepper kick to them.  They were are little thicker and starchier than I would usually prefer (but that just proved that they were fresh made in house and not rehydrated out of a box which is the way I like it!!).  I also split the beet salad and it was amazing!  The balsamic dressing has a great bite to it without being too acidic from the vinegar and it goes so well with the crispy pancetta and goat cheese.  With the right protein the salad could easily be an entree meal!  I may have overindulged a bit when it comes to cocktails, but I tried the Moscow Mule and the '56' Cooler.  The Mule was spot on for what you'd expect.  I was intrigued by the '56' Cooler because it was basically a margarita with St Germain.....something about St Germain just draws me in.  Great balance of flavors between the grapefruit juice and the St Germain!  I can't wait to go again and try something else new on the menu.  I can't imagine that I'd be disappointed with anything on the menu!",

    "text": "I finally made the short trip to Kitchen 56 for lunch yesterday. Seeing as the overall rating sits at a comfortable 3.5 stars, I was never in any sort of rush to get here.  As I usually like to do, I went ahead and found a good seat at the bar to grab a drink and some food. The menu reads very straight forward and the selection is somewhat limited for brunch and lunch options, which isn't always so bad. After some debate I settled on the Green Chili Angus Burger and a Black Cherry 'Adult' Lemonade.  The drink came out and it was fine -  nothing too special about it, but it was refreshing and did it's job as a nice easy to drink cocktail. The burger was pretty uninspired. Yeah it had poblanos and pepperjack on it, but there wasn't even the slightest kick to it and I had to put some of my side salad on it to give it a little more flavor of some kind. I ordered medium, it came out medium-well....and so the story goes, an overall 'so-so' experience.  The service at the bar was good and attentive, the decor is nice, but the food isn't going to blow your socks off at all. I didn't come rushing into this place to begin with, and probably won't be rushing back.",

I am dinging a star because while the bartender did point out the happy hour drink specials, we had no idea that there were FOOD specials.  This was never mentioned nor was the HH food menu given to us. We found this out AFTER we ordered and ate.  Annoying.  The food was delicious as were the drinks.   The live music is a nice relaxing touch and the patio is spacious with a small fountain, although misters would be nice outside.",

    "text": "I love places that adventure with basics. It's like planning a camping trip and instead of packing a cot, you managed to get a massaging bed up the mountain. Ok real terrible analogy, but basically, the traditional method works and does the job, but sometimes you want a little more.   This place had great ideas, but I just didn't love it. I ordered the pretzels for an app, with the beer cheese. The pretzels were loaves, which I should have guessed meant they weren't the super chewy things I love to eat. Not to say they were bad, but just ok. The cheese sauce I did totally love though, and I may or may not have licked that bowl clean. Discreetly of course.   I also ordered a side of brussel sprout hash and while the texture and the cooking process of these delightful veggies was spot on, they needed something else. Some pizazz. They underwhelmed me, which was sad.   For our entree, we got the steak and blue cheese pizza. Again, great idea, less than amazing execution. I couldn't taste any blue cheese at all. None. Nada. And it really needed that zip. Without the tang it was kinda like a quesadilla with a sprinkle of steak and mushrooms. I didn't get the garlic taste at all either and to continue there is maybe a light smattering of steak on this thing, so if you are feeling meaty skip it. The mushrooms do help on that department, but not enough. The crust was good, I did like that.  And lastly, I got a raspberry mojito. I love love love mojitos, so refreshing and not too sweet. Well this one was sour. Whew. It had real raspberries (not sure if fresh or frozen) which were mega tart. It was palatable but a little tough to enjoy wholeheartedly.   The atmosphere was great. I love that. I love the visit and story and the service was great. Just a little more love on the food. I want to taste that extra bit.",

I had the Vegetable Firebread, my girlfriends had the Turkey Firebread and Turkey Cranberry Firebread and they all came with fries. When they came out we were shocked at how big the servings were! You can easily share a sandwich with someone as we all took the other 1/2 with us to go. I LOVED my Firebread sandwich. The vegetables were great and the spread wasn't too overpowering. Both my girlfriends really liked their sandwiches too. The services was great and I cannot wait to bring my boyfriend back for lunch or dinner soon!",

    "text": "I pine for the glory days of Kitchen 56 - the happy hours that were the stuff of legend, when a fiver would buy you a dozen of the best wings in the Valley, a Martini that was really just a cup of ice-cold vodka with some stuffed olives, or a heaping plate of fish tacos. The late afternoons when I'd walk over with some coworkers, eat like a king, and gaze at Camelback Mountain looming a stone's throw away (well, a few throws at any rate), and wonder whether all things this good must sooner or later come to an end.  The beginning of the end was the new menu, a little slimmed down and marked by the only price increase that even I found as cute and endearing as it was necessary and irksome: 56 cents. $5.00 became $5.56, $10.00 became - you guessed it - $10.56. I admired their ingenious way of keeping up with inflation, but since then, the menu's undergone a few more drafts, the dozen wings became eight (I think?), a couple of my favorite waiters have moved on, and Kitchen 56 has slipped a little. I still whole-heartedly recommend it for the great patio, spectacular view, casual American fare, fun cocktails, and a few good beer choices. But I hope they find a way to become, once again, what they were for a brief Golden Age: hands-down, the best happy-hour joint in town.  In the meantime, though, go for their pizzas, wings (still absolutely delicious, even if not an incredible value anymore), Kitchen Sink Burger, and anything with Ahi. I'd definitely recommend their lunch and dinner over their brunch (not bad, but there are a half-dozen better brunches in the area). As for cocktails, the Moscow Mule, 56 Martini, Backporch Lemonade, and Elderflower Champagne... heck, they're all delicious!",

The most amazing chalkboard as a focal point.  Nice patio and open air bar.  Not sure what the food/vibe they are gong for... Local bar? Cafe? Restaurant? Awesome cocktails!  Odd mix of food and a slightly limited menu... But I still dig it and want to really like it!   The service is a little choppy but they are really nice.. Always!   The pizza is amazing!  Like really really good.   But I always try something else... Pot pie was underwhelming and lacking enough meat, Caesar salad was solid, Cobb salad was good but the turkey was just sliced deli turkey piled on top (presentation?).  Green chile mac was awesome! Wings were different and cooked well.   I ordered the brussel sprouts hash.  And this is a dish I make at home and love... And I was pretty disappointed with this one.   So much garlic it was actually spicy, I could see the red onions but couldn't taste them over the garlic.   And I love garlic but this was a clear miss.  Bummer.   Please chef!  Taste your food!  Think browned butter and bacon with the shaved sprouts!   Think less garlic...",

They brought a new one that was hot. It was very filling though wasn't what I expected. It was missing the buttery component and was more a pulled pork over potatoes dish. Satisfying though Brunch was disappointing. Menu items lacked meat components. Waitress told me the black beans in the 56 Scramble were funky. So I ordered the biscuits and gravy. The dish was unappetizingly served. A kind of white vomit.  A sprig of something would help. Biscuit was dry and not incorporating well. I ordered bacon side which was not on menu she asked if I liked it crispy I said yes. I got a huge wad of stuck together bacon. It was greasy and low grade. I felt sick immediately. My teeth are still covered in grease This place needs to work on their signature dishes and increase consistency and quality of product.  It's a nice environment with friendly staff.",

We sat in the bar at a high top table and took in the music and enjoyed the lively bar scene. As usual the food was super. We shared an artisan cheese plate with a bottle of Chardonnay. Both we very good. Then we shared a calzone and steak salad. The portions and prices are reasonable and the food was tasty. Our server was also the bartender and although he was super busy at the bar he was also very attentive to our needs. Extra parking is available across the street and we used it on this busy night. We will certainly be back.",

    "text": "Totally disappointed on so many levels with this place.  I went there last night  excited to finally try the place since I drive past it on my way to and from work everyday.  When it is all lit up at night it just seems so inviting.  I was meeting a friend to talk business and we arrived a bit before 830.  My experience started off bad and just went downhill from there.  When we walked in all the booths were taken but none of the tables in the dining room nor the 2 tables along the back wall that each seat 6 but have the comfy booth seats on one side.  We asked to be seated there but was told they needed to keep them open in case a large party came in.  Seriously?   It was a Wednesday night at 830, there would have been plenty of seating if a party larger than our meager 2 top came in.  Strike 1. Next our server Lissa did come by quickly to ask if we wanted to order, we asked for a few minutes.  I also asked what the soup of the day was, butternut squash, mmmmm! Those few minutes turned into more than a few and another server asked if we needed anything and ended up taking our order.  I ordered the soup and tuna tartar.  Lissa then came back to the table to inform us that they were out of the soup of the day.  Strike 2.  I order a side of vegetables instead. Lissa refills my water glass, brownie points for that, but spills some not only on the table but my hand.  She doesn't apologize, clean it up, nothing, just walks away.  Strike 3. My companion gets the edamame, which were not bad but the bowl that they were served in had a serious chip on the rim.  It was bad enough to cut someone if you weren't careful.  Strike 4. My tuna tartar was pretty terrible, a few chunks of chewy fish that were somewhat grey in color hidden among some greens that had way to many capers which made it super salty,  I ate a little less than half of it because I was so hungry and didn't want to deal with sending it back.  Strike 5. Next up the sorry ass, poor excuse for a side of vegetables,  When Lissa set down in front of me this tiny dish with wilted spinach and 1 piece of squash that was quartered and 1 piece of zucchini that was quartered I couldn't believe it.  There was a layer of spinach water at the bottom and it tasted like it was seasoned with Mrs. Dash.  Again I ate it because I was starving but realizing that each bite basically cost me a dollar, it was 5 bucks. Strike 6. Not even done yet...... At 9:30 Lissa asks us if we want anything else, my companion informs her that her boyfriend will be joining us in a few minutes to get some dinner.  We are informed that the kitchen is closed.  There were still people in the place and from what I gathered from the website the kitchen closes \"when the party is over.\"  So now my companion is on Yelp trying to find another place to go meet him so he can eat,  Strike 7. She finds a place not far and is going to meet her man by 10 because we still had some business to discuss.  I said she could just go so he didn't have to wait but always the professional, she stayed so we could wrap up our meeting. At 945 some people walk in, are seated and given menus.  I ask the server that helped them, a very nice gentleman, if they were going to be eating because we were told the kitchen was closed.  He went and checked and apologized for the mix-up but the kitchen was still open.  Strike 8.   I wish that guy was our server because he was great. I also see him speak to Lissa, who glances at our table but she never comes over herself to apologize.  I think she was in a hurry to clock out.  Strike 9 When Lissa brings us our bill, the soup that they were out of, was still on it.  When I point this out to her she states since I got the side of vegetables, which wasn't on the bill, she just left the soup in place of it.  First, from a management prospective, you have to keep track of everything that is served to figure out your food and production cost.  Second, it was just plain laziness to not correct the bill.  Strike 10. Furthermore the soup was 7 and the vegetables 5, a cost difference that I pointed out to her.  She said she would take care of it.  She brings back the bill and say, \"Ok they took a dollar off.\"  Are you kidding me?!  You can't subtract 5 from 7?!  Strike 11. I am so done with this place at this point I leave a chintzy $5 tip, I really wanted to leave nothing, but the old school server in me wouldn't allow it.  I left feeling cheated out of $70 and will never go back.",

I would have tried this place again for a second chance but for the sanitation practices of the staff. They need a stronger kitchen manager and a FOH manager! Very Disappointing!",

    "text": "My 87 year old grandmother took me here for lunch at noon on Friday. The restaurant was initially quite busy. We ordered the edamame starter. It was a large portion, heavily seasoned. My entree was the stir fry, while my grandmother ordered a large salad. The food came out quickly. My stir fry was alright but nothing I couldn't have had both better and cheaper at decent Chinese take out. My grandmother's salad was large but perhaps overpriced for a salad with no protein in it.   The reason for two stars is because my grandmother asked our server for help deciding a dessert that had been recently recommended in a newspaper review. The server was not helpful in recalling the item referenced in the prior-day's review. Giving up, we ordered two Creme brulees.  At this point, the restaurant  was very quiet. It was about ten minutes after ordering that I glanced over to the kitchen pass-through and saw a single Creme brulee sitting there on the counter. Another ten minutes passed before a different server noticed it and brought it to our table. I do not know if the bill had one or two desserts charged, but two were ordered and we only got one. It took so long for one to arrive that we didn't have time to wait for a second.   This incident, coupled with inattentive drink refills, makes me wonder if the young professionals in the restaurant getting their wine on during lunch break received  the same treatment as did my senior grandmother and my young female self.",

The place smelled like a sweet pulled pork.  I did not want to eat there when I saw what was on the menu.  My husband said give it a try and so we unfortunately did.  Urghhhhh. Horrible.

    "text": "Where to start?  For the last 25 hours I have been riding my toilet like it was a shit covered race horse charging me through the gates of gastrointestinal Hell.   Its now gotten so bad that the pyrotechnics in my ass have inspired me to changing show tunes into songs about what feels like giving rectal birth to a fire coated wet cappuccino machine, complete with foam and the associated noises that go with it.  One of the better ones I've come up with due to something going very, very wrong at Kitchen 56's kitchen was:  \"I feel shitty. Oh so shitty.  So shitty, and sharty and brown!!! And I pitty any girl who isn't shitting her brains out today!\"  I think the writers of West Side Story would be proud of the spin-off that's spinning down the bowl of my toilet right now.  The only thing I ate yesterday was a burger, fries, slaw and an iced tea at Kitchen 56.   My girlfriend had some of the same fries, the same slaw, and the same bun.  Since yesterday around 9pm to now, we've both been playing \"dueling bathrooms.\" Thank god we have two bathrooms, or someone would have had to use the bath tub.  So which of those four things was it? Or did someone just not  wash their hands in the kitchen after using the head? Either way, it wrecked my President's day.  And then there was the service. It was shitty too. Delivering the wrong meals to us, messing up the way the food was cooked and prepared, and forgetting about us for the first 20 minutes we were there.  All and all, even though its close to where we live, I won't be going back. One night of \"shitting myself skinny\" is enough. On the upside, this is the first burger that helped me to dropping 8 pounds over night. I think it was all out of my butt and from the sweats associated with the raw panic of going back into the toilet. When you're making deals with god, and are offering to give up your hedonistic ways, just because of one burger, its time to never, ever go back to wherever served it to you.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place for a while now since it is within  a few miles of where we live.  I finally was able to stop by and ordered the spaghetti and meatballs to go. While waiting for the order, I sat at a very comfortable barstool and was able to check out the dining room and look at the dinner menu.  I found the place to be somewhat cold, it definitely needs some ambiance. I enjoy minimalist interiors as much as the next person, but a couple of fresh flowers on the tables would go a long way here. When I returned home and opened my order, at first I thought they had made a mistake - the spaghetti looked like it was a children's order.  In addition, instead of the red marinara sauce I expected, the sauce was an orange color, like Chef Boyardee in a can. The pasta was the thick type of spaghetti, not the thinner, spaghettini type traditionally used in Italy,  and some sort of cheese was melted over it, also a no-no in traditional Italian kitchens. It tasted terrible - the pasta wasn't cooked al dente, it was overcooked and rubbery, the sauce had no taste and the tasteless cheese just made rubbery mess out of the whole dish. The meatballs were just okay, and again, they had the mystery cheese melted over them, which took away from their taste. I am willing to give them another chance and would love to try some of the other pasta dishes, such as the papardelle with pork sauce,  but I would NOT recommend the spaghetti and meatballs to anyone.",
