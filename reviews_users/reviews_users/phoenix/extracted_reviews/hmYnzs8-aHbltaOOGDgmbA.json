    "text": "I can't say I have ever actually been to Zipps and received service I was even remotely content with.  This trend of poor service seems to apply to all locations of this sports grill and gives me no reason to go back.  I went with a few friends to the Mill location and all of them ordered the same order except for my order which was the only different of the four.  After an excess amount of wait time after ordering (a common occurrence at Zipps) the waitress returned with my three friends meals but not mine.    After waiting another 10 -15 minutes she finally returned and when I asked where my meal was she was confused and did not have it.  So she took my order again, with attitude, and my meal wasn't brought to me until about 10 minutes after everyone I was with had already finished theirs.  When I saw a manager approaching me with the food I was expecting some type of compensation or at least an apology, however I got almost the exact opposite.    The manager attempted to swing their mistake into blaming me for not having my food, which does not even make much sense.    So after poor service, immature management who can not hold themselves accountable for mistakes, and decent (at best) food, I will not be returning to any Zipps location again.",

    "text": "I am a HUGE lover of Zipps.. my bf & I, as well as my softball team, frequent the miller & camelback (old town Scottsdale) location at least once a week (normally like 2 times/week) & I have zero complaints.. this one on the other hand, oh my gosh. Where do I start:  We came this weekend, yes during the Tempe Arts Fest, but I was surprised at how not crowded it was, I have seen this place packed before for big games,.. but not this day, easy to get a table. So we find a table no problem, but it hasn't been cleaned yet, dirty plates and napkins on it, no big deal, but 10-15 minutes go by and no one has come by. Finally we stop a waitress and she apologizes and takes our order. We asked for two waters and a pitcher of Ranger. A few minutes later a lady comes with one 32 oz beer, nope we ordered a pitcher. Okay no big deal again..  and then the pitcher comes. Then we see her 10 minutes later and I ask for waters again, still nothing. Finally I was so thirsty I went up to the bar to order a water. Then we decided the slowness is crazy so we get the bill since we had to catch the light rail to Chase Field. We get the check & she didn't charge us the correct price for the pitcher, $15 instead of $10 (HH).. oh and that's all we got so its not like it was too challenging. So my bf goes and tells her the price is incorrect. Then I get the check back, and she ran my card for $25.. I'm guessing the $10 + $15? I was like oh my goshhhh how can this lady be SO bad at her job???? Like at least can someone tell us she's new or something?Then I would be way more understanding. But it was unreal, one error after another after another.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I visited Arizona from Texas this weekend. We decided to hit up Zipps Saturday evening thinking it'd be the best place to catch both of our college football games (Texas A&M and ASU) since they have about a bajillion TVs. We sat at the bar for several hours, had several drinks each, buffalo wings, and a large pepperoni pizza.   Pros: The food was pretty good. The wings were crisp but also extremely saucy. The pizza was fresh and hit the spot. Their margs were also pretty tasty. Most importantly, the TV situation here doesn't even kinda suck. There's a good size television every couple feet, which makes for optimal sports watching. And I'm not going to lie, I was pretty impressed when the 9 TVs merged into 1 giant screen when the ASU game started. I don't care who you are, that's cool!   Cons: The service was less than acceptable. From our very first greeting, we were just appalled with the attitude of our bartender. She was extremely short with us, and just plain rude. And it didn't stop with her. Every bartender after her also had the same kind of unpleasant disposition. It's like one of them caught a severe and extremely contagious case of Resting B*tch Face and then infected the whole bunch. It got to a point where everyone around us was also talking about how they didn't appreciate the way they were being treated.   Having lots of TVs is cool. Having decent food is also cool. But being treated with respect as a paying customer is the coolest. And in my opinion, it's the customer service that makes or breaks a place.",

We were also going to order food throughout. However, once our first pitcher, ziparita, and wings came out we never saw our server again. She was nowhere to be found... until we saw her watching the football game. By the time she came back it had been 20-30 minutes and we no longer had time for more food or drinks. I asked to speak to a manager then waited for another 15 minutes. The manager never came over. If you want to be disappointed on your birthday, then this is a good choice for you.",

    "text": "Quite literally Zipps on Mill Ave. in Tempe is a Horrible place to eat....   You walk in and nobody greets you... they are in a constant state of \"training\" new wait staff because the manager is a total douchebag... and they are on the edge of going out of business... so the food is cheap and they \"pad the bill\" with all kinds of undisclosed up charges...  And their turnover is high because wait staff likely quit all the time because the food is such poor quality..   The drinks at Zipps are watered down with the cheapest well liquor... yet they charge $6-$8 for a tiny drink during happy hour...   The chicken wings were laced with margarine hot sauce that makes your stomach rumble with each bite,... their fryer oil is filthy... the ranch is like tartar sauce and rancid tasting...  The onion rings are the most disgusting looking I've ever seen and their burger meat is cheap and raunchy tasting....  We ordered our drinks for 3 people.... and it took 3 different waitresses 25 minutes to get our drinks... We ordered drinks before 7pm on a Friday Happy hour... the place was barren and empty... Now we know why....  We were told she 'got our drinks in'.... yet they charged us full price for the drinks and included an additional $2.25 undisclosed \"upcharge for each cheap well margarita with strawberry flavor...  The food is honestly disgusting at Zipps... the onion rings come out dark brown falling apart with the cheapest batter Ive ever witnessed, the $8.99 burger comes out on a cheap deformed tiny bun you could buy at a gas station...  I complained to the manager that the burger had decomposing lettuce on it... we also explained to two waitresses and the dickhead manager that we were overcharged for drinks and 3 times they made us wait for the check...  Each time they returned and refused to correct the full price drinks from happy hour... this manager has no authority yet when we left them with ZERO tip for their dishonesty I saw them adjusting the bill to get their tip out of the cash we paid... over $50 for the worst food... My husband stopped at circle K for 1000Mg Tums on the way home from this dirty poorly run tempe location.  They offered us a coupon for a future visit... we will never return to ANY Zipps location. The manager is a total douchebag that would not even take $5 off the bill or correct the terrible food production from their lame kitchen.. I am reporting them to the health inspector because you can get food poisoning at this location... It is THAT BAD....   But by all means check out the deplorable service, crappy food and horrible management and staff for yourself if you like living dangerously at Zipps which makes sense cause you get zero quality food, zip nada zilch for service and they lie to you and try to pad the bill.... then the manager comes over and tells you they agree with the waitress and rip you off... lovely...   This restaurant is the worst Ive ever eaten at in AZ period.  I would not give them even one star... Why? Because they have no business being in the hospitality industry with their negative attitudes, lack of ethic and cheap tactics...  Buyer beware... go to PF Changs, Gordon Biersch or any reputable restaurant that can afford quality food... and to hire an actual staff.,..  this place sucks!",

We walked up and done the street and settled on here for something to eat.  We were on a little tourist strip so I expected mediocre food at an inflated price.  I had:  A Firecracker Margarita - small but tasty A Black & Blue Burger w Bacon - Delicious! Perfectly cooked and very tasty I ordered half fries and half onion rings with my burger - thanks to the waitress for telling us that this was an option when I hesitated on choosing A Pint of Ranger  A Runner brought our food and my order only had fries.  Our waitress came right behind the runner to check on our order and when I told her I was missing my rings she very quickly had a whole basket of hot rings out and on the table.  Good job!  I enjoyed my entire meal and the best part was it came to $19.99 which I think was a great deal for a specialty drink, a pint of beer, a burger and a side.  Bottom Line:  If I'm nearby again, I'll walk around that area and be sure to stop there when I get hungry and/or thirsty.",

    "text": "Ok, maybe I am feeling some type of way because I am not an AZ local, and the people that come here are, hence the less than stellar reviews. I went here for the AZ playoff game against Carolina. This place was freakin PACKED. Luckly we got a seat at the bar.   There are plenty of TV's to go around, matter of fact, there are enough TV's for all of Mill Ave. This is a great place to watch an NFL game (unless it is the Cards losing to the Panthers). Fortunately, I wasn't partial to who won the game, I just wanted to see a good football game.   One thing that I would have to say is the food is damn good (great bar food) especially the wings, fries, and cheese sticks. As busy as it was, the bartender (I think her name was Amy - she is a Niners Fan) was SO ON POINT it was crazy. I don't care if you doubled the amount of people in this bar, she was working the entire bar like she owned the damn place - super impressive.   As well, the restaurant portion was packed too. There were families there, singles, couples, everyone! This is definitely a diverse crowd!   Sometimes, people lose sight on how hard people work at a place like this, it is busy and the servers are working their asses off trying to make sure everyone is taken care of. I will give you a few hints, say please, thank you, and tip well, the likelihood of you having an poor experience will go down exponentially. If you want to act like you are a two year old that can't find their bottle, you will get treated accordingly.   When I come back to AZ, I will definitely hit up Zipps, it definitely grew on me, fun place, loud, and a good time.",

I mentioned to the bartender who then came back and told me that the manager said that the next time I should order my burger without the bun being toasted. Eye roll here.

    "text": "Food and drinks are great, service sucks. I came here with a large group of coworkers to celebrate someone making a career move. This group has a bad habit of not making reservations, but they did this time and we got a great seatting arrangement in the very front of the restaurant where no one could miss us right when you walk in which was perfect as people would come a go throughout the hours that we were there.  When my husband and I arrived, we found seats and started being social. After about 15 minutes, we saw the waitress come by to bring the check for a couple of people (we were late because we were waiting out a flash food alert up in PV). We made eye contact and held the menu in our hands to indicate our interest in ordering. We weren't too hungry and we were having fun so we were patient and understanding that she might just be super busy at this moment. After doing that for about 20 minutes, happy hour was coming to an end and we wanted to throw in our order before that happened so we went up to the bar to order. They got pissy with us, but when we explained the 40 minute wait, they worked with us and told us to continue the order and cash out with her.   Some time later, we were still having fun and I wanted another drink. I snapped out of my conversation and noticed that it had been an hour with not as much as a water refill so I started making direct eye contact with the waitress again and trying to speak with her when she would pass. When that didn't work I went back to the bartender so see if we could cash out there. He told us he would get her attention and a couple minutes later our bills were at the table without as much as a word from the waitress when she dropped it off. She did however take the time to write \"Thanks! \" on the bill.   I will happily admit that I can't stand Mill or most of Tempe for that matter and I was already not happy to be treking down south to a college town, but I wanted to send my friend off right so I sucked it up, paid for parking, and was extra careful to watch out for student driving and homeless people. This rating doesn't just apply to the Tempe location. I went to the Scottsdale one in my part of town and didn't have this bad of experience, but the staff was slow and seemed to be bothered by our orders.   The food is great though so I'll likely return and not put up a fuss next time someone wants to go here. I will however start being more honest with my tips since this is directly a wait staff problem. In summation, if you want amazing drinks, good food, and can put up with bad service come to Zipps and have a zipparita cause they are the best.",

Two dinners came and out and we were told the pizza the other two ordered would be right out. 20 minutes later the manager came over and said I'm so sorry how you ordered your pizza can not be ordered that way. Excuse me it took you 30 mins to decide my pizza could not be made? Ok so we changed the way we ordered it to the manager, 10 mins later the manager came back and said no we can not do it like that either. The pizza we ordered was ordered before at a zipps, not this zipps but a zipps. We were highly upset and said fine just give us pepperoni. 40 mins later still no pizza. I was pissed. I told the manager I was very unhappy and he looked me straight in the face and asked why. OMG are you kidding me. Over an hour and a half and still no pizza and you ask why. We came in before the big game to beat the crowd, the kitchen and manager messing around made us late for everything else we were doing this evening. I can give my money to a lot of other companies on Mill ave. I chose you and I am very sorry I did. I did go up to the kitchen manager and asked where our pizza was he said you realize we are on a 45 min turn around on food. Really I've been here an hour and If you messed up my food wouldn't it go to the front of the line. Our managers name was Chris. The manager then refuse to give us his name. The bill comes and we were charged the price of the dressing from the first pizza which they said to put on the side. This place is ridiculous. I can not believe the disrespect to customers.",

    "text": "So where do I begin... I have personally been involved in the customer service industry for over ten years and never in my life have I experienced worse treatment by an individual and an establishment towards a customer... EVER! I am not one to write reviews, positive or negative, but I literally felt morally obligated to say something about this absolute monster you have as a manger by the name of Dominic.   I was here yesterday (7/8/18) with a party 4... As I am writing this review I think I should have rather just dealt with the tempe police department instead... After waiting for almost TWO HOURS for our food to come one of my friends got up to go to the restroom and walked by the kitchen to look for our food because it was starting to get ridiculous... As she was peering into the kitchen, the \"manager\", Dominic verbally harassed my friend. Yelling at her, telling her do NOT look into the kitchen and stating something along the lines of \"your food will be ready when its ready\" My friend was almost in tears due to sheer embarrassment from being berated from this jerk.. Our server, Francesca, was great. She was apologetic throughout the entire experience... After her manager yelled at my friend our server Francesca came over to the table and apologized for his actions claiming that it isn't slightly uncommon for him to act in such a way towards customers and employees... It was clear to me that the food runner had forgot our food and left it under a heat lamp because the wings were soggy, the burger ordered was cold, and even the ranch had changed from white color to dark yellow... it was disgusting. Dominic came over to our table to offer an \"apology\" but instead of apologizing he just said we weren't allowed near the kitchen and that he never yelled at anyone.... not only did he offer us no sympathy or discounts of any sort (we actually got overcharged on the bill), he called his own server and my friend a liar and just kept arguing with us... Absolutely disgusting that they allow someone like that to work in a \"customer-service\" industry... Guy belongs in jail not in a kitchen working the food business....   I will always tell my horror story of Zipps sports bar in tempe. Way to go Dom on losing a customer for life and scaring half your staff. You are a monster and deserve to be treated accordingly.",

We sat ourselves and my friend had her head resting on her hand because we were tired and hot from our long day. After about 7 minutes of waiting for a server to greet us the manger came over and said he wanted to refuse us service for being too intoxicated. I politely asked if we could just order food and he said no. We asked for waters and none were brought to us. When asking to talk to a manager for the second time I decided to take our service elsewhere. We walked across the street and had some great pizza and wings at Mellow Mushroom where we were served with no problems. When being picked up by our Uber I asked if we seemed to drunk to be served food and replied \"if you were too drunk you wouldn't be in my car right now\". This just shows that we were all in good states. I will never take my business to Zipps again after being treated so poorly. And it is illegal to deny someone of water. This situation was handled very poorly.",

I ordered my usual margarita with their house tequila and was very good. I browsed through their menu and came across their burrito (which appeared to be a new item on the menu). It consisted of chicken, cilantro, corn, black beans all in a tortilla with guac/sour cream/salsa on the side. Boy was this good! Extremely tasty and the combination of all the ingredients was very well put together. Something I never would expect to have at a bar.  I loved the fact that I did not feel extremely full as the items in the burrito were actually not all that bad for you. You have to try it. Never been to ZIPPS or been a fan, but guess what, I am now. I will be returning soon!  On a side note, the bar stools were a bit uncomfortable. I hardly have this problem (as I my cushion helps prevent this). Next time, I won't be sitting on them for a long period of time as they are a bit uncomfortable.",

Making that extra fifty cents to make me feel taken advantage of is silly when we already have a tab of well over $100.  I love this place but this seems petty and makes me feel unimportant and not valued as a customer.",

I was completely satisfied with the food and the service. Next time we are in Arizona we will be sure to come back.",

I would like upper management and corporate to take notice of BETTY'S (the new manager) appalling unprofessional behavior towards me and four others on a dinner outing. Being new to town, I was excited to be highly recommended to Zipps. Our service was less then mediocre, our food orders were wrong, along with drinks. Not to mention the extra wait time for everything! Our waitress knowing there were few mistakes made, she reassured the manager would come by to consult us. BETTY showed up with a child-like $5 voucher for one mistaken food order then went on to tell my friend.. it was his fault his order was wrong and it took over an hour!?? Whaat!? There was No explanation for any other poor performance. Final straw was when kindly challenged by her decision making she rudely said we were done and told us to leave! Smh! BETTY ruined my 1st experience at Zipps and I don't plan on going back. I really hope this issue is assessed.",

We were told that the food wait-time was about 45 minutes, but everything came out way faster than that. We just got wings and some chips and salsa, but the wings were perfect like the other Zipps locations. Ashley was always present and took good care of us. Definitely recommend to anyone craving some sports bar food (and cheap drinks).",

    "text": "I moved to the area two years ago and discovered this place and loved it right off the bat.  However over that time things have really gone downhill especially at the Tempe location.  To start, the manager is problematic.  Here's the story - I'm from Back East and where I'm from only one condiment goes on wings and it is bleu cheese.  When I started going to Zipps they had the best in the area.  At some point they decided to replace it with ranch with crumbles on top.  Why?  Who knows but it's the case at every location.  So my colleagues and I went there for lunch one day about a year ago and I order the buffalo chicken salad and specified that I wanted bleu cheese on it.  It came drenched in ranch - my colleagues all tried it and agreed it was definitely not bleu cheese.  I asked the waitress to take it back and she gave us the impression that she had heard this complaint a number if times.  Then something happened I've never seen before - the manager brought me back the same dish, put it back in front of me and insisted it was bleu cheese.  I disagreed and he offered a solution to the dispute by saying \"I can bring you the container and you'll see it says bleu cheese.\"  I thought I had transported into the scene from Tommy Boy where he talks about slapping a guarantee on the box - it has to be your bull.  Look, if you want to replace your bleu cheese with inferior product just go ahead and do it, but don't lie to your customers when they call you out on your BS.  I'm not sure if there is some sort of bleu cheese shortage or Mr. Valentine from Trading Places is driving the cost up on the commodities market or something but it just makes you look like a fool when you try to tell your customers something like that.    Another time we had a group of about 8 getting together to watch the ACC tournament - five of us got there earlier than the other 3 so we pushed two hi-tops together.  The manager came over and said he could not \"give up\" the table.  Bear in mind the one we grabbed was closest to the door and multiple groups had looked at it and walked out the door instead of sitting there but he could not afford to let us take such a money maker.  Also, we were clearly dressed professionally and were obviously ready to drop a siginficant amount of money watching 4 hours of hoops.  Anyway....he asked us when the other 3 were going to show and I said like 20 minutes.  He said he could \"give\" me 15, then came over after 5 and moved the table back while our collective jaws hit the floor.  When the next guy came, he sat alone at that table, ordered nothing but water and we proceeded to talk loudly between the tables to mock what was going on until the other two arrived and we were \"allowed\" to abscond with the table.  Our waitress was even laughing at how stupid the whole thing was. Except for what has become known amongst my friends as The Bleu Cheese Incident I've never seen such unprofessional behavior from someone in the service industry.  Too bad because for a sports bar the food is pretty good, the beers are always cold and its a convenient place to go before or after a movie at the AMC nearby.  In this day and age, however, service is everything and this place fails decidedly on that count.",

Even tho it's crazy hot, they have an awesome misting system on the patio, so we made a dive for the last open table. Happy hour was ending, but we were able to order a zipparita just before, and kept them coming. These are definitly not weak, (limit of 3), and just as good as the chandler location. For food, we kinda went crazy with the apps. We ordered the chicken skewers,  mozz sticks, extra hot wings, and chips, salsa and guacamole. My friends ordered the BBQ burger, BLT and Greek salad. I tried to be healthy,(after the apps, what was the point?:), and ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, with jalapenos, and with a side salad. It was pretty good, I would definitly order this again with cheese! Friendly server also. Can't wait to go back:)",

They replaced with a bun without asking.  - The food took more than an hour to come out. - one sandwich was forgotten. After mentioning it twice, 1/2 hour after everyone else got their food, a manager finally came out to ask if we'd gotten it (we hadn't). He never said I'm sorry - just said, \"I'll check.\" - The food was gross.  Most meals were in edible. The nachos were terrible - had a pool of grease left at the bottom.  - The drinks were so weak, we watched the bartender pour.  He did put one splash of alcohol - not even close to a shot pour.  We demanded new drinks.   - After a comprehensive discussion about splitting the bill three ways before ordering, one bill was delivered.  The waitress proceeded to ask all the same questions as before, but had each of us review what we ate.  - 4 of 6 in our group said its the worst meal we've had in a long time, if not ever. No apologies were ever given and definitely no offers of a comping a single item.. We will never ever eat at Zipps again. Yuk!",

Instead of hiring great managers and great people, they must have fired eveyone in training with a brain cause the management here is overrated.    They need to be fired and replaced.   I have given this place 3 official visits for drinks and food and a few times for drinks each time something wasn't quite right.    First the opened the new place understaffed,  unlike most places who open overstaffed and weed out the bad employees.    They decided to open in March, Arizona's busiest month with Spring Training and they open the week of March Madness.       The bar seats 30 plus people around a huge horseshoe bar plus about 200 general seating, there was only one  bartender working and one covering the well.    They needed 2 more bartenders,  I waited 10 minutes to get greeted and another 5 mintues for a water and beer,  then took 15 minutes for all three guys on my side to order.    The food came in 20-25 minutes a bit long for just wings, but the wings were good as always.   Good to see they brought the same golden sauce from their other locations.  Order the wings if you want to be happy here.   Next visit - the place was half empty and service at a table sucked we came in at 7pm and wanted to catch an 8pm movie at the new AMC Centerpointe.   Of course we told our waitress and ordered right away , but food took over 30 minutes.    We only ordered chicken fingers and wings.   The breading on the chicken fingers was a bit soggy and heavy.   The beer batter is too much.     Last visits we had the worst Manager on the planet give us attitude about walking by the bar on the way to the bathroom.   They don't have any signs at sight level saving the area is off limits , they need to add some swinging doors.    His name was Jason, but frankly all the managers I dealt with or spoke with that night had the same attitude that they didn't care much.   They were too busy to care about giving good service.     I will avoid this bar,   hopefully the summer kills them and they close within a few years,  like Uno's before them or Tavern down the street.   I would rather go see the dbags at el Hefe that support bad management.    This place is to be avoided , try any other place on Mill.   or another location of Zipps in town.",

They combine the screens together to make one big screen so I watch my Bears at home and then watch them shitty raiders with him lol jk I'm an Honorary fan for the homies. The girls are always friendly and wear football jerseys during the season and it's always fun to watch games. I'm a little drunk doing this review but fuck it I'll take an Uber home  so shout out to the girls and the management!. Caleigh is always helpful to me. She's been my waitress for a long time. The other waitress Cierra is cool as well. Ask for the waitresses Britaney and Malisia. They usually wait on me as well and are always helpful. Also NO SURPRISE ZIPPS. You have a drunk being annoying as shit complaining to his friends about a stupid play when I come on a regular basis. It was effecting the girls working because it was right next to their station. So they get the manager and the manager goes \"well what do you expect this is a sports bar\" hahahahaha I expect you to have some balls and say something before a fight breaks out you idiot. You have loyal customers like me that are trying to go and enjoy the game and you can't be bothered. That's disgusting bro.   Update: I want to thank the GM Devin for taking the time to personally apologize about that situation as well as Tiffany from their corporate. I will be returning because they are handling the situation",

    "text": "For some reason my review didn't post last Sunday..  To start off any time I've been to this location service is not the best but last time I brought a friend from out of town to give it one last chance.   Bartender was rude to start with seems like she was having a bad day and or overwhelmed, we waited a good 10 minutes before someone came and got our drink order and another 5 just to get them.  After getting our drinks we wanted to put food in and asked for menus and never got them so waiting another 20 minutes just to try and put a order in after having to look the menu up on our phones.  I and my friend put in a appetizers, I got the pretzel and she got mozzarella sticks. Then we put our order in. Never in my life seen such a nightmare.  Another 35-40 minutes go by and our apps haven't made it out yet. Me as a server I let me customers know if the kitchen is running behind. So we stopped one the bar tenders and asked her she went and checked said it should be another 15-20 for the appetizers and another 30-40 for your food. Our appetizers came out right after we talked to her, my cheese was already hard because you can tell it was sitting there for awhile and the pretzels were hard like a rock, the mozzarella sticks were hot but at this point we're hungry, so I don't even touch the pretzels and I tell the bar tender and she brings it back pretzels still hard if not harder from trying to warm them up and the cheese all crusty around the edge.   So are burgers come out I order a turkey burger no bun and the other bartender told me about the lettuce wrap so I ordered that, doesn't come out with it and I told her it's no bun and lettuce wrap and she has the never to just put it down and bring my ONE SLICE of lettuce, wasn't even the right burger. My friends burger came out completely wrong so they brought it back another 20 minutes goes by before I can tell the girl that my food is wrong, at this point we're both frustrated and not happy, so her food gets to her and they bring her my meal.  No manager got involved and we were treated badly and was uncalled for. I didn't touch any of my food minus a bit or the burger and one pretzels and still charged for both, at this point I just wanted my check and to leave.  I will not be going back to this location every again they should think about get more uppy girls and not so rude and or better managers to actually get involved with the customers.",

The other time, my boyfriend and I had about 40 minutes to kill before our movie, so we walked over to get a quick bite. We put our order in and it took 27 minutes to bring out one burger with fries and onion rings. There were maybe 7 other tables and a few people at the bar, but all of them (except for like one other) had food at their table, so cooking one burger should have been quick. We had to leave as soon as they brought the food out, so we ended up not eating and left. I even tried to pay the bill before the food was out because of our need to leave as soon as we were done eating. It was just a disappointment, and we will not be going back as we don't see a third time being any kind of charm.",

It's been a while since I've been to Zipps and according to my first review the wings were great, however not this time. It was terrible! We ordered 5 baskets of wings and only ONE was a good batch. My husband bit into his first chicken and it was RAW. We flagged down our waitress and said this chicken is still raw and instead of her actually taking the time to look at the chicken she said \"oh no, the chicken is never raw\" and walked away. My husband and I looked and each other with confusion. Then my sister bit into hers and there was still blood in her chicken! I flagged down the host and asked for a manager and/or our waitress again. Once again our waitress came and said no it's cooked and called the manager over. The manager said it's not raw because their chicken comes pre-cooked, packaged and frozen. It's obvious according to the picture I took the chicken is still raw. Service was so slow, but understandable because the place was packed for the game, but don't tell me the chicken is cooked when its obvious that it's raw!",

Food took a long time to arrive but it was worth it. I ordered the Zipps golden chicken, and it was amazing! I think I ordered it spicy because it was really spicy (bartender warned me), but it was still great!   Would go there again with friends just to chill and watch a game.",

    "text": "I went to this bar while on a college tour with my daughter on Thursday and it was nice so we decided to return but when we did we had a totally different experience. Our server was a young lady who totally screwed up our order. We ordered Nachos but we're brought out chips and salsa and when we informed her the waitress that she had order wrong she got upset with us and tried to convince us we ordered chips and salsa instead. We then refused the chips and then she informed us that we order both chips and salsa and Nachos which makes no sense. She was upset and stormed away, we then was waiting on our complete order which was Nachos, and two order of wings. It took a very long time for order to come out so we told a waitress to please cancel our order then we begin to leave. While walking out with my daughter still hungry three guys literally ran out as soon as we stepped out of the restaurant and told us that we didn't pay for our order and tried to make me Pat for something we never received and was rude in front of my daughter. I then begin to get pissed and told the 3 guys that not only was we not going to pay for a meal that we never received, we were not ever going to revisit because of bad service. One of the guys two of the guys then said we order chips and salsa and didn't pay for it as well, the same chips and salsa we sent back the guys brought back up and said that we ordered them and we know it, in a very rude way and all in front of my daughter who's a minor. I tinformed the guys that we did not order the chips nor did we receive our food and we cancelled the order well before it came out and by the way they knew the order have not came out because as they were trying to intimidate me into paying for an order we didn't receive they told me that the order was almost ready and I need to pay. Now not only did I cancel because order still was not out bug the 3 guys still hadn't brought out an order that was ready even to try to satisfy us but instead carried on about me paying for something they knew we didn't receive and was still not prepared. I told them I'm not paying and to tone down their voices in front of my daughter, then one of the guys begin to go back and forth with me about me not canceling the order and I should pay and remember the food still was not out. It was when one of the guys said he understood after all the arguing right out in front of the establishment. After all of the confusion and just as we were walking off one of the guys stated that j needed to pay because I didn't cancel the order and begin again to raise his voice and that's when I raised mine and stated again I wasn't paying and he needed to watch his tone in front of my daughter who witnessed this madness. In all we didn't receive our food and we were harassed about paying for food we never received and our waitress lied on us stating we never canceled even know that food had never came out and it was everest told it was ready. They are terrible with their service and try to make you pay even when you cancel and never receive your food. I would not recommend this place but it's a business and I to am a business owner so I suggest that you experience for your self and judge because that was my experience which j felt we were also targeted. The most rude out of the three guys was the black guy, and the other two were white so I think the black guy had something to prove by being extra rude even after the other two had apologized for the problem.",

With Zipp's being a sports bar I thought it would be somewhat similar to Buffalo Wild Wings in terms of the food and drinks. While the atmosphere was fine and it was nice to sit at the patio outside, the food had to be some of the worst that we had.  Both the fries and onion rings were extremely overcooked to the point where we could not even finish it. As for the chicken sandwich it was borderline inedible and it was a struggle to finish. My friend ordered a burger and ushered pretty much the same thoughts to me about his meal, He did finish his burger though but certainly not without a struggle.  The drinks were fine but it would not be worth coming back here due to the terrible food. I'm sure going to Buffalo Wild Wings would have actually been a better choice for the evening.",

It's very sad to see that the manager is stiffing the guests with the pours on beer, makes me wonder what else they stiff on.  Ordered a Michalobe Ultra and it came to me with at least an inch of beer missing from the top. And it came the second and third again like that. I started watching the drinks being served by the manager and they all had the same shitty pour. I sent the first one back and the said there is nothing they can do because the manager yells at them for that. Not proper.  Thx",

    "text": "I've never thought very highly of this establishment, but the main reason I'm giving such a low review is due to a very frustrating experience during my last visit.  I will start my review with what I think of the place overall. The food is mediocre at best and sometiemes comes out cold, leaving you wondering why it costs 2x more than most nearby places serving similar--but cheaper and higher quality--items (e.g. five guys, jimmy johns, etc.). The service varies from good to very poor. The only redeeming quality I found is the enormous and plentiful TVs on which to watch your favorite sport, as well as the lively ambiance, especially during important sporting events.  Now I'd like to detail my last experience, which is the main reason that I will never again give this place my business. I visited Zipps with a few friends in January 2016 for an NFL playoff game. The bad part began when halfway into the game I started to feel very sleepy due to lack of sleep the night before. I would have simply paid for my food and driven home if I had not been assigned designated driver for our group that day, so I decided to escape the loudness of the bar by moving to a table just outside, on their patio, a few feet from where my friends were watching the game. I figured I'd put my head down and rest my eyes at one of the many open tables on the patio (most customers were sitting inside watching the game) while my friends enjoyed the rest of the game, but about a minute into closing my eyes I was startled by an aggressive push on my shoulder and opened my eyes to a man standing over me, loudly and rudely telling me that I can't sleep out there. He then tried to tell me to leave. I understand that bars watch out for people who are sleeping because this means they may have had too much to drink; however, I wasn't even drinking and regardless of whether or not I was intoxicated it was an incredibly rude way for an employee to address a customer. He tried to get me to leave as if I was an unwanted freeloader using their tables for sleep, but I told him, much to his disbelief, that I was a paying customer and then went over and joined my friends inside. At this point I was incredibly frustrated by the way I was treated but decided not to complain or do anything about it so as not to create an awkward situation for my friends who were still enjoying the game.  A little while later, as we were watching the 4th quarter, we noticed a homeless man wandering from table to table, being loud and belligerent and asking customers for money and cigarettes. He eventually made his way to our table and started talking to us, asking for money and cigarettes and making crass jokes. We wanted to ask him to leave so we could get back to watching our game but were intimidated by his large stature and obvious state of inebriation. We also didn't ask him to leave because we figured that was up to the employees/bouncers. The bouncers were definitely keeping an eye on him but even after an hour of him making customers visibly uncomfortable they never did anything. By the end of the game he finally left on his own, without purchasing anything.  I just found it so ironic that while he was not a paying customer who was clearly intoxicated and belligerent, the management completely left him alone. Meanwhile, I was a paying customer just minding my own business and yet I was the one who was harassed and treated like I shouldn't be there. I think the bouncers were too afraid to confront this man who rivaled them in physical strength but since I was much smaller than them they felt it was okay to treat me poorly.  I complained to some employees as we were leaving, letting them know how I was treated outside and that we were disappointed the bouncers didn't do their job when it actually mattered. They looked at me as if I was stupid for complaining and simply justified their actions. They basically said the employee was justified in rudely telling me to leave since I could have been intoxicated while also justifying the bouncers actions by saying that the belligerent man left on his own anyway (mind you, this was after over an hour of harassing customers). At this point I realized just how pointless it was to complain since they care so little about their customers and just decided my best course of action would be to leave and never give them my business again--and that's what I did. I haven't been their in months and I feel great about it. There are much better places to get a beer and watch the game anyway.",

The salad was taken back to the kitchen but my friend was still being charged for it. When she refused to pay for a salad she didn't eat, they called the cops on her.

    "text": "So I received a promotion and joined a new real estate brokerage. My buddies who were as as follow 1. Director of risk/fraud department 2. Computer programer for a risk/fraud department 3. Manager of a risk/fraud department and me.  When it was time to go I asked for the bill and it to be split 4 ways (unfortunately earlier in the day I had been a victim of fraud myself and my bank account had virtually been cleaned out). I received a regular bill for $24.87 and my buddies received their regular bills. While walking out the door my wife called to let me know that our account was almost drained. Because of the fraud I thought nothing of Zipps but was concerned that my server would not get her tip amount. I tracked her down to offer a different form of tip. At this point she said \"Sorry\" I'm like, no its my fault, but here have some money. She's like no, I ran your bill for $128, but it will come off as soon as we batch. So, I'm like okay let me talk to your manager real quick so I can get a receipt for my records. He came over half hearted(if barely) apology and refused stating it would be cleared up when he batched that night ( I knew it would not, remember by former employment and company? It takes 3-5 days for an ACH return), He gave a card that said \"Manager\" but when I looked her up on social media it was a 18-20 year old college student that works at Zipps. I woke up this morning and left several messages going from calm to relativity angry (see I can take ownership for my actions). About an hour ago a got a call from accounting or management (claims) and said it would clear up over the weekend and they were sorry (but it felt very forced).  After telling her with my background that their might be options to fix it by doing this or that with her hypercom she refused and went back to the script. So, finally I did ask for $100 gift card for my time and troubles (see honesty is not that hard) again NO! So I said fine, I would let you all at YELP decide, she said she did not appreciate my \"threats\" as you can see they were not. All I want at this point is 1. A sincere apology from someone anyone at Zipps and  2. An admission they handled it poorly and will update their training to do a better job in the future. If they do these things I will retract this and or give 3 stars.  Merry Christmas all and be careful with your bills during this busy time of year!",

The bill comes, my margarita was charged full price.  They were on special saturday before 4.. and was charged for extra sauces.. and it was supposed to come with my order hence the name buffalo shrimp. How can you charge extra for something that is part of the order? Very disappointed.  A call to weights and measures will be made. We wont be back to this location.",

Get over yourselves, the place was empty and the #USA vs #POR wasn't starting for three hours.  Thank you Zipps for making a stressful day in 105 degrees just a little more miserable. Up side went home made delicious shrimp and saved money. If I could give no stars I would today.",

We understand you are crowded, our drinks took a little longer but hey, we only got one and our server was very attentive. However, as we were almost done with our beer, my friend asked me to take a seat really quick because I had an injured ankle and when we sat down literally for 2 mins (even tho we know someone would come and ask us to allow them to clean the table, we just needed a seat for a min) Abby came and rudely began to go on about her 6 page waiting list with attitude asking us to leave the table. Unnecessary to be rude, I have been in the industry for years, that's not the way you speak to a customer. Maybe you should train some off your staff a little better on etiquette.",

When I mentioned it to the manager (Matt), he literally laughed in my face. Another manager came over and rectified it after Matt had his outburst.

I seem to think there are more people when the hockey game is on because of my last visit.   I ordered Zipp's wings, buffalo style-hot. The waitress even asked me if I was sure because they are hot. I should of tried the medium first, lol. It was spicy and hot, but it was that kind of spicy-hot that you just wanted to keep eating over and over because of how good it was. In conclusion, I was a big fan of their wings.  I wish I would've gotten the name of our waitress. She had a trainee with her, but both were great because I'm pretty big on having my drinks refilled with having to wait a whole life time and they were good at making sure my water was filled.   Only downside was  happy hour on the weekends. I mean Mon-Fri their happy hour specials is something you can't go wrong on, but weekends I feel not much variety and the 11am-4pm then 8pm-close is ok., Overall, food was good, company was good, service was good. All good.",

The food quality was also poor, with extremely greasy overcooked wings, and lukewarm fries.  After reading the other reviews here, it's obvious that the parent company GMI Restaurants doesn't care at all about customers.  IF they did, they would have stepped in and put a mature manager in place.  Zipps will never have a penny of my business again, and I'll go out of my way to make sure that all my family and friends avoid Zipps.",

We went to the hostess to be seated, and she saw that we were wearing Cardinals jerseys. We told her there were two of us, so she proceeded to take us to the back room with a view of one tv- one tv, in a sports bar- saying, \"Here you go, the Cardinals game is on this tv!\" We came to a sports bar to watch all the football games? If we just wanted to watch the cardinals game we would've stayed at home. So anyway, we asked to be seated in the front where we could see all the games. She says, \"I need to ask the hostess.\" They then have this whisper session right in front of us and I hear one of them say, \"So should I tell them they can't sit there?\" Keep in mind, the restaurant was EMPTY at this time. We showed up early to get a good seat. She then tells us unfortunately we can't sit at the table we want because they don't want to give \"two tables in a row to the same server\". They obviously didn't care about customer satisfaction, so we will not be returning. And no less than 20 minutes later they sat someone else where we wanted to sit who showed up after us. I do not understand we were denied that table and the next people in could sit there.",

I love it! The menu is easy to read with additions. Zipps known for their Golden wings(delicious) and Zipparitas(limit of 3) but these two together are perfect! I highly recommend.   I had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with blue cheese crumbles with side of sweet potato chips /fries. I literally ate it all! Very fresh and delicious.

    "text": "I had a great experience here. It was a Tuesday afternoon right after the lunch rush. This is a prime location for Zipps. Mill Ave !!! They offer great burgers such as the Zipps Burger and Bacon Burger. Don't forgot their world famous Zipperitas.   Today I went with the Zipp Chop salad. I loved it. I asked for no onion or tomato. Add croutons to make it even better.  For my actual meal I went with an appetizer. The Chicken Skewers. You had a choice of 2 sauces. This is a big dish so if you are with a group this is a good choice to share with everyone. I just used it as a meal. My BF had the pretzels which he wasn't too fond of. He also didn't like the cheese dip. But the shrimp  he loved. This dish has a cool presentation. It came out with the shrimp on ice.   Because this Zipps is located by ASU. (Alumni here) I loved all of the ASU decor. Plus they have an awesome photo of Pat Tillman. There are plenty of TV's and this location has a lot of  open space to walk around and not be so close to other customers. Outdoor seating is also available.   Thank you Zipps! I really enjoyed my meal today.",

    "text": "Showed up here to watch the MLB All Star game with a buddy.  They had music on when I showed up.   Before I even sat down I asked one of the bartenders if they were going to put the sound on for the game.  She disappeared and shortly came back and said yes they would.  Halfway through the national anthem still no sound so I ask the manager himself and he says they only put sound on for the big games like the Super Bowl.  This is after I ordered a beer based on the fact they would have the game and sound on.  I explained to him that I had asked about audio and it had been confirmed prior to sitting down and ordering a drink.  I then had to press him a little more and he agreed to put it on the big screen on the other side of the bar with audio.    I will tip my cap to the manager for getting the audio on for the game but the lack of communication up front created the issue.    My gripe is don't call yourself a \"Sports Grill\" if you don't think the Mid Summer Classic MLB All Star game isn't a big enough game to put the audio on versus bumping pop music over the loud speaker.  Finally I will close with this.  The manager once again created an awkward situation when he walked up behind me while I was writing this review to check on how things were going.  Lookin over my shoulder he said obviously not very well based on your review.   First off who does this and looks over somebody's shoulder at what they are doing on their phone and then confronts them about it.  I told him I would be fair on my review about accommodating me but also include the fact that he was rather intrusive when looking at what I was doing on my phone.  Bottom line don't go to Zipps and expect to have audio for the MLB All Star game and also watch out for managers looking over your shoulder on what you are doing on your personal device.",

    "text": "Lavar the manager literally said the dumbest thing I've ever heard. I asked for a pinot grigio and then asked if I could have it poured into a glass without a stem. I've managed bars for over 12 years and we use glassware without stems because they break less frequently and don't get knocked over on the bar.   Lavar said the company policy is that wine goes in wine glasses and beer goes in beer glasses that way the servers know what's being served. I said, I'm the only one seated at the bar who would be drinking wine, I see beer glasses all down the row. I can tell them what I'm drinking. He said, no, it's company policy.   I didn't want a larger pour, I just wanted a different glass. I was polite when I asked, dressed nicely and completely sober. I have never heard someone defend their own stupidity and a blatant lie like a child for what reason I can not understand other than in today's era, once you lie out loud it becomes someone's truth.   I had been to this location 2 other times, I had enjoyed the servers and both times, 2 different servers accommodated this request before. In fact, hundreds of other bars across the U.S. have accommodated this request for me.   This is not a company policy, this is no one's company policy. He made this up. Again, for what reason I don't know. I do know that this manager is incompetent and angered a customer for absolutely no reason. People who make up \"rules\" like this to seem like they are in power have deeper issues to begin with. Lavar, you manage a bar on Mill Ave., lighten up.   I walked 10 feet out the front door to another bar, ordered the same which they smiled and poured for me, I ordered food, I watched the game. What a stupid reason and a stupid \"manager\" for losing a customer.   There are many other places around the Mill area. Lavar and his fictional policies don't deserve your patronage.",

The wings are great! The corn dogs... well I wouldn't recommend those. But some people may like them I suppose. The reason for not giving 5 stars is because of the smell when you first walk in. It's very musty. Almost smells like a wet rag or dirty mop water. Also the last time we were in there when the bartenders were walking behind the bar you can hear their shoes sticking to the floor which was kind of gross. But overall the experience was fun",

The onion rings tasted like they'd been sitting out for awhile and were hard and flavorless. The rest of my meal was ok just disappointed about the amount of avocado they put in it. But the waitress is really one of the reasons for the rating, she walked away while I was trying to ask her a question, we had to ask for Silver ware, napkins, boxes, bags, refills, etc... the fact that I had to ask two different waitresses for silverware and more napkins is a bit silly.

The only negative I've experienced is that the wait to be seated and to get food/drink refills can be ridiculously long, even when they are seemingly not that busy. This is definitely not somewhere you should come if you're in a hurry.",

    "text": "I was pretty excited to find out they were opening a Zipps in Tempe. There hasn't been a great place to watch sports on MIll Ave so I think this will be a popular spot. It is saturated with TVs which is a good thing I guess.  The food is solid and reasonably priced. They have a good selection of burgers for around $8 with fries (double patty). The fries are just okay but I'd recommend subbing the onion rings if you're in to that sort of thing.   The real draw to this place is their happy hour deals. From 3-7 every weekday they do $3 zipparitas and domestic pints plus some other good deals. There are also specials from 8-close that vary depending on the day.  The first time I went the service was less than great but I've been back and they seem to have worked out the kinks. Zipps is a great place for all; I'd recommend it to pretty much anyone.",

    "text": "i am totally not surprised this place gets low stars. the service is atrocious.  i pushed my friends together and decided to drag them out on a tuesday night. they weren't too keen on the idea of grabbing a beer, but i convinced them  all three of us were out of town-ers.  two from california, one from utah.   the bartender told me that they didn't accept vertical ID's. I told her it was clearly a real ID (the new CA ID's are impossible to counterfeit). I had multiple credit cards, and even a medical insurance as well as car insurance  card to prove that I was indeed the person on the ID card. Bartender said no, I said let me speak to the manager.   the manager took his time getting over to us, i watched him from behind the bar. i remember his name to be deshawn, but i could be wrong.  i explained to him that i was from out of town, had my credit cards, my insurance card and my medical insurance card. it was clear I was sober and not looking to create a fuss, just was trying to have a beer. instead of making the manager decision that it was totally appropriate to serve me, he tells me he will need to \"call the hire ups\". AS IF I WANT TO WASTE ANYMORE TIME WAITING AROUND TO FIND OUT IF I WAS APPROVED. so i left. went to the nearest bar, next door had a great time there. the manager on duty who was also the bouncer informed me that he wasn't allowed to accept vertical ID's, but since i was clearly sober and very clearly the person on the ID that stated i was 2-fricking-3 years old, there would be no issue.  I had a wonderful time at the bar next door, i believe it was called the handle bar. don't waste your time with incompetent managers who can't make decisions for the facility themselves. please. that is your job, to manage and make decisions when your boss isn't around, not so you can take your time calling someone for a question you can clearly handle yourself.   to the manager - i told you i would be writing a yelp review, and i think it's pretty atrocious that you don't seem to care about what people say publicly about your business. you could have been much more apathetic or apologetic, instead you made my friends and I upset and lost money.",

I had the chicken fingers w/ fries and onion rings.  Tasted good but the whole thing was very greasy.  I had a couple of rum/cokes too.  The dinner never really sat well and mid-way through the event I had some intestinal distress which lasted a couple days.  Not sure if I am just not used to greasy bar food, the alcohol compounded the issue the food was somehow bad.  I will never know because no one else was I'll and I never felt feverish or horrific.  Just not a nice dining experience which is a shame because the staff was very attentive and courteous, the service fast and always nice to watch MNF on multiple screens.",

That's all very nice because this place has a good atmosphere for that (hence the two stars).   But the food is not so great. I had the Mushroom Swiss burger (medium rare) with onion rings. And it was the GREASIEST burger and onion rings I have ever tasted. You can see grease dropping from the burger. I felt kind of sick when I'm half way through so I had to stop.   Basically, if you just want to grab a beer with your friends, then you are ok. But if you really want some quality food, I would not recommend this place.",

She was a cute, energetic, brown haired, slim gal w a pearly white smile who said, \"I would just die if you lost your money!\" Im pretty sure her name was Erica (I was a bit under the influence).

I got to zipps a bit early and the waitress seemed to be to busy to worry about me. To be completely honest there I am pretty sure the waitresses outnumbered the guests since it was like 515 on a Tuesday afternoon. I finally waved down a waitress and got my beer order in. after my friend got there waved the waitress down again to get her a beer. The worst part of this I had to keep waving them down while they were just chatting with co workers. We had a couple beers and as we tried to get the check, my friend got tired of waving at the waitress who we both could have sworn was looking right at us as we were waving, and went up to the servers booth and asked her for the check. It was pretty redonkulous, im hoping it was just a \"off day\" for them since this is one of the places I like to visit while on mill ave.",

One of our out of town business guests decided this would be a nice place to take a dozen of us from my office.  It's been awhile since I've been in a Zipps. But based on my past experiences, the service or the food tend to be uneven.  I wasn't disappointed.   We found the food to be pretty good. But we were somewhat disappointed with the mixed drinks. The wait times for a Monday around five-thirty were dismal.  The place was empty, we were it. Thankfully, we chilled, while watching some games on their many HDTVs  After waiting ten minutes or more, my drink arrived - not anyone else's, just mine. I don't know how you would water down a Long Island, but it was definitely weak.  The service for the most part was both good and bad.  Again, moments of confusion and disorganization, with either of our food or drink orders.   I'll give it a generous laid back Three Stars.",

    "text": "Ok so this is a sports bar right in the center hub of all the ASU activity and campus. I get it. So let's talk positives. One of the personnel was very kind and very quick to change a TV specifically to a game we wanted to watch. To our credit we chose a section that was in an alcove and a TV no one was watching. We didn't want to hijack a TV from the crowd . So thank you very much for facilitating that for us. THANK YOU. Food: Stay away from the pizza and from the pretzel bites- horrid and even worse than a middle school cafeteria. I mean seriously bad. French fries and onion rings would of been good  had they been hot. Cook time to server retrieval is slow. Quit socializing at the hostess stand and stay on top of your tables and maybe the food will be hot. The wings are actually very good - I give credit where credit is due. Good wings!!!! Now for the kicker. We ordered Moscow Mules - not  Dessert Donkeys  You're artistic spin on the mule is not what we asked for. After sending the drinks back to be correctly done a manager came over- granted ASU had just played football and I'm sure he had a banging day but now as it was quiet and slower he comes over ( ponytail, glasses) and sternly huffs and puffs and says he will not cancel the drink order it was made as we requested and too bad ( paraphrasing)  He very quickly learned that as nice as I am I do have an edge and was schooled in the ways of consumer demand very quickly Needless to say the drink was corrected and he slinked off. Hey sport...the ASU kids may not know the difference but parents who have paid for their kids college educations do live in a world of paying for quality and not listening to your crap about what you will or will not do. Listen up and keep your job don't piss off the ice cream man he won't come down your street and he will tell others to do the same!",

But we ordered a pizza that was supposed \"New York style\".  Being from New York I can tell you it was nowhere near New York style. But we are in Arizona so that's understandable. My husband and son each took a slice to try it. They immediately realized that it was not good. It had way too much cheese on it. So much that it was inedible. One of the floor managers came over and asked how the meal was and my husband told him straight up that there was too much cheese. He actually agreed and said that they put about 30% too much cheese on. He agreed that they messed up. He said they think they are doing a good thing but they're actually not.  They couldn't eat anymore. We later asked if they could take the pizza off the bill which any decent restaurant would always do. You could clearly see that the pie was not eaten except for those two slices that they had to try to find out that the food was  not good quality. Instead of taking it off the bill they offered us zips bucks. When we asked why the manager said that it was their policy that they couldn't take it off the bill because the customer had tried the food!!!    How else would you know how bad the quality was if you don't try it? The pie cost $18 and they gave us $10 worth of zips bucks and we will never return to this location. Terrible service.",

That aside, food was pretty mediocre. This is my first time at a Zipps and I love chicken wings so we landed on coming here to also watch the game. I guess I should've asked for the wings before the rest of the food cause it took forever! We were sitting for over an hour and a half before we got our food.  I ordered the cheese bacon burger, my husband got the pb & j burger, and then our roommate got the fish and chips. My burger was really juicy and I didn't realize they all come with double patties so that was a HUGE shocker! Really couldn't get my mouth around it to be honest, but it was really good. I was so disappointed in the floppy soggy fries though.   I will say though, we got the golden wings and they were AWESOME. Super delicious, crispy, and flavorful. All in all, service was poor, fries sucked, but burgers & wings hit the spot :)",

The worst part about this place is the staff. I have never met more horrible, disgusting people in my life. Also, beware of the dirty blonde waitress with gages, she is a terrible, awful human being. Only go to this place if you like horrible food and want to be treated like shit. I will never go to zipps again. This is actually my least favorite restaurant and I don't think I have ever written a yelp review before, but I had to this time because of how much this place sucks.",

    "text": "Located in the heart of downtown Tempe, this classic bar and grill spot is ideal for lunch! I think a way to tell apart a good bar and grill is how they prepare chicken tenders. So yes I had the chicken tenders meal with onion rings. Really impressed with how quickly the meal came out. Something about the breading that was very unique. The light batter on the chicken tenders flavors really came out! The onion rings were not full of bread crumbs and the onions itself did not have that slimy flavor.  I really had no complaints and a recommendation to have a better selection of local brews. All in all a pleasant experience that will be making my way back soon!",

My boyfriend and I came by for dinner and he would give Zipps 10 stars if you asked him. He loves their wings, beer pretzel bites, and IPAs.  Beware that their fries are not thick. I am super picky because I love potato wedges or at least when French fries taste like potatoes lol. Skinny twigs are not my jam, sorry. Aaaaanywho, my turkey club sandwich was delicious.   Our hostess was sweet and friendly. Being a first-timer, our server gave me her suggestions and recommended customer favorites. She really did provide phenomenal service. In case you were wondering, the restrooms are clean which was surprising for a sports bar.",

There weren't any clean empty tables, so we sat at a high top that the waitress cleaned once we were finally noticed. Great view of all the games and such, but I didn't have a good first impression. Servers were friendly, but they seemed poorly organized.  We both ordered peanut butter burgers. I love peanut butter on a burger, but this lacked anything fresh to contrast it with. There was a lot of meat, some crispy bacon, and PB- that's all. It tasted good, but was hard to eat. I like their multiple patty options for turkey and veggie burgers, though. I had onion rings as my side and they were over-battered, almost all dough. Bae's thin fries were much better.",

You go punch it in to the little pos system and then boom cooking guys make said food!! But no no this proved to tought for one...no she had to first REALIZE  she didnt put the food order in..then act like she DIDNT forget to put the order in..then put the food order in and try to put a rush on it, at that point I told her to cancle the order and just bring the check. The absolute smartest thing the waitress did was to bring the check along with the prepubescent manager with his feeble \"I'm sorry\" and \"here's 2 $10 coupons for your next visit\" really so I still get to pay $30 for the 2 drinks that were messed up too (only repeated the order to her 3 times!)...oh gee thanks! Keep your coupons for the poor fools who choose to return to this hole!! I'll spend my money anywhere else but here!!!  *I'll be keeping a close eye on my credit card statement for the next few months!*",

Always get it with a side salad because their blue cheese dressing is to die for.  My bf also really loves their wings... golden hot.. but be careful because the heat is no joke.  We go to the Scottsdale zipps sometimes because we live closer but the Mill location is our favorite because there is more room and more TVs!  This place deserves at least 4 stars!",

I had heard people recommend their foccacias and the pepper jack one I had was very good. The sweet jalapeno sauce they served it with wasn't something I liked, but it went fine with ranch. The drinks are good and they have different drink/food deals each day of the week. I was there for almost 5 hours the last time I went and my bill was very reasonable. Further, I wound up changing tables three times due to weather and TV view and had three different servers the whole time. They were all very attentive towards our table. Will definitely keep coming here for football games.",

We sat at the bar and it took about 10 minutes to be greeted even though the bar was not very busy at all. We asked for some menu's and water and it took about another 5 minutes for the water. I decided to order some green chile and chicken spring rolls with cheese. My friend got some turkey chili. It took about another 15 to 20 minutes for the food to come out and I watched it sit there for another few minutes before the bartender/waitress even saw it which was a little ridiculous with how slow they seemed.  The chicken spring rolls were actually really good and they were served with a sweet jalapeno sauce which complemented them nicely. My friend's turkey chili was really good but very spicy, so be prepared for that if you order this.  Overall the food was pretty good. Service was slow. If I was in the area again and needed some apps and beer this might be a stop I would make. Return factor 50/50",

The zipparita is actually very good for the happy hour at only $3. When it says there's a limit on the menu, I knew I would get my money's worth of alcohol.  When we ordered food, we got the mild buffalo wings and the chips and guac.... Not a bad wait for both of the items with how busy it was. The buffalo wings in mild were way too bland for me so we had to get a side of medium sauce for the extra kick. For the chips and guac, both very good but had to a season the guac with much more salt and pepper. For the rest of the night it was just more drinks.  For it being March Madness, I would love to be back here again during this week. A great place to watch games as TVs are absolutely everywhere. Keep up the nice work as a new sports bar on Mill and people will continue to come in! Be back soon!",

PUT UP SOME REAL SHADE. Additionally, all of the outdoor screens are difficult to view because of their over-the-top housing that hasn't been cleaned and have collected dust on the inside of the covers.

When our food did arrive it was cold. We complained but were only offered Zipps \"bucks\". When we asked for a manager, Hakon never came over until we sought him out, literally walking around the restaurant looking for him. He only offered to cover the food we did not eat. After waiting over an hour I was starving and at the appetizer we ordered. He also indicated that corporate has stick rules and prevents them from comping the food. I am confused how corporate would know this, but ok... It really doesn't come down to the comp, it comes down to waiting over an hour, due to the waitress forgetting to put our order in and then they only offered 15.00 Zipps bucks for 5 people, so we can each have $3.00.....",

He took care of everyone in my party, learned each of our names, and got our order right. He remembered I was allergic to onions and made sure the pico de gallo on the nachos was put in the side. I will only sit in his area of the bar just to get this kind of detailed service. Thank you for proving me wrong the first time Zipps. I will definitely be a returning customer.",

A small Mexican kid that probably got picked on in elementary school cut us off pre mature. I NEVER write reviews but I play for the Angels and hardly ever go out.

The place can get crowded for lunch but its a great place to go to watch a game after work as well. It can take 30 minutes or longer to get your lunch so plan accordingly especially if they are super busy. Happy hours specials are good! by far the best item on the menu is their burgers, love the blk and blue burger. Also the 1,000 island burger is great as well. you can sub fries for either half onion rings & fries or side salad or even sweet potato fries. Its hard to steer away from the burgers but they also have salads, sandwiches, etc. They even have different meat for their burgers such as chicken and i think turkey.  Also they burgers come w 2 patties if you want just 1 ask, and if you want the greens, tomato, etc ask as well not all burgers come with. Their appetizers are excellent and their wings are highly recommended. They have several local beers and your standard bud, miller in both pint and large mugs.",

    "text": "The WORST customer service I can say I have literally experienced. We arrived And our waitress asked if we would like anything to drink. We ordered our drinks and she returned with our drinks in a timely manner. She then proceeded to ask if we would like appetizers. Keep in mind there are 4 of us. I replied that I would like mozzarella sticks. She said \"OK\" and walked away. We attempted to get her attention, but she conitued to walk away. She returns with the mozzarella sticks and we didn't say anything and the rest of my party just ordered their meals. About 10 minutes later a couple walked in and they placed their order. About 10 minutes later they received their meals. With that said they had ordered chicken wings, which is EXACTLY what we ordered along with a salad and chicken sandwhich. 20 mins has past and we have YET to see our waitress. She came out about 2 minutes later at which point we had to get her attention. She comes over and we ask where our food is? She says \"Oh let me go check on that for you!\" 5 minutes has passed and our waitress has not returned  and we decided it's time to go. We walked to the front and paid for our drinks but they didn't add the mozzarella sticks. At this point while she was ringing us my friend asked if he could speak with the manager. She walks back to get him and he has our food. We inform him that at this point because of the horrible service we have received we are going to eat at another establishment. He proceeds to say, you ordered crispy wings which takes longer to prepare. My friend told him, the people behind us came in 10 minutes after we did and received their wings about 10 minutes later so your comment is just an excuse and we left. Lack of communication with your customers is the #1 reason I will ever write a negative review. Had our waitress come and checked up on us at least once and let us know that it should be about another \"designate at time frame\" we would have been patient and waited. The Simplest little things can make the biggest difference..",

He then told us to do the math and write down what we want to go to each card. After seeing we were getting pretty upset our server came over and said this is how it's always been and that it even says it on the menu, but we never got menus or told that they don't spit tabs. Then she also had the nerve to tell us that the manager was making an exception for us. I guess having us split up our own checks for them is making an exception for us. I will never go back to this place especially with such a priss of a manager that doesn't try to make things right or look you in the eye to say that they were wrong.",

But that positive atmosphere quickly changes during the evening hours.   First, the wing selection is decent. Nothing earth shattering, but good quality wings. The sides are a bit skimpy and the wait staff is friendly.   As for the evening experience, you may want to venture to another location. My waitress during the evening had to apologize several times because of the poor bartender service and slow kitchen. This time I brought a friend because of the good lunch service. That service quickly turned sour and habitually slow. After being seated it took nearly 20 minutes to have any waitress to ask what we would like to order. Our mixed drinks appeared approximately 20 minutes later. That was 40 minutes without drinks. Food arrived about 30 minutes after our drinks arrived. This means we waited over an hour to be served wings. There was no excuse because the place wasn't filled with many customers. In fact, many left because of the slow service.   Typically I would give balanced high marks because of a previous experience. But this location has lots of growing to do if it wishes to compete with a thriving campus community. I would highly recommend visiting for lunch but not for dinner.",

The wings were very good though, so not a total loss.",

Basically, the food was jut average bar food. Same as one would expect at a joint. But this is not a joint. This is on Mill, it is large and new and we all expected more. The waitress was nice enough but not very present. The company was good, which made up for the food, but having been to Zipps Camelback and Zipps over by Shea I think I would recommend you go to one of those instead.   That being said, according to our ASU lunch guests, this place is packed end to end with coeds most night of the week so it will probably outlive you and I both, Longer or shorter depending on your age. Just don't expect fine dining or even a reasonable bill. No one got ill, so that's something.    Oh, and parking is a B-.",

Throw in a $4.50 Bloody Mary, and you have a Sunday Funday on your hands.  I had the Burger with Green Chili's and it was delicious.  PepperJack cheese, green chilis, and a side of Chili to go with it?  Yes Please.  Prices were reasonable, and the food was good.  It's worth giving it a try, if there is a happy hour going on!",

They still needed to work out all the kinks.  We came here for lunch and it was almost a 2 hour lunch ordeal.  Our waitress was super nice but everything including our waitress were disorganized.  Once we ordered our food it took 30-40 minutes to get and a couple girls in our party had to wait a little longer, once we got our food it was good.  We ordered sandwiches, wings, salad everyone was pretty pleased with the food except the sweet potato fries  were over cooked, but no big deal.    Check Please!  Lordy....that took another 30 minutes.  Our waitress was running back and forth between 3 registers to process our checks.  That was ridiculous!  I hope this place gets their stuff together because on Mill Ave. those worker bees who work in the area need to get in and out within in hour.  Zipps can accommodate large parties which was great, but plan on a 2 hour lunch.  I'll be back in May or June to try it again for lunch.  We will see if they have improved.",

We just ordered burgers and fries and it took over 35 minutes to get our food which we thought was kind of long for 3 o'clock in the afternoon  The turkey burger was pretty small but I guess it was only 7.50 but it just was a pretty small portion .  Our server Tiffany was cute and great with the diet coke refills but just not to friendly.  Maybe mad working on ST PATTYS DAY   Was kind of random but there was a french fry in our salad I thought it was cool but my friend was pretty upset  I would give 3 to 4 stars if the staff is nicer and they didn't harass me on my dog I can deal with having to wait for food all in all together my experience was 1 to 2 stars at best",

The place is huge and we have never had trouble getting a table or a seat at the bar. The service has always been at least good if not great.   Yes, their food is bar food (that is what they are, a SPORTS BAR). Go somewhere else if you do not want good but not-so-good-for-you bar food.  Our favs on the food menu are the medium gold wings, monaco focaccia, and sweet jalapeno and barbecue bacon burgers. Onion rings and fries can be hit or miss, but they are SO good on their good days (we do half onion rings & half fries as a side with the burgers or focaccia).",

Are the fries greasy and do they taste like the fryers aren't cleaned often, yeah folks, I'm afraid so. Are the portions large, yes, very large. Are the beer and other specials priced reasonably, yes, they are. Was my service good? At the bar yes. Jennifer was \"Johnny on the Spot\" and always smiling.   Reality check. This is a sports bar in the center of ASU. It's predominately a college hangout. It serves its purpose and audience. I had the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger, cooked medium. Their was so much sauce on the burger it had a life preserver attached to it. I like bacon cooked medium but raw is just too stringy for me. The fries. Wow! If I would have rung my fries out, I could have lubed my old ride for free. A lot of grease is an understatement.   Still? I'd go back for the rest of it. It's a good place to hangout and watch some sports and the bartenders take care of their customers.",

As we are sitting I notice more people coming in and are looking lost just like how we were about the open seating. Now it might have been that we were really hungry, but our food took a while. We both ordered wings. When we got there, they did have a few people seated so we didn't understand why it took as long as it did. When we wanted our check the waitress was no where to be seen. My friend had to ask someone else for our checks. They deftly need to work on there service. Over all I didn't like the experience, but my food was good so I will consider coming back.",

They're not top tier service but they try their best to give the best service possible. Keep in mind this is a sports grill so the food is bar-style. Don't come here expecting top-notch service and cuisine but if you're looking for a good time it's one of the best spots. I would highly recommend for anyone looking for a casual and fun place to eat, drink and/or watch a game. Their zipparitas are the best ($4 on happy hour) and they have nearly a dozen flavors!!! :)",

So sad bc our waitress seemed nice but the fact that our wait time was more than my allotted lunch time and we were there at 1115am with only three other tables and didn't leave until after 12:30 makes this the WORST joint for customer service. Not to mention the manager is a JERK, made you pay for extra dressing that they forgot.....no cash, put it on your card! Umm it costs your business more than 50 cents to process a 50 cent card transaction.  His answer? Don't like it don't come back. Really?! You have 4 tables during a rush lunch break and you can afford to basically tell your customer to screw off?  I just hope the waitresses go somewhere else bc I'm sure he hurts them in the tip area. If you're thinking about going to Zipps maybe think about keep traveling on a block or two west on University to Chili's (where Boston's used to be). They're just starting out and still 137 times better in every area this this place. Btw, food was ok, same level as Chili's though and again you'll get better customer service from them than Mr Manager of Mill Ave Zipps could even fathom....137 ZERO stars. I have no idea how they are still in business!!",

Order just a couple and you sure will feel a good buzz! But my favorite is the vodka wells for $2.75 during happy hours, you can't go cheaper than that! They have great happy hour specials and they always have late night specials starting at 8pm with other great deals. Each late night special varies and you can never go wrong with $4 Zipperita's or $4 Fireball shots. Service is fast and friendly. When the big games are on, it does get pack and expect service to be a bit busier than usual. This is always my first stop with happy hour after a long day at work. I haven't been here on the weekends yet but I try to avoid the college binge drinking nights on Mill. I prefer happy hours during daylight (I'm old man) and they are very relaxed here.",

That being said my experience there has forced my hand. I go in sit down I order a 32oz bud light. I start to drink my beer and after one sip I look down and notice that there is a dead cricket, yes literally a dead cricket in my beer. I immediately call the waitress over and notify her of the dead bug and ask for a new beer. She says no problem (but does not apologize). It takes another TEN minutes to get my new beer.. To paint the picture of neglect, I'm also sitting about a table away from the draft beer taps while I watch the same waitress fill up beers and bring them to OTHER tables.  After waiting 10 minutes a manager walks up (heavy set African American man) with a beer in hand and says, \"who ordered the bud light, no cricket\". No apology, just cracks a joke that I almost drank a cricket. I keep my composure and accept the beer thinking that at the least they are going to do is take it off my tab. Fast forward to the check, and I mean really fast forward because it took us easily 30-40 to get our food. I am billed for the beer with the cricket in it and still have received no apology or accommodation for my horrible de-appetizing experience. Needless to say I will never, ever go back.  I feel bad for the waitress it was not her fault but I could not consciously tip her and the blame is on the atrocious management.",

She started to laugh and said literally word for word, \"Haha you're the second person to say that today. I hope the cooks do something about it.\" ARE YOU EVEN IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY???? If a customer says they got SICK from your food, you should probably say something to the cooks?

I am returning to AZ for 5 days after moving away a few years ago. I walked through the front door. Two waitresses chatted away without acknowledging me. I walked 15 feet into the bar area. I had a dumbfounded look on my face as there was no seating. I looked at the NFL football above me. A man in with the Zipps logo on his Golf shirt walked by me without a peep. I walked the other side of the bar. Miss  Leany-Poo was working. She continued her lean. She looked very comfortable. I wanted to be as comfortable as her eating some Zipps wings watching NFL football. After receiving no assistance,I sat myself at a larger table. I sat for 5 minutes with a parched throat. Tell the waitress wearing number 11 that I tip better than the students that sat there after me. The polo shirt guy came by and he wound up being the clown manager. He came over and said I couldn't sit there. I hate being asked to move. I am glad hospitality is alive and well on Mill. I am glad hospitality is alive and well in Arizona. Good bye Zipps on Mill.",

Came in on a Thursday night with 6 people. We were seated and then left for literally 25 min. I had to walk up to a bartender to get them to send someone over to take our order. Our orders were taken and our food took a substantial amount of time. Obviously there were a lot of us, so this was expected. Our food came out cold. I got a 1000 Island burger with fries and onion rings. The bottom half of my bun was so soggy it fell apart the second I picked it up. I asked for another bun and they replaced it. Everyone's fries were cold, not lukewarm, completely cold. No one came over to check how we were doing or to re-fill drinks. They were not understaffed either. A lot of servers were just standing around talking about our table specifically. We could tell because they were pointing and glaring. Finally when our server came over to ask if we were ready for our checks, my friend said she didn't want to pay for her fries because they were cold. The server went and ranted to her manager right in front of us, pointing and making annoyed facial expressions towards our table. They took off $1.50 for her fries. I was charged for a soda I did not order and she said she would take it off when she took my card. I was still charged for the soda when she returned with my receipt. The server had to go back and fix the total she charged me. She was not apologetic and not once did a manager come over to speak to our table. Never going back. Do not waste your time or money. I could've gone to In-N-Out and gotten a better and cheaper burger and would've saved myself an hour and a half of torture. This was the most unprofessional establishment I have ever been to. I wouldn't be surprised if it closed down in a few months.",

We paid for what we had consumed but refused to pay for someone else's tab due to the lack of the waitress keeping track of her clients. Manager was called and there was no help from him either, was threatened to call the police if we did not pay. Police showed up harassing us as well to pay up. I argued to them all as to why I should be stuck paying for someone's tab and have to pay for what we did not consume! To avoid further drama and humiliation we ended up paying the measly $20 tab.

    "text": "My work team decided this was going to be our lunch spot for our monthly outing and to also celebrate my birthday. Unfortunately, we ended up walking out without any service. It was 7 of us and we received the worst welcoming ever! Apparently, they are not hard up for business because they can deny 7 people for business. They wanted to sit all 7 of us on a small table. We had moved a table to accomodate us and a waiter came around to tell us that 6 people normally fit and at a single table and to just pull a chair over. Keep in mind that we are not super models. There are guys who work out and ladies who eat healthy. He was not budging on the fact that we were comfortable with the extra small table we pulled and continued to ask that we squeeze all in. The place was damn near empty but he said, \"We could get busy and might need that table\". So we said buh bye!",
