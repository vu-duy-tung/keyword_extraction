Im a big Reuben. fan, and this was excellent. Hubby had a ham and cheese omelette which he devoured within minutes. I usually don't like ordering coffee at restaurants because you never know what you're getting, however the coffee here was delicious, robust and freshly brewed, came in a large white cup and served extra piping hot as it should be. Our server, Keegan, was so attentive, professional and friendly, as were the host, bussers and the manager, John, who came by to check up on us. I will definitely be back for either breakfast or lunch. How could you not love a restaurant with good food and excellent service!",

Not at all.   My scrambled eggs were not scrambled. They were more like fluffed, folded, and served on a plate. The waffle had a bit of a tree bark taste, less than sweet, and my toast was cold so the butter I spread didn't even melt.   However, our service was stellar, she was on it, (minus the smell of her smoke break that lingered as she passed by) I also really appreciated her splitting the checks each way for our large party of six.   Sure, it's good breakfast. But is it \"omg amazing\" and worth the long Saturday morning wait? No.",

I've always been sat quickly, drinks are always quick to arrive at the the table, which out here when it's hot is one of the best things to happen in a restaurant.  The Chorizo Mac & Cheese is fantastic! I've also had the fish and chips, I love the red cabbage side that comes with it.  I alternate between sweet potato fries and crispy fries.  The ranch is fantastic, it's a chipotle ranch.  I keep saying I'm going to try a hamburger but I just have not got around to it yet, because there are so many good things.  One of the best things is they have happy hour everyday from 4-9pm and it's quite a large happy hour menu!",

After a quick glance of the menu two items popped out at me for different reasons. The Nachos (w/o chicken)  this was the few drinks in half of my brain talking and the Risotto cakes from my foodie soul.  While we waited for our food I enjoyed the 3d look of the rocks in acrylic tables and contemporary decorations.  Our food arrived, and it looked good, but the cheese on the nachos had already cooled and had time to solidify and the pico de gallo was quickly making the chips soggy. The flavors ere good but it would have been much better if it got to us sooner.  The risotto cakes also had a great taste, but they were luke warm too, they were served on a nice bed of greens with a balsamic dressing.  With just a bit more care this place could be good, they have many specials and a decent menu, but the kitchen and or service hurts the overall experience.",

The wait was 30 minutes or so on a Saturday which is pretty typical from what we hear. They had chairs outside the restaurant, and also provided free coffee while we waited. Once inside we were waited in by Tonia who is super sweet, and attentive to our needs. The food was delicious, and there were a number of healthy options to pick from which is sometimes a challenge. All in all we were so happy to of had such a great experience.  Much love from chicago!",

I came with a friend and we waited 45+mins for Sunday Brunch. Let me tell you that it was delish! They've got 6 kinds of eggs Benedict including:   - Roasted Red Pepper  - Turkey Sausage -  Black Forest Ham - Smoked Salmon - Crab Cake  -  Prime Rib  - Chorizo (YUM!)  I ordered the Chorizo Eggs Benedict and was very pleased with my order. A friend of mine ordered the Chorizo Omelet and liked her dish. Guacamole on the side is delish. Also tried the DD hash (will def get this on my next visit!)   One thing I appreciate about the place is free coffee outside even though there's a Starbucks next door. One thing I love about this place is that they place cucumber in their served iced water. I absolutely love it when breakfast places do this. It gives the water a nice refreshing taste!",

Our server thought there were 4 people coming so no service after the drinks arrived, I guess there were 4 menus on the table. All she needed was for ask, however lets give her a pass. Now for the real reason for the 1 star, the food, my pancakes were like cardboard, the fruit was stale and tasteless my ice tea was flavorless. The waffles were terrible and the omelets were tasteless! And through all this, the fire alarm went off 4 times.  Let me say something positive, the prices were reasonable.",

My husband had an omelette and I had a chicken sandwich. Both were excellent and the sweet potato fries were the best I have ever had. They are kid friendly and have a wonderful kids menu. My daughter loved her egg and pancake and she is a picky eater. Excellent choice if you are looking for a big breakfast/brunch in Scottsdale. We didn't try the drinks but the drink menu and bar were servicing some beautifully presented drinks with lots of garnish. I hope to come back to try these soon. Really glad we found his place!",

We ordered the Gladiator burger & daily dose burger which were both just okay. They were both lacking flavor and the msuhroom brie was mediocre. Despite the fact it was dead, we felt very rushed. Hope was training another waitress - I hope the trainee doesn't listen to her. Besides rushing her patrons, she talked down to her own trainee. When she introduced her trainee, she literally said, \"Don't ask her questions because she's new and won't know.\" WOW. I've been a waitress before and I would have been furious if I was talked to like that during my training, and as a patron - it looks horrible that you are degrading your own coworker.",

I had a chorizo omelet which was delightfully fluffy and stuffed not-quite-to-the-gills but just enough with picante chorizo, melty cheddar and red onion.  This omelet was amazing!  But it was not to be outdone by its accoutrements.  They serve it up with sauteed herbed potatoes that are perfectly seasoned and browned, and were some of the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had.  The toast is thick cut and deliciously buttered.  And the side of guacamole was full of rich avocado chunks and a hint of citrus.  But what really blew me away was the house creation of rosemary creme fraiche, an accompaniment that was the perfect complement to everything else on the plate.  Rosemary creme fraiche on your omelet?  Definitely.  Rosemary creme fraiche as a dipper for herbed potatoes?  Damn straight.    I am literally devastated that this place is almost 2000 miles from where I live.  Otherwise they would have a new best customer.",

The first time I went, I shared the breakfast nachos with a friend and jeez are they dangerously delectable. The nachos along with the bacon Bloody Mary should be a prescription for a hangover.     The next two times I got the Strawberry Mint Salad with Grilled chicken. The balance of Salad , goat cheese and strawberries are perfect. Not overly dressed , but each bite is flavorful and refreshing. I think I found my latest addiction. I will be back soon to get my daily dose.",

It was something I could have put together myself. The waiter came back 2 different times to ask me what kind of bread I wanted and to see if she heard me correct on what I ordered. You would think she would write it down or ask me what kind of bread I preferred when I ordered it. For the food, you literally get one little package of Philadelphia cream cheese and are supposed to just plop that onto your bagel. I couldn't believe that it wasn't in an already opened container or that they made their own. It was such an inconvenience at a restaurant. The bagel and lox was definitely not restaurant quality.

Service, on the other hand, is slow and the staff are less than friendly. We have eaten here many times, and we definitely return for the food. This afternoon my husband and I stopped by for a mid-afternoon drink and a bite to eat. We really enjoy sitting on the patio, and we were happy to see there were no customers waiting and there were a couple of open tables on the patio.  We asked for a table on the patio and were told they were getting ready to seat someone there. We looked around and saw no one waiting. I peeked at the \"wait list\" and all the names were already crossed off. We were a little baffled, but instead of making a big deal about it we just left.  We have eaten at Daily Dose for years, and it is just recently we have run into problems when requesting a patio table. The last three times we've asked, we were told tables weren't available even though they most clearly were. Last time we were here we were seated at a table just inside, looking out onto the patio, after being told a patio table wasn't available. It was a full 20 minutes, if not longer, before anyone was seated at the open table. Bottom line, if you really want to enjoy Daily Dose's menu, make sure you have plenty of time, and don't expect patio seating unless you have some sort of golden ticket that seems to be required for admittance.",

Started off with a mimosa which I liked the proseco they used (not too sweet and not too dry) we also got a sangria (which was pre made- nothing fancy here tasted like hi-c punch.

The bacon Bloody Mary was good as well but make sure to eat the bacon strip fast before it becomes water logged and limp.  To round out our healthy meal we had the chorizo mac and cheese, which was as good as it sounds.   The best part of the Daily Dose is the coffee canisters outside for those waiting for a table.

We were happy they opened early on Saturday since a lot of brunch restaurants in the area don't open til 11am. The restaurant was very busy but we managed to snag a table with no wait. The service was quick and attentive, when we were worried there was a mix-up in our coffees our waitress offered to make us new ones. They have lots of fun iced coffee drinks with syrups which we tried. I had the southwest flannel hash with two poached eggs which was delicious and a perfect portion. It was so hard to pick anything because the menu was so big and everything sounded great.",

Fresh hand made vegetable burger with cucumber yogurt dressing on a pretzel bun.  And don't even get me started on the delicious sweet potato fries!!  Sadly, they have changed the recipe of the veggie burger and I wish they didn't.  I ordered this burger a week ago at the Scottsdale location I instantly noticed the change.  It was lacking the flavor and the moistness but it was still good enough to eat. However, today I ordered a veggie burger from the midtown location in Phoenix and the burger was hard, dry and so thin and lifeless.  Whole wheat bun was dry as well.  Fries were delicious as always which is why I am still giving two stars.  Very sad to say that I will be taking daily dose off my list of favorite restaurants",

So glad we found it! Our cocktails were delicious - and there were plenty of specialty cocktails! I had a bagel sandwich that had bacon, eggs, tomato, etc. I don't remember what DD called it, but it was delicious. The bagel was soft, making it easy to keep it as a sandwich instead of a bagel with breakfast falling out of it. So good! My friend got rancheros. She was quite pleased with the twist they had on it - and I can tell you it looked delicious! Not only was everything tasty, but the food came out so faster than it took me to decide what I wanted to eat!  I'd definitely like to go back some time, as all of the food that I saw coming out looked and smelled quite tasty!",

She  was soooooo friendly... I really liked her and she didn't have to try hard to please us. She took out orders and made sure our drinks were full...  The manager was also very nice and also made us feel very welcomed  As for my meal I chose the flannel corned beef hash meal and it was surprisingly good It was a twist on the traditional corned beef hash and I liked it My over medium eggs were yummy I usually don't eat toast when I order but I guess I was hungry and chowed it down  All in all, daily dose is a great breakfast place and I hope that everyone has a great experience here  Get a mimosa",

LOL  With gelato calling my name, us still needing dinner, and wanting a burger than Thai food Saturday night...I suggested D.D.    We arrive and its pretty empty inside with one party of 8 seated a few tables over.  We sit down and wait about 5+ minutes for someone to come take a drink order (though someone had been around with water a minute after we sat down). A few minutes longer and J said he would have wanted to leave.    The water you get is cucumber water, with a slice of cucumber in it.  I didn't mind, but J thought it was terrible.   The gal comes by and we order our beverages and decide on an app because they were on happy hour special.    The Chicken Pouches are very tasty!!! J especially liked the sesame orange and balsamic reduction sauce.  He's not a huge fan of wontons, but he liked these.    We both ordered burgers with the combo fries (sweet potato and crispy) -  Mine - DD Burger w. bacon on the side  J - Gladiator.   These burgers were huge!!!  The bacon was especially tasty and I ate it separate from my burger.  J ate about 3/4 of the burger and said he was stuffed.  But said that the burger was good.  Portion sizes were generous.  And he would suggest it to his coworkers for one of their Friday lunch outings.    Will I be back?  Silly question!   Breakfast or Lunch/Dinner..this place is a winner!",

    "text": "I really like this place.   I had heard a lot about Daily Dose's HH, and finally met a couple friends here recently to test it out. Funny thing is, the restaurant itself wasn't really what I was expecting but that was actually a good thing. What I mean by that is Daily Dose is actually, well, a restaurant. I was kind of expecting more of a typical Old Town bar/restaurant (which isn't necessarily a bad thing), but nope. It's really just a casual dining spot. When I was here there were people of all different ages (not just 20/30 somethings you'd expect to see at HH in Old Town) & I think I even spotted a few families with kids, and that didn't seem weird at all because like I said, this is more casual dining, not just a bar that serves food.   As far as HH goes, the food menu is great! Daily Dose has SEVERAL fairly cheap options with lots of variety and good sized portions. As far as drinks go (and I should note, at this current time I'm unable to drink alcohol for medical reasons so this wasn't a big concern of mine) I actually didn't think the drink specials were all THAT great for HH. I mean, they were obviously cheaper compared to regular prices and still good deals, but there are several bars in Old Town where the HH drink specials are little cheaper. That being said they have several beers on tap, and a few of which are hard to come by so that's always good!  As far as the food goes, we honestly didn't try all that much. We had chips, salsa, and guac. I liked Daily Dose's salsa. It's chunky & has a bit of (what I think was) tomatilla flavor. I also liked there guac. I'm normally not a big fan of real chunky guac, which is what Daily Dose has, but for whatever reason I like theirs. We also got pretzels w/cheese. The pretzels were soft & chewy, which is what I prefer & I liked the cheese sauce (it had a little kick to it). The one thing I wasn't all that crazy about was the chorizo mac & cheese. I thought the cheese was kind of runny & there wasn't a whole lot of chorizo. It wasn't bad though. I'd like to come back to Daily Dose to try (a lot) of other things on the menu.   Overall, I like this place. It's very casual for Old Town & they have a rally nice patio (w/a nice TV). I'll be back!",

I have no idea what they put in their hollandaise since it's so addicting. To top it all off, they give you a huge cup of coffee rather than the miniature ones at every other restaurant. I don't know about you, but a giant cup of coffee is needed every morning during breakfast! If you aren't a fan of Eggs Benedict then try their Breakfast Nachos. It's heavenly.",

    "text": "Our visit took place on a Monday afternoon. At first we were concerned bc our waitress came off a bit aloof and disinterested. I requested a sample of the tempeh bc my prior experiences with it were not good.  At that point, the manager showed up with the sample and she was super nice.  Afterwards, our waitress warmed up when she saw I was interested in ordering the cinnamon roll pancake lol. She actually wound up being extremely helpful. She made sure we didn't order too much food and saved us some money!  She confirmed my interest in the cinnamon roll pancake which was probably one of the best things I have EVER eaten! On the healthier end,  I was feeling rundown so the protein bowl was a great fit for this vegetarian: egg whites, tempeh, avocado,  basmati rice, queso fresco & kale. The orange juice was freshly squeezed with the perfect amount of sweetness. Overall a good experience. You lost a star and a half for cleaning (sweeping, shaking out things and spraying the window) while we were eating. Yuck, I really dislike that!",

I am a huge fan of their benedicts especially their crab cake bene.  My friends are healthy eaters and always raved about their Egg White wrap or the Turkey and Sausage White out.  Servers were always helpful and courteous, even when my hung over friend had random requests like 2 medium poached eggs and wheat toast no butter.  Mimosas are great here too so make sure you aren't hung over to get one.    The owners often stop by tables to see how things are going and are very friendly.  One time one of our friends was a little green from the night before and the owner brought her over an herb remedy to help settle her stomach.  The place can get busy but service is always great as is the food.  I haven't made it there for dinner yet but it is def on the agenda.  Great work DD!!",

DD style (trade sausage gravy for hollandaise) - very filling as you can imagine.   breakfast club will still be the old town brunch location for when visitors come visit me but for week in and week out sunday morning brunch, this is my spot.",

DD's rating is a huge beneficiary of my love for fantastic beer on tap, and offers up 5 great microbrews....including an IPA *drooling*.  The food is good to very good, and the only complaint I have is pretzel dough on a hamburger is just way too heavy!  The burger itself is fantastic.  On my first trip, they were woefully understaffed which = bad service and angry Little Lady, but my last visit was much better and our server was cheerful, attentive, and split the check 300 ways as we had a large party.  Any server that can smile while trying to handle that math deserves a hefty tip.  The patio sits right on Scottsdale Rd (as do most establishments adjacent to the road) but it's not too noisy.  HH goes until 8, and with an eclectic mix of cocktails, beer, and wine, there is something for everyone.  Looking forward to breakfast at the Dose!",

I ordered the Daily Dose Burger -- Bacon and grilled onions --- ohhh.  Well, I enjoyed my burger, but it didn't really kick or pow me palate in anyway.  Needless to say it was decent.  Service, my delight was probably from the hostess, cute gal with a broken arm awww.  Had a fun conversation about the restaurant and made fun of some of the patrons.  I had this weird desire to sign her cast, but didn't want to ask haha!  As for the ambience, it was what I expected - petite with a cute relax atmosphere.

That is what sets the Daily Dose apart from other Old Town food spots. Both the restaurant manager and head chef are there all day everyday making sure every meal is great.   Now the Daily Dose as a number of things going for it: 1. They are one of the only breakfast spots in Old Town. The breakfast is always good and creative...I mean they have breakfast nachos!  2. They have great food other than breakfast. Typically when you have a restaurant that does breakfast their other food suffers. Not at the Daily Dose! Their Turkey Burger on the pretzel bun is incredible. Also if you have always wanted to try a veggie burger but just don't think you will like it don't hesitate at  DD. Their Veggie Burger is great!  3. Maybe the biggest selling point Happy Hour 7 days a week!   One quick tip if you are heading there on a weekend for breakfast make sure you are ready to wait at least 30 minutes. The Daily Dose is and will continue to be a go to spot for breakfast, lunch and dinner for me!",

In addition to their happy hour menu, they offer $2 off burgers and some other menu items from 4-8, so it ends up being a great dinner place as well. They have a couple of great menu items (including their burger and steak salad), and they have a chipotle ranch that is to die for.   It's really busy for lunch and it can take quite a while, so I typically don't go for lunch unless I have a lot of time on my hands. Also, while everyone seems to rave about their breakfast, I don't think it's great. I've been there a couple times for breakfast and I've left disappointed both times. Maybe I ordered the wrong things, but it wasn't for me.  Definitely go for happy hour if you're in the area, and sit outside if it's not too hot.

Eggs Benedict Eggs benedict i think is so simple but i like how one place can come up with different ideas and taste of their hollandaise and this place seriously hit the spot. There was alot of people waiting.. at first i thought it will take us probably 1-1.5 hr of wait.. but nope 15minutes wait!!! SWEEEETTT!!! And theres free coffee while u wait( annddd taste soo good toooo) when we got seated, our host was pretty attentive! Friendly and gave us recommendations too. We got our orders fast too which is nice.. to think they're so busy that time.i love all our orders but the FRENCH TOAST.. MUST TRY!!! Never had that kind of french toast and its amazingly super dooper over good!! Wish we have this in the bay area.. something i will definitely try and visit again when i go back to AZ. Overall HAPPY with my experience here..",

I ate the applewood smoked omelette, it is rare for me to finish every last bite of my food but this place definitely became a member of the clean plate club.

She made great recommendations and steered us away from the things she didn't like (I appreciate the honesty) Over all an excellent experience!",

    "text": "I recently ate at this establishment during my sister's Bachelorette party weekend. I've only heard GREAT reviews of this place about how good their portion sizes are and the food is just wonderful until the last bite. We placed our orders, but the bride to be had some allergies that need special attention. I found it extremely bizarre that an egg was a $2 uncharge when I can got to the grocery store and buy a dozen eggs for $2. Also there should have been a gluten free option for bread if your menu clearly states \"gluten friendly\"..No?... She only wanted a hamburger and the waitress was giving her a run around about allergies. I guess this place wasn't very accommodating.   My plate came out along with the others and it all looked pretty decent. However, the brides plate came out and it looked like a frozen patty (McDonalds style) with 2 measly slices of beacon over the top. No cheese, no lettuce, no tomato, there wasn't even a side. It looked like the most pathetic burger EVER! She asked the waitress about what had come out and the waitress decided to get the manager. The manager came out and immediately had a wall up and was not willing to listen to her. He reduced her into tears basically telling her there was nothing he could do about the plate that came out of the kitchen. He didn't apologize or even offer to take the plate back and offer something else off the menu. Let me tell you - as a bystander I have never felt more uncomfortable. We're sitting at a table during my sister's bachelorette party weekend and she's crying because the manager is telling her he is RIGHT and she is WRONG as a paying customer who is unable to eat gluten.   I work in the service industry and I've never seen anything like this. What a terrible representation of the business. Not sure who hired him. The customer is always right, even if they aren't. You want to maintain a good running business and not drive paying customers away. At the end of our meal we were charged incorrectly for our drinks and the manager managed to stay far from our table. (Maybe embarrassed or just didn't give a hoot). If you're in the mood for good food and GOOD service I would not plan on going here. There's tons of different options within walking... Don't hesitate! Go somewhere else.",

The menu description of the cinnamon roll cakes doesn't do it enough justice!!!! OMG!! These have to be the absolute BEST pancakes I've ever eaten! GET THEM!!! You will not be disappointed! The pancake mix tastes perfect and they must cook it on some kind of cast iron skillet because the finish has a crunchy bite! Lord have mercy! A pancake this good should be against some kind of law!! If they opened a location in Atlanta I would definitely become morbidly obese! Dont leave without having the Cinnamon Roll Cakes!!",

I'll go back to Daily Dose. It's surprisingly tasty for being so trendy. I actually think the cream ruined it. The food is great too. I got a crabby omelette with a side of fruit and it was really good. I thought I was making a mistake by going on a late Sunday morning for brunch, but they actually got us a table pretty quickly (like within three minutes) and our server was a really nice guy. I was really happy with my experience and I can't wait to go back. If it were in my budget, I'd make it a weekend tradition!",

    "text": "We had a wonderful breakfast here this morning.  Luckily we were able to park very nearby and we were seated immediately as it was not at all busy.  My veggie omelet was delicious, filled with a variety of vegetables including asparagus.  My husband enjoyed his chorizo omelet which could be topped with avocado, which looked a lot like guacamole.  We both liked the rosemary creme fraiche that accompanied the potatoes.  I only got one slice of multigrain toast, but I liked that it had plenty of seeds.  I'm glad I asked for jelly because the server brought a generous helping of raspberry spread that was thick and most likely homemade (?).  My husband and I each chose fruit for our second side and we enjoyed the fresh pineapple, watermelon, and honeydew melon.  All in all, it was delicious and I am glad we chose this restaurant at the end of our staycation in Paradise Valley.",

I've had their egg's benedict, mixed berry protein pancakes, and southwest wrap...I LOATHE hollandaise  sauce but I could not stop eating it and were cooked to perfection...I don't think Paula Dean could beat that.  The protein pancakes were amazing as well.  They have breakfast drinks too which are also quite scrumptious  Breakfast Cons:  On weekends, the wait is unreal...and when you wake up after fun night out in Old Town, you either go somewhere else where they will seat you sooner or cure your hangover with a few of their delicious bloody marys.  Dinner Pros:  Happy hour EVERYDAY during the summer from 4-8pm and it is really good.  Try any of their burgers (-$3 during happy hour) and you will be happy.  Chicken tacos are pretty amazing too and again super cheap during HH.  Dinner Cons:  Can sometimes get slow and isn't as much fun as weekend brunch but if you're with friends, it doesn't really matter cos the food and drinks are great.  Food gets: 4.5/5 Overall due to wait times:  4/5",

    "text": "Well, I feel dumb.  So finally, after 28 years of living (or visiting) in Arizona, I venture to Daily Dose to meet a friend for breakfast on a Friday. Why did it take so long you ask? Well, I'm not for waiting in line for an hour for breakfast on the weekends.  I'm not really a fan (I'd rather eat lunch or dinner options) of breakfast and can't justify waiting that long. Anyhow, my fiend's schedule and mine happened to align where we could meet for breakfast and I suggested this spot cause I knew it would probably be the only time I would be able to walk right in. I picked a spot on one of the four high top tables outside and ordered a cafe caramel ($4.25) while I waited for my friend. The waitress brought me a water while I waited for my drink to be made and it came with a cucumber in it! I love cucumber water! A few minutes later and my coffee came out and it was super delicious! My friend showed up, looked at my drink and decided in a cappuccino, that she says was really tasty as well.   For our entree, we decided to split the Smokey stuffed portabella mushroom that is stuffed with egg whites, roasted red pepper, and smoked gouda. Yes, I said smoked gouda!! It's served with fresh fruit and toast. We asked our super friendly waitress what we could get besides the toast and she started to tell us we could get cottage cheese, potatoes, or a sweet potato hash that has grilled onions. We opted for the sweet potatoe hash, like I'm sure you, dear reader, would have chosen. We also decided to split the Strawberry ginger snap granola and ordered an extra two egg whites .   Oh my freaking gawd! Everything was so incredibly delicious, my friend and I couldn't stop talking about what idiots we were for not trying this place out sooner. The total for everything, and it was a lot of food that we couldn't even finish, was $31.00! What the bleep? All that delicious food and drinks for $31! This is the best place ever and I would so wait for 30-45 minutes (but not an hour) to eat here again. Everything on the menu looked delicious and it will be hard not to order what I had because it was so good, but I'm excitied to try out the other options,  So thank you Daily Dose for making me feel like dumbass. Can't wait until we meet again!",

But the real thing that won me over about DD was the breakfast!  Best breakfast I have had in AZ for sure!  There were so many things I wanted to try and I can't wait to go back again!  I tried the turkey sausage, egg white omelet with toast and fruit; protein pancake; and sausage gravy & biscuits.  All of it was amazing.  I was thinking the protein pancakes would be like US Egg's but they are not.  They are very different but in a good way.   I really want to try the lunch as well.

    "text": "Came into town for the Phoenix Rock N Roll Half Marathon, and was lookin' for some pretty good eats for my  post-run.  I checked out Yelp for some Mexican food down the street, though the place ended up being closed on Sundays. Decided to walk the town, and saw some Mexican food along the way, but got turned off by the ones that seemed like a \"loud bar first; food second\".   Got close to the end of Old Town; the choices were slim; yet nothing screamed at me. The only two left were the sandwich shop (next door), and the Daily Dose Grill. The crowds and outdoor seating here caught my eye, and even though I was starving, decided to muster up the energy to wait.  The restaurant was crowded with a buzz, yet not too loud, subtly lit in a good way, and had good energy. Being solo though, I was quickly seated at the bar, where I could sit, and take in the football game on TV.  The bartender was perky, and took my order. I ordered the -   Green Chili Chicken Enchiladas - Hand shredded chicken stewed in green chili sauce, rolled in a southwest tortilla & topped with cheddar cheese. at 9.95   Note - I ordered extra cheese - with additional avocado.  The food wait, though, was about 40 minutes; the gentleman sitting next to me had been waiting even way longer, and by the time his chicken nachos came, I almost grabbed a few!  Mine finally arrived. For what it was, the meal was actually pretty good. The chicken tasted tender, hot,  and fresh, and they gave me a decent amount of avocado.  It wasn't quite what I expected, though. When they say \"enchilada\", I'm expecting something a little bit more cheesy, saucy, and perhaps baked a little bit. This tasted more like a chicken wrap. Though the chicken was shredded, moist, and slow-cooked, it tasted more lke a chicken wrapped in tortilla, with a little green chile sauce added.  Like I said, though, for what it was, it was pretty good. The gentleman next to me actually complained about the wait time, and got a discount off of his check! I should've gone that route...  The food, ambience, and the uinqueness of this place warrants coming here again, though because of the service, and my expectation, they get only three (rather than four) stars.",

Chill atmosphere and none of the \"scene\" found at many other Scottsdale restaurants.  I go here often and the service is normally attentive and quick though breakfast may be a little slow if you are in a hurry.  The green chile enchiladas are one of my favorites, would rate them a 5 except the rice they plate up with them is horrible, only bad thing I can say I have had here.  Good chorizo as well as lots of healthier options for breakfast.",

    "text": "So let me start off by saying that I love Daily Dose. I'm just not a fan of the Scottsdale location. I was actually at the Mid-Town location Sunday morning and my breakfast was perfect and the service was flawless as usual. My daughter wanted Daily today for her birthday breakfast so we decided to go to the Scottsdale location rather than Mid Town because we wanted to stay east today. Messed our order up, then we waited forever to see a server to get it right then brought over missing item cold after the entire meal was finished mind you. I'm like ok, whatever, prob comp birthday girls hot chocolate for messing up her order. No. I just thought it would be thoughtful to try to make up for messing up my daughters order. The food was fine the service meh, but coming from Mid Town I guess I have to lower my standards when I eat at the Scottsdale location. I will go back to Daily just never Scottsdale. It's never been a great experience there for me :/",

Our favorite, Chorizo Mac and Cheese, was great and the pretzels were good, although we had to send them back because they did not come as requested, with butter and salt. My son's turkey burger was tasteless and dry. I ordered one chorizo taco, usually a fave, which came cold. Not just room temperature cold, but cold like just out of the fridge cold. The waitress was incredibly rude. We made several requests for plates so that we could share the food which had already been served without success. Finally, I asked the waitress for plates and she replied, \"The bus boy does that\" and walked away. I complained to the manager who did respond very well, pleasant and offering to comp the mac and cheese, but the waitress spent the rest of the evening giving us dirty looks and avoiding our table. What happened to professionalism? It was my son's last meal in the US before leaving for overseas and he had been so looking forward to it. What a disappointment.",

    "text": "Good food and good prices don't make up for slow service.  We decided to go to Daily Dose only because we saw they had outdoor dog-friendly seating. The hostess said the wait time would be about 20 minutes. After about 10 mins of waiting, we saw a bunch of tables open up, yet nobody was being seated. After another 20 minutes of waiting,I asked the hostess how much longer it would be before we would be seated, she said another 10 minutes at least. The table we were eventually seated at had been empty for a good 15 minutes. Meanwhile, half of the other patio tables are empty as well... Slowly the hostess seated some of the other waiting customers.  Our waitress was very nice and pleasant. She recommended a delicious berry sangria which was amazing... We were later surprised to find that the sangria cost only $4... We decided to stay for another glass once we saw the check.  The food tasted good. Hefty portions and delicious turkey sausage. Now, I'm not much of a sausage eater but this was some darn good sausage.  I went to the bathroom and eavesdropped on some other customers who were complaining about the really slow service. I didn't pay much attention to it because they seemed like the whiney complaining type.    I would recommend this place if you have endless amounts of patience for the slow service. At the end of the day, the food was good. Bonus points for allowing dogs outside.  However, we contemplated leaving before we were seated because of the idiot hostess. She made my blood boil.",

They have so many options, but we went with the eggs benedict with turkey sausage and the berry protein pancakes. Both were absolutely delicious - the hollandaise on the benedict was tasty and light, while the turkey sausage was super flavorful with a tiny bit of spice. The berry protein pancakes seem like they'd be too healthy to also be delicious, considering they're made with honey wheat batter and protein flax seed granola, but they're amazingly good...I wish all things so healthy could taste so good. Service was terrific - prompt and friendly. With The Breakfast Club just up the street, Old Town is lucky to have two great breakfast spots!",

However I  am slowly beginning to learn that if you want a good breakfast at a place that serves alcohol on a Sunday morning in Old Town you have to be prepared to wait a good amoutn of time. With that being said the food was quite good. I got the caprese omlette which was fairly tastey even though that amount of cheese became a little much at the end. Their meals are a good size though and I was sufficiently full (barely able to finsih my bloody mary at the end of the meal.) The atmosphere inside  is pretty cool and the outdoor patio is delightful if you are fortunate enough to get one of their few tables. The last thing is that while you are  waiting, which seems like a life time after a Saturday night out, they offer complimentary coffee and water out front of the door which was nice. I would reccomend this place for sure!",

Stopped in for lunch with my husband since we were already parked nearby.  While the restaurant is fairly small, we were there at an off hour so no wait at all!  We shared the cobb salad and the ancho chili reuben.  They initially brought one salad and the sandwich was split for us.  I foolishly assumed the salad was to be shared until a second one came out.  Are you kidding me?  How big are these salads?  Pretty darn big, and pretty darn good.  Plenty of bacon and blue cheese, and no skimping on the avocado either.  Unfortunately, they don't come in half sizes which is too bad if you're not sharing because I can't imagine being able to finish one (and I can eat) and leftover salad just doesn't work.  Not to mention it's not easy for me to order a salad to begin with.  I have good intentions, but as I open my mouth to speak, something like \"chimichanga\" comes out instead.  The reuben was good, but a little dry.  Next time I'll ask for extra dressing on the side.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying that french toast Julia T raves about!",

The empty plates and beer bottles never lingered long, and the cucumber slice infused (i'll never enjoy lemon-water quite as much again, this stuff was so refreshing!) water glasses were never empty.  Perhaps the wonderful company of multiple yelpers and the genuine conversation had me in a bit of an in-clover stupor, but I left Daily Dose with a feeling of fulfillment that went far beyond my belly.

Not feeling the best, my fiancee and my best friend and I went to the bar to order bloody Mary's while we waited. Apon giving the bar tender (long blonde hair, in 30's) my ID, she studied it skeptically and not thinking it was me(I have brown hair in my pic and I'm now blonde) and after a few awkward moments she asked if I had another ID. I told her no, that when I travel, I only bring one ID so I don't loose any of others I have. I'm 29 years old.. My best friend is 32, and my fiancee is over 40! We don't look young! She didn't ask me to verify any personal info on the ID as they're required to do, but instead stated the obvious that there's no expiration date. News flash: there's no expiration date on AZ state ID's bc they never expire! We tried to inform her of this, and come to find out, she was also a manager that didn't know this information! Her customer service skills were horrible and she didn't even apologize but instead made the drinks and had this attitude like she was doing me this huge favor. No thank you even when I still tipped her 20%. I understand she was trying to do her job but she could have done without all of the snobbiness.  I'm never coming back here again. The food was mediocre and my bagel was stale. The wait just isn't worth it. I recommend Morning Squeeze right up the street on Scottsdale rd.

I ordered the \"Pigs In A Bagel\" (Two eggs, peppered bacon & tomato topped with cheddar, served on your choice of bagel with herb potato & fresh fruit) and I also asked the waitress \"how do the EGGS come?\" And she said \"scrambled\" so I just thought it was going to be a bagel, with scrambled eggs, slices of bacon on top, tomato, and topped with the cheddar cheese. I get my \"sandwich\" and it's a little squished bagel with a gross omelette inside with tiny bits of bacon and tomato, like a drop of some white cheese, and some wilted lettuce, really un satisfying. The booth we were sitting at was so freezing that our food was cold within 5 minutes. The manager offered to get me something else so I just asked for a mixed berry smoothie to  go to play it safe. I thought it tasted kind of milky so I opened the lid and there was a huge pile of whip cream, yuck. Since when do breakfast sandwiches come with lettuce and smoothies come with whipped cream? Very strange. Our waitress also seemed like she could care less about us and I think we were there for almost 2 hours, super slow and ridiculous. Don't think I'll be going back there.",

Husband had the chorizo scramble which came on a large oval plate with potatoes, toast etc.  Looked great and got 5 stars from him.  I had the smoked salmon bennie, also delicious and very comparable to that served at many restaurants in nyc.  I usually stay away from breakfast fried potatoes, but these were excellent crispy on the outside and soft inside AND not greasy.  Coffee was especially good here; maybe they use the Starbucks from next door?",

They have happy hour from 4-8 and they have a pretty wide selection of items on the happy hour menu for you.   For food, we ordered the nachos, calamari and fish tacos. I LOVED the calamari. It comes with two types of sauce for you. A red chili sauce which I wasn't too fond of but I loved the chipotle mayonnaise sauce. The nachos were huge! It comes with the works. I mean the works, like everything! We couldn't even finish half of it. If you get the fish taco, get it grilled!   Drinks... I've never had a slushie long island before so I decided to test it out. Um, it was quite different. I think I'll stick to my long islands on the rocks. My sister ordered the spiced arnold palmer which was tasty.   I like how you can sit ANYWHERE for happy hour and that it doesn't end until 8 rather than 6 or 7. Some places you have to sit at a designated area for happy hour and it's first come first serve, which means harder to get a table.   The customer service was extremely friendly and great. The only negative I would say is that it took a bit long to get our food. However, I'll definitely be back for happy hour again! =)",

I'm a savory person and my husband is all about sweets so this restaurant allows us to both get what we want with their assorted menu.   My go to order is the Cobb sandwich with a bacon infused bloody Mary and a side of the chorizo mac. My husband always gets a chilled mocha with a pump of caramel and coconut substituted with almond milk (tastes just like a Samoa girl scout cookie) then he picks one of the sweet pancake items. The bacon infused bloody Mary is the best I've ever had. I've debated ordering a virgin one on mornings I'm not feeling a brunch cocktail.  On the slim chance that you have to wait to get in for longer than 15 minutes, they have complimentary coffee and cucumber water out front. When it is busy, the 2 of us normally don't wait longer than 15 minutes for first available seating. The longest wait I've dealt with was 30 minutes black Friday morning with a party of 6.   They also have a bunch of TVs all over the restaurant so we never have to miss a game. The patio one can even be watched while you wait for a table.   My one complaint is that the food service is not fast, but to keep my mind off that I just ask for the chorizo mac side as an appetizer so that we can snack on it while we wait for the main course and I hardly notice the wait.",

There was definitely a 20-30 minute wait on a Sunday morning.. Which is fine considering the place had awesome reviews. However when we sat down, the inside wasn't packed at all. There were quite a few tables opened actually.. So not sure why they kept everyone outside waiting.  The service was good.. Our server was nice and friendly.  The restaurant was clean.  I ordered the pumpkin latte and it was delicious!  But that's all.. The food was mediocre.  The chorizo Mac and cheese was spicy.. Nothing special about the flavors. The noodles felt a little over cooked and too soft.  There wasn't a great cheesy combo or flavor.. It just tasted like a chili mixed with noodles.  I wanted to try two different things and the waitress recommended I order one side of each so I could try both.. Glad I did because boy the side was huge! I had the banana bread French toast.. Big slice of banana bread.. With banana and pecans on top.  It tastes like it looks.. Soft and dense. Banana bread.. Nothing special.  The crunchy pumpkin pancakes was the other thing I wanted to try.. Super big pancake! As big as a large plate.  Again it was flat.. Doughy.. Not light and fluffy like I expected.  I think I liked this better out of the two but they both didn't stand out to me.. I was disappointed in how high it was rated for what I ordered and tried.  Probably wouldn't come back here.",

It definitely impressed me to hear how much she cared about my experience. She emphatically apologized, and said they strive to provide an excellent experience for their guests. She offered to make up for this experience by providing a complimentary lunch for both myself and a few coworkers. We ordered various things, and they were delicious and we had no complaints.   Everyone makes mistakes, and it speaks volumes to see the way an establishments handles them. A+ Daily Dose. You regained a lost customer.",

A little rich, but I expected that.  I highly recommend if you're looking for an unusual spin on the traditional dish.  My husband had straight shooter and he really engoyee the bacon in his meal. He says it was \"crispy and chewy at the same time.\"  I also tried a double strawberry mimosa and it was delicious! Fresh strawberry nectar!   And last but not least....our waitress, Sass, was such a genuine and sweet soul. She was so knowledgeable and kind and we really loved chatting with her. I also enjoyed how she treated our table saying, \"....you look like beautiful people. \" Such a happy thing to hear.  Highly recommend visiting this place.

A little bit of a wait as it was Saturday morning, but we were seated in about 20 minutes and the very good complimentary coffee was a big bonus while we waited! Seated at the bar we got a good view of a lot of meals and brunch drinks and started to get excited. We ended up with a grapefruit IPA, a bloody Maria, the pulled chicken benedict and a cinnamon roll pancake on the side and everything was delicious. The horseradish hollandaise and pretzel with the bene were a great twist and very fresh. The pancake was loaded with cinnamon sugar, just caramelized around the edges which I COULD NOT stop eating was beyond perfect.  The house made bloody mixes are amazing and the staff were all super friendly and prompt. Definitely will be back on our next visit!",

Little touches, like the water and coffee at the hostess stand to make the wait more comfortable. They pour you water in a glass at the table and then leave a carafe so you can keep on that water without hassle. They got the hydration down.  Wife ordered some sort of pancakes with granola and blueberries.  It was bomb.  It came with some sort of potato hash. Bomb.  I ordered chicken and waffles which also came with egg and potatoes. Bomb ba-ba-bomb ba-bomb ba-bomb bomb.  Prices are extremely reasonable. Sure, you can run up a nice brunch tab with Bloody Marys and spiked coffee real easily or you can get in and out for 2 on $25 during their mid-day happy hour.   Quickly becoming regulars here.",

They do not take reservations so try to get there early to get your name on the waiting list (and yes, there is usually a wait but it's worth it). While you're waiting, enjoy the complimentary coffee or infused water which is a really nice touch.   Depending on how hungry you are, try out my go to ordering technique - some sort of healthy egg white entree with a pancake on the side (for your guilty side). I got the egg white omelette with a side of fresh fruit, which was delicious, and followed that up with a side order of the cinnamon roll pancake. IT WAS INSANE. This is a warning, if you like cinnamon rolls, you will love this pancake. And you will feel horrible and super guilty later, but it's so worth it. Plus, eating something healthy before kind of offsets the damage, right? And it's actually a cheaper option than getting one of the more expensive entrees.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is fantastic and lively, the servers are phenomenal, and I like that they often have themed menu items if their is a holiday coming up.",

The food has potential based on the quality of ingredients...but the overall execution wasn't all that good (yet). The service was friendly too.  Room For Improvement: They need more contrast of flavors in their dishes. A heat to go with the sweet. And/or fresh to compliment the rich. I ordered the Hangover sandwich and it was all rich (with no fresh element in the sandwich to counteract) and mostly sweet-tasting (with no heat to offset it). So, it really seemed lackluster to me. Also, the eggs were overcooked. Oh, and a mist-machine for dining outside would be nice too.  Overall: I wish this place well, but there are just too many other options out there for me to be back to Daily Dose.",

Yeh, you should really try the last. If you like chorizo you will surely enjoy the benedict dish. My bf always gets the breakfast nachos which I have to say are pretty darn yummy! The nachos consist of chorizo, egg, tomatoes...and all kinds of good stuff.  Plus for us that they allow dogs on the patio. Most the time it is a bit tight with our 2 dogs on a busy weekend but today (sunday) we arrived at 7 a.m. and had the patio to ourselves.  Service is at a decent pace any faster and I would feel rushed. Any slower and I would give this place 4 stars.  Servers are friendly enough.  We have also been here for lunch which is just as nice with good options. I had a strawberry chicken salad, tasty. Only complaint chicken was on the dry side.   Overall, DD is consistent and that I like. We know we can expect yumminess every time we visit.",

I am definitely a fan of their food but their service can be better...I give them 4 stars for their food but only 2 stars for their service as their staff has always seemed to be sitting around by the bar and watching TV amongst each other on  all 3 of my visits ( no host/ greeter at the door until requested ...)   I have introduced my friends and brother to this place and been there about 3 times for their huge mouthwatering burgers!   I have tried a Chinese chicken salad and a crab-cake sandwich which I would rate as average ..... this is a place that stands out purely for their burgers I would emphasize",

The staff is some of the most hardworking employees I have ever seen, and they work as a team to make sure every customer in the entire place is taken care of. They never stop moving! It is super clean which is always very important, and decorated so that bar rescue host Jon Taffer would be truly impressed. But the best part of DD, is how fresh and amazing their food is. The owners have clearly chosen a menu and ordered ingredients so that no matter the dish, it comes out with attention to detail and taste each time. I usually get the same thing but have come with many friends and have heard nothing but rave reviews. They also serve a variety of lunch items, but I recommend trying them for breakfast. For your first time here I would suggest coming during the week if possible as they have a pretty long wait on the weekends. If you are just swinging by you may like hopping up to the bar where Sylvia or Jess will take good care of you. But the whole staff is exceptional and I love seeing their smiling faces every time I stop in. Enjoy!",

I went here with my family a couple of times while they were in town and it has good ambiance, it didn't feel awkward bringing a one-year-old here, and it was a pleasant experience. The service is good and timely and the only thing lacking is the limited selection of sugar-free flavors for espresso drinks. The French toast is delicious, great omelets, good potatoes, and a great veggie burger. They have a good menu and everything sounded good. A pleasant experience.",

Thank goodness! We were promptly seated and received refreshing cucumber water and adult beverages. The waitress was nice, but could have been more attentive.  We were present during Happy Hour. Started with the Chicken Nachos... So good! Definitely a big enough portion for a meal! Also, I ordered the traditional Kobe burger. The waitress was helpful and honored my request to it get my burger on a bun (although it is served on a pretzel bun, which sounds amazing!) without looking at me weird or asking questions as many restaurants do :(. Had a nice male waiter come fill my water while waitress was busy. He was personable and very polite; I appreciated the fact that he took the time to talk to me!  The food was great and besides some noisy cars on the road, a great atmosphere!",

    "text": "I can see why this place is named Daily Dose because I would probably eat lunch here everyday if I lived in the area.  My friend and I had \"girls afternoon\" and stopped in for lunch.  The place isn't very big and has a great vibe to it.  Dim lighting, oversized booths on one side, and some smaller tables in the bar area.  We opted to sit at the bar.  The bartender was friendly, answered all of our questions, and let us sample the homemade sangria.  For drinks we ordered a double bellini and for $8.50, it was a decent sized drink!    We started with a Caesar salad and it was just ok.  The lettuce didn't seem too fresh.  For lunch we both ordered the same thing.  I wish we would have ordered different things just because there was so much on the menu that I would have loved to try!  We went with the Chicken Cobb Sandwich.  Grilled chicken, bacon, avocado, and creamy blue cheese.  When I first saw it on the menu and saw blue cheese, I was thinking it was going to be blue cheese dressing, but it wasn't!  Instead it was thick and creamy.  The sandwich is huge and it is difficult to eat because it can get messy with the blue cheese oozing out.  It was delicious though!  I went with the sweet potato fries as my side and they did not disappoint!  From the looks of the menu, this place has a killer happy hour!  I would love to try it out when I am back in the Scottsdale area.",

The Mahi-Mahi was cubed with lettuce tomato's and avocados over a flat bread. I didn't eat all the flat bread but folded it and took a few bites, very tasty & healthy. Then I polished the fish and ate 1/2 my fries.   Then went back the next day for breakfast. Had a egg-white omelet with spinach and mushrooms - and it came with homestyle potatos and a butternut squash hash. One of the BEST breakfasts in months! Decaf coffee was good too!! I think my breakfast bill was almost as much as my lunch bill ~ $17+ so not the cheapest breakfast but I'll reluctantly pay to get my day started off on the right foot and w/ this healthier option.",

    "text": "The food here is amazing! There are plenty of options for the whole family.  The workers are friendly and quick to get the drinks and food out. Unfortunately my family and I came here during a busy Saturday morning around 9 am. We knew this place would be busy but didn't realize just how busy it really was going to be. We checked in and were told around 35 to 45 minute wait. After an hour of hearing tons of names being called and people going in, we noticed a few group go in that arrived after us. We went inside to ask and were told they had called our name and we didn't come forward so they scratched us off.  I know this is not possible because I had a party of 5 all waiting, and all listening for the same name, which was never called.  Luckily they were very understanding and quickly turned a 4 person table into a 5 person table and sat us quickly after the confusion.  Without this experience I would have given a 5 star review because they really are a delicious breakfast place!",

Staff was friendly and we were seated on the patio as requested with only a short wait. Nice atmosphere and service. My daughter and I split the sirloin steak eggs Benedict with butternut squash as a side.  The eggs were very underdone that even the egg white were runny in spots. The sirloin steak was actually a little thicker than deli meat and had a very bland taste. When looking at the bottom of the meat there was a slight mother of pearl coloring. Squash was a lot like the potatoes-very bland. Did not complain to waiter.",

Why yes! I would love something to drink! The thought thrilled me. He was thrilled too.  Next thing you know, max brought me my drink! I really recommend the pomegranate green tea.

Still she poured me a beer and a water, so I was fine with the wait! The bar is open at 7 am along with the restaurant which is nice for shift workers like myself! A decent selection of beers, mamosas and other crafty cocktails! You can get a full bottle of champagne and choice of juice for $20. I ordered the Gladiator Burger which comes with grilled onions and jalapenos, I ordered it with onion rings! The food came out relatively quickly and was served hot and fresh, the onion rings were hot and fresh as well, but I wasn't impressed with the corn meal batter which was gritty and rather bland and just too heavy! The onions inside however were sweet and delicious! My Burger was slightly over cooked but it was still juicy and tender, although it could use a bit more seasoning! I ordered it on Rye Bread which is my go to way to eat burgers, and the bread was fresh and delicious! Overall the meal was solid, and I like that I could order from the lunch menu and have a beer at 7am! I would definitely come again, as I left full and happy!",

On the weekends it can get busy but we've never come and it's been so slammed we went somewhere else. On a Saturday we'll maybe wait 15 mins tops. Since we've been here so often we've almost tried everything on the menu. I've had every pancake/french toast and they're all amazing. My favorite is the banana bread french toast, and on a day I want something less sweet I go with the protein pancakes. The burgers are all really good, and the savory breakfast items are awesome. My boyfriend usually gets a breakfast bowl/omelette or an eggs Benedict. Once again all that stuff has been great. I enjoy their unique sodas and teas. Their mixed drinks are also good. They have a happy hour Mon-Fri I think 12-3 (double check that) so drinking and getting food isn't too expensive. The staff are nice and talkative.  The only thing negative I could say about this place is that some times it takes a super long time to get the check and then to pay. Besides that I have never had a bad experience here",

    "text": "My favorite meal is breakfast, Daily Dose is one of my favorite breakfast places, whenever I have the time and the option to have breakfast the first place that comes to mind is Daily Dose.   I really recommend the breakfast burger or the chicken waffles. I get regular waffles, not the cornbread ones. The bacon mimosa is so yummy!  Management is great! The guy is personable and treats costumers with respect. He really stands high.   If you like a quick meal and be served fast go to the bar, the Spanish speaking girl is so good.   Service at other tables takes a long wait, seems like needs a better communication between the host and the servers. Today was the example, got a table and waited for 10 minutes, no water, not an acknowledgment just like a simple \"I will be with you in a second\". I was disappointed and walked away. I am giving three stars because this is not the first time service has been mediocre.",

I mean there aren't many places that will give you potatoes + another side + another side with your omelette. Super awesome that you can get 2 meals out of what ever you order! It's also very reasonably priced. I always have a great experience when I come here. Good and FAST service, fun vibes (my favorite part), and their bar is to die for.   My only reason for 4 stars is because I'm not the biggest fan of what I ordered. It was still good - but it wasn't for me... If that makes sense. After trying what my friends ordered: cinnamon roll pancakes (um wow), maple almond french toast (double wow) - my omelette was just ok. We also ordered the breakfast nachos and ummmm triple wow (hope you saw that coming).  Definitely give Daily Dose a try, you won't leave hungry or disappointed I promise.",

It took around twenty minutes to even order a couple bloody Mary's, and we had to keep flagging the waiter to finally get our food order. The BM's were tasty, but the chicken and waffles had much to be desired. The chicken itself was prepared well, but the waffle was lacking in culinary inspiration. They were dry and bland, reminiscent of a DIY waffle maker station at a hotel breakfast. I'm not sure why they serve it with an egg and roasted corn, it makes for a bizarre flavor profile. I might go back in the future for drinks but that's about it.",

The veggie pot pie is something I will probably try next time, but I'll probably make sure I'm not the DD so I can have another bellini! The atmosphere is laid back and pleasant- we sat outside.

Good size, shrimp were smaller, avocado was fresh.  - Chicken Blue cheese slider: huge portion for 4 bucks.  Big half sandwich and full side of sweet potato fries.  Served on pretzel baguette, but I didn't taste much pretzel.  - Calamari:  A knock out.  They should put THAT in the taco  - Guac : Delish.  Great portion for the price.  All in all we left stuffed and I feel like we got good value.  The service was attentive and polite.  no attitude here.

It is a popular place as realized by our 30min wait time and the group of people putting their name down for a table. We hung outside near the patio and admired all of the food they were bringing out.   After we were seated, we perused the menu and I decided on the California club on a pretzel roll. I have to say that I'm not a fan of cucumber water, but that's a minor issue. Everyone's food came out and it looked really good. My sandwich was average, I thought the pretzel roll overwhelmed the flavor of the sandwich, and I ended up adding hot sauce to add some taste to everything. This is a really cute place though (much bigger than the outside lets on), and I would definitely give it a second try.",

I had the caprese grilled cheese, which was a unique take on two of my faves - grilled cheese and caprese salad.  and judging by my empty plate, it worked.  i chose a salad as my side and was grateful and duly impressed by the thought and creativity that they put into it - rather than most places that just throw some sad, lonely lettuce on a plate and call it a side salad.  one of my companions managed to finish \"the gladiator\" and mumbled \"very good\" right before he passed out.  other companion just had beer, but was impressed with the selection.  all in all, daily dose has it figured out.  they are a bright spot in the otherwise soul-less \"old town\" of scottsdale.  it is definitely worth the wait you will inevitably have - because the word is out!",

    "text": "My boyfriend's sister wanted to have lunch here on her break from work today. We had to drive for a minute to find parking on the side street and walk the rest of the way which wasn't horrible since it was nice outside.  I found it kind of odd that there are two restaurants here and both have outside seating and the main doors are right next to each other? I could see how someone could misunderstand and assume it was one restaurant if they weren't paying attention. Also a women working at the place next door greeted us as we passed on our way to enter Daily Dose, it almost made me feel bad for not picking them or something!  Once inside we were sat right away in a nice booth even though most the tables were full. Our waitress came by and got our drink orders and we needed a few minutes to look through the menu. I had the roasted turkey omelet with tomatoes onions and brie, and it came with potatoes, toast, and I chose the squash hash for the extra side.  Before our food came I went to the restroom to wash my hands and didn't like how the bathroom doors and the entrance to the kitchen are literally right next to each other. First off this is kind of gross. Second when you are walking to the bathroom there are people coming in and out of the kitchen so you are in their way. Not very appealing.  The food came and my plate was loaded. I tried the squash first and it was buttery and sweet with a little saltiness. I was sad to see only one or two mushroom slices, not like the pictures I've seen here where it looks like there are just as many mushrooms as there is squash.  Sourdough toast was alright, nothing special. I asked for jelly and they brought out a container of home made stuff that wasn't really sweet or tangy at all. Just bland.  My two real problems were the potatoes and omelet itself. The potatoes were just greasy and had no real flavor besides grease. The omelet after one bite I noticed a distinct taste of fish! I would say Salmon or something similar. But it was just awful, I couldn't taste turkey, barely even the egg. Just fish. I could tell it was indeed the turkey omelet because I saw the turkey slices, and tomato bits. But I even had my boyfriend try it and he said he could definitely taste fish and there was a bad aftertaste too. I really didn't want to complain and send my food back for something else because 1. I've worked in restaurants before, and 2. His sister had to get back to work and ordering something else would have taken awhile. So I left most of the fishy omelet on my plate, and had the squash and some of the toast.  My bf ordered the gladiator burger and I had a bite and thought it was interesting. It was good but the bun or something added way too much sweetness, it almost seemed like a dessert.  If for some reason we ever come back here I will order something else and hopefully have a better experience. Until then, I give it barely 3 stars!  P.S. The music playing on their website is just cheesy. Jack Johnson? Really? Lol!",

We'll be back, I would love to try some of the other speciality items on the menu.",

They always seem packed so arriving right at lunch time is hit or miss. The menu is huge, so no matter what you like, you will find something. Interestingly, service is a mixed bag. Some of their waiters/waitresses are very attentive and on the ball, others disappear and a manager figure fills in for them.   One thing that does impress me about this place, is the feedback they seek from their customers on basically every visit. There are two individuals, one woman and one man, that often visit and ask for honest feedback on the food and how our service has been so far. That's a good sign. I'm always for holding people accountable.   Try it out. It's never disappointing, price is what you'd pay anywhere else in Scottsdale.",

The iced tea and coffee table was a nice courtesy for those waiting for a table.  Once we got in, we sat at the bar, which was fun because we got to watch all the action. The decor was beautiful, and it felt so posh to sip my mimosa at the bar.   The food was also great! Mom and I each ordered a variation on eggs benedict (red pepper and black forest ham) and shared. Both were delicious, flavorful, and not too heavy. I finished my plate without feeling weighed down.   All in all, this was such a lovely brunch experience. Thank you, Daily Dose!",

When my food came out it looked wonderful and I started to eat when I noticed a piece of blonde hair intertwined in the potatoes. Just a sidenote I have black hair and it definitely was not mine. The service was slow to begin with but I sat and waited for our server to come back so I could tell her and send it back however she didn't come back for quite a while so my husband went to find her to let them know, specially because he was already done with his meal at this time. Somebody came out took the plate and asked if I wanted another omelette, at that point I was too disgusted and I just politely said no thank you. The manager came out and he was polite and apologized and ask if there's anything at all that he can do for us at that point we said no were fine and we just wanted to leave so I asked if we could have our bill. Our server finally came back and we asked her for the bill and if I could order a coffee to go. That also Took a very long time to get to us. She then brought a second check out for the cup of coffee that I ordered for five dollars. I'm disgusted with the food with the service and the fact that they charged us for a cup of coffee which is the principal not the cost. Our meal was $26 without the tip and that was only for my husband's plate an ice tea and a side of bacon. They did take my meal of the bill ( as they should've) but this was A bad experience altogether. I will not go here ever again and it's too bad because we would frequent this place a lot. Never again!",

    "text": "My husband first took me to this restaurant over two years ago.  It is a hip little place that has both inside and outside seating.  We have only been there for breakfast and lunch, but that's okay because the food is great!  The menu is diverse without being overwhelming.  Sometimes you try a place that mixes flavors that just shouldn't be together.  At first, I thought this might be the case at DD, but not so.  I suggest you set your volume on adventure and jump in.  Try the place a few time, with different dishes each time.    I have tried most of their omelets, except for the tempeh and grains, greens and beans, and the crabby (shellfish allergy).  My favorite is the Lox omelet.  I like it with the Lox inside the omelet with the cream cheese mixed with the eggs.  I also like a side of hollandaise sauce to pour over top. Mmmmm... Always go for the DD hash on the side of anything you order. Don't ask, just do it.  There are three breakfast bowls and I only go with two.  Hint: I am not a big fan of tempeh and baby kale. Pancakes!!  My only other favorite place for pancakes is First Watch's and their carrot cake pancakes.  The cinnamon roll pancakes at DD are enough to send me into a food coma just from the shear smell.  Incredible! French Toast?  Yes, please!  Their banana bread french toast are so good.  We get a plate and share between 4 people.  They are incredibly delicious; like a Saturday treat for a week well done. The waffles are amazing.  The peanut butter and jelly sound interesting?  They are actually really yummy! There are a few dishes worth mentioning on their specialty item section. Take a chance and try the Southwest wrap, the Hangover sandwich or the Southwest Flannel Hash.  You might find a favorite.  Daily Dose has become a wonderful addition to a restaurant repertoire.  This is now a place that we regularly meet friends on an early Saturday morning, to talk, eat, and relax a nice chill setting.  We love this place and that won't change anytime soon.",

I was given a choice of 3 different sides (hash, cottage cheese, or fruit).  None of those sounded appealing so I requested 2 eggs as a replacement. I was told that they wouldn't do a substitution and I had to choose between the 3 options because eggs were more expensive. Eggs are not more expensive (according to their menu) which I immediately pointed out,  but there was no budging the person who was taking my order. I had to take 1 of the 3 options and make a separate side order for what I wanted (eggs or bacon) even though they had a lower menu price.  I said \"thanks but no-thanks\" and hung up the phone.

Unfortunately, I will have to say that this morning's breakfast of biscuits and gravy and a platter of peach creme brulee pancakes didn't have us leaving w/ happy stomachs :(    There were a couple of hitches, but these were easily amended.  (I think my love affair of DD's biscuit and gravy has ended.)  My major gripe was that our gingerbread pancakes did not contain candied ginger pieces-- did Daily Dose switch to a new mix/formulation?  If yes, please switch back!  The pancakes we had today were too dense and not at all the flavorful-spicy and texturally-exciting cakes we've had in the past :(  The peach creme brulee sauce also didn't arrive warmed, and instead was squeezed unappetizingly onto a sauce dish.  The leftovers that I usually get to enjoy again on one of my work breaks ended up in the trash.  I'm going to go back again soon to give DD another try... I'd like to keep it on my list of fave brekky places!",

The omelet came with two nice size crab cakes. Way too much food but good and filling.  We also had the Lox omelet, which came with loads of smoked salmon.

The host was respectful and nice and our server was a very cool lady that helped us pick out some items both times, because we were pretty unfamiliar.  Good breakfast and lunch joint. First time we came, I had the chorizo eggs benedict. The hash was squash or something, I don't recall. I had a side of sweet potato fries. I didn't even finish the plate. It was a lot of food and very presentable.  A lot of people always compare breakfast joints to Dennys, saying they could have gotten the same taste. I mostly agree... with breakfast, it's usually a similar process but you will never get food as pretty as this at a Dennys. The squash hash is very good but very, very sweet.  Second time I was really hungry, so I got the Daily Dose burger. I never order burgers because fast food turned me off of them but this was good. It was so big I had to eat the toppings and meat in sections!  We never waited. We usually came around 2ish and were seated right away. This would be five stars with all the great service and accommodations but the food didn't blow me away. It was good but standard, for the most part.",

The menu offered a wide variety but with out it being too overbearing with so many options.  My wife ordered the Smokey stuffed Portabella Mushrooms and I had the Turkey Sausage & White out.  They both came with a side of toast of your choice and a very generous bowl of mix fruit.  My liked her order, but wished the cheese had been melted all the way. I thought my order was boring, just a egg white omelets with chopped turkey sausage & cheese.  I would note that the locally made turkey sausage was very tasty!  And the fruit was great, not at of the can.  I actually couldn't believe the size they give you.  I wasn't the typical 3 grapes, a piece of pineapple, and a piece of melon!  :D  The service here seems to be pretty good.  Unfortunately, our server wasn't so much!  She seemed more interested in getting back to the hostess desk and talking with the other servers.  When asked about a few of the items of the menu, her answered was rushed, quick and without thought.   The Price was fit just right, nothing we saw was outrageous.    The atmosphere very nice. It had a nice interior, bar, indoor/outdoor dinning areas (with a big screen TV showing EPSN Sportcenter :D).  It definitely a place I would consider for happy hour. Very clean.    Parking could be a bit of a issue I would imagine for lunch, dinner, and weekends due to the location being in Ole Scottsdale.  But there was a few parking lots located right around the corner.  Overall, I thought the place was decent.  Would go back for lunch or dinner if in the area again.  But will make sure I do not get the same server again.",

FOOD:  We had the famous pretzel bun burger w/fries and the Ancho Chile Reuben w/combo fries. Both were totally De-Lish!  The bacon on the burger was 100% real and cooked on a grill, just like home.  Also the red pepper aioli and bits of basil leaf added a subtle new flavor to the same ol'burger.  Burger was cooked as ordered: a beautiful med. rare.  The Ancho Chile Reuben was HUGE!  Tasty with only a hint of zing.  Crispy fries rounded out the huge plates & portions are large so come hungry (combo fries are the crispy fries and sweet potato fries mixed in together- great for sharing).  We had tea as a beverage - fresh brewed and excellent.  SERVICE:  Everything was great -with one exception:  our waiter never asked us if we wanted more tea.  He was back several times - asked if we wanted dessert, etc.  He was nice, friendly, pleasant & accomodating when we needed an extra minute to decide on our order. But, not offering a refill on the drinks (the glasses were empty before our plates were) made a difference for us in the tip:  would have been 20% but instead left only about 16%.  OVERALL:  We did not have a long wait time as others described.  May be because we were there at 3:45 p.m. on a weekend and not a busy meal hour during the work week. Food was absolutely excellent and we will definitely be back - gotta try the Breakfast Nachos!",

When I ordered extra bacon it cost $3.54, for three pieces of bacon. Not happy that a BLT now cost me $13.53. To the manager, please Don't be cheap with the bacon, it makes your nice restaurant low end.   On the positive side I had the burger and it was very tasty. My wife did like her BLT, but  won't order it again. I would have given this place 4 stars if not for the bacon.",

    "text": "I've been to The Daily Dose five times. Whenever I visit family in Phoenix, I insist on going. The portions are large, the selections are interesting, the execution good, and the service left little to be desired for. My fifth visit, however, will likely be my last, at least until I give other breakfast places a try. I'm not one to bone-pick about a restaurant being out of a certain menu item (even though, having worked in lots of restaurants, I should sink my teeth into them), but it was more logic, or lack thereof, that makes me want to share the explanation that was given for being out of the gingerbread pancakes. See, they were for Halloween and were replaced by snickerdoodle pancakes. My visit having taken place on December 22, I must have been crazy to think they would have gingerbread three days before Christmas, or that it would be a business strategy to extend their availability through the Christmas season.  I'm a culinary pioneer, so I ordered the snickerdoodle replacement, also at the recommendation of the server. I hate using superlatives, unless I'm talking about Michael Jordan or Bob Dylan, but these were the worst pancakes I have ever had! They were bone-dry, tough, flavorless, with the exception of the bitterness coming from the excessive amount of ground spices in the batter. Snickerdoodle cookies are the ones sprinkled liberally with cinnamon and sugar. The cook at The Daily Dose must not be aware of the desiccant properties of spices. I refer him/her, then, to the \"Cinnamon Challenge.\" Like the ice bucket challenge, the lesser known cinnamon challenge calls on the highly suggestible individual to eat a spoonful of cinnamon...the spice quickly dries out the mouth and can cause asphyxiation. I didn't choke on my pancakes because I chased them with the tepid coffee refills I got after waiting with an empty cup. But the fact that I, renowned (amongst my friends and family) for being able to down sickening quantities of food, left nearly two of the three pancakes on my plate, waving the white flag, tells you that they were bad. The over-spicing completely dried them out, and the frosting on top, laced with more spices, could not compensate.   It was an unfortunate experience to be served lukewarm coffee, intermittently, and to have a bad meal all in the same visit. My company that morning, ordering eggs Benedict, was faced with undercooked egg white, a food touted by cooks to be one of the most disgusting things one can serve.   It was unfortunate, more for the restaurant than me, for all of these mishaps to happen on the same visit. I align my expectations with the self-proclaimed reputations of restaurants and the fare they serve. If you're a breakfast place that screws up pancakes, it is time to 'take the whole thing back to formula'.",

    "text": "The food here is consistently REALLY GOOD.  It's nothing fancy - burgers, salads, etc - and the decor is pretty marginal.  But that aside, it is one of my favorite places to go with my husband when we just want a simple, delicious meal without all of the hoopla of getting dressed to \"go out\".  We usually just skip past the hostess and sit and the bar and watch a football or basketball game, and the staff has always been friendly (although when we do actually sit at a table they could be a bit more attentive).  Also, I've yet to have something I dislike, but the favorites have to be any salad with their house dressing (cilantro-lime) and my husband loves the gladiator burger on the pretzel bun.  The fish and chips are amazing entirely because of the slaw they serve with it - no mayo, all yummy vinegar-y spicy-ness.  I would buy that stuff by the gallon if they'd sell it to me.   Reason for only 3 stars: Sometimes the staff is a little TOO comfortable.  If there aren't a lot of patrons in the restaurant, they will just have their conversations (usually gossip) right over your head - one even belched while we were at the bar.    Another slight downside -  they play annoying top 40.  Overall - a great place for a tasty meal with an easy feel.",

The girl who originally took our name came over with an attitude and said that we couldn't sit there unless they sat us there.

The \"appetizer\" was a plate big enough to feed three hungry females and STILL have leftovers.   I'm super picky when I order anything and all of my orders end up being a complicated mess (Can you substitute this? Can I have this on the side? I need dipping sauce.) Our waitress - I'm so bummed I can't remember her name - was the sweetest lady. She was so patient with me and brought out the food exactly how I wanted to see it. Everything was incredibly delicious, too.  Then, to top it all off, apparently they were closing early for their company holiday party. We started noticing people disappearing from the restaurant and we asked the manager if they were closing, to which he replied, \"yes, we closed at 2pm.\" It was 3:30 when we looked at the clock and I couldn't believe it! They let us sit and enjoy our meal without making us feel rushed or even mentioning their early closing time. That was stellar customer service and I would give them 10 stars for that if I could.  Try this place - you will LOVE it.",

We were originally seated in a booth which was cool until we found ourselves peering around the restaurant wondering where our server was to take our drink order. After about ten minutes we decided to just go ahead and sit at the bar for faster service.   The bartender was great, super friendly and prompt in taking our drink order and getting us menus. He seemed knowledgeable about the menu as well which was reassuring. I ordered the vegetable nicoise salad and my bf had the gladiator burger. Food was very satisfying and we were both very pleased with the portion size of both selections. I highly recommend the salad, only downside was a non tossed salad but beautifully presented nonetheless.   As we were presented with the bill, we decided to grab drinks to go, I ordered an iced latte and my bf a hot tea. Seeing as how this place has a giant espresso machine in the middle of the restaurant and advertises having great coffee I figure I have to give it a shot. As I watched the server prepare my drink I saw him grab for a red and white 20 oz Coca Cola to go cup, something that you would see being served at a fast paced pizza place. Anyway, since my latte is $5+ I'm expecting a suitable to go cup for my drink, I'm not asking for anything fancy but I kind of am. A clear cup would do. You'd think they would have cups with their logo on it even. I don't think I'm being out line for docking them points for this but it was offensive to receive my tasty latte in that kind of cup. Just didn't make sense. I will go back but not for the coffee to go.",

I hate egg yokes so I ordered a sausage and polenta bowl with scrambled egg whites. When it arrived  I wasn't sure what I was looking at but, an over easy egg goo'd all over my food. I can't. No. There was also, no turkey. The waitress came over and took my plate away. She came back 30 seconds later. The wrong breakfast was delivered by a food runner. Much better! As I was leaving, I dropped about $200 in the booth. An hour later I realized what happened, I called and it had been turned in! Almost restored my faith in humanity! Now, the reason for 4 stars. About 30 minutes after eating, my husband got very sick. Very sick. He was fine up to that point and he's better now. 6 hours later, we went to the Giants game, he missed the beginning, and we left in the 5th because he wasn't feeling great. Stay away from the crab.",

    "text": "After my wife and I finished our hike at Camelback Mountain, we were both really hungry so we searched Yelp for a great brunch people in Scottsdale. I am glad we chose Daily Dose because we really enjoyed the food there.  It was a Saturday morning around 10:30 AM, so there was a bit of a crowd. Thankfully, the waiting area has coffee that you can help yourself to while you wait. They told us our table would be ready in about 15 minutes, and we were seated about ten minutes later.  When I saw the Breakfast Nachos (served with a side of sausage gravy!) on the menu, I knew I wanted to order that. My wife chose the healthier option of the Turkey Sausage Whiteout, which is an egg white omelet with turkey sausage. I liked that their menu had a diverse selection of enticing dishes to appeal to all different types of customers.  The breakfast nachos were phenomenal! The chorizo was packed with flavor and a little bit spicy. The combination of the eggs, cheese, and tortilla chips was reminiscent of migas. While I didn't think that the sausage gravy really went with the chips/eggs/cheese, I enjoyed dipping the buttermilk biscuit that I ordered on the same into the gravy. Overall, this was a very tasty and filling meal. I didn't try any of my wife's omelet, but she said that it was excellent.   Overall, the food was outstanding, the service was great, and the atmosphere was relaxed and casual. This was the ideal recovery meal after going on a strenuous hike. We would definitely recommend Daily Dose if you are looking for a great brunch place in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "So glad I stopped into Daily Dose to get my brunch fix. I had come here with the intention of ordering something sweet but ended up on the opposite end of the spectrum. I don't know what it was, but the chorizo and jalapeno corncakes were calling my name and I'm SO happy I went with them. Unable to resist, I also ordered a side of a single biscuit and gravy - something I never, ever order but again, so happy I did. Upon receiving my plate of corncakes, I was a bit confused to see that a spicy, savory stack of pancakes came with a side of maple syrup and I skeptically drizzled a bit onto the cakes. However, it was delicious! The corncakes were perfectly spicy! The side of a biscuit and gravy was amazing as well! Our server, Laura, was attentive and super patient while we looked over the menu.   As far as parking goes, it appears that there's plenty around Daily Dose. I got super lucky today and managed to snag a spot just a tiny short walk next to Daily Dose. I could totally see having to really search for a decent parking spot on a busy weekend, so prepare yourself to be on the hunt!",

Upon our return, we received negative attitude from the host for leaving the waiting area. We then sat down in the cramped waiting area and waited for 40 additional minutes.  When we asked why a new arrival of 6 was seated before us. The hostess responds with contempt, \"because you left\".

I ordered the turkey Sausage and Polenta bowl. It was out of this world. I'm  a sucker for white beans and the eggs, Turkey Sausage and fried Polenta are served on a bed of the white beans. Absolutely delish dish.   Hubs had the Flannel Hash and he thoroughly enjoyed it especially since he loves corned beef.   I'd gladly go back for more. There was so much on the menu I'd like to try. Quite the selection of omelets, Benedicts and pancakes.   Being that it's in Old Town Scottsdale, you'll have lots to see before or after brunch too.   Check it out and let me know what you get!",

There was a bit of a wait, but no biggie. It was sunny, but a very strong cold wind was blowing. We ended up on the patio, but there was a heater, so it wasn't bad, but we did get a lot of wind. At one point, the wind blew off the table my tortilla for my dish.   I love green chilie pork and they had this great dish on the menu that included white beans, pork, with eggs and avocado. Sounded delish. It was mostly good. The flavors were there but sadly, the beans were not all the way cooked, they were way too firm still, and I couldn't eat them. But the chilie sauce and the eggs and the pork, in a tortilla were good. It was disappointing though, as the beans were a major component of the dish.  I also ordered one side pancake for my friend and I to share. It was almost like a crepe, it was that thin. It also was really rubbery. You couldn't cut through it with the fork. Very strange.  Service was outstanding though. When my tortilla flew off the table from the wind, she gladly got me another one. Our server was friendly and working hard.   Overall it was good, and I'd give them another chance, but someone should test the beans before they decide to serve them.",

My sister got a strawberry one and I got a ginger one. They looked so cute, but they were 90% champagne. Good if you're looking for a strong drink, but we were not haha. I was happy to see vegetarian friendly stuff marked on the menu! I got the tempeh breakfast burrito. My sister got the strawberry ginger granola. I was worried I wouldn't like my burrito due to past bad tempeh experiences, but it was quite delicious! I can't eat eggs anymore but miss enjoying delicious breakfast burritos, this hit the spot. I also got potatoes as my side, it was enough for me to share and tasted great when I added them to my burrito! My sister liked her granola too. And prices are reasonable! And servers are nice!

You wouldn't think that from the outside but it certainly is! The service is always great and everyone is super friendly. So for the meal, I get the power bowl which is super healthy. I've also had their omelets which were good as well. The portions are pretty spot on. I would recommend everyone trying this out especially during the week because it's more quiet and you can sit down immensely. During the weekends it's pretty crowded as you can see clearly driving by. If you haven't had it, give it a try.",

The corned beef hash with its jalapenos is perfectly southwestern and delicious. The service is quite good- but expect to wait a while, especially on weekends.   I'm less enthusiastic about the not breakfast options. The strawberry salad is good, but like most of their salads a bit too sweet. And I'm not a huge fan of their drinks, however my husband loves the bloody marys.   The outdoor, now DOG FRIENDLY, patio is my favorite thing about the Scottsdale location. Always new dogs to pet. This is a solid bet for breakfast and worth the wait.",

The omelets were pretty standard fair, but with big portions and cooked well.  This place really excels in the details more than anything else.  The water is infused with cucumber, which makes it refreshing and just that much more special.  With your meal, you get toast, potatoes and your choice of side, where most places make you opt out of potatoes if you want something else.  The meal came with a side of rosemary creme fraiche that was absolutely delicious.  I love rosemary and the condiment meshed well with both the omelet and potatoes and infused a rosemary tang.  The potatoes were cooked well, no soggy home fries here, and the fruit was a nice mix of watermelon, grapes, and pineapple.  But the real star of the show, and the reason I hope to eat here again is the jam.  Oh my goodness, this jam was homemade and absolutely excellent.  It was filled with fresh berries and elevated a normal piece of toast to epic proportions.  I want some more just thinking about it.  The food is solid, the staff attentive and friendly, and the jam phenomenal.",

This place had absolutely amazing (hangover) food.   I had to put a \"little hair of the dog\" and started off our visit with an Absolut Peppar Bloody Mary filled with yummy garnishes such as olives, lime, lemon, and cucs. I had such a hard time ordering and finding out what I wanted that Mom and I split a sweet and savory dish. We opted for the Blue Crab Benedict and the Peach Creme Brulee pancackes. Holy schnikes...it was amazeballs. Fresh grilled peaches nesteled between two fluffy pancakes with a creamy vanilla anglaise and fresh whipped cream. OMG it was delectable. The blue crab was fresh, sweet, and paired wonderfully with the creamy hollandaise sauce. It was perfection. My pancakes came with a choice of fresh fruit, DD hash, etc. I chose the DD hash (i.e. butternut squash perfectly seasoned); I, at first, was a bit concerned thinking it was corned beef hash. However, I was not that disappointed because the flavors of rosemary, paprika, and other flavors brought out the delicious flavors of the roasted squash.  I definitely will go back to Daily Dose when I'm in town. It's nestled in Old Towne, which is a fascinating part of town.",

There are a million amazing items on this menu that I want to try, and no, not just for breakfast, which they serve until 4 by the way. On weekdays. Did I tell you that already? Sorry, I might say it a few more times. I was torn between a few breakfast options and only glanced a bit at lunch, but it looked very tempting also.   We all I know I love me some eggs benedict, and the server insisted they have the best sauce around so I thought I'd give it a try. Probably should've gotten something else. I was not a fan of their benedict sauce at all. However, they do give you several options for the meat portion including salmon, and turkey sausage, which was what I tried, though it looked more like an actual piece of turkey rather than a sausage.  I wished someone had mentioned smoothies to me before I ordered my beverage too as they had a black cherry mint that I would've loved to try. Also on my list to try.. peach creme brulee :)  The service was great, the patio was beautiful, right down to the sexy tabletops and they even have free wifi apparently.  Not only have I found yet another breakfast on a weekday spot which I am going to frequently drag my coworkers to, but this should be a great place to chill if I ever have that awkward amount of time in between appointments and want a spot to get some work done and chill.  I do wish the servers did more to sell and give good recommendations though... they should stop recommending the eggs benedict.",

Occasionally, you have to wait at the front for someone to acknowledge you and finally seat you but the short wait is worth it!   They serve breakfast until 3pm during the week and ALL day on the weekends. I enjoy the eggwhite wrap and always look forward to the large breakfast potatoes. My favorite part about breakfast is the homemade jam they bring with toast! I also love their burgers! The food is well cooked, creative, and delicious.   They also have a wonderful happy hour that lasts until 8pm!  The specialty cocktails are clever but some of them are not well executed (too sweet).  I love sitting at the bar or out on the patio. The service is always friendly and everyone seems eager to please. They put cucumber slices in the water which makes the tap water actually taste GOOD. These small attentions to detail really add up and make this place one of my favorites! I drive down from North Scottsdale just to eat here!",

The patio is great, the food was great (I had biscuits and gravy plus 1 egg with sides of fruit and potatoes. They could have used more gravy buit that's because I am a pig!) My friend had the egg white veggie wrap and she loved it!). The water has a cucumber with appeals to me for some reason. The service was fantastic!! And this was noon on a Friday  in downtown Scottsdale, which is always packed on that day and time.  So they must have read all these other reviews and said \"WTF!\" We need to step up the service! Each of our bills came to under 9 bucks without tip. Biscuits and gravy without egg would have been 6.95. Compared to The breakfast Club, this place gets FIVE stars. Compared to my favorite place in Cave Creek, Oak Creeks Diner and Flapjacks, it gets 4 stars.  Will definitely go again!",

The fruit cups were great, packed full of fresh fruits.  The fried Potato's had the same taste as any other place I have tried, still good though. We had to wait a long period to get our coffee refilled and to get the check.  Overall the service was great in the beginning, as they did not want us to freeze (being by the patio door, only location open) which was helpful.  We were expecting exceptional for Scottsdale but got \"okay\" service.",

A few minutes after that the waitress finally came back with it and said \"oh you already got one.\" I then gave her the bill with my credit card. It took her awhile to come back with this too, and meanwhile our 1 year old is getting cranky and starting to cry. She finally comes back and says the card machine is down and it will be just a minute. After another 10 minutes passed we found the manager and he said they were working on it and it would be done shortly. Another 10 minutes went by and we grabbed him again and he brought us a piece of paper to sign and said he would run my tab later. Never apologized, didn't offer to comp any part of our meal. Nothing. And it took about 30-40 minutes from the time we asked for the bill until the time we left. All with a screaming baby.",

The service was great again. Ive been here a few times already, and not once i had bad service. Its a small restaurant, but surprisingly alot of seating. Theres also a bar if you want to enjoy a mimosa or bloody mary with your friends. Haha. Service though is always on point.   The food! Talk about good flavor! Ok presentation, but the flavors make up for everything and keeps your mouth shut. Sometimes you enjoy the flavor so much you dont want to talk. Lol.   The noise level is ok. Its not too loud, not too quiet. So you can definitely enjoy this place. I recommend all there eggs benedict, the banana french toast, and belgian waffles. Flavors flavors flavors. I guess i enjoy food maybe more then alot out there.   I gave four stars cuz i had better, but this is close to better for sure.",

I ordered the Eggs Benedict as that is my usual go to item at brunch...well both eggs were overcooked so it wasn't that good. We all kind of shared or had bites from the other dishes and they were all very good. My mom had the cinnamon roll pancakes, my brother had the berry protein pancakes and my brother's girlfriend and my dad got the turkey sausage omelet. Since the portions were quite big we all got to share it. Everyone else's food was much better than mine. I don't think I'll get the Eggs Benedict again from here as they were really overcooked.

My only complaint was the eggs benedict I ordered took too long to be served which resulted in overcooked eggs and lukewarm temperature. Even when you're crowded - orders should be served when they are ready - or perhaps the kitchen didn't signal it was ready.  Not sure who to blame, but it could have been better.",

Now maybe you think this attention to detail means higher prices, but let us assure you that Daily Dose is more than reasonable with lunch entrees almost all under $10 and dinner entrees under $12. Want an even better deal, stop by during Happy Hour from 4pm - 9pm during summer and you will find many wonderful things on the menu at a price that won't break the bank.  We stopped by last week during Happy Hour to check things out for ourselves and thought you might be interested in what we discovered. Now we like to think we know a thing or two about Happy Hour but we were overwhelmed by our choices on the Happy Hour menu. Can you say over 20 items specially priced just for Happy Hour?

I was told the wait would be 20min, but was seated in 10min, so that was a good start.   I had the Crabby Omelet ($11.99)-- a hefty red pepper and spinach omelet with 2 crab cakes sitting on top, 2 slices of sourdough toast, herb potatoes and the DD hash. The crab cakes were delicious, the omelet was filling, and i loved the sourdough toast.   My friend had the eggs benedict, which looked gorgeous. I'm gonna have to try it next time! I had a VERY long lunch there -- my friend and I ended up sitting there until 3:15pm chatting. Our waitress was wonderful! She told us that she's had patrons come and stay for all 3 meals, each for a different meeting.  The restaurant had a very cozy atmosphere and the menu had a lot of enticing choices. I spend so much time in my neck of the woods (Chandler) so it was nice to get out and find a good place in Scottsdale.",

I went in expecting nothing and that's about what I was given...again.  Believe it or not, the staff was rolling silverware again in the same area as my first visit. Unbelievable.  At least this time there was a seat available outside...far away from the clanking.  The service: Since I am a server, I don't bash other servers' \"styles\", but let's just say, our service was weird, not bad, just weird. Lingering stares, awkward silences, you get the picture.  Also, I have been serving for a long time and I still write stuff down.  No, I don't think you're cool if you can remember everything a table orders.  Just guarantee my food gets there the way I ordered it.  This particular time my salad came out loaded with raw onions, which I very clearly asked to be omitted. (I'll let you guess if she was writing it down).  The food: I am ironically thankful for the fact that the onions were left on my salad.  Because if they weren't there, I would have had a plate of flavorless lettuce and feta cheese.  Come on people.  I tried a difficult breakfast dish the first time I went, so I figured I'd order a common Mediterranean salad, just to give them a \"sure thing\" attempt.  Wrong. Yuck. Was there even dressing on that?  I'm gonna stop here before I continue beating a dead horse.",

The tables at the booths for four (and we were only two) were too narrow and I felt like I was in my husband's face as we ate across from each other.    My husband ordered the roast turkey omelet which came brimming with real turkey, tomatoes, onions and brie.  He said it was quite filling, but didn't make a fuss about the actual flavor. I ordered the meat and cheese omelet minus the chorizo and asked that my omelet be cooked on the soft side. It didn't come out that way, and much to my disappointment, the bacon they use is pepper bacon -- but they don't tell you that on the menu. I had to send it back. To their credit, they were gracious enough to take it off our bill.  What we most enjoyed was the DD Hash, a very tasty blend of butternut squash and onions, perfectly cooked. Absolutely delish! It's a little overkill with the breakfast potatoes that also come with the omelet. Start working on the DD Hash before you dig in to the others because they are so filling and yummy!  Our server was a little aloof, and one of her coworkers stepped up to the plate to better our experience. Had it not been for her assistance, I would surely have rated DD a two.",

    "text": "Great food. I love their food. But I need to make this very clear for fellow dog lovers. Though this restaurant can be listed as \"dog-friendly\" on some sites, they are more \"dog-tolerant\" and that's being generous. We brought out puppy husky to have lunch on the patio since they were listed as a dog-friendly restaurant. We were informed as we were sitting down after already placing our order that out dog had to sit outside the fence next to the table. This was a nightmare. Since our dog was a puppy at the time he whined and whined and whined because he wanted to sit at our feet. He constantly tried to climb back over to sit at our feet and the manager continually walked by the table to check under and make sure our husky was not lying at our feet. It made me and my friends tired and anxious to not only listen to the puppies whining and having to push him back outside the gates but to see the little male manager come out again and again to check under our table. We ended up scarfing whatever food we had so we could get out. The waiter was very sweet about the situation but I ended up irritated because we couldn't have the slightest bit of leeway and have the dog lay down under the table quietly instead of less than one foot away behind the fence. But other than that, great food and great service :P",

While sitting on the patio with a fubar of Yelpers I kept seeing the \"DD\" logo with it's overlapping D's and red background and thinking it looked really familiar.  Isn't that the logo for the Marvel comic DareDevil?  You remember that right?  Occasional guest in the Spiderman series, subject of yet another godawful Ben Affleck movie?  That DareDevil?  So these folks provided outstanding service (Thanks Tina!-she remembered every person by first name and even caught on when I was trying to slip my charges under Brian's name) and excellent food!  The Yelper special was a great bonus!  Thanks to Donald S for hooking up the UYE and the special with the owner!  I'm sure we made up for any loss from the special with lots of alcohol.  The burger (.5 Kobe beef, .5 high quality other beef) was really good and the pretzel style bun was a nice touch.",

I asked if I could get the discount and was told that I have to be in uniform... I thought they were joking, and the server asked the manager on duty to make sure. She arrived at our table to confirm that's their policy and with an attitude she said \"well, no one has ever complained about this before\". No one was complaining. We just asked about it. In my opinion, it's a silly policy, but I wasn't complaining.",

    "text": "I work three hops from the Daily Dose so I had to try it as one of my first ventures out at lunch time.  We went a a little early which is critical if you are in a hurry as this place gets packed - the kitchen is fast but you might have a wait for a table.  The first time, DS met me as he had a job interview (sigh....baby boy is growing up!) and we brought a cubbie buddy from work.    DH and I both had the Southwest Club Wrap,  It was a nice portion although I asked for mine without the guac and found the sandwich to be a tad dry.  I think I would have liked it better with a little something else to moisten it a bit. I expected it to have a bit more kick with the peppered bacon but it didn't.  So although it was a well-stuffed wrap, it was just boring to me and him (he did have the guac).   He had the pile of combo fries which he deemed to be quite tasty and I had the very generous cup of fresh fruit which was a nice mix of melon and pineapple.  Cubby buddy ordered her fav from there - the eggs Benedict with turkey sausage.  It is the only thing she orders there so, of course, the next time I went, that was on my list.  So here is visit #2 - I had to take a  new employee to lunch and it was on the boss' tab so back we came and I had my sights on those eggs.    Now they are worth coming back for!  I like eggs Benedict. Actually, unlike Julia Roberts in \"Runaway Bride\", I like eggs most any style but when you can take them and slather them with sauce well heck - they are just heavenly.  The Hollandaise is tasty - a little heavy handed but seriously that is what makes it so good.  And you will use that English muffin to sop up EVERY drop of it (before the days of YouTube, I would have licked that plate dry but you never know who is taping these days....). But what makes the eggs Benedict here is the turkey sausage.  I don't know whose they use - I am assuming they local source but maybe not - but it is just good. It is some of the best turkey sausage I have ever had - and I try it everywhere.  DH and I even buy our own spices and ground turkey and do our own in an attempt to make a really tasty sausage.  Whoever they use - it is good stuff - it is tasty like sausage but not overwhelmingly salty.  So now whenever I return to the DD, this is my go-to dish. Period.  It does come with the potatoes (meh - they are okay, nothing special) and I always opt for the fruit cup as it is fresh and a wonderfully sweet way to end a meal!",

So their happy hour goes (I think) from 4pm-8pm every day.   They have a lot of $5 options for food, and all hamburgers (made with yummy pretzels buns) are $3 off.  Warm Brie, nachos, guacamole and salsa for 3.5 and there is TON of guac.  I was shocked when I saw the portion.  Go here now before they raise their prices and change their happy hour menu.",

They have a huge menu and it took me a while to decide what I wanted to order but I went with the breakfast nachos which were absolutely enormous and he went with pancakes. My nachos were eggy and cheesy and yummy came with a gravy on the side which was good for dipping. All in all a solid spot to have a huge brunch or possibly come for after work drinks and food if I lived here.",

    "text": "Thank you to Check Please Arizona!   I saw Daily Dose on Check Please and just had to give it a try. Wow...the bust kept secret in Downtown Scottsdale for sure.   We arrived for lunch and actually got one of the last tables available. We were greeted warmly and our server took our drink order quickly. The menu is amazing! If there is not something on there that makes you quiver, then you must not be alive. My dining partner (out on our every Thursday lunch date) ordered the Grilled Chicken Cobb sandwich. She had pause as it's served on a Pretzel Bun. Oh girl please....hit the treadmill more in the morning! She was \"blown away\" loved, loved. loved her sandwich! I had the Turkey Burger. My felling is, if a restaurant is brave enough to put a Turkey Burger on their menu, they must know how to make it! They typically range from hockey pucks to bland indiscernible mystery substance. Not at the Daily Dose!!! Wow, Yumm, YAY!!!! is what my mouth was saying while devouring this burger! Such a great combination of flavors and yes, it's served on a pretzel bun as well...! The Combo Fries are the best. A combination of traditional russet potato fries and sweet potato fries. Such a great compliment to our sandwiches.   I can HIGHLY recommend The Daily Dose Old Town Bar and Grill. It's good service, GREAT food and very reasonably priced. So when you are near Scottsdale for Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner, you owe it to yourself to head, no RUN to Daily Dose.",

Service has been spotty (long wait times for intro/drinks, mid-meal, or bill time), no ice in drink or maybe a spot on a fork (immediate replacement with apologies and smiles)...but every single time I have been there, I was greeted at some point by the owner, and the food was ALWAYS consistently superior to any other breakfast place in Scottsdale. That is the one reason I continually come back. If they mess up my coffee, I know they will replace it with a smile and a meaningful apology. But if I order a turkey sausage omelet with DD hash on the side, it will always be delicious and spot on with no issues whatsoever.",

First of all in the service void of Old Town Scottsdale you can tell that the people at this place really care.  I have now become a bit of a regular there, but thats because the staff seemed to actually appreciate I was spending my precious few pesos with them instead of someone down the block.  So, I kept bringing my pesos their way.   I love the fact I always get a giant Ice Tea to go to keep me hydrated through-out my day.  The food is the other reason why I keep coming back.   Chock full of some unique options and always full of flavor, I now have about 5 things on my regular rotation.  The Hangover Breakfast Sandwich is still my morning staple.  Sweet turkey sausage, bacon, eggs your way, it is truly addictive.   The Prime Benedict is also delicious,, and filling.  No Matter what I get, I order up the Daily Dose hash as a side.     The place is clean and well kept, and there is a real feeling the people there enjoy their job and care about their little place.  They also serve lunch and dinner, and although that business piece has not taken off as much the food is just as good.    Definately a place to check out!",

The first thing that impressed us was that their were prices were much lower than typical restaurants in the area AND on top of that, their happy hour doesn't end until 8:00pm .. way later than most restaurants! We sat out on the patio & there was a TV screen that had a slideshow of some of their menu items, all which looked absolutely delicious! We ended up ordering the turkey burger with regular french fries & the gladiator with sweet potato fries. The burger was a little dry but tasted okay ... The fries were probably the best thing on the plate. Based on the uniqueness of the menu items, we were a little bit disappointed that the sweet potato fries didn't come with their own dipping sauce. I think they have a very extensive menu and as previously mentioned, their menu items are unique. I'd say that this is more of a hangout type place much like most places in Old Town, where you'd go to enjoy drinks & some appetizers. I'd probably stop by to try brunch as we've heard it's really good.",

When I dine at DD I'm typically in the mood for breakfast, so most of my recommendations come from that portion of the menu. Don't miss out on their bacon Bloody Mary, chorizo eggs Benedict, or peanut butter and jelly waffles.   Their burgers are really good too, and today I had the Old Town Stack (a prime rib sandwich with an onion slaw, horseradish mayo on a pretzel bun) that was pretty tasty.   A few parting comments: I hear they have happy hour from 4-9 Monday through Friday. That's insane (in a good way!) And, YES this place packs the house on the weekends, so be prepared to wait. But it's worth it.",

    "text": "I cannot begin to tell you how much I LOOOOVE this place. I literally go here every weekend for brunch/lunch. On Sundays the wait time for brunch can really get up there so I recommend going on an off day or later into the afternoon. This is a great spot to sip on a mimosa, enjoy brunch with friends, and see where your Saturday/Sunday will go!  Must haves: - Tacos (CHORIZO IS AMAZING, mahi mahi is good too) - Daily Dose burger (I DREAM ABOUT THIS THING... bacon, cheese, basil, chipotle aioli... combination of amazingness but beware you won't have any room to eat anything else for the rest of the day) - Shaved Turkey Melt (carmelized jalepenos and brie... need I say more???) - a healthy alternative = turkey sausage white-out. Amazing breakfast if you're looking for something on the healthy side - Breakfast nachos.... one word = HOLY CRAP. Okay, that's two but whatever. Amazing.",

One thing on the breakfast menu really stuck out to me - banana bread french toast.  I may not like eggs but I LOVE banana bread.  Add some caramelized bananas on top and some vanilla sauce and caramel sauce AND nuts?  Now that just sounds like heaven.  And it was.  There were 2 full slices (I ate one for breakfast and took the other home for lunch).  I opted for the side of fresh fruit (I can't remember what the other choices were) and this was good also.  Their ice water has cucumber slices in it - different and refreshing!  I would definitely go back.",

Although it is far more food than a single person can have on their own, it does serve great as leftovers.  Everything I have tried in search of my favorite has been excellent. The food alone, deserves 5 stars, but I hesitate to go that far because the service tends to be poor. It's little things like waiting far too long to have your order taken, letting the water get empty, socializing with the bartender instead of serving your customers, poor attitude etc.. These things add up, and as a result my husband won't go there anymore.",

We opted for the Daily Dose and I'm glad we did.  My friend got the Smore Pancakes, which she said were her favorite.  I got the Banana Bread French Toast.

    "text": "7:30 on Sunday morning is the time when the Daily Dose shifts from being a serviceable and pleasant upscale eatery to being a magical experience. The staff has had a few minutes to get into the groove; the tourists aren't up yet; the sun pours through the east-facing windows. It has the feel of a pub-like local hangout in a charming urban neighborhood.  This is a restaurant where it's a good idea to settle on a couple of dishes that you can't get elsewhere. The overall cooking is in line with the ambience and price range, and there are a lot of $12-$20/person bruncheries in this region. The major reason to show up is to wallow in what they do particularly well.  My personal vote starts with dishes that involve scrambled eggs. I don't like eggs all that much, but oh goodness, Daily Dose eggs... light and fluffy and NOT greasy and NOT chewy and really quite delectable to gently inhale. The originating chickens would preen with pride at these scrambled eggs. The rosemary steak is a breakfast steak, and it manages to actually be \"medium\" (not always a no-brainer with the thin steaks), and isn't loaded with fat, so I'm quite, quite content with having started there.  Avoid the biscuit. It is leaden and, peculiarly, grilled. I felt that the berry-laden blueberry jam was wasted on the biscuit.  Next time, I'd try the breakfast nachos on the strength of the scrambled eggs.",

However, DD was certainly very good and in most places, this would be my go-to spot for breakfast chow.  As others seems to have mentioned, the breakfast nachos are ridiculous.  The chips are tasty but more importantly they are solid, sturdy bits that are required because the eggs, chorizo and cheese on top would have broken weaker chip siblings.  A number of us took a bite of the chorizo and had that \"WTF!\" look on our faces because it was so good.  I ordered a turkey sausage omelet with fruit.  The toast wasn't great, but the omelet, home fries and fruit were pretty good (although the pineapple was a little out-of-the-can syrupy, if you are a Dole pineapple rings person!).  Prices were fair for the large portion size and the staff was fantastic, including a manager (or maybe the owner?) who spent some time sharing laughs at our table.  DD certainly draws a crowd in a tight window around the 10-11:30 AM block, when folks are looking for chow before heading out to day games.  But otherwise it seems like it's easy to slide in for brunch.",

Woke up and right away my friends go \"Find something good on Yelp\" well okay if you say so. Looking at a couple different options and scrolling through pictures Daily Dose caught my eyes. The pictures people were posting looked amazing and the reviews were on the positive side so i said lets go to Daily Dose!! Scratch that I drove I just told everyone to get into the car I didn't care what they had to say. Haha, arriving around 12:30pm there was a waiting time of 30 minutes but after when my friend pulled out this driver license to show it was his birthday she said she would let us in a little early if she found a spot for the 6 of us. Sat down outside with complimentary coffee for the wait which is very nice addition knowing they are always busy if they have that. She called our name out in about 10 minutes of waiting which was nice. We sat down and our waitress was very nice with us and I asked her a couple of questions and she said go with the Breakfast Nachos and oh I did..  I got the Salsa and the Pico on the side and also added Bacon... These were the best Nachos I have ever had in my life.. The cheese was melted perfectly the scrambled eggs and bacon on top was amazing and so was this dipping sauce they had it was like soup. The service was fast and amazing they messed up on the birthday boys nachos but fixed it right away with no issue and apologized for it. The seating is nice and they also have TV's. This place was the cure for me that Sunday morning. First breakfast place I've actually enjoyed, can't wait to come back!!",

    "text": "I finally got to give Daily Dose a try after a long night out in Old Town and it turned out to be just what the doctor ordered. We had a 30 minute wait for breakfast around 11am and it was well worth it. The free coffee they offer outside makes the wait a little more tolerable. When we finally got seated by the friendly host we enjoyed a nice outdoor patio hightop with a heat lamp keeping us warm. Everything on the breakfast/lunch menu sounded appetizing, but ultimately I went with the breakfast nachos. It was a pile of nachos with cheese, chorizo, scrambled eggs, and a side of sausage gravy. Not the healthiest of breakfasts, but a perfect hangover cure that tasted amazing. My girlfriend decided she was more in the lunch mood, so she opted for the Old Town Stack, which consists of shaved prime rib, swiss, horseradish mayonnaise & sweet onion slaw on a toasted pretzel sub roll. Also fantastic and I'd probably get it if I was here for lunch. She also went with the half regular and half sweet potato fries which got a thumbs up from us both. Check out the pics I posted to see what I'm talkin' about!  Overall, Daily Dose was a great food experience, except for the unbelievably obnoxious table of eight sitting nearby who laughed incredibly loud nonstop throughout the entire meal. Seriously, I've never seen or heard any table like it in my entire life. Such \"rude and thoughtless little pigs.\" Everyone on that patio was annoyed with them. Not the restaurant's fault though I suppose.",

My husband had a basic breakfast (eggs, bacon, potatoes, & pancakes) except that he opted for the gingerbread pancakes, which he said were awesome. I had the veggie omelet w/ egg whites. Man, was it a large meal! A medium sized, fluffy omelet w/ swiss cheese, asparagus, peppers, mushrooms, and onions w/ potatoes, a good sized bowl of fruit, and an english muffin on the side. And it was all delicious. It even came w/ an herb creme fraise, which I wasnt exactly a fan of, but I like the sweeter versions.

I called ahead and was delighted to hear they accepted reservations.  We were sat immediately upon arrival and greeted by our server shortly after.  If you've never been to DD, their Happy hour is awesome and runs until 8PM.   The HH menu has a little bit of everything including starters, entrees, salads, drinks, and burgers.   I started off with the mushroom and brie fondue and a hibiscus margarita. Both were excellent; I just wish they served it with more dipping items. It came with a few small slices of pretzel and a couple veggies, so I ended up with a bunch of fondue and a spoon!  Other starters ordered included a shrimp \"cocktail\", pretzels and crab cakes.  Those who ate them seemed very pleased as they disappeared quickly.   For dinner I went with the Veggie burger.  It was homemade and very tasty.  Unfortunately I had gorged myself in fondue so was unable to eat hardly any of it.   A few other burgers were ordered at the table, some tacos, a huge salad (Which was on HH too) and a couple orders of sliders. The sliders looked awesome; they were much bigger than any other slider I have ever seen.  My initial reaction was to upgrade my review to a 3, but after further consideration I've decided 4 stars is more appropriate considering the quality and price of the food.",

A bit pricy for breakfast, but the food quality is fantastic.  The one negative that we've encountered is the service.  Sometimes it's fabulous, other times horrendous.  We've found that if you sit on the patio on a busy morning the service is generally hit or miss.  We always seem to get the table of the waitress who doesn't seem to realize that our table is occupied.  On the flip side, we have had some great service.  A tasty treat in the morning & I recommend checking it out.",

    "text": "The first time was so good, we had to come back!  The Peach Creme Brulee pancakes wowed my partner both times... something totally addicting about the crunchy edges.  Their Daily Dose Hash is a delicious blend of sweet potatoes and onions, with so much more, making me wish I had the recipe.  The omelets are good, it's just that I want them to be better, to the point where I have to have them again.  Both the Caprese omelet and the Bacon omelet tasted like the listed ingredients were put into the omelet.  That is different from making the combination of ingredients to a whole delicious oneness.   I'm going to go for the French Toast next time.  The service the first time was a 10+ out of 10, with the 7am server being very friendly, very helpful and made the whole experience even better.  This past Weds morning, it was good, nice, perfect service and friendly... about a 9.  I really like this place and I'm going to go back a few more times to find the best dish.",

Of the five times I've been here, I've eaten breakfast four times and lunch once.  The first time we came with at least 8 people.  This was a bit of a problem, because they only have one area where they can seat a group of more than 4.  We didn't mind waiting though.  Second time, same scenario, but we were treated to an order of the breakfast nachos for having to wait so long.  Thumbs up for the management.  Third time with a group, no nachos and still a good wait.  Overall I'd say be prepared to wait if you are dining with a crowd, but it's worth it.   I consider myself a breakfast connoisseur, and I can honestly say this is one of my favorite places in the central phoenix/scottsdale area.  I've had the following:  Blueberry Ginger French Toast (wonderful, loved it) PB & J Waffle (x3, my favorite item on the menu) Grilled Cheese (great for lunch, fries are also tasty)  Side of bacon (phenomenal) Side of sausage (just the way I like it) Side of sourdough toast (crispy, but not burned)  I still haven't tried the pancakes, but I think that's next on the list.  They have a beautiful patio, so when the weather cools down again, I'll be sure to dine al fresco.",

Be warned, the portions were pretty large and we both could have walked out with to go orders had we not been staying at a hotel. She got the crabby, which I think was a great deal since, it had two crab cakes atop an already sizable omelette. It wasn't surprisingly good. It was exactly what you would expect or hope for. No more and no less, which is more than i can say for most breakfast places. I would definitely get it again. I got the meat and cheese omelette. I'm a sucker for smoked gouda so this was everything i hoped for and more. My only criticism is of what this places refers to as the DD hash. It's skillet cooked mixture of butternut squash and sweet potatoes with some caramelized onions. It sounds great, but was surprisingly lacking in flavor. I attribute this to poor seasoning and a maybe a lack fo salt, but it won't stop me from coming back the next time I am in town. All in all this is a great little place with good atmosphere and a fun menu. It's definitely worth a try.",

I've been there three times in the past 5 months and no matter how many times I try to ignore and avoid the incompetent boob behind the bar (Jonathan), it never works out. He's young and a terrible server/bartender. The first time I went, my date and I never got drink refills OR our orders. The second time, the guy literally couldn't be bothered with replenishing my mimosa--he was too busy talking to friends. Today, I thought I had the problem solved. I sat at a table outside the bar. But when my drink order hadn't even been taken after sitting at the table for over 5 minutes, I asked someone for help. And who do you suppose was supposed to be helping me but hadn't bothered to make his way over? Of course the guy I had been trying to avoid! It was like something out of a bad movie. I should have known when I had to beg for a drink. If you can avoid Jonathan, the salad is totally worth it.",

    "text": "When Cafe Carumba closed last year I started going to Daily Dose. They have good food, a nice (but small) patio, and a good location. I normally come here for breakfast during the week because it's less busy and crammed. They have a very small patio so on the weekends it feels like there is no breathing room and you're forced to listen to five other conversations going on around you at other tables. The service also gets really slow on the weekends. I was there one Saturday and I actually got my food before my mimosa. And that's not because the food was quick, actually I remember the food taking a long time too. I had to order my second mimosa when the server dropped off the first one just to make sure it came before our meal was over. Pity too because I absolutely love mimosas and would normally drink more than just two with breakfast. So far everything i've tried at Daily Dose has been pretty tasty. They've got a great pancake selection, and you have the option to have them made from a honey wheat batter. As for lunch, I always get the same thing. It's a grilled chicken sandwich on a deliciously soft pretzel bun. It's the pretzel bun that keeps me coming back. Normally, I would branch out a little and try other lunch entrees. As for the service at Daily Dose, it's always the same. The servers always seem annoyed. I actually went there this morning with a few girl friends and we ordered hot chai teas that came room temperature. We told the server they weren't hot and asked her to please warm them up for us, we even told her she could nuke them in the microwave and she told us they didn't have a microwave and then asked us if we had tried them yet. Of course we tried them, that's how we know they are not hot. I don't think i've ever really had good service there. Of course, despite all that I still go to Daily Dose on a regular basis. They've got good food, free wi-fi, and a good location.",

If you're looking for a traditional breakfast of eggs, pancakes, and goodness, this is your place. This is not what I opt for though... the Daily Dose is known for their phenomenal Peanut Butter and Jelly Belgian Waffle and the Bananas Foster Creme Brulee French Toast. There is nothing I don't like about PB & J on my waffles in the morning. To start off breakfast, the Daily Dose has one of the best cups of coffee in Scottsdale. I have grown to like the mocha's but the special blend of coffee they have ALWAYS seems to get remarks of greatness. When you go, you have to sit on the patio for breakfast. If you have a dog, bring fido along for some good people watching outside. Situated on Scottsdale Road and 1st Street in downtown, there is always something to see. One thing yet to try on the menu is the Hangover Sandwich... take a look at it when you are there. It is all things that are good, piled on a breakfast sandwich. Not sure I could finish it, but if you do, let me know!",

Carin had not been here before, nor had Lynn, so there we were:)  We were met at the door by the owner, Jenn-Lyn (also of Fusion, although she informed me that they closed Fusion a few weeks ago...sadly:(...but, on a positive note, the closing of Fusion seems to have allowed them to focus on DD, because, the everything is much better than the last time I was there, and they were quite busy:)  Drinks and menus' arrived right away, the service was friendly and accommodating and Carin and her mom were just delighted with the menu selections, the service and the ambiance of the place, and I agree...it's a pleasant spot:)  I decided to try something other than a burger today and am I glad that I did:)  I had a sandwich called the \"Old Town Stack...shaved prime rib, gruyere cheese and red cabbage slaw on the sandwich...inventive and very tasty!  Carin and Lynn had the Chopped Southwestern Salad and the Spinach Citrus Salad, respectively...they pronounced the salads delicious and the salads were also huge (we ended up taking  1/2 of each home).

    "text": "Can we all agree that the absolute most annoying thing is bad service?!? I had the strangest experience at Daily Dose. I read the review in the Arizona Republic about the amazing omelette's, pancakes, and overall atmosphere so I was dieing to try it!   The atmosphere is very lounge-like and completely different than most Breakfast hot spots. The owner was very friendly and sat us right away- the table happen to be next to her baby asleep on the booth bench next to me. You know when you are sitting so close to two other tables that it's hard to even hold conversation??   We ordered- I asked for the Prime Rib Omelet and my boyfriend got the Caprese Omelet. Our server (there were only two for the entire restaurant) messed up the order but nonetheless, I felt the food was lacking overall flavor- basic things like Salt and Pepper! Don't be fooled- the food looks amazing! But back to the \"experience....\"   As the owner brings us our food, she was sure to point out \"tell all of your friends that this is a great place to drink!\" And brought us a drink menu filled with Happy Hour specials and things like \"Join us for NFL Sundays.\" So the loungy  atmosphere, with NFL Sundays and Drink Specials, leads me to ask... what exactly is this place?!? In Old Town Scottsdale, with so many Breakfast restaurants, or bars, or sports bars, you need to stand out- pick what type of place you're going to be, and go with it!   They most annoying part of our Breakfast was that good friends of the owner and server were seated at the table next to us- while the two payed more than enough attention to that tables needs for drinks/paying the check, I sat there for a good 15 minutes with out Coffee or Water and a messed up order! It doesn't end there, another couple walks in the front door, and the owner is in the middle of bottle feeding her baby, so baby in tow, she seats the couple.... does anyone else think that's weird?!?   Ironically enough, as we're sitting there, empty cups, check ready to be paid, Channel 3 TV comes in to film the great place- I couldn't help but tell my boyfriend how unsatisfying the experience was as the camera man panned across our table.",

Eggs benedict was much better here than the Breakfast Club (according to my Husband) I had something a little healthier with fruit.  Portion sizes were generous.  We really enjoyed it here.  Well done!",

A very California menu, with cucumbers in the water and fresh avocados on their tacos, this is a fantastic place to get very good food at very reasonable prices.    The service is always friendly, and their Happy Hour menu is one of the best bargains in town.   The Kobe burgers are a bargain anytime, but $3 off a $10 1/2lb Kobe burger in Old Town Scottsdale during happy hour is unheard of.",

It was a busy, rainy Sunday morning, and after being turned away at several of our go-to's, the wife and I and a friend of ours settled on the Daily Dose. We were told our wait would be 35-40 minutes, and decided to stick since we had already been to 3 places and were getting close to starving. The wait ended up being about 10 minutes (BONUS) and we were seated.   The menu is HUGE. They have everything you can imagine and a few things you couldn't imagine. The portions were massive, and while the food was good, I wasn't that impressed with anything. Just sort of a great glob of food and...have at it! But it filled my hangover nicely anyhow.   Our server was great, and convinced me to return for a burger at their happy hour. I mean, any happy hour that goes til 8 is fine by me.   I will go back to the Dose again but probably because it's around the corner and they have a late happy hour.",

    "text": "This has always been my \"go to\" place for breakfast when I visit Scottsdale.  The location and the food are pretty good.  However, this morning I had a negative experience with pricing.  Hidden charges at restaurants are a pet peeve of mine.  Prices should be clearly written on the menu or explained before an order is placed.  I ordered a \"straight shooter\" breakfast that including \"your choice of meat\" for $9.  The waitress recommended the ham and I agreed.  I was surprised to see that the charge for my breakfast was $11.  I asked her why.  She didn't know why, so she asked someone else.  He told her it is because ham is $2 extra.  Apparently ham is not a \"meat.\"  This is a rather unfortunate and dishonest way of doing business that happens all too frequently in restaurants.  I will not do business with places that are dishonest in their pricing because I often wonder what other dishonest practices they might have in order to increase profit.  I am in search of a new place to frequent when I am in Old Town Scottsdale.",

    "text": "Even though  the Daily Dose (aka the Double D), just opened, I've been there twice already. This is a new breakfast-and-more place from Matt and JenLynn Long. I'm a big fan of their other restaurant - Fusion - and of breakfast, so of course I was very excited when the doors finally opened in late October.  They have created a beautiful space right in the heart of the Downtown Scottsdale action. The patio looks out on the main drag and on my first visit we could have sat out there watching all the amazing women walking in the breast cancer 3-day walk.  Instead we ate inside which was quietly removed from the on-the-street action. The table tops of polished stones were like sitting next to a beach in Florida, and the games were on the bar TVs so my friend was happy.  Breakfast was excellent. I had an omlette made with three eggs - just the right size for me. I hate wasting those five egg monsters at other places. It came with a choice of \"potatoes.\" I chose a hash made with squash and mushrooms.  It was similar to eating sweet potatoes. Breakfast also came with fresh fruit.   My friend appropriately had the Hangover Sandwich with turkey sausage, bacon, and jalapenos. He wasn't head-over-heels about it,  but hey - he was hungover. All entrees seem to be in the $7.95-$9.95 price range with the seafood add ins like crab costing a little more.  On my second visit I stopped in mid-day for a snack and to check my email. Yes, this place has Wi-Fi!  Unfortunately, they don't really have a \"snack\" menu yet. I opted for Chips, Salsa & Guac ($4.95). it was a warm green salsa to die for, fresh guacamole, and a mound of chips. I wish I had other people to share with.  Daily Dose just got their liquor license and is opening for dinner as well. I suspect they will add happy hour and happy hour style apps very soon. When that happens, look for me and my computer in the corner.",

It should be standard for any location within Old Town Scottsdale to have amazing atmosphere, service, and food and the thing about Daily Dose is they struck out on food which after all is said and done, is the end all of a restaurant.  Because if a place has bad service but great food, you can justify getting a great breakfast and ignore the server giving it to you.  The patio is cute and the server was nice, but my omelet was only so so and my \"side of fruit\" was actually less in amount than one of those fruit cups moms throw inside their kids lunchboxes...  I'll use my 2nd paragraph to briefly vent on how annoying it is to be sitting at a table with your friend and the servers are doing their sidework while you're trying to vent to said friend!

Let me break this down by each meal because just mentioning them isn't enough.   Chorizo eggs benedict - the chorizo is from a local butcher and probably the best chorizo I've tasted aside from homemade by family and the hollandaise sauce is light and perfectly made, not strong tasting at all.  This meal is paired with the best breakfast potatoes seasoned to perfection. The Belgium waffles and full, fluffy and sweet.  Almost like eating a cake like donut.  Mmmm mmmm! Hangover sandwich is basically like putting the all American breakfast between two pieces of toast.  BAM! Basically a groovy place with rad food.  Be warned you may have a wait and if you have a pup you can sit on the patio with your doggy.  Our pals bring their dogs pretty frequently. Check it out!",

Spicy, is a good word to describe it. But not overbearingly so. I feel like it was too much food on the plate. Last time my chorizo mac n cheese was a side dish side that was made with a different spiral pasta. This time it was big clamshell mac and it just wasn't as good.  Don't even bother with the cornmeal battered onion rings. I'm an onion ring aficionado,  and I can tell you this was a real loser. You want your onion ring skin to be crispy, and not corn-mealy and dry and which peels right off.   Anyway this visit was a bust, but I still like this place and I will be coming back with a different strategy in mind",

They were just what the doctor ordered to start our meal.  Breakfast was the Southwest Flannel Hash, which is a quality corned beef hash with the added bonus of jalapeno, tomatillo and red onion. The combination of flavors just works. Absolutely yummy!  The service was prompt, attentive and on point. As I can't think of anything on the negative side, five stars it is!",

Server was nice (Sorry I don't remember the name) had a little accent.....  His recommendations were good, but our food took 40 minutes. The sever realized it 20 minutes out - the manager ran our food and apologized, but no one checked to see how our food was - it was cold and the poached eggs over cooked with zero yolk.  We got our bill - paid it and left it at that.... $50 for a breakfast that wasn't good and took 40 min - #nottheserversfault",

    "text": "I came here to meet a friend for brunch.   Customer service was great our waitress was really kind and helpful. I noticed maybe the manager or owner I'm not so sure was on the floor walking around and interacting with the customers. He came by and asked if everything was good. I truly like when either the owner/manager is interacting with its customers.   I ordered smoked salmon eggs Benedict which came with potatoes. However, one pile of potatoes was different from the other?  I really liked the house potatoes but the other potatoes I want to say maybe it was their hash potatoes were by far my least favorite part of the dish. They were too sweet and soggy for my taste. The eggs Benedict were delicious! I would definitely come back for that alone.   I also ordered a Moscow mule which was pretty delicious. But I kind of didn't appreciate how they ask to keep your id as leverage so you won't \"steal\" their Moscow mule cup?  That was kind of odd, I totally understand they probably get high theft or something but you can choose a different alternative such as buying cheaper cups if it's really hurting your business that much. Rather than making their customers feel untrustworthy. That was probably the only downside of this place.    In other news, My friend ordered a Bloody Mary and I took a sip and it was so yummy next I will order that instead.   This place can be easily missed if you aren't familiar with the area so keep those eyes open!   Their menu was simple and easy to read. Huge plus!",

The Daily Dose was excellent at balancing a great meal with a strict timeframe, and for that reason I'll definitely return or recommend them as a solid breakfast option for those in the area.  If you're a fan of hash, look no further down the menu than the flannel hash benedict. It's a well balanced combo of marble rye, shredded corned beef, jalapenos, two poached eggs and red sauce hollandaise. Many places will overcook the brisket but it was done perfectly here. I found the jalapenos to give it a nice kick while the hollandaise added a bit of an unexpected but satisfying sweetness.   Our server was super sweet and attentive, especially when we informed her of our timing issues. She gave us regular updates, delivered the food fast and slipped the bill down at just the right time.",

There was a long wait - we were quoted 25 minutes but it ended up taking closer to 40. But we did get a table outside.  It's road-side, but there is a nice area to wait and they offer free coffee and water. It's not a busy walking street so there are a few chairs and plenty of space to stand. Fortunately the weather was good.  We were finally seated on the patio, which fit a lot of people in a small space. Clean, and a nice atmosphere. It wasn't loud or overcrowded despite the limited space.  The service was, unfortunately, very spotty. The server mentioned it was her third day on the job - I don't know if it was her first time waitressing but after the long wait we didn't have much patience. She brought a coffee with no cream or sweeteners, then came by with some 2% I'd requested for my tea, but no tea. Then she disappeared for a long time. Eventually the host came to apologize again for the initial wait and we told him what we were still waiting for. He came back with the tea, a fresh coffee, and cream. The server didn't seem to notice that she hadn't been the one to bring them.   Anyway, I had a god good crab cake eggs Benedict with potatoes and fruit. The eggs were perfectly poached and the hollandaise was good, not too rich. My dining companions seemed happy enough with their meals too, though by that point we probably would've eaten just about anything.  Seems like a decent restaurant but we had a frustrating experience.",

    "text": "So we really wanted to like this place but unfortunately it just didn't make the cut. We came on a Monday morning and the first issue was our food took 39 minutes and when it finally came out it just wasn't good. The chicken and waffles was subpar. The chicken was underseasoned and overcooked so the taste was bland and not good. The waffle itself was okay but the overall dish wasn't good. The lox and bagel came to us unassembled which for $15 should come put together in my opinion. Should have saved the money and gone to Einstein on this one as they will deliver it assembled. The second issue is when we asked the server about the overall timing of everything she responded \"we have a lot of big parties\", does that mean everyone else gets subpar service and bad food? Obviously, we didn't say that to the server as it's not her fault. Just kind of went hand in hand with the overall experience we had today. The atmosphere is appealing overall and they do have a full bar and a decent drink menu which made us give them 2 stars. Would we go back? Probably not.",

    "text": "I finally got a chance to go back here after almost a couple of years. I just am never at this part of the valley much and the times I have been here, it is never in the morning. Well the first time, was fantastic, I loved the creativity,quality, service, and execution of their food. I wanted to give the place a five star, my second one only in this area so far by the way, but I never give a place 5 stars without at least going there twice. The place is a little expensive and I am pretty cheap but it was well worth it. I believed I had the french toast last time, but even though I don't remember the details, I remember it was some of the most original and quality food I have ever had.   This time I decided to go with  the hangover sandwich which was the first time I had something with Jalapenos here in Arizona that didn't just burn all my taste buds. I could feel it but also able to taste the sweetness of the onions and tangy cheese and saltiness of the bacon. Every where in the valley, they pride themselves of just bringing the heat on like a camp fire, but what really do you get from that except a one dimensional response. People think it is great just because it is ultra spicy beyond belief, but that is the lazy way of cooking which is to toss in some really hot peppers to essentially cover up bad food. The sandwich was great, just wish they had an option for a regular pork instead of turkey sausage which is kind of bland, but maybe they will but I just never asked.  Anyways I also had their DD hash, which is a vegetarian dish, and believe me when I say that is the farthest thing about my eating habits. I gulped it up because it was just so well balanced. The dish came with their potatoes which was okay, but I usually don't like larger chunks of potatoes but most people do so I don't hold that against the restaurant, just not my cup of tea. Their coffee is awesome and you know that they even not only gave me a cup to go, but also made it an ice coffee. For the money it was well worth it. I hope to get a chance to try more of their menu and hopefully sooner than 2 years next time .   A plus and usually I don't really care about this as much as others, but their service is top notch. Helpful but not  bothering you every 2 minutes to get you moving, they don't even bring you the check  until you ask for it, plus it helps to come early in the morning, I hate waiting but I am not an idiot who goes right in rush hour and bitch about it either. I really enjoy it and would recommend it to anyone.",

Several things make this an outstanding breakfast/lunch spot. First, they use fresh ingredients & make many of their own products. For example, when you ask for jam, they bring out house jam, not the usual packets. Second, the menu is interesting & varied. We thought we could probably eat there for a week & not repeat a meal. Third, portions are big and satisfying. If you walk out hungry, I would wonder about you - seriously! My son is a big eater & he couldn't finish his plate (granted he was noshing off my plate & sharing part of a pancake with his dad), but still...They have GF pancakes & what they call \"stuffed\" pancakes. The cinnamon roll pancake (not GF) was awesome according my guys. Omelets are 3-egg served w/ potatoes, fruit & toast. The variety is good. I loved the Chile Verde & peppered bacon omelets. Both were great, plus they note on menu which items are GF. My son had corn pancakes with chorizo which he loved. He also liked the Hangover Sandwich. Be warned: there will be a wait if you go during normal breakfast hours. It can go over an hour at times. They serve free coffee & water while you wait & have some chairs in front. Wait staff is friendly & helpful.",

I joined the infamous Lindsey F and Gabi M for lunch here at Daily Dose. When we walked in Gabi told me it was a 3 star restaurant. I wasn't sure why we were eating at a 3 star restaurant when surrounded by so many fabulous dining establishments, but any food would do.  We were able to grab a table immediately, the menu is pretty extensive and our waitress was friendly. But yep..3 stars. My rock shrimp tacos sure beat another bag of pop chips, but weren't anything special.  And the friendly waitress forgot about our hummus appetizer.  If I was in the area I wouldn't hesitate to grab a quick bite or drink here, but nothing here to hop on a plane back to Phoenix.",

I could eat breakfast, lunch & dinner there every day.....   Let's talk about what makes them so great... I know - you want details....  Well to start homemade warm giant pretzels is a go-to every time. Especially during happy hour.   Chicken nachos...... no brainer.... $5 during happy hour and know what's even better DD is extending their happy hour for the summer 4p - till CLOSE!   My go-to is Cobb Salad with a veggie patty on top - dressing on the side please.... The salad is huge! Filled with fresh lettuce, tomato, crispy bacon, egg, etc.. The veggie patty homemade - warm - breaks apart with every bite! Just delicious. If I was on death rode I would choose DD to fill me with my last meal. WHY? Because the fresh, homemade food will definitely bring a smile to your face even if your about to die!   Thank you DD for making life so good....",

After the initial greeting and ordering we didn't see her again until we received the check.  Too bad because we wanted an OJ and maybe another coffee and didn't get a chance to order.  The caprese omelet was good but not great.  The chorizo jalapeno and onion omelet was pretty decent.  Also, not great.  Both omelets were all egg with very little inside.  The Bloody Mary was average at best.  The Americano was also ok, average.  I can see why people like this place because it has a nice vibe.  Lunch may be better.  I would rather go around the corner to Orange Table as the food and coffee were better.  Overall, I've been to just about every good breakfast joint in the valley and this place is not anywhere close to the top 5.  Again, I would hope that the lunch and happy hour drinks are what keep people coming here but that's neither here nor there.  I would go back to try lunch but won't run back for breakfast.",

When most other bars in old town have doubled their drink prices an hour or two prior, Daily Dose's happy hour is still going strong, which is reason enough for me to love them.  Throw in the fact that their happy hour food menu extends waayyyy beyond your average \"bar food\" (try chorizo mac and cheese or the portobello mushroom and brie fondue) and their drink specials are pretty darn good, and we have ourselves a winner!  The only reason this place gets four stars out of five is because, due to the fact that they are EVER so popular, the wait to get into this little piece of heaven can be quite lengthy.  But I'm always glad I stuck it out!",

I had the bacon and tomato omelet, which was very good also. I enjoyed the butternut squash hash that was served with it.   My one complaint was that the bathrooms are back by the kitchen and  this kitchen is kind of opened and it seemed like there was a foul smell coming from the kitchen. Not sure, maybe it was the bathrooms, the bar is right in that vicinity also, so maybe it was the bar. Reminded me of my days spent in the bars of Chicago. There was always this damp, yucky smell that seemed to permeate some of the old local watering holes; and this scent was similar. I am just glad that I visited the restroom after eating my meal and not before.",

Even the service was good, which seems to be an improvement since the reviews began.

I mean, if I want to spend two hours or more having breakfast, I'll go to the Orange Table, if I want flavorless, overpriced options, I'll go to the Breakfast Club, if I want mediocrity and middle America, I'll go to US Egg, if I want still-drunk patrons from Axis-Radius, I'll go to Cafe Carumba, but I digress...  I'd love a good breakfast place, and I was hoping that Daily Dose would deliver.  I loved that they put cucumber slices in the water.  The service was attentive, at first.  I think the place was wildly understaffed, as it later took a turn for the worse.  The food took FOREVER to come, and my dish (some kind of egg sandwich) was waaay over-cooked and sort of disgusting as a result.  The table next to me had an omelet and the eggs looked burned as well.   The side options are confusing (they offer squash as a side in lieu of potatoes, but they call it \"hash\", like um, hash browns) and the coffee is weak.  Good ingredients, decent menu, but the kitchen needs to step it up and they should either consider more servers or staff the place with more competent people.  I'll probably be back because I have a bad habit of frequenting places I dislike.",

If it weren't for the amazing bartenders I don't think I would go back.  Earlier review: Thanks to Absolute Pet Care's Recommendation I had an amazing time at the Daily Dose.  The bartender was fun and friendly, the food is creative and reasonably priced.  I will definitely be back especially since happy hour is from 4-8pm, and they offer free wifi.",

The Hangover sandwich is a heart attack between two slices of bread, but it's so worth it.  The sausage is great, and the way the eggs drip into the sandwich...mmm....  Most of their breakfast dishes come with a side of fresh fruit, which we love because we can share it with the kids.  Oh, and the best part, in my opinion- the breakfast nachos...  I thought my sister and I were the only people in the world who ate nachos for breakfast, but no... the people at Daily Dose do it too, and they do it even better than I do!  Unfortunately we moved from Scottsdale, but we'll be making the trek from Tempe to fill our bellies here!  It's a new fave!  My only complaint is that it can be a bit slow at times...",

    "text": "Not quite a five-star rating, but I ate here Wednesday and the hostess/waitress was nice, the food was served promptly. I was there for happy hour, which I found to be quite a bargain - much appreciated these days. The chorizo mac and cheese was inventive and provided a nice creamy flavour with just a hint of of spice. My friend ordered a salad, which she seemed to enjoy. As appetizers were half price during happy hour I figured I ought try another appetizer, and got the meatballs marinara. That was decent as well, though the bread gets a little soggy in the marinara sauce. Dos XX beer was $3, so an affordable afternoon out. Would have appreciated some German beer though - am getting tired of the Mexican/American beer dichotomy at so many restaurants.   Happy hour even extends to 8pm. All-in-all, I was happy my friend recommended this place.",

I was one of two tables when I arrived close to 730AM.   Service:  My server was a young guy. He was over the top. He was certainly one of the most attentive servers I have ever encountered in all my years of eating out. The only problem with him: he called me \"BOSS\" 200 times during the meal. It was excessive. I remember calling someone \"BOSS\" once and his reply was, \"my name is not Boss. Boss is some guy that lives in NJ\". Regardless, the entire staff(from the hostess to the manager) has really good customer service skills.   Food: Superb. The Banana Bread French Toast I ordered was the big winner. Cooked to perfection with a side of homemade Pork Sausage Patties. The coffee company Daily Dose uses is great. The BOSS kept refilling my coffee about 100 times.   Next time I'm in Scottsdale I will for sure be stopping at Daily Dose!",

It was a Monday, so the place was fairly empty when we arrived. I ordered an orange juice and the biscuits and gravy, my friend ordered one of their flavored iced lattes and the basic breakfast.  Unfortunately, the orange juice had an odd flavor to it, which my friend verified, so I didn't drink it. I guess the best way to describe it is that it tasted old. She didn't care for her iced latte and didn't drink that either.  The food was ok, but the potatoes and fruit tasted like they had been in the refrigerator/freezer too long. If you are serving fresh food, this should never be the case. I never complain, but I made a point to say something to the waiter about the taste - neither my friend and I ate the potatoes or fruit. The waiter was dismissive at best, we clearly had not enjoyed anything and he said nothing, even after I pointed out the bad tasting potatoes.  I hope this was just an off day for them, but it wasn't a good experience and based on it, I would not return.",

My favorite is the grilled steak and eggs. A small piece of sirloin (good breakfast size) with two eggs and some yummy herbed potatoes. My favorite part about it is it comes with this creamy rosemary sauce which is to die for. I dip my potatoes in it too so I can savor every last drop. My second favorite is the eggs Benedict served with a crab cake in the tower!! They really nail it with the eggs benedict. I would feel confident ordering any benedict on the menu. They make a mean virgin Bloody Mary. The wait on a Sunday at busy time was 30 minutes. Not too bad and their staff is so nice. The only thing I could even comment on was their eggs. I ordered my eggs over medium and they were still very runny and with a little gooey white which is a no-go for me. But I am picky when it comes to that. Definitely a must-go spot.",

The sandwich also came with a fruit cup and some potatoes all of which were quite good and went well with the flavor of the sandwich.

Staff was super sweet even though they were totally slammed. I just had a caprese omlette and a latte. Must RAVE about the latte which as a Seattlite and a coffee freak was a great roast.  MUST RAVE #2 the DD Hash which is this amazing butternut squash and porcini mushroom concoction... super flavorful. Sigh... just loved the environment casual, cozy, fun, the game was on.

A fast moving blonde noticed me looking for a bar seat and said she'd let the hostess know and that I'd be first in line...and I was, 2 minutes later, prime spot on the end. Later, the same woman hurried by and said \"Hey, nice seat!\" oozing a genuine touch. Turns out she was the co-owner. What a rarity for a popular, upscale locale with 500+/day (prob near 1000 some days?) coming through to have an owner working so hard in the trenches and interacting with a non-regular.  I'm so impressed with the bar staff that I had to write an extended review. The two bartenders, Sylvia and Laura, were fantastic. Sylvia made me a mimosa with a generous pour immediately upon ordering, adding my order in with two others she had going, which is just instantly efficient--I had my drink in 30 seconds flat, absurdly quick for a bustling bar. Both she and Laura have the skill that only comes with time behind the bar: to make small talk while slinging drinks for both the bar patrons and the waters' service tickets. Sylvia's worked at Daily Dose for 8 years (7 @bar), which says a lot, and Laura's bartended elsewhere and chose to come here. I commented that the $$ was prob too good to leave and she quickly said that of course it's good, but that the coworkers and ownership are the sticking point. They never let me want for anything, even though slammed and sans bar back.  Ok, ok, so anyway, the food. It's top notch, and I've been to all the Scottsdale brunch & breakfast eateries now. The ham benedict was perfect, hollandaise in just right amount and not too sharp. The lox & bagel was superb, the smoked salmon being slightly salty and not overly smoked. Lox connoisseurs might balk that the cream cheese was from a Philly packet, but that's a good brand, the overall price is competitive and many places re-scoop out of cream cheese tubs that are reopened often and exposed to the elements, so it didn't matter to me one bit (in fact it was tidier and took up less space, which I appreciated). The home-fried potatoes were well and simply seasoned, but if you're looking for the now-typical olive oil-laden red pepper, onion and potato mash these are more straightforward.  Overall the staff, atmosphere and food are inviting and excellent. It's clear this is a labor of love and that customers come first. With food a solid 9 out of 10, and the reasonable price for the location and food quality, this is an easy 5. Sylvia and Laura make a great duo at the busy bar: quick, fun, professional, and they know their drinks and customers. Just make sure to drink water with your mimosas...",

There was plenty of it!  Only complaint is that the potatoes as a side dish were pretty lackluster, even with all the hot sauce, and the coffee was a bit burnt.   I'd go back, but otherwise, there are better breakfast places nearby I would recommend before going here.",

    "text": "We were visiting Scottsdale for the weekend and came to eat here as it was close to our Airbnb. We came early enough with a small group of 3 so there really wasn't a wait.  I ordered the chorizo Benedict with their house hash and sweet potatoes as my other side. I liked the chorizo substitute over the classic ham. It was well seasoned with spices and held together like a patty. One of the eggs was perfectly poached with gold yolk. The other, not so much. Most of the other egg was over done with hardly any soft yolk. The chorizo, hollandaise and one yolk did pair together really well though.   Both sides were delicious. Crispy layer with the center of both being perfectly cooked. The hash was more savory and the sweetness from the sweet potato with the umami from the mushrooms helped to cut some of the heaviness from the dish.   Overall it was a solid breakfast, however I'd go with either the hash or the sweet potato vs  both.",

It was amazing! I loved the flavors on the benedict and it made me fall in love with that style of egg.  I'm glad my friend convinced me to get an item from the breakfast menu instead of the lunch menu as I had been planning on doing. Otherwise, I might have missed out on tasting this great dish!  The potatoes were cooked just right and came with a side of ketchup. I think the pulled chicken became dry after the next day and the pretzel bread wasn't as good as the first day. Therefore, make sure to eat it all the first day! There was also a cup of fresh fruit with my food. The pineapple and watermelon in it tasted bright and fresh!",

    "text": "Daily Dose was pretty friggin good.  I went here for brunch recently when I was on Vacation and was pretty satisfied with the experience. I mean yea, we had to wait 30-45 mins for a table but at least they had these cool chairs out front when waiting. They face the street so it's kinda nice just like relaxing and just enjoying the environment.   When we finally got our table, I was pretty hungry. I ordered a margarita and it was aight. Flavor was a little mild and it tasted like there wasn't a lot of booze in it. Here's to hoping the food isn't as lacking as the drink...I mean how would you feel? You end up having to wait a good amount for a table at a restaurant only to find out that the food is mediocre? Luckily Daily Dose didn't disappoint.  Me and my girl ordered the Roasted Top Sirloin Benedict and the Breakfast Nachos respectively. The Sirloin Benedict was amazing. Like imagine eating like a prime rib with the cross of a regular Eggs Benedict. The flavors of both dishes blend perfectly with the dish. I even decided to get a side of horseradish just to fully indulge. As for the Breakfast Nachos, I really enjoyed the sauces and the Chorizo Eggs. They charred them just a tad bit so it went well with the texture of the chips. Lots of flavor overall in the entire dish.  I would definitely go back here if I could. I would try a different drink and some other dish. I really am curious to see what other stuff on the menu is good. Speaking of the menu, their Breakfast menu is extremely balanced. There are loads of options for people to eat and most of all, at \"really\" good prices. I live in the Bay Area in California and a lot of the items on that menu would easily be a couple of dollars more if this was where I live. Service ultimately was solid as well. I highly recommend this place to anyone who lives in the area or anybody visiting who are looking for an amazing breakfast place with extensive options.",

I really wish we would've found this place on the first day of our trip to Arizona rather than the last, because we definitely would've hit this place more than once. From their coffees to their pancakes to their eggs to their bacon I really can't emphasize how fantastic this restaurant is. The owner Adam is fantastic, you can definitely tell that he takes pride in his restaurant and really takes the time to reach out to the customers. Our waitress was Sass and she was also phenomenal - made excellent recommendations which we went for and were extremely happy with.

It even had Chorizo, which wasn't that greasy. One piece of toast cut in half and our server asked if I wanted jelly, of course. My wife and daughter had the Avocado Toast. She thought the bacon would be chopped up, it wasn't which made it difficult to eat. But she loved it. Our server was right on point, checking to make sure our water and coffee mugs were filled. As we were leaving our server asked if we needed water or coffee to go.  Parking wasn't a problem at 9:15 am on a Sunday morning. There is also parking in the back of the restaurant.

The food tastes very generic and mediocre, and the poor waitress was wearing a jersey and pigtails for some kind of theme day while serving me pancakes at 10:30 a.m. on a Tuesday.   The food was quick to come out and very basic quality, as you can imagine. I got the Hangover Sandwich, which is an egg sandwich served on sourdough with bacon, sausage, cheese, jalapeno, sauce and onion. It's served with breakfast potatoes that were soggy and bland. The bread wasn't properly toasted, so it was that odd sub-toast where the bread isn't stiff and therefore all the toppings make it soggy and falling apart. Would not recommend this dish or the restaurant in general. No parking, either, except street nearby.",

It was a Saturday around 1pm and we got sat right away, there were only 4 of us. It was not packed in there but there were quite a few people.  I love their mimosa options as you can get a bottle of champagne for $19 and then one juice comes with it and you have a variety to choose from. We picked cranberry and peach. The peach with the champagne was really good- definitely recommend that.  The price of their food was reasonable like most places in old town would. I have to say hands down the best sausage gravy I've had in Arizona. If you come here for brunch make sure you get either the biscuits and gravy or even just a side of the sausage gravy works. I mixed it in with my scrambled eggs.  I only gave this a 4 star Instead of the full 5 because our servers were kind of lacking in their service. We felt rushed cause he came by almost every minute on the minute lol and most would say \"at least he was attentive\" but it kind of gets annoying when they check in all the time for no reason.  However, food was great so definitely a spot I would go to again.",

My four other breakfast companions absolutely loved their meals as well. They had a chorizo omelet, veggie omelet with fruit, breakfast burger with DD hash, and roasted vegetable grilled cheese sandwich. We sat outside on the covered patio with fans blowing to keep the AZ heat tolerable.   Our server, Sydney, though claiming to be new to the cafe, did an excellent job. She handled our five different orders and special requests like a champ. Would definitely come back.",

She was the only bright person in the entire place!   We ordered two drinks and the portobello and brie fondue plate.  Drinks were great.  The dish on the other hand was a bowl of what looked like soup, pieces of bread and badly cut pieces of tomatoes, cucumbers and carrots. None of the plate really looked good but we ate it. Very salty fondue. Not enough bread.   Wasn't impressed.  Oh and there were typos in the menu!",

When we pointed this out to the manager, she blamed it on the owners word choice and said she was working on it but didn't change our bill. The food was amazing as usual.  We had chicken nachos, a pepper bacon blt, a ruben, hummus and brie. A couple of other sandwiches as well. All were so good.

You know it is a popular brunch place, and of course in a good location as well. However, as the services were pretty slow for both times and the food did not 'wow' me at neither times, I just have to give an average ratings...   What I like on both tries? The orange juice! Yes, it was fresh and delicious! The Prime Rib omelette was pretty good as well, especially if you add a few drops of Tabasco for a spicy hint, it just tasted better! However, what I did not like, the Smoked Salmon Egg Benedict... The dish arrived kinda cold, feels like it was sitting on the counter longer that it should have, the english muffin was over-toasted which it became hard to cut,  the poached eggs were not done so well (i think they were too flat by the shape?), and there was too much of the Hollandaise sauce on the top and it just stole the taste of the smoked salmon... how I wish it was better.  If you are in the area and look for a place for breakfast/brunch, Daily Dose is still a good choice, just be prepared for a wait on the weekend and avoid the Egg Benedict?",

    "text": "I initially visited Daily Dose about a year ago after a night out.  I was only able to stomach some coffee and a few bites of breakfast nachos that morning, so I wanted to come back for a real (sober) meal.  Alas, they made a better impression on my first visit, headache and all.  My recent visit was on a Sunday, around 11:30am, and surprisingly there wasn't a line.  We had a 5 min wait though, so we helped ourselves to water & coffee from the pitchers outside.  When we were called to our table I was a little disappointed - the table was tiny and squeezed between the door to the front patio and a server's station - but I let it go.  My son knew he wanted a cheeseburger and I finally decided on the Ancho-chile corned beef sandwich with sweet potato fries.  Yes, this was going to be a cheat day!  Our waitress seemed.... off, and lacking personality.  She didn't take our menus after we'd ordered and there was no where to put them on the tiny table, so they ended up propped up against the window.  Same thing with our paper cups we'd brought in from outside - they sat next to the menus the whole meal.  The wait for our meals was a little long in my opinion - about 35 minutes.  During that time, our waitress was completely MIA and our drinks sat almost empty.  Thankfully, the guy who finally brought out our food was nice enough to refill them.    So, I thought corned beef rubbed with ancho chili spice and topped with sauerkraut on rye was going to be a bomb of savory, tangy, spicy flavor!  But.... not, not at all.  What in the hell do you do to sauerkraut to make it BLAND?  How do you make these yummy ingredients just completely flat??  Frankly, I was PISSED I wasted so many calories on this sandwich.  I ate half because I was really hungry but didn't even bother to take the other half home.  On a more positive note, the sweet potato fries were excellent.  Feeling unfulfilled, I decided to try my son's cheeseburger.  Even though it was from the kid's menu, the burger was ENORMOUS and they sure didn't skimp on his fries either.  Sadly, the burger was also really under-seasoned and I honestly wondered if they'd seasoned it at all.  The pretzel-bread bun was the most flavorful part of the burger - it was yum!  About 15 minutes after our food came out, the waitress finally came by.  I asked her for a box (for my son's burger) and the check, which she brought to us at the speed of light.  I was very surprised to see I'd been charged $2.50 for a glass and a half of lukewarm, weak iced tea.  If I'd known that, I would've ordered a Tecate light for the same price.  Anyway, I got the distinct impression she wanted us to leave so her table could be re-seated with people who would drink and rack up a bigger bill.  Her loss, as I usually tip very generously when I'm out with my son.   Overall, I was just totally bummed with Daily Dose's food, service, and value - and bummed my 100th Yelp review only deserves 2-stars.",

We had a party of about 10 of us, and even with going during the brunch/lunch rush we only had about a 20 minute wait (they don't take reservations.) Everything started off well- we were happy to see that their mimosas were only 5.50 for a single and that they were mostly champagne with a splash of OJ versus the other way around. The menus is absolutely huge, so there are options for everyone. Where things took a bit of a turn was the service. Our waitress seemed a bit all over the place, and she also seemed to be a bit on edge and snippy with us. Being a larger party, we tried to keep things simple,  but at the end of the day the server generally made us feel like an inconvenience. The food was pretty good (I ended up ordering lunch and got the turkey avocado sandwich with sweet potato fries, and most of the rest of the girls got brunch items they enjoyed), but my gosh our wait for a bill and then payment of the bill took forever. We were all extremely ready to leave when we finally were paid out, and given the fact that the rush was over at this point and we made the division of the bill super simple we really didn't understand why it took so long. Overall, I'd go back with a smaller party that would hopefully get a different server and some better service.",

(Warning:  they really like to use Rosemary in this place, and it is a very overpowering herb, so be careful)  Gf had veggie omelet that she liked, and the fresh squeezed orange juice was tasty and cold.  Would definitely come back.",

    "text": "Before all else THIS IS THE BEST HAMBURGER I HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE!!! I just wanted to put this message out before the rest of my review or wherever yelp cuts off before you have to click \"read more.\" If you read nothing else in this review, just know that this is the best ground beef to bread combination I have ever had in my existence.   Now I have never had a pretzel bun anywhere else, and I understand these things are growing in commoness even Wendy's has one, but regardless where else they make these things whoever came up with the idea of sandwiching meat with pretzel bread should win a medal or something. Especially at the daily dose the slices they use are basically entire bread loaves. The beef is Australian Kobe and tastes fantastic. No, it's not real kobe beef but its still filling without feeling greasy then add bacon, cheese, and of course that bread and you might as well put up a white flag and surrender to the thing.   Actually never got a drink here, but the chorizo mac and cheese is also recommended if you must try something else. The atmosphere also is great very classy but not snobby. Price is higher than a chain but portions are very large you do not feel short changed.   Oh and in case you missed it, try the burgers.",

    "text": "Tired of your standard breakfast fare? Daily dose is bit of breakfast with twist, with their menu containing some great healthy alternatives, along with some really interesting and tasty versions of French toast and omelets, among other things.  I am a bit of a Daily Dose regular. Aside from some of the higher end brunches provided at the resorts, Daily Dose offers one of the best breakfast and lunch menus in the Scottsdale area. I've had a good sampling of the different types of items off their menu - You really cannot go wrong with anything listed.   This past visit I tried the Crabby Omelet and the Mediterranean Salad with shrimp. The omelet came with two medium sized crab cakes and an omelet with spinach and tomatoes. The flavors worked quite well together, as the crab was much better suited as separate items than combined with the omelet, like I've had at other places. While the portion size of the omelet plate was generous, the salad was absolutely massive. It was definitely larger than what most people could finish themselves. As only a small complaint, the salad came under-dressed, so I had to request more dressing on the side. I only see this as a small issue because I would much rather a salad to come with less dressing than too much.  Of the other menu items, their burgers and breakfast burrito are also quite delicious. They have a pretty strong list of unique mixed drinks along with non-alcoholic concoctions, which seems to be a trend across the brunch spots in the area. I'm a bit more of a coffee and juice drinker in the morning, but to each their own!  Check this place out when you get the opportunity, as you'll be hard pressed to find a better economical brunch spot! Enjoy!  [This review is based on my visit on July 28, 2013]",

The food was terrific, and I enjoyed their Veggie Hash (squash, onion, mushrooms) as a side to my smoked turkey & brie omelette.

These are amazing waffles with piles of strawberries and a smooth cream sauce drizzled over it with a helping of whipped cream on top! Yum! It's so great that it doesn't even need syrup. The first time I went, it was a Saturday and it was about 11:00 AM. Although there were people lined up outside waiting for tables, they got people in very quickly. I believe, that we waited about 15-20 minutes for a table of 4. That was nothing considering they have a nice seating area outside of the restaurant.

Big crab cakes, delicious omelet, tasty sides... The serving was huge (at a very reasonable price) and I had leftovers that heated up really well in a skillet the next day. I also got a mimosa that was heavy on the champagne, light on the OJ -- perfect!  The next time I went with my mom and we split the ginger snap granola, which came with fresh and sweet strawberries, and the prime rib omelet. Once again, I was impressed.   Can't wait to come back and try the cherry margarita that I spotted on the menu. I've been dreaming about it every since.",

I loved the Turkey burger in the past, this time they changed the bun to some low quality bun when it used to be a pretzel bun. The onions were the worst I have ever had. They used like a cornmeal breading. I recommend this place to everyone I know, but it appears that things have changed. I was going to say it was just an off day, but the menu changes and other things lead me to believe it isn't. If I get brave, I may try the Midtown location to see if it hasn't changed but have a feeling it has. On top of it my stomach was upset for a day afterwards. I am willing to pay good prices for good food.",

I tend to base my opinion of a place in regards to happy hour on the choice of drinks. They had a very good selection of beers, and even had my seasonal favorite, Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter, on tap at the time of my visit. Not to mention, they had a lot of their own speciality drinks that seemed rather tasty. However, once I realized they had my beer on tap, I couldn't venture away.   All in all, great place to meet up with a group of friends!!",

If I found something like a hair or nail or a cockroach it'd be disgusting. But tiny spider.. well it's hot in Arizona, all these insects are everywhere, it's not great but what can you do) So I didn't even want to tell about that to a manager but kids did. And his reaction was interesting.. He didn't believe me. He asked me like ten times if I'm sure it was a spider, if I'm sure it was in my salad, if I'm sure I really saw it. Like really?!  In a situation like this a wise manager would just apologize and would take this item out of a check. But this manager said because I already ate big part of the salad he'd take only part of the price out of the check.  Like really?!  Whatever...

I did not make a big deal of this incident, so many readers might think \"well if you didn't say anything, you don't deserve anything. \"  Let me point you back to the first sentence of this review.  Good service is good service and shouldn't require me whining about anything.    The brunch itself was pretty tasty, though the kitchen might not know the definition of what an over-hard egg is supposed to be.

YAY  Well, I've had the Caprese Omelet the last two times I was there. Perfection. All there omelets come with an abundant amount of food and the omelet itself is huge. You get a side of toast, herb potatoes, and DD hash or fruit. The omelet is served with a side of rosemary creme fraiche which I was skeptical of until I dipped my fork into that little pot of gold... then I smothered my omelet in it YUMMY.   The DD Hash is seriously my new favorite food. It's butternut squash smothered in some secret blend of herbs and spices and oils that make me want to weep tears of joy. Seriously.  My boyfriend has tried the Protein pancakes which are jam packed with fruit and other goodness. I also tried the Peach Creme Brulee pancakes which sounded more exciting than they were, but they are nonetheless DELISH.    I have yet to try any lunch or dinner here but there salads sound especially enticing! Can't wait for next weekend cause you know where I'll be.",

    "text": "I really liked this place. Was recommended for breakfast/brunch.  Located right in the thick of Old Scottsdale- a perfect stop before or after souvenir shopping / gallery hopping. Parking abundant and free 3 hours on the streets. Such a treat coming from Cali!!  Definitely had a \"bar-ry\" vibe- its dark and atmospheric inside, but it was a cooler day (rare in Scottsdale!) so we opted for inside dining.  I am sure this place is hopping come nighttime.  Service was efficient and friendly.  Menu is enormous. Bloody Mary selection looked divine. I was DD so did not imbibe but I wanted to!  Portions were perfect- not gut-busting, which I appreciated, but not skimpy by any means. The prices were good for the area (approx 10.00/pp)  We tried:  Polenta Egg Benedict w green chilis. Does this sound fantastic or what? It was- spicier green chili forgot the name- poblano? Eggs were absolutely perfectly yolky and warm. The hollandaise was delicious. It was a teeny tiny bit spicier than perfect for me, but I enjoyed it. The potatoes on the side were great and perfectly cooked.  Eggs Benedict w Ham. Was divine. Once again, their sauce is great- just rich enough not too thick or thin, not oversalted as many are, and full of flavor. Did not leave us feeling like gluttonous slobs- no \"benedict hangover\".  Egg Whites w mushrooms and spinach wrap.There HAS to be a healthy person at the table to make the rest of us feel like a fat shlump! Lol! Dish was reported to be delicious (not a egg white fan, tbh) I can tell you this person is usually very picky, yet they cleaned their plate- a rarity!  We all had coffees (they have an extensive coffee drink menu) and the double espresso was a real eye opener, served traditionally with lemon zest- love it.  I'd be ever so grateful if you could click on useful, funny or cool if it applies. Happy Yelping!",

I personally had the granola, fruit with almond milk, it was light and tasty. My husband had the applewood ham eggs Benedict with a side of fruit and loved it. I would highly recommend this place, but I understand if people aren't interested in waiting in line. The food & large menu will not disappoint.

It came out near raw. He barely ate it. My moms eggs were a \"runny\" scrambled and she wouldn't eat them. And the gravy she ordered was beyond salty. I couldn't even eat that. My bacon was really fatty which I haven't had before there. My dad ordered coffee and specially said no cream as he very much does not like cream, she brought it anyway and I had to ask to have it removed from the table. Also, the option for regular water without cucumber on the table would be great too as we all asked for that. My family is too nice to send food back or say anything also afraid of the kitchen retaliation in their food. I don't know if it was because it was so busy or just a bad cook day but a busy place like that in old town should ALWAYS be on point.   PRO: We got seated right away and the pancakes were great!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I totally disagree with another reviewer who said this place looks like a pub/sports bar when you first walk in.  It doesn't, in my opinion.  You want the feeling like you are walking into a sports bar?  Go to Zipps down on Camelback and Miller.  THAT's a sports bar, and definitely not a pub.  So, me and my Complimentary Force, aka SO, aka, Mrs., went here for the first time this past Sunday.  We live within walking distance and always said we would try it, as we have with many of the other breakfast joints in Old Town.   Service - 5 stars.  The entire staff was friendly, smiling and seemed genuine.  Our server, Miguel, was super nice, informative and if he didn't know the answer to a question, like, \"hey, who makes your bread\", he would go find out.  Food - Okay, I would like to go higher, but this is based on my personal food preferences.  I'm giving the food 4 stars because as FRESH, WELL PREPARED and THOUGHTFUL everything was, the caramelized onions were too sweet for me.  I had the chorizo omelette and the presentation and flavor of the chorizo was great.  The potatoes were yummy and the marble rye bread was really tasty, made by a local Phoenix bakery that sells to restaurants only (thanks for the info, Miguel!)  The rosemary creme fraiche that was included was distinctively wonderful.  My included side was the flannel hash, which tasted like it used both russet and sweet potatoes.  Again, very good, just too sweet.  My lady love had the southwest flannel hash, and like the chorizo omelette, the caramelized onions were too sweet but everything else about it, meat, potatoes, etc... were very good.    Neither of us are huge into sweet-tasting food (we're sweet already!) so that's where the lack of 5 stars comes from.  Coffee - great!  Both the leaded and unleaded (that's caffeinated and decaf for anyone not savvy to the lingo).  I would definitely recommend Daily Dose to anyone and will also eat here again.  Bon appetit!",

You walk in and are greeted by the full bar with TVs, but that's the only spot if desiring to watch football during brunch that I'd encourage sitting at.

It tasted more like Italian beef meat rather than shaved strip steak. I put it off to the side and just ate my pancake. I was just going to go down the street to jimmy johns. However, she took it back and asked me to order something else from their menu, I was hesitant, but she insisted, so I did. I was very happy with her Customer  service. She was very patient with me and extremely helpful. I'm a very picky eater so I appreciated her kindness. I got the meat and cheese omelette and it was delicious! Their teas are also very good!

DD has a great urban feel to the decor and lots of happy hour specials.  I'm a fan of the Daily Dose burger as you don't have to add ketchup or mustard.  The nachos are monstrous and glad to see a place still serve fruit as a side.",

Got seated right away at bar. Service was prompt and server was attentive and knowledgeable. However I did have to ask fir the check. Quality of food was better than I expected. Got crab omelette....being from maryland im a crab cake snob but these were good. Could have used some old bay..whole grain toast was thick cut and fresh..appreciated butter and jam in metal ramikins and not packets. Jam was amazing...I also got to sit next to the most important man in the world who felt the need to interrupt the server EVERY time she came over to me. Server was patient and I believe this guy might be in need of mental help. But I digress..price was good for the value..I will be back and cant wait to try lunch..",

I usually enjoy a bloody mary with Sunday brunch, but I think my expectations were a little too high. My all time favorite is that of Orange Table. I went for the Bacon Bloody Mary and would not repeat. I would definitely return for the food.  I ordered the Flannel Hash which was YUMMY. Friends ordered oatmeal, pancakes, and the benedict. All were amazing! It was well worth the 20 minute wait for a table.",

I am NOT a sweet breakfast-orderer either, so if I  miss pancakes then it means they are truly amazing.  I can honestly say this is the only place I've been to that I would ever order a type of pancakes for breakfast.  They're so good that putting anything on them (syrup or butter) just takes away from the amazing-ness of them. Their omelets are always fantastic, too.  My favorite here is the delicious caprese omelet and I've also had the veggie omelet which is fabulous.  Their breakfast menu is sooo great I wish I could go back and order everything.  Also, they serve breakfast all day!  Awesome bloody mary's, too.   Love it!!!",

We had a giant party of 9 people so it took a while to get seated, but after that everything ran surprisingly well considering the size of the group.  The food came pretty fast and my diet coke was never empty.  Our waitress/servers were all excellent.  Because I read some Yelp reviews before my visit, I was pretty confident that the burger was a good choice.  I ordered \"The Gladiator\" and it was excellent.  The toppings, meat and bun were all top notch, fresh and tasty tasty and I would definitely order it again.  I only had a bite or 2 with the delicious pretzel bun so it made sense in my head to order the fries.  I ordered the combo fries which are half regular and half sweet potato.  I didn't really like them and would order another side in the future like the hash which sounds interesting.  Anyway, the fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and not overly greasy, but I think they lacked flavor.  After tasting their burger and studying their menu I can't wait to go back.  Their breakfast menu has TONS of things that look awesomely delicious and can't wait to try them.  I just wish this place was in a different/larger location because I could tell that the place gets jam packed in the morning and I bet the parking is a pain.",

The roast beef tasted cheap, and it tasted microwaved. You know the fatty, tendony, bland taste that cheap meat offers? This sandwich sat in my stomach like a grease ball. The regular french fries were tough--don't even know how it is possible for fries to be tough unless they were stale or old or something.   There was absolutely nothing memorable about this sandwich whatsoever. The menu is pretty unimaginative and the vegetarian options were pretty poor. Wow, ANOTHER restaurant that has a portabella mushroom sandwich for vegetarians? Pinch me.   The tomatoes on my sandwich were crunchy and still green, I am not even joking.   Finally, the pretzel bread which was supposed to be amazing tasted like every other enriched-white bread roll I have ever had. There was nothing memorable about it at all and I was frankly puzzled by the enthusiastic response to it.  Hint: The prices are affordable because they order the cheapest produce, and cheap nasty meat. I came to a restaurant for a sandwich because I wanted something more exciting than packaged deli meat from the grocery store could offer. I failed, and won't be coming back here ever again.",

The side salad, in complete disregard to it's name, arrived 10 minutes before the food.  Fair enough, I'm still getting used to American dining practices but it made for an awkward moment with the person I was eating with as they had no side dish to arrive early and stare at...Anyway, when the food arrived I genuinely couldn't taste the difference between the salmon and the vegetables, so bland was the flavor of each.  A restaurant that can't make fish and carrot taste different from each other simply can't be good, right?",

My family and I went here this evening because we had been to the one in Phoenix and were pleased but I cannot stress enough the terrible experience we had.  The waitress forgot to put in an order and we were almost done before the meal came.  She never once came to explain or apologize and an apology would have gone a loooong way.  She basically ignored us from then on - put on your big girl panties and deal with it.  We asked for the manager who was either ignorant or arrogant but regardless his lack of managerial skills, social skills and communication skills simply made the entire situation worse. We explained we were there for a celebration and were told we would be given a dessert.  A different waiter attempted to put the dessert down on our dirty table because no one could be bothered to clear it...really????  So WE cleared our table , so that he could put it down and did we then get utensils to eat the dessert?  Nope.  The original waitress finally reappeared to see if everything was ok - seriously?  Were you on vacation the past hour?  And then on our bill we were charged for the long awaited meal and the dessert we were told was to be on the house.  Again, the manager with the seriously deficient intelligence ignored us - did he go to the same school of stupidity the wait staff attended?  And then he kept us waiting even longer for the new bill, which was a complete joke.  The food was average but I'm guessing the reason it was so completely dead in there on a Sat. night in Scottsdale is because the manager and staff are inept, rude and pathetically incompetent.  Oh, but thanks to the really brilliant waitress who gave the scotch to the 17 year old!  And the IQ points just kept continue to drop....",

Had been there once before and everything was fine, the food and service was excellent. So, when we arrived we sat outside as my guests wanted to enjoy the weather. We sat for 10 minutes before receiving any attention. My guests were very thirsty, as they had been on a plane for 4 hours. When the waitress finally came, we asked for water, and I ordered a coffee, they ordered drinks. Well, I got the coffee, but nothing else happened for another 5 minutes. When we reminded the waitress she got very snippy and  said that she would find someone else to serve us as she was only one person (she only had our table and another table of 2 to attend to on the patio). Needless to say, she never returned and neither did any other wait staff. After another ten minutes, we decided to leave. I talked with Kiley, the manager, and she apologized. Food is great, service is not. Good luck if you go there - if you want water, bring your own.",

My nachos was one of the best breakfasts that I've ever had.  They have egg, chorizo, jalapeno, onion, tomato, oaxaca cheese, and a special cheese sauce.  The cheese sauce was a combination between sausage gravy and nacho cheese and it was easily the best part of the meal.  Just writing this review I wish I had time tomorrow to stop in again.    My wife's prime rib benedict was a standard eggs benedict, but with prime rib instead of ham.  It was also very good, but I was only allowed one bite so I don't have a full review on it.    Between the staff and the food I would highly recommend this place, and I will definitely be dining there again.",

I've had breakfast and lunch and enjoyed both, though I'm partial to breakfast.  My favorite thing so far is the Hangover.  Turkey sausage, bacon, egg, carmelized onions and jalapenos and harissa aioli on sourdough bread (i like it better as a wrap).  Its the perfect combination of sweet and spicy.  Great if you are hungover or not.  The salads are delicious and the portions are huge!   My friend loved the burger.   I can't wait to try their tacos.  Thats next.....",

I really wasn't sure what to expect being in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale...you never know what you're going to get over there. The other customers were pretty typical: a variety of tourists and douchey young people recovering from their drunken night on the town. But the service and food were really quite impressive.   Their 7am to 4pm breakfast is pretty sweet and there were obviously many people there for that reason alone. The breakfast items I saw come out of the kitchen looked really tempting and I'm sure we'll be back to try some of them soon. We chose, however, to go with lunch that afternoon and were not disappointed. We started off with the Chips, Salsa, and Guacamole which was really good. We tend to be pretty picky about our guac and theirs was surprisingly delicious. For our main meals my husband ordered the Vegetable Salad Nicoise and I ordered the Caprese Grilled Cheese. Both were damn good and definitely worth ordering a second time.   I'm definitely looking forward to trying out the Daily Dose again. Their menu is huge and has seriously good looking options for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner. The atmosphere was decent too. The inside was pretty dark for a breakfast spot, but the patio was lovely.   Keep up the good work, Daily Dose, we'll be back soon!",

When we were seated , it took 10 minutes for a server to greet us, 20 minutes for our drink, and 30 minutes for our food to come.  I ordered the pulled chicken tacos which were so bland and uninspired. The chicken tasted like it was sitting out in the Arizona sun for days, it was so dry I couldn't even swallow it. I politely set my plate aside , and didn't make a scene.  The server comes back and notices I didn't like it , I said I didn't care for them and she walks away. Whoever is running this place doesn't know the first thing about running a restaurant.  Understaffed , lack of service , and overwhelmed with flustered servers, mediocre drinks , and overpriced garbage.  I would rather eat my breakfast at a grease spoon diner.",

Then the food came out (guy ran it from kitchen) our server walked past us multiple times. My husband finally went to the bar and asked for water refills, more napkins, and hot sauce. With all the breakfast places in old town, slim chance we will ever go back here simply bc of lackluster service!",

    "text": "The name of this restaurant MAY conjure up memories of big unfriendly pills being shoved down your throat after a bout of flu... but I hope that it will now take on new meaning considering the non-flu-like scrumptiousness that takes place here!   I stumbled upon reviews while looking up different breakfast joints in the Old Town area and I was impressed with the many menu options, so I took my friend here on a Saturday morning. We only sat waiting for about fifteen minutes, which was impressive. It's a big place and they have many seats.  So back to those MANY breakfast options: Hello Waffles! Hello Omelets! Hello HEALTH NUT OPTIONS? I am that person who stares at the healthier options at a breakfast joint, telling myself that it'll be good-- or at least not filled with regret and coma-inducing ingredients. Unfortunately, delicious breakfast food is typically sprinkled with these for the utmost flavor and enjoyment. So, with my egg white selected, when the server comes around, I blurt out \"Eggs benedict!\" every time...ultimately failing. (But never disappointing myself!) This time, I decided to take a leap of faith because of the following:   Roasted Turkey Sandwich House roasted turkey, corn salsa & red onion scrambled with three egg whites. Topped with chili cheese sauce & avocado served open faced on multigrain. Served with herb potato & fruit.  OK... I admit this has both cheese sauce and potatoes in it, so it's not EXACTLY an egg white omelet with spinach and mozzarella. Alas, it had tons of flavor and came in such a heap that I had to take half of it home! The chili cheese sauce and corn salsa really made the dish. My friend got the Belgian waffle with the DD hash and a side of their thick-cut bacon.  What is the DD hash? you might ask. WELL, it is butternut squash sauteed in miracles and tears of joy. There are some onions and spices in there too. I will be getting an item that comes with the hash option next time FO SHO. Mmmm.  So the Daily Dose, overall, made me feel like I made a good life decision with the Healthy Nut options being just as delightful as the regular menu items all while introducing new twists on breakfast standards that really pop! I may have to start getting a weekly dose...",

    "text": "Wow, how have I not written a review for here yet!This is by far my favorite breakfast spot in Old Town. I go mainly for breakfast/brunch but I've been for lunch and dinner too and all have been good. Expect a wait for breakfast on the weekends but it's usually only about 20 minutes, and it goes by pretty quickly. They have chairs and water and coffee outside while you wait and you can also grab a drink from the bar. The waitresses are always really friendly and attentive and more times than not when I've been there, the owner has come around the tables and asked how everything is which I really like. I bring everyone who comes into town to visit me here and they all love it. I love their sangria (I prefer it on the rocks) as well as their bellinis and mimosas. All of the benedicts are great except the red pepper one, it just had a strange texture. All of the breakfasts come with two sides so you get a huge amount of food. I also love the Mahi Club and my friend ordered their soft pretzels the other day which I had never had and they were soooo good. Not salty or greasy at all just really, really good. I've also had their salmon and quinoa for dinner which was really tasty. They have a great summer happy hour, and I love their patio. Reasonably priced too. Riding my cruiser to DD for brunch makes for a perfect day in my book! I do have to advise though....my boyfriend got the bacon bloody mary once...let's just say you get about 15 bacon bits with every sip (they give you a giant straw like for boba tea).....not really conducive to a hangover.",

They have a really large menu so there's something for everyone and the service is also quick and friendly.

Even if you do have to wait, they have free coffee and water for you to enjoy.",

She's has great customer service and professionalism. I manage a business so I can spot quality people... She's one of them.  The food is always soooo good. I've tried everything from Benedicts, omelets, and breakfast sandwiches, and everything is on point. One of these days, I'll get the courage (and calorie-saving) for the breakfast nachos...

    "text": "I had high hopes after reading plenty of positive reviews on yelp. Not to mention being out of town, I wanted to go to place the locals went to and not just some chain restaurant.  We drove an extra 25 minutes to get to Daily Dose from our hotel. I was actually excited to try the breakfast.  My two breakfast weakness are eggs Benedict and Belgium waffles and it is always a challenge for me to choose one or the other.   At Daily Dose, I decided to try their  \"Strawberry Creme Brule\" Belgium waffle which sounded great from the description. It was going to be topped with fresh strawberries, vanilla bean creme brule & whipped cream. You also had to option with a choice of fresh fruit, cottage cheese or DD hash. I opted for the DD hash.  When the dish came out it looked quite nice as you can tell from the photo.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HCCg-rVnHQ2FI6lHs_LvUQ?select=gkkpOGnT5GmRuNBYx15zXA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/HCCg...</a>  However, eating it was another thing.  The whipped cream was fine, and the creme brule sauce was very sweet which substituted having to use regular maple syrup.  My issue with this Belgium waffle was the texture. As you cut through the waffle, it was like cutting through a very dense cake and it ended like a rock in my stomach for the next few hours. (no bueno) Most of the Belgium waffles I've had elsewhere are light and crispy.  I thought, \"Oh, maybe it was just my Belgium Waffle that was dense and cake like.\" However, my friend who ordered the blueberry version of the Belgium Waffle had the same complaint. He too never had such a dense cakey waffle before.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HCCg-rVnHQ2FI6lHs_LvUQ?select=XtVob_W2GT-ogi_csDEiLg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/HCCg...</a>  The DD hash ended up to be a sauteed squash which which was both sweet and savory, I think it is definitely and acquired taste.   The service was decent. Our coffee cups were never half empty.   There are both indoor and outdoor seating in the patio.  Perhaps it was a bad day to order Belgium waffle at DD, but sadly it left me feeling disappointed after being so excited to try this place out.",

We both thought we died and went to heaven because of this one dish. I also enjoyed my green chili pork omelette minus the cheese but the gluten free cinnamon, which I got as a side was certainly the star dish. The service here was attentive and friendly. I would fly back down to Scottsdale just for the gluten free cinnamon roll cake; no lies. I didn't even mention their adult coffee and morning beverages! The adult beverages really sealed the deal for me. If you live anywhere in the state of Arizona, you should really make a conscious effort to try Daily dose. I can't stop thinking about my orgasmic experience (figuratively speaking) when biting into the gluten free cinnamon roll cake.",

Just generally not very appetizing. And I'm pretty sure there was an eggshell in my fish. My daughter had the tavern ham eggs Benedict. Those were good and she really liked the sauce. The potatoes that came with it were heavily spiced with rosemary, which she doesn't like, so those were not good. The service was good. Not intrusive. Seemed to have a good balance.

Food: Strawberry Creme Brulee Belgium Waffle- this was okay, I wish it had more Creme brulee drizzle on top of the waffle.  DD Hash- omg so good!! So much flavor! This is an acorn squash, mushroom and onion. So ate every bite! I loved this side dish!  Southwest Flannel Hash- slices of corn beef with slices of jalapeno. This was tasty too!

There was a 15 minute wait which was okay but not a lot of room to wait inside, there were a few groups waiting and we were all a little crowded.  Sat at the bar and I agree with other reviews that the service was a bit slow, a lady with dark hair took my order and grabbed my drinks but I never saw her again until she brought the check, a runner from the kitchen brought our food and a different waiter checked on my group after we were eating. I got the fresh squeezed OJ which was really good and a great start to the morning! I ordered the Banana Bread French toasted with potatoes and a side of scrambled eggs. The french toast was very sweet and overfilled with pecans. The potatoes were pretty bland and looked frozen instead of fresh.  My scrambled eggs where perfect. It looked like they had a good selection of coffee, mimosas, and beer. I would come back for drinks and something basic but probably won't order any big item off the menu again.",

It took a long time for our order to be taken, and brought out, but the really long wait was afterward.

I ordered the veggie omelet that supposed to come with asparagus and if there was any in there it must have been just a few flecks. What I wasn't expecting in it and really could have done without were green and red peppers which wasn't mentioned on the menu description. The best past of my meal was the butternut squash hash; very good, very tasty, cooked perfectly. I opted for a biscuit instead of toast and it was okay, I've certainly have had better, larger and flakier biscuits. These weren't much better than Pillsbury biscuits. My husband had something he thought was not only unique but delicious and spicy. He ordered the chorizo and jalapeno corncakes and loved it. He also ordered a tequila sunrise and thought it was excellent. My mother ordered the strawberries and creme waffle and the waffle was great, thick and perfect and very large, delicious; I tried it and it was very good. Could have been a 5 star waffle if it didn't have whipped cream from a can. Service was excellent, friendly and efficient especially considering how busy they were. I'm sure we will return considering how much my husband enjoyed it. I guess I'll just try something different next time.",

Very quicks service to place orders and receive food-- a little slower on drink refills. The prices are decent for the location. It's a fun atmosphere and if you can snag a table outside, it would be a great place to take out of town guests or someone really looking to enjoy the weather during breakfast.  I had the Lox omelette- smoked salmon, capers, and red onions. Incredibly salty (which is to be expected, but this was kinda unreal) but pretty good. The bloody mary wasn't my favorite, but then again I didn't try the bacon bloody mary.... maybe next time.",

We were seated in a large booth and a waitress came immediately to take our drink orders. They serve their water with cucumbers in it, which is unfortunate if you don't like cucumbers.   I order the Shaved Turkey Melt (Thin shaved house roasted turkey topped with caramelized jalapenos & red onion, creamy brie & chipotle mayonnaise on sourdough. 9.99), which sounded very flavorful but was pretty lackluster. I didn't notice caramelized jalapenos, onions or brie - only turkey. The bread was pretty hard so it was difficult to eat.   I would not return.",

We had spoken to a manager weeks before because they didn't take reservations but were told they could accommodate a big party if we were to get there a little early. The day of, I called and they said to come in 20-30 min before to set it up.I got there 40 minutes before the rest of the guests were to arrive. When I got there, they said they had filled up and was going to have to wait...so I waited..and then waited...I waited for an hour an a half. I kept checking in with the hostess and \"manager\" who were super rude and kept telling me to wait. Our entire party arrived and we were still waiting. My sister told the manager that the hostess was very rude and he didn't seem to care. They were pretty terrible. Finally, we got seated. We ordered our food, all the food came out except for mine and my sisters (thankfully not the bride) and we waited...everyone finished with their meals and ours was still not there. Finally it showed up, and guess what? A hair in my sisters food! The waitress didn't seem very apologetic but they didn't charge us. Just for our coffee, which I thought was lame too. It wAs a pretty awful experience and we won't be going back. Thanks a lot daily dose for ruining a bachelorette brunch with your rude service!",

I really liked that they provided coffee and water while we waited (although the water tasted terrible).  Once we were sat we were greeted by a really friendly waitress who was very attentive the whole meal, kuddos!  The mimosas here are really great, you can definitely tell the orange juice is freshly squeezed with just the right amount of pulp.  Food took awhile to get to the table but was worth the wait.  I ordered the chorizo mac n cheese and my boyfriend ordered the hickory ham eggs Benedict; my dish was tasty but I felt they skimped on the chorizo, the eggs Benedict was really delicious though!  The side of fruit that came with my meal was enormous and mostly delicious; I could tell that some of the watermelon pieces were beyond freshness.  Overall we had a really pleasant meal but I don't think I'd ever go out of my way to return.",

    "text": "Daily Dose is hands down my favorite restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale. I began going there when it first opened for brunch and was highly impressed by the multiple options they have available for the ways in which you can order Eggs Benedict. You can get them with roasted red pepper, asparagus, chorizo or my personal favorite...thinly sliced prime rib. In addition, they give you the option to order them \"DD style\" in which they replace the  english muffin and hollandaise sauce with a biscuit and gravy.   After enjoying their brunch on multiple occasions, I became curious about their happy hour. Not only do they have the most convenient happy hour schedule (4-8pm!) but their menu options are amazing as well. Unlike their morning hours during which there tends to be quite a wait time for a table, there is always availability during dinner time and the atmosphere is very comfortable. I don't think I have ever had anything from Daily Dose that was not to like.  Their sangria is delicious also :)   Some of my  favorite menu items:   Butternut Squash Ravioli   Prime Rib Eggs Benedict   Tacos (any)  Veggie Dip  Chicken Nachos (their salsa is great)   Panko Crusted Calamari  Cilantro, Jalapeno & Edamame Hummus  Chocolate Cake MMMmmm!",

    "text": "This review is for my recent experience. I've been to the restaurant many times so obviously the food is good.   The service however today was terrible. We walked up at 8:50 on Sunday morning and saw there was an available table fit for two on the patio. I requested the table and was told we could sit there. However, rather than seating us there at the perfectly clean and ready table we were told their server needed to catch up and it would take less than 10 minutes to get seated so we were put on the list, first ones up. No problem. 10 minutes go by and more and more people are walking in and getting their names put down. One family even sat at the specific table without putting their name down. I went to the front and asked if we were still waiting for that table. He explained the table was ours and they would ask the family to wait. That happens, but then another 10 minutes goes by (they seat 2 9tops that came in after us) and we are still standing outside staring at our table. I asked the host why and he said that the patio server was behind and they would rather us not wait at the table not being served. WTF. Obviously I would rather sit at a table with some water than stand on the other side of the fence staring at it. Apparently it would have been above his or anyone else's job to bring us two glasses of water and let us sit comfortably. On top of it I said, you do realize you sat 18 people whose food orders will now go in ahead of ours. He said I know, and I'm sorry. Ooookaayyy.   When a server is down your management needs to step in. We left because the whole situation was super rude and after a certain point it seems that our satisfaction and business didn't matter at all.   This is Arizona, your patio server should be your most capable. And you should probably have more than one.",

She said she gets them every time she goes to Daily Dose. I would highly recommend the freshly squeezed orange juice. I was debating about getting it because it was $4 and I was like, is it really worth $4? But it is! It actually does taste freshly squeezed. This was my first time coming here and I waited about 20 minutes to be seated. My friend says it's always crowded when she comes, so be prepared to wait when you come. But you know, when you have to wait, that means a lot of people like eating at this restaurant. I would recommend this place to other people.",

The fruit that came on the side didn't taste very fresh and the roasted potatoes had cumin on them which kind of threw me off. The prime rib was tender and the hollandaise sauce was on point. Breakfast nachos had this really good queso dip and the salsa was light and fresh--truly enjoyed this dish a lot.   Our server was super nice and the food came out fast.

The hangover breakfast is much more fun and they have great options to choose from  Breakfast nachos are by far the best to enjoy with a bloody mary.  They are everything bad for you that you shouldnt start your day with.  If you want less guilt, share them with a friend. But dont share with the whole table, the plate will easily disappear and you'll regret your generosity.  Ginger snap granola is so delish!! So tasty and flavorful! This isn't \"healthy\" -- so don't tell yourself it is.  If you want healthy, they have some egg white option omlettes that are pretty good, filling, and generous portions.  I only got one once because they are nothing too special compared to the rest of the fun menu.    Its fun to sit outside and watch the people walking by on Scottsdale road.  I've sat inside twice but outside is much more fun.  Their patio is dog friendly.    The service on weekend is slow --- be prepared to wait. They make the wait less painful with a coffee and water stand and nice chairs to sit on.  It is a common hangover breakfast spot, so the lines are full of some haggard looking zombies on saturday and sundays. However, its also a great place to meet with a group of people and enjoy a meal.  I've eaten dinner there twice. The menu for dinner is not my fave.  They do have great apps to share with friends, but to be honest, there are plenty of other places in the area at same price point that does a better dinner.  Stick with Daily Dose for breakfast or lunch, and you will have a happy full belly :) ...followed shortly by a nap.",

Oddly enough a girl friend and I sat at the bar a couple weeks ago and had really slow service.  =/  Usually I choose the bar because your server is always right in front of you if you need something, but that didn't quite work out here.   Happy hour goes every day of the week until 8pm, so that's a bonus!  I've had brunch, lunch, dinner and happy hour here ... They have lots of options for herbivores like myself and carnivores alike.  The cocktail menu is good and their sangria is tasty.  The wait times can be extensive on the weekends for breakfast/brunch, so plan accordingly.",

    "text": "Daily Dose does the trick. Enough so that I ate breakfast here two days in a row. And while I'm sure this bar and restaurant serves many different purposes to many different people, I think I can tell that breakfast would be my main reason for stopping in here.   What do I like about it? Well, the menu is diverse and easily customizable. Both days I wanted to get some protein heavy, low carb options and while they do have some pretty healthy stuff already on offer, I chose to go the omelet route and sub out some the taters and toast for other stuff, like cottage cheese, other proteins, etc. And I got zero hesitation or argument. Yay! Nice and easy. The food itself? Tasty. Nothing uber gourmet or mind-blowing, but I can tell they're using better than average ingredients, and said ingredients are put together well.   Service was quick and friendly on both visits. And weekday breakfasts, at least around 730 am, are pretty quiet. So it's get in, get eatin', and get on to work. BOOM!   Not really my style/vibe for other meals/occasions, I value this kind of food and service and quality for breakfast. Normally I have to work hard to get away from the starch-driven meals that dominate breakfast menus, but here they're ready for me and my quirky needs. Dig it!",

The service was friendly (although a few times we were wondering where our waitress was), and I was thankful to have a decent cup of coffee sitting in front of me. After much pondering of the menu which is absolutely huge, I decided to go the healthy route & order the egg white wrap. For $9.99, you get the wrap with bell peppers, mushroom & spinach in a chipotle tortilla, served with pico de gallo, herb potatoes and fruit. The wrap was okay but the pico was completely necessary to add any flavor. The fruit was surprisingly good, but the potatoes tasted so strongly like herbs that it was hard to really enjoy them.  Here's the thing... not everything needs to be a five-star meal. This spot is convenient for breakfast AND you can get something healthy, which I value a great deal. While I won't be dying to come back here, I wouldn't rule it out as a breakfast option the next time I'm in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "Let me start that hands down this spot for breakfast is the best in town and my go to for classic breakfast dishes.    The location is right in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale and is very easy to find. There is parking on the street and a few parking spots that are not too far, but I usually go early for breakfast, so this may not be the case later on in the day when its far hotter during the AZ summer.   The spot has plenty of seating, including some outside and a bar.  There are tables and booths and its nice yet very casual.   For less than $15 (which includes a non-alcoholic bev, I usualy get coffee--it's very yummy here and you can grab one while you wait and even ask for one to go). I am a fan of the omelettes and really like the veggie, turkey, capreses and steak. To be honest I haven't tried one I don't like. The acorn squash hash is so sweet and savory served with an herbed creme fraiche--I ALWAYS get it instead of the potatoes (however, my guests LOVE them, I am a bigger fan of squash). The breakfasts are HUGE, like really generous.  The eggs come with hash, a small bowl of fruit and a side of bread, which can be a biscut or bagel. They have an amazing kids menu as well filled with real food for the kiddos.  The hosts and staff have always been so sweet to my toddler daughter and any guests I bring with. They serve alcohol as well, i don't think I've tried anything but the Bloody Marys look amazing.   They've never let me down, so I'll keep heading over to this spot for breakfast. If you are in the area, I encourgage you to try it too!",

Daily Dose is definitely not a secret so expect a wait on a weekend morning. We waited about 30 minutes for a table. The restaurant does provide cucumber water and coffee outside to enjoy while you wait.   The Chorizo & Jalapeno Corncakes were calling my name. This was one of the best breakfast items I've ever had. So simple and yet so delicious. The cornbread pancakes with chorizo and jalapeno were delicious. The cheese sandwiched between the pancakes was just icing on the cake of this dish. Of course to send it over the edge the dish is topped with two eggs. The serving was huge and while you'll want to eat every last bite you most likely won't be able to eat it all. For my side I went with the DD Hash which was a roasted butternut squash. That was delicious with a nicely flavored seasoning on top.  My husband had the Pumpkin Crunch pancakes that were on special that weekend. I snuck a few bites and found it to be quite delicious. The rest of our family also raved about their breakfasts. We were six happy diners for sure.",

Since they do not take reservations and there was ~10 of us, one of my friends arrived earliest to wait. Luckily they have a coffee stand for the wait, since Saturday morning is a busy time for brunch! They promised us 2 tables together as 2 separate groups were getting up at the same time, and not even 5 minutes later they begin to seat us, but at different sides of the restaurant. A little upsetting that they did that.   Our server was great, but I didn't catch her name. If you exclude alcohol, expect to spend ~$10-15 here. I opted for the Grapefruit Fizz since it sounded fruity. Really fresh and delicious drink to choose! The cinnamon roll pancakes that one of my friends ordered looked great, and I had a little regret ordering the crispy polenta eggs benedict. Decent, but I could've gone without the poblano, made it a little too spicy for my tastebuds. The potatoes were bland, but the DD hash was great!   Worth going back another time to try something else in hopes of finding something else on the menu that is as good as the hash & Grapefruit Fizz.",

We started with the breakfast nachos. Quite a unique combination of chorizo, eggs, and cheese over chips.  I will be returning",

The Eggs Benedict was delicious, and you can substitute a homemade fresh biscuit which really adds to the experience. The Strawberry Creme Brulee French toast was delicious, piled high with fresh strawberries and the sauce was not too overwhelming. Their house herb potatoes were delightful! The service was great, answering all our questions, and wasn't afraid to suggest items on the menu which I always enjoy!",

Both plates were amazing! My waffle tasted like dessert and I couldn't finish it. I tasted my friend's crab cake eggs benedict and it was heavenly. I will order that next time!!   As far as drinks, I had a peach bellini and my friend tried one of the bloody marys. She was excited because they had five or six different kinds of bloody marys to choose from. Personally it's not my thing, but she said it tasted great. The bellini was sweet but I would recommend getting a double.   Our server was nice and attentive but not bothersome. We arrived relatively early (around 915) so there wasn't any wait to sit down, but by the time we left, the entrance was full of people waiting for tables. The atmosphere of the restaurant was pleasant and hip without being too aggressive. Unlike other places in Old Town, the music wasn't blasting and I didn't feel like I was at a club for breakfast. I enjoyed the food and will come back soon!",

    "text": "My friends rave about this place so on a recent trip to Scottsdale, I decided to give it a go.  Know that for brunch you are going to wait.  So put your name in and go outside and sit on the curb or in one of the chairs provided as we easily were there for 45 minutes before being called.  Once called we started to go over the large menu.  I wanted an omelette and my friend was hankering for eggs Benedict.  They came and were good but the real winner had to be the pancakes at the table next to us,  They smelled so good I was trying to stay in my seat and not grab them off of their table.  I actually had \"pancake envy\" and if I hadn't just eaten my days worth of calories in one sitting, I might have ordered my own fluffy cake from heaven.  Anyway. Back to what we did order.  My Bloody Mary was okay but not worth the extra money to get the bacon one (where I come from, bacon bloodies have long strips of maple soaked bacon in them not the chopped bacon here that merely stopped up my straw)  And my omelette was good but not exciting.  And even the sweet potato hash brown mix didn't do it for me.  Know there is a full bar so after breakfast we wandered over there to sit, drink and wait for the rain to stop.  That actually was the highlight of our visit as the bartenders were trying to deal with a woman who had been \"over served\" at brunch and was proceeding to embarrass herself at the bar . . .made for some live drama!  If you drive, there is usually street parking on the blocks surrounding the restaurant.   The prices are reasonable, the servers are on their game, and the coffee is good so a solid showing in my opinion.  I just wanted it to live up to my friends recommendation . . . .and it didn't.",

    "text": "...and with a few passive-aggressive words, Daily Dose lost one of their most loyal customers (to see just how much I have enjoyed DD's great service and wonderful food, please read my prior review, below; it's long been my favorite breakfast spot in Old Town).  Our server was genuinely friendly and she swiftly brought out coffee, water, a couple of really yummy mimosas (it's Easter morning, so why not!) and then took our order.  Coincidentally, we both ordered the Turkey Sausage White-Out omelet (four egg whites filled with turkey sausage and mozzarella... bowl or fruit & multi-grain toast on the side); another server brought them out surprisingly quickly, I mean immediately after our order, which is when things began feeling not quite right.  Before I cut into the omelet, I put my finger on it because it didn't look hot, and it wasn't (it was a little warmer than room temperature); I cut a small bite -- the same, just kind of warm.  This made no sense... I had just placed the order and they just brought it from the kitchen.  Before I said anything about my omelet, my friend said, \"I'm sending mine back, this isn't right\".  I cut my omelet in half and touched the turkey sausage in the middle... it wasn't frozen but it was still cool.  I asked my friend, \"Restaurants don't pre-make and reheat omelets, do they?\"  I thought this might explain why they came out from the kitchen so quickly and also why they weren't really hot.  She shrugged, \"I wouldn't think so...\".    I really really really dislike being that pretentious/entitled guy who sends back food because it's not to his liking, so when our server checked back with us I tried to politely tell her that the eggs were just barely warm and... -- before we could finish she very courteously took up both of our plates and shook her head saying, \"I'm so sorry, don't worry about it, I'll take care of it right away!\" (I wish that we'd have gotten her name so we could recommend her!)  But then, Immediately thereafter, the manager on duty came over, put the palms of his hands down on the corners of our table and asked, \"So, you want your omelets scalding or what?\".    The passive-aggressiveness of the question was so surprising that I could only think to say, \"I'm sorry?\"  \"I just wanted to know if you wanted them scalding,\" he replied.  I tried to explain that the omelets were just barely warm, the turkey in the middle was cold, etc., but he asserted \"I checked it in the kitchen, it was hot\".  I explained that we both thought they seemed to be reheated but he insisted, \"I picked them up in my hands, they were both hot\".  Sort of stunned, I looked at my friend and said, \"Then I guess we're the problem... We'll just pay for these [mimosas] and go,\" I said.  \"Don't worry about it,\" he said and walked away.  I put seven dollars on the table as a tip for our original server and we walked out the door, saddened about my old favorite...",

    "text": "Good food, great patio and friendly service; these are three Daily Dose highlights. After walking by the Dose several times in the last year, I've finally had a chance to visit a handful of times and I'm adding this to my list of weekend afternoon or happy hour stops.   I first visited for happy hour. I was pleased to learn that domestic beers were just $2 and they served them in ice cold glasses. Now for those who know me, they know that I don't typically drink beer from a glass. Not sure why, but there's just something about drinking out of a bottle. But, in the case of the Daily Dose, I went with the glass this time because it was so cold it chilled the beer to perfection. After reading so many reviews about the Daily Dose burger, I had to give it a try. Not bad burger lovers. The pretzel bun added to the taste and the burger was solid. The fries were OK. I had the combo but preferred the regular fries to the sweet potato ones. One thing that surprised our group was that the restaurant does last call at 9 on the weekdays, so we noted that this isn't your choice for making it a late night.   The second time I visited, my friend and I split the citrus avocado salad with cilantro lime dressing and the shaved turkey melt with brie. I really liked the unique kick to the salad due to the combo of fruit and avocado. It was a refreshing bed of greens. The turkey melt was a combination of brie, jalapenos and chipotle mayo on sourdough bread. It's a great sandwich if you're in the mood to consume some cheesy calories.   Both times, I've enjoyed the food and will definitely remember the Daily Dose when my tummy starts growling again.",

    "text": "I have wanted to try the Daily Dose since I heard about it last year at a Yelp event. I met up with a friend last night for dinner & drinks, and we chose DD as the location. I did arrive early - around 5 and was surprised to see the place was nearly barren. There was only one other table occupied. Happy Hour was 4-8, so I entertained myself with a $2.50 Miller Lite until my friend arrived.  This is a good place for happy hour - half off apps, $2.50 domestics, $3.00 Mexican beers (although the menu shows Tecate and Tecate Light at $2.50). When she arrived we listened to the server's suggestion and ordered the pulled chicken & mushroom rolls. Basically egg rolls with chicken, mushroom & cheddar cheese with a horseradish aioli drizzle. Fairly tasty and for half off the regular $8.95 price, a pretty good deal. I had another Miller Lite and she enjoyed the Three Olives $5 vodka special by mixing root beer vodka with vanilla vodka. It was a good and interesting blend.  We still had time on the happy hour menu and remained a little hungry. I wanted to try one of the burgers I have heard so much about. We decided to share the Gladiator ($11.95). It sounded large and spicy! A large Australian Kobe beef topped with cheddar & jack cheese, caramelized jalapenos & onions, peppered bacon & red chili cheese sauce on a toasted pretzel bun. Yum! And the pretzel bun sounded interesting. When it arrived it was large, I will give it that. The servers knew we were splitting the burger and already divided it in half and brought it on two plates for us. Big props to the staff. To be honest, I didn't note anything spicy. The bacon was good and crunchy, but I didn't detect jalapenos or anything spicy. The pretzel bun I was looking forward to trying didn't really stand out to me either. I couldn't tell the difference between that and a regular wheat bun. I asked my friend to see if perhaps it was just me, but she concurred.  By this time it was 9:00, and as Lindsey F.'s review stated, that's the end of the night. During my visit a few other people had come and gone, mostly at the bar, but it was quieter than I expected. We noticed that at 9 we were the only ones left and we thought the staff might get antsy.   Overall the Daily Dose was nice. I thought the atmosphere was good, some televisions to watch the games, a little jazz in the background and some good happy hour prices. I wouldn't mind trying the burger again to see if I was missing something. It was good; don't get me wrong, but not exactly what I was expecting. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I will definitely revisit.",

I had the Southwest Flannel Hash AND the Banana Nut Bread French Toast (I thought my friends would try some of the French Toast, I was wrong). Both portion sizes were quite adequate for most appetites. Both were also fantastic. I'm going into a food coma. Service (Miranda, if I'm not mistaken) was quick and friendly. Despite a full restaurant and bar, our food didn't take long at all to come out. I will definitely be back.",

It is a cute, trendy, busy, small establishment packed with lots of patrons with Gucci bags slung over their arms and cute little designer sun dresses on their backs.    The waitress we had was not rude but could definitely have been friendlier. We took about 20 minutes to order, so that could have been a reason for her rudeness. But, I didn't see her smile once.   The food was ok. Not really anything to write home about and the Sunday special of Sangria was very watered down.   I will probably go back again because it is a great spot to go and have Sunday brunch with the girls- but it wont be my 1st choice.",

    "text": "As crazy as I was about Tucson, I was rapidly let down by the next town I saw, the manicured Scottsdale, which, though the oldest town in the Old West or something, is the Scarsdale of Arizona.  So funny that the Yelp headquarters is in a place where dentists and their wives with straightened hair, Laura Mercier eyeshadow, dressed up in judicious straight legged jeans and expensive bomber jackets paint the town red by going out to restaurants with a glass of wine after.  Much as they got it poppin in West Hartford and Bronxville where I lived.    Its Old Town cedes any claim to baddest town in the West cred because it's a winking, hyper commercialized homage, replete with jewelry and souvenir stores.  However.  Its center is a manicured selection of huge, spacious restaurants, some aspiring to trendiness, some getting there (such as The Pink Pony, Bandera, and the Mission with its sprawling, romantic interior which we couldn't afford.)  Instead, we headed over to the Daily Dose because of a recommendation that didn't come from Fodor's.  The Daily Dose is a spruced up trendy-ish bar restaurant slightly away on Scottsdale Rd from trendy restaurant row, with spruced up, good, solid bar lunch and dinner food.  Except the food happens to be very good and dependable.    The mango mojito was somewhat girly and candied, but good with mango chunks bubbling up the wide bubble tea straw.  The calamari, sweet lord the calamari.  It is made from a softer, less chewy part of the calamari and paired with a mustard sauce.  Highly recommended to share!  I tried the rock shrimp taco on the waitress' recommendation which was a small mess of somewhat unfrozen shrimp, cabbage, and mayo, so less recommended.  However, the turkey burger she also recommended was very good!  Tender with cheese and a couple avocado pieces on top.  Guaranteed to devolve into a food coma after 30 minutes.  The second time we came, my family tried more good things, but I was less impressed with the dull carnitas with corn salsa and beans on the side.  As far as the service, both of the women who served us were accommodating and friendly, but with a slight edge of de facto faux Southern charm that I hear Phoenix and Scottsdale sometimes ally themselves with.  I thought that the service in Flagstaff and Tucson was more sincere, but I'm biased because I like them better.  Plus, I imagine that Scottsdale is one of those places like Dallas where women \"put on their face\" for an hour just to go throw out the garbage.  And a woman who sometimes doesn't wash her face, like me, would be shunned.",

There is usually a long wait here...but we arrived about 10 am and there was no wait. We were seated very quickly and the service was very good...there was a little wait for our food but no complaints about that though. I had 2 great buttermilk pancakes, turkey sausage, eggs, potatoes, and hash...the price....only 9 bucks plus tax...a really great deal. So if your ever in Old Town Scottsdale and need a great breakfast to get your day started...visit this establishment. Eat, Drink, and Be Merry my Friends!!!!!",

After one of those, I just had to eat something! Well, hello Kobe burger! I chose the Daily Dose burger which 8oz is topped with cheddar & jack, peppered bacon, fresh basil, shaved onion, tomato & harissa aioli on a toasted pretzel bun! Whew! The burger was tasty and the pretzel bun was a master stroke. The meat was juicy and cooked to order (medium for me). The toppings added to the flavor of the burger and the pretzel bun was chewy and salted just like a YUMMY pretzel. I was a happy girl!   I hope to visit Daily Dose for breakfast, maybe a lunch! I hope they can wow me like they did before!",

I have been there several times and I always leave with mixed reviews.  I went to Daily Dose on Friday for happy hour/dinner.  I did not know they had happy hour till 8 pm, which wins bonus points!  I highly recommend The Antioxidant:   Three Olives Pomegranate Vodka, Three Olives Mango Vodka,  lemonade, green tea and peach nectar.  One word: Yummy!  The Crab Cakes were delicious and the presentation was fabulous!  I even took a picture!  There are two blue crab cakes and hidden underneath them is a surprise of edamame and roasted red pepper. The charred tomatilla hollandaise was a great addition.  I willing to give this location a shot especially now that I know they have a happy hour that goes till 8 pm.",

We were seated immediately outside on the patio and the staff was very nice. Every waitress that passed us asked if we had our drink order taken yet, although it was repetative it was being thorough. I love that they serve cucumber water and their orange juice is hand squeezed too. I ordered the southwest flannel hash, which was a wonderful, flavorful take on the classic corned beef hash. I loved this dish sooo much, I don't know if I would be able to order anything else on my future visits. The meat was cooked so well, along with the potatoes, tomatillos and onions. It came with 2 perfectly cooked and seasoned eggs and one of the best quality white toast I've had. The butter was even impressive and spread so easily. My bf got the chorizo omelet with potatoes and it was really good too. The waitress was very friendly and made sure to check on us consistantly. We saw that they have a great sounding happy hour and plan to come back and give it a try! I would recommend Daily Dose for breakfast!",

    "text": "Ok, so I'm back in Scottsdale after 4 years living abroad, & I wanted to get breakfast from one of my favorite places for breakfast near my place.   I was dining solo, so I asked the hostess for a seat at the bar. After a few minutes a place opened up & she sat me. I then proceeded to enjoy a delicious meal that included a chorizo omelette, a pancake, & a couple of delicious beverages.   When I was almost finished with my meal, a woman, not am employee, walks up & asks me to move. People around me had left, & now there was a chair on either side of me. I told her I was almost finished with my meal, & I'd be moving soon. She left to go into the bathroom. I the meantime, a lovely restaurant employee simply moved a chair to where her & her friend could immediately sit down. There was plenty of space for them without me moving.   They returned from the bathroom a few minutes later. As she was sitting down, she loudly said, I can't believe she's still sitting there. I was finished, & waiting for my bill at this point. I had ordered an Uber. I closed my check, & as I was leaving I walked over & said she might want to be a bit more considerate next time someone is in the middle of eating.   Then I left to head to my Uber, which was arriving. As I'm walking down the sidewalk, this crazy woman has chased me outside & is shouting at me. It was actually insane. I kept walking away, got in the car & left.   I called the restaurant to let the manager know what happened, & she was super nice. She said they only allow hostesses to seat at the bar on the weekends, so people don't feel rushed. She apologized & left a gift card for me, which was super nice. I only hope she didn't say anything to the mentally ill lady who chased me down the street. I'd be afraid for her safety.",

They have a few patio tables, at the time they were full so we waited at the bar for one to open up.   Only about 10 minute wait we were seated.

I say hellllll no.  I am not waiting 30 min for food.  And drive and find another breakfast place witch was fine.    This past weekend.  I toke my partner to AZ.   And on Sunday we went there for breakfast.  Line again.   And the host say 15 min.   I say ok. Let's wait and see what the damn big deal.  I just hate to wait for food.    15-20 min after. They got us a seat.   The host have a spot on the bar 5 min before.  I say no.  I will wait for a table.    From the min we seat.  Let me tell you whole !   This is worth every damn min I was waiting ! And I am picky person. I know that.    The service ? 10 stars .   Wow.  3 people.  Every min come to look at us.  And make sure we good.  Water.  Coffee.   Just checking on us. It was just wow.  So amazing.    Then the food we order.   Huge plates.  Lots of food.  Taste the best.    No wonder they have such a line.     Next time. I will fu.king wait 40 min for a table there.   Not many places I went for food.  And was so pleased.      I know every one have an opinion but.  How can a place and service like that can even have less the 5 stars ?    Really ?    I am from SF.  We get amazing food places here.   But this place is way way one of the best I ever visit.     Will go there again soon as I visit Scottsdale !",

While we waited to be sat there was complimentary coffee which definitely made waiting more bearable. When we were finally sat, our server was super kind! My mom order huevos rancheros which to her were sub par. It came with a tortilla which we weren't quite sure what to do with considering the bulk of the meal was a bit soupy. I ordered the tavern hams eggs Benedict. The hollandaise sauce was delicious and the eggs were cooked perfectly! But the potatoes that came with the meal were not my cup of tea. They used Rosemary in the seasoning which is not something I enjoy. We both left a bit hungry. While our experience with the staff was great, the food was not!",

We had no great expectations and as we were walking in the downtown area of old Scottsdale decided to have lunch at The Daily Dose.  We never heard of it or about it before, but their menu looked interesting.  WOW, we were blown away!  The chef at this restaurant really knows what they are doing.  Our meals were the SW Chicken Salad and the Po-Boy (chicken) with a chef salad.  The flavors, freshness, taste, and portion sizes were excellent.  Be sure to try the \"crispies\" (cheese bread) that comes with the salad.  It is awesome.  The overall value was OK too.  Two of us plus coffee for both came to about $30.  The service was very good as well.  Do not pass this one up, if you get a chance to eat here.  You will not be disappointed, for sure.",

We were still in the middle of our meal and had half a glass of wine each left, it was strange. Maybe she was just in a rush to get done with work for the night.

Everything was completely over-seasoned, so much so, that i could only eat half the food, and I was starving. Do not get the special hash and the potatoes on the same plate, they are seasoned nearly identically and would require you to drink a gallon of water to even attempt to finish it all. The quality of everything else though is fairly good though and i think this is why it is popular here. Maybe just stick with waffles and pancakes, they did look pretty good.

It was perfect weather for brunch outside. I'd say the only thing that put a damper on this experience (which has nothing to do with the establishment, its food or its service!) was the out-of-the-norm-LOUD people sitting around us. Oh well, it will happen anywhere right?  The patio had a big TV right next to our table so my man was able to catch some football and ignore the loud mouths around us which was nice. The menu is amazing. How many places serve breakfast until 4pm AND have two pages worth of breakfast options?? My heaven. Our server was great. Had an awesome and energetic personality but wasn't annoying or overly helpful. She came when she needed to and let us enjoy our meal the rest of the time. I appreciate that. I wasn't the biggest fan of the cucumber water they bring out. I LOVE that they are taking the initiative to offer great services by placing either cucumber, lemon, etc... into your water BUT for some reason, the cucumber wasn't doing it for me that morning and I had to ask for a plain water. No biggie.   We ordered the mixed berry protein pancakes and the stuffed portabello mushroom with redbell pepper, egg and cheese. A side of fruit, rye toast and cottage cheese. Lets just say, I almost didn't need to eat for the rest of the day. SO MUCH FOOD.  The meal after tip was around $27 and that is without mimosas or bloody mary's. We don't live super close to here so this will be a trip for when I'm craving those amazing pancakes! If you live near this place, its Regular Status worthy for sure.",

    "text": "ZuZu? Orange Table?  D'lish? The Breakfast Club?  OR Daily Dose?  This is what I pondered early Sunday morning as I planned to meet friends for brunch.  After reading numerous Yelp reviews and a few other sites, Daily Dose was the decision!   The four of us were seated outside at a raised table.  Nice!  Inside seemed really claustrophobic and dark, so to be outside was great.  Our waitress was slow to arrive, but time passed easily as we were caught up in conversation.  I had read that Daily Dose had the BEST Bloody Marys in town.  So we all ordered one.  I love celery in mine, but I guess they do not garnish with celery, but the waitress said she would do it if I wanted.  We all ordered them spicy too.  We couldn't wait!!!!!!!  But we DID wait........and wait.......and wait......and wait, well you get my drift.  They finally came!  With a green onion as a garnish!?!  OK, Celery?  Oh, it WAS in there, just a tiny short piece that was halfway down the glass.  Well, she did have it in there.   The menu item choices were impressive!  They looked so creative!  I was excited to order! We ordered the breakfast nachos, which everyone on Yelp raved about!  We also ordered the eggs benedict with prime rib and the Southwest Flannel Hash.  And then we waited, and waited and waited...... EVERYONE on the patio had no food.  NONE!  I love looking at what other people have ordered, but not one person on the \"packed\" patio had food.  Not in any stage- just starting, just finishing, in the middle, nothing.  Many did not have anything but water.  I couldn't believe how long the service took.    FINALLY, our food came with no apology of how long it took.  I shared our order of nachos and prime rib eggs benedict.  The eggs benedict looked good, but when I cut into it, it was a snotty, white mess of undercooked egg white.  In my experience, the only runny part should be the yoke, right?  Well, although I would have preferred the white to have been cooked, my husband and I ate it anyway.  The prime rib was virtually nonexistent.  The breakfast nachos were a HUGE disappointment.  The chorizo was more like flavorless ground meat.  No zing or heat.  The scrambled eggs on it were dry, overcooked, and tasted of sulfur - which is what happens to scrambled eggs when they are over cooked.  There was supposed to be mozzarella cheese on them.  Where?   I don't know, but the nachos were covered in a gluey sauce that I assume was supposed to be a nacho cheese of some sort?  There was also a cup of the gluey sauce on the side.  I guess they felt we needed more? The chips were so greasy, most were translucent.  We didn't eat most of it, just tried to pick and find the edible parts.  By that time we were so hungry and who knows where our 18 year old waitress was to make a complaint anyway.  My friend's Southwest Flannel Hash, which she let me sample, were the WORST I ever had.  I mean how can you mess up corned beef hash?  There was a weird sweet component to it.  She did not finish it, which is odd because she loves corned beef hash and always finishes it.  Her Husband had the prime rib eggs benedict like I did.  He is in the restaurant industry and manages a very popular resort restaurant and he was not happy with his meal at all.  Especially the prime rib part.  I was with him on that one.  To wrap up our  two and  1/2 hour brunch  experience (yes it took that long from start to finish due to slow service) Daily Dose was flat bland, busy and overpriced.   Sorry brother and sister Yelpers, I am in disagreement on this one.",

    "text": "I was in Scottsdale for only a week, and I ate at Daily Dose three times. That's how awesome it is. You have to try the breakfast nachos if you're there at the right time: Warm corn tortilla chips topped with mozzarella and cheddar cheese, jalapenos, chorizo scrambled eggs, pico de gallo and red chili cheese sauce. Served with a side of sausage gravy. I said I was on vacation. That included from my diet. I'll be dreaming of those tonight.",
