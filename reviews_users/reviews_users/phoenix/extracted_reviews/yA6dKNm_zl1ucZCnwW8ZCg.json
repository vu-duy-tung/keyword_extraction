    "text": "We decided to start our bachelorette party here. Nothing crazy, just a simple dinner and a group of seven girls . We originally made the reservation for five people, however we had two girls join at the last minute. This was a huge deal for the owner. When we first arrived he was extremely rude and told us we originally said five so now we have to wait. He then asked us if we were looking at him when he was talking? Not sure what he was implying but we were all listening and couldn't get over the fact that he smelled like booze. Once we finally sat down it took way over 10 minutes for our server to acknowledge us . When he did, the manager appeared and asked him to move a table. In the middle of our drink order, the server left and didn't come back for another five minutes!  Overall the food was okay, but the appealing customer service is what made our experience horrible.  The topper was at the end when we were finishing paying our bill a man came up to us and asked if we were finished. We said almost. He then proceeded to clear all of our drinks off the table. As if to say get out, we need this table. I will never be back here again.",

    "text": "My girlfriends and I were in old town Scottsdale for lunch. Came upon the Italian Grotto which smelled good, Frank Sinatra music playing and a lovely outdoor patio. We decided to stop and unfortunately met the owner Gary. We have never experienced such a rude, crass individual.  The cushions on the seats needed replaced, and the table was less than steady. However, this was not an issue in the grand scheme of things, as Gary became quickly ruder as the seconds sent by. Simple questions concerning the menu were met with contempt.  For example, he would not bring us glasses of water, but only bottled water that we had to pay for.....interestingly there were glasses of tap water galore at other tables.  It was hard to believe that 4 confident, smart and outspoken women would be left speechless by such overt disrespect for the patron.  As were about to get up and leave before ordering we were rescued by a new waiter; Kris. He was polite, kind and attuned to our needs.   By the way, the food was fine-nothing out of this world. The wine was good. The bathroom was disgustingly dirty.     As we looked back on the day and finally read the reviews about the angry, erratic, rude owner, we wondered if this was all a marketing ploy??  One might wonder if the health inspector should go in and assess not the food in this restaurant, but rather the environment.  As a local I will not be taking my out of town guests there again. In fact, I will be quite vocal with others about this disturbing restaurant encounter.",

This is located in Old Town Scottsdale on the corner of Main st and Scottsdale Rd.They serve dinner late, which was nice getting in from a late night flight. The food is phenomenal. The first time I had the baked ravioli. It was delish. On Thursday I had the Chicken Carolina (which was recommended to me by our server, Gary) and it was SO good. The soup and salad were both fresh that came with the meal. The salad dressings were made from scratch and the soup was fresh vegetable minestrone. You also are served bread (either plain or garlic) to dip in olive oil and vinegar. Our server was great! We enjoyed talking to him about sports and the bay area. I cannot wait to go back again and visit this place. The menu is huge and I plan on trying something new each time we visit.",

I ordered the Grande Lasagna and was told it was the same size as a normal Lasagna but with some extra sausage.  Well, it wasn't.  It looked like my poor lasagna was eaten whole by some sort of cheese monster, that was then killed, gutted, and served to me.  Why would I want more cheese on top of this pile of melted cheese?

The owner who was definitely drunk didn't listen to the problem I was having with my meal before blowing up... So here's what happened we walked in and it took 5 mins before anyone came to seat us, no biggie . The server comes up no apology or anything,but again no biggie . We are seated next to the kitchen door even though there are multiple tables available. I'm hungry so I don't say anything but at this point I'm feeling like this guy has something personal against me haha. He hands us our menus and walks away. No drink orders or anything! So I call him back and ask him to take our drink orders and he still has no apology... Who trained this guy? So he comes back to take our orders and I ordered the red snapper and my girlfriend orders a plate of spaghetti. The food arrives and to be honest it smelled good and I was excited to chow down... I took a bite and the taste was just off... I tried to eat it any way because I really didn't feel like dealing with the server again. But after maybe 5 bites I couldn't take anymore... I called over the server and told him that I think the fish may be old and that it has a bad taste he just looked at me like I was an idiot... And I  guess the owner heard me because he rushed to the table basically yelling that his fish is fresh and that the fish I was eating was just shipped that morning... I waited for him to finish and asked for my money back and told him we would take our business elsewhere. His face got red like I asked if I could kiss his wife or something...  He yells a bit louder now that the fish was half eaten and that we would have to pay for it... By this time the whole room is staring at us. I threw down some cash on the table and my girlfriend and I walked out....  This was by far the weirdest, worst restaurant experience of my life... These guys need to be shut down or need a change of ownership... You can't treat people the way they do and just get away with it because they are a \" New York\" style restaurant ... I've been to New York and the cabbies have more class than this man... Their 3 1/2 star rating is a joke!!",

The tirade went on for fifteen minutes until I had to ask him to be quiet. Food is alright but not worth the price and certainly not worth being exposed to such a toxic atmosphere. I still am astounded by the language the abhorrent man was using. I've only written a few reviews on yelp in the many years I've used it and this is the first negative one I have written. People like that don't deserve to own a business and I hope a manger sees this so they can know their filthy restaurant is only matched by the terrible disgusting attitude of the men who run this place.

Was a little slow with the wine and my choice was unavailable after having to wait a bit to find out. Second choice was ok as well. Food was disappointing - heavily drenched in red sauce (the girls had lasagne and chicken parmigiana) and although the chicken was good, the lasagne was bland and lacked flavour and seasoning. Interestingly it was served with a large rigatoni - not a traditional style lasagne. The veal dish was poor - the sauce was very watery (should have been thick and creamy), the pasta over cooked and a little bland. I love veal and have it often so I was very disappointed with this meal.. Unfortunately, things like this get poor reviews (from us Yelpers) and I'm sure this place generally is better.",

The Caesar salad would have been a lot better if the dressing was homemade. The baked ravioli and the chicken dish were good. lots of heavy cream sauce on the chicken alfredo, but that's what the meal is. The server made our experience worth the $70. From the greeting to the small chuckles through out the meals he was great! We will be back, and with such an extensive menu, id be excited to try another good dish.",

The waiter was far from personable and made us feel guilty for asking anything. My husband had the Chicken Parmesan which was over-breaded and mushy and not much better than a frozen dinner. I had the Chicken Carolina which was over-seasoned and did not live up to its description.  The bathrooms were also dirty and beat up. Would NEVER go back.",

When we found a table we liked, the tablecloth was a bit sketchy, so maybe they need some new linens and an overall spruce-up would not be a bad idea either. We had the infamous waiter nicknamed \"Meatball\" perhaps due to his rather big meatball stomach (on no, did I just body shame). Well I didn't name the guy, but he was proud of his nickname, but you can't be flirty with the female customers when you look like him. He did do a great job on the fresh pepper grinder and parmesan routine. I really enjoyed my $8 manicotti. The red sauce was deep and rich and the pasta was laced with a tasty ricotta cheese. My dining partner though claimed she got sick from her $8 lunch order of lasagna. The bread and butter was free, but watch out as Meatball will try and upgrade your bread and meals with his sweet talking. Otherwise, this is mainly for tourists, but I would get that dish again.",

Consensus says this owner is a real tool, and he can typically be counted on to make an ugly appearance in these predominantly one-star posts. With staff consistently following ownership's sorry customer service example, I can count on finding a new restaurant horror story here virtually every day. If it weren't for the fact that the food gets as much bad press as the folks at work here do, I'd pay the price of admission myself just to see this freakshow live and in person. Keep up the carnage, Italian Grotto. I love reading all about it.",

We asked to split a check- he said no.. Which was absolutely fine. His response was \"want me to read it to you?!\" He then proceeded to read it out loud to the restaurant and then \"lobbed\" (in his words) the menu to the table. I then approached him after to address is lack of professionalism. He refused to further address the situation. Think about it- 7 person party who is willing to spend over $100 a month. They're losing about 9k from us. Cheers!",

    "text": "This area is so packed, especially after a spring training game! I should have been weary when I was able to get a table here so quickly while the other places I wanted to check out had an hour plus wait time. I was on a schedule so had no choice.  I really went back and forth with the star rating. I enjoyed my main dish but service was horrible and my experience was ruined multiple times.  We started with wine and had to wait so long to even get the wine list, like c'mon how many times do I have to ask for it? We were looking at the menu and our server asked if we would like Garlic Toast. Sure why not we could use something to munch on while we waited for our food. He never mentioned it was a charged item, he made it seem like do you want water and bread that comes complimentary. So that was an awkward shock when the bill came. Especially when it was so tiny yet still like $9. I try to always get something new or something I can't get back home so when I saw the white Lasagna, I knew I had to order it. Picture this ribbons of noodles layered with ricotta cheese, spinach, mushrooms, and cream, then baked with mozzarella cheese. So much yum! It was in fact delicious, tiny but delicious! Our waiter was hanging out with other patrons and ignoring us so we skipped on ordering dessert. I overheard others complaining so it's not a one time thing.  This place has so much potential and is in such an ideal location!  Keep in mind on the patio you are subject to homeless asking for food or money and the drunken debauchery of tourists on vacation. Makes for great people watching but I could see some uncomfortable guests nearby. Don't leave your purse on your chair for sure!",

Looks like most of the people who work there had a really rough night and are taking smoke breaks. It's dark and dingy inside. We saw the lunch menu outside and were starving so we quickly sat down at the patio and ordered. The food was bland, basic, the sausage pink in the middle and the minestrone is more like zucchini seed soup. $120 for lunch for four of us, two children split spaghetti. One glass of wine. We're from out of town and made a bad choice when we were really hungry. Don't do it! I know we were ripped off. The check was handwritten and didn't make any sense. I just paid it and got my family out of there.  This place looks like it has some good history. I hope someone can save this place. It may have been a great in the past.",

The owner (Hard core guy from New York), think his name is Gary, set them straight and kicked them all out! It got a little ugly, but was awesome! Good to see there are still some people who aren't politically correct and don't take crap. He was looking out for his business and the waiting staff.  Kudos to him.

    "text": "The restaurant has a cute ambiance, but unfortunately that's about all it has going for it. The food was extremely overpriced for what you get... My husband had the chicken Parmesan which was clearly a frozen chicken breast.. It was tough and just very unappealing. I had the spinach ravioli which was 4 raviolis smothered in sauce...   The icing on the cake is we actually had to seek out our waiter to pay our bill after sitting for a good 20 minutes in which we saw the waiter just standing around. We are normally big tippers, but due to the horrible food and bad service our tip reflected that. The waiter then chased my husband down outside the restaurant to ask were we came from because he was obviously upset with his tip.  I usually like to keep to the positive praising of businesses, but this was a terrible experience for our first night in Scottsdale. If you're craving Italian DO NOT go here because you will be very disappointed",

    "text": "Don't waste your money here.  There are tons of great bars and restaurants in Old Town, places where they treat customers with respect and appreciate your business.  People have had good things to say about the food, but I couldn't tell you because I was not allowed to spend my money here.  I would certainly never come back to this place ever again.  We walked into the restaurant, and headed towards the bar which is in the back because I didn't see anyone up front who looked like they worked there.  I lagged a little behind my wife because I was looking for someone who worked there because there we're a several empty tables.  Next thing I know, my wife is being \"escorted\" out by some old guy and I hear \"Restrooms are for customers only\". I'm a little confused, and I say I was heading for the bar, to which he replies \"Not in here you're not. GO somewhere else.\" in a loud voice. At this point I was not even sure he worked there, because he was dressed casual and not like any of the employees I saw in the 30 seconds or so we'd been in the place. So he is pushing my wife out, not physically but by crowding her towards the door ranting \"It's not right\" over and over at a high volume.  I'm like, What just happened. I try to have a conversation with the guy outside, but just continues screaming at us.  Some guy comes up and blocks the owner and keeps telling me to \"walk away man\".  Not once did I ever raise my voice, despite being pretty angry at the treatment.  I am like, I am just trying to talk to the man to figure out what the heck just happened, and he keeps telling me to walk away. At his point I've realized the guy yelling at me is probably the owner.  We we walk around the block, and I go back into the restaurant because I'd like to address the disrespect my wife received. Again no one is up front so I wait.  A couple of minutes the owner or whomever comes from the back and asks if he can help me.  I'm thinking, you don't recognize me?  I mean if it were me, Id remember the appearance of someone I was shouting at, kicking of my restaurant, and yelling at on the sidewalk 15 minutes before, but apparently this must happen pretty often to not be memorable.  So I calmly say \"I'd like to have an adult conversation about what just happened.\"  Then the lightbulb goes on, and he mutters \"I don't want to talk to you\", proceeds to brush past me and walks outside.  Note he didn't even kick me out, he just pushed passed me and left, leaving me standing in the restaurant.  So I follow outside and ask very calmly \"Can I just talk to you for a second.\"  He starting into another tantrum standing on the sidewalk, saying \"I tried being nice, and it doesn't work\" over and over. At first I thought he might be drunk, based on his behavior and belligerent actions.  I can't be sure, but I honestly think this is just his personality, which in some ways is worse.  So he's got his back to me, and so I turn to leave and say something along the lines of \"Man, I've never been kicked out of someplace for walking up the bar.\".  So he yells at my back \"You don't just walk into a place!\"  I'm like, yeah you do, pretty much every restaurant I've ever been to.  If there is a host or hostess you say \"heading to the bar\"; and if not you just take an open barstool.  I've certainly never been removed from an establishment for simply walking in;  actually this the first time I've ever been removed, ever.  So the sad thing is, we aren't even tourists, were locals.  I'll be sure to let me friends know to stay clear of here.",

Halfway through the meal the older man (who we figured out is the owner or manager) had an argument with 2 of the employees and then got in his truck and sped out dropping f bombs at the employees.

When we arrived we were seated at one of the booths since our party consisted of 6 people. I will agree that the place could use a good spruceing up, and perhaps better lighting.   The only real complaint I have is that our bread was hard as a brick, and difficult to chew. Our entrees all came out hot and delciscious. I order the Shrimp Scampi and would definitley recommend it to others. My boyfriend is a big fan of the chicken picatta.   One issue I did have, is that while our both was near the bar, I noticed a lady dressed in jeans and a tank top was seated there, then she was back in the kitchen. Not sure if she was an employee, or one of the owners, but she was helping serve the dishes, and bringing food out from the kitchen which I thought was odd considering she just left her purse at the bar...",

Brandon was so obnoxious and defensive and denied getting the order wrong. Wait, what? Just please take back the pasta with the red sauce and replace with the requested Alfredo sauce. Nope. We were delivered our bill for over $500 and Gary the owner told us to leave or he was calling the police. I was so completely shocked and embarrassed.Please read other reviews.

I respect that this business has been a fixture to old town for 37 years but if you know real momma's italian cooking this place was pretty disappointing.    Service was friendly and attentive, brought sour dough to the table.... Why not Italian bread? I ordered chicken cutlet parm and it was kinda flavorless, the chicken could have been tenderized and seasoned a bit more. My boyfriend ordered the meatballs, because the sign outside said \"greatest meatballs in the world\"... he said \"the sign lied\", we know great balls, we grew up on Italian food we're from New York.... The sauce on my pasta was acidic and overcooked. The one thing that I bitch about is when I get a pasta dish and my plate is FULL of water.  I literally poured it into another plate.  That's just a lazy cook and not acceptable, especially if im paying $50+ for dinner.   Chances are we wouldn't return to Italian Grotto. Lots of other great Italian places in the Valley.",

    "text": "I rarely write reviews when I dine out of town but I wanted to share my experience to inform anyone who might have dietary restrictions.  As an avid traveller, I have eaten in many establishments from mom and pop hole in the wall restaurants to top of the line fine dining from Seattle to California.  This place has the potential to be the place to dine in old Scottsdale with an awesome location and great patio, and old school charm, I have to say that was the main reason we stopped in.  I agree completely with the other reviewers that you should check your bill before paying because the bill is filled in by hand so you really have to know your prices or else you could be paying more than what the menu price is.  Really, a restaurant in the heart of Old Scottsdale should be electronic in 2015.  To start, no host, just an older fellow in street clothes (Jimmy Hendrix golf shirt) wandering the parameter of the patio and inside, and a heavy set gentleman tending to obvious regulars, over zealous as he was, seemed like a nice guy, that is if you were a regular...\"how's you's doin? You's need anyting else?\" as I overheard.  Our waiter was nice enough, older guy who was just ok, but felt that he kept trying to up-sell us on booze and on bread...I'm off carbs but my husband gave in and we agreed. We specifically asked that there be no pork in any of the dishes, and was assured that won't be an issue.  Starter salad was way overdressed and was basically bagged lettuce mix with one slice of cucumber. Hello tomatoes? Onions? Olives? Anyone? Fail.  I tried the tomato cheese bread, because it looked really good and who doesn't love gooey, melty cheese? It was good but definitely not worth the $8 price tag for 4 small pieces, sauce was really acidic and the tomatoes on the bread were obviously canned.   The entrees all arrived with a pasta, while there was a veg option, we were never offered this and was told after the fact that I should have asked for it. Luckily my sons dish came with little chunks of bacon so he ended up eating the side of pasta that came with my dish ( it was not mentioned anywhere in the description but we made sure to mention it when ordering the spaghetti and meat sauce for my other son, that there is not not be any pork in any of the dishes.) I ordered the steak of the day which was supposed to be a ribeye (it was not...and it was way over done) no sides with the steak just a slab of meat swimming in a butter lemon sauce.   The waiter was nice enough to offer to make another dish for my kid without the bacon but seemed upset, when we pointed out the obvious mistake.  Then we noticed big meat chunks in the spaghetti in my other kids dish and he assured us that it was not pork...I wasn't buying it because it was very white in color and at this point I cut it open in front of him and showed him the color- said he was sure that they only use beef.  I just had to take his word for it and accept this entire dining experience as an expensive lesson learned.    Bill was just under $100 with no drinks/booze, one app and 3 dishes...I later realized that $5 was tacked on to cover my sons starter salad even though he couldn't eat his meal because of the bacon- it's not a big deal but felt that was really tacky when it was obviously their mistake.  Getting nickel and dimed and skepticism for what really was in our food is enough for me to not go back,",

It is expensive and the food is bad at best.  4) The staff is pathetic.  5) The owner is a nutcase.  6) the only reason this place stays in business is because of the spring training baseball crowd and if they would not be so stupid and drunk they would also hate this place.  7) They claim to have been at the same spot for longer then ESPN has been in business and while that is True that does not makeup for the bad staff, bad expensive food and the owner's attitude.  I hope everyone reads yelp reviews on this place and makes up their mind to NOT GO. Save your money and respect for any place better.  Sorry Grotto but its time to close up and go away.",

The last 2 times we've eaten there, the food quality was awful and the owner was rude and snippy. When I walked in the last time the owner literally said \"what do you want\". I told him we had a reservation which he was less ham enthusiastic about. I waited at the bar for the rest of my party where I paid $9 for well vodka! Then when my party got there and wanted to sit outside he made rude comments to them. We should have left at this point. My meal was scallop pasta, the scallops were so over cooked they tasted fried and there was a small amount of noodles swimming in a bland creamy sauce ($26). My brother had ravioli, came as 4 small ravioli that he said tasted like the frozen ones he makes at home. Tiny portion and he was still starving ($15). I gave them another chance after the last bad meal but this was too much! I hope they go out of business soon so something decent can take its place.",

Not only did he break every rule of serving etiquette, but he seemed to go out of his way to be disrespectful. He couldn't be bothered to give us a wine list, instead telling my cousin which wine she would want. (Which was dreadful). When I ask what he had that was very dry, he told me I'd like the Pinot Grigio because it was \"really dry and sweet\". I'm certain those two things are opposite. I did not try to correct him. I asked for the salad with dressing on the side. It came on the salad. I again did not say anything. I ordered the same dish as an other person at the table only mine was extra spicy. When I asked if mine was the spicy one, given his earlier mistake, I was admonished with \"well that's what you ordered isn't it?\". The general rudeness continued in every interaction with him until it culminated when I asked where the bathroom was. He just said \"in the back\". I asked for clarification and that's when he very condescendingly said \"oh let me lead you\". As I walked away he said, loud enough for the whole table to hear, that I was \"pretentious\".   I have never not left a tip, and was still planning on giving him the standard 20% until I heard he had said this. I left no tip, but a note recommending that he not speak poorly of patrons within ear shot of their companions. He chased me out of the restaurant, screaming at me down the side walk.  The service was so poor that even if the food had been amazing I would still give this place 1 star, but the food was mediocre at best.  Salad: just lettuce and onions Calamari: decent Garlic bread: flavorless (how is that possible?) Shrimp far diavlo: shrimp was overlooked and tough All in all, don't waste your time.",

It was late and I didn't want to deal with going somewhere else so I dealt with it.   Next I took my son to use the restroom and was absolutely disgusted by how filthy the kitchen, bathroom and rear dining areas were.  There was food and garbage all over the floor it looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months.   I tried to convince my wife to leave, but at that point we had ordered already and she asked that we just \"deal with it\".   We did and when the food arrived, I asked the server for some plain butter for my son's pasta. His response \"we don't have any plain butter. Just the boursin that's already on the table.\"    I've worked in restaurants my entire adult life and have never come across one that didn't have plain butter (in fact I'd wager to say it's impossible).  To top it off the food was bland and clearly not fresh.   Bottom line is that if you're going to be rude to your patrons, you sure as heck better serve better Italian food than an Olive Garden!",

I was in town on March 13, 2015 for spring training with some friends and it was a Saturday night. Every restaurant was busy so I stopped into this place to ask if they had any availability. I was talking to a nice young woman when a greasy haired man with erratic behavior (who I discovered later was the owner, Gary) interrupted and said \"No, there's nothing.\" I asked if he could recommend any other place. He answered, \"You won't get in anywhere, I recommend nothing. Everything is full.\" Perturbed at this odd response, I said, \"So are you saying we should leave Scottsdale?\" Gary suddenly flew into a rage and asked me if I was f---ing with him. He yelled, \"I gave you a good answer and that's what you ask?\" He then stalked off.   Shocked, I asked the young woman who that crazy person was and when she answered, \"my father,\" I felt such pity for her.  She explained that Saturdays are busy and she tried to smooth everything over. I thanked her for being polite and left with my friends. After a few moments, Gary comes outside and proclaims that he wants to \"make amends to whoever he offended\" and that he \"has a table for us right away.\" I told him it was me he offended and when I balked at dining at his restaurant after what happened, Gary stalked away again and gave me the f--- you. You would think that after all these pages and pages of negative reviews about this disturbed man's behavior, that someone would GET A CLUE and GO TO REHAB. Needless to say, stay away from this maniac and his Italian Grotto unless you enjoy being verbally abused.",

    "text": "WARNING!!!!!!!!  PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW BEFORE YOU EAT HERE!!!  Was the single worst dining experience I have EVER had, simply due to the arrogance and attitude of EVERY person working here, from the server who was defensive unnecessarily,  to someone named Brandon aka \"Meatball\", to the host, who wouldn't seat my husband until I came back from using the ladies room?? (Huh?)  We should have immediately left at this point and saved our $90 instead of being ripped off and feeling like they raped us.   Items of note about the experience this evening: 1.  We both ordered seafood fettuccine and it arrived WITHOUT any fettuccine!  It was made up of one shrimp, one scallop, a small chunk of \"fresh fish\" about the size of a golf ball, six mussels (the shells take up a lot of space in the bowl) and calamari which I thought was the fettuccini!!  The Alfredo sauce appeared as a very thin soup in the bowl, again, sans fettuccine!  Price was $28.00, times two, since we both ordered this. When we asked about why the seafood fettuccine came out without any fettuccine, we were told it was because we ordered the vegetable side, which was in place of the fettuccini. So if that weren't insulting enough, when the bill arrived, we were up-charged $5.00 for the side of fettuccine they brought when we initially asked where it was!  OMG!!   2.  Brandon aka Meatball (he told us) was so defensive when our server (quickly and inexplicably) refused to deal with our concerns and went and got him, the last thing he said to us, was advice to \"stiff our server\" on his tip, since he didn't explain things as he should have. Say what!??  That was a first for me, hearing a manager give this directive regarding his employee. It's leadership at its finest, clearly.  3.  Caesar salad was coated in dressing to the extent that I couldn't eat it. And not one crouton was included in this salad. Minestrone soup was mediocre. Had one small pat of butter with the four chunks of bread so had to ask for more butter. And the vegetable side was inedible. $90.00, folks. (This includes $20 for two vodka martinis, BTW.)   Bottom line, these 350 reviews all mostly speak to the same types of issues, which involve poor attitudes, overpriced items for mediocre food, at best, and they are so good by this point of talking over you and immediately going on the defensive, they just flat out do not care whether you are satisfied or not. So lesson learned. When it comes to this joke of a place in Old Scottsdale with the primo location, save your money and ALWAYS, ALWAYS READ THE YELP REVIEWS regardless of where you go to dine. All these people can't be that wrong!!!  TERRIBLE!!",

Salad was out of a bag and the dressing tasted like someone had fun with garlic and red onions.  Really overpowered the salad.  I personally tried the Minestrone and I must say it was horrible!  It looked like the had thrown pieces of pasta in with their marinara sauce, I have never tasted anything like it.  We had one order of Chicken Parmigiana a bit greasy and the sauce tasted like out of a can with a bunch of spices in it.  It was served over rigatoni, well I would say pieces of rigatoni.  It appears the use the left over pieces to put as the sides.  I was the brace one and ordered the Angel Hair Bolognase, oh my I can't begin to explain the taste.  Visually it looked like they had chopped up a meatball the sausage was sold old it was hard.  I sent it back immediately and No I did not order anything to replace it.  The server didn't seem surprised.  He just said OK. I get it when it is Spring Training this place is cool because of their memorabilia but their food is that of a cheap buffet and their prices are that of a nice Italian Restaurant.  Maybe if people would stop going their and they would start caring they would taste their food and get some new Cooks.",

Having been to the Italian Grotto in the past where I've enjoyed the relaxed and welcoming atmosphere surrounded by sounds of Italian accents. She loves the Italian culture, so for all these reasons, we stopped in for a glass of wine. Within moments, the bartender threw down her driver's license, expressing his dismay about \"the Jersey people.\" Not a huge deal; perhaps this is just one of those people with a dry, crass sense of humor. Being from Jersey himself, my daughter-in-law tried to engage him in a friendly conversation about West Orange and East Orange. He interrupted, and negated this with, \"No. The blacks are from....\" The blacks. This all happened within minutes of sitting down, and this exchange made me extremely uncomfortable.

The wait staff did their job at a decent pace and I felt that everything came out accordingly but the food is just not great. I got the artichoke appetizer which was not bad but I have definitely had better, and the linguine and clams. I am almost certain that the clams were not alive and definitely weren't very fresh tasting. They also seemed to have the odd smell and there was barely any flesh to them. I just was not satisfied. The linguine itself was ok. I don't think I can justify paying the amount for the quality of food. They did have a complimentary bread that was very standard. I tried a scallop on one of the other dishes and it was just ok as well. A little overcooked and kind of bland. Overall, the experience was underwhelming and I probably wouldn't come again.",

    "text": "We strongly discourage considering this restaurant.  Comments regarding having a sense of humour to go to this establishment are nonsense.  You go to a restaurant to have good food, good service and a good time.  If you don't want any of these, then I highly recommend the Italian Grotto.  We should have been forewarned when we were looking for a restaurant and walked by, a waiter stopped us and said that the service was bad but the food was good.  Well, he was half right - the service was so bad.  The food was not special. It started off when we all were about to be seated and two of our party went to the restroom (hopefully, the kitchen is in much better shape) and the owner came out and appeared annoyed that they were using the facilities.  We think there was a staff shortage as our \"waiter\" was incompetent even compared against bad waiter standards.  I would advise against trying to make any adjustment to the meal as they appear to be reluctant to accommodate any changes no matter how minor - one friend requested a bake potato and this comes \"only with steak\".  While discussing this, the owner came out with two plates of food for another table and instead of leaving our waiter to take our order, interrupted him to deliver the meal to another table.  Who knows why the owner did not deliver the meals himself is questionable but understandable after he made a point to come to our table later. That caused our waiter to go the other table and then he proceeded to go to another table and cleared their plates leaving us waiting to complete our order.  But eventually he came back and our order was placed.  Upon ordering an appetizer to share, he instructed us to clear the center of the table to make room for the plate.  Really?  The only place for us to move the condiments was to place them on the ground. Salads and soups.  The soup was good.  Salads - no creamy garlic - what Italian restaurant doesn't have that?  They suggested ranch - wonder if the waiter realizes the difference.  The house dressing was ok, a little  vinegary.  Don't get the blue cheese dressing.  Not sure what it really was but didn't taste like any other blue cheese I have tatsed.  Meals came.  Minus the baked potato that had caused such an issue at the start.  Luckily, a real waiter was working that night and we explained what we wanted and he immediately arranged for a baked potato.  I had the Chicken Carolina and might even recommend it had it been warm except that the whole meal was tepid and so disappointing.  The salmon was great.  The manicotti was fair.  The shrimp scampi wasn't as expected.  We probably would have chalked the whole thing to experience, some meals/nights are good, some bad.  Except for the owner.  He is a character unto himself.  The saga of the baked potato continued.  The owner just had to come over and in an aggressive tone tell us that the baked potato only came with the steak - something we already knew.  This was the tipping point.  Any reasonable restauranteur would have either not come by (no real need as this restaurant must rely on passing traffic and he would assume we weren't coming back - True) or would have apologized for the confusion over the baked potato.  But no.  This individual had to make his point over the customer's.  And he would not back down.  To add insult to injury, he sat close to the outside eating area and lit a cigarette.  We visit the Scottsdale area frequently and luckily this particular establishment is an aberration.  We strongly recommend against going here.",

The service was great, despite it being very busy. Our server's name was Tony Graziano. He was personable and funny and made a menu suggestion (the chicken picatta) that was absolutely amazing. The white wine I ordered was nice, but it would have been nice to see a more extensive Italian wine selection. We definitely want to check this place out again, and have both agreed to come back during the holidays.",

    "text": "Love their food; True NY style Italian (ie Southern Italian). Having grown up on the East Coast, I avoid all chain Italian places, and love little shops like this one.  My recommendation: lasagna. It's great. Their red sauce is delicious, and I'm a big fan of anything made with it. I'm sure their other food is yummy too, but I haven't had the whole menu since I don't live in AZ.  Dessert looks good, but I haven't tried much of it yet. I've only had the cannoli & I enjoyed it.   Their furnishings are a bit older, and their restaurant is about the same size as many of the other mom-and-pop places in Old Scottsdale. It's furnished on the darker side, just like most old fashioned Italian restaurants or steakhouses.  It's great for afternoon lunch (and doesn't get super busy like some of the other \"fad\" places in Old Scottsdale--so no wait!).  At dinner time, they do get busy. They have outdoor seating for when it cools off at night. It's a cute place for a date, or there's a small bar where you can eat a casual meal if you're on your own.   Their daytime/weekend bartender is great. He's been there a long time, great conversation & super friendly. Also, he's very attentive :). The evening bartender isn't ideal, but does his job. He's on the young side for me (in other words seems to find his phone more interesting than even brief conversations with his customers).  Many of the lower star reviews I see here seem to be kids looking for new, shiny, etc.  Just because something is new doesn't make it good, and some places that stick around for a long time do so because they're worth it. This is one of those places!",

Some of the entrees were really great and others I found to be a bit too salty, though still quite good.  The desserts were excellent.  Price is just a little high compared to places with similar food that aren't in Scottsdale, but we know we'll pay a penalty for eating in that city so it's expected.  They had excellent bread with a spiced-up butter, but I like to also have bread with olive oil.  Unfortunately the oil provided on the table was either bad or it was one of those mixes where they use vegetable oil to cheapen it.  Either way, the oil simply tasted awful.  Overall I'd go again when I'm in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way to get there.",

The waitstaff was extremely rude and standoff-ish.  Our server gave us one minute to decide after he gave us the menus and then started being condescending because we were still reading through the choices.  Maybe he had somewhere more important to be? The salads came warm, the pasta came cold, and the water/napkins were never reloaded.   There are several good Italian options in Scottsdale and this one's not worth another look. I don't post many reviews, but I would be doing a huge disservice to the Yelp community if I let this experience pass. This place must stay open because of its location because it has nothing else going for it. I wouldn't give this place another hard earned dime!  Pros -- Location Cons -- Ugh, where do I start?

My wife is in the hospital here and we took a much deserved break for lunch.  We talked to the waiter and thought we had a good rapport with him.  He and the chef who came out were very nice to us .   He said that all of the pasta dishes were  $8 for lunch and would we like soup or salad.   Also when two of us ordered a glass of wine he recommended one and brought the bottle so we could have a sample.  In the end we ended up getting charged for the whole bottle of wine and extra for soup and salad.  What should have been a reasonable meal ended up costing over  $150!

The flavor was very strong and not good at all. They seated us at a table that had crumbs all over the table cloth, obviously not cleaned up since the previous customers. The atmosphere was dark and dank. The music they played was 60's which is fine but in an Italian restaurant I would think they would play something better suited. The decor was awful. Overall, I'd say the place was a dump and the food was not good. Especially not worth the price. The only real plus was that our waitress was attentive.

To start the waiter was terrible.  Then I get my meal and it is terrible.  I ordered chicken piccata and the chicken was like rubber.  To make it worse the owner comes over to our table chewing food while explaining the reason was because the chicken had a stroke and that is why it was tough.  They proceed to take my meal and as it ends up they gave me the same chicken back.  When questioned the owner lied and said it was a whole new plate.  When I called him on it he got mad.  What he didn't realize is I had cut one of the chicken breasts in half and took one bite off to it.  When it was served the first time it was two chicken breasts now he is bringing the dish back and here is the same pieces of chicken.  Once breast cut in two with a piece missing and a small breast.  NOT A COINCIDENCE.  He didn't think I would notice.  I ate the small breast and told him that was delicious but the other one was like rubber.  He didn't want to give me any discount and when I went to pay he finally said he would take $10 off.  I was upset by the way he was speaking to me so I told him I wasn't happy. When he rang up my bill he charged me the full $30 for the bill and said he hoped that would make me happy.  He should not be working with the public. He has no manners and no business sense.  He lost two customers ( and I hope a lot more after this review).  I gave this restaurant a chance but I hope no one else does.  It was a terrible experience. I would not even give this any stars.  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.  HORRIBLE!",

I'm not going to comment on prices since it's kind of telling with the location and all, but it's not a place I would afford to go to often.  The place houses a prominent bar, which was where all the people were at. We were early, the only ones sitting at a table. The windows were open which let in a lot of light, which was nice because the decor is 95% black.   When the complementary bread came out, the bread and butter was cold. The butter seemed like it just thawed from being in a freezer. Cold bread is never, ever appetizing. This was incredibly disappointing because I have had GREAT breads at franchised restaurants, even.   We had two appetizers: calamari and fried zucchini. The calamari was OK. The breading was so light it was almost unnoticeable. I did like how fresh the squid tasted. The zucchini was like getting a plate of sauteed zucchini. Breading was falling off and it looked extremely soggy. Also, we noticed the plate looked full because of fried battered pieces, not zucchini.  My boyfriend ordered the bass, oreganata (sp?) style, which was under pasta in a lemon butter sauce. His dish looked good but he couldn't finish it because it was a bit greasy and heavy for him.   I had the cannelloni florentine, which was supposed to have veal and chicken inside it. The crepes were good (lol). The mixture inside looked like shredded, overprocessed.. something. The meat had a creamy texture, which is just weird. It was overloaded with cheese and cream sauce. I didn't enjoy it.   Also, despite it being not busy, our waiter was rushed with us. Not sure why. When it started to get more crowded, he spent more time with people. Don't know if it was us or he decided to step up bc there were more people.   Overall I might try something that doesn't have a lot of cheese but I don't think I could persuade my bf to come back. I'm not that eager to, either.  I rated this based on what the rating caption said. The whole experience was just \"meh\".",

Don't go here unless your a fan of having to inspect your food to make sure it hasn't gone rotten! The blond female manager also was terrible and had horrible customer service!",

    "text": "I'm still trying to wrap my brain around what happened at this place on the night of our visit. I'm numbering the important issues because they are so crazy, no one will believe this horrible experience!!!! 1. We had a party of 10 on our business trip, men women, white, non whites. Stopped at the host stand and  2. was rudely scolded by the woman for not making a reservation on a Thurs of spring training.  Being sympathetic to her busy situation, I said it was our fault and we would go somewhere else.. She stopped me and said, no hang on. At this time a man (the owner) seemed very high strung told us if we wait about an hour, he would have a table. (he only saw me, not the others in our party, they were outside waiting)   So we waited, some of us inside and some of us outside. After over an hour, I told the owner we understood his situation that he couldn't make people leave so we would go somewhere else.  3. He said NO he was going to \"kick these old people out because they were late getting there\" YES HE SAID THAT The hostess came over and asked if we wanted to sit outside and we said Yes of course, at that time the 4.  owner stopped her and said NO NO NO   It was very uncomfortable but then he sat us at another table.  The server arrived and began to ask for our drink orders. I asked for separate checks and he said  5. We do not have separate checks. So I said ok, we can figure it out no problem....  During his delivery of the specials, one of my (non white) guests asked how the swordfish was... at which time the server, put his hand up, said AND I QUOTE 6. \"DO NOT INTERUPT ME WHEN I\"M SPEAKING\" All of us were in such disbelief, I kept waiting to see if there was a punch line. Unfortunately, he was dead serious!! Needless to say, I spoke up and told him he should NEVER speak to ANYONE in that manner let a lone a guest of the restaurant. He tried to say it was because he was extremely busy. yayayayayaya blahahaha At which I requested an apology, He looked at ME and apologized, and I informed him to apologize to the gentleman. He did it very reluctantly .   We SHOULD HAVE walked out at that point but we were so hungry we decided to just wait it out for our food.  Food was good... I will say that.  Next the check came. It was so OLD SCHOOL with  7. nothing printed, only hand written out but ONLY the prices. We couldn't figure out what we were being charged for so we couldn't separate any of the bill. One of our guest tried to stop the server to request, at least a menu, if not something to explain the charges but he tried to avoid us by moving rapidly around the table.  My guest stopped the owner, this is where is went REALLY bad,  8. The owner began raising his voice and telling my guest, \"I'm not your damn waiter, ask him\" 9. my guest stood up and told the owner to calm down at which time the owner was yelling so hard, he was spitting on the neck of my guest!!! We were so shocked, I wanted out of there so I picked up the check and paid for it. It was about to go REALLY bad really fast,  Before I signed, I asked the waiter 10. , \"did you add gratuity?\" at which time he informed me he had tipped himself.    I have managed restaurants for more years than that server has been alive, and I am shocked by what we experienced!!. Here is the piece de resistance....  We walked down the street to a nice bar. I asked one of the staff what was up with Italian grotto, he response was 11.  \"ya, everyone knows they are racist, Its because you had those 2 guys with you\", at this time he pointed to my \"NON white\" employees.  IN MY OPINON  This appeared to be  a. why he didn't want us sitting on the patio outside where we could be seen and b. why it took so long for us to get sat and  c. why the waiter was so rude to my non white friend.  d. Clearly the owner wanted us out and never come back I am from the south and I have never been treated so badly and so volatile. After reading all of these YELP comments This has confirmed my feelings about this place. To add further to it. I was told  12. this is \"the place to go, for MLB scouts\" I would hope the MLB wouldn't support this kind of behavior!!!   I highly suggest people think before they enter this place.  I'm sure due to the high volume of tourist in this area, they will still be around, however, if I can keep one person from going there, then that is what I hope will happen. Shocked and discussed!",

The fried calamari came out and it was okay, but nothing worth writing home about.   My fiance ordered the sausage and peppers and I ordered the Seafood Alfredo. He said the sausage and peppers was okay, but maybe would have been better with pasta, but instead felt like he got a $5.00 sausage cut up with a splash of sauce.   I ordered the seafood alfredo and it was lack luster. The Alfredo was meh, and the seafood was dirty. While eating the pasta, I also chewed through a mouthful of sand. For $28, I would have rather saved the money for the dish and gone to Olive Garden for $10.   The atmosphere was pretty, and the wait staff okay, but I would tell anyone to save their money and go to Olive Garden because it'll be a fraction of the price and ten times the flavor.",

    "text": "I write this with a heavy heart as I do wish this establishment the best.  I used to come here more often 2-3 years ago and I noticed a significant decline on my recent trip.  My favorite dish was the seafood diablo or maybe it's just the seafood pasta in the marinara sauce.  I don't think it's a standard dish on the seafood anymore and not only that, the waiter doesn't ask how spicy i would like it.  I used to pick the highest level since I like the way my mouth tingles and burns with the exploding flavor.  This time I went for the cannelloni as I search from west to east coast for the best cannelloni.  So far, the village in Chicago is still the reigning champion. Sadly, Grotto didn't even make the honorable mention cut.  My friends did order the fettuccini  Alfredo and they said it was good.  The marinara sauce is still yummy.  Please bring it back the quality to what it once was so I can come back to my favorite Italian joint in Scottsdale.",

I go to Scottsdale once a year and have always peered in and wanted to go there.. So we did!! The service was slow at first, but then once they started to take care of us it was like we were a regular.. Very kinda old school italian(with a flair of a sports bar) we felt like you were in NY.. A must try is the Caprese Salad it was really yummy!!!",

If you dont like waiitng for a table i suggest u go in the summer when the city is dead.  I live here year round and no restaurant in march seats u immediatly,  the town is crazy with all the spring traing fans.  IF you dont like crowds stay home and let the people with good taste enjoy the wonderfull atmosphere the Italian Grotto provides.",

    "text": "In Short: Great seafood, but a bit pricey.  Above average for Italian and seafood.  I've been here several times and I'll keep going back for their food for a while more.  It's located in old town, pretty conveniently on Scottsdale rd.  You probably have to park on the street but not a big deal.  The decor and atmosphere is set to be cozy, pretty much everything is done in either black or white.  I find it a bit pretentious but it is quite cozy, so I'll forgive them for that.  On some tables, lighting is very poor, you may have a hard time seeing your food, and the tables are a bit cramped as well.    The staff is pretty knowledgeable about their menu and the service is pretty nice.  I love their specials, typically seafood items.  First page of the menu is appetizers and pasta items, second page is veal and other meats and the third page is seafood, and that's it, simple and great.  You can try some of their appetizers but they do provide delicious bread with a pretty good herb butter.  Save some of the bread for your entree to dip into their delicious sauces.  I usually go for their veal or one of the seafood dishes.  They are all pretty good, can't go too wrong with anything, but I would stay away from the thick marinara sauce.   It's a bit overpowering for delicate seafood.  Sea bass with spinach ravioli were awesome, it's topped off with a buttery pomodoro sauce.  Another good item is the scallops, you can have it scampi style or prepared it 6 other different ways.  Veal piccata is so good, so is the veal marsala,they make it really tender.  I have experienced over cooking on some of the more tender and flaky white fish, it wasn't inedible but it could have been better.  The place is a bit pricey, but then again what seafood place isn't.  Most dishes are between 25-30 but there are alot of pasta dishes around 10-20 as well.  An adequate wine and beer list accompanies your food as well, but as usually they reflect \"scottsdale\" pricing.",

    "text": "When we arrived, we ordered a beer each and some calamari to hold us over until the Cal game started. The gal behind the bar was somewhat \"rude\" to begin with (maybe she had a bad day?). We then ordered salad and pasta for dinner with wine. She was \"perturbed\" that we were planning to share the order rather than order an entree each. The game finally started and fans for both teams were rooting/screaming as usual and the owner came over to me and told me I was \"too loud\"---even though everyone else was cheering all the same. We even bought a beer for the guy sitting next to us (who was betting on Louisville). She wrote up our bill even though we weren't finished with the meal (nor possible ordering of dessert, etc.) and told us to leave. When we asked her why she said we had been there long enough. (???) She even threatened to black out all of the TV's (there were about half a dozen). We were absolutely dumbfounded. This is the kicker: we have frequented The Grotto for the past 4 years during spring training, tip well, and considered ourselves \"regulars\" (we became acquainted with everyone that worked there including the owner) but this gal behind the bar was new to us. Who knows the real reason--we are still scratching our heads! However, we will no longer patronize such rude service.  As 4 year patrons, we are no longer supporting their establishment.   We've been discovering how Scottsdale has been booming with new eateries----from excellent sports bars with great food, service , wine menu and draft beer selections to nice linen tablecloth dining experiences.  We certainly don't need to be insulted by those at The ?Grotto anymore.",

We were in Scottsdale for 4 days and this is definitely the best food that I had while we were there.  It feels like a NY Italian restaurant...dimly lit, dark-colored booths, sinatra in the background, and some NY-style servers.  I had the halibut and it was excellent.  My husband really enjoyed his lasagna as well.  We also had the tiramisu and the cannoli.  Both were very good, however I think the tiramisu was the best.  Our server was very friendly and very attentive.  They really take care of their customers and want to make sure that you have a good time.  If you're looking for a place to have some great food and to have an overall fun experience, check this place out.

The other waiter was too busy text messaging to someone sitting at the bar.  Over all the service was TERRIBLE and the food was bad too.  The bread was dry and the sauce was like it came from a can.  The pasta was obviously pre-made as it was chewy.  I obviously was an inconvenience to them as they spent more time reading their paper and the woman bartender (who was probably also the owner) was too busy talking about getting a birthday cake for someone instead of paying attention to customers.

I have brought many family members here and not one has been disappointed.  Gary (the owner) is the Mark Cuban of the restaurant business.  He personally will check on every table to make sure that everything is going perfect (trust me, it is), and offers service and food that can only live up to his high standards.  The food is just amazing.  I have been there on numerous occasions and have yet to order anything but the Chicken Fontina. This dish includes a generous helping of chicken in a sweeter wine sauce that is perfectly countered with the saltiness of prosciutto.  I did try some of my dad's Manicotti last time and I have to say, the meat sauce is awesome.  One of the best meat sauces I have tasted from any Italian restaurant.  I have to say that the Italian Grotto is one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona, and a place where I can feel like I am part of the family thanks to Gary.",

I get the impression that Meatball as well as the restaurant's owner are transplanted goombahs from Brooklyn, where this place would probably fit right in if it weren't for the faux southwest-style exterior. Several reviewers have complained about the service, but for us, (catching on to Meatball's, \"You talkin' to me?\" schtick right away) it was fine, even fun. The food was plentiful and tasty. I had the manicotti (\"manigot\" in Meatball's Brooklynese) and it was quite good, even if the marinara was just a tad watery. My wife had the chicken Ceasar salad. As mentioned in at least one previous review, it was drenched in dressing, but neither she nor I found that to be disagreeable. The beer selection could be better, but it also could be much worse. It is an Italian place, after all.   I found it amusing that this place sort of masquerades as a higher-end establishment with cloth tablecolthes and napkins, when in realty it is more akin to a pizza joint/sports bar. Old Town Scottsdale is as schlocky and touristy as a place gets and the Italian Grotto is there to serve the tourist trade. But we enjoyed our lunch there.",

    "text": "3 stars.  TL;DR: pros for good Italian fare, friendly ambiance; cons for selling too hard, and check your bill for miscalculations.  Meal: 4 stars - (appetizers) Caesar salad; fried calamari - (entree) scallop oreganata - (daily special) Chilean sea bass  Ambiance and service: 3.5 stars - funny, smooth-talking waiter - sports bar: dim but friendly, buzzing with chatter; lots of bobble heads  Bill miscalculation: 1 stars  Came here with my family late on a weekday evening. I wasn't hungry, so I ordered an appetizer salad ($8). Waiter asked if I wanted to add grilled chicken -- I figured it was $2 or $3 more, so I said yes. Waiter offered garlic bread, to which we declined, but he said he would \"throw it in anyway.\"  The food came in good time and was a solid, Italian meal. Chilean sea bass was tender -- delicious! Fried calamari is fried calamari, but very good. The good-humored waiter came by often to check on us, cracking jokes and whisking away plates.  When the bill came, we noticed a $30+ overcharge! - My $8 Caesar salad turned into a $20 entree: the waiter said \"All our chicken orders are $20.\" A fair waiter should have notified me if adding grilled chicken on a salad is more than a couple of dollars -- especially if there is no \"grilled chicken Caesar salad\" entree on the menu. - The garlic bread that was \"thrown in anyway\" was suddenly an extra $6. - Even given these prices, the total was an additional $17 over -- a pure miscalculation.  We notified the waiter and had everything fixed (except for the salad... oh well). Overall, it was $30/person with the correction -- on the pricey side. Ended on a sour note, but had good portions and friendly staff... I would return, but with a greater wariness for the bill.",

My friend and I had the Spinach ravioli with pomodoro sauce, which was recommended by the waiter.  It was just okay.  Our third friend had the eggplant and mushroom parmagiana with marinara sauce.  I liked her marinara better than my pomodoro.  The entrees came with a soup or salad.  I had the minestrone, which was really delicious, fresh, and not over seasoned.  My friends had at the salad which was also very tasty, especially with their house dressing.  Because they had run out of bread, the waiter comped us an order of garlic bread, which was drenched in butter, they way we liked it!    The prices were quite high I thought for pasta, but it is a touristy and trendy area.    Well, without this experience, this place would just be another place to eat.  The owner of the restaurant came over to us, said he had heard our conversation all about the SF Giants, the reason we were in town, and suggested we go to the bar to talk to some gentlemen.   I looked over and thought, what the heck is he talking about?   He then brought us over to the bar and introduced us to the father of a Cy Young award winning pitcher...won't mention names...and The Beat writer of the SF Giants.  So...if you are a baseball fan...it's not a bad idea to visit this place!!",

    "text": "Went back to Grotto for the first time in many years.  I was a fan then, I still am.  The restaurant is loud.  It's crowded.  And the food is good.  We started with mussels portifino (a white wine and garlic broth).  I liked that the dish was available in two sizes, the small being perfect for an app for two.  A little more bread to soak up the broth would have been nice, though.  I also had a special of sea bass over ravioli topped with marinara.  I liked all the components except I never seem to learn I'm not so big on seafood with marinara.  The sea bass was a generous portion, and cooked perfectly, as was the ravioli.  I had a little bit of plate envy over my husband's halibut with a lemon butter sauce.  I had this dish the last time and loved it!  Service was average.  Our waiter was relatively attentive, but not really friendly.  He oddly never made eye contact (not sure if he was always looking at something/someone else or just weird) and he rattled off the specials way too quickly.   Certainly not bad enough to deter me from going again.  But someone remind me not to order seafood in red sauce!",

Italian Grotto was dark and crowded...it must be good.  The restaurant had a great garlic smell to it...I know why. It's the delicious garlic toast! The garlic toast had real diced chunks of garlic on top of the grilled bread! SO freaking awesome.  The Caesar salad was also the bomb because they add in anchovies...yum!   Our server was great too...bubbly and energetic.   What I didn't like too much about this place is the lack of pasta options. It was mainly ravioli, cannelloni, and lasagna.",

    "text": "Last night 6 of my girlfriends and I had dinner here. We had made reservations and were seated promptly. We were however seated next to the door and one of my girlfriends was shoved a few times by other customers because of it. We all shrugged it off and tried to enjoy our night.  First off the 2 stars are for the food. The food was pretty amazing. I had the Chilean sea bass and it was divine. It was served on top of freshly made ravioli and it was incredible. Everyone else had very positive things to say about their dinner. For dessert we all shared 3 cannolis which tasted heavenly. So delicious.  Here is where it takes a turn for the worse...  Our bill arrived and we know that they don't do separate checks. Understandable. We were told we could split it up with our cards as long as we told them how much to charge. Fast forward 2 minutes...as I'm simply writing down how much to charge on each card, a older looking balding man approaches our table and starts mumbling about needing our table and that we have been taking too long. Are you kidding me? From start to end we were there a MAXIMUM of 1 hour, a party of 7 mind you! He then proceeds to come back and again states that we are taking forever with the cards and what is it going to take to get us out of there. I understand that it's a Saturday night, but the manner in which he addressed us was completely unacceptable and unprofessional. It was flat out rude and demeaning.   At first I thought maybe he was just having a bad night and whatnot but after reading other reviews I know that is just his \"wonderful\" personality. I would love to come back for the food but am not going to support a business that is spearheaded by such a jerk.",

We were planning a dinner out so asked for lunch sized portions.  $ off if you order from here to here on the menu, smaller.  Ok, I have the angel hair bolognese.  The owner rather than telling me they do not do that as a lunch he said spaghetti with meat sauce.  I guess it could be called that so said yes.  It went down from there.  There was anther altercation with a young lady about a $100 gift certificate.  You can't use that here, she left her meal that was just served. The manager/owner then said she was drunk to other customers.  Seemed perfectly good to me and explained the place had changed hands recently to my wife, before she left.  This kind of thing seems typical from other comments below.  There are too many fine places to go without being subjected to nonsense at a meal.",

    "text": "If you look at my two other Yelp reviews, you will see positive reviews of a couple of restaurants I've been to. Normally, if a restaurant is lame, which is rare, I won't even review it. But I am going to enjoy eviscerating this truly repulsive restaurant, not for the food, which was somewhat edible, but for the dishonest pricing and for the jerk who apparently owns the place.  My girlfriend Carol and I were walking through Scottsdale. It was just past noon on a recent Sunday so we were thinking about lunch. We passed Italian Grotto and saw a menu posted outside on the wall. The \"lunch\" part of the menu had most entrees at $8. \"I'll treat you to lunch,\" she said. \"Sounds good,\" said I.  We went in and there were very few customers. Three or four people were sitting at the bar. We were seated quickly. The server, who was polite, brought us menus. The first thing we noticed was that there were no $8 items on it. All of the lunch items were priced at $13 or more. So we asked the server about the menu on the outside of the building. Here's what he said: \"Yes, those are $8 items if you get them al la carte.\" Of course, al la carte suggests that you can get, say, the baked ravioli for $8 if you get nothing else on the side. But then the server added \"But these items do come with either soup or salad.\" Hmmm? It clearly sounded like he was saying the lunch special was $8 and you still got a soup or salad. Carol and I looked at each other and shrugged our shoulders. I ordered the baked ravioli, she ordered a vegetable pasta dish.(Each of these were $8 on the outside menu but $13 on the menu he handed us. He clearly intimated that we were ordering items as a \"lunch special\".) We also ordered  a side of garlic bread and one iced tea. That's all we ordered.  As we awaited our meals, there was some person standing around the lobby and I heard him say something loudly about \"Jews\", which got my attention. He seemed drunk and a couple of the servers were standing around him so I thought \"some idiot\"...and tuned him out. (And remember, this was just after noon!)   The food arrived and was fine. I got exactly four medium-sized ravioli on my plate, along with a salad. The drunk guy was quiet but still standing around the lobby like he owned the place. He looked a bit like Donald Trump, same age and attitude, and he wore a couple of rather large gold earrings in his left ear. As it turned out, this inebriated jerk WAS the owner!   After we ate, we got the check and were shocked to see that it totaled $40. Not only that, but the entrees were written down as $14 each. What kind of weird mistake was this? Carol, who doesn't mind confronting issues like this, had me wait at the table while she went to find the waiter.Then I heard the loud-mouthed owner yapping at her. I did not hear what he was saying but it sounded, at a distance, like he was arguing with her. As my attention turned to him, my girlfriend laughed a couple of times and I thought it must be alright. (Carol is from Long Island and is used to New York attitudes so I figured all was good.) This one-sided conversation lasted 5 minutes or so. Then she came back with the bill and rolled her eyes saying \"Let's get outta here.\"  As it turned out, the owner only deducted that extra two dollars from the bill (from $14 to $13 per entree) and, according to Carol, he reeked of alcohol and acted drunk. And obnoxious. He asked her to \"Get a load of the queers at the bar!\" And that was just the beginning of his tirade.  She said that the owner wondered why I, the boyfriend, wasn't paying the bill and that \"no woman should pay when a man can pay. I have six daughters and if they ever had to pay for a meal on a date, the boyfriends would never be welcome in the house!\" Carol, thinking that the guy was just trying to act like a macho New Yorker, told him that she was from Long Island. In response he said \"Long Island isn't New York! Only spoiled brats live on Long Island. I grew up in Manhattan, in Chelsea, on 29th and 9th!\"   He asked Carol why we were in Scottsdale. She said, \"We live in Tucson and have been visiting Arcosanti.\" He said \"Why would you live in Tucson? It's a dump! I had a bagel business on 1st Ave. in Tucson and it was a terrible place!\" He also added, \"I was at Arcosanti a few years ago and it was dirty and hippies lived there.\" I suppose this was the point in the conversation when Carol laughed and walked away.  As we were walking back to our car and Carol was relating this story, we knew that this information needs to get out. And seeing what many others have written about this restaurant, I think you can see we aren't exaggerating.   The drunken owner of Italian Grotto is a misanthrope named Gary Horowitz (so why his comment about Jews?!) and no one should be supporting his business.  also see: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.phoenixnewtimes.com%2F2001-05-03%2Frestaurants%2Fveni-vici-vendetta%2Ffull%2F&s=ff1a4c6982be8b769c33dd78e7d0fb46f9be6006b7fbb28918e90bb73ce0a5ee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">phoenixnewtimes.com/2001...</a>",

    "text": "My husband and I stumbled upon this place after driving in from Orange County. We decided to spend the night in Scottsdale and check out the downtown.  We immediately loved the decor and definitely had a local feel. We were seated at the perfect table which was right in front of one of the windows and next to the bar! And after the long drive we were looking for cocktails! I had a Kettle One dirty martini which was perfecto and my hubby enjoyed a margatini - both hit the spot. To start out with we ordered the mussels with the Rapallo sauce which was delicious and a nice sauce to also dip our bread in - heaven! Next I enjoyed their house salad which was fresh with a light dressing while my husband enjoyed their minestrone soup. It was truly one of the best soup's we have had.   Then we ordered a nice bottle of Barbera that went perfect with my Grande Lasagna which was fantastico! I never order Lasagna but had a craving for a heavy pasta and it was right on spot. The several different cheeses, meats and sauce did a happy dance in my mouth. It was perfectly baked not dry or overdone. Meat sauce then ground meat and Italian sausage layered with two cheeses - ricotta and mozzarella! This was not a noncaloric meal something that Paula Dean or the Barefoot Contessa would approve of! My husband had the Veal Carolina and he said it was great - I will take his word for it as I do not like veal.  Since we were full and \"stuffed like a tic\" as they say in the south we forgo dessert although it was very tempting. We enjoyed our experience here tremendously the food was great and the service was very attentive. If we stumble back in Scottsdale we will be sure to return and hopefully enjoy a dessert next time.",

I liked the music (Sinatra and Jazz divas) as well as the food. This time of year in AZ is great, as the climate enables outdoor seating; the French doors were opened and the inside became the outside.  The black leather booths are great for small groups and the lighting will do its part to make you feel comfortable. Food was creative for American Italian: The Carolina chicken (chicken with melted cheese, penne, prosciuto and a light olive oil garlic sauce) is strongly recommended. If you just like to hang out for the bar, I am sure you will like this place as well... great selection and super friendly staff!",

He was a pretty funny guy and I knew from the reviews to expect a little bit of sass.  We got plenty of that, but he also had some really helpful suggestions regarding the menu.  Some of the other reviews were pretty spot on about this place, especially the one about them turning their salads into soup.  You better like a little bit of salad with your dressing!  I'm kind of curious how much attitude you'd get if you asked for it on the side.  In any case, it wasn't really a big deal because I liked their house dressing.  As far as entrees, my friends both ordered chicken dishes and I had the mussels portofino.  My dish was excellent, heavy on the garlic, just the way I like it.  I'd come back again if I lived in the area.",

Now, you have to understand something about this place... it is not a chain and so things aren't run the same systematic way.  Yes, the owner drinks on occasion and is the host... so sometimes you will wait 45 minutes with a reservation.  As you can see, my star rating is still a 5.  Make friends with these guys and trust their opinions and you will be family!  I take my other family there for EVERY major event (birthdays, graduation.. etc).

We asked at the front if it was OK to just get coffee and dessert and the guy looked around and gave us a \"yeah, whatever\" sort of statement and pointed us to the patio. The coffee was old and burned... tarry. The tiramisu was probably the worst tiramisu I've ever had. Then we got the bill for $26??? Our fault for not looking at the menu. But what a rip off. It is one thing to pay upwards of 13$ for a coffee and dessert that tastes good at a nice restaurant. But definitely not worth it for old coffee and stale probably store bought tiramisu.",

    "text": "Tonight was my first night checking out the Grotto, and after a bad service experience with another place close by, i was ready to eat anywhere at that point.   I have passed the Grotto many times living in Scottsdale, and have often walked by smelling the aromas grazing my senses while strolling by...i love that they seem to always have their doors/windows open and the tables overlooking the street are fantastic.    Anyway, as Brett S. said , the service can be a little bad but it is definitely part of the charm.  Anyone who has every been to a real Italian \"joint\" understands this.  I was almost pleased with how traditional the feeling was, as in \"if you don't like it, get the heck out\" haha. It was also a very packed Friday night around 730, so i truly expected nothing but a wait anywhere we went, but we at least found a group of down to earth people entering and exiting wearing everything from jeans and a t-shirt like me, golf attire, to going out clothes. No matter your style, they treated you all the same.  Perfect!  (finding a place like that in Scottsdale is hard to do!)  With it being a Friday night and already having a bad experience with a previous place, i just wanted a square meal and to head home, so i didn't do as much sampling as i would have liked.  We started out with the calamari which came with a marinara sauce with a little kick to it.  It looks like they added red pepper flakes at the end, but it was a nice touch.  I had the house salad with vinaigrette dressing...and word to the wise, if you don't like onions, this salad (at least with the vinaigrette) comes with sneaky chopped marinated red onions in it...so beware! The blue cheese crumbles were a nice touch as well.  My friend ended up ordering the fettuccine alfredo and i chose the cannelloni. The fettuccine was much smaller portioned than i thought it would be, especially in comparison to my dish...so if you're very hungry, i would stray from this dish.  While normally a classic favorite, i didn't quite like the added spices to the dish, which seemed to be an Italian seasoning.  The alfredo sauce alone was to die for though.  The cannelloni was phenomenal.  Everything was cooked to perfection and flavored out of this world.   Please also note....when this food is done, it's coming to your table, steaming hot! So wait a few before you take your first bite because you'll probably burn your mouth in some way/shape/form! :o)  Overall the Grotto really picked up my night, and being a yankee in a western state...it's nice to have a piece of home right around the corner.  I'll definitely be coming back!",

The wine was awful and when my friend tried to talk with the owner about it he basically told her to shove off and leave him alone.  The salad was more of a soup with a few pieces of lettuce thrown in and I got horrible food poisoning from the linguini with clams.  When I called to let them know about it afterwards I was told that it could never have been a reaction to any of their food - it must have been something I ate elsewhere.  I knew this wasn't possible and told them so and they very rudely hung up on me.   I've been in the food industry for years and have never run across anything this crappy and obnoxious.

The food was pretty tasty as well, my only complaint was the amount of grease on some of the plates. I love eating, but not drinking all the grease from the friers. Other than that, no complaints.

I a My daughter and I had noticed this place in Scottsdale a week or so ago and it was crowded every time we walked by. Today we wanted something other than Mexican, so my daughter who is 11 said let's do this Italian place. We walked inside and were greeted by the owner, who is very cheerful and happy to see us and told us we could sit anywhere we liked on the patio. The place smelled deliciously of garlic. We went into use the ladies room first, and noticed a table inside but by one of the open floor to ceiling windows, so he asked if we could sit there and the owner said sure you and your daughter sit anywhere you like. A server came up to us shortly after brought us some waters, we did not order anything else to drink. Server came back a few minutes later (maybe a few minutes longer than we would've liked), and took our food order. He probably brought over some bread, and our meals arrive shortly there after. Our salads were fine, they were just small garden salad nothing to complain about or praise. I had the chicken piccata which consisted of two fairly large, well pounded chicken breasts in a delicious piccata sauce over a huge portion of pasta. My daughter had the angel hair Bolognese which was probably enough to feed three people. She loved it, and eats a lot of Bolognese, she was first turned onto it a few years ago on a trip to Italy. After meals we were offered coffee and dessert, which we declined and our server probably brought our check. The check was hand written, but it was correct. I handed over my credit card and he came right back with the bill. AFTER we left, I decided to check yelp to see what people thought of the restaurant. I almost fell over when I saw the terribly low ratings. So then I got nervous. I thought maybe there were rats in the kitchen and I had no idea! But I can't imagine that's True I truly did not see anything wrong with this restaurant, and I'm a bit of a snob. I will say this is very typical East Coast Italian food and experience. I am of Italian descent and grew up and currently live in the Northeast, and completely appreciate the comfort food we were served. The interior was a little dark and maybe not as upscale as one might expect in Scottsdale, but seriously, there was absolutely nothing wrong with our dining experience the food nor the service. I agree with some posters that there appeared to be a lot of red, watery eyes among the men working there, but I honestly can't say that anything else tipped me off that anything is amiss. I truly can't believe some of the reviews that I read it, but I am sure that the posters had the experience they claim they did, only because why would people make things up? However, If you are looking for satisfying delicious Italian comfort food, this is your place!",

The calamari was flavorless and 90% breading. The garlic bread was flat and sad looking but edible. For entrees, I ordered seafood Alfredo and my boyfriend had the ribeye. This food was truly disgusting. My cream sauce was thin and oily. There was tons of separation from the oil. The noodles were stuck together, I didn't even eat the seafood portion because I didn't feel comfortable with the food quality. My boyfriends steak was loaded with fat and over cooked per his medium rare request. His side dish of spaghetti was the saddest food I've ever seen. The \"sauce\" looked and tasted like tomato paste dumped out from a can, not a speck of herbs/spices could be spotted or tasted.

    "text": "On a warm spring afternoon we had a craving for pasta. I looked around for a place in the area and this seemed to be the best of limited options near Old Town Scottsdale. We made a reservation and Ubered over arriving a few minutes early.   The host who sat us seemed a little overwhelmed with what seemed like a light crowd. Our waiter was cordial and efficient but not very friendly. It was as if he was on auto pilot. I'm not one to make to harsh a judgement on one visit but the start was certainly less than smooth and inviting. We ordered up some drinks which were promptly delivered. The Knob Creek Manhattan was well made but could have benefited from a better vermouth and a couple luxardo cherries over the standard issue maraschino. The Vodka martini was well made, certainly the easier of the two drinks, but the one that suffers most if made improperly. The busboy was very engaging and made great conversation. He was the one staff we encountered that was really a plus.   We ordered a couple plates of pasta, mostly out of Yelp folks talking about the misses in execution of the more elevated dishes. I had the soup and my dining partner had the salad. Both were well prepared, nothing I would seek out on their own. The Italian dressing on the salad was nice, and the salad did have a nice assortment of ingredients.   The plates of pasta followed in short order. The Fettuccine Primavera was nice, good sauce, standard vegetables, but ultimately nothing much above average. Not that there is anything wrong with that. The other plate was spaghetti with mushroom sauce and homemade sausage. This was another highlight of the evening. The sauce was really tasty, though a little too heavy on salt. The mushrooms were in generous quantity and added a nice depth of flavor. The sausage was also a winner. A real homey / comfort food sort of plate. The prices were fair for the area. Some of the \"elevated\" dishes came with the expected \"elevated\" price. All in all I would come back, if I had the craving for above average in quality, and simply prepared pasta dishes.",

The owner was extremely aggressive and had an abusive attitude about him. I feel bad for his employees or anyone that has to deal with him. Anger management classes could come in real handy. Couldn't tell you about the food as we did not stay after observing his behavior, but it seems the previous reviews tell the story about the food at this \"establishment\".

Good salad before pasta with good home made salad dressing. Average bread, pretty commercial (in other words, not a good Italian baguette), but the butter was real and very flavorful for some reason. $15-18+ entrees. Red sauce a 6 out of 10 possible. Bathroom needs attending by a real cleaning service and restocked so we can dry our hands. Atmosphere was cozy...like a time capsule from the 70's, but the 50's music was annoying, as it always is...kind of threw things off. Service was good and jokes were also over used vintage stock jokes from the 70's....but at least he was trying. Old bar that's dark and cool on a hot summer day. Perfect for people who want to drink a cold beer in a cave, but don't want to bother to drive out into nature.",

The broth, which should be labeled water down, was flavorless and very thin. The mussels tasted old as well.  We opted to leave early and the only reason why I'm giving this place two stars instead of one is because the waiter comped our food.

We snagged the last table on the patio so we were able to enjoy our dinner and drinks while we watched the hustle and bustle going on around us. I went with the scallop scampo (sea scallops in a white wine & garlic butter sauce) plus I got to sample a bit of everyone's food since we each got something different (clams in a rose sauce, chicken parm with spaghetti and sausage with cheese ravioli). I thought everything was pretty tasty and the meals were reasonably priced (around $20/entree). We didn't make room for dessert (our server almost convinced us to cave in to the tiramisu) but we were able to enjoy the atmosphere for a little bit while we finished our drinks.  Is there better tasting pasta out there? Sure, but I didn't mind this place at all. I'd be back again if the opportunity came up.",

My husband went up to the host and asked for a napkin for my granddaughter. The host went to reach for the napkin and another staff member rushed up and said \"get the fuck out of here\" Shocked, my husband walked up to me and told me what had happened. (We were about 40 feet away. (My mother is disabled and walks very slow).  I told my husband that we should tell the manager about what had happened. I walked into the restaurant with my 6 year old granddaughter and went up to the person who appeared to by the manager (turns out he was the owner, Gary Horowitz) I was explaining to him what had happened and he yelled at me \" get the fuck out of here and take that thing, pointing to my granddaughter, with you). I was shocked. I said Sir, we just asked for a napkin. If you didn't want to give us one just say no. You don't have to be verbally abusive, especially in front of a 6 year old.\" He continued to scream profanities and insults at me and my granddaughter. At this time the owner was standing at the exit. Yelling and waving his arms. I think he may have been drunk or having withdraws. I was afraid to walk past him and I looked around for another exit but didn't see one. My granddaughter was completely pale, shaking and was terrified. Another patron seen the incident and got up and asked the owner what his problem was. The owner then turned his attention towards the other man and I was able to get out onto the sidewalk. The owner continued his verbal abuse even after we were able to get out. Ppl on the sidewalk attempted to assist asking us if we were ok. Everyone was in shock at what had happened. I ducked into the business next door to calm my granddaughter. They told me that the owner has done this before and that he has an alcohol problem. I wasn't sure if this was something I should bug the police for so I didn't call them. In hindsight, I should have. I wrote the city and they can do nothing since I didn't call the police. I did speak with the Scottsdale Police Department on Monday (the incident happened on Saturday) and they told me to definitely call them for these types of things.",

    "text": "A vacation to Arizona usually calls for some southern or mexican food in my family, but once in awhile we have our cravings from seafood, When we saw the sign of seafood pasta, we immediately thought to give it a try. Between three of us, we ordered an antipasto appetizer, two seafood pastas: one with clams and mussels, the other with scallops, and a spinach ravioli.   The antipasto was very good. It was very fabulous with lots of colors within the greens. It was refreshing, crisp, and all the flavors  in the vegetables were accented perfectly.  I did not favor our entrees. They were not the hottest, which led me to feel like I wished it had been made and delivered immediately after. I thought the quality of the seafood was great.  We were given tiramisu on the house which is what these three stars refer to. The tiramisu was beyond excellent. I would suggest skipping the entree and just getting the dessert when you visit. It will not disappoint.",

The wine we ordered was \"not available\" but our waiter suggested a substitute. I asked if it was the same kind of wine, trying to get a sense of whether the price was close to the wine we ordered. He said yes. When the bill came, we were stiff for $97, 3 times the price of the wine we ordered.  Staff refused to take our picture (it was a special family occasion) which would have taken a nanosecond, and of course we had the usual rudeness that so many other reviews mention. Food was good, fish was fresh, lasagna tired and almost meatless, however. Stiffing us for wine and the rudeness were not worth the food.  We can get excellent Italian food in many places in the Phoenix valley.",

It was a really wonderful evening. Very old school feel(no pun). Our server was a delightful older man and made us feel at home. My mother in law was very impressed when she had a small spill and her brought her soda water, and even a small pen to dab where needed.   The food was terrific. Had small bowl of clams (would have gone large if I knew how good they were) and really enjoyed the crusty bread with the broth. We had basic pasta dishes. All good and they included salads. This at a price of 10-12, per.   Dessert was a treat. Had heard the tiramisu was good and it was. The spumoni was also good and big enough to share.   Great evening!!",

He undertakes something difficult in a desert environment--preparation of seafood based dishes, most of which are delicious, if a bit heavy-handed on the garlic.  The only criticism is fully cooked rather than al dente pasta, and uneven service.  Waiters can be informal to the point of careless.  I'd recommend a better selection of wines by the glass, and refreshing the decor, which is dated.",

I tried one of their seafood pastas once that was really good and the last time I got a chicken dish with pasta that was great as well. I like how they have the open window/door things too so it feels kind of like you're outside but you're actually inside. It isn't all that cheap so definitely be aware of that. You also get bread and a salad or soup before your dish so come hungry! I always leave with leftovers which makes me happy! Great spot to come with family or on a date. Stiff drinks too :)",

It was our first time ever going,  he walked by us three times before coming over to us.  He pitched the menu's on our table and asked what we wanted to drink.  I had been excited about getting a real espresso before lunch and told him we had never been here before and asked if they had a drink menu.  He rattled of \"full bar, coke products and water\".  I asked If they had any types of coffees,  and he said \"yeah I can get you a coffee,  or an espresso\" .. Well If you have espresso then you can make cappuccino right?  I asked for one of them,  some water and a Dr Pepper for my son.  He brought back the drinks with no water, and then got irritated when I asked for water!  He walked off,  didn't at all ask if we wanted bread while we looked at the menu.  I had to flag another waiter down, in order to get our waiters attention, rudely he said what else can I get you?  I had  a 20.00 out and said a to go cup and the change for our drinks. He said sorry we don't have to go cups,  took my money came back and laid change on the table,  no receipt, and walked away.  So then I had to ask ANOTHER waited for a receipt.  The same dude walks up and writes on a piece of paper 5+3=8, shoves it towards me and walks off again. Called the folks meeting me and said we are meeting somewhere else,  this place is a dive!!

    "text": "Worst dining experience of my life. I've been using Yelp to find new places to eat around Phoenix for the last few weeks, and until now the reviews have been pretty accurate. Not so with this place, our evening turned into the kind of nightmare that I've read about in a few reviews and thought that they were just too bad to be real.. well, this one is real!  As some of the other reviewers indicated, the staff is not friendly at all. I can look past that for good food, so long as they're not downright rude. My girlfriend is gluten intolerant, and we explained to the waiter that she can't have either pasta or breading, so she ordered the only chicken dish on the menu that didn't have any breading; I ordered the cannelloni.  Our food arrived, and her dish was completely wrong - it was a big pasta dish with vegetables on top, and no chicken. We called the waiter over, told him that the order was wrong, and grabbed it angrily and walked away, not even apologizing. A few minutes later, a dish with just chicken on it was placed in front of my girlfriend, with nothing else. She cut a piece of the chicken, and immediately tasted breading (and furthermore, she said that the chick was VERY tough). I tried my cannelloni, and it was downright disgusting - cheap pre-made crepe, and the meat was dry.  The waiter then re-appeared with the vegetables that were previously atop the pasta, scattered about onto a plate, and he told us that he pulled \"most\" of the pasta out.  We called the waiter back over and explained that our dining experience has been a disaster here, and we were going to go elsewhere, and offered to pay for the soup and salad which we got before the meal. He angrily grabs the plates and hurries off, then comes back with a piece of paper with '11' scribbled across it. When I told him that I thought that was a ridiculous price to pay for a tiny soup and salad, after the experience we had just had, he snaps back, \"You have two choices - either pay the $11, or we call the cops and haul your ass out\". I asked to speak to the manager, who was just as rude.   I paid the $11 and told them that no friends of mine would ever dine at that restaurant. I would highly discourage anyone, friend or not, to ever step foot in that place again. Worst. Restaurant. Ever.",

    "text": "My husband and I had a truly great experience here. The staff were wonderful, loved the Frank Sinatra music, the food and the overall atmosphere. My husband had the veal which he raved about and I had the Seafood Special for that night which was truly sumptuous! But a word of warning....the choice was a creamy sauce or a spicy tomato based sauce .... I chose the spicy tomato based sauce which I was given the choice of 1-10 for spice.....I like spicy but decided to try and be safe and say a 5 due to the fact we were going to see the John Cleese show at a theatre near by and did not want to be sniffling the whole time!......The 5 tasted like a 10.....phew....wowser!!!....don't get me wrong....i LOVE spicy....at home I could go to levels off the chart...but only because I have easy access to tissues and no one is judging me! : ) .....I really did enjoy it but if I had known the True meaning of a five I would have probably said a one! lol The seafood...comprising of mussels, prawns, fish, scallops and baby octopus was divine!  The appetizer of tomato garlic bread was also amazingly good....the tomato dip was really rich and tasty....much better than what we had expected. And I must not forget the desserts.... the house made Tiramisu and Cannoli was AMAZING! Try it with a small glass of Grand Marnier and you are in some kind of heaven!  Also two added bonuses....I got roses from my husband from a flower seller who walked through the restaurant AND when we asked for a photo our very nice waiter yelled out \"Hey Paparazzo!\" and along came running  a wonderful waiter who was in his home town a professional photographer....and I would believe him...most people look at cameras like it is a totally foreign object....he was using the zoom etc... like he knew exactly what he was doing! lol  This was a truly great night for us....can definitely recommend. : )",

He personal sits everyone who comes into his restaurant and is just a really interesting guy. My friends and I were waiting for a table and were eventually seated at \"The WORST table EVER!\" called this by the owner. At first we were a little weirded out that we were almost guests with another table, but once we introduced ourselves and got through the formalities all went well. And we got to see what they ordered, which made it easier for us to order.  Oh and lets not forget that the Owner paid for our desserts, because we were at \"The WORST table EVER\" which the owner yelled at us each time he passed! What's better than great food, but great food an entertainment too! OK the FOOD was very very good. The Caesar salad was just Meh...but the Calamari with a spicy marinara was DELISH! And the Mussels Portifino we exceptional. The mussels were so tender they melted in your mouth. The Shrimp Franchaise, was superb! Don't forget the best Tiramisu I have had in a really long time! Can't wait to go back!!",

    "text": "The Italian Grotto isn't exactly for the faint of heart. The waitstaff is mostly a bunch of older guys from new york and they are a little gruff and direct. Personally, I like it. They once chastisted my sister for moving her bread plate :) The guy said \"Your bread plate goes to the LEFT of your dinner plate!\" and we didn't really know what to say to that, LOL! I am sure that a lot of people are offended by this, but what can I say? I like smartasses!  I've been here twice now. Giving this place 4 stars might be a touch of a stretch because I absolutely noticed some problems. Here we go:  Appetizers: I've had the fried zucchini and the fried calamari. Both obviously homemade and fantastic. Calamari was very tender and not at all chewy. Zucchini needed a little salt, but after that it was perfect.   Salad: I love a salad that doesn't look like it came out of a bag. I've had the blue cheese twice now and I doubt I'll try anything else soon because I like those big ol chunks of blue cheese in there!  Entrees: On my first trip, I tried the Chilean sea bass pomodoro on top of ravioli. The sea bass was great, and the pomodoro sauce was just incredible, but the ravioli tasted gummy and bland, and I actually feared it might have been frozen... God, I hope not. Incidentally, I wanted to ask the server if it was the endangered chilean sea bass or if it was farmed... since it's being overfished and all... but I was genuinely afraid to ask my server about this since I was pretty sure he would call me a name that ends with \"ussy\" and starts with a P, and roll his eyes at my yuppie self. On this same visit, a friend of mine had a chicken dish which was SADLY overcooked and dry was could be, and another friend had the fruits del mer (?), a fettucine alfredo with calamari, salmon, shrimp, scallops and mussels, and it was great, all the fish was cooked to perfection. My next trip I had the sea bass florentine (I KNOW, I should have tried something else, but I just love me some sea bass) and it was incredibly good, seabass topped with spinach and ricotta. However, they forgot to season either the fish or the spinach, but after I salted the dish I thought it was fantastic. My friend had the ravioli pomodoro and she thought it was great, so maybe she didn't think they were gummy, maybe I just caught the raviolis on a bad night!  My recurring issue is that I don't think the chef(s) are properly seasoning the food, if they WERE, I would probably give them 5 stars right now.  However, given that MINOR issue, there is so little good old-fashioned Italian food in this town that the Italian Grotto still has almost no competition, and they WERE mostly fantastic! So, I will be back, no doubt at all. I'll just remember to leave my bread plate on the left and not ask any wussy questions about sustainable fish :)",

    "text": "My sweetie and I found this place in Scottsdale on a very hot July evening. It looked cute and inviting and we decided to try it out.   Far from the schizophrenic service mentioned in other reviews, our waiter(s)- all of them waited on us at one time or another- were great fun. Cheeky conversation mixed with good suggestions from the menu. We came up with entirely too much food, which was just fine with us as it was all delicious. Started with a minestrone soup which was better than mine, which is sayin' something because I make great soups. Then moved onto pasta with Alfredo sauce, good again, and I had chicken cacciatore while my partner had ravioli. The cacciatore was just how I would have made it- a light, spicy sauce rather than the gloppy sweet stuff most restaurants make- over a good sized chicken breast and spaghetti. It tasted like Grandma's Sunday dinners.  I took most of it home- in fact it made two lunches for me. Of course, with all the yummy bread and the two first courses we had, naturally it would have been too much. The ravioli was great too. By the time we finished our meal, we were just so full- would have loved to have tried the canoli, we told the waiter, but  just couldn't order another dish. A couple minutes later, he came over with a lovely filled canoli and two spoons- \"Happy New Year\", he exclaimed, centering the canoli in front of us.    The only thing I can say that was a bit of a distraction in this great place was the Sinatra could have been just a tiny bit softer- although it was the perfect soundtrack to the dark set.  Our service was attentive, conversational, and welcoming. If you are looking for formal or stuffy, this is probably not the place for you- service comes with a bit of a Jersey edge here.  We are new part-time homeowners in the Phoenix area. Will we be back? You betcha. It was one of the most memorable evenings of our trip, and we can't wait to go back for more.",

Complete with tables being pulled out, terse yet endearing fat men barking \"what cha want to drink\", and INCREDIBLE Italian food. Two words, Chilean Sea Bass... three words i guess. It is served SWIMMING in garlic and butter over a bed of linguine. It is so tender it falls apart just watching you pick up your fork but beware of the killer garlic breath that will ensue once you have licked your plate clean. By no means cheap but worth every penny. Cannelloni, salad, parm ... amazing, i have never had a bad meal here.  I will be stopping by when i am home for xmas, it is that good.",

I was done with my meal by the time our waiter asked about her plate ( he took the plate away and said the \"boss is fixing it.\")  The \"boss\" came back from the kitchen with the original veal re-plated as a thinned down version of the original and blamed the saltiness on the Romano cheese.   [I've seen  the movie Waiting and could not discern what thinning agent they used.]  She did not taste the rinsed off version of the Veal Piccata.  She sent the plate back a second time.  The waiter told me that the boss and the chef had tasted her food and it was fine;  that same plate was redelivered to her to eat.  They charged us full price for the entree and offered no renumeration for their inedible meal.   Loved the soup, good wine and my Chicken Marsala, but when faced with candid legitimate criticism, they were indignant, incredulous, and rude.",

When I asked for a table, he saw I was alone and told me I could sit at the bar.  Being I'd been working all day, I had my computer bag with me and I wanted to sit down and enjoy a meal.  He reluctantly seated me.  I ordered the garlic bread appetizer and baked ziti.  He told me the meal comes with soup or salad, I ordered the salad with ceasar dressing on the side.  I was told ceasar dressing would cost the same as a ceasar salad, $8 more dollars.  Of course this is ridiculous, so I asked for the regular salad, NO dressing.  He repeated that, I said yes, and he said ok, that and your garlic bread will be out soon.  So, my salad comes and it's a really beautiful salad, large portion, fresh veggies, and drowning in dressing.  Two bites into it, I couldn't stand it and placed it on the other side of the table.  10 mins later my waiter noticed it, and I reminded him, no dressing.  I said don't worry about it.  He said he'd take care of it.  He came back with a ceasar salad with the dressing on the side.  Very nice, but the salad was lettuce, lettuce, lettuce, a peppercinni, and two rings of red onion.  What?  I thought this was an Italian place.   So, a basket of bread shows up and a few minutes later my entree arrives.  It was pretty good, but nothing special.  A different server came by and I stopped him to ask if the bread in the basket was my garlic bread (it was so dark there was no way to tell).  He said no, I asked to please have it sent out so I could enjoy it with the rest of my meal.  A couple minutes later I see him telling my server the problem and they were close enough that I spoke up to tell him, yes, the garlic bread never came.  The helping server looked at me and yelled, \"They're making it!\"  Excuse me??  Now I've got 3 bites left and my waiter stops by my table and says, \"do you want us to make you some garlic bread on us?\"  What?  By this time it should have already come out.  Why are you asking me now if I want it?  I ordered it didn't I?  And get this, he didn't even wait for me to answer.  I took another 15 minutes to get my check.  And yes, I still tipped %15 even though they should have been sending me out with a comp dessert.  Which is really a shame because I'm a very generous tipper.  Not that night!  One thing they do have going for them, the only thing they are on top of offering fresh pepper and parm cheese on appropriate items.  Needless to say, I will not be going back to Italian Grotto, AND I will make sure none of my many co-workers waster their or company money at this hole!!",

Besides the Owner being a character and charming the food  was outrageously good. It was like being in Ny . The Chicken piccata  was tender and full of flavor , and the drinks were REAL  drinks. Great bartenders as well . We stayed for over 3 hours and watched the sports with all the guys at the bar. Great place to come if your on business.. Well be back for sure",

We were seated by the host who appeared to be drunk because he was pretty damn obnoxious.   We waited for 7 minutes before we got a menu. Once the menu finally arrived we put in a drink order because the service was obviously going to be slow.........and boy was it slow!   We ordered calamari, mussels, and a caesar salad after waiting for what seemed like forever.   The calamari was good but nothing special, the mussels were pretty awesome, and the caesar salad was not that great and had no taste.   The waiter never offered any parmesan cheese or cracked pepper for the caesar salad and was no where to be found for us to make the request.   The mussels were good but everything else including the drink was not good and the service was basically non existent.",

    "text": "If there was a 0 star, I'd put it. I created this profile just for this, this was Worst Restaurant to go to in Old Town EVER!!, I was surprised to see a lot of people there tonight for the first time, which happens to be Valentines. Every time we pass by we usually never go in because it's almost always empty and so we don't get motivated to go( now I know WHY!!!).   We arrive at 6 for a party of 3, after every other restaurant around had about 1-3 hour waits, so at the time it looked a bit busy and that they had availabilities, so we chose it to have dinner. It was Simply THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!! .. We had to wait 2 hours for our food. The manager shows up as soon as they bring out the appetizers, and we look at the waiter, this guy says \" don't talk to him he's not your waiter!- the waiter was nice and he had this confused look on his face and walked away-  and talks to my friend and asks him what he wanted, my friend doesn't speak English very well and I have to translate for him, so I ask my friend what he wanted, and the manager ( Gary, greasy guy with long grey hair and smells like booze, in a Hawaiian shirt) he cuts me and says I'm not talking to YOU , I'm talking to him ( in a very rude aggressive manner), I'm like Excuse me?? .. and he walked away!.. I ask my friends is this guy high on something or drunk or what?? Its not a professional behavior  and not something I've experienced at any restaurant in old town... So after we ate the food and the check came , we looked at the check and it's $92.85!! I'm like okay let's split it 3 ways, so the waiter takes our cards and then the manager shows up with the cards , shouting at us \" WE don't do this at this restaurant we only take one card, pick a card! pick a card, .. i tell him well there must be a way, he is like i SAID PICK A CARD! OR ILL DO IT .. I'm like no what is this , we want to split it! he keeps saying PICK A CARD really angry and shouting , everyone in the restaurant started staring, so we just picked one and I'm like thats so rude, he comes back he says EVERY RESTAURANT HAS RULES, I'm like you can have rules but you don't have to be rude like that, and he says \" we have rules\" repeatedly \"are you listening to me\", i say I'm not going to listen to you if you don't listen to me , listen to your customer, he says you're not my customer, I'm not going to \" F word\" see you again, you come here eat and be out the door, and called me a Douchebag!!!! I'm like you're the douchebag and go away- he kept talking- and i just telling to GO AWAY!! GO AWAY!!... So Rude and unprofessional, it should not be in old town, shouldn't be anywhere , such a bad disrespectful staff, and extremely rude. They Don't deserve a penny! NEVER AGAIN, like the many other reviews on here, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were looking to celebrate because I got a new job and he made a big sale for work. Therefore, we began looking up good Italian food on Yelp and found the Italian Grotto, which happens to be right by where by boyfriend works.   We went to dinner pretty early so we were one of the very few people in there besides  some individuals whom were there for happy hour. We started with a nice bottle of chardonnay and calamari. We were big fans of the calamari, I tend to see quite a few reviews on Yelp that suggest some people think all calamari was created equal and I disagree. The breading was very light and crispy and had some spice to it, the squid itself was very tender and was what I consider the perfect consistency for fried calamari.   One of the only downfalls of the whole meal was the bread that was first brought out. We were pretty hungry when we got in and the bread didn't come until right before the calamari, a good 10 minutes after the drinks, and when it came it became clear that this bread had been sitting out for quite some time and was starting to harden up. Certainly not a deal breaker but something I tend to look forward to when heading out for Italian cuisine.   Next came the salads, I had the red wine vinaigrette and my boyfriend had the bleu cheese. Both of the dressings had great taste, my only criticism would be that the lettuce was not dried off very well after washing, once again not a huge issue, but something we remembered.   Finally, the entrees. I ordered the scallops in a white wine sauce over a bed of pasta, and my boyfriend got the Chilean sea bass over spinach ravioli. Not the absolute best scallops or piece of Chilean sea bass we had ever had but the sauces they came in were to die for. Then the waiter noticed how much we were digging the sauce and brought us out a basket of fresh bread still warm and soft. I don't think they had to put those plates in the dishwasher after we were through with them.   Our server did a great job, he was knowledgeable, friendly, and most importantly gave you space without being negligent. The atmosphere was precisely what I look for in an Italian restaurant. It's casual enough to be fun and relaxed, great music playing the whole time (Dean, Frank and company), very colorful obscure painting on the walls, but also had the ambiance to back up its pricing.   We wanted to get desert but we had a hard time standing up straight we were so full. So we didn't for a while, enjoyed our seat next to the window as the sun was setting on Old Town Scottsdale and watched the world go by as we finished up our bottle of chardonnay. All in all a tad on the expensive side but I certainly will be going back to try a few other things on the menu.",

Additionally, the side of pasta was fabulous, also able to add spice. It was recommended that I don't go above 2 if I'd never been here before. I took a chance at 5, and it was perfect in every flaming way. But on the edge and don't let it go down wrong or risk death by coughing. My lips are still tingling. I wouldn't want to see what 10 is like!  Atmosphere sportsy, but really cool. Owner seems like a cranky Brooklyn gypsy/pirate (in the most respectful way.) I'd definitely come back.",

I ordered the Chilian Bass which was awesome, then followed it with ricotto filled cannoli.

I had the veal carolina, which was among the best Italian I've ever had.  My wife had baked ravioli, which she thought was just alright.  The other couple we were with liked their food as well, one having a different veal dish and the other the sea bass.  The service really wasn't all that lousy but it definitely was sub par (we waited for the check for a while).  This is probably because our waiter was an ex-football player who we're sure was concussed one too many times.  Another waiter (we're assuming the owner) saw to our table as well and talked to us how the other waiter isn't going anywhere.  It's good to see people taking care of people.  Though the service wasn't the quickest, our drinks were always full and the waiters are happy to chit chat.  Very personable and quite the characters.  I'd be happy to go back and try some more of their food.  It's a bit pricier than places not in Scottsdale but I've had worse food that was more expensive (like Rustler's Roost).",

    "text": "We come to Scottsdale seasonally each winter but this was the first time we tried the Italian Grotto. It is located on a prime corner in Old Town Scottsdale, so it is most definitely geared for tourists although I'm certain they have a local following as well. All of the people we dealt with were very friendly and service oriented. Each one seemed to be in character matching the theme of the restaurant. Sports memorabilia adorn the walls and other photos, etc. that fit the restaurant/ sports bar theme they have chosen. My wife had the eggplant parmesan ($21) which was good and I had the spaghetti and meatballs. ($14) which was just OK. Their sauce for the spaghetti is a bit too sweet and has too much basil in it for my taste. So, you can see the prices are really too high for typical Italian dinner menu items. We also ordered garlic bread ($6). It was over priced for what we expected. After drinks, our bill was about $67 before tip. That is just too much for what we got. So, you might want to think about that before you try it. I understand it has been there for some 42 years, so they are definitely a landmark place in Old Town. We might go back for a special dinner during a night out, but not for a regular meal.",

You will feel exactly the same in either case - the gas station option is saves you time.  I returned from a trip to discover that they added a $10 as additional tip to my bill The service staff and the owner were  very unfriendly and they don't deserve a tip let alone an additional $10 They deserve to go out of business   Remember: flush $20 and go home",

    "text": "We too never got an opportunity to eat here.  After waiting at the door behind a party of 4 for about 5 minutes with no host or hostess I asked the party in front of us how long the wait was.  They said they did not know but had been waiting there for 10 mintues waiting to be greeted.    I decided to walk into the restaurant and look for some help.  I spotted a server and smiled and asked what the wait time was explaining that no one was there to greet us.  He looked as though he was going to help and started walking towards me and then past me and said they were busy.  No sorry someone will be right with you we are a little busy.  Just a rude curt get out of my way kind of attitude.    I walked right back to our party of four and said this place is rude let's get out of here.  We went to Bucca Di Beppo across the way and were greeted with big smiles and open arms.  The staff was amazing!  Shaken by my experience with the rude waiter I asked our waiter at Bucca to provide me with a duplicate receipt of our dinner bill.    I took the receipt back to Italian Grotto and wanted to speak to a manager explaining how they lost the business due to a rude waiter.  Well I never showed the receipt because again there was no host in the lobby so I proceed to walk into the restuarant to find the manager.  I was stopped by a halfbaked and drunk man with an empty bottle of wine in his hand in a gray shirt with gray hair and two diamond earrings in his ear.  He approached me and said you looking for someone.  I replied yes the owner or manager please.  He stood there and acted as though he were the person.  I asked are you the owner?  He said why are you asking me questions? I never asked you questions?  I turned to my friend and said they cannot be the owner.  I again asked and got the same response.    He ordered us out of the dining room and told us to talk to him on the tile area considered their tiny lobby.  I walked back and he was beligerent and drunk and proceeded to tell me that I was the rudest person he ever met.    Complete whackjob!  I agree that friends have to be writing these positive reviews.  Dick's Last Resort known to be rude on purpose posed as angels to this place.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying, I work in television. Specifically, I work on television shows that rip managers like the one here new assholes in front of millions of people. Say what you want about Kitchen Nightmares, Bar Rescue and Kitchen Impossible, but we take people like the manager that works here and kick them to the curb where lowlifes like her belong. The only thing I can say is I WISH we were shooting this bar so I could give this bitch what she deserves. The following is a detailed encounter with the WORST MANAGER I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY CAREER. Skip to the second to last paragraph if you just want the punchline. I'll understand.   I'll set the scene for you: It's a Thursday night, my crew and I are on location working on said television show in Scottsdale. My boyfriend is from New York and we were looking to catch the Knicks game. Alas, we were pointed to \"the best Italian joint in Arizona\" by a neighboring bar owner. We walk on over and set up shop in a lovely little bar, we chat it up with the Bartender, TR, he's great, welcoming, from jersey, he even shares tales of the owner's history in New York. Everything is going swimmingly, what a great night out with friends, right? We order a few appetizers  bucket of clams, bucket of mussels and 3 light beers. All delicious. Atmosphere is beautiful, great old school music, just a great New Yorker's bar.   One of our guys is an HUGE Ucla fan so of course, he brought his Ipad with him so he could stream the UCLA game. This is where shit begins to quickly go south. My friend asks the TR if he could use the wireless to stream a little better. TR kindly directs us to a heavy set, dark haired woman bundled up like she's never been in weather below 80 degrees before. My friend kindly approaches her and asks if she's the manager. Her reply: \"I don't work here\".... hmmm My friend and I are perplexed... Well that strange because  TR just said you were the manager. My friend, confused, turned to TR assuming he must have asked the wrong woman. Nope, that was her and she just told us she didn't work here. Annoyed but polite, my friend leans over to her to get her attention and confront her about saying she didn't work here. He's joking with her at first, with a smile on his face. Her quip back to my friend, no lie this is what she said, \"WHAT DO YOU WANT?\". My friend is taken back by her aggressive nature and explains all he was going to ask was if he could use the internet. She aggressively tells him she doesn't know the password and walks to the end of the bar, yells over customers to TR (the nicest bartender on the planet) not to direct customers to her and if they want internet \"THEY CAN PAY FOR 4G\"* *Personal Note: Bitch, we have 4G.  We kept our mouths shut until we finished our drinks and food. Contemplated staying because the locals at the bar acknowledged the manager is known for being a bitch. TR was so great and welcoming and apologized for her behavior. Sadly, despite TR's attempt, we had to leave out of purpose alone. We close our tab, take care of TR because he's awesome and make our way to the door.   Before making our way completely out the door, my friend leans over to the manager and QUIETLY lets her know A) She's a terrible manager and B) we're leaving because of her. That's when she literally went Cat. 5-Batshit-Crazy on us. Screaming at my friend in front of the ENTIRE Restaurant, \"DON'T POINT YOUR FINGER AT ME!!!\" \"IF YOU WEREN'T SO CHEAP TO PAY FOR 4G YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM\" We let her know politely we're leaving and she's acting crazy to her reply, \"LEAVE MOTHER FUCKERS!\" Yep. She called us mother fuckers for asking if we could use the internet. \"DON'T FUCKING COME BACK HERE YOU CHEAP ASSHOLES.\" Yep. That was another one that really stood out.   It's a shame. We roll with a crew of 60 people and every city we're in, we take over a local bar and restaurant for the 3 weeks we're in town. We understand the hospitality industry and we applaud great work and most of the time overlook bad behavior. I can honestly say I've never experienced such shocking behavior from anyone in the industry ever. I'm still completely blown away by how incredibly aggressive this woman was and how such a great place can employ such toxic behavior. I can say, despite TR's attempt to get us to come back, myself, nor anyone from our crew will bring business here while we're in town.   With Love,  K",

We saw the NY Yankees sign out front and decided this was the place to eat being away from home. First off when we walked in the owner who was also the host ignored my mother and I and asked my step dad the only man in our party where he wanted to sit. We were sat inside in the back it was quite and nice which was probably one of the only positives out of this experience. Our waiter Drew had to be on some form of narcotics because he was slurring his words and not standing correctly. My mother then ordered spaghetti meat sauce with a chicken cutlet on top and was charged for a chicken parm dinner. The other 2 chicken dishes were average. We also ordered drinks 2 beers and a terrible glass of wine. I think the dollar store sells better wine. Over all this was a terrible experience and we will never be back on our future visits to Arizona. Should have waited the half hour to eat at Grimaldi's about 2 blocks away. Better luck next time",

Wait staff should check in with diners at least once in a while. At least keep drinks refilled and make sure all is ok after each course is delivered. Tonight we were totally ignored. No checking back at all. To add insult to injury, when the poor service was pointed out to both the owner and waiter they each argued with us. Busy night (and it wasn't). They were keeping an eye on the table even without asking if anything was needed (and it was needed and this nonverbal thing did NOT work). We got what we needed (owner brought drinks since waiter hadn't stopped by). What happened to customer service?!  And we heard both the waiter and owner arguing with other diners.",

    "text": "Update: After leaving my recent review I decided to read the reviews of others and I am appalled by reports of the owner's actions and discrimination. It appears that the owner, Garry, now owns the new EAT West of Brown (old Cider Mill) near the Italian Grotto (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scottsdaleaz.gov%2FAsset59708.aspx&s=c7633b97198925937710fa2e4e91e1d00c3e0fe2a09c218aa10b61cf12a78d88\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">scottsdaleaz.gov/Asset59...</a>). I would strongly recommend avoiding this establishment if you, like me, do not condone this type of belligerent behavior.  I created a Yelp account specifically to write this review to warn others not to eat at this restaurant. Our server was nice enough, but left part way through our service and the others didn't seem to care much, weren't helpful, and you can tell they don't like their job here. Ordered angel hair bolognese and had to ask our server if it had meat in it or if there was a mistake because there was so little of it. He did take the dish back after we asked this, but the second wasn't much better. Also ordered linguini with \"white clam sauce\" which ended up being pasta in a flavorless watery broth. Not only were these dishes nothing like what they were named, they did not taste good. For these prices ($100 for our dinner) I would strongly suggest that you spend your money elsewhere. There are so many other great options in Old Town.",

I am a seasoned cook and foodie and eat out often, and by no means this is acceptable anywhere. Even when I used to live in NYC they would never get away with charging that, and if so, it would be in a top notch restaurant in the city.   The worst part was when my boyfriend's mom nicely requested a tad more cheese for her pasta and the owner almost dumped the whole cheese bowl in her plate!

We walked in and were seated right away as there were only 12 people in the place. So as we've been seated for 10 minutes we have no clue what to order drink/ appetizers since we had no menu. I ordered a PBR draft and received a Laguanitas. Didn't want to be difficult and do love Laguanitas, but was looking for a domestic on draft.   Finally we receive our menus and order a appetizer, which was decent. We order full meals complimented by a soup or salad. 4 of the 6 of us order soup, needless to say the Minestrone soup came out cold. We push all soup to the middle of the table and the owner screams at the waiter, at this point we don't want soup. So we ask for salads instead, the owner took our soups threw them back in the pot and tried re-serve them back to us. We all decided at this point to not eat them. So our meals come at which point I'm sketchy about, they were somewhat decent. All around bad vibe there, average service, hillbilly drunks hanging at the bar, gross ASS bathrooms, and a horrible owner as he counts his money at the front door before customers leave and its closing time. Bill for our group of 6 was $200! DON'T Spend your money here, I'm sure there's  better.",

    "text": "Do not go here if you want to be treated kindly!!!! My husband and I were enjoying our Scottsdale staycation.  We had been up and down the Old Town Scottsdale, done some wine tasting, had lunch.  Overall just enjoying our couples time.  As we were coming up on this restaurant, I said I need to use the restroom and then we can settle down and have a drink and get a snack at the bar.  I walked in and started to head straight to the bathroom. The owner chased me down, yelling at me that the bathroom is for paying customer only, I said I plan on going to the bar once I use the restroom, he yelled at me to get out.  At this point I am completely confused on what is happening I look up and some big fat guy (MEATBALL-Seems awful proud of a name that means dull, stupid or foolish) and says I need to leave.  My husband is as stunned as I am and he is trying to figure out what the heck is going on.  I just turn around say ok, and then tell the owner he is a douchebag they literally chased us out the door.  I still have no idea what happened.  This took place in a restaurant full of people.  I might have been embarrassed if I wasn't so shocked by what happened.  I called later to complain about the treatment and Meatball said everything had been recorded and I was now officially harassing them!  When I looked this place up on Yelp, I see this is a common occurrence. The owner needs to sober up (it was pretty clear he had too much to drink) and get a clue, you cannot continue to treat people so poorly and stay in business.",

I can't think of words to describe how great this place is for a nice quiet date.   I would recommend you ignore these bad reviews. The waiters are charismatic and I'm guessing these people have thin skin. Their charm is half the fun. Same with my barber shop: all the bad reviews are people who don't have personality.

I ordered the chicken parm work the pasta aglio e olio and he gave me confused look and said \"huh????\"  I explained it to him and he said,  \"so you want chicken parm with no marinara?\"  No!  Chicken parm comes with marinara,  i want the chicken parm as usual,  i want the pasta aglio e olio.  When he brought it out the pasta wad loaded with marinara.  He told me he had the cooks add the marinara on top of the olive oil.    Not knowing what aglio e olio is in an Italian restaurant is like not knowing what fries ate in a burger joint.    The food was ok, minestrone soup wad kind of bland, entree wad actually decent,  even with the fiasco. I would not go back",

Like a responsible single lady I wanted to use the restroom before settling in to the empty bar....the facility was so filthy I didn't even lock the door or wash my hands.   Wondering what the kitchen must be like I decided there was no way I was eating there. A drink? Still maybe...nobody was tending the bar as I walked up so I started to leave. A blonde woman appeared out of nowhere and asked what she could get me to which I replied \"oh nothing thank you.\" She then blasted me for just wanting to use the restroom. She's been in old town long enough and knows my game. I just was like ok and walked out.   10 feet down the street I'm assuming Gary the owner yells \"I hope the rest of your day is honest!\" I turned around and said honestly I'm just not feeling this place. He continued to yell verbal insults as I walked my fine ass down the street.   Went to the Grapevine, had a great lunch and 3 Moscow mules. Very clean bathroom to boot. Going back tonight for their chicken parm and karaoke night because that place doesn't suck.   Yankees suck. The Grotto sucks. Either go out of business or be a star on Kitchen Nightmares. Yuck.",

My friend and I ate lunch around 2pm on a sunny afternoon 10.27.18. After seating us outside, I didn't get a napkin. I had to get up and get one off another table. Then our water came. My glass was dirty, so I asked for another one. He never refilled my water until the meal was over. I refilled my glass several times.  Everything on the menu was pasta. I'm trying to loose weight so I wanted a salad. All I saw was ceasar salads with chicken,  salmon or shrimp.  I ended up ordering a salad with oil and vinegar dressing with the salmon. What a waste. It came with plain lettuce and salmon for $16!!  Don't waste your money or time here, go somewhere else.",

Come to find out the owner is sitting at the bar getting drunk before waiting on the customers trying to spend money. After a few more minutes he decides to come seat us and he is wearing open toed flip flops with his ferocious toe nails showing. Yuck, in a restaurant?   Tried to let it pass but we got to the table and were forced with \"we are old, it's really good food.\" Took one look at my silverware and realized it was dirty.  You won't believe what's next!!! The silverware was picked up by the owner dipped into a water pitcher and then wiped on the table in front of us... as if this cleans things. Of course the silverware was returned to us.   I am still not sure why we didn't leave yet, maybe it was because he was over our shoulders yelling at his waitress and told her to mind her own business and get inside. Once he turned the corner we booked it. Full sprint and yeah... I wouldn't take my worst enemy there. Thanks good luck!",

    "text": "Its a shame how bad this place has become.  We went there for the firat time 15 years ago when we first moved to scottsdale and it was a great dining experience and great food.  We have been back a couple of times over the years to try to recapture that experience and it unfortunately, no matter how hard we try to enjoy it just gets worse and worse the food and the help.        We went last night, and it was busy, and we were seated right away to their credit, and a nice booth too, felt great about it, even ordered some drinks that we were not planning on having but wanted to show some gratitude for the nice quick seating.       We ordered our food and it was all downhill, it took a long time and they messed up my wifes salad and as i was eating the soup i had to wonder when it was made.  You kind of get the feeling they may not be doing so well and expect gordon ramsey to jump up at any moment and tell everyone to stop eating and hes closing the kitchen.      Now the fun part, so we keep waiting for our food, waiting waiting, my wife says this is enough and we get up to leave, i was preparred to pay for the drinks and salad and soup, preparred to overpay actually, and like something out of a bad movies as they saw us getting up came over and slammed our food on the tables as if to say \"ha we beat you before you could leave#       We took one bite of the food and it was not good and we ordered expensive dinners, we informed the waiter that we were not enjoying it had taken one bite and wanted to leave.  He told us without even asking anything that we had made a verbal agreement with the establishment and if we left he would call the police.  Wow!  We were not trying to get out on our bill .. just a ridiculous way to handle that situation, then the owner came over and started yelling at us and telling us off.        So we ended up paying $120 for a side salad and cup of soup and 2 beers.  The food us so bad we didnt even eat it and just left it.        The waiter did come up and apologize before we left which was nice it was obvious to anyone around that they were out of line, and the owner made some smart ass comment as we left.        If it was 15 years ago id highly recommend it, your money will be terribly wasted there now days and will probably result in one of the worse dinning experiences you will ever have which usually ends in a bad rest of the night with your significant other if you now what im talking about.      Way to many other great choices to eat at in that area, stay away from this place you will thank me.",

    "text": "I have to admit, I am using the Yelp star rating less and less - and the Italian Grotto is a perfect example of why.  When in Scottsdale a few weeks ago I asked a couple long time residents working at Don & Charlies where else they suggest going for dinner when I was coming back in a couple weeks with my wife.  2 of the 3 mentioned the Italian Grotto as another old school Scottsdale place with local flavor and good food.  Checking the Yelp reviews it seems a lot of people have bad service.  What I have found is that I rarely get bad service, so I always discount those reviews.  So I went ahead and made a reservation for the following Saturday night after our Spring training game.  I am glad I did.    In summary - we were seated at the time of our reservation, the waiter was great (well spoken, friendly, informative, and prompt), our table was good, the food/wine was very good, and the prices fairly reasonable.  I would recommend this place, except maybe during the 3rd weekend of Spring Training (the busiest weekend).  More details follow ... Due to an incident my wife had at the ball game, I called in the afternoon and asked if we could move the reservation back from 7:00 to 8:00 pm - the gruff sounding owner answered and took care of it.  We showed up at 7:45 to find a line of people waiting.   I slipped past them and waited patiently for someone to assist me - they were very busy so it took a few minutes.  Finally the owner came by, I mentioned the reservation, and he confirmed we would be seated shortly.  Meanwhile several people in line were glaring at me and made comments to my wife about me \"cutting in line\".    The owner was seating the first family in line when 3 guys brushed past everyone, walked in, looked around, and sat at an empty table by the bar area.  When the owner saw that he asked them to move since the table was for people waiting in line.  We could see the discussion from the door and the entitled young men were not leaving easily.  The men finally got up and stood in the bar area right by the same table.    Starting to see a trend here?  A few minutes later the owner motioned to the next couple in line and seated them at that table,  He then motioned to us and sat us in a booth nearby.  As we were being seated, there were more comments from those waiting in line who had no reservations - \"how come they got a table\", etc.  People - make a f'ing reservation!  From our small booth we could see the front dining room and bar area as well as into the back dining room.  The place was packed with every table filled.  Service was humming and our waiter gave us the proper amount of attention.  We could see the 3 guys who were evicted from the table they illegally claimed - they were standing right next to the table and bumping the woman who was seated at the table.  She eventually moved to the other side of the table.  There were many other examples of poor behavior by customers that I won't bother you with.  Our waiter gave us recommendations on the wine and food - we listed to some of them and were not disappointed.  The food we got was delicious.  The wine was perfect.  The service was good.  The waiter answered all of our questions and was quite helpful.  At the end of the night I showed him my wallet - a cool one my wife found in NY years ago that has an old picture of downtown Scottsdale.  Our waiter identified the buildings on it for us and pointed out that the edge of the restaurant was right at the edge of the picture.  He knew the area well and grew up around there.  So in summary, it would have been a wonderful night if it weren't for the entitled people who came to Scottsdale for Spring training that think they can do what they want, eat at busy restaurants with out reservations, and be rude to others because as one guy that night put it \"I spent over $1000 to come here for the weekend.\"  So I would highly recommend coming here - I would just avoid the middle of March - when to bozos come out to play.  I rate the 4.5 stars - rounding up to 5 to slightly counteract the \"bad service\" reviews by people who seem to attract bad service.",

I have read other similar reviews so I know this is an ongoing problem with this man. It's a shame because the food was decent and the waiter was nice.  I do feel sorry for the waitstaff because they probably have to apologize a lot for the owner's despicable behavior!",

I had the spaghetti and meatballs, sister had Chilean sea bass with spinach ravioli and friend had chicken piccata. All of it fabulous. The bread and butter were awesome too. The salad dressings are so freaking good. I got house italian with blue cheese. Yumtown! The salad was fresh,cold and came with marinated onions of some sort. We all just loved it.

The owners and some of their employees are from the east coast, so be prepare to heckled, but in a joking and fun way.  Now to get down to the food. I must say that in my opinion,  Italian Grotto has the best Italian Food in Town (as far as Scottsdale goes). My husband and I discovered this gem just walking around Old Town Scottsdale. Luckily for us, we were in for a great surprise! As a newbie, we played it safe and ordered the Spaghetti with meat sauce. I never thought something so simple could be so good!! Along with your meal you get fresh baked bread with sun dried tomato butter, fresh salad with homemade dressing. Be careful not to fill up on bread before your meal comes, although its hard not too especially if you get an order of small clams or muscles portofino (white whine garlic butter sauce). Since the past 2 years i have tried enough entrees that i have narrowed it down to two favorite's..... White lasagna, and the Linguine with Clam Portofino! Don't forget dessert! Their Tiramisu is AMAZINGLY good! I have nothing but good things to say about this place. The staff are quick on their feet and aim to please! This place will be a long time favorite of mine!",

    "text": "By far the WORST dining experience I have ever had. I have never been treated more rudely. Came here today with my family to have a nice lunch while out shopping in Old Town. Three of my family members ordered the Baked Ravioli, I ordered the Manicotti, and two others got Fettucini Alfredo, and Spaghetti with Marinara. We were not given any bread, so we ordered some garlic toast for $6. Each of our lunch plates cost $8 each, and were a la carte. When our food came out, everything looked fine except for the ravioli. There were literally 4 pieces of ravioli on one plate. 4 small pieces of ravioli for $8. That's not enough food for one person. We had to make an extra order of the garlic toast for another $6 so the ones who ordered ravioli could have some extra food. I got two pieces of Manicotti, which was okay. My sister was upset, and decided to talk to management about the portion sizes. The owner of the restaurant came out, started YELLING, and saying that she didn't care, and that if she comped meals of everyone who complained to her, she'd be out of business. WOW. My sister said that they should make people aware of how many pieces of ravioli come on the plate, and she said, \"We never tell people that. You guys actually got two pieces of Manicotti and you were only supposed to get one, so that should make up for it.\" We were all very calm, and she kept raising her voice and being completely rude. She doesn't care about customer service. My family was visiting from out of town and this was our last day to spend together. We were just trying to have a nice lunch. We weren't asking for a refund, we just thought it would be nice if they could give more ravioli to the ones who ordered that, or at least comp the garlic toast we had to order just to give us more food. We paid $80 for that meal and everyone was still hungry when we left! They also told us after the fact that they normally give free bread before the meal, but they didn't do it for us. I have never been treated so rudely or had an experience like this before, especially not from the owner of the restaurant. I've eaten at plenty of restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale and never had an experience like this. I guess I will stick with Grimaldi's that's right down the road. Better food, and better portions, and the staff and owners are friendly and care about their customers and repeat business. Diana, you should be ASHAMED of yourself and the way you run your restaurant. That's exactly why on the day after Christmas, at the lunch hour, that your restaurant was mostly empty. The food wasn't even good enough for the prices you are charged. I've had better food at Olive Garden, and that's sad.",

I walked up to the host stand with my stroller ... Talked to a waitor and he said one moment then afterwords ... An older man with slicked back greasy hair walks up, slurping down water slamming it down and asked what it was I was doing ... I then proceeded to tell him I had been helped ... I honestly didn't know whom he was because he was sloppy and was not dressed as a host would be, anyways he then proceeds to be rude and tell me \"your gonna something and move out of the way\" and I looked at him as my blood pressure and hormones levels went up... The. Again says \" don't look at me like that I have 5 daughters don't be mad at me \" .... I literally have him a look but Honestly what business owner speaks to customers like that. My mother finally arrived to find me even more disturbed ... My 11 month old needed a high hair and they only have ONE... Not kid friendly at all!!! They made me feel uncomfortable for having to out my child in his stroller! Needless to say they have the table next to me the highchair and never offered it to me after the last person had used it!!! It ruined my dinner all together! My mother knew who I was talking about when I explained what had happened because this man whom apparently is from Chicago/ New York is a jackass to all his customers and even has had the nerve to tell others to turn there cell phones off as my mother explained that happened over spring training ... Just a side note from one New Yorker to another you make all of us look bad with your poor attitude ... You don't like your job get a new one!!! I didn't even want to spend my money at your establishment and your lucky my pregnant hormonal ass was craving your food or else I would have given you a True New Yorkers attitude ... I will never step foot in there after this experience .... If you have children I would advice not to go there as well!",

Cozy and full of life every time I've been, the Italian Grotto has a pretty good wine and beer list, as well as some amazing food.  WARNING: Don't fill up on bread! From favorites (and my favorite) Manicotti, to my boyfriends favorite Chicken Carolina, the Italian Grotto has a wide variety of entrees on their menu (which look like they are falling apart, but I don't mind!) that do not disappoint. The Manicotti was melt in your mouth good, and the extra cheese they put on top was like icing on the cake.  The waiters are always super nice and helpful, and the last time we walked in, the owner showed us to our table personally, which you rarely get at restaurants these days! When the weather is nice out, they open their side doors and push the tables out a little, so you can sit out and enjoy the air and people watch.  This is not really a place you'd want to go when you're looking for a quiet, intimate meal, but the dim lighting and cozy tables can feel quite romantic. If there's a game on, all bets are off though! We went there during March Madness and it was pretty noisy until the game was over (which we didn't mind, we actually came to watch the end of the game).   If I had to pick a place for Italian food in the Valley, the Italian Grotto would definitely be it.",

We were welcomed in and told that there were 2 seats at the corner of the bar. We sat and asked them what their on drink selection was. Since they were all over priced and we were just stopping by for a drink while we explored the area we ordered a beer each. I accidently bumped into a customer that was wedged in the corner eating dinner when I went to sit in the high top chair. I apologized to her and quickly we started up a conversation with this couple that was in their 50's. The manager rushes over asks the couple if they would like to move... okay weird. They said no. I wasn't trying to intrude on their meal or anything and they did seem interested in the conversation. As I turn back to the bar the bartender slaps our tab on in front of us. He said \"here's your check please pay and leave.\" I said \"Excuse me\" and he responded \"You are a waste of space at my bar.\" I was shocked! Never have I been treated like that or basically kicked out of a bar. I have worked in customer service my entire life and I definitely do not deserved to be treated like trash. I became infuriated as I responded \"are you serious?\" All he said was \"Leave\" and walked away from us. My boyfriend said, \"Let's just get out of here. This place sucks anyway.\" As we walk out I see the manager as he ushers us towards the door and I told him what happened and he said \"I'm sure this isn't the first time that you have been kicked out of somewhere!\" WHAT!!!!!! Seriously?! What sparked all of this? I like to have a good time, I am social, I love a good drink and great food! WHAT THE HELL! NEVER in my life have I ever been kicked out of somewhere and I cannot even begin to understand why I was kicked out of this restaurant bar. For god sakes it is an italian restaurant with carpeting! Yuck and the manager or owner what ever he is such a d-bag!  Plus he appeared to be drunk or on drugs or something. Such a weird, trying to be sauve, high on something, wanna be al pacino presence. How do you run a business like this and survive? I however cannot comment on the food since I will NEVER EVER go back there, but with such horrible discriminating service who would ever go there?! Save yourself the aggravation and do not help this jerk prosper with your hard earned money. What a fake establishment! They welcome you in to the bar from the street and then kick you out?

We told him we were waiting for a friend using the restroom and he told us it was for paying customers and WE SHOULD LEAVE. I thought he was kidding but since I was not sure we did the prudent thing and waited outside.  Now after reading all these reviews I can see he was dead serious. And THIS JERK was the one who seated us .  Your business will be appreciated more ANYWHERE ELSE!  This is the type of place that deserves to be out of business yesterday and anything I can do to hasten it's demise is worth my time.",

Took him up on the Chilean Sea Bass. We were very hungry and ate it tho salt was the primary flavor. Our friend ordered a dish with capers but it was inedible. I sampled it and it was saltier than ours! He told the server. The owner dude burst over and loudly exclaimed \"how dare you criticize my chef\"! He was going to remove this untouched meal from the bill but when noticed we had split the plate, he bellowed out \"what?! Only 3 meals for 4 people! Get outta here & just don't tip!\" Needless to say, the ruckus was over the top & we were aghast! With all the good choices around, we really were treated like garbage!",

    "text": "This restaurant looks like it belongs on the show Bar Rescue.   We were in old town late last night and looking for a place to eat. My father-in-law decided we step in to try the place. First impressions: The place is extremely dated and has an odd artsy/Italian feel. The waiting staff was nice and had good attitudes but they looked sloppy; shirts untucked, baggy clothing, etc. Our table was wobbly but our waiter got down on his hands and knees to put some towels under it to balance it out..  The menus need some refreshing and updating. We were handed paper menus with food stains and torn edges. The prices were ridiculous. Most entrees ranged from 21-34. We all ordered pasta, which was mediocre at best, and a whopping $14 per plate. I get that it's Scottsdale but come on, I could get far better tasting food at Olive Garden.  There was a gentleman sitting at the bar who I'm guessing to be the owner? Having a little much to drink, he was talking loud and flirting with customers while ordering drinks and refilling water glasses. Several employees were babysitting him during our visit attempting to control him. We won't be back.",

    "text": "Italian Grotto is a cute little Italian American restaurant. The patio is killer, and although it was a quiet night I can see that it would be an amazing people watching spot in tourist season. The service was attentive, friendly, and helpful with suggestions when my dining companions and I needed them (which we definitely did as there were so many tasty looking options!)   We ordered the Fried Zucchini Del Grotto to share, and I ordered a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. The zucchini wasn't bad, it was crispy and quite flavourful, and the dipping sauce was good but tasted like a re-purposed garlicky pasta sauce; once I adjusted to that I enjoyed the combination of flavours. The wine was ok - I wanted something American at least (I always try to have the most local wine I can get!), and was recommended the sauv; it was fine, easy drinking but not quite such depth of flavour as I was hoping for.  For my main I had the baked ravioli with pomodoro sauce; I was expecting something in a bowl, oozing tomato, covered in cheese and bubbled up in ooey-gooey happiness. My ravioli was on a large plate, which made it seem kind of small initially - but don't worry, it was incredibly filling! The ravioli was filled with a ricotta which contrasted really nicely with the melted cheese on top. The tomato sauce, however was way too rich for the dish - I was hoping for something fresh to stand out beside the greasy, delicious cheese, and instead it was too intense and I left half of it on my plate.  Having an Italian stepdad has made me fussier about Italian food than I'd like, but I'm trying! I liked Italian Grotto, but I'd still take a plate of homemade pasta over restaurant Italian food any day!",

Not even a small piece of French bread on the table?  We aren't drinkers, so had ginger ales.  Maybe that's the reason we were Rushed out? The waiter never asked us if we needed anything else, if the meal was good, etc. just threw the totaled bill on the table in passing,  the Rude owner/maitre d passed our table and we said we'd like the dessert menu.  He said our bill was already totaled, to pay it because he needed our table for  people in line. NEVER, NEVER, have we Ever been asked to leave our table, much less to accommodate other diners.  This person is the rudest excuse for an owner/patron of a business we've ever encountered.  We live in the S.F. Peninsula area where we have many upscale restaurants.  We also know our Italian dishes.  These lack any inspiration.  The chef just wants to serve as quickly as possible, didn't even detect any herbs.  Guess they depend on us using salt and pepper for some flavor, You know, if the service and ambiance is great, most of us won't complain about the food.  But, this place misses the boat in every way. Save your money.    $77.+ for 2 pasta dished, 2 ginger ales and a Small order of calamari.  And, Oh yes, plan to be tossed out if there's a line waiting to eat!   Never again!!!",

The homemade sausage was good but the spaghetti it came with was not very flavorful. It's hard to mess up anything with garlic and cheese on it and I'd say the food is decent but if you know how to boil water and take the lid off a pasta sauce jar, I'd recommend going for that instead. My ravioli experience was similarly underwhelming.  Both times I was here, I would've preferred a higher temperature on the minestrone soup or my pasta. It's possible that the secret to good food here is to order something other than pasta, but it's an Italian restaurant....  Ambiance is classic Italian place meets sports. The outdoor seating is adorable for more of a date vibe.  Service varies- I had one excellent server and one that ignored us basically all night. All in all, a mixed bag.",

When we walked in the manager or owner was eating a bag of chips at the front thankful he put a bag of chips down and sat us. There were four of us we all ordered main meals. I got a side salad with blue cheese which was not very good. My wife got the minestrone soup which she said was great. We ordered a side of garlic bread. The garlic bread was very good. I ordered the manicotti which the noodle was definitely cooked earlier in the day but the cheese stuffing was very fresh. I could tell the shell was cooked earlier because the ends were very tuff. My wife ordered the angel hair Primavera which she loved but also said was watery. The food came out very fast and the service was good. Overall we all enjoyed our food but the speed our food cane to the table and the service made it that much better.",

    "text": "I wanted to love this place. It's got a great outdoor dining area. I called and asked if they allowed dogs on the patio as we were traveling with our pup. They did. Pretty sure it was the owner I talked to and he remembered me when we showed up and got us a nice table. He was great.   I'll agree with the reviews that said the Halibut is amazing. My husband got it and it was well cooked. That's the only good part of the meal.   I get it's spring training and Scottsdale is busy, but our waiter was slow AF. I knew before I got there I wanted the Ribeye. I'm a steak girl, husband's an italian and seafood fan. Got the menu, there was a ribeye special listed and ribeye was a regular part of the menu. This was at 6PM I should add.   We saw a white lasagna that looked good, so we ordered it as an appetizer. I knew right then what kind of Italian resturant it was. It was covered in cream sauce and melted cheese, I mean... swimming in it. The flavor was so so, but there was enough cream sauce to take a bath.   Bread came next only after asking 3 times. There was a good 15 minute wait between the lasagna and the bread. Then our waiter took our order. I go to order the ribeye he says they think they are out of the ribeye. We ask if the other steak dish on the menu is with something other than ribeye. Nope. He takes my order and says he'll check but they were down to their last one. OK. I look for my backup.   I think we're safe as we don't see our waiter for another 10 minutes or so. When he returns he says no go on the ribeye and asks for my backup. I order the Chicken Colorado which is chicken sauteed with prosciutto and mushrooms. He says it's great.  At some point our waiter, I should add, the only waiter we saw on the patio all night drops a fried mozzarella dish on the table. It looks delicious, we both think maybe this is his \"sorry we're out of Ribeye\" plate. As he walks by like 4 minutes later, we tell him we didn't order it. He says weird, the kitchen told me you did. Um, how would the kitchen know, and you don't? Then he takes it off our table and he puts it on the right table... didn't ask if we'd touched it, etc.   All of the staff other than the owner appeared to be bored or maybe slightly high disinterested young men. Timeliness was not a priority. Apparently neither was accuracy.   Our dinners arrive. As I say, Hubbies Halibut was delicious. My Chicken Colorado is terrible it's literally rubber chicken drowning in a butter based sauce that I can't even dry off enough to get to my mouth. It's like in a soup with maybe a dozen pasta noodles under the rubber chicken.   Everything was drowning in italian parsley that tasted like it was dried and stale 6 months ago and everything was lacking flavor, but soaked in butter, cream or cheese. Old people Italian.   The location, the people watchiing, the owners, the halibut reasons to go there. Everything else, definitely reasons to stay away.",

I found everything from the food, most of the staff, to the ambience to my liking. I felt as if I were in an old school New York Italian restaurant.  The menu overwhelmed me initially.  Because I love Italian fare, it was difficult to make a selection. After the hotess described the house specials, I decided immediately.  I settled on a delicious scallops dish. The pasta and scallops were both cooked perfectly. I was beyond pleased.  The ambience: dim lightning with candles at each table, the warm interaction between the staff and diners, Frank Sinatra and Billie Holiday serving as the backdrop. Such fun!  Meatball, our waiter was very accomodating and a True gentleman.  My only issue: I would like to go back and sit at what seemed to be an ambly stocked bar; but the bartender was so loud and obnoxious that I wouldn't dare. In fact, when I return, I will ask for a table furthest from the bar in order not to hear him at all.",

I then proceeded to ask if I could get soda water instead of regular water. We will talk about that later.   It was weird as it is an Italian restaurant and the were playing 80's throw back music. During my entire meal the waiter and bartender sat right behind me and I had to take in their whole conversation. Not cool. We always kept our conversations in the kitchen.  The rest of my meal was ok and the meatballs were good. I was waiting to close out and get my check. The bill came and I said there must be an error, my wine was only $9 and this says $12. No, it is right said the waiter. Your soda water was $3.00.   I said you kidding Right? He said no it is $3. I said, you are charging me $3 For a .02 cent pour from the bar gun? Yes.   I won't be back. Someone is trying to pay their mortgage or pay for their kids school on my dime. It is such a rip off when people do that. I've been in this business a long time and that winds me up. If it were bottled sparkling, yes. It is sad because I finally tried this place out and had high anticipation.  #Rebelfoodandwine #vino2 #Vinosquared #Vino2ultimate #irishcatv2 #italiangrotto",

My buddy and I were in town for Spring Training and both agreed that this was the best spot to which we had been in 10 or so years making the annual trip.  He is a martini drinker and was blown away by the taste and abundance.  I had two glassed of fantastic Pinot.

The waiters both times were really good (attentive) but a little standoffish.  The food has been excellent though.  I took the waiter's recommendation of the veal carolina and it was super!  We will definitely go back and even will look forward a little to the pseudo feeling of being an intruder.  Oddly, combined with how good the food is, it is quite charming.",

I had been there several times and used to reccomend this place but NO way now. I told him that I would no longer support his restaurant with horrible service like that and his response was (in front of my guests and other tables around):  \"You think I care? Look at my wait, get the hell out. Go get laid and quit busting my balls.\"  I hope people don't support service like that because there are a ton of other restaurants in Scottsdale with better service and better food.....",

I read previous reviews & wasn't too sure how great our experience would be here, but decided to give this restaurant a try.  The staff here were awesome!  We got seated right away & service was top notch!  We immediately got served & all our drinks & food came out in a very timely manner.   We started out with a bottle of malbec wine for only $34, which we really enjoyed. Our waiter, Terrance was the excellent!  He recommended one of the specials which was a seafood medley of fish, calamari, shrimp, clams, mussels, & scallops in a cream sauce over linguine pasta.  I also had their soup of the day, homemade minestrone, which came with my meal.  Both were very good!  My friend had the clam rapallo: clams simmered in seafood stock, fresh garlic, herbs and white wine served over pasta. She had their house salad that also came with her meal.  She really enjoyed her meal as well.  The food was great, portion sizes generous, reasonable prices, nice ambience, friendly  & prompt service from all the staff!!! 3.5-4 stars on food quality, 5 stars for making our dining experience in Scottsdale memorable & great!",

The reason I can't tell you any of this is because my friends and I never got in. We arrived slightly early and spotted a parking spot right in front. Boom parking karma (Screeching brakes) until we can't fully pull in to the spot because of a drunken tweaker straddling the sidewalk. Should have tipped us off to how the evening was going to unfold. After sending ahead our low man on the totem pole we are told there will be a wait. Hey no problemo. It's 7:55 and we've got an 8:00 reservation. As we hang outside it becomes glaringly obvious this joint has no intentions of seating any of the folks who are waiting WITH RESERVATIONS. As we wait one of our group says he was tipped off to this place listening to a local San Francisco sports show. Lo and behold there is said morning show host Murphy(must be tough being named after a wedgie) blocking the front entrance and generally acting like a douche. Eventually we reached the breaking point and left when the host informed us that it would be a 90 minute wait from our reservation time. HA. The positive to the whole experience was the CD we bought off some dude outside while we waited. It had some awesome beats and the legendary track 7 titled \"Who the F**k are you?\" came in handy when we circled the block and bumped the radio to 11 while letting Murph know he is a tool. Hey maybe next year I'll actually get inside to try some food.",

I ordered  garlic bread and fettuccine Alfredo pasta with vegetables. It's very difficult to screw up Garlic bread but I must say these guys will do the impossible - my garlic bread was hard as stone. When I pointed this out to the server, he got the manager / owner who defended the uber hard exterior of garlic bread. I understand that these breads need to be crispy but one more bite of it and I would have gone straight to my dentist to undo the damage caused by this garlic bread from hell. Next on plate was the fettuccine Alfredo pasta. I actually checked under my table to check if there was dead animal because the smell of this entree was unbearable and it had way too much sauce in it. At this point i decided to just sneak out of there because I could not convince myself to pay for this utter crap that these guys label as Italian food. Do not go to this restaurant!",

A nearby Giants Spring Training Game had just concluded so we were very fortunate to have had reservations. Apparently this is a favorite spot for baseball fans as evidenced by the sports themed decor.  The place was packed and teeming with activity. You would expect with all that chaos the service would be a bit sketchy, and understandably so.  Nothing could be further from the truth. Before we had a chance to sit down our server came by to take our drink orders.  All evening long, that same server was spot on. He was taking 6-7 customized orders at a time returning in less than 5 minutes with everyone's drinks.  I also noticed a large 10 top cleared out right next to our table and I saw a bartender, the owner, our server and a busboy all over there cleaning everything up and re-arranging the tables for the next guests. Amazing teamwork.   The food was very good.  All of the appetizers were great, particularly the fried calamari with spicy marinara sauce.  The regular bread in a basket was a bit dry for my taste (I prefer more chewy as opposed to flaky and crunchy), but their garlic bread was pure heaven.  For my main course I had the spaghetti with meatballs, one of the best in recent memory.  It had just the right amount of spice.",

You can't beat the price for the culinary experience in the area, not to mention the social aspect and people watching at times.  I can't tell you how many times I passed by this place over the past 8 years and never stopped in. I had no idea what I was missing out on until earlier this year, when I stopped in for a dinner party with Jesse J. and some friends.  It was only at this time that I realized what this place really has to offer.  From the Sausage Parmesan, to the Chicken Carolina, to the Veal Scallopini, I have yet to try anything that wasn't up to my standard of excellence. The Mussels Portofino are amazing, not fishy tasting whatsoever. I am always skeptical of Shellfish in AZ, and usually not a fan of Mussels, but they have been fresh on every occasion here. The same goes for the clams, they are as fresh as can be. The house vinagrette that is served on the salad before your meal is tasty, and i can guarantee that you won't find one leaf of brown or wilted lettuce in your salad. :)  As for the bar, Chris the bartender on the weekends really adds a nice touch to the place. He comes off as being down to business and straight to the point, as you would expect to encounter on the east coast. He will crack a smile once in a while and will chat it up with you it you start the conversation. You will often times see Gary, the owner walking around making sure that all of his guests are being properly taken care of.  The decor in the place really illustrates how long this place has been around, and when you try the food or chat with Gary or one of the other old school staff members, you will feel like you have stepped into an NYC hole in the wall Italian Joint for the night.  Whether you're looking for a great meal at a reasonable price with a laid back, yet classy atmosphere, or if you're just passing by and grab a drink at the bar, it's a sure bet that you will leave with a smile on your face, and maybe a little history on the place or the town.  Treat yourself to an old school piece of Scottsdale history and have a nice New York Italian Style meal at The Grotto.",

They say award winning calamari and I see why I honestly don't like calamari usually but I went to town on this stuff.  The marinara sauce is spicy and full of flavor just an amazing way to start a meal.  For my entree I got the Chicken Cutlet Parmigiana which was awesome.  I have to thank the yelpers for the suggestion on that one they were all right it was fried to perfection and the pasta and sauce on the side was excellent.    I wish I had room for dessert as I am sure they are good but my wallet and stomach had enough for the evening so I will have to venture back again very soon.

Theme of the night seemed to be Guy's Night as there were several, SEVERAL tables full of middle-aged men who insisted on hooting and hollering as me and my friends walked by....   It was HOT in this place. I'm not talking sexy, though I did have to take off my jacket to keep from overheating. The ambiance was lacking and I realized quickly that this place was not my style.   Service was fast, but felt a little rushed. The server wasn't very engaging but again was on the ball and quick. He, at times, took plates prematurely before we were finished and without asking.   The bread came out warm and well, fast. As did our salads and our entrees. The salad was great considering it was just a simple side salad. I think the Italian House dressing is what really impressed. I did ask for dressing on the side but instead received it doused to the point that I had a large puddle of dressing in the bottom of the bowl after I ate all the leafs.   I ordered the Cannelloni Florentine for my entree which was pretty good but a little dry. My friends all enjoyed their meals for the most part but none of us were wowed.  Prices really range at this place. Page 1 everything is under $13, turn to the next page, everything is $20+. I could never justify paying $20+ again for mediocre Italian food regardless of it's toppings. I can't imagine I'll be back.",

This place seems to have a high turnover rate - Follow the orders - Sit, Order, Mingle, Eat, and get the heck out cause someone needs your table!  You know, after a plate of carbs I would like to sit for some time while my digestive system works, but apparently they don't have time for that.  Our server was pretty cool and fun so kudos to Meatball for making it a fun dinner experience regardless - Enjoy!",

    "text": "In a nutshell: This restaurant has the rudest staff of any restaurant I've ever eaten at in my life.   I came here on a beautiful New Years Day afternoon, with my boyfriend and my dog. Before sitting down, I asked one of the servers on staff if it was alright for me to have my dog sit down by our table while we ate. She's fifteen years old and was on a leash at the time, which I explicitly said. He said it was absolutely fine, no problems whatsoever, so I went to seat myself at the very end of the patio, furthest away from all the other tables so as to not disturb any other guests who might come along - it was totally empty.  About fifteen minutes later, while my boyfriend was in the bathroom, I gave my mom a quick call since she was wondering what time we'd be getting done eating. In the middle of my conversation with her, I heard someone talking loudly and aggressively next to me, so I looked over, and he was staring angrily at me. I asked him what he had said, and he acted like I had affronted him. So he even more angrily boomed, \"I SAID GET OFF YOUR PHONE, NOW. AND MOVE YOUR DOG, NOW. PLEAAASE.\" I was utterly confused, not just by his psychotic rudeness, but by what he meant by that. My dog was laying at my feet under the table, not in anyone's way at all. He started talking about how it was HIS table and HIS chair and I had better get off the phone and was waving his hands and pointing at the chair where I had tethered her leash, all while my mom was talking to me in my ear. Very disorienting. But finally I understood that he wanted me to tether her to a different chair, even though there were 40 other empty chairs around us he could have used to seat the couple instead. In fact, the table they were being seated at already had two chairs. Bizarre.  I very calmly told him that he didn't have to speak so rudely. He starting going off about how I have no idea what I'm talking about and I don't respect anyone else's space and I was taking up two tables and it's his chair so he can tell me what to do with it. Since I had finally hung up, it clicked, \"Oh, this is your restaurant?\" I was totally baffled how someone who actually wanted to run a successful establishment would treat his customers like common criminals. \"YES, MA'AM. MINE.\" That was all I needed to hear. We immediately left.  I'm in total shock. This guy has an axe to grind with his customers.",

The owner who seated us didn't say one word just walked us to a table and pointed. I ordered Chicken Parm.. $21 for a piece of chicken and some sauce and cheese. Okay, I understand it is Spring Training and all but come on. We asked for some more bread and they finally brought it out after the 4th time, yes 4th request. Just not worth it. Got the feeling they didn't care and just wanted to turn the table quickly. So, save your money and head tobMaggianos up Scottsdale Rd. Tastes much better and 1/2 the price!",

Staff is running around like chickens and every once in awhile you'll hear a cuss word or two. Service was not good, salad was gross, my chicken piccata and fettuccini Alfredo had no flavor and the pasta was under cooked. If I rated the Italian food from 1-10, it might get a 2.

    "text": "This recently became my favorite Italian restaurant ever for so many more reasons than the food.   We walked in and were greeted by who I can only assume is the owner (an older Italian gentleman wearing a Yankees jersey) and seated in a booth. Frank Sinatra was singing and we were surrounded by pictures of past and present Yankees players (The Yankees are my AL team because I have a need to be severely anti-Red Sox).   Our waiter, Brandon/Meatball, was super friendly and never let my water glass get anywhere near empty. I love that.   So now on to the food, which was absolutely amazing... My mouth still waters just thinking about it. Our app of choice, garlic bread, was some of the best ever. I had the Chilean Sea Bass special - the fish  was cooked perfectly (and I'm not usually a fan of cooked fish) and the spinach ravioli it was on top of was amazingly delicious.   The only way this night could have gotten better is if I had been with a date who was drinking so that I could have drank as well. A nice white wine would have complimented the fish wonderfully.  As we were leaving, Steppenwolf started playing. How can any experience associated with a \"Magic Carpet Ride\" not get 5 stars?",

I am not the pickiest eater but this food was the worst food I've ever paid for in my life. I ordered the eggplant parm (or some variation of one) and got a plate 2 tiny sliced eggplants, a lot of what looked like soggy canned mushrooms that tasted awful, 10 pieces of rigatoni that didn't taste fresh, an entire can of tomato sauce which was awful and very watery in some parts and a little slab of partially melted cheese of some sort. It was also not hot. It was so unappetizing and disgusting, but since I was paying $21 for it, I forced it down. It was not filling, not good and extremely overpriced. We ended up paying $48 for 2 entrees. We didn't order any drinks or anything else. Should have gone to Buca di Beppo which is a chain that I can trust and would have paid $25 for two to get good food. I will add that service was great; the waiter was very attentive and friendly and food came pretty fast. Wish I'd read some reviews before wasting my money and meal on this place.",

    "text": "We went last night despite the poor reviews. We like to make up our own mind. Unfortunately, the poor reviews were being very kind. The food was beyond bad. I am vegetarian so I ordered the spaghetti marinara. They basically heated stewed tomatoes and dumped them on pasta. Zero flavor, zero effort. My salad was equally terrible. Iceberg lettuce topped with about a pound of blue cheese dressing. My wine tasted skunky, like the bottle was opened the previous night and re-corked. The \"garlic\" bread, seemingly had no garlic, only cheap bread completely drenched in butter. The calamari was breaded and fried and had no seasoning, including salt. It came with \"marinara sauce\" that tasted tinny like it came out of a can and was heated up. I would call it tomato sauce - which is an  ingredient, not a finished product. If I am consuming that amount of fat and calories, I like it to be worth it, and it was not. Our bill was $87, and my boyfriend said it should have been half that and even at half price he would not have been pleased. I agree with him. I will never understand why people with no passion for food get into the restaurant business. I guess they just rely on the business of unsuspecting tourists who they know won't be back anyway. Disappointed and angry, quite frankly... Feeling ripped off. If you like fifties music, are from the midwest, and frequent the cracker barrel, you will find it quite chic. The music selection made me want to put a bullet in my head.",

That same finger told us, dummies, to wait for minutes next to the table while it got cleaned. But it was a different finger that kicked us out of the restaurant for asking the owner - who happened to also be our waiter - to repeat something he mentioned from his improvised lunch menu. This was the middle finger, which he flipped at us along with a healthy dose of swearing and insults in his determination to make sure that we would never again return to his glorious establishment for our terrible misconduct. But that particular finger came out only after our table was swept away from us in a fury of hate and madness as innocent bystanders watched in horror. We exited the restaurant in silence and humiliation for our contemptible actions. Never again would we stand up for our right to repeat what a waiter says - lesson learned! And never would we receive the honor of trying one of the Grotto's legendary food offerings.   Confused? Then my review has served its purpose. My feeling of confusion lingered on that day, and only after my thought process finally cleared a bit did I start to comprehend the fact that this was undeniably the most repulsive restaurant experience of my life. Thanks to the Grotto, my standards for restaurant service have sank to the bottom of Mariana's Trench! In retrospect, since this episode, I am actually really enjoying visits to very average restaurants. My ultimate recommendation to fellow Yelpers: when your standards for restaurant service become impossible to satisfy and you see yourself handing out a bunch of 3 star reviews, do yourself a favor and pay the Italian Grotto a visit!",

The Alfredo was deliciously creamy, not bland like so many other places.  The chicken and its sauce were very flavorful, as well.  I would recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a delicious meal and not looking for the typical \"downtown Scottsdale\" experience.

    "text": "What a nice little restaurant.  Located right on Scottsdale Road in Old Town, this location offers a nice little Italian opportunity.   The restaurant reminds me very much like a neighborhood restaurant.  There were many at the bar that would appear to be regulars enjoying the happy hour and games on television.  But other seating options offer a nice choice from a quiet booth to window seating that looks out toward the street.  Although too hot to open the doors, I am sure that they would open them during cooler times.   Meals included the Sea Bass with Spinach Ravioli.  Very good.  Other reviews comment that it melts in your mouth and they are correct.  My friend had the Veal Sorrentino which looked amazing.  Desserts are limited.  We had the Tiramisu and Chocolate Chip Cannoli, but very good.   Wine list is limited, but the selection is good and pricing is very reasonable by the bottle.   It will be slightly pricier than your chain restaurant, but it offered a very nice experieince for an extended evening meal and conversation.  Amazingly, it was not very busy and we were able to enjoy an extended dinner and conversation without feeling that we needed to rush out.   Would recommend it and will definately keep it in mind for a nice change.   4 Stars only because there really needs to be something special for me to award the 5th Star.  Probably just missed it tonight though!!",

Who knew it would turn out to be a great secret, hiding right in front of my face.  Boyfriend and I were in the old town area and decided we wanted Italian for dinner. Saw the good reviews on Yelp and make a beeline for the place. Thank you fellow Yelpers for steering us in the right direction yet again.  The place was busy but we managed to get a table. It's a little crammed but it kinda adds to the experience IMO. The waiter was very attentive but not pushy, which I like. I ordered the white lasagna and boyfriend went with the cheese ravioli. We both chose the soup to start.  The soup was delicious. I knew that if the meal was as good as the soup, this would be a great dinner. The portion was huge and the soup was loaded with yummy veggies and was very flavorful. The bread that came with it was yummy, crusty french bread - perfect for dipping in soups and sauces.  My white lasagna was really good and REALLY rich. If you're on a diet, do not bother ordering this dish. The white lasagna is layered with ricotta cheese, mushrooms and spinach and then drowned in alfredo sauce. No, I'm not kidding. It came in a bowl.  It was kinda like lasagna alfredo soup. And it was awesome!!  Boyfriend loved his cheese ravioli too. Also a large portion, covered in sauce. He came pretty close to licking the plate.  If you want a no frills, casual, basic but amazing Italian dinner, I highly recommend Italian Grotto. I look forward to eating there again.",

Would recommend asking for his section as he is pretty cool...looks like he could be in a very Italian film.  Highlights:  - Seabass done Picatta style with a side of vegetables - Homemade vegetable minestrone soup (hmmhmm Good!)   Overall, this was a great place to eat and have a good conversation. I would say the ambiance is slightly lacking, however, the food makes up for any flaws. Don't get me wrong, it is a nice place to bring a date...just a little dark for my taste...black decor.  Price: 2 entrees and 2 glasses of wine...$80 not including gratuity. Each entree comes with a salad or soup. There is a split charge, however, for the $5 you pay to split each person gets either a soup or salad.",

Then came our waiter, which was very nice and pleasant.  The dinner salad was a nice size and the minestrone soup which was strongly suggested was good. The sauce on the while lasagna was bland, I couldn't add enough salt and pepper so it could taste like anything. My kid loved the spaghetti and meatballs.   Overall, the service was great., the atmosphere was classic. I am not sure if the food is worth trying again. There are so many places to eat in the area and great reviews, it makes it difficult to find a place that really has your same taste.",

    "text": "Depending on the wall you face in Italian Grotto, you will notice either SF Giants loyalty or NY Yankees loyalty. Similar to their baseball loyalties, the food quality can swing in either direction depending on the food you order.   First was the fried zucchini del grotto which some of the best that I've tried. Their bread was just too cold and the salad had mushy cucumbers & tomatoes. I had the clams portifino, which was just mediocre. I tried a bit of the Eggplant and Mushroom Parmigiana, which was so good I wish I ordered it myself.   Most of their entrees were around $20 which feels high considering the quality. Most pastas were around $10. The pastas are clearly the better value especially since they include soup or salad as well, but they generally have no meat which was an issue for a carnivore such as myself. The place was very casual with the bar being most laid back while the booths in the back had a more romantic ambiance.",

Lettuce that was in huge pieces that you couldn't eat properly, and a few tiny onions, and nothing else. Prices outrageous for the poor quality food. And waiter...don't pour wine in customers glasses just to finish the bottle and then ask if we want another bottle. Inquire before you pour, maybe I don't want more wine and now that it is in my glass, others can't have it. One star is too much!

As our server arrived; one of our guests asked for a $50 bottle of wine yet we were told to \"pick up the wine list and tell what we wanted\". But we knew the name.  Then numerous guests at our table were told we were not sitting directly in front of our napkin/place settings.  At this point we asked if we were inconveniencing him to be there and asked to see a manger.  The short gentleman approved and was so rude and condescending to us.  He stated he was a manager but we later found out he was the son of our waiter.  We immediately left; but was followed by the servers son and was cursed and flipped the bird.  I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.  Don't waste your time.  Once we realized we were speaking with an owner and she had to tell the gentleman faking as a manager to stop staring and threatening us to leave our presence, that is when we realized its a poorly managed establishment.",

    "text": "I have never written a review before, but after a restaurant experience like this one, I felt as though it was necessary. Myself and 3 others came here after our finding out the restaurant we originally wanted to go to had an hour wait. Honestly, we would have been better off waiting an hour for that place. Our worst decision of the evening was choosing this restaurant. We were seated right away, but didn't receive our actual meals until an hour later. We received our appetizers fairly quickly, but 30 minutes went by after that and we hadn't heard anything about where our food was. Servers were coming out of the kitchen left and right with everyone's plate but ours. Our server then told us that they were backed up. It wasn't that busy in there at the time, and it sure didn't seem like they were backed up if everyone around us were getting their dinners. We even saw people sit down after us, finish their meals, and leave! We stopped another waiter and asked what could be taking so long, and he said they were just busy. We waited, and waited. The man who sat us seemed to be the owner/manager of the place, so we got his attention and kindly asked if he could check on our food because now it's been 40 minutes since our appetizers. He preceded to argue with us and say \"I know when I sat you, and I sat you 20 minutes ago!\" I've never had the owner of a restaurant basically call us liars and talk so rudely to us. How he could stand there and say that in a stern voice to us when we were the ones sitting there looking at our watches the whole time - I'll never know.   The management was just terrible. That is $15 I'll never spend on a meal there again. We were thrilled to finish our food and receive our checks. Hopefully they'll read the note we left on the back of our receipt..but I have a feeling they could care less if they ever see their customers twice because they get a lot of one timer tourists. Oh, and their bread was extremely hard and cold. Awful experience.",

    "text": "This was a great place to end the night.  Let me provide background: 6 of us girls went out to dinner (at Furio) for a lovely Girls' Night Out. After dinner, we wandered north down Scottsdale Rd looking for a place to sit, chat and get a drink (or two).   When we hit Italian Grotto, one of my friends said, \"Oh, this place has the best margaritas.\" It happens to be a favorite spot of her father's, and we peered in - it looked perfect.  They seated us enthusiastically, and the entire place was oozing \"NEW YORK.\" It was great. Our waiter was friendly, nosy, and flirtatious. Great for a group of married women out for a night. :-)  I wasn't sure what I wanted to drink. I told him I wanted vodka, but not a vodka tonic, but nothing too sweet .... He said, as he walked away, \"you're having a Mandarin Press.\"   Well, OK then.  Our drinks arrived, and I loved mine. Mandarin vodka with Sprite cut with club soda. It was fizzy and yummy and not too sweet.   A couple of the girls ordered an Appletini and the Cadillac Margarita (pretty strong drinks), so when two of us polished off ours earlier, the waiter came back with replacements (another Mandarin Press for me and a Gin & Tonic for another girl) and told us they were \"on him.\"   The music they played was great - jazzy and classic. The bar had rows and rows of Yankee bobble-heads, and the 3 flat screens above the bar featured basketball and baseball.   I think we sort of closed the place down. It was 11:00 when we started to think about leaving, and the place was emptying.   It was exactly what we were looking for - a nice big round booth great for conversation. Perfect ambiance for the low-key end to our evening that we loved.   I would go back in a heartbeat.",

We were a group of 6 and we were told each meal was $8. Obviously there was something wrong. We asked to talk to the manager and our waiter said \"he would do anything to pocket some money\" and \"you don't want to talk to him \" I have never been to a restaurant and been denied a solution to fix our problem. I was absolutely horrified. Turns out as we were in a rush to leave my aunt left her shopping bag there and we went back to get it. I've heard from other people that he has stolen their things too and has given it to his wife. He even stole something from an older lady and when she asked for it back he threw it at her. At this point we were all furious and we just wanted our things. 100% would not recommend as this place was by far the worst service I have ever seen.

My other half had the special which was halbiut over linguini with a lemon butter sauce with capers . He said it was outstanding and finished the whole thing . I enjoyed my food as well . We split a fluffy, decadent piece of plain cheesecake with chocolate drizzle . Overall I adored this restaurant . Our server was on point . Only reason for not 5 stars is because it was 75 for 2 people at lunch. The only lunch specials that were provided was different types of salads... Not pastas or specialty dishes. A smaller version of some of their pasta dishes would be nice and more affordable . I will definitely be coming back but for DINNER! Lunch is just too overpriced .",

My favorite meal: I start with the Zucchini( pan fired with a lite batter and amazing white sauce) Then move on to the soup ( Amazing Minestrone) Then have the Chicken Carolina (Every bite melts in your mouth) Or the Sea Bass Picatta( Soo good) I Finnish it off with a White Chocolate Tartufo or a Cannoli.   Complete the meal with a nice bottle of wine in one of the tables that opens to the sidewalk and you have the perfect evening.  Not the cheapest place in the world.

If you visit this gem of an Italian restaurant, there is only one thing you must order. The Chilean Sea Bass melts in your mouth. It is well seasoned with garlic, pepper, herbs and possibly crack (I am salivating just thinking about it). The generous portion of fish is served atop a bed of linguini noodles and some sort of cream sauce that could have been alfredo... But if it was, It was the best damn alfredo I have ever tasted.  The service is quick but not rushed... The full bar makes a stiff drink. It is everything that a small independent restaurant should be and more.

    "text": "This place looks pretty interesting from the outside, a cute building with an old fashion appealing sign. However when you get inside you get the sense that this place is sports bar that has been converted to a restaurant. There are TV screens playing sports loudly, a dominating full bar and some small tables. There is nothing Italian about the interior, and this is where I should have walked out. But I didn't. The first thing I asked was if the fish was fresh and was told by a tough looking actor/ waiter who was pretending to be an New York Italian and called himself \"Meatball\", said that it absolutely was. I ordered Sea Bass and my wife the shrimp. I guess when he lied about the fish being fresh, he did not know that I am a fisherman and also I cook what I catch. The seafood is Frozen, Frozen, Frozen. Not just frozen but badly thawed out. The shrimp was still cold inside. Meatball, the \"want to be Tony Soprano\" had lied.  Before we ordered, he also tried to up sell us the Garlic Bread. Which we refused and were punished with a stale sourdough.  I think they forgot to tell these guys that Italian restaurants serve Italian bread -DA  There is nothing authentic about this place, from \"Meatball\" who I guarantee you is not Italian and probably got kicked out of Los Angeles for being a bad actor, to the Sports bar interior.. I felt that next week they could be selling hamburgers. There are lots of good restaurants in downtown Scottsdale, Buca Di Beppo, a chain across the street, is even better, Uncle Sal's also in Scottsdale is way, way, way superior and cheaper and has a much nicer atmosphere. There is no reason to spend $30 on an entree at this dump, when so many other places, like Girmaldis and Uncle Sal's give you so much more for the money.   So I made three mistakes that night.  1. I walked into the Italian Grotto 2 We believe the Meathead named Meatball when he said the fish was fresh 3. We didn't complain.  But when the food is bad and the place stinks, the only way you voice your opinion is with your tip. So I left a tip of approximately 12.5 % on the bill. I usually leave 20% but I felt ripped off already.   Get this - \"Meatball\", the Meathead approached me as I left the restaurant, held up the bill with the tip and said to me, \"Did I do something to wrong?\" Where the hell does he get the audacity to question me about my tip? A tip is a tip, it is not necessary and when your food stinks you should get none, in fact I should have gotten my money back on the gruel this place serves. I was extremely offended by Meatball and made my way quietly to the door without a response. Well Meatball must be taking his gangster act a little too seriously because he followed me out the door and watched me walk to my car, giving me the evil eye the entire time. My wife almost said something to him, but there was no upside in it. That is why we have forums like yelp, so when business, like the Italian Grotto mistreat customers we have a voice. Thank you Yelp[",

Now I've come for years, but food quantity has diminished of late and they have earned the coveted FRANK B middle finger award.  I've dined on any items throughout the years and my father keeps insisting on eating at this rat hole.   (Oh Cheers to the person who posted cockroach  photo, you rule!)  Today is the last time I set foot in this dump. My meal today was Sausage Parmigiana with spaghetti. So I get tiny slivers of uncocked sausage with a dab of marinara and some cheese ( and not even a full link if that). For $21 I should have gotten two links and cooked with cheese baked on. The spaghetti was cold and I'm basically put my napkin on it and didn't eat it.  So FRANK is pissed off and hungry.  In the past the food was OK but this owner claiming to be from NYC should really go back to LITTLE ITALY and learn how to cook Italian food. John's on 12th is a good place for him to be a busboy to the Restraunt business.",

My friend ordered the Cheese ravioli.It was store bought.It tasted like an angry meetingt of salt and garlic.The sauce was Broken,rubbery Alfredo.It was something a drunk frat boy would make after a night of beer bongs and high fives. The calamari was soggy.The servers all seemed drunk.One of the waiters wafted a giant path of Marijuana smoke to our table...He had just gone outside and smoked weed and brought the cloud back to the table with him.

    "text": "Pretty middle of road Italian spot.  The food is overpriced for what you get - I assume because it is in such a prime Old Town location.   We sat in the back near the entrance to the kitchen. The ambience was..eclectic..to put it nicely. I feel like the paintings and oddly silver finished walls just didn't fit together. It didn't help that the place was dark, dingy, and a bit dirty (especially in the hallway near the kitchen and in the bathrooms). Some touristy food locations upsell you for the ambience .. we quickly learned this wasn't one of those places.  The food wasn't terrible. I went with baked cheese-stuffed ravioli. The sauce was great and the portions were good. I have to note that my starter salad was put together pretty oddly. They basically just dumped a huge dollop of blue cheese on top of a few pieces of lettuce and called it a day. A little bit of a rip of and just lazy service in my opinion.  Server was a bit pushy, but I wouldn't say rude. Overall, timely service and he didn't mess up anything. He actually ran out of the restaurant and chased us down the street because I forgot to sign the receipt - oops!  Our bill came out to close to $70..for 2 glasses of house wine, garlic bread, and 2 of some of the cheapest pasta dishes on the menu!  Sadly, after our mediocre experience and after reading  tons and tons of the other negative reviews, I do not think we'll be back.",

    "text": "This weekend, my wife with our baby and my wife's parents were in Scottsdale and attempted to eat at this restaurant. My wife and her mother first went in to see how long the wait time is while her father waited in the car with the baby. When she went in and asked what the wait time was, one of the workers, we assume was the owner, didn't answer and just walked back into the restaurant. He then returned and started to wave my wife and her mother back to a table for 2. She stopped him and explained that her father was in the car with our baby. Then he says, \"No, no, no.\" She asked, \"What is your wait time for 4 people?\" Again, he replied, \"No, no, no.\" She asked about the open seating on that was on the patio, which was enough for 4 people. Again, he said, \"No, no, no.\" At that point she says, \"Oh, now I get it. You don't want to serve anyone with a baby.\" To that, he did not reply. She and her mother left and returned to their car which was close to the entrance of the restaurant. They then witnessed a group of 4 people (without a baby) go in and we're promptly seated at the same table she asked about on the patio. So tonight I call and asked to speak to the manager. The gentleman who answered the phone asks how he can help me. I then reply, \"Are you the manager?\" Without saying yes or no, he again asks how can he help me. (Im guessing he was the owner.) I proceeded to tell him about my wife's encounter this weekend. Before I even finish my sentence, he interrupts me and said she didn't have a reservation. (I got the feeling he knew exactly what incident I was talking about.) I asked him of he told her that she needed a reservation. He just repeats that she didn't have a reservation. I then explain he started to seat she and her mother but when he found out they had a baby, he refused her service. Again to this he says to me she didn't have a reservation. (Keep in mind his tone during this conversation is very rude and disrespectful.) I then try to ask if they have a policy against serving parties with babies. Again he replies she didn't have a reservation. He then tried feed me some BS about spring training and they are really busy. I tried to ask him again if he told her that she needed a reservation and he then hangs up on me. I call back and someone else answers. I asked him if he was a manager he said he was just the guy who answers phones. I start to tell my story to him and he then hangs up on me. Needless to say, we will not be going to this restaurant ever again and we will be sure to tell everyone we know about our experience and how they treat families with children.",

The ambience was very dark and smelled of sanitation. The restaurant just smelled old and rank.   The food was terrible. The salad had old pieces of red cabbage, the dressing was sour and vinegary. The minestrone soup tastes like leather. The entrees were huge, and for the price they should be. However. The quality was so low and I smelled my fishy pasta from when the server came out of the kitchen. I had a seafood medley of 1 large old shrimp, 1 ok scallop, a bunch of old clams and mussels that smelled and tasted terrible, and calamari that was ok. The pasta noodles were fine however, the quality did not match the price.  I think this establishment needs to really refocus and read all these reviews and make a change. Italian Grotto is in the heart of old town, and people from other states and countries come to eat here and leave with a bad impression of AZ.  This place needs a major revamp and as is, this restaurant should not serve to the public.",

Given that I had to deal with them through our whole poor experience, I did not believe that any gratuity was warranted.  Hence, I signed the credit card bill for the amount of our final corrected check without including any amount for gratuity.  What was processed through the restaurant to the bank was for $20 more.  Sure when I called the bank they took care of it but what these clowns need to work on more is how to improve their service instead of fraudulently mischarging customers for their horrible service!",

    "text": "While walking around Old Town Scottsdale we came across this place and it looked interesting.  The gentleman at the front door boasted that the place has been at this location for over 40 years.  So we decided to have dinner here.    The waiter was nice, not friendly (and that is okay with me, I am not taking him home, so I like that he was not trying to be over friendly.)  He asked us if we wanted appetizers and we said no, because when we eat appetizers we never finish our dinner.  After we placed our dinner order he asked us if we would like garlic bread, either plain or with tomatoes & cheese on it and we replied \"yes the tomatoes & cheese sounded good.\"  The bread was soggy and I could tell the marinara sauce was from a can, it had a YUCKY metallic after taste.  A different person served us our dinner.  He was very pleasant but he was wearing a light gray polo shirt that full of stains all over the front. (I noticed this immediately because we were sitting next to the window and it was 5:00 so the sun was shining bright into the restaurant.)  This totally turned my stomach to see how dirty his shirt was.  Wearing a filthy shirt while serving food is completely unacceptable, especially when serving food in a \"fancy\" overpriced restaurant.  The least management can do for their employees is to supply them with clean shirts.  Our dinner was okay, not the best we have ever had but we were okay with the taste of the food.  When we received our bill there was an extra charge of $8.00 on it.  When I asked the waiter what it was for he said it was for the garlic bread.  I told him that the way he presented it to us, he made it seem as if the bread came with the dinner.  His response was \"Well I said \"if you want you can have...\"  That was wrong on so many levels, he was purposely upselling his food.  THAT makes me angry, you should never trick your customers into buying food they don't want.  Why trick your customers?????  I posted on FB that we were trying a new restaurant so several people asked me how it was.  Apparently this place has a bad reputation.  There were 2 people at my office that said they too had a similar negative experience at this place.  I am pretty sure all the positive reviews here are NOT legitimate reviews.   Also, when we were leaving we noticed the person who was at the front door when we initially found this past (who we believe to be the owner) was YELLING at the person who was working at the store next to him.  That was so unprofessional.  I will NEVER go back. Our advice is to go somewhere else.",

Yes, we know the food has always been mediocre, and yes, we know the owner's a wingnut, but we enjoyed rubbing elbows with the baseball people that used to hang out in there, and we actually liked the owner's frequent tantrums - it was like a free floor show.  But the place is way too far gone now.  The food is inedible (came out cold, tasted like poop, stale bread, salad was a bowl of plain lettuce), the ladies' room was an absolute cesspool (and the Mister says the men's room was awful also), and the food we had went right through us - our reward for our loyalty was a night spent taking turns running to the bathroom.  And there's more - when the bill came, it was handwritten in illegible scrawl, and it seemed a little high.  So we broke it down item by item, and found our server threw an extra $20 on there for good measure.  Asked him about it, and got a red-faced stammered apology about how he \"confused our check with another table.\"   Bullshit.  The Mister and I both work in the service industry, and we know scumbaggery when we see it.    Finally, to cap off the last memory I will ever have at the Italian Grotto, we saw the owner actually rinse out used bar straws and put them back in the tray on the bar.  Have never seen anything like it in my life.    We used to look forward to our annual visit, but it's over for us - we're done.  They have completely given up in there.",

Next, the server placed his fingers all over the rim of the glasses when delivering water. Fast forward to dinner salad that appeared to have come out of a bag, which may have trumped my buddies Caesar salad that had no Parmesan cheese or croutons. For the main course, we bring you a pile of gristle known as veal Marsala. And for your entertainment pleasure, acrobatic servers carrying loaded cans of refuse right through diners at their tables, en route to the trash bin.  Luckily for this place the health inspectors were otherwise engaged for the evening.",

The men's restroom was disgusting! It was absolutely filthy, the urinal didn't flush, the entire room needed a good bleaching. How does this place pass a Health Department inspection? I sure hope they put a more concerted effort into cleaning the kitchen. Won't be back.",

    "text": "I apologize in advance for the length of this review, but if you are ever planning on being within a 100 mile radius of this place, I would recommend that you read it.   It was my grandfather's birthday, so we decided to go to old town Scottsdale to have a nice dinner. He felt like Italian food, so we decided to try this place out. At the door, a man was greeting guests. Later, I realized he was the owner. He seemed nice at first, assuring me that he was getting a table ready for my family. We were seated and the first noticeable thing about the restaurant was the noise level. The waiter was literally screaming at our faces to get our orders. And I though HE was rude???! Things were somehow about to get wayyyyy worse.  Even though we were 6 people and a baby, we only ordered 4 dishes. My grandparents always share, and the baby can't exactly eat a full plate of lasagna and garlic bread. We started our meal with Minestrone, a \"vegetarian\" soup. I found a piece of sausage in my soup, which I cannot eat. It's not a big deal, but at that point the soup was inedible. The owner was passing by, so my father got his attention. He told him about the sausage and explained that we could not eat it. Instead of apologizing, this dude started lecturing us. \"Stuff happens! I've owned this restaurant for 38 years and you expect me to be perfect? NNOO!\" All I wanted was a simple \"S-O-R-R-Y.\" Do people not teach that word to their toddlers anymore? It certainly wasn't in this guy's vocabulary. So, after he left, I exclaimed \"Excuse me!\" to my family and we began talking about how rude his behavior was. This guy, who I assumed was a waiter, heard me and we made eye contact. He then walked away.  A few minutes later, the owner returned. He then decided to give us another condescending lecture. \"Well I saw your ticket and you are a party of 7 who only ordered 4 meals! I'm just sayin'. The soup is not a big deal- it happens once in a blue moon! Tomorrow is a new day and the sun will come up! I'm not gonna kill myself tryin' to make you people happy! I want to live a long life! BLAH BLAH BLAHHHHHH\" My grandmother asked him if he was going to bring me another soup. He then, in a very patronizing tone, asked me if I wanted another soup. I refused, since I was almost finished with my soup when I discovered the sausage anyways. He then went on to say \"I have 6 kids! I know that you need more food. Tell me what to bring and I'll bring it for you. You only ordered 4 meals. DOES ANYBODY HERE WANT A SOUP!!?!? \" I have to say, I feel bad for those kids. They probably get whipped on a daily basis. He left after we all refused, as the waiter I mentioned before smirked. We had had enough. We decided to leave while we still could. As we began to exit the table, the waiter saw us and realized what was happening. He came by and asked \"Is everyone leaving here?\" We said yes and continued to leave. \"I don't like being insulted like that,\" my father told him. \"Oh yeah?? Insulted? You only had 4 meals on your ticket! Now that's insulting! You can't even afford enough food to feed your family! This is MY restaurant! I'm done with you people! GO- GO! Keep moving! GET OUT OF HERE!! STOP THEIR MEALS!\" he yelled. At this point, I was worried that he was going to get physical. I decided this spawn of Satan could only be the owner's son.  We continued walking out of the restaurant, our jaws hanging open.The owner was at the door greeting his friends and regular costumers (how does he even have any of those??)  He then started yelling at my father! \"You can't even afford seven meals! I'd rather you people leave!\" Now, my father was mad. \"I'm a cardiologist! I can afford a meal! Do you expect the baby to eat a full meal???\" The owner replied, yelling and following my family as we turned from the restaurant, with \"A cardiologist? Oh, and I'm an astronaut! I'm going to the moon tomorrow!\" This dude certainly seemed high enough to get to the moon. \"Just don't end up in the ER!\" my father said.   I was shaking after this incident. This dude needs to be in a mental hospital. His son can be his cellmate. I have a weird feeling he's going to send the mafia after me after he sees this review, but I don't really care. I need to preach out to people DO NOT GO HERE! THE OWNER IS A CRAZY LUNATIC! RUN WHILE YOU STILL CAN! I seriously hope this place burns down. It would make the world a much better place.",

    "text": "Who are visiting from Southern California. We drove to old town Scottsdale were looking for place to eat. We saw a sign outside a restaurant that said \"we have here since 1977 and we must be doing something right\". We looked at the menu posted outside the restaurant  and decided that it was okay to go in and eat. We walked in and the place was empty. We were seated and given menus.  When we looked at the menu I realized that the menu we had  been given did not match the menu outside. The menu we had been  given had prices that were double the ones on the outside menu. I asked the waiter if we  could be given the menu that  outside. He just told us that certain items on the menu we had were 8 dollars. He  never gave us the menu outside. When we were ordering our meal my son asked if you could add shrimp to Alfredo. The waiters that said that he could not do that.  I told him that we were going to pay for the shrimp. The waiter responded that he would have to charge $17 for the extra shrimp. We said thank you but no thank you. When he brought our meal  to the table he asked if we wanted cheese. We said yes and as he was poured cheese on our food he also sprinkled it all over the table.  Food was okay. We will not be returning.",

    "text": "Cheers to some real Italian dining in Old Town! I can't believe I don't dine here more often. It's one of those restaurants that you kind of forget about until you're walking by it after dinner and think \"oh yeah I really need to go there sometime!\" Last night we finally remembered to go here and I'm glad we did!   Italian grotto is some authentic Italian dining that's owned by a group of Chicago folks. It's homey, warm, sports fill the TVS above the bar, they make sure you leave as stuffed as can be and the environment is great. Every walk of life dines here, whether it be a couple on a romantic date, a family of tourists dining here after a ball game or a large group celebrating a birthday. The restaurant isn't huge but it's not tiny either. It's exactly the size you'd expect an Italian restaurant to be.   The food here is some delicious, fatty Italian. Forget about counting your carb intake here because you will soon loose count! The meal begins with soft and fresh sourdough bread with vinegar and olive oil for dipping. We tried the mozzarella marinara which was fried mozzarella. How can you find anything wrong with fried cheese? I sure can't. Every entree comes with soup or salad. I tried the homemade minestrone which was delicious. It came in a huge bowl though and I couldn't even try to finish it, but I definitely enjoy several tasty sips! For my main meal I ordered the chicken carolina which was a very large chicken breast covered in more mozzarella as well as mushrooms and sitting on a bead of pasta. Like I said, the carb-count is out the window for this meal! Everything they serve comes in huge portions so sadly I could barely even make a dent into my chicken either, but every bite I had made me want to push myself to take another one! The entire meal was food-coma worthy and sadly, we were too stuffed to try their homemade triamisu. Next time though!   If you are in Old Town and looking for some lively Italian dining, head straight to the Italian Grotto and afterwards, go a few doors down to the Rusty Spur for some live country music and drinks!",

I didn't really think about it until I got outside, thinking that the lunch I had bought was a bit too expensive, while rechecking the lunch menu posted outside. I had already paid for my meal and left. He had definately raised the price on my lunch meal by $5.00!!!  There seems to be somekind of SCAM going on over there. Maybe the owner wasn't around...",

    "text": "I have been having an internal debate for a few weeks now about how detailed of a review I wanted to write. I have decided that although I am not excited about wasting more of my time on this horrible establishment, but if I can keep them from making money off of at least one unsuspecting patron, I have succeeded. I will keep it relatively brief because my experience was not much different than most of the other one star experiences complete with rudeness and threats.  We were hanging out in Old Town one evening after spring training and decided to stop in. We walked up to the host stand and a line quickly started forming behind us. As my friend and I were wondering where the host was, the gentleman behind us (from another party) informed us that they never have a host and we should beware because when someone does show up, they will be very rude. Weird, we though. I asked his why he still came and he told me, \"for the food.\" \"Well whatever\" we thought. We shall see for ourselves. He was right about the rude part. We never made it to the food part and I don't care because my hard earned dollars won't go to support such an awful family (it is apparently a family owned business).  The owner eventually stumbles up with his glass of wine. My friend says \"excuse me, we have a party of 3,\" to which he replies smugly, \"yeah I see that...\" Shortly thereafter, a server walks by and as we try to get his attention, he purposely ignores us.  Um ok.  Next, a server comes up to use the credit card machine. My friend says, \"excuse me but we have not been helped yet, is there a host?\" To which he replies, \"look, if you were sitting in my section, I would help you out, but you aren't, you are here. So you aren't my problem.\" Charming.  Rinse and repeat with a third prince charming who says, \"whaddya want me to do, it's busy, etc. etc. [insert a few more obnoxious comments here]\"  So now that my friend has been treated disrespectfully 3 times, I'm pretty irate and grace our resident jerk with a few choice words of my own. (hey, I'm not proud of it but well.....he deserved it). He looked shocked at a lady standing up for herself and wouldn't you know the big man threatens to call the police. I asked him to please do so (loudly and with an obscenity), but he declined.   At first I thought that this was rudeness combined with an utter lack of respect for women. I do think that is True, but it goes further, as it does not seem that they have respect for any of their customers. However, if you can read all of these reviews of behavior that would be unbelievable if it weren't for the sheer QUANTITY of similar reviews, and still donate your cash, I would not respect you either.",

We called ahead to see if we can make a reservation, they told us there aren't any reservations available, but the walk-in wait time is only 10 minutes.  Upon arriving (5 minute drive), the front desk person told us it would be at least a 30 minutes wait.  Fine, maybe a few large parties decided to show up between the time we called and when we arrived.  After 30 minutes, we were finally seated.  After being seated, we waited another 15 minutes for a waiter to stop by with water.  It took another 10 minutes for him to come back with the water and the menu for us to order.  By then, we have waited for a good 30 minutes before putting in our orders.    We ordered fried calamari and zucchini, spaghetti w/ meatballs, sausage and peppers, and the shrimp scampi.  The waiter somehow messed up our order where our entree came out first without any appetizers.  After 10 minutes, we asked about the waiter to cancel the appetizers as we were already finishing our entrees.  The waiter said he would check, but came back with our appetizers 10 minutes afterwards.  To summarize our experience:  Good: 1. Great location, in the heart of old town  Bad: 1. Poor management - misjudged/misspoke wait-time just to get more business 2. Slow Waiters - it takes him at least 10 minutes to come back to our tables.  Took over 30 minutes to put in order despite us asking to order 3. Bad waiter attitude - even after making the mistake of not putting in our appetizer, the waiter would not own up and cancel our order.  Came back 10 minutes afterwards with our appetizers when we already finished our entrees 4. Mediocre food - everything was extra salty  Overall, would not recommend anyone coming here.  So many other places to go with better service and food.",

    "text": "Ok, so we came in after seeing how cute the spot looked, great location,  etc.  We asked the owner where to check in to be seated.  He rudely told us to just stand there and he'd get us seated.  Eventually a very kind waiter seated us.  The waiter was sweet, his name was Tony.  I had an enjoyable appetizer (calamari) and salad. Then my entree came (chicken parm). I won't lie,  my food was all tasty.  However,  as I  (luckily) almost completed my meal, my cheek was stabbed and I pulled a staple out  of my cheek.  Not a little staple that you use in the house, but more like a staple you'd see in a carpet or similar.  A thick, sharp staple.  I told my waiter.  He was shocked and brought it to the owner.  Immediately I had the owner say \"fuck her I'll buy her a cocktail\".  He came outside to the table and with an immediate nastiness asked if I own a kitchen or have ever washed a dish.  He said it was clearly from a steel sponge. Now I do in fact own a kitchen,  and I cook and clean for my family daily.  When I clean a dish, I not only wash, but also rinse them.  I have never had to pull a piece of steel from someone's mouth.  But believe me, this was no piece of sponge.. but a STAPLE.  The waiter continued to apologize.  I said I understood but after his response and lack of concern (owner) I would gladly pay our bill, minus the entree that the staple was in.  Oh, the owner also nastily  asked if I was injured, as if to imply I was being dramatic by bringing it to my servers attention.   When I said \"well I did take it from my cheek\" he yelled \"so is there a hole in there?\".  I mean.. Nasty. Anyways, the waiter went to presumably tell the owner I was surprised at how he handled it and he immediately started screaming, cursing at the waiter, etc.  He ran out, yelling at me telling me he would take $10 off (whooptie  doo) and I had 2 minutes to pay or the cops were being called.  After the bill was paid, I heard him inside saying how he has 5 daughters so he is used to bitches... mind you, I was very respectful as hard as it was and maintained composure and a respectful tone throughout.   On my way out I kindly said that I pray his daughters wind up with men more respectful than him and I told him he was a disrespectful disgrace.  He continually yelled for me to get away from him, as if I was a bother. And literally closed the doors in my face.  It was so insanely rude, it was comical.  It actually made for a great night and hilarious story, but the man clearly isn't right in the head.  He seems to be a very sad, pathetic, insecure man.  And he is lucky my sister and I dined without our husbands as he would have been laid out on the street for talking to a woman like he did had they been there.",

Just after entering the men's room, the owner banged loudly on the door and demanded for me to leave - immediately! I own businesses and travelled the world and have never been treated so rudely.

The food was delicious. Each of us liked our dish so much that we shared with each other and argued over which was the best... we never decided on which one won. Because we were discussing how much we all like minestrone soup, Harvey bought a bowl for the table so we could try it. It was delicious food and such genuinely good service.   I highly recommend this place if you're looking for an Itilain restaurant in downtown Scottsdale. It's kitchy and has a feel that's not too fancy, but the food and service feel as if you were in the most upscale of places. Fantastic.",

    "text": "As a small female, I was assaulted and slandered at this rough and tumble, unsanitary bar by an employee and the owner.   I was so excited to eat at the Italian Grotto in Scottsdale with my husband. He had talked about the ambiance and the great food when he ate here the previous year when I couldn't attend with him. Well, we finally made it there (I'm from Ohio) on March 22 on a very busy night, to be fair. I was facing the bar and watched the owner pick up two dirty water glasses and a used napkin from a bus tray and wipe the rims of the glasses, refill them with more ice and water, and serve them to another table. As I watched, my husband kept saying, 'What are you looking at?' I said 'I will tell you outside.' The owner saw that I had seen him, and came up to our table and asked about our meals, as a way to change the subject. I said nothing about what I had seen.  The next day I was out shopping around 2 p.m. and went in to use the restroom, wrongly assuming that since I had eaten dinner there the night before it would be OK. As I stood in the middle of the dark room, a huge bouncer barreled his chest into my backside and  asked what I was doing there. I said I wanted to use the restroom because I had eaten there the day before. He said, \"Where did you sit?\" I pointed to our table and he said, \"That's a lie. I was here and I don't remember you. You are a liar!\"  At that point, the owner approached the altercation and asked what was going on. As I tried to explain, he talked over me and said, \"There is a reason we don't allow people from the street to use our restroom.\" I told him I had eaten there the night before, and he and the bouncer nudged me toward the exit. Together, one on each side of me, they yelled to the passersby on the sidewalk, pointing their fingers at me, \"This lady is a liar. She is liar! We don't allow liars in our restaurant!\"  I went back to the hotel and told my husband the story, in tears. I am a professional women, well-dressed, in my 50s and have never been treated like this at an establishment. I question the tone of the place. Is this the way everyone acts in Scottsdale because it is a baseball town? Obviously, I will never go back to the restaurant and I am re-thinking whether Scottsdale is the place for me to spend my money.",

Upon 2 minutes of being at the establishment, simply asking if the Golden State Warriors game was being played, the owner of the restaurant told me and my younger brother to shut up multiple times and threatened to fight my father and spit in my mothers eye. The bouncer blamed it on the owner being in a \"cranky\" mood. Cranky or not; telling minors to shut up and threatening to fight your customers is completely unacceptable. And on top of it, according to a couple locals after the exchange; it is shitty and overpriced Italian food. If you want to pay a lot for bad food and to be harassed then this is your place! Legitimately the single worst restaurant experience I have had in my entire life.

Most of the non-chain restaurants are located around here and if I had more time, I TOTALLY would have wanted to explore Old Town more!!  Italian Grotto is a cute restaurant with waiters that don't really smile except when you're on your way out the door.  There was no wait here on a Wednesday night around 7:30!!   Here is what I ordered: 1. Calarmari - It was okay. More fried batter than there was squid, but the pieces that DID have squid were good. THe batter is not too heavy and is fluffy like tempura batter..no that was decent.  2. Garlic Bread - for 2 slices for bread drenched in garlic butter, $8 was a hefty price for what it was. too buttery and not enough bread!  3. Eggplant/Mushroom Parm - This dish was a disaster. It came out with a side of spaghetti and the eggplant mushroom part of the entree was wrapped up in a shitload of cheese. It was, for all intents and purposes, a cheese pocket with ridiculously thin slices of eggplant and 7 pieces of mushroom shoved into it. It wasn't even good cheese..it was cheap cheese that was cold when it reached the table and similar to pizza cheese that had been refridgerated overnight. Blech.  4.Tiramisu - This is the only reason I would ever return to this restaurant..it was AWESOME! I like the tiramisu where it is like biting into a sweet coffee cloud. I would come here and order 5 slices of tiramisu next time because this was the only part of the meal that impressed me..  2 stars for the tiramisu..hip hip hooray!!",

I like balsamic so I won't go further with that complaint... The chicken Marsala was not so good. What happened to sauteing the mushrooms? They were still raw. As if the chef had hoped the steam from the over-cooked chicken would do the job!  Not very impressive... Maybe I'll go back when I'm not so sober.",

The server suggested wines and appetizers .  The calamari was cooked perfectly with a spicy marinara sauce. The fried artichoke again perfect with an Alfredo sauce. Because of the size of our party he made each 1 1/2 the size.  We had 5 different meals so we could sample each other's food. He split one chicken dish for $5 and each got their own salad. Each was prepared to our liking - fish, 2 chicken, 1 shrimp , 1 Ravioli (this could have been bigger).  Too full for desert we ordered one to split. This turned into 3 to share (for no extra cost)        We asked for the owner to thank him for the recommendation and a great experience here. We had a great conversation. He ended up sending over his special cordial for us.   Highly recommend this place.",

Lots of personality in this place.  Very east coast feelings in most ways. The decor was OK. Probably not what I would expect for a place that is somewhat pricy.  I got a glass of red wine. A very very modest size glass I would add.  I doubt a 4 oz pour. My  wife got a basic cocktail.  All was OK really.  Bread came out and it was white bread and butter. Ok....how can you mess that up. We got a zucchini appetizer. Again...not bad, but not thrilling. Was served with an Alfredo sauce, which I thought was a little strange.  Again, very modest portion size on that.  I got the pasta Bolognese and my wife got the cheese ravioli. Pretty good...nothing to write home about.  The ravioli was a really small portion. I think it came in a salad bowl.  The location is awesome.  It's easy to run up a bit of a bill here.  They've been around a long time. People must like it.  I'm more neutral on it.  Considering the restaurant choices in Old Town, I'd probably try something else next time.",

The fried artichokes were simply delicious. And very hearty. I could have eaten this alone and been happy.   There is a small outdoor area. Which gives you a good view to be able to people watch or to have people watch you eat. And indoors the decor was filled with sports memorabilia. The bar area had TV's for your viewing pleasure.  All in all, not a bad little place.   *note the woman's restroom was pretty clean too*",

Needless to say we quickly left for better prospects.  After reading some other reviews here, apparently this was the owner!  I just wanted to reiterate how incredibly impolite and ill-mannered the staff at the front door was, and I shudder to think of what service must be like inside.  I would avoid this place at all costs, and I honestly can't believe they are in business if this is how they treat prospective customers.",

I guess I was attracted to the cute baseball mitt chair at the entrance and all the baseball banners, not to mention it was hot outside and wanting to grab a drink.   We walked in and took a seat at the bar. The bartender was very nice so this 2 star review is no way in reflection of him. He's the only reason I gave it the extra star. But there was this grungy manager (probably the owner) that was yelling at all his employees. I mean really cussing them out in front of all the customers. It made us feel so awkward and we wanted to just leave our drink and walk out of there (which we eventually did).   Then when we were walking out there was an older couple, probably in their mid 60's early 70's that were walking in. The manager/owner said \"where do you think you're going and basically discouraged the couple from coming in. Again super awkward and we just wanted to get the heck outta there. I looked at some of the reviews after and it seems like that's common practice for this guy. Terrible service!",

The food was barely ok, but the service was unbelievably horrible.  The waiter took our order, then 1 minute 30 later one person asked to make a change.  He complained that they were already cooking it, even though we had not received apps or salads yet.  He then said, I took care of it for you.  Our entrees came out 45 minutes later and the waiter never changed the order instead he said the kitchen was already cooking the salmon... when I reminded him of the order change, he said too late unless you want to buy the other entree also then walked off.  I flagged down the manager/proprietor who also complained but said he would take care of it.  To his credit he corrected the order, but complained the entire time. The waiter with the bad attitude and horrible customer service never came back to the table until we flagged him down for the check.  I am guessing they get away with it since it's located in a tourist area of old towne Scottsdale.  Too many good restaurants to waste your time and money and a place with terrible service.",

We had reservations to eat there that night, but before even hearing us out he got in our face with a very condescending tone asking if we could read the \"bathroom is for customers only\" sign on the front door. Another costumer actually chimed in telling him that it was not right turning her away like that. Anyway, when he finally shut up enough to hear that we actually were customers, he gave my husband a complementary shot of whiskey to make up for his mistake. Guess that's just how they do it in NY lol. I'm sure they get walk in traffic asking to to use the bathroom all the time and are obviously frustrated by this.",

    "text": "Well.... I am not sure where to begin but this place was very entertaining for all the wrong reasons. I will begin with the atmosphere, to say the least, it's dated but I think that's why it's so charming. It reminds me of one of those classic Italian restaurants you hit up in New York. The food was decent, I think the portions were a bit modest and the plating could have been done better. However, I want to point out the perfect Meatball I had with my spaghetti, it was delicious! Now the service is one of a kind, the place is always busy so the owners and servers are quick to get you in and out. Don't expect to be here a while before they decide to throw you out. We witnessed quite a scene between the owner and customer. It was quite comical! Some yelling, throwing of towels, F bombs, and some serious caddy behavior. The customer was being irrational and extremely rude as well. Not that they deserved that treatment but you get what you have coming I guess. The owner is a no BS kind of woman from New York I'd assume.   Overall, if you're looking for good meatballs and some sassy service then I'd recommend this place.   There is this place in Chicago where the service is absolutely awful and rude but that's how they advertise there business and I will say the place is always crowded. People like the show that they put on. Perhaps the grotto should run with it and possibly meet the expectations of all the other reviews.",

We were walking through Old Towne searching for something to eat for dinner and the smell of butter and garlic pulled us in as if we were in a trance.   The owner was very friendly when he greeted us at the door. The restaurant and bar were busy but seating was immediately available. And despite the fact the place was packed full of Giant fans the vibe was upbeat, pleasant and a place I could see revisiting on future trips to Scottsdale.   We started with some garlic bread and Minestrone. You better be a fan of garlic to enjoy the garlic bread. It was a bit overwhelming, but being a fan of the flavorful bulb this did not deter me from eating almost half a loaf. The soup was smooth. A nice tomato base with noodles, veggies and beans. It was not in itself something to write home about but provided a nice start to our meal.   For the main course we had Scallop Scampi and Cippiano. Both dishes surpassed expectations. The seafood was fresh and tender. Pasta was a perfect al dente and again there was not a lack of butter and garlic complementing the shellfish and pasta.   Dinner with drinks was a bit pricy but it's vacation. We enjoyed the meal and will certainly return on our next trip to the Valley of the Sun.",

You can tell this guy cares more about his pride than customers. He was rude, disrespectful, and lost a customer. I headed to Brat Haus and order from that trusty place instead  Don't waste your time with this place, there are better Italian choices in Old Town",

The indoors is beautifull I feel like I'm in Boston's North End with all the authenticity of the food.  Indoor European Italian ambience makes this place 5 stars.  I prefer indoors although the patio is seriously nice.   The food is a good price and truly amazing.   No sparkling water needed here this 100 percent GOOD !  I studied at Le Cordon Bleu and the ratings for Italian Grotto on Yelp is not deserved and am surprised of the lack of respect for the old world!  Knock Knock puddin heads.  This place is Amazing!!!!!!",

Me and my room mate just about walked in the front door and a heavyset guy I think who had facial hair around 5'10\" immediately walks up to us and asks if we were looking for the bar we said no we would like to get some food. He immediately walks us out and says let me give you some recommendations. We were extremely confused as to what was going on. We asked if we could eat there, he said no. So I asked if they stopped seating for the night and he asks where we were from. We said we just moved to town. I then asked what time do they stop seating because I was assuming that they were closing for the night. He replies \"whenever we want\" me and my friend are still pretty confused about the rudeness and the awkwardness in the situation and I say ok I get that but when do you stop seating on future nights so we could come back and try the restaurant and his reply was \"don't come back!\". As I sit here in the next restaurant we decided to go with I'm still extremely confused as to what just happened and it seemed like this guy was the manager or owner. Now that I see this places reviews and it is a 2.5 star with a lot of reviews from people who actually got to sit down and eat I'm pretty happy I didn't waste my money there. Well sir, we won't be coming back and I will be letting as many people as possible know about how you treat your customers!!! DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!!",

    "text": "WOW. Where do I start. We made the unfortunate blunder of eating at this restaurant this evening after a spring training game. We were greeted by a very friendly guy outside on the corner who worked there and told us there was no wait. So we thought we would give it a shot.  Nice atmosphere in this place. People drinking having a fun time seemed like pretty friendly staff. Then our waiter arrived to our table. MAN!!! What a creeper. He seemed to be high on some kind of narcotic , blood shot eyes. Didnt really introduce himself either. Explained nothing about the menu or any specials if any. By his overall demeanor and attitude seemed as though he was doing us a favor by taking our order. He also was wearing a baseball   cap too. He was very laps in filling waters and being over all attentive.  For the food. GEEEZ. We ordered the Fried calamari and by the looks of the portion I would believe our stoned waiter may have dropped half of it on the floor on the way to our table.It was some of the smallest scrap pieces of calamari I have ever seen!! Very bland too!! It was maybe 13 pieces very small too. the spicy marinara that came with it for dipping was pretty good so I thought \"maybe this is not a total lose here\". I was WRONG!!!  The salads came out with watered down dressing (blue cheese) and the salad had no flavor or texture. Throw in a crouton or red onion for some bite!!! Uneven chopped tomatoes too. It really looked like it was thrown together given the fact it came out 2 minutes after our calamari came to the table. (the portion of calamari was so small that we still pretty much finished it anyway) but still it seemed very rushed. And another waiter sarcastically said \"seriously?\" when we turned down parm cheese on the salad. As the only salad I put parm cheese on is a Caesar salad. Not a house salad with blue cheese.   Entrees , what a let down. I ordered the Veal Parmesan. It had no flavor the texture of the veal was very chewy not tender. The sauce was ok but not as good as what came with the calamari. They served it on a bed of rigatoni and there we maybe 8 pieces of pasta too. The breading on cutlets were not seasoned and the was not browned enough. The cheese was barely melted as well.   My girlfriend ordered the \"white soupsagna\" yes I said \"SOUPSAGNA\" as this white lasagna was a 3 layer mess swimming in a sea of alfredo sauce. The flavors were better then my veal . But again the portion for the price was sub par. It mostly was floating in this alfredo sauce. I can tell it was not baked. The noodles were strained in the colander , layered with the ricotta and DROWNED in the sauce. It did not have that signature resistance standing up to your fork when you dig in that you normally feel. It kind of just fell apart . The layers were very loose and soupy. Our bread was pre cut and must have been sitting too as the outside was getting stale.   I cannot believe this place has gotten the kinds of good reviews it has. Maybe it was what we ordered? Or an off night? But so many things missed that I cant believe this place has been serving scottsdale elite as long as it has.  I know Italian food. I am Sicilian, from New York and have studied Italian culinary cooking at schools in the city for years. I have eaten at Carmines and Raos in Manhattan. Dan Tanas in Los Angeles. These are good restaurants!! I know good italian food!! This is not it. You may be better off going across the street to Buca di Beppo  LOL . If you are in Scottsdale I would recommend Veneto Trattoria for italian.",

All the previous reviews about the so-called \"owner\" (or the guy who just looks like an old white disheveled vagabond at the front who likes to yell at and about people that come through the door) are absolutely spot-on. I should've read the reviews before coming to this place...please learn from my lesson and do the same if you're even thinking about coming here. Will never go back to this S&&Thole!

Our server was accommodating and he had back up support to help with his tables. The restaurant was well prepared to manage the larger crowds due to Spring Training and Spring Break.  The food portions were very satisfying. We shared the fried artichokes as an appetizer and shared the chicken parmesan roll. Even though we shared a meal they gave us two small house salads. We were both completely full after our meal and unfortunately did not have room for dessert.   I'll definitely eat here again on future trips to Scottsdale.",

The wait staff even pulled out the table so we could ease into our table.  Our server was Harvey and he made every effort to keep us well watered and fed. We started with house bread which came with butter and I think seasoned cream cheese (or butter) with sun dried tomatoes. Altogether I'd say we had four servings of bread.  Next came clams in portofino sauce. That was promptly scarfed down by our youngest.  Then came mozzarella marinara. Each piece was individually served.  My wife had chicken Carolina, the daughter garlic and butter spaghetti, and the sons pasta bolognese and fettuccine Alfredo.  I had the eggplant Parmesan. It's weird that it has mushrooms but you can't even taste them. But you can feel the texture. And it was great.  We were hungry but left full. Only regret was we had no room for dessert.

Three entrees and I sampled all of them. The marinara dipping sauce was heavy with tomato paste and not at all a good marinara.  The clams swam in a broth so salty, it made my lips swell up like a pontoon boat. The fried calamari and artichoke were fried to a delicious, white coloration which, in the realm of fried foods, was about fourteen hues down from golden brown. This created confusion in my already befuddled mind. Was it cooked or wasn't it?  I Had to take a bite to solve the mystery. Unnerving.  I ordered an antipasto for two thinking I'd go light with meats, cheese, and relishes. Another huge disappointment. It looked like a salad with two buried slices of capicolla deep within and two, also buried, slices of salami. The remainder of the bowl was small bits of red and yellow peppers, about thirty pepperoncini, but mostly romaine tops. This was anything but a traditional antipasto, with the majority of the bowl comprised of lettuce. I don't know why IG hides the meat and cheese, but it pissed me off.  I felt like the catcher in a game of hide the salami. Literally!  I had to ask for bread since the antipasto was a bust. This made me feel like Oliver Twist begging for crumbs, and for no good reason at $12.95. The only thing good about this place was nothing.   I suspect they've remained in business all these years primarily due to their location, and all the unknowing tourists.  Never going back.",

He succeeded in ruining our night and obtaining a large sum for food we did not eat because we were so offended by his behavior.  I do not often wish I'll will upon another person. But this man is despicable and I hope you will not support this business.   **the waiter Will was lovely, however",

We randomly showed up here because we wanted to go to the waffle house but it was packed (2 hour wait... yea not happening).  So italian is a good go to for me to try so we stopped here.  We parked in the back streets.  Nice place to walk around.  The waiter was really nice, I think he must be related to the owner or is the owner since he was not dressed the same as everyone else.  We had the bread and olive oil, it was not super strong olive oil but it was pretty good, and some really nice parm to go with it :)    We also go the garlic toast, wow it's strong stuff, i loved it but if you don't like super strong garlic with a sting, stay away.  The Shrimp Del Grotto was very good, a bit overly salty, the guy actually noted that it looked darker than normal, it wasn't to the point of not good so I kept it.    The Scallop Scampi was also very good, nice big scallops, even the picky lil girl liked them.  The calamari was pretty good as well.  The butter for the bread (which they serve normally, you have to ask for the olive oil) is a bit too solid, but it is some kinda red pepper butter and tasted good.  We did show up here on a Sunday around 2 pm, so it worked out that it wasn't too busy, the bar was hopping cuz there was some game going on and a lotta cheering which breaks that whole dark romantic mood lol.  Talk about conflicting message from teh same place but overall a place I'd go to again.  It is pricey though fyi.",

After standing there for a moment ( they WERE NOT BUSY!) he said seat yourself ! We wanted outside. Chair cushions disgustingly stained. We were the only couple on patio. I went to use ladies room. IT WAS DISGUSTING! Horrible urine smell! Our water glasses... mine was DIRTY! Still had someones lipstick & finger prints!!! My husbands had big chip missing on bottom! We pointed it out to waiter he brought 2 fresh glasses this time my husbands had black stuff floating in it!! I ordered a house red. IT WAS Especially warm as if left out in sun! Husband had a beer. My bread plate I pushed aside it was filthy on edge & bottom! We decided to pay for drinks and leave. Out waiter overheard us and spouted out \" that will be $14.00. I WASNT EVEN TALKING TO HIM! We approached owner to tell him our dissatisfaction and he started yelling at us ! He was so busy yelling when we tried to speak he dismissed us then said \" lady what do you want me to do get on my knees\" WE WERE SHOCKED AT HIS BEHAVIOR! So if you want a GREAT ITALIAN meal go a few blocks down the road to Miller and eat at Pasta Brioni!!!! Went there after leaving that dump in Old Town! Amazing service and AMAZING food and great prices!! The Grotto is a disgrace to Old Town Scottsdale!",

I like the atmosphere of Italian Grotto. It's not too spendy, I love that the walls open up onto the sidewalk allowing for fun people watching. The last time I was there with my husband we sat at the bar and enjoyed watching some sports on tv while we drank and noshed.  This is a welcoming place to go when you want something fun and not too too god damned fancy,  I knocked off two stars for a couple reasons. I made reservations a couple weeks in advance and nevertheless we were given a crap table by the kitchen. We could have waited for another table, but we were hungry and wanted to get on with our evening. If you have a reservation on the books, try giving a non-reservation party the table by the kitchen and save that upfront table for the people who called ahead. Also, our waiter seemed a little out of it...despite the fact he was friendly he just didnt always seem lucid. He had a hard time keeping our order straight both forgetting one entire entree and refusing to split our entrees between three people (although he happily split them between two?).  The price for a bottle of Veuve was extremely fair. $90.",

Got tables, a bar, and TVs so you can watch whatever game you want  (+) Down to earth - a lot of the staff seemed to know their patrons and have a personal relationship with them. Also willing to chat with you. (we were playing a game on our ipad and occasionally asked the bartenders for help solving a problem, and they were totally down to play and help out) (+) Full bar, sufficient assortment of beers (+) The food looked pretty good, from what I witnessed around the restaurant. Saw someone eating what looked like spaghetti and meatballs which looked delicious  Cons:  (-) One bathroom, which kinda sucks in a bar  (-) A few of the bartenders I noticed did have somewhat of an attitude, but I think you just kinda have to have a backbone and not let it bother you.

We discreetly flagged the waiter, told him and asked to move. The waiter later brought over a couple drinks. After a few minutes we heard escalating voices about six feet from us and within two feet of people sitting at the bar and a nearby table. Instead of taking the waiter into privacy, the man who I assume is the owner with the heavy N.Y. accent was yelling for at least fifteen minutes at the waiter about being free with HIS alcohol. His language included a few choice words also. This was the most awkward dining experience ever. The five star reviews have to be employees, the owner or paid reviewers.",
