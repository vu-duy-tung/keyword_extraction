Unfortunately I was looking for a foodgasm. The food is good, but not amazing in any way to me. I really enjoyed trying the different bruschetta and the margherita pizza was decent but it wasn't a place that I would say amazes the taste buds.   I'll come back one night to try the sangria and maybe the med plate one day. But it's not on top of my list of places to visit.",

The pasta and pizza (especially the truffled pizza) keep me going back for dinner, though.  I like sitting on the patio on Friday night and watching all the people line up for cheap drinks at the club next door. Reverse happy hour provides a great opportunity to try some of the beers and wines offered by the glass too.  I usually skip dessert when I go out, but I love the gooey cookies made to order in a personal size skillet. Nothing beats a hot, half-baked chocolate chip cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top.  Thanks La Bocca for consistent good food, good values, and good service!",

I liked that they didn't try to cram too many tables onto the patio and it was comfortable to sit out there without feeling crowded. Their drink specials are good. I had their red and their white sangria (hey I wanted to try both) and I thought the white was better.   I enjoyed the beet salad which was excellent, very fresh and a good size. The flavors were really good. My friend and I split some bruschetta: the smoked prosciuto was good though I couldn't really taste the truffle oil; roasted artichoke, eh, it was just ok; roasted garlic with goat cheese and arugula was excellent. I loved the spicy bite of the arugula with the sweetness of the balsamic.   I would come back here for another glass of sangria and to try some more menu items. Onnly bad thing was the service was iffy; server was not very friendly and wasn't very attentive. But she did bring the check promptly when asked so not terrible.",

Their sangrias are great, I've had the white and the red and they both are very flavorful without being too much.  Most of all however, I have to talk about the bruschetta because that's what I get every time I go. I always get the same thing - one caprese, one pesto tomato, and two prosciutto goat cheese fig. They are all fab but really I could probably get four prosciutto goat cheese fig ones because those are the best!! Absolutely delicious. I've also had their limoncello which is pretty tasty. I go to La Bocca all of the time and it's definitely my favorite spot on Mill Ave.",

Bocca is just another Postino rip off, only with average pizza added to the menu.    The pizza is nothing special.  The sandwiches are okay, but you can find better at a deli.  Beer list is decent.  (Tripel Karmaliete, yes!)   Bruschetta Planks are just like the boards at Postino.  Literally, only one was different (pulled pork and pesto).  You get more at postino and they cut them into halves at Bocca while they are sliced into 4 pieced at postino so more people can try them.  Simply put... it's decent for a spot on Mill Ave, but there is absolutely nothing special about this place.  Blaaaaah.",

    "text": "It's always going to be a good night when I'm eating here. This is one of the few places I regularly go without a Groupon! They do have great happy hour specials and I almost always get a good buzz going because of it.   Pizza:  I love pizza. Don't matter if it's Little Caesars (yeah I said it) or Oregano's, or even frozen. BUT, I much rather have good pizza. 9 times out of 10 I'll crave La Bocca. They must have organic fresh indigents because you can really, really taste the difference between this and your run of the mill pizza joint. Plus, the prices are so reasonable, you have no reason not to go. The crust is perfectly crusty and crispy every time and compliments those fresh ingredients.   Happy Hour:  Like I said in my intro, always gives me a good buzz. They have great beers on tap, the servers always hook it up with my double fist request at 5 minutes till Happy Hour is over. Plus my date always enjoys their wine recommendations.   Ambiance:  The place is just so warm and inviting. This is a great place to take a date. Guys, if your reading this and trying to decide between here and Mellow Mushroom or some other spot on Mill, just call your date and tell them to decide.  You don't deserve to pick if you've read this far and still have not decided. By the way, La Bocca also has a spacious patio if you're with a large group (as I was last time) or want to enjoy the beautiful desert weather.",

La Bocca has been a go to spot on Mill every time I'm down there and is the obvious choice if you're going on a date in that area. Much more personal and less club-like than many of the places around there.",

    "text": "La Bocca was quite delicious when my man and I dined their a few weeks back. Located right off of Mill and University it is surrounded by lots of happening places which makes it nice and easy for you to find parking somewhere then walk to a yummy dinner at La Bocca followed by walking to any of your other nightly adventures you and your friends may have.  We arrived on a midweek evening around 5 or 530pm and it wasn't busy yet so we walked right in and sat at a comfortable lounge area with couches and a long table as opposed to a 'sit down' table. We ordered two beers (unfortunately its been too long for me to remember which ones but they were great!) and an order of their bruschetta. It was happy hour so the beers were cheaper. Their happy hour runs from open to 6:30pm!  With the Bruschetta plank you get to choose 4 different types and you get two pieces of each. We ordered: 1- two orders of housemade pesto with fresh roma tomato's, 2-Mozzarella basil, qc oil and balsamic and  3- goat cheese and beets. I can't write this review comparing it to another favorite restaurant of mine BUT I will say I was disappointed in the lack of vegetarian options and the portions we got with the bruschetta. We were still hungry after we left. Its ok though! We have never tried their pizza's and from what I hear they are amazing. Perhaps La Bocca will need to be where we go for our pizza fix.   Service was great and overall a good experience.",

They were all delicious and wished that I would've just ordered more. I also got their Sangria which was nice. It really wasn't as sweet or fruity as I thought it was going to be, but that is okay with me.   Tip: they have a free ice cream cookie deal going on right now. Get there now!",

The fig-prosciutto is my favorite, but the pesto here is also  incredible.  The roast beef sandwich is also wonderful.  How DOES the chef make that special sauce he puts on it?  The atmosphere is friendly and chic.  The service is always down to earth and attentive. Yesterday we had Laren Chamberlain as our server and she was great. Looking back, I have ALWAYS had great service.    The half priced wine at \"happy hour\" (from noon to six, I think) is like getting a present (when the bill comes). I'm betting that one of the biggest challenges for restaurants is to be consistently good, and La Bocca has done it.  The food is ALWAYS great.   The service is ALWAYS  attentive.

Good combo of breads/crackers, dried fruit, and 3 types of cheese (we chose a goat cheese, brie, and some hard cheese that had truffle oil in it.)  Next up, was a plank of bruschetta.  Our choices were the proscuitto & fig, pulled pork (wow!), roasted garlic (also wow) and fresh mozz/tomato/basil.  All were seriously great and would love to try some of the other options.  My friend & split the heirloom beet & tomato salad and it was as promised - full of flavor.  The shallot vinegrette complimented the salad perfectly.  Our other friend had a turkey, brie & fig sandwich and said it was also great.  Although we were quite full, we couldn't resist trying out the \"Crave\" Artisan ice cream. The dessert featured 3 flavors and they were outstanding - mint chocolate chip, banana toffee, and salted carmel almond.   The only disappointing aspect of our dinner was the red wine sangria - no one in our party of 3 really liked it. However, everything else was so good that I wouldn't hesitate to return....if only I lived nearby!!",

I love your classy, trendy decor - romantic lighting, dark colors, interesting art and wall treatments, and very comfy chairs and couches. I hate how crazy busy you can be, with so many others calling for your attention, slowing down my service and forcing me to yell during conversation. I love your wine list - lots of great choices (some good beers too), good happy hour and reverse happy hour specials, and 1/2-off bottles of wine on Sundays/Mondays. I hate how you treat me sometimes - you barely greet me when I sit down, you make me wait for my delicious drinks, and you forget what I ordered. I love your food - the olives are divine (and local), the goat cheese and pear salad is perfectly dressed with a perfect combination of sweet and salty, and the bruschetta boards have great variety and great ingredients (my favorites are the prosciutto & fig, and the salmon & capers). But I also hate your food - I'm sorry, but I do not like that your 'chewy' crust covers 2/3 of the pizza. It's just not right - I deserve more toppings than that. Last time you gave me a total of 4 truffled mushrooms, a smattering of spinach leaves, and WAY too much crust (and believe me, I love crust). My pizza was soggy in the middle, and it was even soggier last time when you brought me the sicily pizza. You leave me feeling disappointed; I thought you said you'd bring me the best.    Alas, La Bocca, I love you, and I hate you, but ultimately I always come back. Your charm is irresistible, even if you don't give me your best all of the time. I love your food enough and your wine more. Your specials keep me interested, and my hope for delicious pizza on Mill keeps me hooked.  You're great for a tasty meal and a fun night out - you're sassy and I like it.",

Yes we both have long hair, which hers was up the entire meal and mine was put back around when our second course came out. We merely found it a little too much of a coincidence that both of us found hairs in our meal. Instead of comping any of our meals they gave us a cookie, which was good but more of their food was the last thing we wanted! Every other time we had gone there though it was a really great experience, loved the food, fun environment. But we can't bring ourselves to go back ever again unless it's solely for drinks. They have the best sangria in town!",

They really know how to make great balanced flavors with minimal ingredients. I love the portions and was pleasantly surprised with the prices. They have an excellent pomegranate margarita and the serice has always been excellent. It's a nice change from the usual clubs and bars on Mill.",

Not so great. We tried three pizzas and although tasty, no sauce on them and nothing really special. On to the pasta dishes. Here's where it gets two stars. Gloppy and no taste. Had to cover it with crushed red chili peppers and parmesan cheese in a shaker just to get any real flavor. We tried more than one of these and they were all....uhhh...bad. Sorry, but they weren't even good enough to take home and eat the next day. Blah. Had the tiramisu for dessert, and it was really nice. The waiter said they didn't make it there, but that's fine. Who cares. It was nice. Somebody needs to go in the kitchen and show them how to make a nice flavorful pasta dish that doesn't look like a truck ran over it and it sat and dried out for a couple of days. No, really. It was bad. The interior of the place is very nice and no complaints with that, except the waiters kept bumping my chair every time they walked by in a hurry. You'd think they would have gone around or said something, but no. So weird. We won't be back.",

The first time I came was for my birthday last year and they handled our large group very well. The second time was just for dinner with a friend, and they allowed me to reserve a table for just 2 people, which is great because I know it can get crowded. I'm not a wine person but all the people I have brought with me here have assured me they have a great selection, so there you go! Mainly I come here for their Margherita Pizza. I ask for it well done and it's lovely, browned, & bubbly! They use lots of fresh basil like it's supposed to have! Great intimate and romantic atmosphere. Prices are reasonable for the high quality food.",

Just to lay it out there... there are a lot of douchebags.. and they are in every restaurant, bar, club... squeezed in to corners and crevices.. promise I'm making a point... So we meander in to La Bocca, because it's at the end of Mill and didn't look at all like the other testosterone filled buildings in the area. Boy am I glad we did!! It was so nice! We rarely get to go out.. maybe a couple times a year without the kiddos.. and I would have been super bummed if we wasted our night. We got a cozy corner, on a couch, facing away from the restaurant.. so intimate. And our server was so nice and on top of everything. I had 2 Prickly pear margaritas.. I crave them now! And hubby had 2 beers.. of some sort.. he really liked them. And we split a margarita pizza which the server suggested adding pesto.. great idea! mmm mm mm.. this will definitely be a regular spot for us when we're alone in Tempe. Loved it!",

The bartender, Dulia, only works Monday but try to go see her, she's very friendly and knowledgable. We started with the bruschetta plank (you pick 4 types and get 2 of each) and took Dulia's suggestions for dinner (I had a turkey,brie, and fig sandwich that I still dream about) and dessert. The dessert was amazing: a fresh baked, deep dish macadamia nut cookie with banana, caramel ice cream. It tastes like fresh baked banana nut bread. So delicious. Stop by id you're in the area. You wont be disappointed.",

    "text": "Our workplace had La Bocca pizza and an assortment of salads catered, as a work celebration. The pizzas, salads and dressings were all top notch.  With most gourmet cuisine, the quality and freshness of the ingredients is what makes or breaks the dish.  The ingredients and toppings used on the La Bocca pizzas and salads were of the very highest quality. High-End and extremely fresh and tasty pepperoni, olives, sausage, basil, assorted chesses, spinach, onion, mushrooms, etc., were used on many different tempting pizza selections.  The pizza crust was absolutely amazing, the kind of perfect crust only a wood-fired oven and a highly skilled pizzaiolo can produce.  The pizza crust has just the right amount of crispness to hold up to the ingredients and sauces, while not being a tough bite.  The crust was super tasty, and had just the right amount of caramelization to give that super-good toasted flavor that is so great on a pizza crust.  The salads were very fresh and used premium lettuces, not iceberg.  The parmesan cheese topping the salads was freshly sliced off a real parmesan cheese wheel, not the canned stuff.  I, really, cannot rate the pizza and salad at La Bocca any higher.  I can't wait to go to one of the Tempe or the Chandler locations, and try more items off their menu.",

Little did we know it was in the same neighborhood we hung out at the day before!   Asked for a seat outside and got seated on the side in the shade. Got to choose between a regular table or the lounge table and we opted for the regular table. I can't imagine it being that easy to eat at the other one.   We were going to go with two pizzas but went with one pizza and a bruschetta platter and I am so glad we did! We got the ricotta, pesto, pear, and mozzarella brsuchetta and the pear with gorgonzola was by far the best one. Soooo noms. I was saving my half for my last bite but my boyfriend freaking took it. Argh. Pretty sure it was $12 for four and you can pick from a rather large variety.   We got our go to mushroom truffle oil pizza. It is definitely on the smaller side of pizzas but we were both full by the end of the meal! The pizza was solid and the crust was perfect. The calzones looked amazing and seem to be super popular. Too bad we don't live in the area!   I got the blackberry mojito and it was whack. STAY AWAY. There was no mint in my mojito. I don't know if they strained it already or what but it was no good and at $9 I expect a half decent cocktail. Drank it all anyways because thats how I roll.",

    "text": "Stopped into this quaint eatery last night (which happened to be Valentine's Day) with a group of coworkers who had come to town for a work meeting. The atmosphere is dark and quaint and was filled with great live music. We arrived around 7:15 and were promptly seated (we had a reservation) We ordered a bruschetta plate as an appetizer and it was delicious. After the rest of our party arrived, we ordered our meals. Half the table ordered the Chicken Limone and the rest of us ordered a variety of pizzas. Let me address my food first...superb, excellent, wonderful. There was no salt and pepper on any tables, so I had to track down a waitress to request those. The Chicken Limone looked great, but they left off the chicken and lemon on all three orders. My table humorously refers to this as the chickastrophe of the evening. We were finally able to track down our waitress and the kitchen shortly brought three small plates with a grilled chicken breast and lemon. However, by this time, the pasta had already gotten cold. The last item to mention was the bathroom. I went to the bathroom three times. On all occasions, one of the two soap dispensers was out of soap and there were no paper towels in the paper towel dispenser. This was a bit concerning to me as I'm sure patrons weren't the only ones using the restroom. I tried tracking down yet another person to address that issue but gave up as it was getting pretty late in the evening. Overall, I would revisit this place on a day other than Valentine's Day as I believe in second chances (and the pizza was good).",

I posted a poor review on Yelp and was quickly contacted via email by Nick N. (a member of the executive team) who took great concern in the matter.  After a few emails were exchanged and the situation was explained in greater detail I was told their current reservation policies will be reviewed.  Although it was well after our reservation time we did end up getting seated and enjoyed an excellent meal along with great service.  We will be going back and hope that this experience can bring changes to their current policies that will benefit the restaurant and their guests.",

It took over 10 min to get a water and be greeted! 10min to get a actual drink and order an app (10 min to actually get our drink), and over 30min to order dinner. And over 15min just to close our tabs! Our server came over maybe 4 times in the hour and 15 min that we were there. We had empty plates sitting on the small table that we were sitting at, multiple people walked by, and no one even looked to pick up the plates. Also it was my friends 1st time there and they will not be returning due to such poor service. I'm sorry but it was that bad that I had to write a review",

    "text": "Since I landed in AZ this has been my favorite go to spot and has not budged from that #1 spot. I've now been there almost a dozen times and always experienced the same excellent quality of food and service. This is one of the few restaurants where I can not only say that I've tried almost everything on the menu but I've enjoyed every single thing. I'm a big advocate of promoting a good spot so I've recommend this place to a number of people and every single one of them has gotten back to me and thanked me for the suggestion because they enjoyed there meal so much.   Highlights: Location- Located on Mill St with an outdoor patio that lends to a lot of great people watching or just hanging out. The inside has a different environment and is more intimate, artsy feeling.   Service- One the best I've experience in a while, everyone is very attentive and friendly. All the servers are extremely knowledgeable about all their wines and how to properly pair them.    Food- I've gotta say they sure do love goat cheese here.  They have these scrumptious 'Brushetta Planks' that are simply beyond. You can mix and match to try different combinations but they are great to start with or if you're only there for drinks & apps.  As I have tried a lot my favorites are:    * Plank: Smoked prosciutto, fig, mascarpone, truffle oil    * Salad: Goat Cheese and Pear Salad, with dried cranberries and walnuts    * Pizza: Truffle Mushroom Pizza, with goat cheese and spinach (absolutely incredible)   * Pasta: Cavatappi poblano alfredo, with roasted chicken and  sauteed mushrooms  Drinks- I have found my perfect drink for this hot AZ weather POMAGRANITE MARGARITA it is so cool and refreshing. The perfect thing to cool you off on a hot summer day.   * Perk- I came here once on a Sunday night and all wine bottles were 50% off. If I remember correctly they do this every Sunday.",

We actually took my mom and her boyfriend here when they were in town visiting and they loved it! We ordered a bottle of chardonay (and a beer for Eric) and had a great time out on the patio.

We watched two other tables get seated and their drink orders taken by their waiters until the hostess finally came with water and apologized for the wait.   15 minutes later and still, no one came to our table. We watched 3 waiters, the hostess and the manager go up to the other 4 tables in the patio except for ours. At this point we asked the hostess where our waiter was. She was surprised nobody came by our table but said she would get them. Another 5 minutes goes by and still more waiters attend the other tables but nobody approaches us. At this point we got up, found the manager, and told him we were leaving. He said there was a miscommunication with the waiters. I still don't understand how NONE of the waiters/manager/hostess managed to walk past us multiple times without asking us if we had been helped.   The food probably would have been good but with this kind of service, not worth it. Never been this disappointed with a restaurant's service before. Get it together guys!",

There was a little bit of a party vibe happening on the patio in a fun but not obnoxious way - we were still able to enjoy a low key and intimate dinner. Service was attentive and top notch even on a busy night.   I loved the bruschetta plank - how cool is it that you get to pick 4 different options off the menu? Each comes with 2 slices, perfect for sharing. The one with beets really stood out, the chicken one not so much.   We also split a salad and a pizza - perfect portion for 2 and great variety of options for both! Something about the bread here (in the bruschetta and pizza crust) is just perfect in the taste and softness.   We opted to walk off dinner a bit and then have dessert at Slickables next door, but would love to come back and give that a try here. I was intrigued by the cookies, described in the menu as \"made to order, and worth the wait\"  Highly recommend!",

So unique you couldn't find it anywhere else other than la bocca, and to be honest it was so delicious it used to be one of the reasons I would come here......I would look forward to dessert! The last time I went there you guys took it off your menu, HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT i was devostated! I ended up getting the oven baked cookie with vanilla ice cream on top, that almost EVERY restaurant serves. PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!

When you're a table of two, and you see 4 other tables (one being 6+) get their food before you receive yours.. You begin to wonder if perhaps there may be some preferential treatment here. My wife and I are from California Bay Area, and we've eaten at way better, higher-end places, and NEVER have I seen four other tables (whom arrived after we did) get their food first.  In addition, the gentlemen running the show, came to a table next to ours to fill up water, while my wife's cup was left unattended for a while, before I had to ask him to please fill up our water. When our food comes out (late), I make a point to ask for my check and boxes, a typical indicator that the food took entirely way too long and we are now running late to our concert. My plate was missing the sauce that accompanies the dish,  and the waitress was kind enough to apologize because she as well was surprised by the wait. My wife and I made sure to leave a $20 tip on $90 tab worth of food and drinks (5 total at $10+) so that the waitress knew it was not her fault, but rather the way the tables and food were being managed. I'm convinced our order was not put in until she finally double checked. Thanks to our awesome waitress, however, we would not ever return due to the preferential treatment we observed. Thanks for reminding us we are NOT in an eclectic area of Phoenix, High Street as they proclaim.",

It was 50% crust and the tomatoes were not even ripe. Service was sub-par (took a while for drinks, dirty martini served without olives, asked for salt which never came, etc). I don't blame the server as she seemed very busy; perhaps they need to hire additional help. Save your money and grab pizza at Slices down the street for a tenth of the price.",

We ordered the garlic pizza and also the caesar salad. The pizza was okay, it wasn't anything special but i absolutely loved the caesar salad. I also ordered the sangria which i was not happy with at all and i usually love sangria.",

The first time I went to La bocca I have to say I was not impressed, I got the mushroom pizza, which had probably 2 mushrooms on the whole thing and a salad on top-, not what I expected. But after going back about a month later (and never ordering that pizza again) I realized that the brushettas are the thing to get here. My favorite is the sun dried tomato/goat cheese one and my roommate likes the caprese. The hummus is also a really good appetizer to get there. I've tried other pizzas and have enjoyed them much more than I did my fist time here, also the italiano sandwich is so clutch if you're craving meat. This is another place my roommate and I love to go to when were hung over. They have huge couches that you can relax on and the best bloody marys ever. Carbs+ bloody marys= amazing hangover remedy. This place is like humble pie with the gourmet personal pizzas but half the price and a lot better atmosphere. The servers are all friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the menu and all very attractive (HUGE plus). Hands down- La bocca is one of the best places to go to on mill ave. If you haven't tried it yet, you're missing out.",

We went for happy hour and I got the red sangria. We split a salad with goat cheese that was easily spilt by two people and we finished the whole thing. We also shared a margarita pizza and it was sooo good! I love traditional pizzas and this one hit the spot.   We sat there for awhile, over 2 hours and then as we were getting up this place was getting really busy. There was a line out the door and people we waiting for tables. I'm not sure if it was a certain event and that's why they were so busy, but I would call and ask if you need to make a reservation if you're coming in after 5 pm just in case.   Overall great happy hour! I will be back when I'm in town!",

    "text": "Husband and I dined at La Bocca tonight for our first date night in weeks; we're both servers and we work nights so finding time to have a date night is near impossible. Because we are servers, our standards are high; but so is our level of grace. We understand sometimes you just have a bad day or a bad shift, sometimes you misgreet or forget to ring something in- we're human; it happens. Unfortunately it seemed like this wasn't an exception but rather a regular evening. The hostess sat us at a dirty table, a server came to wipe it down and apologized; but not before putting the dirty rag on the table. We then moved cause I was cold and it then took another 10 minutes for our server to come up and greet us (5 minutes before that, I watched the two servers discuss their rotation and discuss who was going to take us). While the food was really good, I couldn't help but notice it took an unprecedented time for food to come out with only 10ish or less tables in the building; most of which were already eating. Even our waters and wine took a decent amount of time. I looked around and noticed the same behavior with other tables; one guest had to get up and ask a server to come over and order, another table wasn't greeted for 15 minutes. One table was told \"oh I threw out the lemons because we're closing.\" We were never checked on once our food dropped, and we patiently waited for a pasta that was forgotten to be rung in (ok- it happens, no problem). Never got checked in again after that so we had to ask for our check. 15 minutes later our server said \"oh man I can't believe I forgot your check,\" then grabs my husbands card and then leaves his card in a check presenter on the pos terminal for another 10-15 minutes. During this time, the server with the dirty rag reeked of weed after he came back in from closing down the patio. Oh- let's not forget the table who was misgreeted for 15 minutes and then when they ordered an appetizer were promptly told that the kitchen was closing in 15 minutes and they wouldn't have time to order an app and entree.   All in all- food and 1/2 priced bottles of wine honestly aren't enough for us to have another go around at La Bocca. Too many pizza places in Phoenix to waste a night being ignored for a $15 8inch pizza.",

Phoenix is awash in amazing Pizza restaurants and that trend weirdly ends at the Tempe border. It's like a glitch in Capitalism. Anyway La Boca is at least half way there. The pizza is good if not great. The salads are tasty combinations but with ample lettuce and skimpy toppings. If you are accustomed to the bruschetta at Postino, the bruschetta is a disappointment- again very skimpy toppings. It wasn't bad. I'll be back because I live in Tempe now and it's convenient but if this restaurant could take a page from Cibo, Bianco, Pomo, Federal Pizza, etc. and improve the taste and quality a little bit, they would be packed all the time.",

    "text": "One of my friends recommended La Bocca to me. The walls of the restaurant were maroon red. They were decorated with large greyscale abstract paintings and a mosaic of black thick framed photographs from various cultures. Next to the wine bar, there was a screen with the movie Paris, Je T'AiMe playing. There was also Spanish music playing in the background.   Shortly after we were seated, our server brought us water garnished with a cucumber slice. We couldn't resist from ordering the award winning sangria (the \"blanc\"). It's interesting that you have a choice of ordering blanc, rojo, or mixed sangria. The Sangria was made from wine, spirits, spices, and fresh fruit. The Blanc sangria was  quite refreshing. It was garnished with pineapple chunks and chopped orange slices. The Rojo sangria tasted like sour cherry. It was garnished with chipped orange slices. For non-alcoholic beverages, I'd recommend the Desert Bloom Iced Tea. It's a local tea that the restaurant brews daily. It's naturally sweet green rooibos tea with floral-earthy tones from notes of cactus essence, cactus petals, and cornflower petals. The tea has a peach and mango flavor.  We were happy with everything we ordered tonight. Every dish was the perfect portion and quite flavorful. Everyone in our party was able get a taste of everything ordered without getting too full.  For appetizers, I'd recommend the Heirloom Beets salad which consisted of diced golden and red beets, served over a slice of green, yellow, and red heirloom tomatoes. It was topped with a bed of arugula and candied walnuts and drizzled with balsamic shallot vinaigrette. Since some of our guests weren't fans of goat cheese, we requested for it to be served on the side.  For pastas, I'd recommend Chicken Limone which consisted of freshly kneed taglietti pasta in a lemon garlic caper sauce. It was topped with roasted chicken, lemon zest, and freshly grated parsley (and possibly other fresh herbs). It was with two slices of tomato based garlic bread and a side salad of your choice. I chose a side Caesar salad which was tossed in a tart Caesar dressing and garnished with sliced grape tomatoes.  For pizzas, I'd recommend adding diced roasted chicken to the Margarita pizza which consisted of crushed San Marzano tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, olive oil, and basil.",

How are you supposed to reheat a pizza that has a fresh spinach salad on top? You're not. Get your life together and eat this whole pizza in one sitting already.  The truffled mushroom pizza tasted much better when I scrapped off the spinach. The spinach was overpowering, visually and inside my mouth. The picture of the pizza is still making me laugh. The people want spinach? Give the people what they want! The crust was decent, and I tend to shy away from crust.  The goat cheese & pear salad was fun: who knew that purple-colored pears and candied walnuts could take spring mix to that next level? Sugar is a fantastic thing.   My most favorite memory from this meal was how my Mormon colleague discovered virgin mojitos here. Drink on, friend, drink on. Our server was quite funny and very prompt - she was loving the virgin mojitos.",

All in all, great atmosphere and food, they know their way around a pizza oven and how to serve up prosciutto.    I suppose I could compare La Bocca favorably with Postino's, I will definitely be back for a date night.  Next time, with a better date!",

The pasta was perfect, they had my favorite wine and the service was amazing. The restaurant was very busy yet we still received superb service. I will go again and recommend it to friends. Great job!",

Our waiter, Chris, provided great recommendations and we pretty much followed his advice: Truffle mushroom pizza, chicken pesto pizza, Roast beef sandwich au jus and pesto caprese sandwich.  The pizzas were awesome, the Sammy's were served on seasoned pizza dough bread.  Generous sides of miso cole slaw.  All of it delicious.  Very reasonably priced.  Loved it!",

    "text": "La Bocca has great food and wine, no doubt! The Bocca Trio pizza is delish and the red sangria is a must order. I've been happy with all the pizzas I've ordered. The Garlic and Margarita are good, and if you like mushrooms you have to get the mushroom pizza. There are some misses though... the bruschetta boards can be hit or miss and the pasta dishes lack seasoning. Also, really wish the restaurant had ranch for all those crusts on the pizza... would be amazing!  Be warned: you need to call ahead if there will be a wait. I was told last night by the hostesses that the reason I was watching parties be sat in front of my party was because they are required to seat parties who call ahead in front of the people on the waiting list! A pretty wacky rule for a restaurant that won't take reservations, and pretty frustrating for a hungry group of out of towners I was hosting who had to wait an hour to be sat when we were told 30 min! I would suggest a re-thought around that lame policy and maybe suggest management be a little more liberal with the air conditioning in the middle of the summer... it's hot in that place when it's full!  All in all, it is a good restaurant though, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good meal on Mill.",

The employees were not that friendly and just didn't look like they wanted to be working but I didn't let that ruin my experience here. My friend and I shared the Bruschetta Planks and got, housemade pesto with fresh roma tomato, housemade pesto with fresh roma tomato, roasted garlic, goat cheese, arugula w/ balsamic, and smoked prosciutto, fig, mascarpone, truffle oil. I had high expectations since the place looked good and the reviews were good but only two out of the four things we picked were good which was disappointing.

    "text": "Looking for a new place to celebrate my 64th birthday. Live in Tempe, and like to support local businesses. As I love pizza, decided my husband and I would ride Orbit downtown for an early dinner at La Bocca Urban Pizzeria + Wine Bar. So glad we did! We chose to sit inside although the temperatures this evening would have allowed for easy outside sitting. La Bocca has an outside dining area that faces Mill but also wraps around the north side of the restaurant. Inside the ambiance was soothing. Dark wood tables with a hint of red, a central area for napkins/utensils, plates, etc. Good size bar. Music played, and seem to become louder as the evening progressed.   We were a bit confused on how to order the planks, but had an excellent server throughout the evening who explained how to order (for $12 we could order 4 different bruschettas). The four bruschettas came sliced (a generous portion to be shared with one another), so for a total of 8 slices in all. My favorite was the smoked prosciutto, fig, mascarpone and truffle oil- mainly due to the meat and fig-really did not even taste the truffle oil. My husband's favorite and my second favorite was the Gorgonzola, pear, basil w/balsamic reduction. Would have liked the balsamic reduction to have been a bit more prominent in the serving. We enjoyed the roasted baby beets, goat cheese and honey drizzle (again, a bit more honey would be nice!). The roasted garlic could have displayed the garlic more, but did enjoy it with the arugula with balsamic and goat cheese.   We chose the margarita pizza. Full-bodied tomato sauce and rich melted mozzarella with basil leaves. Crust was excellent... more on the thin side and not overly heavy. We brought 2 slices home with us!!!  We arrived during happy hour which helped hold our tab down... 2 glasses of an excellent Mirth chardonnay (unoaked) and my husband enjoyed 2 Perroni beers. As it was my birthday, received a free desert. So, for under $40 we had an exceptional dinner at a great place that we look forward to coming back to try other pizzas and their plates and salads.   Great relaxed atmosphere during the 4:30pm to 6:00pm time we were there.",

I did not care for the wine and chose another. Only got charged for the one glass. We each enjoyed our enters (papadelle limon and smoked prosciutto respectively).

    "text": "La Bocca was on my radar since it opened earlier this year... I cannot believe how long it took me to finally get there, but it was worth the wait.  I went with a group of four on a Monday night.  (1/2 Price Bottles of Wine from 5pm - close on Mondays; needless to say, we took advantage of that special!)  We let my friend Anthony do the ordering since he'd been many times before and he also has a vested interest of sorts... We started with two salads: the prosciutto, zucchini, and artichoke (my favorite) and the goat cheese and pear... also quite tasty.  You can't go wrong with either one.  We then had the truffled harvest mushroom and the spiced pepperoni pizzas.  Yum!  The thin crust and the combination of fresh ingredients on both of them were perfect!    Along the way, owner Julian Wright sat down with us to share some wine and conversation - he's fantastic!  While he was completely engaged in talking to our group, I could tell he was also constantly surveying the restaurant to make sure all was running smoothly.  Every patron that walked in the door received immediate attention including our group.  Our waitress was sweet and I liked that she gave some attitude back to Jared when he was joking around with her.  We had a blast on top of a great meal and ended up staying for hours enjoying  two bottles of wine (maybe more than that as I lost track) during that time.  One of them was a La Crema Pinot Noir, but I think we had a merlot as well and maybe another Italian Red.  I guess I'll have to go back and take notes next time.  Another reason to return will be to try the brusschetta - it sounds amazing.    I have a feeling it won't take me as long to return to La Bocca as it took for me to get there in the first place.  You can't go wrong at La Bocca if you're looking for pizza, salad, wine, and all in a warm, welcoming atmosphere.  Check out their other daily pecials too - I know I will!",

Unique and delicious pizzas (and like Jennifer mentioned, huge air bubbles around the crust. *whispers* Thats my favorite part.). Their bruschettas are ALL amazing. And, IMO, the best dessert is the trio of salty caramel, banana toffee, and actual mint mint chocolate chip ice creams. I would honestly go back just for that.  The first time we sat at the bar, and felt like we were hanging out w/ one of our friends the bartender was so nice (and she poured a great martini).  The second time we sat in one of the comfy couch corners for happy hour (drinks only) and our waitress was equally as inviting.",

    "text": "Made reservations ahead of time to have dinner with a few friends from out of town, the food was satisfactory but the service wasn't great. First off, I thought we would be able to be seated in a nicer area since I reserved ahead of time, but instead the six of us were seated in an area that was just WAY too dark. Like, couldn't see my food. Could barely see my friend in front of me.   Second, the waiters, as kind as they tried to be, seemed super stressed out and exasperated throughout the night. I felt pressured during my order to hurry up, and when the food came out, a snobby brunette literally dropped off our food without saying a single word, and when I asked for more water (since it hadn't been filled the entire night) she just gave me a face and never came back to our table again.   Here are some of the things were ordered:   Red wine sangria -- 2 carafes for 6 people made it to about 1.5 glasses per person. Taste was more tart than sweet, but the only fruit in it was orange peels. Peels.   Bruschetta planks -- nice attempt, but I prefer Postino's Central. I enjoyed the proscuitto fig, but the other ones were not so good. Chicken/Tomato bruschetta tasted weird, and the pear/balsamic just didn't work.  Porco pizza -- the meat was good, cheese was good, but together it needed a little bit more spice, as it was a bit bland. Our waiter was nice enough to give us some tabasco but I never thought pizza at a place like this would actually need it.   In summary, I don't think I would return to this restaurant. I thought the vibe would be smooth, relaxed, and ambient, but it was quite the opposite. I'll be looking for other pizza places from here on out.",

It's comfortable with heaters in our wintertime but a bit toasty in the summer. The staff is friendly and efficient and the food is good. Our party of 7 met for dinner before a play at Gammage on a Saturday evening. It was a bit crowded as the evening wore on and we were glad we had come early. The bruschetta is quite good and the Med plate was dynamite. We tried all eight of their bruschetta, and I love that fig!! Their salads are good and so are their pizzas. White wine sangria is also a great choice. Stop in and enjoy an afternoon or evening.",

Well, for one of these places, La Bocca most definitely delivered: * sangria, check. * loads of bruschetta, check. * cheese plates, check. * make your own \"urban\" pizza, check.  Sarcasm aside, I really did like La Bocca. The wait staff was lovely and helpful, and we liked *most* of our food. The sangria and the bruschetta were delicious - five stars! But then things started going downhill.   The cheese plate just didn't deliver for me - I actually couldn't eat some of them. Then my Brussels sprouts and proscuitto stromboli came out - and it flooded my plate with some type of watery liquid as soon as I cut into it. It was just plain gross. The server let me send the stromboli back, and I ordered a meatball pizza instead. The pizza was definitely a notch up, but I wasn't blown away.  We did end the night on a high note with creme brulee that was perfectly crunchy on top and cold in the middle.   Although I'm not in love with places like La Bocca, this is a totally good option if you're on Mill Ave in Tempe and wanting some delicious sangria and bruschetta.",

    "text": "My husband and I were at the Tempe Arts Festival around lunch time, and I spotted La Bocca.  I had it mentally bookmarked for quite a long time, so I was excited to finally try it.  I was somewhat disappointed.  While I appreciate the pretty people that work there, those pretty people might want to carry a pretty pen and write down an order.  We had the bruschetta, which comes with 4 selections, a pizza, and two drinks.  So that's kind of a lot to remember.  When I asked our server if he was going to remember all that, he smirked as if to say \"I am a professional lady.\"    Our bruschetta came and was average overall.  The roasted garlic was anything but roasted.  It was sliced and did not even remotely have the sweet, caramelized flavor you expect.  It was cooked enough to not knock you over, but still retained the firmness of raw garlic.  Since the bruschetta took quite awhile, I was not concerned that our pizza order was taking even longer.  However, our server came by and asked if we needed anything else and I asked about the pizza.  Deer in the headlights stare.  No real apology, just a head shake that told the whole story.  His aversion to ink now resulted in another 20 minutes or so to get the pizza.  I will say the \"sicily\" pizza was really good with schreiner's sausage, parmesan and goat cheese, and sundried tomatoes.  Nice bit of char on the crust.  If in the area, I would come back for that.  Only I will write down the order myself.",

We also had the antipasti plate, which was a really great blend of savory treats.  THEN. On to the main event: PIZZA.   We had the Brussel Sprout pizza, which everyone loved, but I think I loved it a little more. We also had the truffled mushroom (seeing a trend), which I loved even MORE than the brussel sprout and we had the Porco, which I loved (but still loved) least. The Porco has an unexpected amount of kick, which I appreciated.   After 4...or was it 5 (?) bottles of wine, a relaxing and enjoyable evening we were on our way.   It was a fun dinner, for a reasonable price. I'd totally go back again.   So if you go: Get something with truffles. That is all.",

The first is that when we were initially given the wait time, they were not completely honest with us.  They told us it would be about 10 minutes and as we sat down on the waiting couch, one of the members of my group overheard them saying it would probably be longer.  We ended up only waiting about 15 minutes, but clarity is important.  Once we sat down, our service was great.  Our server was externally personable and let us know when the giant group was about to order so that we could get our food in before them.  The food itself was decent.  I was not amazed by anything, but it was still good.  The cost is a little on the expensive side for the amount of food you get.  The thing I was most disappointed in was the lack of bread.  This is partially on me for not researching well enough, but I'm used to Italian restaurants giving bread at the start of the meal, and to not have bread was saddening.",

We came mainly for drinks, but I had to try their bruschetta board. It was ok - definitely not as good as Postino. My friends and I got one carafe of each the red and white sangria. The white was more popular at our table. The waitress suggested (and it's offered by the glass) mixing the two. Mixing it wasn't bad...more parts white than red though. Haha. What was nice was that the carafes is nothing but sangria. They provide cups with ice in them. Thus no need to worry about dilution!   While it's unfair to compare this wine bar to Postino because they do have more menu items (ie pizza), it's hard not to! And unfortunately, Postino is going to come out on top in terms of wine and board (again, that's all we came here for!),",

Long version: stopped in and was told to seat ourselves. Hostess brought out our menus then a while later a waiter came out to take our order. He was extremely aloof, and not at all interested in helping us. He took our orders while leaning casually up against the wall then just left, no interaction at all. He dropped our wine off, again with nothing said. Our pizza arrived burned, dry and pretty flavorless. No one came out to ask how our food was and we had to go searching for some chili flakes and parmesan at the bar.  Then our waiter came out to advise of last call..... We asked for our bill and all of the sudden he was helpful and told us if we needed anything to just \"holler\". Pretty sure that is how the BEGINNING of waiting a table is supposed to go,not before the table pays and leaves.  Anyways. If I was ever in town again, I would never return here. Easily the most disappointing $50 dinner ever.",

We started with a single bruschetta and a house Caesar.  Warning.  The bruschetta a really big and bready.  Nice choice of toppings though.  House Caesar was fine although the croutons, obviously made from bruschetta bread, were tough/chewy vs crisp.  The half portion of chicken Alfredo was good.  Nice size if having an appetizer.  The pizzas were fine.  The truffle mushroom had so much vinegary baby spinach on top that the mushrooms were lost.  The Regina was better.   The couple next to us obviously were disappointed in their pasta dishes but received literally no attention from wait staff until it was too late.  Anyway, it was a little weird.  We don't live here so won't return.",

Had never been here before and it really didn't live up to expectations set by other reviewers.  Food - bruschetta was serviceable but a bit pricey at $13.50. My gal ordered a salad that got sent back because it didn't taste right at all. I ordered the bolognese and I expected a savory meat sauce but it ended up sweet with a thicker noodle that had quite a bite to it...  Service - sub par... by far... extended waits... had to ask 4 times for a child's/togo cup for our 3 year old... had to ask three different servers to order a drink and when I told our server that we were ready to order he walked away.  Not sure if we'll be back... 20 minutes drive, better Italian food closer to is in the Gilbert Heritage District, and the value wasn't there...",

It was like a few flakes of cheese. And a dab of ricotta which was an up charge. Second time I have had a terrible calzone there. Last time I brought my dad because he was visiting and wanted a calzone. Well lesson learned this is not the place to go for calzones.",

    "text": "Bottom Line: I'll go back, depending on who I'm with and my mood.  I was in PHX with some friends. We headed over to Mills and of course we were overwhelmed with eating options ......well, they were overwhelmed, I pulled up Yelp ;-) We narrowed it down to Pizza. There were 2 options - right across the street was a Mellow Mushroom. We stood outside looking at the menu at La Bocca and a nice guy, named John, stopped to tell us that the place was awesome. So we went in.  It was empty. We grabbed a table near a window and ordered.  It was Happy Hour so it was $5 off glasses of wine. So I had a very nice Chardonnay for $5.  I ordered one of the Bruschetta selections and so did one of my friends. He had Brie with seasonal fruit. The fruit was candied oranges with the rinds on. It was bitter and sweet at the same time. I enjoyed it. Mine was Roquefort with pears and balsamic vinegar. They were $3.50 each or 4 for $12. They were delicious and filling. Thick slices of bread loaded with the toppings and cut in half so you could easily order a few, mix and match, and share.  Three of us had pizza and one had a pasta dish. The pizzas were very good. Not the best I have ever had - and to be honest I probably like Mellow Mushroom's pizza better. But that being said, this place was a much better all around experience.  Beautiful interior design. Beautiful place settings, giant elegant, Olivia Pope'esque, wine glasses. Intimate yet spacious. The place filled up by the time we left. Also, right before we left live music started.  So, as I said, if I'm with a group who just wants to go get a filling pizza and get in and out quick - I'd go to MM. But if you want to have a nice evening, sitting and chatting with friends and have a well paced meal - I'd go here.  Especially on Mon or Tues when they do the pizza and bottle of wine for $20 - go with a friend and add 4 specialty bruschettas for $12 and you are at $20 per person (tip included) for a great night! Bottom Line: Bookmarked for \"those\" nights ;-)",

I will not go without getting the med plate appetizer, it is DELISH!

The fresh ricotta with rosemary and honey is a must.  And when it's happy hour pricing, it's even better. Look no further, I have done all of the searching for you. Go here.",

The first night our party of six were enjoying our pizzas when I casually mentioned that we'd ordered one pizza without mushrooms and some had found their way unto it.  Within a a couple of minutes the manager was at our table with an apology and an offer to comp a couple of deserts.  Geez, it was just an errant mushroom!  In fact, the pizza here is very good and they clearly go the extra mile in trying to accommodate their customers. I was please enough to return the next night with my wife and share a Margarita pizza (which is very good).  Wanting something sweet to finish off our meal, we opted for the chocolate mousse.  While it may not have been the ultimate dessert it was quite good and we enjoyed several bites before deciding we'd had enough to satisfy without adding unnecessarily to our growing waistlines.  Seeing we'd only eaten a bit, the waitress comped the dessert.  We explained we'd been happy with the mousse and were just full but she took it off the bill just the same.   Now, there are a lot of choices where to eat and a whole lot of pizza joints, but for my money a little extra courtesy goes a long way.  Couple that with good food and reasonable prices and La Bocca is sure to see more of me.",

We also went here for New Years Eve and that was a great deal - we sat on the couch and watched all the Mill Ave madness from a safe distance.

It was very good, and lived up to the reviews, I liked the pesto one far better than any of the three others that I tried, although they were all very good.  The pesto one was just fantastic.  I ordered the garlic pizza for my meal, and it was good but not as good as I was hoping for.  Overall I'd love to go back again and try a few different pizzas as it was hard to decide on just one.  My wife said that the baked cookie dessert was awesome, but order it ahead as they bake it when you order it and it takes a good 15 minutes.",

Possibly the best part about our dinner was our waiter Chris. He was very polite, extremely accommodating to my vegan diet and just an all around good server. I would come back to La Bocca again and again.",

Half off all Wine by the Glass Draft Beer, and Mixed Drinks (except Housemade Cocktails & Martinis).  Even primo liquors like Grey Goose, etc are half off!  Ambiance - Modern and stylish.  Fun to sit in the outside patio and people watch. Clientele - All ages Parking - Structure off Seventh. Service- Excellent and attentive. Food/Drinks 1. Bruschetta Plank - Choose four toppings.  Bread was sliced thin and crispy.  Good texture.  Came with four bread slices, each with a selected topping and sliced in half. Good for 1-2 people. a) Sun Dried Tomato & Goat Cheese - Very good.  Tart from the sun dried tomato, combined with a bit of fresh basil and goat cheese to provide creaminess and reduced balsamic vinegar for sweetness. b) Prosciutto, Fig & Truffled Marscapone - Creamy marscapone mixed with the saltiness of the prosciutto and sweetness of the fig.  Great topping, but my favorite was still a or c.  c) Roasted Artichoke - Canned artichokes and red bell peppers which was very refreshing. d) Sausage & Babaganoush - Recommended by our server but was the worst topping.  Tons of sausage, carmelized onions and a layer of babaganoush.  Just was blah and dry. The flavors didn't jump out at you. 2) Peach/Pear Bellini- Refreshing but bland.  It was a slushy drink which was nice in the hot sun.  However, I couldnt' really taste the ingredients besides the bits of pear skin zest.  The pear zest was a bit overpowering at the bottom and made my throat itch.  The interesting part was that the bellini was topped with a pour of merlot which was good.",

Tonight was my third time and I enjoyed a margarita pizza with a glass of Russian Jack Pinot for half price before 630pm.

The pizza could have used a little more cheese in my opinion tonight, but all in all it suited what I was looking for in a great quick and light dinner.",

They are very generous with their herbs and spices. The pesto and tomato bruschetta is very refreshing and tasty.   If you are not stuffed after their delicious pizza, I highly recommend trying their cookie and ice-cream dessert. The cookie is served soft and warm right out of the oven, exactly the way you want to eat a cookie! The mint ice-cream goes really well with the chocolate chip cookie, especially with the fresh mint they add to the ice-cream.   A great place for a casual get-together.",

The white sangria, however, is highly recommended - one of my fave beverages, and done so well here for $6.

This is a cool little restaurant/wine bar and I was pleasantly surprised by the service even though it was a Sunday night and somewhat slow. We ordered two pizzas to try since it was our first time there.  I thought the flavored were good and the crust was favorable on one. The second pizza did have some soggy crust from the toppings which I can't stand so hopefully next time the execution will be a bit better.  I could overlook it somewhat because of the flavor combinations which I liked.  This is a great place for happy hour or a nice date. The menu options looked diverse enough to want to try different things next time. Will definitely be back.",

Every part of it was delicious, including the sauteed mushrooms I asked for as a replacement for feta (no cheese for me).

    "text": "La Bocca is one of those places I wish I went to more than I actually do.  It is just a little outside my regular travel radius and going anywhere on Mill always seems like a bit of a chore (unless you are already going to be there for something else).  Yes, I know, that sounds really lazy.  For the lazy readers out there, let me give you the facts.  Happy hour goes until 6:30 and the wines by the glass are half price.  The food is delicious, the atmosphere is cool and a small step up from casual.  They also have daily specials (ex: 1/2 bottle days, 2-for-1 pizza, or reverse happy hour), so I would check their website.  Regardless of the internal challenges I have getting to La Bocca, once I am there, I am very, very happy!  I have been a few times now and I have had delicious meals each time.  Each time I go to order food, I can't get past the top of the menu.  The bruschetta planks are fabulous!  Choosing only four is hard as they all sound so fantastic.  And $12 might seem a little expensive, however, they are so big that one bruschetta is actually two because they cut them in half to make it easier to eat and easier to share.  Prosciutto and fig is always one of my favorite combinations, along with the salmon and capers, then there are the traditional tomato bruschettas, and few others thrown in for fun.  The Mediterranean Plate is another great one too.  The babaganoush, the hummus, the house made flat bread, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  And who knew olives could be so extra delicious when served warm.  While I fill up on the top of the menu, I have seen others at my table order pizza, and that is just as fabulous.  Yes, I admit, I stole a piece of their pie, but it was too tempting not too.  Last time I went, the service was a little slow, but we were there to bask in La Bocca's calming, classy atmosphere, enjoy each others company, drink wine and relax; so we didn't mind.  When they did come around, the servers were very pleasant.  If La Bocca were a little closer, it would probably be one of my go-to places.  Then again, I really like that there is a place like this among all the other bars up and down Mill Avenue.    My advice, go here when you want good food, good wine, and an escape from the craziness going on in the rest of Tempe . . . or the world.",

Earlier in the day we hiked South Mountain and we walked around the Dessert Botanical Gardens.  I don't think she had enough food throughout the day, so she was famished when we got there.  I thought she was ready to pass out.  We skipped eating at a table and went straight to the bar.  I notified the bartender that my friend needed some bread right away.  She was very concerned and got us fresh bread with olive oil and basil.  I think this item actually cost money, but I did not see it on the bill.  Throughout the night, she frequently checked up on us to see how we were doing.  My friend got the mushroom truffle pizza with goat cheese and spinach, and I got the garlic pizza.  We got the bottle of Riesling, and it is half off bottles on Sunday and Monday.  In addition, you are not forced to finish it all as they recork it and pack it to go.  The decor had a very dark and intimate setting.  This would be a great place to take a girl on a date.  Near the bar, they have black and white movies playing all night.  The bartender even told us that if we had a certain request, they would go out and find it and play it for the future.  This was a very pleasant and welcoming experience, and I will definitely visit again!",

Although I admit I'll sometimes just order the appetizer sampler and goat cheese salad, (and a pitcher of sangria,) and I'll be set for the evening.    The food is the main draw, but I have to say that the atmosphere is nice as well.  It's fairly trendy and the tables are candlelit--good for a date night or a classier alternative to a normal evening on Mill.   I would definitely recommend La Bocca!

The fact that the server never asked if I was done makes this fact even worse.   I loved the artwork hanging on the walls of this place. The walls were cleverly colored red (FYI Red enhances your appetite and makes you think you could eat more than you should), bartop was long and inviting, tables indoor or outdoor were very modern and very well suited for the ASU district.   Only tried bruschetta here because I mainly went for the happy hour drinks, but I will come back for their pizza's which I assume is out of this world (two girls next to us finished their individual pizzas each and left without a crumb left on their plates).",

The wait times have never been lengthy for me, granted I usually try to avoid dinner rushes unless I'm equipped with a reservation. Service tends to be on the quick side. Well organized and knowledgable, the staff here will guide you well into your first meal experience with ease. Extensive wine lists covering various regions and styles will entice you to indulge a bit into a drink or two. Be careful though as the wine can quickly rack up your bill!   The decor is incredibly well done. Beautiful paintings and alluring photographs have been meticulously placed with astoundingly careful consideration. The furniture gives an oddly successful blend of casual elegance which translates itself into a nearly unmatched ambiance. Old classic movies are often projected onto a wall near the bar, something intriguing to me as I have never seen such a thing in a restaurant before. Thankfully the sound is muted on the movie and purposes itself only as an intelligent use of visual oddity. Great touch. For looks alone you cannot find much better in the Tempe area.   Appetizers here are very well done. The Bruschetta is an absolute MUST! Do not leave here without getting your table at least one platter of the delicacies. Oh my are they good...   Pizzas here are made in your standard artisan style. The Sicilian is the best, but maybe I only think so because of my natural gravitation to anything goat cheese. You can't really go wrong with the pizza, it's a solid artisan pie with typically great flavors and cooked to perfection. Only one time has La Bocca let me down, and the manager was quick to fix the issues with the food. Hardly a bad experience really.  Being the calzone fiend that I am, it was only a matter of time before I tried one. Usually a hit or miss at most restaurants, I can only thank the food gods for teaching whoever the chefs are how to make a great calzone. Luckily it's in a build your style as well so you pickier eaters can be satisfied too! Highly recommended and my favorite thing on the menu next to the bruschetta.  Bills can get up there in price. Be prepared to spend around $15-25 a person depending on drinks.   If the recently trendy wine/bruschetta bar is your thing try La Bocca. In my opinion it trumps Postino's in almost every category, a great feat as Postino's is certainly no easy competition.",

The service was slow and it took about 20 minutes before we even got our waters.  The food was decent, but pretty bland and underwhelming. I had about 4 bites of my salad and pushed it to the side. My bf's pasta dish looked promising on the menu but ended up being too tart and watery. The waiter never asked if we liked our food/if we wanted anything to go/why I didn't attempt to eat that salad, lol.   I walked to Spinelli's down the street after and just got a slice of pizza.",

They even make their own mozzarella. The atmosphere is wonderful. My wife and I sat on the front terrace. The waitstaff was increadible. Very attentive, accomodative, and knowledgable. Our waitress' name was Brittany. We ordered a Bruschetta Board, and shared a Sicily Calzone with added mushrooms. Our Bruschetta Board was perfect. The bread is baked fresh at the Olive Mill in Queen Creek (an amazing local olive farm). The Calzone was ok. All of the ingredients were spectacular, but dish itself was off. The shallot was cut into very large slices, and the calzone was 70% sun dried tomatoes. I didn't taste sausage until 30% into the calzone. I spoke to the waitress about the calzone, and she said that some of the cooks were new and still learning. She said that the head chef had spoken to the cooks about the same issue before. Again, each ingredient was wonderful. The sausage, the sun dried tomatoes, the shallots, the dough, everything tasted great, but the execution needs work! That is why I have to give 4 out of 5 stars.",

Our waitress was very gracious and patient.   One tip - they've completely changed their drink menu so be sure to ask your waiter or waitress for their current selections.   We chose to split the bruschetta with the table and then ordered a pizza for each couple. As soon as the bruschetta came out we realized we would need another order. There were only two pieces of each type! (I expected four pieces of each type.) No big deal. Our waitress quickly brought out another board.   When the pizza came out it was perfectly done! We designed our own with artichokes on it and every bite was Devine. Between the pizza and sharing the bruschetta it was just the right amount of food.",

The crust was cooked perfectly, chewy on the outside and soft on the inside; and the toppings were well-balanced so as not to overwhelm the crust.

Started with the bruschetta - don't hesitate to get the Gorgonzola, it's made with pear and a balsamic glaze, absolutely fantastic.  Had the pasta Bolognese for the main, asked them to spicy it up for me and they killed it - cerrano peppers did the trick.  Well textured, light but flavorful, meat was tasty and just the right accompaniment.  Oh, by the way, wine list is great - had something spicy to start (Malbec) and a very nice Cab/??? Blend called the Riddler, terrific and well balanced.  Finished it off with a decaf espresso (meh) and tremendous coffee choc chip gelato - would def come back, especially for that Gorgonzola bruschetta...  Food/drink:  4.0 Service:  4.5 Ambience:  3.5",

I had a good feeling the minute our waters were served with a thin slice of cucumber on top, which gave the water a hint of its' flavor, that this was going to be good. Caprese Salad was spot on, so tasty. We chose 4 different bruschetta on plank-house made Pesto with Roma tomatoes were super fresh and delicious, Gorgonzola with pear, basil & balsamic reduction was a nice combo, Fresh ricotta with rosemary & honey was amazing, more like dessert, and my favorite Smoked prosciutto with fig/mascarpone/truffle oil melted in your mouth! We then ate the Truffled Mushrooms, tomatoes, mozzarella, fresh goat cheese, spinach tossed in a balsamic vinaigrette Pizza. Holy cow, as a New Yorker with great pizza everywhere, this one ranks right up there. Waiter and manager Tony were delightful!  In fact Tony gave us a piece of tiramisu that was one of the best we ever had!  When I visit my daughter in Phoenix, La Bocca will always be included in our culinary visits. Thank you for a great lunch!",

Our bartender was lovely enough to let us have taste of our choice of wine before making our final decision.  Something light and not too acidic was on our palates tonight.  To start antipasti was pretty good with your usual, salami, prosciutto, cheese, and olives and my favorite the elephant roasted garlic - thank goodness I wasn't planning to kiss anyone that night!  The pizza was darn good!  Anything with 3 meats is good right!? Atop with sausage, pepperoni, salami with roasted tomatoes, and 2 different cheese; mozzarella and fontina.  The dough was soft and the marinara sauce was aromatic and hot helping keep the ingredients warm and fresh to the taste.  The service was top notch overall and the ambiance is perfect for a lovely evening of wine and dine; plus if you don't want to break the bank.  The place had a classic decor feel with a modern twist and uptown look.  A plus side in my books! - Enjoy!",

    "text": "The Bruschetta Plank at La Bocca was amazing. My favorite of the four I tried was the Salami and Pesto. It was a burst of flavor in my mouth. My second favorite was the Sausage & Babaganoush. Then Prosciutto, Fig & Truffled Marscapone and Roasted Artichoke are tied for third.   I also have tried the Caprese which was good, but not extraordinary. It has big slices of basil, which in my opinion could of been left out.   Another item I have tried was the Bocca Trio Artisan Pizza. The ingredients were awesome, but I'm a crust person. The crust makes the pizza for me. This crust was crispy and bubbly which are pluses, but I didn't care for the flavor of the crust.   Lastly, I had the Tiramisu. It was a cheap dessert that hit the spot. However, it wouldn't make my top tiramisu list.   My overall experience was a delightful one. I have no huge complaints. Everything taste good, but if I ever come back, I would just order 2 planks of Salami and Pesto. SOOOO YUMMY!!!",

    "text": "Maybe, because of the reviews, I had high expectations, but the experience was less than 3 star quality. The server was not as attentive as I would expect in this type of establishment. I was often helped by other servers. I think 4 different people cared for our table in 90 minutes. The ambiance of the place was very nice. You feel a good vibe walking through the door. It was a little loud, but its Saturday night. What can you say?The food was lacking in a few things that would make it great. I ordered the goat cheese and pear salad. The portion size was good, but the pears were sliced into large pieces that I chose to break down. They would have been better sliced very thin on a mandolin, or simply in smaller pieces. I had the porco pizza. This had pulled pork, Serrano chilies, and caramelized onions. The size is more than enough. The hand tossed crust is very good, but could have benefited with a brushing of olive oil before serving, or at least having some olive oil on the table, and I could do it myself. It was pretty dry. Actually, the whole pizza was dry. The flavor of the pizza would have been great if there was sauce, like barbecue, or anything really. Apparently, their pizzas don't have sauce. To me you should call that a flat bread, and even that is pushing it. If you are looking for a great place for pizza, Mellow Mushroom is across the street. Wine bar or bruschetta board? Postino is still #1 in my book.",

This last week, the week of February 17 2014, I came down with a very nasty cold. It seems like it came on strong. I've though hard about where I might have picked it up. I'm concerned that it might have been a restaurant in downtown Tempe, AZ.  The restaurant is La Bocca on South Mill Street. Here's why I think it might have been caught there. I had ordered a draft beer with my meal. When I got the beer I noticed that the brew clung to the side of the glass much the way spit would cling to glass. While I though it was odd I also thought it might be a property of the beer. I now don't believe it was. I'm worried that they don't clean their beer glasses very well. Be careful of the draft beers.",

It has a super fresh fruity taste. I haven't tried a ton of Sangria, but I definitely would say this is the best I have had. We ordered some bruschetta and it was equally great. I tried both the pulled pork and the fresh mozzarella and can't decide which was better. Either way, I'd highly recommend trying one of their many bruschetta options if you stop in. I really wanted to try the other food, but I had a late lunch and just couldn't fit it. I plan on going back to try some of the other items on the menu that looked tempting.   I also liked that they had the option of table seating or areas to hang on couches. It gives it a cool vibe and I enjoyed the atmosphere. Our server was great, just the right amount of attentive. I'm looking forward to my next visit to check out the rest of the menu and enjoy the cool ambiance.",

Junior year Erin would have just died to have this place in my college town to cavort to with girlie-friendsies. Just something to take note of if you're in the dreaded \"middle-late twenties\" like me. (A term I coined because I refuse to grow up. Wah.)  It was all simply *OK.* The red sangria was *ok* (I know they had signs up about how their white sangria is award-winning and maybe I should have gone with that but...meh), the service was *ok*, the ambiance was *ok* (Trying a little too hard but no doubt impressing the 12-top of 21 year olds having a girls night out.)  The pizza was pretty tasty, but the Garden pizza, which sounded amazeballs with \"roasted zucchini, sauteed mushrooms, red onion, white cheddar, blue cheese and arugula tossed in balsamic reduction with white truffle oil\" was a bit underwhelming. Let's see...  - Zucchini, mushrooms and onion: BARELY there. Maybe one piece of each on each slice.  - White cheddar: Indiscernible   - Blue cheese: Yay, I could taste it! And I'm a big blue cheese fan so this was good  - Arugula: Yay, tons! I'm an arugula fangirl so this was another plus. \"tossed in a balsamic reduction?\" More like \"barely drizzled with bals vin.  - White truffle oil: None. Sniffle.  I could be persuaded to go back for the bruschetta boards and more wine, but as it stands it just wasn't the stellar experience it had the potential to be.",

I've tried pizzas, salads and bruschetta, and not once was I ever disappointed at La Bocca. Favorite items are the truffled mushroom pizza and the pear salad. Their sangria is awesome also. The vibe of the restaurant is nice/trendy, and they have a great patio for days that aren't too hot.",

It was so good that even though I was craving decent Mexican food after living in DC and working in Indiana, I was convinced by the smells emanating from this choice spot.  We had the Mediterranean sampler (top notch baba ganoush! and local olives) and the mushroom, truffle oil, and elephant garlic pizza.  Amazing.  The sangria was good, along with the Margaritas.  The staff was quick, efficient, and friendly.  You even get a bomb-ass iron skillet cookie ice cream if you check in online via the Yelp app.  Ugh!",

    "text": "When living in Tempe, this was my favorite place to go for some good food and good conversation. I think this place had the best bruschetta in town. When my husband and I came here, we typically shared a bruschetta plank and a salad.  If we were really hungry, we would order a second bruschetta plank. It's that good! Although I seemed to be in the minority among my friends, I strongly preferred La Bocca to Postino Wine Bar. This place has a nice, modern atmosphere and is very well-priced. This spot is also great because you can people watch on Mill Avenue while tucked away in this gem of a restaurant. In my opinion, this is by far the best place to go on Mill Avenue (Cafe Boa is much more expensive and not that good for their prices).",

The waitress wasn't lying when she said it was basically \"everclear and lemon zest.\" One of those, and my drink tab was fulfilled for the night.   I ordered the Bocca Trio (sans olives,) and I've got to say, it was the best pizza I've ever had. The meat was perfectly salty, the texture of it almost blended into the cheese. The sauce was delicately applied, and the crust had a nice, light char. There wasn't a single thing about it that wasn't pizza ecstasy.  If you haven't been here, please, go.   Seriously, get off of yelp and go!",

After your meal make sure you have the cookie and ice cream.  Freshly baked cookie of your choice topped with a scoop of ice cream of your choice.

    "text": "A little too snooty for its own good.  The ambiance seems cool, but it's kind of a cover up for the rest.  The food was well below mediocre: We got the bruchettas ($12)- which were just sliced pieces of bread mind you - no toasty toastness whatsoever, which were scantily clad with their respective toppings. The worst offender was the salmon bruschetta which had a mere sliver of smoked salmon. The antipasto plate ($16) started off on a high note with the prosciutto wrapped goat cheese and halved cherry tomato combo, but took a fall for the worse after the sampling the sliced cheese which looked like it came straight from Albertson's deli. Shoulda gone with another pizza or two instead. A complete rip off, and this is Tempe for chrissake. We ran out of bread and requested more - they charged us extra for this?!  The saving grace was the margarita pizza ($9) - the crust had a chewy yet crispy texture. The sauce was tangy and fresh. The mozzarella cheese was acceptable for a $9 pizza and the basil leaves were generously strewn across the pie. The wine was reasonably priced, we got a Spanish white for $28 and the cocktail menu seemed interesting. I had the cucumber martini ($9) for dessert - a little on the sweet side but well made.   Oppps and I forgot to mention the \"La Bocca\" salad was described as having grilled peaches, which was a selling point for me. When it arrived it came in two bowls and sans peaches. We were charged a split fee, even though we didn't ask for the salad to be split. We're Greek for chrissake we eat off each others plates.   If I'm back in Tempe, I don't think I'd come back here.",

    "text": "Voted one of the top 25 restaurants by Phoenix Magazine, this urban chic eatery lives up to its accolades.  \"La Bocca\" literally means \"the mouth.\"  What I love about this name is that in Buenos Aires, Argentina there is a district called \"La Boca,\" where the Italian immigrants settled at the turn of the century.  The name is perfect for a restaurant that serves an amalgam of Latin inspired fares.  The vivid photographs on the wall display an enchanting and colorful Italy, the large mural behind the bar is reminiscent of a Spanish royal portrait.  The colors of the dining and bar area are earthy, warm, and inviting - with dramatic splashes of red to infuse the senses.  Seated at the bar, I was impressed by the bartender's attentiveness, and his unmatched skill in making the best mojito this side of Miami.  This was a drink that I would expect to pay $14 for in North Scottsdale.  At La Bocca, the cocktails are $7 and worth the drive.  Their signature drink is the \"Clean Slate Martini,\" which was recommended by the amiable owner, Mr. Julian Wright.  He explained that the combination of Tanqueray, cucumber, and lime made this a smooth concoction, but I am so thrilled that I opted for the incredible blackberry mojito.  This being a pizzeria, the wine list is varied and interesting.  Many of the wines are Californian, but Spain is also well represented here.  For those who enjoy whites with their pizzas, I recommend their Senorio de Cruces Albarino (Spain) - perfect with salads, pizzas, or pastas.  For a real taste of Italy, get a bottle of their Zenato Rippassa del Valpolicello (Italy) - this is a well-rouned red that is served in every Italian restaurant in Europe.  There is only one place in Phoenix Metro where I believed I could find good bruschetta, (Postino) but a new contender has just entered the ring.  La Bocca offers the same - an assortment of bruschettas which can be ordered in combinations of four.  The selections range from prosciutto, mascarpone, fig, and truffle oil, to salami and house-made pesto.  And just like Postino, the rich flavors make your culinary heart melt with joy.  Pizza lovers can build their own pies here, with topping choices such as heirloom tomatoes, pulled pork, chili oil, and garlic.  There are seven signature pizzas on the menu, which can easily by devoured by one guest, and range from $9-$14.  There are also sandwhiches and salads available for those who do not like the pie.  If you are coming here strictly for wine, cozy up in one of the comfortable seats in the lounge.  Order a bottle of Spanish wine, and get the \"anti-asti\" plate.  This comes with a delectable assortment of salami, prosciutto wrapped goat cheese, manchego cheese, pesto, queen creek olives, roasted garlic, dijon, and artisan toast.  A spanish picnic, with the best pesto in town.  So, if that wasn't enough to pique your curiosity - here are some extra incentives.  Sundays and Mondays the bottles of wine are 1/2 off after 6:30 PM. Tuesdays enjoy your pizzas at 2-for-1 after 6:30 PM Thursdays, impress your date with live music Fridays and Saturdays has reverse Happy Hour from 10 PM to close",

And I'm glad I did. Because this time was better. Not awesome, but definitely better. Up from two stars to three.  Last time I ordered the seafood pizza, which was Gross, which I didn't even see on the menu anymore. Hmmm... wonder what happened there.  This time I ordered the Oven Roasted Shrimp and Pesto Sandwich, which was quite tasty. Kind of tasted like bruschetta actually, but with pesto and shrimp. Which was fine with me - I love bruschetta. Bread was lightly toasted, shrimp were plump and juicy. Choice of sides included cole slaw, couscous and chips. I got the chips, and they weren't bad, just your basic restaurant potato chips. My friend ordered the Turkey & Brie Sandwich with the couscous. She enjoyed the sandwich, but not the couscous so much. It was served cold, which I don't think she was expecting.  Service was definitely better this trip - friendlier and much more efficient. We were in and out in about an hour. Weird thing was we were the only ones there. I mean, I know it's Monday, but still - only one table between 11 & 12? That can't be good.",

Because of that it is getting a 4th star but the food and drink only warrant 3.   Lets just call La Bocca what it is...it's  a starter wine bar for college kids. The wine list is less than impressive and anyone that actually enjoys drinking wine wouldn't settle for a wine bar with a wine list that is dominated by wine from California. Yes, names like \"Little Black Dress\" are cute but this isn't a quality selection. But the kiddies have got to start somewhere when they are learning about wine and that is the purpose of La Bocca.   As far as the food goes...well... the Mediterranean salad is good. Get that. I can't say that I would suggest the bruschetta. The flavors are lacking in creativity and they are often poorly constructed. The pizza is ok, but like I said, stick to that salad.   Should you find yourself on Mill you could do much, much worse. If you are looking for a wine bar in the vein of Postino, Cheuvront, or Tapino, think again. You are on Mill after all.",

    "text": "I think people generally go to a pizzeria and bar type place for three basic things:  1) Food 2) Drinks 3) Service  Since I could get neither food nor drink, I can only speak to service.  And I think I just did.  I am not exaggerating here. I was in La Bocco for an hour before a server approached. While the pizza looked fabulous, I'd heard people talking about getting theirs 30, 45 minutes or more after they ordered. So I opted for a beer.  30 minutes after that, with only one fleeting glimpse of the server, I left.  Yes, it was crowded. Yes I was there for the Ignite Phoenix after-party. But it's not like it was standing room only, and they had previous notice we were coming.  Walking out after an hour and a half to find your car towed (clearly not La Bocca's fault, and not a factor in the one star review) makes for a pretty lousy experience.   Too bad, looked like a cool place. But seriously, it's not that difficult to pour a beer.  And don't park, ever, on the southeast corner of Mill and 7th street.  UPDATE: I just had to stop back by and give props to the owner Julian, who contacted me via Yelp and apologized for my poor experience. No excuses, no fluff. That's commendable, and the right way to do business.   I'll have to go back and take him up on that drink offer....",

    "text": "I haven't been to Arizona since more fingers than I can count. I'm here for an educational conference - but decided to arrive a few days early to scope out the area.  After a day of travel and getting settled into my hotel room (review to come later) - I took a shuttle to a section of downtown Tempe called the Mill Avenue District which is adjacent to ASU.   My stomach's growling, my blood sugar is dropping as I walk along the street trying to figure out what to eat for dinner.   I'm getting disheartened as nothing seems good, then I see the sign for La Bocca. The menu that's posted on the window is limited to pizza, sandwiches and salads - but I'm at the point where I'm starting to drool just by reading the menu.  The interior of the restaurant is simply decorated, but luxurious. The only downside (at least for me) was the thumping music - and I really wanted a quiet dinner. I asked to be seated on the patio, but the cacophonous sound of passing traffic made dining less than quiet. Oh well - I was hungry - and no one was going to get in the way of me and food at this point.  I ordered the prosciutto pizza - a 10\" single pizza with artichoke hearts, fontina cheese and marinara sauce. The pizza was thin crust and a little soggy - but I could taste the freshness of the marinara sauce, which was soooo very delicious! I rounded out my meal with a side green salad which usually doesn't come along with the pizza (only with the sandwiches). So, note, if you want a side salad with your pizza, it isn't on the menu - you need to ask.   Although the waitress was kind enough to explain the wine specials, I was in the mood for a beer. So, I washed everything down with a glass of Four Peaks Kilt Lifter (yes, you read that right) amber draught beer which was smooth and rich tasting.   You know when you get to that point in a meal that you realize that you just can't eat another bite? I was ready to lie down right there and take a nap.  I'm definitely going to sleep well tonight...",

    "text": "I was first introduced to La Bocca at a 9/9/09 \"Dress to the Nines\" event where they hosted a very large food/wine tasting. Even though I only had four small hors d' oeuvres and tasted 4 small glasses of wine, I knew I would be back!   Since then I have absolutely fell in love with the menu here, the Med plate is particularly notable.  An abundant assortment of warm (local!) olives, a block of crumbly feta garnished with roasted red pepper, huge portions of hummus and baba ghanoush, and two kinds of bread load up this plate making it an awesome appetizer to share (or just have as a meal yourself!).  Then the bruschetta...wow, love the combinations they offer! And they cut them neatly in half so you can share easily. My favorites are the roasted garlic/goat cheese/arugula and the roasted artichoke/spinach/red pepper. For pizza I have only tried the truffled mushroom, and while very good, I think I will try a different pizza next time. But for me this place is all about the apps. I recommend just getting an assortment including bruschetta and you will not be disappointed, especially if you love simple ingredients in mouth watering combinations.  I have noticed a lot of reviews complain about service, so I just want to give props to one waitress that really stood out for me. I wish I had her name but she is petite with a short blonde bob and glasses. She was so friendly and on top of things, she made great recommendations and checked on us frequently despite a very busy night.   I don't drink wine, so I cannot comment on the selection, but La Bocca is definitely worth a try for the food alone :)",

    "text": "I've been to La Bocca twice now. The first time a few months back didn't warrant a full review . I was there to hang out with a large group and had a cocktail before leaving. I did enjoy myself that evening and the atmosphere of La Bocca. A bit different than many other places on or just off Mill that cater more toward the college scene.  La Bocca is a nice change of pace.  Tonight, I really experienced La Bocca on a couples outing. We had a party of 8. We went here for food, drink and hanging out.  I thought the food was very good. My wife and I started out with some bruschetta planks.  I really enjoyed the housemade pesto with fresh roma tomato and mozzarella, basil, roma tomato,  olive oil & balsamic. You get to choose 4 different options for your plate. After we finished, I wish I had more!  My wife and I also split a margarita pizza. The pizza was nicely baked and tasted really good. I wish there was a little more cheese on the pizza though. After the first bite, all the cheese came off and was just left with dough and sauce. The pizza reminded me of the pizza I had in Italy last summer  Food wise, La Bocca hit's a home run. I think the food is well done, fresh and high quality.  As for beverages. Beside the various wines, there is a bar and beer. On Monday nights, most bottles of wine are half off.  I wanted a cocktail and had a mojito. The drink was okay. Not the worst mojito, but definitely not the best. There was way too much ice in the glass. Not my wisest $7 spent. Should have just had a nice glass of red wine instead!   Here are some issues I had with La Bocca: -The bruschetta took as long to come to our table as the pizza did. I didn't expect the food to appear instantly, but the food should have been out in 10 minutes. The bruschetta orders came out closer to 30 minutes.   -The front door and patio doors were left open and the people smoking on the patio carried inside. Not a fan of this at all, especially while I eat.  -The service was up and down. Some areas were really good while other areas were sub par. Water came quickly, wine and other drinks came out a bit slower than they should.  Food delivery was slow (read above).  The server forgot about one check that was paid in cash and  3/4 of the table received their check and receipt quickly. The other couple was completely forgotten above for an extended period of time and caused us to stay longer than expected.   Overall, I liked the place and would give this establishment 3.5 stars. The rating could go up 4 stars (or maybe higher) with some of the inconveniences improved upon above.",

I work in Tempe and was sooo excited when a new nice looking place opened on Mill Ave.  For all of those of you who've spent time on Mill, you know it is somewhat lacking in the area of fine dining, or even fair dining for that matter.  Anyways, we went there pretty consistently for a while after it opened, mainly because it was new and we were all deathly tired of the same things for lunch every day, and it started off alright.  Alright is literally the best compliment I could give this place.  The pizzas and salads were OKAY, the sandwiches pretty gnarly to be honest, and it was all incredibly overpriced.  That said, we are a fickle bunch so \"alright\" worked for us for a few months.   That is until La Bocca took a HUGE slide downwards.  All of a sudden our lunches, that solely consisted of salad and pizza started taking a full hour and a half to get through!  How it takes 90 minutes to shell out a couple of salads and pizzas I will never understand.  As more time passed, our orders were consistently screwed up, the wait staff was terrible, never refilling water/soft drinks or even bothering to come over and explain why after 60 minutes, NONE of our food had come out!  After several consecutive trips of service like that, we crossed La Bocca off of our list for good.  It was a bummer.  I had very high hopes for what looked like a cute little pizza/wine bar/cafe at first.  But spending almost $20 at lunch for a salad and pizza that take over an hour when you're one of 12 people in the restaurant?  No thanks...",

He gave us the run down of what the specials were as we arrived during Happy Hour. We chose to get the bruschetta, pick 2 for $5. We tried the Brie cheese and sopressata. We weren't fans of either but the bread was perfect.  We also ordered the chicken limone and built our pizza. For the pizza; mushrooms, fresh spinach, heirloom tomatoes, red onion, and chicken. Both were amazing!  Even our 2 year old daughter loved it! We also had the tiramisu which was heavier than most tiramisu I've had. It was good, just heavy! We had coffees and earlier with the meal, the mister had an old fashion which was also very tasty.  I would definitely come back here to try the different bruschetta boards and entrees.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I love wine. We love trying different wines and pairing them with food. When we choose a restaurant they have to have good wine.   We went to labocca for the first time on a Tuesday night. Got there a little late about 830 and it was quite slow but picked up a bit as we sat there. Our waiter started out very attentive but then got very busy which we were completely understanding of. We were happy to be out in the beautiful Arizona evening weather and enjoying some wine and each other's company. We asked to taste several wines and decided on a bottle. We also had a pizza and their Bolognese. The pizza had good flavor but was quite under cooked, a bit mushy. The Bolognese was very subpar. I had it here about two years ago and really liked it a lot.  It even had the hint of cinnamon that a lot of restaurants don't seem to include. This was unrecognizable from that first experience. It seemed like they scraped the bottom of the pot and gave us what was left. Overall it was an ok experience. The waiter informed us that Sunday and Monday they had half off bottles and there was a bottle we really wanted to try but didn't want to spend $88 that particular night. Fast forward to the following Sunday. We strolled over after the sixth street market around 3:30 pm to have that coveted bottle of wine. My boyfriend wanted to try a couple others though just in case.  We asked for two samples and when he came back my boyfriend asked to try one other one. He huffed a bit and when he came back sat the sample on the table and said that's all for you two. Needless to say, we were taken aback to say the least. We were the only people in the entire restaurant. It took them another 10 minutes to bring us a menu and water. He seemed annoyed with us the entire evening. I forgot to mention that this was the same waiter that we had and liked on Wednesday.The experience was really awful. It felt like we were intruding on their fun or something. As I mentioned we were the only people there so they clearly just wanted to do their own thing and not wait on customers. It was such a poor experience that I don't think we'll be back.  I'm very sad to have had this experience because Tempe doesn't have a whole lot of grown up choices for dinners. It's a very college oriented town when it comes to food and drink. La Boca certainly has the opportunity to be a great restaurant. Their wine list is fantastic but the service there is so bad. The food is not good either. I wonder how they stay in business because they're hardly ever busy. I wish I could say that we'll be back but sadly a can not.",

Our server was very friendly, but seemed a little inexperienced, or perhaps really distracted (example, he would \"go grab that water really quickly and then come back to take your drink order\" and left every glass, plate, bowl on the table as he brought more.) But, he was friendly and attentive.  We shared the warm olives appetizer. Pretty standard olives in a light oil and bread; nothing wrong with it, nothing outstanding.  I got the Roasted Garlic pizza and my friend got the Porco and we split them. The Roasted Garlic has lots of garlic, not an off-putting taste but you definitely see the huge slices/chunks. Unfortunately, I didn't think it had enough other things going on. It was actually kind of bland considering the number of ingredients on it. The Porco was much better, spicy and pretty delicious.  Overall, not my favorite pizza place, but the atmosphere is nice so maybe I'd stop back in for a drink (probably only during happy hour...wines weren't cheap!)",

Starting off, we ordered the Antipasti Board which came with a combination of meats and cheese. This was the highlight of our meal. The board included prosciutto-wrapped goat cheese - incredibly tasty! We also enjoyed the pesto sauce that was served with the toasted bread.  For our main courses, we ordered the Chicken Pesto Pizza and the Prosciutto Alfredo! The Alfredo plate came with a side of Caesar Salad. The dressing used for the salad was very bland and had no taste.   The pizza was baked to perfection! It had the perfect amount of chicken and pesto sauce. No complaints. The Prosciutto Alfredo was also the right amount of cheese, paste and prosciutto. I was worried that it wouldn't have enough prosciutto but it came with the right portion.   Overall, we enjoyed our visit to La Bocca! I would definitely visit again if I ever return to the Tempe area!",

However, I'm always willing to give a restaurant another chance.   Appetizer: Bruschetta Board I ordered all the ones with cheeses, because who doesn't love cheese? My favorite was the traditional.  Entree: Truffled Mushroom Pizza I'm not a big fan of mushrooms, and I thoroughly enjoyed this pizza. I recommend ordering marinara on the side because it's a no sauce pizza. You could taste how fresh the tomatoes were in the sauce!  Dessert: Warm Chocolate Chip Cookie with Vanilla Ice Cream It was more cake-y than cookie but it was still a tasty way to round out my meal. The table next to me got the gelato flight...that's definitely for next time.   The food was delicious, and the service was wonderful. I highly recommend this place. I'll be back with my next pizza/calzone/gelato craving!",

We decided on this place from the Yelp reviews. We came through the door and noticed it was not busy at all but no one was there to greet us upon entering. We waited about 3-4 minutes for a young lady to seat us about 8 feet away from the entrance. Our server was nice, and friendly. We ordered 2 caesar salads and a pizza to split. The salads came out pretty quickly but the pizza took FOREVER. We almost got up and walked out. I would estimate a good 60 minute wait for a pizza. Dont know who fumbled but the server made it right and did not charge us. The pizza dough was good and the topping was Brussel Sprouts. Pretty good but no sauce. Only 2/3rds of the pizza had toppings. It was dark inside and music was so loud it was hard to carry on a conversation. I would come back again despite these exceptions. People make mistakes but they owned up to it and made it right and thats all that matters. Our server was very apologetic. Thanks!",

    "text": "I have been to this location twice now and both times I became sick after eating the Caesar salad. After eating dinner here, I have woken up in the middle of the night with my stomach burning, and up came the salad.  Also, both times I have gone to this location I have had a lack of immediate service, and the tiniest pours of wine. This is all really unfortunate because I like that they have a decent selection of wine and whiskey. I will not return seeing as this is been one of the worst dining experiences in my life.  Not to mention, I had a flight today and due to my sickness I have to reschedule. Therefore this dinner turned from $100 to $250 for the reschedule.",

    "text": "Food here was pretty good -- but then again we'd waited so long, anything would taste good....service was disappointing (see time stamps/end).  Starting with the positives- the truffle mushroom pizza was really actually pretty delicious. I'm very picky about truffle oil, after I had a very poor experience that turned me off. Anything too overbearing and I won't eat it. This is a good level of truffle oil. The goat cheese is a good balance to the truffle oil, and the basil is light and complementary.  The pasta bolognese though....umm, strange. There was a very clove(?)-y taste to it that was not expected. Maybe that's not my taste which I get. However, the pappardelle (oh, I forgot I'm not a pappardelle person so bad combo maybe) was nowhere close to al dente. It was soggy. OH and lukewarm - but I'll chalk that up to us having to wait 45 minutes for a pasta. The garlic bread with this was the highlight, but also - very lukewarm.   Now service......ok so it was a Friday night. The place wasn't packed, but I guess it was fairly full. Still, my friends walked in and were seated right away. Within 10 minutes of ordering, we get our house salads. Following that - nothing for 35 minutes. idk about you, but I like to eat my salads with my entrees and multiple waiters kept coming to try and take my salad away as I waited another 35 minutes for my pasta/pizza. My friend nearly finished her pinot noir that she had ordered specifically to go with the bolognese as well so I guess you could say we were unimpressed with the wait time.  The part that disappointed me most was seeing multiple parties come in after us, get their food, and LEAVE before we got our food/as our food just arrived. So while I really wanted to like this place, I cannot say I will be coming here again. IF i were to come back, I would order differently and just stick with the pizza though - so keep that in mind if you swing by.",

We had sooooo many choices on the food menu we had a hard time deciding on what to order. We started of with the Mediterranean plate, which was fabulous!!! It has this basil humus that is so flavorful and creamy, you seriously can't get enough!!! Next up was the planks of bruschetta!!! We couldn't decide which ones we wanted so between 3 of us we ordered 2 planks! My absolute hands down favorites were the honey and ricotta, Mozzarella, and pesto!!! Oh my.... it's the next day and I am already craving these again!!!!   Our server was extremely friendly and helpful ( Bri)! We absolutely loved her!!! She made our girls night absolutely fabulous with her attention to detail and knowledge, thank you!  I know before heading home I will be returning and highly recommend anyone else coming here and trying a plank or pasta!!! Bon appetit",

The pizza is just okay for me, I prefer their appetizers and salads more. The harvest chop salad is pretty awesome, I keep coming back for that when I want something lighter.

It is a such a great bottle of wine for a reasonable price.  It is always nice when you can find an affordable wine that we enjoy! For the first time we got dessert here last night.  We ordered the pizza cookie, and while it wasn't as big as I expected it was perfect portion size for two.  I only wish they had put an extra scoop of ice cream on there since there were two of is splitting it.

I saw La Bocca Urban Pizzeria down the way and I thought Pizza? Sure, why not.  When we first walked in, it was kinda awkward because I didn't see anybody who worked there except for the bartender. He told us that we could seat ourselves so we did and eventually some menus followed. The decor had a modern feel to it and they had indoor tables, outdoor patio seating, and lounge seating as well.   Looking over the menu the Truffles Mushroom Pizza stood out. I loooove truffle and I loooove mushroom (on pizza). Once I saw it, my mind was already made up... that's what we were getting. We also got the Dayton Caesar Salad. When the food came out, both looked very appetizing. The pizza was unlike any I've ever seen because it was covered with leafy greens on top. It was almost like a salad on top of a pizza. I took a bite and it was really good. I chowed down and by the end of my 3 slices, I still wanted more. On the other hand, the caesar we ordered kinda sucked. I don't know how you mess up a caesar salad but this one was not worth getting at all.   As of right now, La Bocca has won me over with their pizza. It was delicious! Just stay away from the Caesar... (you have been warned)",

I really like it overall, but the ambition to make the distinction from the surrounding atmosphere does inject a uneasy feel of pretentiousness. That is the negative. Besides that I feel that La Bocca does what it should, even thought it doesn't compete with the really good wine places, nor the really eclectic cheese and/or bruschetta creators.. but they don't need to. Location is the key here.   The baba ganoush is what is on the must-list, and they have both decent wines and decent brews. The brews are not strangers to the avid beer drinker, but enough for the level of cuisine offered. I much rather have a little place with limited ambition and doing what they do excellently, instead of stretching their ambition too thin. Thank you for that LBUP.  At my last visit I sat lounging outside to have a private conversation with a friend while being entertained by the passersby eclecticism and spirit. This is a gem for that purpose, due to the statement this place has on that side of the street.. yet not clogging up the free flow of people and modern student culture that is streaming just inches from your consumeristic haven.  I will return again, and most probably again.",

So, to summarize, slow, error-prone service and mediocre food in nouvelle cuisine portions.  I'll never go back.",

It definitely has a kick to it. After washing all that deliciousness down with a few glasses a wine then order the truffle mushroom pizza. You definitely can't go wrong with anything you order here.",

We started out with a bruschetta plate for an appetizer. The different flavors we sampled were each executed perfectly and a great preview to our pizzas.  I had the truffled mushroom and sampled a slice of the chicken pesto. The chicken was my favorite but the truffled mushroom was also very good. Lots of flavor and really good thin crust.  The table went through 2 carafes of sangria which I heard was outstanding as I did not partake. My vodka and soda was a bargain at $5. I would absolutely go back for another meal.",

    "text": "We've been to this place a couple times and each time I enjoy the food. Usually I get the Bocca trio pizza which is always good. I've had both wine and a mojito from this place and both are good (the mojito was crisp and refreshing) although I think they're just a tad overpriced. We recently went to celebrate Valentines Day a day late (we went the Saturday after, due to our schedules). Made the reservation and got a table no problem, and it was busy. The downfall was when my girlfriend and I both wanted pasta, and were informed that they ran out. Ran out? Of pasta? At an Italian restaurant? We both found this a bit ridiculous. Still, the meal I got was good. My girlfriend was less impressed, and stated that she won't be going back. The salad she got was the same amount as her glass of wine, which didn't sit well with her. I refuse to let one bad experience ruin my outlook and will give it another shot.   I enjoy the atmosphere in the restaurant, and think it's cool that they project indie films onto the back wall throughout the time you're there. My only complaint is that each time we go, we're always seated towards the front of the restaurant, so much so that I feel we never actually get to experience the complete atmosphere, as we're always located by the front door, or a window. I'm not sure if that makes sense, although it does to me.  The dessert was good, a baked pan cookie with icecream on top. Nothing too crazy but good nonetheless. All in all, I'll go back, and hopefully next time they'll have pasta because I'd like to try out different dishes.",

One of them was pesto and tomatoes and I couldn't tell which one that was b/c I tasted zero pesto on any of them. All of them were basically french bread with a tiny amt. of toppings for $12. Tried Sicily pizza. It was good I suppose. I was still hungry after splitting the bruchetta and pizza. They are thin crust and not much cheese or sauce. These pizzas have no red sauce. I wouldn't go back. If you try it I would only recommend going on Tuesdays during happy hour. Half off wine, beer and most liquors AND it's buy one pizza get one free although the alcohol is expensive ($8-10 for a small glass of wine).",

I knew it was going to be a good night when she warned my friend that the Lemoncillo was made with Everclear and very strong. Rather than bringing the drink, she suggested that my friend try the lemoncillo before ordering and brought a small glass of lemoncillo and orangecillo. She was right - both of the \"cillo's\" were very strong. I decided on a glass of red sangria and my friend a mojito. Both were delicious!   As for food, I ordered the bruschetta and was impressed. Out of the 4 types of bruschetta I ordered, I recommend the proschutto bruschetta. I'm a huge fan of salmon so I ordered the smoked salmon one as well, but was slightly disappointed. Both of my friends ordered pizzas (because on Tuesdays they have a 2 for 1 pizza special) and both of them seemed to enjoy their meals as much as, if not more than I. I anticipate going back soon, especially after seeing two girls next to me get the cookie dessert!  Overall, highly recommended!",

It comes with sauteed mushrooms, roasted tomatoes(I personally hate tomatoes and go w/out these), goat cheese, fresh spinach lightly tossed in balsamic vinaigrette and a little white truffle oil for good measure.

    "text": "I have been to La Bocca about 6 times, and each time this place has been very good. I have tried several pizzas, several salads, the antipasto plate, and the bruschetta. All have been really tasty. So I went here tonight with the BF before we went to see Stephen Hawking for his birthday (the BF's, not SH's). We went for happy hour, intending to just get a bruschetta plank, but ended up being super hungry and getting a bunch of food. We were seated right away, which was nice. For happy hour, all wine and beer by the glass is half off. We ordered some wine, I got the Riesling and he got the pinot grigio. I really liked the riesling and he liked the pinot, but I wasn't a fan. To each his own though. So we ordered the bruschetta plank with the prosciutto, fig, and mascarpone, the tomato, mozz, basil, and balsamic, the pulled pork and peston, and the garlic, arugula, and goat cheese. They were all excellent. So in comparison to Postino, I'd say these are on par (with the tomato and mozz one being way better here). Plus we didn't have to wait forever for the food. Each piece of bruschetta is smaller than the ones at postino though. We ended up ordering a margherita pizza. This was so good, it was exactly what I expect in a good margherita pizza. It had whole leaves of basil and the mozz clearly came from a ball of cheese and not shredded cheese. It all tasted really fresh. I thought this pizza was much better than the Marg. I got at Classic Italian Pizza a few weeks ago. The crust was a lot less burnt and the toppings tasted fresher. Then, cuz it's the BF's Bday, we got an order of tiramisu. Mmmmm this was so good! The tiramisu did not have an overwhelming alcohol flavor, but a very light coffee flavor that was very tasty. It had a really good sized piece of tiramisu with two little wafers in it and some chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce on the side. It was excellent! This was one of the best meals I've had in awhile, and I don't know if it was the wine, but this was also the best meal I've had at La Bocca.",

Our favorite is the Margherita, then it's the mushroom and goat cheese one... it just oozes with flavor!!   The salads are very good as well   The Peroni on draft rocks my world!!! It is soo cold! Plus, it is served in Peroni beer glasses which are kept so cold, that I have a beer Icicle for a minute or two!! Their Mojitos are simply addicting! The restaurant always has great ambience, and is visually stimulating as well.  On Thursdays they have some sort of live entertainment and on Sunday nights they show a movie... kinda weird and frankly boring to me, but hey, do whatchugottado!   I walk to it, but what's even better is you can get there via light rail! Try it out!",

    "text": "Very hip pizza and wine bar on Mill Ave. If you are looking for a grown up, but hip place in the heart of Mill, then this is the place. This place has a great patio area that is nice and typically far enough away from the Mill Kids/Bums, so you can enjoy a nice AZ day or evening without being asked for change. Inside is very hip and at night it has a very hip, chic, romantic, True wine bar feel to it. I like to sit inside or out.   The food is very dependable and there are many options. The Farmer's Salad comes highly recommended from my wife, but the last two times they have run out of peaches. It is light, but packs nice flavor. We never get too upset when someone runs out of a seasonal product (i.e. peaches), because it gives us comfort that they use fresh ingredients. I'd recommend you go with a Pizza and Salad or Pizza and Bruschetta. The bruschetta is very solid and they use nice oils and seasonal veggies and great basil.  You have a couple of good bruschetta options (something that I am not sure why more places do not offer).  It is not quite as good as Postino bruschetta, but pretty darn close. The pizzas are the same the margherita is a safe, but solid choice. Again they use nice good ingredients and the oil is great. The crust is nice and thin and crispy with the right balance of chewy.   I highly recommend you pair any meal with a glass of wine, but if you are going to enjoy a full evening and truly embrace the ambiance, settle in with a bottle. Another tip Sundays and Mondays are half price bottle bringing the prices back down to want we'd pay at a wine shop.",

That was my first obstacle.  Next I had to get it delivered to her.  I called and explained my situation to Toni the Manager and informed him that I wanted to get a caprese salad over to my fiancee who is currently on travel for work as a surprise.  To top it off, I am calling from out of state.  Tony sighed and said, \"you know what, we normally don't do this; however, I cannot make any promises.  One of my servers does live in the area and I could ask if they would be willing to do this.\"  There was hope.  Within 2 hours, Tony called me back and informed me that his server who was getting off would deliver it for me.  I've personally have never eaten here but through recommendation from another manager from another restaurant, who has eaten here, says this place has awesome food.  Tony, you are an employee that makes CEO decisions and I pray that you achieve your purpose in life.  Ps. A delivery service may not be a bad idea eh??  Cherish,  Joseph.",

Thankfully, La Bocca was open until 12am on a Saturday.  When you first walk in it feels very down to earth, laid back and kind of artsy.  I really loved the designs, it was interesting to look at.  The lady who came to our table was very friendly and got our drinks promptly.  I had the Orange Blossom Martini, delicious!  My boyfriend had something (sorry I can't remember) very strong, but refreshing.  It had the aroma of lime and you can also enjoy the taste of the lime, possibly sugar and very strong alcohol.  The waitress said it had Everclear in it and that's why it was so strong.  We enjoyed the Bruschetta , Pesto Pasta and a 'make your own pizza.'  The whole reason I love this place is the AMAZING Bruschetta !  The flavors were so rich and amazingly put together.  I will definitely be going back here.  The ambiance, drinks, food, customer service was all great.  It's not too pricey, but if you want to enjoy the Bruschetta (pick four) be ready to dish out $12 buck for that appetizer.  We did not get to enjoy the deserts, but they sounded great.  Maybe next time ;).  My pasta had a strong taste of feta, which I didn't mind, but the Bruschetta stole the show for me.  I'll be happy to revisit!",

The happy hour wine selection was pretty strong, and I enjoyed our bruschetta appetizer quite a bit -- alllllmost as good as Postino.  The pizzas and salad left something to be desired, but did the trick for a quick pre-show dinner.  The atmosphere was quite nice (dig the music!) and bonus points for olives from Queen Creek Olive Company.",

We didn't have a rez, so we were given the option to wait at the bar until our table was ready, and we ended up just staying there for the entire service, cuz we usually like eating at the bartop anyways! Ordered a bottle of wine to share, we were both provided a few tasters, and the bartender was really knowledgeable about the wines - was able to provide us with great feedback about the wines, and the dinner menu items as well. Gave us great recommendations, we loved everything! Bruschetta was wonderful - fig, marscapone and prosciutto was the best. We split the chicken ceasar which I liked, but my bf thought was so-so, and a pizza that was on special (Four Seasons), which was awesome! My only gripe about the pizza is that the crust part is kinda big, and I really love when the \"stuff\" on the pizza goes all the way to the edges so it totally maximizes the stuff-to-crust ratio (my bf says I'm the minority for liking my pizza that way lol, he loved the crust part, but hey! I'm from Chicago and that's how I like my thin crust!). Both bartenders were fast, and attentive to all of the guests at the bar (I don't think anyone had to ask for a drink, or a water refill). Their names were Dulia and Melissa, both very attentive, kind, and had great recommendations ~ great service, will def be back!",

I highly suggest the turkey/brie sandwich, prices are not bad either.  But, while you are there the #1 thing you have to try are the WARM QUEEN CREEK OLIVES app!!!! best deal ever...for $3 you get a bowl filled with locally grown delicious olives dressed in olive oil of course, and a plate of crusty bread! amazing.  also, take note of the great ambiance. I think La Boca has really nice decor/vibe. The lighting at night is great for date/relaxing, and the tables are simple and classy.

(Um, also guilty...)  But I way digress! Streets like this also always have a couple more decorous dining establishments for when the parental units are in town -- which is exactly what I happen to have stumbled upon in this place, and perfect because if there's anything I love as much as edgy \"hippie chic,\" it's decorum.  I treated myself to my one sit-down meal during a week of travel/ being late for everything/ conference bagged lunches, and can't think of much more to have asked for than sitting outside on their little street-side patio with my glass of rose and my truffle oil pizza.

The only thing I would say is that some Tuesdays when it's slammed and it's two-for-one pizza night the pizzas are not as good and come out burnt. I would go another night.",

The food was yummy- I highly recommend (along with everyone else that has reviewed already) the bruschetta. Also, the Sangria was delicious! The fruit was obviously very fresh. The only thing I might have changed was the fact that we had only one server for a reservation of 15. She got a little overwhelmed (which, was understandable... since we were a big group)... but, I had made reservations. Besides that, the service really was great, and I did not regret my decision for choosing this place.",

    "text": "It was my first time at La Bocca and I was pleasantly surprised. Mill Avenue is not my usual preferred place to dine but after a fabulous performance at the gammage, I was hungry! So hungry that I couldn't wait to drive to eat. My friend recommended La Bocca because apparently, she used to frequent this establishment for happy hour quite frequently for their half off wine by glass. I will have to take advantage of that another time. Tonight I was all about food, although I did end up ordering one of their malbecs. I just can't pass up trying a new malbec.   We ended up ordering the plank of brucetta (pulled pork, roasted garlic & spinach, salmon, goat cheese & ?). My friend warned me that it was not like Postino's brucetta, which then I was immediately discouraged but took a chance anyway. I was very happy with the risk! The bread was not too overbearing and the toppings of fresh ingredients were plentiful that made me longing for more. We then ordered the sicily pizza. I give them credit for trying to make their pizza different than other pizzas in Phoenix. Their crust is much larger and poofier and the dough is super thin in the middle of the pizza. The body of the pizza is so thin that the oil and topping juices seeped through and turned the pizza slightly soggy. Not my favorite but because the toppings were so fresh and flavorful, I didn't mind it.   If I ever want to dine in Mill Ave, I will definitely come back to La Bocca's.",

    "text": "I live in downtown Phoenix; Boyfriend lives in Tempe. After two years of getting our date on at places like Postino's, St. Francis, the Rokerij, Dick's Hideaway, and Padre's, we decided we needed a Tempe date place. Friday night we decided to check out La Bocca.  In short. it's okay. Nice environment, good service, pretty good pizza, and great ice cream flight for dessert. But this is tempered with over priced wine (almost $20 for two glasses of HOUSE wine?), small pieces of bruschetta (tasty - scratch that - REALLY tasty, but the slices are teeny tiny), and it's on Mill, so most of the other patrons are frat guys trying to impress sorority sisters, and if you're lucky, you'll get to see a couple of Greeks making out. Yum? There was a table of older people tucked into a corner who didn't seem to mind the age gap, but in my late-20s, I was not very much amused.  The good service, cool atmosphere, tasty bruschetta choices, and creative, thin crust pizza get this place three stars. The over priced wine and bruschetta (seriously, we usually get bruschetta at Postino's for the same price for 4 people, and then I am too full to order dinner, but at La Bocca I was ready for round two after my half of the plate), and the fact that it's on Mill keeps it from 5 stars. We both really wanted to like this place, but I think next time we want to get dressed up and go out on the East side, we'll try somewhere else. In the meantime, we'll stick to downtown.",

The wine list was amazing, and there was also a decent selection of beers on tap. If you're just planning on going out for drinks and appetizers with a small group, I recommend sitting in the \"lounge areas\" so you don't have to wait. My bf and I went for dinner, and our server was great. She was very attentive and made excellent suggestions. We got the antipasti plate for a starter. Everything was tremendous, but the highlights were the prosciutto-wrapped goat cheese and the house pesto spread. Both fantastic and unique! For our main course, I ordered the smoked prosciutto Alfredo (which had orange zest that truly took it to the next level!) and my boyfriend ordered a build your own pizza. We shared our meals; the portions weren't HUGE but we had enough leftover for one lunch the next day. Finally, we couldn't resist getting the chocolate chip cookie for dessert. We shared, but it was small enough for one sugar-craving individual :) I would definitely recommend la Bocca!",

I wasn't really sure where to start - but I was lucky to be with a date that was willing to show me.   Honestly, I love La Bocca SO much it's a romantic affair! I have spent many of nights on the patio, enjoying glass after glass of wine with good company.   Before I go on to rant about the food, I MUST talk about the decor. There is nothing fancy about La Bocca. Yet, for some reason I always feel the need to put on a cute dress before walking (should I say running!) over. La Bocca reminds me of a little wine bar you would find tucked behind a corner in Paris. The ceilings are high, the lights are always low and the style is eclectic. I love the random artwork and the walls of windows.   When I first found La Bocca I had very little wine knowledge. Now, three years later I know the menu like the back of my hand! The staff is always more than willing to offer tasters and educate me about what flavors I should be looking for, the body etc.  The menu is small, however everything on it is superb! In my opinion you would be doing yourself a disservice if you miss the goat cheese & pear salad. Crafted together with a spring mix, sweet candied walnuts, fresh cranberries and a balsamic vinaigrette, it is just plain amazing. I have tried many many many times to remake it and for some reason can't get it to be half as good as La Bocca.",

But the pizza came out with tomatoes sauce as we'll and only a few dabs of pesto and a few slices of cooked bacon like prosciutto. You think the pesto would be in place of tomato sauce.

I get mine without the too bitter balsamic they use. I also like the sandwiches which are made on really fresh bread.   The only complaint I have about La Bocca is their almost always slow service, It usually takes at least 10 minutes to get any kind of drink order. Once, I sat at the bar for 20 minutes without being acknowledged by the underwhelmed staff at 2 in the afternoon.   Their drinks are nothing to rave about. The sangria is so so but it's also only 5 bucks a glass. The other signature drinks which come mostly as martinis are absurdly sweet.   Good place for lunch with a girlfriend but I feel the place is more gimmick than quality. Nonetheless, it is a fair option for those who don't want to drive to Postino for bruschetta.",

The atmosphere is great with various conventional tables, booth tables, coffee table and chairs/couches, and outdoor seating all available. It is low lit and has an old movie playing silently in the background.   The server was really friendly and helpful. While I was disappointed they didn't have a gluten free menu or at least gluten free options, he was more than willing to check out the meats, hummus, and other delicious options on the plates we ordered to see if those were were naturally gluten free.   They usually have some type of happy hour special, last night it was half off a bottle of wine which myself and three other friends enjoyed. We also ordered a bruschetta plank, the Mediterranean plate, antipasta plate, goat cheese and pear salad, and salami pesto pasta. My friends enjoyed the pasta and said it was great, I tried the toppings from the bruschetta and was able to eat anything from the two plates and the salad (- the bread of course) Everything was amazing. Its hard to say what we liked best because each item was so unique and flavorful.   The price was not bad for four people to go out and have wine and dinner. Our bill was around 80.00.   Overall, definitely a place you should try if you're in the area. Great lounge to just go and relax with friends.",

    "text": "Bday weekend in Scottsdale, has a recommendation from a local who said you must check this place out! Evening was beautiful we sat outside and there was live music inside! We ordered a pitcher of sangria to start and the calamari, which was perfect to taste! Our sever seemed not really interested in our table. She checked on us about every 30 min- several times flagging down the male server outside for drinks and to calm over our sever to place an order. Bruschetta was next- and we placed an order for 2 pizzas. As we sat there it just got later and later and I was starving with no sever insight! So my husband went to the hostess and cancelled our pizzas, no manager came over to check on us? The server lady nonchalantly said oh no worries I'll cancel your pizza and take care of the food tonight, no I'm sorry for your dissatisfaction. This place has great potential and wonderful food; I was sad I didn't get to try the pizza. Honestly this is what makes or breaks a business is the service- why hire ppl who don't give a damn.. just my thought!?",

I prefer Postino's foe bruschetta, but La Bocca is quite good as well. The salads were not as fresh as expected and pricey for the quality. Service was extremely slow considering the lack of a crowd.",

    "text": "I'd like to assume most 'dining active' people in the Tempe/Metro Phoenix area would know that just because La Bocca is on Mill Avenue does not mean it is like other establishments on Mill Avenue. For any tourists or visitors reading this, I say this because Mill Ave is associated with being rowdy and obnoxious, which is perfectly fine for the college scene. However, La Bocca is a refined wine bar with a customer base not like the ones seen on the stereotypical Mill Avenue.  The restaurant itself is very pretty. The main dining area is very comfy with high ceilings, candle lighting, and seating conducive for more intimate dining experiences. The street-side patio is great for people watching, but it's obviously louder during the night. You may also have a vagrant asking, \"Are you going to finish that?\" The patio couches around the corner are my favorite places to lounge, relax, eat fancy cheese, drink organic wine, and think about my first world problems.   I've only dined here a few times, and every time I've had the bruschetta accompanied by a bottle of wine or two. Light eating, but absolutely delicious!  What I think La Bocca needs to work on is their communication of specials. There are no table tents or chalkboards visible to the main dining room to let diners know that Sunday night is half off all bottles of wine. If you have specials on other nights then I don't know them after dining there a few times. Maybe the server says it in their spiel, but leaning on the side of overcommunication is not a bad thing,  All in all, La Bocca is a very cute restaurant. Yes I said cute. It's a nice date spot and the bruschetta is executed well.",

The bartendress, Bella, takes care of customers with a rare mix of knowledge, charm, and attention that will keep you coming back.    The food is consistently good to excellent, though it sometimes takes a little longer to come out when the place is packed.  Nonetheless, you are never left with an empty glass, and the comfortable appointments and relaxed atmosphere help to pass the time.    Sit at the bar.  Ask Bella for advice about what to drink.  Eat a pizza.  Tell me that does not sound like a nice evening out.",

We got a mushroom, veggie (forgot what it was called) it was awesome! Great spices and taste. Exactly what a pizza should be. The reason why I don't rate this place five stars is that I ordered two glasses of wine due to the fact that the quantity of wine was incredibly small for average. And we had the same glass of water from the moment we got there never got it refilled till we were practically done eating. I don't believe the waitress was lacking in her job, I think they were low staffed because most waiters were either taking orders or doing something else busy. Definitely want to come back but make sure not to order a 17 dollar glass of baby wine!",

After I paid, she tossed check on table and said \"thanks\" as she was turned around walking away. We looked at each other and and said \"wow, that was awkward\".   Antipasti - 5/5 Bruschetta Plate; You choose 4, we had Prosciutto, Salami, Mozz and Beets. These are all amazing and well worth the $12 for all 4.   Pizza - 2/5 We both had Margherita's , Crust was WAY over cooked to be Neapolitan, very crunchy and burned. The mozz was OK and sauce wasn't that bad, but couldn't get over the crunchy/burned bottom. (Other Yelpers said \"Mushy\" and thats the way it's supposed to be!)  My boyfriend and I are both servers and were blown away by how bad the service was! We were not expecting the world but that was BAD. Even on days I don't want to be at work I still don't treat guests like they are ruining my day, it's not good business.  All in all, the food was 50/50, you can find PHENOMENAL pizza elsewhere (Cibo, POMO, Gelato Spot). The service is what did it in for us though, I would never dine here again.     Cheers!  P.S. I had to get the servers name from the check. I will not throw her under the bus, if management cares, they can ask.",

Either way, I loved that it was quiet and I could actually hear myself think.  My friend and I split the goat cheese/pear salad & a margarita pizza. The pizza was about 10\" and was perfect to split with my friend. (If you ask the server to split the salad they charge $2 but if you split it yourself there's no charge)  I also ordered a glass of white sangria which was just fairly good.   The best part was the YELP check-in deal. It's a little confusing on your cell phone but it's after 3 check-ins they give you a free dessert. But the YELP coupon doesn't specify until after you click USE NOW. The cookie dessert was very decadent. It's basically a big half-baked cookie in a small cast iron topped with ice cream. For those who LOVE  cookie dough, this is the dessert for you. I enjoyed it but it was even more delicious because it was free. :)  Either way, our server (omg, i can't remember her name but she was FABULOUS!!) was super attentive, knowledgeable about the menu and had a good vibe all around.  Next time I'll try the bruschetta.",

However, from the time the waiter took our drink orders to the time we received the drinks was about 30 minutes. The restaurant was about 25% full.  Once we were able to order, everyone ordered an appetizer salad and an entree. One of us asked for anchovies on the Cesar salad. 4 of the 5 salads arrived around 8:45.. no anchovies. My salad never came out, and our waiter was nowhere to be found.   Once the food arrived, the anchovies were found on my co-workers pizza instead of the salad. I finally found the waiter, and I asked what happened to my salad and he sent over a manager. She told me she'd \"go ahead and take the salad off your bill\"... which I was like, \"thank you for not making me pay for a salad I never received\". Are you serious?!!?? Then she gave me a \"free\" piece of cake. I don't understand - I wanted a salad?  The rest of the food was ok, nothing spectacular. I had a pepperoni calzone. The decor of the place is very cool, and they have some great music. But if you want to have dinner in less than 2 hours and receive great service: I'd go elsewhere.",

Our waiter was so nice and seemed to understand my husband had an allergy but I think the kitchen recklessly used the wrong pasta (and of course, we had to pay an extra $3 for it) and failed to inform him or us.  I totally understand and appreciate that this is not a gluten free establishment. We have been to plenty of restaurants where there is cross contamination and my husbands stomach ends up bothering him, and he needs a few extra bathroom trips. This experience was NOT that. This was literally regular pasta served to a celiac.  My husband ordered a gluten free pasta with chicken and had the waiter note that it was an allergy. When it came out he said it was the most incredible GF pasta he's ever had and said it tasted just like regular pasta. (He's only been diagnosed 6 months so he still remembers what it tastes like). It was a red flag so we called the waiter over to ask before he ate anymore. The waiter said it was definitely gluten free so we asked for the brand saying it tastes amazing and we couldn't even tell at all. He went to the kitchen and returned saying they couldn't find the box. Another red flag but at that point he had eaten more than half of it.   About an hour later it hit him -- SEVERE stomach pain and up ALL night in the bathroom. The next day his stomach had doubled in size due to the inflammation from the allergy attack and it was literally HOT to the touch 24 hours later. I've never seen or felt anything like that, didn't even know a stomach could bloat so much, he looked pregnant. Since we cut out gluten immediately upon diagnosis it hadn't happened to him before. No we know. It took more than 48 hours to exit his system and he spent most of those hours between the bed and the bathroom. I felt horrible because I was the one who suggested we go to La Boca :(",

The food was disappointing in both quality and portion size, the wait was ridiculously long (the restaurant was not even busy at all), and the staff did not do anything to resolve these problems even though we were all clearly very upset with the service.

Run on sentences aside, I very much enjoyed this place. We got a bruschetta board and 2 pizzas and the 3 of us left very satisfied. The vibe wasn't stuffy and our waitress was very pleasant. One drawback, we were sat at one of the tables closest to the front door so it was sill fairly warm because of people constantly opening the door and allowing the hot air in. I just ended up drinking a lot of ice water to stay cool.   I'll most definitely be back, have to try a salad, the anti-pasti appetizer and all the other pizzas!",

    "text": "I've eaten at La Bocca on countless occasions and figured it was past time that I posted a review.  This restaurant is a fairly safe bet if you're looking for tasty food, relaxed atmosphere and a good selection of wine.  Some of what they do is terrific (especially the pizza), other things less so.  The service is always friendly but is inconsistent in terms of quality. On my most recent visit (two nights ago), my boyfriend and I split a salad and a pizza, plus a bottle of wine, which was half price (Monday night deal).  The bill totaled $42.00, which I consider very reasonable for what we got. Here's how our visit went: We were first seated at a very unfortunately located two-top, crammed next to the large serving board that dominates the dining space.  I probably would've overlooked that, but the table was also far too close to another one that was occupied.  I sat down and literally had no room to move without bumping into the diner behind me.  Since there was another two-top along the banquette seating, I asked our server if we could move.  Luckily for us, he said yes.  But I was still annoyed that the hostess put us there in the first place, since there were clearly better seating options available.  Strike one against the service.  My mood improved when I was reminded about the half-price wine that night.  I don't usually order an entire bottle when there's just two of us (yes, we could easily drink the entire thing, but one of us was going to need to drive afterwards), but when I calculated how much it would cost us for the two martinis we'd been considering, the half-price wine made more sense.  Our server suggested I might like two of the whites, and when I requested, he happily brought us a taste of each.  We went with a pretty good albarino, which normally runs $35 a bottle.  ($22-25 would be a more appropriate price, so if you're going to try this one, do so on a Sunday or Monday.)  Side note: the wine service was really odd and inconsistent. First, we'd clearly just tasted the wine, so pouring a taste and then offering it to my boyfriend was just ridiculous, not to mention insulting because I'm the one who knows about wine, AND I was the one buying dinner.  Seriously, these outdated, sexist rituals have to go. Also, I'm glad they provide a chiller, but it's weird for the server to recap the bottle after pouring the wine.  If there'd been a cork, he naturally wouldn't have even tried to.  It was also odd that the he stopped by once to refill my boyfriend's glass, but for the rest of the meal, it was up to me to refill our glasses. Strike two.  The salad I ordered was the \"harvest chop.\"  I have no idea why the kitchen decided that a sprinkling of tubetti pasta on top would add anything--it doesn't.  The little tubes add no flavor, color or texture, so...?  Nonetheless, it is a very tasty salad; the mustard vinaigrette is delicious (although the kitchen needs to be more careful about not overdressing the greens--ours were practically drowned).  Another thing about the salads: the menu says that the restaurant will happily \"split\" one for an extra 4 dollars.  I didn't intend to split mine and was worried when it arrived from the kitchen with two plates.  So I was relieved later to see no such charge on my bill, even though my boyfriend did wind tasting it, since they gave him a plate.  I'd barely begun my salad when someone from the kitchen arrived with our pizza.  This is what *should* have happened: he holds the pizza in the kitchen until we've finished the first course.  OR he gets to the table but then apologizes and offers to hold the pizza.  Instead, the young man just stood there looking at us, as if we were supposed  to clear a space on the table.  Seriously?  Strike three.  So my boyfriend moved the salad dish and his plate, while I said, \"We clearly are not ready to be served the next course yet.\"  Almost instantly, however, our main server rushed over to apologize and offered to hold the pizza until we're ready.  I replied, \"No point.  It's already on the table.\"  Now, you may think that I'm being a bit harsh, but the truth is, this was a major service mistake.  At PIzza Hut, I'd expect that kind of cluelessness.  Not at La Bocca.  After this, I paid very close attention to see how long it took for someone to clear the salad bowl once I'd emptied it.  The pizza, thank heavens, was outstanding.  We'd ordered the sicily (schreiner's sicilian sausage, sundried tomatoes, parmesan and goat cheese, shallots, xvoo, herbs).  I generally prefer my crust to be thin and crackley around the edges; this one was puffier and chewier, but I still loved it.  We passed on dessert, although we had a good laugh with our server over the silly and confusing \"banana fosters.\"    So we enjoyed our meal and won't hesitate to eat there again.  I'm just lowering my expectations regarding the service.  Sign of the times, alas.",

Decided to leave a review even though we had a good experience because seems like people tend to review when they have had a bad experience.    Went on Sunday at 7:00.  No wait even though they recommended a reservation.  Tables are very small and kinda packed but we scored by requesting two tables pushed together - much better!  Had a well made Martini and a nice bottle of wine, which was half price on Sunday!  Service was a little slow but we didn't care much as we wanted to visit.  Ordered the antipasti plate.  Somewhat vanilla but good and the the right amount for 4, and they weren't stingy on the bread like a lot of places.   Each couple split a salad (for a $4 fee) and a pizza.  We got the Harvest Chop salad and the Bocca Trio pizza; friends got the Goat Cheese and Pear salad and Margarita (sic) pizza - all good sized for a split.  The chopped salad was a little odd, with pasta, blue cheese, and vinaigrette but I'm not a salad person.  Out friends enjoyed the goat cheese and pear salad.  Pizzas were perfectly cooked, Neapolitan style, which we favor.  The bill ended up being under 50 bucks per couple.  Pretty good value for a night out.",

Service was on the slower side, and the food (pizza) is on the 3stars level at best, and overpriced for what they're charging. I've definitely had better pizza, but I guess this is pretty good for a college town. The chocolate chip cookie with ice cream was horrible, with the cookie not fully baked and had me wishing I was at BJ's instead.",

Can't say I've ever experienced a happy hour deal this spectacular.  Wonderful wine selection including delicious house made white and red sangria.  We spent a few hours at this cozy place with tons of natural light , beautiful wooden tables, great layout maximizing privacy with an elegant service station in the center to keep it from being too packed with tables.  The Margarita pie for 9$??  Seriously a steal.  The dough was moist, salty goodnes, perfectly wood fired with a delectable charred crust, San Marzano tomato sauce, house made mozzarella and fresh basil.  We wanted  to eat it all night long, sooooo good.  The bruscetta was good, we prefer the bread toasted and crisp, they serve it up cold and untoasted.  The prosciutto fig marscapone was delicious.  Five dollar glasses of quality malbec for an early dinner unheard of, we can't wait to go back!!!!! Such a relaxing vibe.",

We had the organgecello because they were out of the lemon. Man what a treat! The orange wasn't on the menu. We had an assortment of planks including on with smoked salmon, very good. We also had the mushroom pizza very good. I didn't taste the garlic pizza, I'm assuming it wasn't as good as the mushroom because it's the only thing that got boxed up. OK , three people, two pizzas, a plank and about 8 drinks for under $70 bucks. My next visit will be on a Sunday because of the specials. I will ask for the orangecello after I have warm Queen Creek olives with crusty bread (thanks for tip fellow yelpers) and a glass of wine. I think the ultimate question always is will I go back and the answers once more is yes! (on a Sunday)!   Oh yeah a great space, we sat inside in a area with a couch and low tables.. very cute and cozy.  Good eclectic mix of music,  love the huge painting over the bar.    Peace",

    "text": "When I walk down Mill Ave in Tempe I was always intrigued by the beautiful looking restaurant La Bocca. The tables spill out onto a small wrap around patio filled with beautiful looking people drinking their wine and eating delicious looking bruschetta! Needless to say I needed to give it a try. I have been there a few times now and have a very mixed feeling about the place. The atmosphere is great! Classy and elegant while still being relaxed. There are beautiful bench seating for larger parties and small intimate tables for the smaller groups. And the food... delicious! I'm kind of a bruschetta snob so it must be pretty good if I'm impressed by it! I think I've had a bite of each of their options but am partial to the pulled pork/pesto and the mozzarella, tomato, basil, and balsamic. All of them are filling, tasty, and beautiful looking! On my most recent trip we also tried the garlic pizza! Now I wouldn't recommend this pizza on a first date (especially if you're hoping to get a little kiss) but it was delicious! Delicious garlic, cheese, tomatoes, and herbs, but nothing was too overpowering. One of the things I love about this place is the dinner and a show option they have with ASU Gammage. Just show your ticket and you get a free glass of wine with a purchase of an entree. Also - once you check in 3 times a free cookie dessert! The part that I struggle with has been the service. Now I know I've only been there a few times but each time I've been a little disappointed. While the wait staff is friendly they always seem to be running all over the place and have a few too many tables.  And here is where I have to bring the rating down to where I did... A friend and I went to La Bocca last night before seeing a show at Gammage. I showed up about ten to 6 because I figured a rush of people would show up around 6:00 for a 7:30 show. I stood in line for a few minutes to put my name in for 2. A party of 4 behind me rushed up to the hostess and told her to put their name in at their spot in line. Once I got up to the hostess she informed me it would be a 10-15 minute wait. After 15 minutes neither my party nor the party in front of me had been seated but the party of 4 was seated because, as the hostess told a waiter - the man was driving her nuts so she just sat him. Finally just over 30 minutes later we were seated. We informed our waiter that we had a show to be at and need to leave by 7:15. So we ordered our wine and then placed our order, including our dessert (since we didn't want to be rushed...) Someone brought out our bruschetta which we enjoyed as always - and about 20 minutes later we got our pizza. When someone came to check on our pizza they then informed us that they'll put in our dessert. At about 7;10 we hadn't received our dessert and so I pulled a waiter over asking for our bill. When we hadn't received a bill by 7:15 we gave our card to another waitress and said we were in a hurry. When our bill was finally brought to us we had been charged for the wine and dessert (both which should have been free). So the staff had to void the previous transaction and bring us a new bill. So... we had to run off to our show and weren't ever able to enjoy our cookie dessert - sad face! Now that had been my worst experience there but I promise it's not usually that bad. Just thought I'd give you justification for my rating! Cheers!",

    "text": "I have been to La Bocca a few times now, but my most recent visit down to this Mill Ave pizzeria warranted a good review.   Buying \"groupons\" is something that Georgeann G's do best.  At the early stages of her groupon binge she scored a deal at LBUP+WB. We finally were able to put it to good use, choosing \"The Mouth\" as the location of our Saturday night.   We were greeted by a couple lovelies, and escorted to a little table in the back by the bar. The surroundings are warm and upbeat, with things that us gangsters refer to as \"wood-grain interior\" and \"killer beats\". I happened to notice that they have a movie projector, which in my case was running the ultra hip \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" with John Barrymore.   Our server promptly arrived to take drink orders and greet us. Dulea, I believe, was very helpful and had great suggestions (I tried to remember her name so she could get credit). We decided not to drink so we could enjoy as many dishes and flavors as possible for a good price. However, I am one who can chug some Arnold Palmer and our server kept them coming (servers tell me not to apologize, but around the fifth I think they regret it).  We started with the brushetta \"plank\" which offers four of many different combination of unique ingredients. Results were amazing, but my favorites were the salmon-caper and the tomato-pesto (the latter a suggestion). Our main course was a combination of two, splitting a pizza and sandwich. Now the pizza could be better, but I like greasy ass Domino's the best so I won't jump into that can of tomato paste. All the ingredients tasted very fresh, the outer crust was just WAY too big. The sandwich was great, especially with the suggestion of their house bread instead of the usual bread. Ending with a flight of artisan ice cream may have been the proverbial seal on the deal. I highly recommend trying these out. The mint chocolate chip unbelievably tastes exactly like chewing an actual mint leaf, instead of the usual neon green store bought treat.   It's easy to see why this urban pizzeria plus wine bar has survived the dwindling economy on Mill Ave.  I'm sure La Bocca will greatly help rebuild a strong market, setting a high bar for service and quality.",

I was dreaming about the amazingness of all the bruschetta options. My FAV probably the one with goat cheese and roasted garlic! After that maybe the goat cheese and honey then the smoked prosciutto!! The wine is also amazing all the workers there are totally down to earth and really want you to have a good time. My BF and I are pretty easy going customers and don't ask for too much and the workers really seemed to appreciate that especially having some difficult tables, it was nice to know our chillness was appreciated. Will always go to this place every time I visit!!!",

It was invite-only, so be very jealous! *I did not pay for anything other than drinks/tips, so keep that in mind. I got to taste some new and changed dishes from the menu to help them decide on new options for the general public (people like you, not me. Haha. I kill me!) One of the pasta dishes had green chiles and a white sauce. Anything with chiles in it is top in my book! It had just enough kick to make you know it was there, but not beg for more water or make haste to the bathroom. The service was friendly, and I could tell the \"normal\" patrons of the restaurant that night were quite happy with their experience. I have been there before, for a Yelp Elite event, but hadn't been back until last month. I WILL be back, even though it's on Mill, which is such an obnoxious place but you can't blame the business owners. Blame the college kids. Seriously. Be careful where you park! Mill Ave seems to change places that are free or that charge, so be on the lookout for free places on a side street.  The General Manger, Katie, was there and asking for suggestions. She even emailed me back within 24 hours. THAT is service. I wish everyone did that. Though, if they did, then places like this wouldn't stand out for their customer relations. Feel free to drop my name. No, don't. I mean, they should remember me, but you don't want to look pretentious by saying you know me, right?",

I guess I should talk about the food.  We shared a couple bruschetta plates and some vegetarian pizzas.  They were all tasty and I was happy with our meal.  The pizzas are on the small-ish side so I'd suggest ordering more than less.  For Mill Avenue, this is a premium spot for someone a bit older who is looking to get a few drinks and a decent quality meal.",

    "text": "Oh, La Bocca, you had me at hello.  Almost as soon as I sat down (it's seat yourself at lunch time) I was greeted by a friendly waitress with a refreshing glass of ice water. The water was delicious; it seemed like it was filtered and there was also a thick slice of cucumber floating on top that was crisp and fresh. That was some really great water and I very much appreciated it since it was 100+ degrees outside and I had walked there from my office on Rio Salado.  After some pondering, I decided to go with a garden pizza. The pizzas are personal size but they probably could be split by two people if you got a salad or appetizer to go along with it. I ended up eating the entire thing myself because it was so delicious! I loved every bite of it! The veggies tasted very fresh and they were allowed to shine since there was no tomato sauce... just some truffle oil and small amount of balsamic on the arugula. The blue cheese had a bite to it but there was just the right amount so that it didn't overpower. I do agree with some of the other reviewers that the center of the pizza was just a tad soggy, but I believe it was natural moisture from the roasted veggies. The pizza was not greasy at all. I thought the crust was the perfect balance of wood-fired crisp with a pleasant chewiness.  The service was great thru the whole meal and I really liked the decor and atmosphere. Overall, just a great first impression. I will definitely be back for lunch and hopefully happy hour so I can sample some of their wine list.",

    "text": "It's funny to think that some dough, a little bit of tomato sauce and a few scattered ingredients has our country obsessed with pizza. Estimates say that the pizza industry is worth somewhere around $30 billion dollars annually with over 60,000 pizzerias in the U.S. alone. Better get on that treadmill because each one of us apparently consumes around 23 pounds of pizza per year.  Who says were the chubbiest nation?  With those staggering numbers it's no surprise we have so many pizza joints vying for their piece of the pie. If you have any doubt, just go to famed Pizzeria Bianco on pretty much any night of the week they're open and expect a 2 hour wait minimum, obsession, oh yeah.   Over the past few years I've chowed down on slices from The Parlor in Phoenix, Liberty Market in Gilbert and now my latest favorite La Bocca Urban Pizzeria in Tempe. Situated along bustling Mill Avenue, like it's namesake, La Bocca exudes hip-urban-cool without being pretentious or douchey.   Outside LB there's a spacious patio that's perfect for sipping wine and watching the hunky college boys and girls saunter by. Inside the space is modern, dark and relaxed with low key music playing in the background and old foreign films projecting on the back wall. If you can, call ahead and reserve the orange banquette by the kitchen, probably the most comfortable seat in the house.   Bruschetta Planks ($12) come 4 in an order, but with so many outstanding choices it's hard to choose. Smoked prosciutto, fig, mascarpone cheese and truffle oil was balanced with salty and sweet, but left me wanting more. Pulled pork, housemade pesto and roasted red pepper was on the bland side, though the roasted garlic, goat cheese, arugula and balsamic popped with flavor and texture.  I'd also suggest the smoked sockeye salmon with capers and chef's tartar sauce, reminded me of a dinner version of lox and bagels.   Another great way to start might be with the Med Plate ($14). This is a huge plate filled with basil hummus, babaganoush, warm feta cheese, roasted peppers, queen creek olives, artisan toast, and house made flat bread. The consistency of the hummus was a little thick for my taste but still quite good paired with the creamy feta and salty olives.   I was actually surprised as to how good the pizza really is here. The first taste of the Bocca Trio ($13) revealed with high quality ingredients and charred chewy crust. Topped with crushed San Marzano tomatoes, pepperoni, salami, Schreiner's \"sicilian\" sausage,  mozzarella, fontina and olives LB's gas fired oven does an amazing job of caramelizing these toppings into a smoky and slightly sweet mouth parade.   There are 7 pizzas to choose from but if you don't see something that suits your fancy, build your own pizza ($8) or calzone ($9). At a $1-$3 each, toppings can add up really fast so select wisely from their 30 or so choices.   The only issue I have with La Bocca is that I didn't visit sooner.",

Great ambiance, good service, good wine list, decent food.  $14 starter plates are large, meant for splitting 3-5 people (cheese, Mediterranean, salumi plates available). We polished off the Mediterranean - hummus was fantastic,  as were olives. Flatbread was on the chewy side (microwaved?), and baba ghanoush was rather unauthentic, oddly watery.  $12 bruschetta is a steal (!) but vaguely reminiscent of Postino.  Would recommend visiting for the wine bar.",

The music was a little loud so unfortunately it was hard to carry a conversation.  I love that the menus offers to split the salad between two. It is the perfect size for a light dinner. The goat cheese and pear salad was fantastic!! I would absolutely return and have it again. It was full of flavor. The pear was the perfect texture and the goat cheese was nice and creamy. The dish was pleasing to the eyes and my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Although the food offered here comes from local sources, they don't offer organic options. As well, because pizza is the main dish on the menu, there is no gluten free options so I had to skip trying their brick oven pizzas which looked delicious. They had a nice wine selection and I appreciated the fact that they mentioned where the wine came from.  Not all wine is created equal, but the Pion noir I had there was refreshing and smooth. The service was great.the lady who took care of us was nice, attentive and friendly.",

    "text": "I liked dining at this restaurant. The food was good and the ambiance was nice. When I went into the restaurant, my group was seated near the back because we had a large party of people.   We ended up ordering a bruschetta plate, pizza, and the Mediterranean plate. We selected the smoked salmon bruschetta, smoked prosciutto bruschetta, and Brie cheese bruschetta.  I wasn't wowed by the pizza. The pizza tasted like a typical pizza to me. The Mediterranean plate had big chunks of flatbread as well as large slices of cucumber available for the basil hummus, roasted red bell pepper romesco, queen creek olive tapenade, and babaganoush dips. I thought the basil hummus and roasted red bell pepper romesco tasted fine. But, I didn't like the flavor of the babaganoush even though it is the typical flavor of eggplant dip, so I think others might like it. I also didn't like the queen creek olive tapenade because I don't like olives, but accidentally tried it without knowing what it was. The Mediterranean plate also had a rectangle of marinated feta that I thought was good.  I really liked the smoked salmon bruschetta the best. The salmon tasted great and the cucumber gave the bruschetta a light fresh flavor. It also had a lemon caper cream cheese with dill. The other two bruschettas were pretty good as well. The tomato jam bruschetta also had bacon bits, arugula, and and Brie cheese. The smoked prosciutto had a fig marscapone with truffle oil. I love marscapone.",

    "text": "Warning: as other reviewers have pointed out, the service can be extremely slow, but the pizza and breadsticks are very good! I think if some things had gone differently, this would have been a 4 or 5-star review.   Things got off to a great start because this restaurant was able to accommodate our big family including our dog on their patio without a reservation on a weekday night. Our server did warn us that the kitchen was running a little behind and that it would take a while to get our food (they didn't give us a time estimate). We weren't in a rush and so we ordered several items, including bruschetta, pizza, and pasta. Our server was also very accommodating and offered my father-in-law a taste of both iced teas on the menu to see which one he like better. The service was stellar up to this point! After we ordered, I went to use the restroom inside and saw that only a few tables in the restaurant were occupied and figured that we would get our food with only a minor delay. We got some olives and bread right away.  40 minutes went by and our food still hadn't come out. Our server came back to inform us that the food would be ready \"soon\". My two-year-old nephew is with us and was managing okay but was extremely hungry by this point. Only after these 40 minutes had elapsed did our server think to bring out some breadsticks for my nephew to chew on. Our food came out about 50 minutes after we ordered. Given that the restaurant was nearly empty I am not sure what could have resulted in this issue. I also observed that during this time, another table had sat down, ordered, and received their food all before our food had even come out. If the kitchen was truly behind, and if they were actually getting food out to other tables, they should have asked us if we wanted to receive our food as it was ready so that we would have something to chew on.  The service also took a bit of a dive throughout the evening. My father-in-law did not get a refill on his iced tea until about five minutes before we left the restaurant, close to an hour and a half after we sat down. I also found it strange that in a family setting, our server on two or three occasions talked about drinking and getting drunk, both with regards to the people at the table and about himself referencing what he was going to be doing later in the evening. Between the nine of us, we ordered exactly one alcoholic beverage, so I found this line of discussion very odd. In the end, he was nice enough to offer us coupons towards a future visit and he gave us some of our items for no charge, but in some sense, especially since we were visitors to the area, this was too little too late.  As for the food, the pizza crust was baked to perfection and the sauce had a very tomato forward flavor. The calzone was also delicious and not too heavy ! My brother-in-law said that the pasta was just okay, but others in the party enjoyed the bruschetta and salads they ordered.  If I were reviewing on the food alone, this restaurant would have earned a much higher rating. I get that restaurants can have unforeseen circumstances, but given our experience and other reviews it seems like this is a more systemic issue and that things could have been handled a lot better given how empty the restaurant was. Until the restaurant gets better at service on both good and bad days, I would hesitate to return or recommend that others visit.",

That was a big red flag to me and I realized why later on in the night...  The inside decor is cute and they were playing movies on the big screen throughout the night. They also have a pretty big bar area. Our party of 6 got a good sized table to fit all of us with enough elbow room and didn't feel cramped.  I went with the chicken pesto pizza, but didn't feel like pesto sauce that night and they were able to let me substitute for marinara sauce. Loved the toppings on this pizza especially the truffle oil! Pizza was a decent size probably about the same size as you would get at build your own pizza places like Pieology or Blaze Pizza. The dough and crust itself though was better than I expected! Perfect texture with the crunch outside, but nice chewy inside. The negative thing about this pizza is that they seemed skimpy with the toppings. Looked like only half of my pizza had chicken.  Everyone else enjoyed their food, but I docked 2 stars because THEY WERE SO SLOW!! Did they only have one chef in the kitchen that night or something!? We literally waited over 45 minutes for our food. The food seemed fresh, but geez I have never waited that long just for pizza. It wasn't even a busy night because it was just our table and 3 other tables occupying the restaurant that night. Overall, food is decently priced for a place in downtown and they have a really good happy hour, but service is slow!",

We made a reservation to have dinner here before going to Cinderella at Gammage Theatre. The hostess promptly seated us at our table that was ready and waiting for us.   Our server was great - she was very attentive and friendly. She even inquired if we were on our way to Gammage to recommend when best to put in our entree orders because a few other parties were also going to the play.   The charcuterie board was yummy, lots of meats, good bread and an odd jam that none of us liked the flavor.   My mother and I split a bruschetta board, you can pick four and they cut them in half (not quartered like other places I've been). We also split he goat cheese salad which was very yummy.

I did not have one arrangement that was not amazing on the lips!

That was a bit crazy...and now that I remember, I have to remove one star from the rating just because of that policy..silly!  Let me say that the ambience is nice and trendy and just cheesey enough to be okay...I mean do you really need a fake digital fireplace reflected on your wall?  No really? Do you?

Wine by the glass, draft beer and well liquor (listed in the drink menu) is all half off, as are Bud Light and Coors Light bottles. The bar is nice and service is friendly and attentive. As a dinner option, however, I think you can do better. I am not super impressed with the food I have tried at La Bocca...the caesar salad was just OK and I've had better caprese sandwiches other places (note: the caprese sandwich is no longer on the menu...there is a caprese salad though).   Three stars as a dinner option and four stars as a happy hour destination, giving La Bocca 3. 5 stars. However, I'll round up to four because I value places with good happy hour specials; plus La Bocca is a nice addition to Mill Avenue and a good place to escape when you want a more grown up night out on Mill.",

    "text": "Three weeks ago, I started a review that I haven't gotten to the bottom of yet:)    We were at the Yelp event,failing to pry anything free from the pizza vultures,and decided to just go ahead and order anyway.  I.E.,this is a payed for the food review for the most part.   Even though this was a really busy,loud night,our orders came out quickly ,correct and were really tasty.Luckily we caught a free bruschetta plate while ordering so we managed to try all of them by the end of the night by buying those we'd missed.   Ordered x 2 personal pizza and the chocolate ice cream dessert.The pizzas are way better on the top than what which supports them but  that's not to say the dough is bad it's just not matching the promise of that which sits above it.. Dessert was the OMG for two a chocolate espresso brownie with vanilla  ice cream. Nowhere near as dense as it sounds or as sickly as it could be.Really well done.  Maybe not a fair assessment to make on just one night but I've not been back yet to see how much variation between pizzas there are.Prices fairly reflect the location,interior and the quality of the ingredients being used.   I'd go back if in the region, I'd meet people there as a kick off point but I can't say I'd drive from the W Valley just to eat here. ( Isn't that True of Mill Ave in general though?) .  3.75 rounded to 4. ( edited for grammar , no other changes)",

    "text": "La Bocca Urban Pizzeria and Wine Bar is a place my friends and I frequent often. Great service, and sangria to die for! I prefer the red over the white, the flavor is incredible and you can taste all of the different fruits in it. Not to mention its a gorgeous burgandy color and it has fresh oranges in it - beautiful combo!  My favorite bruschetta is the fig, mascarpone, smoked prosciutto and truffle oil. The crunchiness of the bread mixed with the salty flavor of the prosciutto combined with the sweet taste of fig and creaminess of the mascarpone creates an amazing melt in your mouth combination. Sometimes we order an entire plank (which is 8 pieces) of just that bruschetta. I also really enjoy the roasted garlic and goat cheese with arugula and balsamic. We have  tried the pulled pork, house made pesto and red pepper, both of those were good as well.   The last time we went my mom wanted to try the goat cheese and pear salad. The mix of the candied walnuts, cranberries, tomatoes, and balsamic vinegar added with the creaminess of goat cheese and sweetness of the pear was a combination that leave your mouth not only wanting more, but ordering another one.   My favorite pizza at La Bocca (which I strongly recommend) is the truffle mushroom, but make sure you like spinach before you decide to order this pizza! It comes with a lot of fresh spinach on top and on certain days of the week you get a 2 for 1 pizza! It is a must try!   Visit La Bocca on Mill if you have the chance - it is GREAT for groups - it is where my girlfriends go all the time but its much easier for everyone if you make a reservation ahead of time and if you want to split checks be sure to tell your waiter/waitress as soon as you sit down! I also love to go there on dates! It can be a fun, cozy, romantic place to go! All around YOU MUST TRY LA BOCCA!",

    "text": "So I've been here a few times, all with mixed results.  Place always seems to be fairly busy, and I must say the food has been fantastic on all occasions. We arrived on a Wednesday night around 8ish and only had to wait a few minutes for the hostess to clear a table.  As other reviewers have mentioned seating ranges from great to fair, the main dining area is a bit loud and somewhat cramped with only a few feet between tables. Not an overall detraction though, especially if you like to listen to your fellow diners' conversations.   We had some drinks and ordered the antipasti plate (which I'm pretty sure we've had before, more on that in a moment) which consists of some crusty bread, tasty salami, some prosciutto-wrapped cheesy bits, some cheese, mustard and pesto.  Not bad for ~14 bucks, very comparable to Postino's or any other tapas/wine bar fare.  Unfortunately, this is where our visit took a turn for the worse...  I love me some pesto, so much so I had also ordered a calzone with it, even before the antipasti plate arrived.  Glad it did shortly thereafter, as it turns out they use walnuts in their pesto instead of traditional pine nuts.  Now, I'm a foody, and I'm all about innovation with traditional recipes. That being said, when you put a potential allergen in a common food like this, YOU NEED TO MENTION IT!  As you may have guessed, I'm highly allergic to walnuts (but not any 'good' nuts at least, including pine nuts), and nowhere on the menu was this mentioned at all.  Probably because this was done less as a food innovation and more as a cost-saving feature, as pine nuts are 3-5 times as pricey as walnuts... And I'm 99% positive I had pesto here on a previous occasion with no issue, so I think this may be a recent change.  Luckily I caught the tell-tale signs early so didn't convulse in a heap on their wood-paneled floor, but needless to say this certainly ruined our night.  Our server was very kind, however the manager was a bit of an ass, and actually said 'All pestos have some kind of nuts in them'.  Yeah, pine nuts.    He did end up comping the antipasti (albeit grudgingly), frankly I'd be happier to have paid for it with the promise they would just point that out somewhere on the menu.  I know its ultimately my responsibility to be aware of what I'm eating considering my condition, that being said its the establishment's responsibility to provide information so I can make an informed decision.    In closing, normally I'd rate this a 4 star place, but due to the pomp of the manager and the fact they nearly killed me due to the lack of a simple sentence on the menu I have to subtract a couple.  Unfortunately I will probably not return, but I do recommend any readers to go and enjoy the above-average grub.  Just be sure to ask if you have any food allergies!",

    "text": "I'm stopping by for another lunch at La Bocca Urban Pizzeria, and I have to reflect upon why this is one of my favorite Arizona restaurants.  We discovered La Bocca several years back (along with some of our grad student friends), and have been hooked ever since.  The cuisine (and in particular the pizza!) has been consistently great, with matching service.  The new items that have been added to the menu over the last couple years have been interesting and have added variety.  Regular specials keep us stopping by throughout the week.  The nicest element, though, was to see La Bocca reach a point over the last year of comfortable, stable popularity, and to see the character of the restaurant change.  Instead of scrapping with the other restaurants on Mill to grab every customer they can, they focused instead on building relationships with their existing customer base.  I find it refreshing to find a restaurant where they really care about making your experience great, not for the tip but because they want you to be a regular.  The waitstaff makes a real effort to get to know the customers...feels nice not to be \"table 12\".  The food is dynamite, as it has been -- I always struggle between the Porco and the Bocca Trio pizzas, while my wife can never decide between the Truffled Mushroom and the Garden Veggie.  The pizza crust is wonderful and crackly, the toppings fresh and delicious, and the flavor combinations in their signature pizzas unique and exciting.  The menu is short enough to not be overwhelming, but has an enormous range to offer, and the drinks selection is similarly impressive (try the red sangria!).  The bruschettas are just as awesome as the pizzas, and the salads are nuts!!  During the pleasant months, I love the patio -- even has heaters, and there is no better post to watch the Saturday night wildlife on Mill.  As I am writing this, I have once again seen the service that makes me love this place.  The waitress, after very friendly greetings and taking my order, has seen me working and stepped back, keeping my drink perfectly full and quietly checking with me whenever I take a break.  If you are in a talkative mood, they will all but sit down and chat.  Happy to have such an awesome spot within walking distance!",

Unlike some other restaurants on Mill Ave.  Went on a Thursday night, service was inattentive and sloppy.  The pasta my date and I ordered was far worse than you would get from a Bertolli's frozen entree.  The waiter did notice that I didn't eat any and inquired as to the problem, wondering if it was \"too spicy.\"  Not at all!!  Very, very bland and we didn't even have salt or pepper on the table.  Also, the crowd, at least on our night, was middle-aged wine snobs and loud college kids.  Kind of a weird vibe in this place.....  They did remove the charge for one of our dinners from the bill. It took FOREVER to get the server to bring the bill and complete our transaction so we could leave....  Also, I had a caprese salad that was delicious and perfectly seasoned, however three tomato slices and 6 slivers of mozzarella (delicious as it was) isn't what I was expecting....  I will not be back.  Too many great places nearby.  Live and learn...",

That is a big compliment.  They have a great wine list, good food and a really cool loungy atmosphere. It's great for large groups (we had 10+ for lunch) and for group get togethers (we had 10+ reunion at happy hour).",

We always go to our few favorites and I wanted an excuse to Yelp!  We went to Mill Ave and settled on La Bocca.  First off I love the name, since it's almost like my last name!    We sat outside until we were too cold and instead took a table in the window inside so we could still people watch.  We ordered two pizzas:  The Margherita and some crazy named pizza with bechamel sauce, bacon and grilled onions.  Both were really good.  I only like bacon sometimes and wasn't in a bacon mood that day so I polished off the Margherita while Gary ate the crazy named bacon pizza.    The restaurant is super cute inside too.  You know, I think I had some drinks there on Halloween Night....   It's pretty close to our house so I'm sure we'll be going back there again sometime soon.  I'm always in the mood for pizza!",

This place is STYLISH - whether it's the plush lounge chairs on the patio, or the old school movies being projected on the walls - there's definitely an element of class that is rare for the Mill Avenue district.  First impressions were extremely positive - the place was busy but not packed, candlelit tables, and dim lighting provides the perfect atmosphere for a date, but not too much so that it causes that uncomfortable, formal, anxiety feeling.  La Bocca almost seems like an AZ88 in Tempe for those who are fans.    I was pleasantly surprised at the prices on the menu.  Most items were in the $10-15 range, and I was immediately intrigued by the various pizza selections.  I focused my sights on the garden pizza, which took me by surprise because it was basically a chef-tossed salad on a really good pizza crust.  My girlfriend went with the bruschetta planks and chose two homemade pesto, one mozarella basil, and one roasted artichoke - DELICIOUS!  Top that off with a few glasses of really good sangria and you've got a really good meal for right around the $40-50 mark.  Needless to say we will be returning!",

I would recommend you get a table outside(I hate dining outside on the east coast). There is a great energy and lots of great things to look at on Mill.

I am weaksauce though and opted for just a glass of reisling because my ass would've been way too drunk had I thought I could drink a whole bottle.  The server recommended the reisling and mMMMmmMM I'm glad he did! It was like sweet, cold, grape juice! Barely alcohol tasting - just the way I likey my alkie :)  Anyway, the gang and I had the goat cheese and pear salad and the mushroom truffle pizza.   The salad was better than I expected. With just the perfect amount of walnuts and pear and cheese. The only bad thing is the dressing was a bit more tart than I preferred.  The pizza was de-LISH! You could really taste the truffle oil and the cheese and the mushrooms... mmmm... please excuse my drool.",

    "text": "This is one of the best pizzerias I've been to in the US.  Located right on Mill St. a few blocks away from ASU's main campus, you feel a certain presence when approaching La Bocca Urban Pizzeria and Wine Bar. No longer are you to expect a mom-and-pop brick oven eatery when you come to Bocca. The ambiance is reminiscent of a fine dining restaurant that Yelp would rate $$$. The food is stellar. The menu is a tad too large for a restaurant that is marketing itself at this caliber, but it's logical in design. The wait staff was solid -- not amazing, but definitely earned their tip with a smile that night.  I ordered the Med(iterranean) Plate, a Bruschetta Plank (forgot which 4 we ordered), and a Truffled Mushroom Pizza. The Med Plate was great--a platter of flatbread, thick slices of French bread, hummus, olives, feta cheese, and baba ganoush. The baba ganoush was extremely garlic-y, which is always welcome on my palette. The olives were plentiful and flavorful. The feta cheese was a bit lacking in sustenance, but was a good sampler. The French bread and flatbreads were both toasted and garnished nicely. The hummus was a bit on the thicker side (not as well-blended/liquified as some other places), but was rich and pleasant atop the two breads.  The Bruschetta planks were a bit expensive, but they were awfully tasty. Once again, I forgot which four we ordered, but my favorite had to be the Pulled Pork one.  The pizza that they give you is fairly large, especially for the price. For $9-$14, you get a personal thick-crust 8\" (give or take) pizza that is hard to down in one sitting. I added some melted ricotta cheese on my pizza (a fair amount of it, actually) for only $1 more. All in all, I feel that any of the pizzas there deserve ordering, since the rest of my party had trouble finishing their's, even when they were gorging their mouths with it.  This pizzeria also has 4 Peaks' Kiltlifter on draft, so that's another high plus. The beers and most of the wines are very reasonably-priced, so ask your server about what they recommend when pairing your order to your alcohol.  Would definitely come back to this place when I'm back in town.",

    "text": "Me and three girlfriends headed to La Bocca for Happy Hour after reading all the wonderful Yelp reviews. I was really excited on my way there, but left feeling underwhelemd.   For me, it felt a little big, commercial, the decor was kinda cheesy - think red leather chairs, Pier1 Important wall sconces, even a \"VIP\" looking lounge in red velour. Hardly, original or intimiate enough to be considered an authentic \"wine bar\" in my opinion. If you're a regular at chain restaurants you'll probably think this is a cute place (call me a snob, whatever). Let's talk about the wine list at this \"wine bar\" --- it was okay but they were out of our first two choices of red - not ideal for a wine bar. Then, we ordered our bruchetta for our table of four and were annoyed when it came out cut in halves. Knowing we were sharing the plate, maybe the waitress should have clued us in? We ended up ordering a second board for the table so we could each try the variety. I do have to say, the bruchetta was good.   We were clearly there for happy hour on a Wednesday night (which I do love goes until 6:30pm) but found it a little rude that the waitress came by six minutes after the mark to ask if we wanted a second round. There was no grace period so we paid full price. We did notice, that our full price glasses of wine were filled to the brim - so maybe 1/2 price = have the wine?   Don't get me wrong... the place is cute enough, would def seem like a \"fancy date night place\" if I were still in college. I'd go again with girlfriends but won't be racing back with my husband.   I wish we would have tried more food because that seems to be the key to this place. Ambiance and service are good - not great. Oh, and the music could use some updating. The playlist was... eh... interesting   Maybe it's my love of Postino or maybe its because I was on Mill Avenue I was instantly judging the place.",

Last night, Boyfriend and I ordered two garden pizzas. I think that's my favorite! We've also had their garlic pizza (I probably wouldn't get that one again, but it's the only thing I've been disappointed in on their menu), the truffled mushroom pizza (awesome!), and I LOVE their goat cheese & pear salad.  Boyfriend has also enjoyed the Sicily pizza before.   Two big thumbs up from me. I've been here with friends, with classmates, on dates, and before events at Gammage. I have always left pleased with the experience. Give La Bocca a try! You won't be disappointed.",

But honestly I think it's the atmosphere that makes this place work so well. It's never too loud, always simultaneously classy and laid back. So no matter your purpose, you can fit in.

    "text": "My husband and I go to La Bocca often -- I think that it is safe to say that it is our most favorite dinner-out location.  I can't remember how exactly we stumbled upon this wonderful restaurant, but it holds a special place in our hearts because it is where we went for dinner after we got engaged.    We usually prefer to sit outside since the inside dining area tends to be rather noisy, but there are always heaters on so it is comfortable, even in the winter months.  The bruschetta is, by far, our favorite part of the meal -- make sure that you try the mascarpone, fig, and prosciutto variety, as well as the roasted garlic, arugula, and balsamic choice.  Both are absolutely to-die-for!  For our entree, we always split a pizza (we choose the build-your-own option) and what we have on it usually varies.  For dessert, if we're feeling like a splurge, we enjoy the warm chocolate chip cookie with melty, delicious vanilla ice cream on top.  It is completely decadent and luxurious, the type of dessert that you seem to get lost in.  (The cookie takes about 15 minutes to arrive to the table, but it is DEFINITELY worth the wait.)  Although we have the same foods every time we go there, the food is THAT awesome that we don't feel like we are stuck in a rut -- we love going there because, with the foods we order, we always receive sheer perfection.  La Bocca is a must!",

Waitress had suggestions and I went with the truffle laced mushroom pizza with fresh basil. I also ordered a bruscetta (garlic) and both were fantastic.   The beer/wine selection was great too, though I just had a soda.   The only two odd things:  1. No uniforms for the wait staff, and was a bit difficult to pick out the waitress if you needed one.  2. The soda. It came in a can. And they charged for each can (first $1.50, and $0.75 for each additional). Maybe they don't have a fountain drink stand, but that's kind of weird.",

    "text": "I had one of the most awkward dining experiences of my life last night at La Bocca. We went there for my husband's friend's birthday. All 5 of us swore we heard the waitress bring up the fact that it was his birthday and say that he got to choose a free dessert (it's not like it's an uncommon practice at restaurants). He told her what dessert he'd like, and we sat there for an hour just talking and hanging out. Finally, we flagged down some guy who looked like a manager and asked about it because it had been so long. It seemed like they just forgot and were going to go get the dessert. Less than 2 minutes later, the waitress came back and had this conversation with our friend that made me feel so awkward and embarrassed I couldn't even look at her. She's said something like, \"Oh, I didn't hear you say you wanted something and you guys already paid. Do you still want something?\" Our friend brought up the fact that all of us were under the impression that he got a free dessert for his birthday. She basically just said no, apologized for the miscommunication, and walked away after our friend said to nevermind. I was shocked. We'd been sitting there an HOUR under the wrong impression and they knew that. If they had good customer service, they would've just given us the dessert that probably only cost them $1 and apologized, but they didn't, and the whole dining experience ended on a sour note. I hope it was worth the small amount of money they saved. I don't care how good the pizza was, I will never go back now because it was so awkward and mismanaged. The food is overpriced for what it is, and they certainly don't justify the price tag with service.",

They have 8 different options and you can choose 4 with each order. I normally get  the smoked prosciutto & fig, pulled pork & pesto, roasted garlic & goat cheese, and the pesto with roma tomato.  Yum. Yum. Yum.  I've had a few of the pizzas and loved them. My new favorite is the goat cheese & pear salad. Honestly I have never tried anything I wasn't completely satisfied with.  They offer a nice drink selection and have different specials most days of the week. The atmosphere is sophisticated and relaxed.  If you haven't been to La Bocca, please go. Right now.",

TO TRY: the bruschetta (i always get the pesto, roasted garlic, roasted artichoke and lastly the mozzarella, basil, etc), caprese salad is VERY good and i've tried the white chocolate macadamia cookie with ice cream on top! it was great!  NOT SO GOOD: i found the Mediterranean plate slightly disappointing, as I LOVE hummus and the taste of their hummus fell short and was rather salty for me. they're caesar salad was not one of my favorites either.  other than that, the atmosphere is great and i try to take at least a monthly trip to la bocca for my beloved bruschetta!  P.S. my most recent visit to La Bocca and a check-in on Yelp earned me a free cookie with ice cream on top :O)",

I tried a few of their appetizers with a couple of glasses of sangria and liked it all. I'd definitely come here if I lived closer.

I haven't tried much but bruchetta here but haven't really been disappointed either. Even the ones that \"haven't been a fan of\" of the ones i tried when i have mixed and matched when getting to select I still would order over bruchetta at most places as they are still very good. Did try a pizza once and wasn't amazed but nothing stood out (it's been awhile since that). The bruchetta however comes to mind every time i hear the word.  Oh and the service is very friendly and attentive. One night I was in and they had just finished a major catering event and it had said on the front door that the kitchen was going to be slow until about the time we arrived. Yet when we ordered and it took a bit to get the food (barely a delay in my book and if I hadn't been apologized to by the waiter probably wouldn't have know it was longer than normal) we got a nice little discount.",

A couple of my favorites are the smoked prosciutto, marscapone & fig and the roasted artichoke, sauteed spinach & red pepper.  Wine is reasonably priced (and discounted for happy hour), and the salads are tasty.  The balsamic drizzle on the caprese salad was thick and sweet - much higher quality than you'd find at most restaurants.  Outdoor seating is a great option when it's not too hot out, and service has always been prompt and courteous.  Overall, a good option when you are looking for a step up in quality from most of the other restaurants on Mill.",

It's one of those places I crave when I'm hungry!! Whenever we go, we get the bruschetta to start and then a pizza each (which may seem too much but I would feel so bad afterwards if i didn't finish mine, which barely happens). The food is just amazing. On top of that, the service is excellent. One time they were a little late with our food, the manager visited our table to apologize and gave us our pizzas for free. Talk about good customer service! Other than that time, the service is actually pretty fast and the waitresses we get are suppper nice! Overall, it's one of my favourite restaurants that I will continue to look forward to whenever I plan a trip to Tempe.",

He told us the kitchen was SUPER busy...despite the fact that the restaurant was barely half full. Anyways, I came back with Kim and friends for her birthday this past weekend, and I am SO glad I did! Here goes:  Atmosphere: We all know Mill Ave can get a little wild, and quite a mish mosh of folks on saturday night. So, that being said when I walked into La Bocca I felt that the environment was very cool and sophisticated, while still being young.   Drinks: $5 sangria and a pitcher for $18? Sign me up. Everyone at the table drank sangria save for one couple that ordered Bells....which is a delicious beer out of K-zoo Michigan :). Anyhow, everyone enjoyed the rojo sangria.   Food: Hello deliciousness! I had the chopped salad and a truffle mushroom pizza. I ate the entire salad which had little tubetti pastas, bacon, blue cheese crumbles and a phenominal dijon vinagrette. The pizza....dear diary I am in love with this pizza. Mozzarella, goat cheese, mushrooms, truffle oil, tomato, fresh spinach....literally slices of heaven in my mouth. I ate all but two slices. Thats way more than anyone my size should ever eat. Must do that again.   The server: he was cool and seemed to have no problem handling the whole table of us. He even brought Kim carmel ice cream with a candle. A trick candle at that. Kudos my man.   Overall, we had a great time at La Bocca, and despite the strange experience the first time around i'll definately be returning.",

Not only are the bruschetta planks fantastic (MUCH better in my opinion than a popular, more snooty wine cafe restaurant praised in Phoenix.) The prosciutto and truffle oil plank is my favorite, and the use of heirloom tomato's whenever they are in season is a very nice, and tasty touch. Drinks are excellent and fresh, and the staff has always been friendly.     My favorite part though, is the cozy, unpretentious atmosphere. From college students to working professionals, you really won't feel out of place whether you're in casual-wear or gussied up for a date.     If you are coming here expecting to be surrounded by the plastic of Scottsdale and the attitude to match, you will probably be dissapointed. But, if you are looking for a cozy relaxing place to enjoy a meal, or go on a date, this is a perfect spot.",

This place intrigued me since the begining and had pretty good reviews. So we decided to go there for my B-day dinner (round 1). My husband made reservations and told them it was my b-day. We were seated right away. The menu looked good and the food was also really good...so why so few stars??  My husband aparently got up during dinner to make sure the waitress new about the special occasion and she told him they don't do anything. While that is def their decision I must say a dessert with a candle goes a long way for not much dough on the restuarants part. Not to mention the waitress Laren...who hardly ever remebered that she was our waitress never even wished me a happy b-day. All in all the service sucked which was a major factor in our mutual decision to never come back. She messed up our bill and was almost rude several times. The worst part was it was ridiculously hot the whole time.  Save your money there are plenty of places to choose from...infact Cafe Boa accoss the way is 10 times better",

First of all, I called to make sure we would be able to eat and get to the show in time, without rushing, and the hostess assured me that we would be fine. I put our names in for \"call-ahead\" (not reservations) and we drove on down. She even directed me where to park and to bring my ticket up for validation. We had the best server, and I am embarrassed to admit I forgot to get her name for this review. She kept our water glasses full, made sure our order was put in right away so we wouldn't have to hurry to get to Gammage, took care of the check right away, and made good recommendations. I ordered the Chicken Pesto Pizza which was perfect. It was a large enough meal for me (I even shared with others at my table!), but it doesn't come with a salad like the pasta dishes do. The rest of my party had pasta--one bolognese and the other two had the Alfredo. The person who ordered the bolognese wished there was more sauce on the pasta, but loved the flavor. The orange was very evident, not unpleasant, in the Alfredo dish. Both of the pastas were not huge portions, but they did have salad (house or Caesar) and bread included. All of us agreed that we want to return and only order pizza--I know I'm going to try the Truffle Mushroom!",

It's great to take a date or your parents, a buddy of yours, to celebrate someone's birthday at the tables outside or for a business meeting with a group of colleagues.  One time I went there for a business meeting.  My boss told me to go.  I don't know why.  I showed up and I didn't know anyone there and they were all talking about biotechnology and, while a cool subject, not the field of work I'm in at all.  And everyone there was baby-faced and young.  I knew the guy speaking, but that's about it.  It was happy hour and I got drunk as fuck and ate free pizza.  So, if you were there, I was the guy wearing a tie that nodded approvingly during the lecture and slurped down like three cocktails and three beers.  Altogether, I've probably been to La Bocca either five or six times and I'm always, always pleased with the service and the food.  Even when it's crowded, and I have seen it pretty packed a couple times, someone's going to be there to ask you if you need another drink or more water or anything.  I've tried a lot of their different pizzas.  I've had the badboy with the truffle oil and spinach, the Sicily, whichever one it is that's got like cheese and basil on it.  I'm pretty well-versed in what these guys offer for their standard pizzas and each one is pretty awesome.  Their appetizers kick ass too.  Love the cheese platter.  The Mediterranean platter slaps me in the face with its deliciousness.  For some reason lately, lots of restaurants I've been eating at, I've been ordered their sangria.  As of now, La Bocca ranks up pretty highly.  That fucker was delicious.  Fruity and sweet, but not too sweet.  It was great.  This place is pretty rad.  If you want to class it up without spending too much money (single pizzas are as cheap as $8), this is definitely the place.",

Their pizza is the perfect thin crust, with HUGE air bubbles around the outside edge and almost charred on the bottom. Sheer perfection. No soggy deep dish for this gal! The pizzas on their menu are unique and delicious, and they have a great selection of toppings if you want to create your own. My very favorite is the Porco pizza - pulled pork and serrano chiles! YUM. And the bruschetta...let's not even go there. I could eat the proscuitto, mascarpone, and fig bruschetta for every meal of the day. You get to pick four pieces and I would consider ordering all four of that one (heh). Although, the pulled pork&roasted red pepper and caprese (fresh mozz, basil, tomato, and balsamic) deserve a mention too. Everything tastes so fresh and so wonderful.  The ambiance is great there, especially if it's a little busy inside. They have this gorgeous painting of a lady above the bar, and it looks like she's watching over you with a solemn and beautiful eyes while you stuff your face with bruschetta and sangria. The lighting is semi-dim and every table gets a candle. This place would be awesome for a date or a night out with the girlfriends.   As far as the service, I've never had bad service there. I honestly appreciate that their servers are not too nosy and don't check up on you every two seconds - I want to enjoy my meal and any good server should be able to tell if you need something (like a refill) without having to bother you. And they never do. Which is a plus in my book. However, if you happen to be one of those extra-needy/picky customers who want something every two minutes (you know who you are), maybe this place is not for you.   Last but not least...the price is right. Not too expensive, and I feel that the quality of food provided is excellent and consistent. Normally when I go with another person, our bill is always under $40.   If you've never been - check it out!",

    "text": "After having read several other reviews of La Bocca, I debated on writing one at all. So many of the existing comments accurately describe it, that I wasn't sure I'd have anything left to contribute. It's training wheels for a real wine bar - the wine selection is slim pickin's without much excitement. The bruschetta lacks creativity which is disguised by the fact that you \"get to choose\" 4 options. The pizza's is mediocre (albeit very good crust) but  decently sized. Realistically, I don't know what I expected from yet another restaurant striving to stand out despite its cliche concept.  The reason I write this is because the food doesn't suck and it's worth it to go on Tuesdays during happy hour. Half off wine, beer and most liquors AND it's buy one pizza get one free. It's a great deal and the price more so matches the quality of food. It is a good deviation from chains and not quite as expensive as a quality independent wine bar. Perfect for an early glass of wine on a Tuesday.",

    "text": "Hmmm, \"I've experienced better\" does actually sum up my meal but I am loath to leave it at that. ...I must go on!   La Bocca is certainly easy on the eyes. A little spot on Mill with a low neon sign, lovely soft lighting, a stunning bar with an enormous reproduction old dutch master painting of a supple young noblewoman looking over the bar crowd. Hip urban art on the walls of the dining room, people's faces lit in low candle lights from the table. Truly what is not to like?...I want to join this lovely party.    I do, with a group of friends on a Friday. It is early and La Bocca is busy but not bustling, their patio is open and the dining room still has some empty tables. I look in at this inviting time and think, this will definitely work. A glass of wine, maybe a pizza, some bruschetta, I could get used to this wine bar so close to home. Ahh, and so soon my bubble was to burst.  First, the hostess. Seems a little taken aback by the idea of seating us...a table....for 4....now? K. Turns and looks out on to the numerous empty tables...um, running thru the options, a table...for 4.... We wait, people line up behind us, we continue to wait. Initiative seizes us and   we start moving towards an open table.  I can see the wheels working in her head - people from the outside come inside and they are seeking... seats?...What else will she learn tonight?   My bubble is not burst, I am actually unaware of the slippery slide towards mediocre restaurant experience I am headed towards. So, we are seated and we rummage a bit thru the menu, note the artisan pizzas, the bruchetta, the hummus, cheese plate, salads, pretty simple fare. Wine menu is nice and I'm thrilled by the flights. Nothing fantastic that I couldn't find for $12 at CostPlus but still 3 glasses of either white  or reds sounds perfect. Then I notice Sangria...I luv the sangria.. Prepared to order but wait, where is the staff?   They pass to the right, they pass to the left..but they never stop. We are told on 2 separate occasions, our waiter, whose name escapes me but after an hour in his company I came to call Dude, was busy. Interesting, the restaurant is not.  We waited a half an hour to put in our drink order...Dude approached us and asked, \"So, you ready to get your party on?\" Oh, Dude. It is going to be a long night. A round of beers for the boys and the girls split a pitcher of sangria.   After our drinks and food arrive, I come to realize why Dude talks the way he does - Okay, let's party! Now, like Dude what can I get you? So, does everyun' get their drink on here? And why,everything seems so faintly familiar... Bcz the bruchetta, the sangria, and the staff are all courtesy of Applebees. Yes, the toasted Safeway french bread loaf with the jarred olive tapenade, the canned tomato spread and the artichoke spread would make any Applebees fryline cook weep with joy over its mediocrity. The sangria came in a sexy tall pitcher with what  appeared to be pre-chewed apples floating at the top and tasted like grape juice with an applesauce floater - a tribute to a cheap rip off of a classic.   There were some high points. The hummus was fresh and the pita chips were nicely oiled and toasted. The Perrone beer was on tap and great. The pizza - I have no complaints and its high points are that it was not the bruchetta.   So, La Bocca you are really good lookin' but you need to figure out what it takes not to be the Applebees of wine bars, we have enough of those.",

I had the Chicken & Spinach Pizza and it was clean, grease free, and very very good.  Top that off with good atmosphere and a glass of wine and I was set.  The personal-sized pizzas are not overwhelming and I didn't feel like a blob on my way out the door.     For all you dieters out there, this would make a great cheat meal....*nudge *nudge",

La Bocca was offering our group discounts etc...  We arrived at roughly 9p and waited and waited for the wait staff to acknowledge us. At this point 35 minutes had pasted. No luck. I approached a waiter and was told \"I am not with the Ignite party and can't help you. I will see if I can find someone for you.\"   We waited another 10 minutes and decided to leave. I think 45 minutes is a long time to wait to even see a waiter.",

    "text": "Dude!!   So we are still new to town and had a friend of mine come in for the weekend where we had planned on going to Pizzeria Bianco however, after calling to check the wait and hearing 4 hours, we vetoed it almost automatically.... seriously 4 hours for pizza? WTF??   So we head to Tempe and scope Mill looking for somewhere fun where we can have a light meal and prep ourselves for a long Saturday night of mischief.  My girl notices LaBocca however at first our party shrugs because the place was nearly empty, at 10 pm, on a Saturday.... not good, especially since I had never even bothered to Yelp the place.  After looking at the menu and noticing that the plates look rather tasty and are pretty decently priced we shluff it up on go on in.   Our server, Matt, was incredible! he knew the wines almost to a T and suggested a smoked Salmon bruschetta that wasn't on the menu, which may I add was AMAZING.   I had the Organic Seasonal Pizza which made my taste buds scream in ecstasy from the fresh, locally grown produce and oh so sweet and tangy balsamic vinigarette, my buddy had a shaved steak sandwich on Chibatta served with homemade potato chips and my girl had a Bacon, Procuitto and caramelized onion pizza which had me and my buddy  fighting like rabid dogs over her leftover crust.   What really topped the night was when we found out that we were on reverse happy hour and our tab was only 69 dollars!!   I could write on and on about this place and am VERY impressed with the service, waitstaff knowledge and menu selection, if your craving a great fresh meal that is out of this world but don't want snotty people, a pricy tab or a long wait this place has your name all over it!   I'll definitely be back!!",

    "text": "T and I stumbled into this place from wandering the street festival taking place that weekend.  It's one thing to have a simple menu and get really good at it.  Well, keep working at it.  Maybe I was tired from a day of paddling dragon boats in Tempe Town Lake? Maybe it was the Arizona sun?  Maybe I needed a nap? Maybe I was dehydrated?  I knew I wanted a drink.  I started with the Hoegaarden, my fave white ale that's great for summer.  We eyeballed the other tables and saw some interesting dishes, but nothing compelling.  I wanted pasta, but we settled on the bruschetta, as there was no pasta on the menu.  That seemed strange to me.  The red peppers and babaganoush bruschetta, among others was tasty.  Spinach and prosciutto was good, but frankly the prosciutto was lost in the spinach, which drowned the distinctive salty flavor of the italian cured ham.  My impression is that La Bocca is more of a wine bar that serves appetizers and smaller/lite sandwiches, salads, and pizzas.  If you're looking to \"eat\" - this isn't your place.  If you're looking to \"drink\" then \"eat\" - this may be your place.",

Nothing out of the ordinary, but good.    The pizza with chicken, pesto, and sun-dried tomatoes was delicious.  They definitely didn't skimp on the toppings.  It was a bit oily though, and this being a classy place I couldn't exactly blot the crap out of it like I used to do back in the day at Pizza Hut.   The red sangria - yum!! - was in a good sized wine glass filled to the brim, and I think it had some mint or basil in it.      The service was just okay.  The waitress seemed to lack that essential job skill of being able to \"read the table.\"   She gave us loads and loads of time to look over the menu and then came back and said \"Do you need another minute?\"  Umm, not unless there's gonna be an exam later.    When my water glass was totally empty, she came by empty-handed and asked if I wanted more.  Duh...  A while after we'd finished eating and were ready to go, she looked confused/surprised when we asked for the bill, like \"Oh.. Okay.\"  That was a little odd but didn't detract too much from the overall experience, and I'm sure I'll be back.  The food and sangria are worth it.",

    "text": "Went to La Bocca on a tuesday night.  Wasn't too busy.  Was there with a group of 7 people.  Our server was very nice.  So the establishment is very nice but my food was bad...like real bad.  I ordered the Chicken Limone.  My chicken was extremely dry.  Like it was cooked three days ago and sat out dry. There was no way this was cooked that night.  I personally never send food back unless I get what I didn't order.  Because obviously they don't cook their chicken to order so I didn't want another dry cold piece of chicken that was cooked more than 24 hours ago.  The pasta was stuck together so it did not cook all that great.  This bothered me less.  Everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy their food, which was disappointing to me.  Should have stuck to one of their salads or Bruchesta's.  The only redeeming thing was the pizza cookie.  Glad I ordered it, or i'd have to stop and get some FillyB's to fill me up from the meal I barely ate.  Honestly I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.  There are much better places in the area.  I know it looks swanky and cool, but I just don't see my self ever going back.",

    "text": "In the chaos that was downtown Tempe on St. Patrick's Day, we stumbled upon this recently opened pizza and wine bar.  A few parties were scattered across the restaurant around 6:30pm, but filled in quite nicely as we finished our meal.  The interior is upscale without being stuffy.  Floor to ceiling curtains hide the kitchen, exposed brick walls and mirrored dividers contribute to the intimate setting.  The bar has a large mural of a 16th century woman which somehow remains the focal point of the restaurant without being creepy.    Our server was friendly and gave us plenty of time to be indecisive.  We finally ordered the bruschetta starter ($12) which allows you to pick four out of eight different offerings.  My group settled on prosciutto, goat cheese and spinach, kalamata olive with basil ricotta, caprese, and sausage with eggplant babaganoush.  It's served on a wood cutting board with pitted olives.  This is one of the best starters I've had in a while.  Big thick pieces of toasted bread, cut in two, perfect for sharing over a glass of wine.  The prosciutto and caprese were my personal favorites but all were a definite hit!    We also ordered a couple of Caesar salads ($7 each), which were decent but nothing extraordinary and a little over dressed, and three pizzas ($12-13 each): Prosciutto, fungi and sausage.  The pizzas were good, each combination carefully selected with complimenting flavors.  My favorite was the sausage, served with roasted fennel.   The prosciutto had the right balance of crisp prosciutto, artichokes and capers. These two were a little heavy on sauce for my taste, but it didn't overwhelm the toppings. The mushroom pizza, a white pizza, could have been better by less white mushrooms and more crimini and maybe some chantrels.   The wine list is not extensive but carefully chosen and our Paso Robles Cab went well with all our selections.  They were out of the Argentinian Malbec, sigh, it's my favorite.    La Bocca was a delightful change from the rowdy college scene of Mill Avenue, but at a price point comfortable enough for anyone to enjoy.  We'll definitely make a point of stopping in next time we're in Arizona.",

It might have helped that one of the people in my section was apparently personal friends with the waiter.  I could see that he was busy so I was a little more patient than I usually am.   The problem I have is they knew we were coming. They'd chosen to host the after party for a major Tempe event and still didn't have enough staff. Many people waited a long time for service and some gave up completely.   I ordered one of their garlic pizzas and it was nice. A little much for my Little Caesars palate, but I managed to pick off what I think were green tomatoes and the rest was fine.    Our drinks and pizzas were discounted and I didn't have to wait long for my check as some people did.   So although my personal experience wasn't bad, as a group we were not pleased.",

    "text": "Love this place!!  My wife who thankfully handles our home finances made a comment the other day that I must love La Bocca because it is on my credit card statement about 2x/week.  I know that sounds crazy but I work on Mill Avenue.  No, I am not a street performer but work for a local advertising agency and the restaurant options if you are looking for good pizza and wine or beer is non existent.  I have tried about 1/2 the menu and all delicious.  The service and atmosphere is great and the managers/owners make us feel quite welcome and wanting to go back.  If you are in the Mill Ave area definitely stop into La Bocca.  Start out with their awesome bruschetta planks appetizer for $12.  You get 4 bruschetta but can mix and match from about 8 or so different kinds. My fav is the prosciutto, fig, mascarpone, and truffle oil.  I know that sounds odd (fig??) but its really really good.  I would recommend for lunch either going for the turkey & brie sandwich or margarita pizza with your favorite topics. Pepperoni is great.  They also have really good beer.  Try either the Franziskaner, Dunkelweiss, or Hoegaarden.  Probably first menu (is it obvious?) that I have memorized and don't mind that I did.  Happy hour deals are also awesome.  I wish there was a La Bocca in North Scottsdale as I would probably end up going on the weekend too as I live in that area.",

Only complaint about the food was that the beet salad seemed to be mostly tomatoes. Everything else was very, very good, Our server was really nice and helpful, and when her shift finished before we did, she brought the server who would be taking over for her to the table to introduce her. A nice touch.  Their cocktail list is very fun and diverse, and they also have a well-selected list of wines and beers.",

I'm surprised to hear that people feel that the food is not good and overpriced and that they have gotten horrible service.   The Food: The pizza here is amazing. Top quality fresh ingredients. Anybody who says otherwise probably doesn't have a mature palette. Yes, if you are looking for a standard, greasy NYC pizza, go to slices around the corner. (Which is also good, just different.) However, if you are looking for a fresh meal that you can leave feeling good, go here.  The Price: I think this place is well priced for what you get - Fresh Ingredients that complement each other. If you aren't full after eating here and think it is too pricey because of your unfulfilled appetite, I have two things to say.  1. You need to reduce your portions- My husband and I can share a pizza here and be full.  2. You need to understand that price isn't always based on quantity, but quality.  The Service: Every time I go to this place, the servers (not just the one waiting my table) are always amazing. In fact, they are so good you would think they were the owner. On top of being prompt, they always are very descriptive and helpful.",

The pizza was alright, but kinda small. It is a pain in the ass to find a way to get here. If you are already hanging out in the area I can see coming here, I guess. The servers are friendly and all, but I guess I can't give anything more than 3 stars because of the other options near here that I have no choice but to compare them to.",

Tonight we shared the antipasto board, the Brussels pizza & the Bocca Trio pizza. All of our food tasted good, but the antipasto & Brussels were stand outs. Antipasto had bread & olives from local business and the elephant garlic & pesto were insanely tasty. Brussels pie was cheesy & delish.   Service was a bit spotty, but our server seemed to be covering tables in all areas of the restaurant, so I give him a pass on that.   Overall a nice dining experience on Mill - we will be back!",

Margarita was a standard fare, but pretty good flavors. Excellent service  and good ambience. Would definately try again when back in Tempe.",

The atmosphere of the restaurant is very open and comfortable and we were seated in a nice booth lined with pillows.  Our server, Eric, was incredibly knowledgeable and provided excellent service.  I opted for the red sangria to start and it came garnished with oranges.  It was a bit more tart than other sangrias I have had so if you're looking for a sweet sangria, our waiter recommended the white.  We ordered the Sicily pizza and I was definitely not disappointed.  The crust was absolutely perfect!  Very light and slightly crispy but not too thin.  The goat cheese combined with the sausage, shallots and sun dried tomatoes were a treat for the tastebuds and my tummy!  Very good flavor and just enough to share between 2  to 3 people.   I normally don't order dessert but when I saw they had Tirimisu (which is my favorite), I had to try it.  I wish I had snapped a photo because even the presentation of the dessert was amazing.   I was not disappointed at all after the first bite.  It was light, fluffy, and the had the perfect amount of coffee flavor and custard.  Delicious!   I was very pleased and will be back again and again!",

We ordered the margarita pizza which I thought were delicious (though not the best, given that I've had better options in NYC).

Really simple menu between bruschetta, salads, pizza, or calzone. Their water is amazing. So refreshing with the cucumber flavor. Mmm  And a fairly extensive wine menu as well  (small beer selection). Our server was a little aloof but the service was still really good. Drinks always full. And I LOVED how they waited to bring out the next course until you finished the first so your table isn't cluttered with plates. The Calzone was HUGE! I have never seen one so big in my life! My hubby and I shared and couldn't finish. Really good too. It was packed with the filling and had a very thin crust. So overall it was really nice but we tried almost everything on the menu so we will probably move on to experience new places.",

We also ordered the bruschetta- pesto, olive, artichoke, and mozzarella.

We liked all of them, and will def go back to try the pesto. We than had 2 pizzas- garlic & we created our own with sausage. I only had the sausage one but really liked it. We were full, but couldn't resist the OMG dessert, an espresso brownie with ice cream on top, DH & I will go back for sure.

My friend and I were seated at a table by the window and noticed it was even warmer there, but as it was the only table in the place open...Although we had delicious brushetta and salads (and their great pinot grigio 'Little Black Dress') we didn't enjoy them much as the temp in the room had to be over 85 degrees. Our leisurely dinner turned into less than an hour and lets get out of here. But the place was PACKED so I guess most people didn't mind eating and sweating. Maybe that is how they manage to turn the tables over quickly???",

    "text": "We took my dad for the first time tonight.  My dad is Italian and a tough critic when it comes to pizza... He officially declared that we would be eating here at least once every time he comes to town.  We all agreed it's better than his former favorite, Humble Pie.  His initial observation was that the atmosphere was great- and he's right.  The decor is simple, hip and classy.  The restaurant is spacious and not over crowded with tables.  However, the tables themselves weren't quite big enough to hold all the food we ordered.  Once we all had a glass of water, beers for my dad and husband and sangria for myself, there wasn't a whole heck of a lot of room on the table left for food and serving plates.    Every time we've been here the staff has been wonderful to my daughter.  Both of the male servers we've had have totally doted on her.  There was plenty of space for her to toddle around our table and the high chairs have always been nice and clean (there's nothing worse than a crusty high chair).  We asked if they could bring her anything to snack on while we waited for our antipasti and pizzas so they brought her a little side of pear slices, crackers and cheese while we waited for our food.  Perfect!  Kept her happily nibbling til more food came.    The antipasti we ordered as a starter was delicious!  The giant hunks of elephant garlic were roasted til they were soft, sweet and tender.  And the proscuitto-wrapped goat cheese was great.  We had a debate over who would eat the last one.  (Dad got it... he weeded our whole yard today.  It's the least I could do!) For pizzas we ordered the mushroom and the Sicily (how could we NOT with our Sicilian roots).  The Schreiner's sausage was great, but the most Sicilian thing in the room was my dad.  There's nothing all that \"Sicilian\" about the pizza overall, other than the fact that it's fantastic (as all things Sicilian are).  But to me, Sicilian flavors incorporate far more fresh produce and seafood.  Regardless of my opinions of the definition of Sicilian cuisine, bottom line: Sicily pizza = yum.  However, the mushroom pizza might have been the BEST mushroom pizza I've ever had.  The goat cheese was mildly sweet and super creamy which was a great contrast to the full earthy flavors of the mushrooms and truffle oil, and it came with a generous serving of fresh spinach on top.  I always look forward to coming back here.  It's inexpensive enough to always order our tried and True favorites, along with something new and exciting.",

    "text": "I was soo wanting to like this place... Hottie boyfriend came home one night and said \"hey, I saw this cool wine bar on Mill that didn't play techno music or look too pretentious...\" Sweet I thought so we went a few days later. Only a few tables were taken late on a Saturday night, we were in luck (so we thought). Waitress was decent but didn't enlighten us as to the fact that they had flights of wine. Fortunately I did not experience the \"dude\" guy I've read about in other posts but I don't doubt he's alive and well there.  Let's fast forward with the server/patron banter so I can save you the agony... We tried a Chilean wine that was amazingly dark, thick, and chocolatey. The bruschetta got us hook line and sinker with all the amazing flavor combos like fig-prosciutto-marscarpone...but I thought bruschetta was toasted bread? Maybe it's like the Wendy's breakfast commercial and panini really does mean eggy-bacon-boat...but I digress. So we got  the bruschetta and I wanted to pretend like I was 9 and scrape of the toppings and not eat the stale un-toasted bread. But wait - the final piece was toasted and actually warm...and it wasn't that bad.  I really wanted to like this place - it's a perfect people watching spot on Mill (itself worth the price of a glass of wine). We had a good time despite the food but I'm not sure I can get into cold untoasted bruschetta, no matter how hard they try to dazzle you with fancy schmancy topping-bling.",

The atmostphere is defeinitely more upscale than typical Mill Ave options, teetering on snobbish but that's part of why I like it. The bruscetta and pizza are pretty tasty but I need to go back and dig a little deeper into both the wine and food menus.",

They also have really cool wine deals during their happy hour.

    "text": "Bruschetta, Bruschetta, Bruschetta! + Dinner with a Movie?!  Their \"planks\" of bruschetta are delicious. We picked out four different types with all different attitudes. My favorite was always like a dessert. Prosciutto, sliced figs, mascarpone cheese, and white truffle oil. This was amazing, it was sweet and creamy with the fig and mascarpone, and salty with the cured prosciutto. Another one of my favorites was the Sun-dried Tomato and Goat Cheese. Whoa, again the combination of ingredients was just wonderful. The Sun-dried tomatoes were so juicy and sweet, then with melted salty goat cheese and basil on top. Delicious!  The \"bruschetta planks\" are quite filling for two people so we moved right onto the pizza. We heard the pizzas were excellent, and that was spot on. We split a Truffle Harvest Mushroom Pizza. It was awesome combination of ingredients, (olive oil, tomatoes, goat cheese, mushrooms, and a baby spinach) The spinach was really interesting, they tossed it in a vinaigrette and laid it on top of the pizza.   Honestly, I think we came on the perfect night (Sunday), our bottle of wine was HALF OFF! That came as a pleasant surprise, but then I guess they were doing a new thing on Sunday evenings where they turned the lights down and started a movie on their giant projection screen! Casablanca was the movie that evening. Our server told us they play a different film every week. Everything for classics (Casablanca), to comedies (Wedding Crashers). We stayed for the whole film (like everyone else) and was very happy with the feeling of the place. Thanks La Bocca!  I am definitely coming back for another Sunday Movie Night!",

When we asked about ordering after being seated for 30 minutes, we were told by our server that they were busy and we'd need to wait. Once the food started coming out, it took a while for everyone in our party to receive their food--my meal was cold by the time the last dish arrived.

The summer peach arugula salad had old dried peaches and had very little arugula mixed with other greens.

    "text": "P and I came here for dinner a couple of Fridays ago hoping for something along the lines of Le Grande Orange/Postino, but in Tempe (at least their menu looked that way). We started with some wine and she had a an OK cocktail (it had a fancy name but was really just orange juice and vodka) while we perused the menu. We finally decided on some bruschetta, a chopped salad and a pizza.   The bruschetta came out first, two fig and prosciutto, a spinach, blue cheese and onion and a smoked salmon with capers and chef's tartar. They were all just OK. The bread was average, the toppings were skimpy (even the red onions on the spinach bruschetta) and they were poorly seasoned. The salad also needed some salt and pepper, at least that's what we had to offer it table-side. At that point our waitress came by and asked if she could get us anything else or if we just wanted to stick with the apps. I wasn't sure if this was a trick question or not because was she considering our pizza an appetizer? No. She forgot, admitted it, then asked us if we wanted it. Yes. Yes, we want our pizza.   Our sicily pizza came pretty quick and smelled great. It was topped with Schreiner's \"sicilian\" sausage, sundried tomatoes, parmesan and goat cheese, shallots and herbs. We dug right in but again, someone in the back doesn't believe in seasoning. We ate what we could and left the rest there.   It's a shame because La Bocca has such a nice ambiance and their menu looks so promising. Maybe I'll try them again sometime in the fall when it's cool enough to sit on the patio, for now I'll stick with what tastes good.",

    "text": "Tasty, great vibe and best sangrias in town!  I've dined here a few times, and each time has been amazing, the pizzas are all so delicious. I think I've had a slice of each one and every one of them is amazing. You can also custom order a pizza. I like their sausage pizza but add ricotta on it. Yummers!  The sangrias is what makes me come back and think fondly of this place. Get a pitcher or two and share with a friend. Such a great time. I recommend their red over the white, simply because the red is more flavorful and not too sweet.   The prices are extremely affordable. Being close to ASU campus I guess you have to be if you want to survive catering to the college student budgets. I love the atmosphere. Very young, hip, but not divey like a typical pizza joint near a college campus. The service is average. Not great, but never bad service. It's always crowded and they seem to hire mostly college kids, but the service is always pretty good.  The parking isn't the best, but it's expected when you're hanging on busy and crowded Mill. One of my must do dining experiences if your down this way.",

They also have a good assortment of wines and I was also impressed that Tito's was their well vodka. However, service was AWFUL! It took about 15 minutes before our drinks got to us, our waters were never refilled, and to boot, our server dropped our checks while we were all still eating and expected us to pay halfway through our meal? No, no, no. Disappointing.",

I also find myself paying for others to ensure they'll go with me again :)    The ambiance is fantastic, and wait staff is attentive and friendly.   Also try the bruschetta | options: get the pork if you like sweet and spicy, get the traditional mozzerella, basil & tomoto, the chicken - - heck, try them all!  Oh wait! I almost forgot, the Tiramisu -  is def something to write home about!",

    "text": "After hearing my friends rave about this place since its opening I decided to come here for a semi-upscale date night with my partner.  The ambiance is 'cute.' The dining room is a dark, lofty, wine cellar-ish space with a Netflix projection on the back wall. Some tables have couch seating, especially on the patio, though most of the inside tables are wooden along with a few high tables. Like the couple seated next to us, it would be romantic and comfortable for those on a first date.   We arrived around six PM on Saturday, a good hour before it would start getting any sort of busy. We were a bit disappointed to be seated at one of the uncomfortable wooden seating areas rather than be seated at a couch, but that's not the end of the world. Although, there was some sort of dark, sticky substance stuck under the table. I assumed it was a result of a balsamic vinegar spill but I'm not sure why it would have thickened to the under-table.  After being seated we waited an unusually long time before our waiter introduced himself... by that time we had already decided what we wanted to drink and an app start with. Instead of taking our drink order he let us know that select wines were on sale and that we should look those over for when he comes back, then he rushed back to the kitchen. When he came back we ordered the sangria carafe we'd previously intended to, to which he confirmed, \"just so you know, that isn't on sale.\" I hope the service isn't this awkward when it's busy.  The sangria was nice and sweet with a surprising (and maybe a bit out of place) kick of cinnamon.   We started with bruschetta planks - delicious and creative. For our meal we ordered the Porco pizza - I don't even like pork but it's hearty and shredded addition was undoubtably craveable.   We ordered the creme brulee for dessert and licked that plate clean -- nuff said! Only before that my partner started to feed me a spoon of the dessert and THAT was when our waiter decided to stop by and see how we were doing. Laughing at the awkward, we were just fine.",

Our server was extremely attentive and great at making recommendations. She remembered one of our guests was Vegan so always shared alternative menu options for him. Our food came out in a timely manner and everything was so tasty!! Quality ingredients, all of the bruschettas were yummy - the table voted that the Prosciutto was the favorite. My manager wanted to come back the next night if she could. We'll definitely be planning more corporate outings here at La Bocca, thank you for the excellent service :)",

It's very laid back and the service is very accommodating and fun. Here you'll see small groups of girls/women dining, and a multitude of couples. I definitely recommend the bruchetta and grab a glass or two of wine.  They have a large screen playing movies (last time I was in it was playing Lebowski...so PLUS!) and the whole ambiance/design/decor what have you is relaxing, rustic, and unique. A great place for lunch or dinner. They also had some good tunes playing. Very urban rustic casual...if that even makes sense. check it out!",

They specialize in pizza. We came during their happy hour--only on select drinks. We were given time to look at the menu... a lot of time! It was as if they forgot about us. Impossible, because the restaurant was filled probably 15-20% capacity.  After ~15-20 minutes of reading the menu (probably two or three times) we ordered (finally!). I got the bocca trio which had 3 different types of meat--that was pretty good! My friend got the margarita--impossible to mess up. My other friend got the Garlic which, in my opinion, tasted TOO garlicy. I only had one slice of her pizza and told myself no more.  I think the reason why this is a 3 star review instead of a 4 star review is because the waitress was just very cold towards us. I don't know if she was just having a bad day. Don't get me wrong, she wasn't mean or anything, but just the air around her felt very unwelcoming.   Try it out? Maybe you'll get a more happier wait staff when you go",

Food is good, wine list is extensive, service is friendly, but, it's something else that makes me a regular here - their Truffled Mushroom pizza.   I have to declare that I am not a salad person and I would pick meat over veggies in a heartbeat, BUT, this pizza is heaven on a flatbread. The balsamic vinaigrette tossed fresh spinach over crumbled goat cheese tease your taste buds with the right amounts of tang and mush. The flatbread and the mushrooms play their part in taking you into a food coma with every bite.  My hubby savors the precious moments when this pizza melts the hardcore carnivore in me to a thing of the past. The only place where sharing my pie is never an option, and, boxing it up even more so!  On another note though, it's hard to believe their pastas come from the same kitchen. They are awful. Rest of their pies are mediocre at best. The bruschettas are divine. Yes, they are as good as Postinos minus the long wait and with better service. Olives are locally sourced and served nice and warm. Perfect for a winter date night on the patio.",

We had the Bruschetta Plank, which is a great concept we'd never seen.  You get to choose 4 different types of bruschetta from the list and they bring them out on a wood plank to share.  It was beyond delicious!!  And the arugula, beet and goat cheese salad we split was perfect.  La Bocca hit the spot.  I wish we had one in our town in Southern California!

It was almost a bad experience but ended up being a good one.  The reason that it was almost bad was because of the length of time it took to have someone come over to the table.  My girlfriend was seated on the patio while I parked the car.  After I joined her it was at least another 10 minutes before anyone came over.  We began looking at the Yelp reviews and almost got up and left when our server came over.  He definitely made up for the wait and saved the day.  I think his name was McKenley.  We told him we were on a time crunch as we had to make the show so we ordered everything at once.  He put everything in right away and I have to say I was impressed with how quickly we received our food.  We had a bruschetta board with various types of combinations and we made our own pizza.  The board wasn't bad.  I have had better and I have also had worse.  Maybe it was just the ones we picked.  The pizza was very tasty.  The crust was done well and had a great flavor to it.  We were even able to have some dessert while we were there.  The chocolate chip cookie with mint ice cream was delicious, though be warned it is made with real mint so it does not taste like the stuff you can by at the grocery store.  All in all it was a good experience and customer service saved the day.  I would have no problem going back when in the area and I recommend this place if you are looking to grab a bite.",

Servers were friendly and attentive, and I am pretty sure no one waited on a drink order or a refill all night. Chow was plentiful, especially the appetizer platters. Hummus plates were very tasty.  Pizza/pasta plates were well received by all, and there were few leftovers. Lastly, the tiramasu was downed by those who exclaimed, \"just a taste\". On the downside, i could not hear anyone except those on my elbow -- they need to turn the music down. Also, I felt like I was in coach seating to Europe, but on a butt-numbing wooden chair. Otherwise, an okay experience.  Cheers! RS",

Bruschetta is a must and always a great option to try a variety of the options! I have been here before and always a great meal. Whether its the salads, pizza or wine - just go for all 3 :)  Tonight we had the red sangria and it tasted a little different than usual. From my perspective the red sangria tasted like Christmas potpourri in a cup. Although that being said, the more you drank the more i was accustomed to the taste. Great unconventional twist on the red. Maybe give it a whirl and try the white!",

    "text": "Happy Hour Review:  We came for the Tempe Arts Fair,<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/tempe-arts-festival-tempe#hrid:mFf-pIdZ8gGArDYHL4-YgA\">yelp.com/biz/tempe-arts-...</a>  but decided to checkout the Happy Hour at La Bocca.  For the last three years, this restaurant and it's Chef Julian Wright is all anyone can talk about.  It feels like Phoenix's New Times writes about him at least once a week. LOL   AMBIANCE: Mill Avenue continues to change with the times and reinvent itself -- something we like!  We chose to sit outside and people watch since it was still early.  Inside the restaurant has a modern 1940s feel which is really very nice.  CLIENTELE: Here's an interesting category.  Mill Avenue and the restaurants are a mixture of older college kids from ASU (21+), along with Alumni of all ages.  You also have people like us who just like the vibe of the area.  MENU: They've made some changes in their Happy Hour menu, but everything is still excellent! Most items from the bar are $3.00 during HH, that also includes shots.  So it really is a watering hole. We really like their Rojo Sangria, and it's a very reasonable at $22.00 for a 750 ml Carafe, btw. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Flaboccapizzeria.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2012%2F12%2F2012-WINTER-WINE-LIST.pdf&s=35fe1a72a14eab7b8783e0fce67118261716ce82b40b9852b68c4cdd9d4a7d6e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">laboccapizzeria.com/wp-c...</a>  SERVICE: Is a tag team affair, but our server Alex was outstanding.  He stayed on top of things and came back to check in from time to time.  When we mentioned Yelp, he told us how customers have written some very nice reviews about the restaurant and one had even mentioned his service.  Well Alex, here's your second nod.  You were great, and we would come back to your section anytime!   FOOD: The food at LaBocca is mostly Italian with some tweaks to the concept.  A good example is their Harvest Chop Salad for $8.00 which we enjoyed.  There's a nominal $2.00 up-charge for the split, but it was subtle and very nice. It had a light Dijon mustard vinaigrette dressing, over tubetti pasta, romaine lettuce, bacon, tomatoes and some blue cheese.  It was delicious and the blue cheese was very mild, almost Gorgonzola-ish.    Next we had their famous Margarita pizza was $9.00 (see photo). La Bocca is known for their pizzas. It was made with some crushed San Marzano tomatoes and mozzarella.  It also had a rough cut of basil leaves on top.  We liked it a lot, but also enjoy the pizza at Pomo's on Scottsdale Road for the real Neopolitan stuff.   For dessert we shared each others -- Tiramisu $ 5.00 (photo) and Fresh Mint Chip Ice Cream $6.00.  A nice ending to a wonderful meal. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Flaboccapizzeria.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2013%2F02%2Flabocca-urban-pizzeria-lunch-dinner-menu.pdf&s=bb41a479686e74f9baa12660961d7c34654e313d3a9f60cbc3dd46b77ec8814f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">laboccapizzeria.com/wp-c...</a>  PRICES: Our bill came to $52.00 after taxes, but before gratuities.  It would have been less if we kept to the HH wine list but the carafe of Sangria (photo) was too good to pass up.  Enjoy!  We'll be back.  I guess people do really like them on Yelp!",

As in, don't drop off water, then wait a long time to take the drink order and have to be flagged down before you walk away for the appetizer order. And try to get the entree order in some time BEFORE the 30 minute mark. Also, asking if everything is ok would have been helpful since the pizza and appetizers were both cold.   The bruschetta (pronounced bruss -Ketta. Get it right if you are going to call yourself an Italian restaurant) was cold. Tasty, dry bread, and cold. One pizza was hot, the other room temperature, maybe a bit warmer.  Overall, disappointing service with good-ish food.",

We were torn between sitting inside or outside but ultimately chose the patio seating because the weather at 9:00 night was too perfect to pass up. We also got to gaze at walkers as they passed.   The tables had cute candles lit which emphasized the romantic atmosphere as well. There was couches with coffee tables to lounge and eat if sitting at a table isn't your thing.   Menu here is very simplistic but divine. After reading reviews of the bruschetta appetizer we had to try and I must note it was delectable. My favorite was the pesto with roasted tomatoes on top. Each piece was constructed with care and flavorful. We shared a pizza with garlic, basil, roasted tomatoes and pepperoni and it was extremely fresh and I loved the brick oven quality of it.   Service was courteous and insightful for explaining different items and drinks on the menu. I highly recommend this as a date night spot.",

They welcomed us inside and we were seated within ten minutes. The very friendly waiter listened to our special request (garlic allergy at an Italian restaurant--sad but True), then checked with the kitchen, and returned to make recommendations about what they could (and could not) adapt. The food was fresh and quite good. We enjoyed a lovely caprese bruschetta and salad, and a glass of a nice full-bodied red wine (I forget what it was but the waiter recommended it). Even if the food hadn't been good...they made us feel like our enjoyment of the food and our evening mattered...and sometimes when you're traveling that matters most.",

    "text": "This place hovers between a 3- and 4-star rating. I saw the Groupon for La Bocca and didn't get it, because I'm not a pizza fan for the most part unless it's truly amazing. After dining there, I couldn't help comparing it with La Grande Orange Pizzeria: both boast gourmet pizzas and fancy appetizers with similar price points. I personally prefer LGO's pizza because of the better/thinner crust and higher-quality cheese.   La Bocca's wood-fired pizza -- for the record, the porco/pulled pork pizza -- did not give me the bubbling cheese impression when it first came out; instead, the cheese was stiff and lukewarm. Also, the pork pieces were scantily and unevenly distributed, hardly meaty at all. So don't mistake the porco pizza for a meat lover's heaven. The pulled pork was certainly porky (= greasy) but not juicy or flavorful.  On a side note, La Bocca's leftover pizza slices did not make a satisfying meal the following day -- the reheated dough was rock-hard and inedible. On the other hand, LGO's leftover pizza was still delicious 3 days later.  As for its famed bruschetta appetizers, I saw the appeal but didn't get it. We got prosciutto, pesto, garlic, and ricotta bruschettas. My reaction: Mehhh. They were filling (admittedly lots of carbs) but far from something I would go back for. They taste quite the same to me and the bread wasn't my favorite.   If you want to make good bruschetta at home, here's a recipe:  1) sourdough crisps (from Costo) 2) goat cheese 3) fig jam 4) Assemble 1 + 2 + 3. Voila!  Maybe I'm spoiled by easy-and-yummy bruschettas I can make at home, I was definitely not impressed by what I spent $12 for in La Bocca.   We also got the sangria. A lot of alcohol for its price; also a lot of syrup.   I agree La Bocca is a nice place to hang out with my ASU friends and a good alternative if I don't want to drive to LGO. It would be even nicer if I have a groupon to get a couple dollars off the bill. But it lacks the finess I was looking for in an outstanding pizzeria. Nice, but mediocre in my book.  P.S. valet parking good for 2 hours if you park in the garage nearby.",

    "text": "It actually pains me to give this place a less than stellar review.  I have been dying to try it after stopping in at the High street location awhile back, and seeing the fun wine bar vibe.  It was absolutely packed and so we had to dine somewhere else that particular evening.  Going out with friends over the weekend we decided to finally try this place and I was excited.   One of the main problems is I am not a huge fan of dining in Tempe.  So upon entering I already didn't like the vibe nearly as much as the one in Phoenix.   Our service was ok.  They were out of the wine I ordered (you're a wine bar right?) I thought what are the chances.  The one I chose in replacement was pretty good.  It was happy hour and I was glad I didn't have to pay full price, their glass prices are spendy.   Now on to the food.  Our dining companions ordered a couple bruschetta which were the tiniest bruschetta I've seen yet at a restaurant.  I was glad I had passed, even though they were on happy hour special.  I had a salad which was really good.  The homemade dressing was quite tasty.  My husband ordered the Porco pizza and I had a slice.  I was super excited to try it as the description was right up my alley.  It was flavorless.  There was no sauce on the pizza or the pork, which was considerably dry.  Not enough caramelized onions and there is no way those were Serrano peppers as they had ZERO spice.  It was disappointing to say the least. So all in all, this was a pretty big letdown due to the fact I'd been looking forward to dining here for quite some time.  I will not return to this location.  I MAY try the Phoenix spot, if I am in the area, but I won't make a special trip.  Bummer!",

From the live music to the perfectly dim lit atmosphere and the sweetest waitress, our meal was nothing short of wonderful. We went with the Bruschetta and had the prosciutto, Brie, Spanish, and mozzarella, all of which were phenomenal! I went with the Bocca 75 which was much smaller than I expected, but refreshingly delicious none the less. For dinner, we had the prosciutto alfredo and the autumn garden pizza, and thoroughly enjoyed both options! I was stuffed from the bruschetta, but it was all too delicious to pass up!   I can't wait to make this a stop on my next AZ visit and try some more of what looked like excellent options on the menu!",

The food was delicious. We had the cheese plate, antipasti plate, and bruschetta boards. Just before happy hour ended we ordered another round of drinks. Approximately 6:25pm. At 7pm we ordered pizzas and asked about our drinks. This was the 1st time our waitress had stopped to check on us since we ordered our drinks. Our drinks finally came around 7:45 and our pizzas came out at 8pm. Our waitress didn't come back until 9pm with our checks. We asked if they validated parking. We were told yes and given a voucher. The voucher did not work for parking.   Needless to say, the evening was disappointing and the staff was not prepared for this event.",

I loved the hummus and the babganoush that it came with. The cheese was good but a bit salty. For the entree we shared the truffled mushroom pizza. This thing was delicious!!!! Like reallyyyyy delicious! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Lol for drinks I ordered the red sangria and my friend got the orange blossom martini. I wasn't too fond of my sangria. I think it could've been a bit sweeter.   I would definitely come back for their pizza. They also have happy hour and reverse happy hour on the weekends that I'd like to check out. It's a really cute little pizza place. Perfect for a date or even dinner with friends. They have a great outdoor patio and it's right on Mill Ave. So good for people watching. =)",

However, within 10 minutes, the hostess came out and offered the sofa/lounge area that fit us pretty well. It was hard to situate our food though, on the 2 small tables, especially since most of us were splitting dishes.  Here's what we ordered: Mojito - small glass, pretty refreshing with cucumber and on the strong side Prickly Pear Margarita - large glass, doesn't taste like a typical margarita fyi Long Island - strong! but gets the job done :)  Goat Cheese + Pear Salad - Yum! I'd ask for the vinaigrette dressing on the side, because the last few bites are very acidic.   Sicily Pizza with added mushrooms - about 10 inch size -- definitely enough for 1 hungry person and pretty yummy, but there wasn't much sauce. I highly recommend adding mushrooms because there wasn't that many toppings.  Other members of my party shared a calzone - those are massive! I definitely want to try one next time :)",

Whenever my boyfriend and I need to grab something to eat but can't figure out where to go, we always come here and are never disappointed. The food is always super fresh and tastes great and doesn't even take that long to come out. The service is also excellent, every time we visit we leave with smiles on our faces! The olives, caprese, sandwiches and pizza are great! As for everything else, I'm sure it's awesome too I just haven't gotten around to ordering anything else yet since I love my regular order so much. If you're ever in need of a yummy and super well priced meal, definitely stop by!",

Service: 3- someone else checked in under our reservation (how this happens, I'm not sure, but it did), so we were forced to wait an extra 45 minutes for a table. Once seated, service seemed kind of slow. Also, at some point during the evening while two of my friends had stepped out, these two random drunken people stumbled in to the restaurant and sat at our table. The management somewhat quickly asked them to leave, but I feel like it should have somehow been prevented.   Food: 4- While waiting at the bar we got bruschetta that was very delicious.  Tried almost all the flavors!  The pizzas were very good. Salads were mediocre.  Favorite pizza was the calabria. I didn't even get it, my friend did, but I wish I did! I'll be back just for this pizza it was SO GOOD!  Drinks: 4- Sangria is awesome and their wine list is nice.  I really enjoyed the sangria though, so I stuck with that.  If you're coming on the weekends definitely make a reservation.",

    "text": "Some friends and I decided to meet up for Happy Hour and La Bocca won our pick for new place to try out.  I was happy that there was parking basically right behind it so that I didn't have to walk too far from my car (you know me and my stilettos!)  The girls at the host station were friendly and greeted me right away, my friend already had a table though so I was able to walk right in.  Our server came over very quickly to take our drink order and tell us about happy hour.  Unfortunately for us the things we wanted (Sangria and the Orange Blossom Martini) were not included in the special.  We decided to get them anyway and were glad we did as they were both delicious.  The third member of our group showed up at that point and ordered herself a sangria as well.  Both of them ordered salads (caesar for her and caprese for him) but I wanted something with a bit more sustenance so I asked the server for his recommendation.  He said his favorite item was the Bocca Trio pizza which had tomatoes, pepperoni, salami, sausage and olives.  It sounded good and I figured my friends would need something more than leaves and seeds to tide them over so they could share mine.  The caprese salad should have been called a caprese plate because what came out was not a salad.  It was good, but it was about 4 basil leaves and then some mozzarella and tomato.  I would consider that more of an appetizer than an entree salad so he definitely shared my pizza.  The caesar salad was what you would expect and she seemed to enjoy it.  My Bocca Trio pizza was very good which was bad because my friends didn't take as much to share as I'd hoped and I was left with most of it when we finished.  I will definitely be coming back to La Bocca again and I can't wait to try some of their other offerings.",

    "text": "Started out very nervous. I had heard great things about this place and wanted to give a fellow ASU alum some business. I walked in and the hostess was not very friendly. In fact, I thought she was kind of rude. Maybe it was just me. I felt very awkward and uncomfortable for some reason but could not explain why. The restaurant itself is very pretty and hip. They also have a nice outside seating area leading to Mill and that wraps around 6th Street.     My experience did improve after a little while. I ordered the Truffle pizza. I asked them to add sausage because I saw it was real and Schrieners to boot, not that fake crumbly junky stuff. I also ordered a side salad. Well you can't do too much to kill a side salad so that was fine. The waiter and another gentleman staff member ( perhaps a manager) were great while I waited for my pizza. It kind of made up for the hostess!!!!! I would get rid of her. Okay maybe a chat first. lol    Well, then the pizza comes out and it is slightly burnt on top. Owhhhhhh, I hate when my pizza is burnt in any shape or form. I know that is the hip new way to eat pizza but not for me. I don't get it. Not this New York Gal. I like it with no burnt marks at all. I was all set to send it back when I decided to try it first.( I rarely send food back since I have a severe issue with waste) I have to tell you I thought it was very good. The spinach meshed perfect with this creamy goat cheese they use for a unique, yummy flavor. I really enjoyed it. I was not that crazy about the burnt crust though thus the 4 stars instead of five. I might come back again this Saturday after the run to try some other things.     What really saved the day was the nice waiter. He talked with me for a long while. He told me all about the owner and his other establishments. We talked shop, which means food. Teehee! The waiter seemed very glad to have me for a costumer. I like that. I wish I knew his name. I usually note that but after a long week of  testing I guess I just wanted to stuff my face with good pizza. lol! Manga!",

I love that you get to choose the four bruschetta you get on your plank; when I visit next time, I will probably have the beet/goat cheese/honey one for all four choices, as it was incredible.  We also really enjoyed the pesto.  We chose the Sicily pizza and found it wonderful.    We were fortunate to visit during beautiful weather, and ate on the patio.

    "text": "Walked in on Friday night and the hostess was very friendly and accommodating. We sat in a booth and sat and sat and sat. Servers walked by smiling over and over and not one asked if we had been helped or anything. Literally 15 minutes after being sat a very nice young lady came to us and apologized that she was busy and that no one else had stopped by. By this time we had already decided what we wanted so we ordered drinks, the mussels, the Beet Salad and the Salmon. Then we sat for at least 10 minutes waiting for our drinks and I could see them at the bar. They finally arrived and 30 seconds later the Mussels. My wife tried the Mussels and they were slimy and undercooked and smelled horrible. This is when everything goes down hill. I stopped a different server, told about the Mussels and told her we did not want a replacement. Next the Beet salad comes out. It was OK except the tomato was mushy and tasted funky. Now we order a second drink. 5 minutes later the Salmon comes out. Very bland and boring but we eat most of it anyway. Now at this time we are finished and still no drinks. Someone comes to take our plates and I ask if we had drinks sitting at bar.....yep I'll grab them. Now our waitress comes and asks if we want dessert. We say no thank you, just the check. She drops it off and the Mussels are still on check. I ask the waitress if anyone told her what had happened and she has no idea! She tells me she is going to talk to the manager \"Chad\". She comes back with the check and asks if everything else was ok. I basically let her know that this place has no cohesion with employees and management. I was blown away that \"Chad\" never came out to ask what had happened or to at least check on the situation. I checked Yelp after leaving to see that this is common here. Won't be back",

    "text": "My friend and I stopped by one night without reservations, so I had to sit at the bar.  No biggie, I just wanted a pre-concert nibbly & drink.  But... sitting at the bar, I still had to flag down the bartender to get a drink.  She was more interested in making sure she looked just so than getting my happy on bubbly! So finally, after getting a drink order, we decided to order bruschetta.  That shouldn't take too long..its on the appetizer menu, so at most....10 mins. About 30 mins later, I still couldn't get our bartenders attention for drink refills or to inquire on the delay in our food, so I started talking loudly about not getting to eat.  Finally, the other bartender stopped by to say: \"Wow, it sure is taking a long time to get your bruschetta\".  Um, yes....so get someone to go check on it please?  At that point, the chic interested in her appearance decided she should probably go see what was taking so long.  She disappeared to the kitchen, and I got hopeful about eating.  A few mins later she reappeared, but only to continue checking out her reflection in chrome and chatting with her coworkers.  Another conversation with me and the other bartender began and went along these lines: \"should bruschetta take 40 mins? I mean its just toppings & toast.  I really would like to eat.  I ordered and appetizer, because I didn't have all night to wait for food\".  Her response was something like: \"I guess there was a problem in the kitchen, and the guy making appetizers got hurt, so that throws everything out of order\"  ummm, ok.  But i have worked in enough restaurants, so you can't tell me that there isn't anyone capable of putting some meat on toast?  So... finally the manager arrives with the bruschetta, his apologies, and the comment that its on the house.  Yes, it should be.  When I asked as to the delay, the manager said the person making appetizers cut himself very badly and that caused the delay.  While I am truly sorry someone cut themselves, and I hope it wasn't serious, I still have to ask...  was there no one in the kitchen capable of making bruschetta? and what about the crappy bar service, while sitting at the bar? and why did I have to ask about my food, why wasn't the bartender all over that? even if you had to throw away all the ingredients and start from scratch, you think you could have told me that, rather than ignoring me for 40 mins?  So here is the deal La Bocca.  You have a good and interesting menu, but nothing so unique that you are the only place in town to get it.  There are plenty of other great wine bars, restaurants, and bruschetta peddlers in town.",

    "text": "While Mill Avenue remains a shadow of its former glory, there still are some great spots for grownups to have a good time.  La Bocca Urban Pizzeria & Wine Bar is one of those places.   I enjoyed a great Happy Hour and meal with a group of couples before walking down the street to Gammage for a show.  The restaurant has a nice modern hipster feel.  The tables have a bit of a picnic table feel to them, but not the cheap kind).  There's also a great patio that is on the alley side of the restaurant, so diners won't get pounded by the sun on a hot day and won't have to put up with too much of the Mill Avenue crowd.  The menu is exactly what you'd expect to find.  A satisfying mix of pizzas, pastas, salads, and bites, many made with ingredients from local vendors.  My table split a med plate (hummus, babaganoush, peppers, cheese and pita and flat bred.  The hummus wasn't the best in the valley, but the babaganoush was phenomenal.  We all had a variety of pizzas and salads.  I personally had the truffled mushroom.  Awesome first slice, but the over use of truffle oil eventually made hard to finish.  One friend checked in on Yelp and we received a free dessert.  We went with a warm white chocolate macadamia nut cookie (made with Sweet Republic's vanilla bean ice cream).  A perfectly baked little \"pizza cookie.\"   La Bocca is also coming to local dines (<a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.localdines.com%2Fphoenix%3Fref%3D19485&s=13f273d311728f7448ff75fcf55bdaf2585245ad2d7e3c3cc0823dcdee2befc9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">localdines.com/phoenix?r...</a>).  $30 for $15.

Wait was long, and lots of tables had beverages but no food. One savvy party entered, saw the service was slow, and left. Glad we paid for two hours of packing. When the food arrived it was delicious--hence 3 stars--but the service was lackluster. There was one waiter being diligent and attentive. But he wasn't ours.

    "text": "La Bocca is the definition of mediocre.   I ordered a pizza for dinner, and it was bad. Not terrible, but bad. The crust was burnt in a couple places, yet the dough at the center of the pizza was almost underdone, and soggy. A sure sign of an oven with uneven heating issues. I took one bite of a slice and all of the cheese and toppings slid off, because the sauce was very watery. Overall an amateurly done pizza.  I also ordered a lemoncello, and it came in the smallest glass I'd ever seen. I almost thought it was a joke. Maybe I'm just unaccustomed to how things are done in more \"upscale\" types of places, but I've never had a cocktail come in a doll's glass before, so it was a bit of a shock.   The service was meh. I got the impression our waitress would have rather been somewhere else.   I'm not sure why this place gets so many rave reviews. Maybe I went on a bad night. But for the price, I'm not really feeling the desire to give them a second chance.",

With great decor, lighting, and service, it's one of the only places in Tempe I would bring my girlfriend for a date. The interior has a unique feel and great ambiance, and the patio is comfortable and intimate. Next time your in you have to try the baba and hummus as an appetizer, and ask for Jackie.",

Being that it was my first time, she happily explained the menu & offered a couple of suggestions. I ordered a couple of bruchettas (a must have item) & the Sicilian pizza, along with the Leitz Out Riesling white wine. Everything was great! The ambiance of the restaurant altogether was pretty chill. I arrived close to 5:30 PM & didn't leave until around 8ish. I didn't have to raise my voice much to speak nor did I have to use my ears more to hear. Paintings on the walls & the entire decor was.. Again, cute! I loved everything. I will definitely go back. Btw, I'm not sure what time it started, but the Happy Hour ends at 6:30 PM.",

    "text": "Well, I had not gone to La Bocca in some time (at least all summer) and wow, what a pleasent surprise this Thursday evening. The establishment, if anything, continues to get better, and not just the food. Going into La Bocca on a Thursday night sort of feels like stepping into an episode of the hills with all the stylish folk around (glad I could be there to represent the older, less attractive, but have lots of discretionary income group).   I went about 7 pm and the place was well filled and out and management seems to have everything humming from an operational standpoint. My friend from Germany and I were quickly seated and the waiter, to his credit, started out by saying that he was going to get us some ice water and would then be back to get things started. It was a nice way to ease us into the evening. One thing I do recommend at this point La Bocca, get on the cucumber in the water trend. It is more refreshing than a lemon slice and right in alignment with the ambiance of the establishment.  Now, on to food, we started out with the bruschetta. The bread is basic baguette slices (might be a nice idea to toast them a bit folks) and they nicely cut them in half so my companion and I could each have a taste (at La Bocca you pick 4 of the eight toppings off the menu). The roasted garlic, goat chease, and balsalmic arugula was good but the mozz, basil, and roma tomate topping was even better. I was not a big fan of the artichoke, spinach and roasted pepper though the final topping, of prosciutto, fig, and mascarpone (think sweet ricotta cheese) made up for it. The one thing I would like to see is just a simple  topping of chopped roma tomatoes, olive oil and garlic, like they have up the street at Cafe Boa. Well, they have eight choices so I guess something for everyone.  For the main course I had the sicily pizze with local \"sicily\" sausage (no idea what that means), along with sun dried tomatoes, goat and parmesan cheese, some shallots, and other herbs. The toppings tasted good but a little busy. In other words, a little too much going on, but the crust, oh wow, write home on that one because it has only gotten better! I could have eaten the crust, with this crispy bubbles of crust, and its crunchy but chewy texture, and skipped everything else. I am surprised that the pepperoni with cave creek chili oil is no longer a standard on the menu. I think that simplistic pie is still my favorite though now I guess I have to do it from the \"make your own pie\" option.  For desert my German friend (well, an American expat in Germany), at the recommendation of the waiter, had the mint and chocolate chip ice cream. He said the mint tasted fresh picked and wow, it was fresh! The scoop is large so a good split for two people and the mint is a good way to freshen the breath at the end of a date if one is preparing for any sort of canoodaling later in the evening or just enjoy really good mint ice cream.  Finally, I had an espresso (my friend ordered the ice cream, I just tasted it) and the waiter told me they are working on getting their coffee supplies from Cartel Coffee Lab, which is a coffee roaster just down the street off Farmer and University. The coffee there is the best so a good idea and one more way to locally source what they offer, which is always a wonderful idea.  In summary, I can see why they got voted one of the top 25 restaurants in Phoenix and who would have thought it, right on Mill avenue. As that folk singer dude whose name I can't remember says, the times, they are a changing. :-)",

Like me, he travels frequently and likes to check out interesting food and see new places.  So I thought Mill Ave. and La Bocca would fit the bill nicely.  We split bruschetta and a pizza, both were outstanding.  The bruschetta selections were as follows:  caprese with fresh pulled mozzarella - very nice.  roasted tomato, pesto & parm - also very nice with a robust pesto.  queen creek olives & ricotta - love the olives!  and the standout - prosciutto, fig & mascarpone - wonderful!  I first had the combo of fig and prosciutto at a reception in Berkeley and loved it then.    We had the porco pizza.  Another interesting combination with pulled pork, serrano chili's and other good stuff.  The thin roasted crust at La Bocca is a hit with me!  The service was good but I did get a sense the server wanted to be somewhere else.  Oh well.  Overall a solid experience and I will be back.  They did have a terrible time keeping up with the food at the Yelp event to the point that I was actually waiting with others by the kitchen door to try and nab some food before it was gone.",

I sat at the bar and the bartender, Julie, was very helpful in making food selections and picking out a wine that went with what I ordered.    The goat cheese mushroom truffle pizza was  good and had a healthy dose of fresh spinach on top, making me not miss a salad with my meal.   The goat cheese on the pizza was really creamy and delish and they didn't skimp on it.  The crust was a little thick for me since I'm from the East Coast, but overall, the pizza was still good  (and it passed the \"can I eat this cold for breakfast?\" test).     Another note -- Tuesday is 1/2 bottle of wine night so if you are planning on ordering a couple glasses of wine, it works out to be less expensive to get a bottle.    Who can't like a restaurant that offers specials like that?",

The Bruschetta here Was AAAMMMAAAAAZZIIIING!!! (see pics) They have 6 toppings and you get to choose 4.  I chose the Roasted Artichoke, Caprese, Salami  Pesto and the Prosciutto, Fig & Truffled Marscapone...........Let me tell you the salami one I didn't care for the other were very good But Next Time I will Order ALL Prosciutto...UNBELIEVABLE right down to the Chewy toasted bread.  I will be dreaming about it from now on I guarantee it!  I also couldn't not resist anything with Mushroom and ordered the Truffled Harvest Mushroom Pizza (see pics) It had harvest mushrooms, melted tomatoes, goat cheese, baby spinach, white truffle oil.......WHOA! Scrumdiddlyumptious!  I could have easily eaten the whole damn thing, but was nice enough to share a couple slices with my friend who only ordered ....\"a salad\"  One more thing that sounded really good was the Turkey & Brie sandwich (see pics) it had oven roasted organic turkey, brie, fig, apple, lettuce, tomato, ciabatta. Accompanied by your choice of seasonal couscous, house-made coleslaw or seasoned potato chips. I chose the cous cous.  Compared to the other mouthwatering delights this sandwich really fell short ,neither my daughter or I really cared for it ......the bread was not even up to par with the other breads we tasted and the turkey was a bit dry.  However the Cous Cous Was Fantastic!!! I would love to have ordered just some of that.  I will go back for sure.  I've never been to Postino so I cant make the comparison like some of the others and I thoroughly enjoyed it so who cares anyway!",

    "text": "Before I get to review La Bocca, I need to deal with legal \"fine print\".  It's called \"fine print\" because it will make everything \"fine\" if you handle it correctly (you'll just have to trust me on this...I am a highly trained \"businessman\"). The \"fine print\" disclaimer for this review follows: The Beautiful Carin is the sister of Peter, one of the managers of La Bocca. As such, I receive (and, hopefully will continue to receive, as long as we both shall live...it's in our marriage vows:), \"special treatment\" at La Bocca. That \"special treatment\" includes: Great Service; Great Food; Great Conversation; Great Atmosphere...hang on...Peter says La Bocca treats everybody that way...crap, I thought I was \"special\". OK, weasel words out of the way, on to the review.  The Beautiful Carin and I wanted to go back to La Bocca for dinner and last night was the night! The beautiful Carin's brother, the Cordial and Talented Restaurateur, Peter greeted us with a welcoming hug (he may or may not do that for you...you'll just have to marry one of his sisters yourself and see), and we sat down. The joint was jumpin'... Friday evening in downtown Tempe always seems to have lot going on.  We had Matt as our server and he was friendly and attentive, got us drinks and some outstanding warm olives and crusty Italian bread...I could have made a meal of that alone! I didn't...I needed to build up calories for my work out this morning. Last night, I hadn't eaten anything since the  1/2 chicken and waffle at Lolo's for lunch...I was famished:) We ordered bruschetta...they have a very nice selection ranging from standard tomato/mozzarella to minced Queen Creek olives on ricotta. We had had a couple of these at the OYE last Sunday evening and they were good then and they were good last night! We had a little time as we enjoyed our wine and appetizers and sort of surveyed the room.  I was really pretty interested in whether we were getting the friends and family treatment or whether our experience was pretty typical...It seemed like the typical experience. Matt was handling 3-5 other tables, at the same time as ours, and they were all smiling and happy. It was the same story throughout the place...everybody looked like they were having a good time:) Our salads arrived...Carin had the Caprese and I had a Caesar...here's where I figured I was getting the \"insider\" deal. I like anchovies (I know, go figure:) and Matt asked the kitchen to put some on my salad, since they don't generally do that. I whispered my \"thanks\" to him, because I didn't want the other diners to become agitated that I was getting something they could never hope to get...but Matt said in a loud voice, \"no, anyone who wants anchovies can have them\"...another perk, dashed! We ordered 2 pizza's...the Porko (pulled pork, caramelized onions and serrano peppers...tasty and spicy) and the meat something (I don't always remember the names, but 3 meats, olives and I added serrano's to that one...yum:) Nicely done pizza's...hot and gooey cheese, fresh and high quality toppings, crispy with a just a little blackening around the edges. Plenty to eat and we had leftovers to take home! Finally, we did dessert at La Bocca last night (last time I was here, my \"offsite\" dessert experience, while memorable, was less than a complete success:) They make a chocolate brownie with liquid chocolate/espresso center. They put ice cream on top and drizzle it with caramel...and crack, apparently.  I was just going to have a bite...I hoovered this thing down so fast I think I embarrassed my sweet beautiful and indulgent wife (who did manage to get a bite or 2 of the dessert, but not much more). In spite of the spoon and napkins, I still looked like a 2 year old with his first soft serve chocolate ice cream cone. So, what's the upshot...Peter, I hate to say it, but even if you never work another day at La Bocca, I'm going back...often.  In the meantime, I expect some special treatment the next time I go in!  If you want special treatment, you need to go find one of Peters other marriageable sisters (he has 14 of them) and get yourself in the family...or just go in to La Bocca and tell them I sent you:) And give Peter a hug...he enjoys it...trust me;)",

    "text": "Great pizza, with an ingredient list that is actually fairly unique.  This is also a place to go for build-your-own, if you're into that kind of thing.  I like to experience the chef's creations, so I order from the menu.  Last night I sampled (like I'm going to tell you how much I ate!!) both the truffled mushroom pizza and the bocca trio.  The mushroom pizza was nearly overwhelmed by the spinach, but the truffle oil and the goat cheese managed to shine despite the subtle flavor of each.  I personally believe mushrooms don't taste like anything, they just are, so I can't comment on their quality.  The other pizza, the Bocca Trio, is a bit like a good old-fashioned meat-lovers' pizza from Pizza Hut in that it has three different meats on it.  There the similarities end; the menu name-drops Genoa and Schreiner's as the source of the salami and sausage, respectively, not deigning to attach any adjectives to the pepperoni.  The whole package works fairly well, with the olives and the cheeses and the tomatoes and everything.  One thing I did notice in going back and forth between the two was that there was a quite marked difference in done-ness.  The crust of the Trio was quite charred, while the other pizza had no black at all.  I'm not sure if this was intentional (I thought it was the styles worked for each pizza) or a side-effect of the enormous rush on the kitchen.  I love La Bocca for offering to hold large events, but if the kitchen and staff can't handle the rush, perhaps we need to look elsewhere.    The pizza size seems a bit smaller than elsewhere - I would recommend a hungry couple split three or try a generous bruschetta plate to take the edge off.  For the sweet-toothed, I also sampled a pizza cookie, on which I can't pass judgement, and a very creamy portion of the tiramisu, which I found to be fantastic.    In the end, this place misses out on the fifth star because of the service I've had on two visits.  Granted, no small or even medium-sized restaurant would not be overwhelmed by the groups I was part of, but La Bocca seems to be over-promising, biting off more than they can chew.  The wait staff tries hard, they really do, but the kitchen simply takes too long to get stuff out the door.  I might add the fifth star back if I get a chance to check this place out on a date night when it's more normal.  I think the pieces are certainly all there - I love the vibe of this place.",

    "text": "I've tried different pizzeria/wine bars in the last year including Serious Pie in Seattle so I'm always looking for a new, interesting experience. I happened to be on Mill for a movie at Valley Art and decided to step in. Although the atmosphere/decor is very nice and modern, the service left much to be desired. When we first walked in, there was some type of confab going on between the hostess and the owners/managers?  It took a few minutes for the hostess to acknowledge us and the managers didn't even say hi or smile even though we were standing right by them. Kind of weird to see that happen because so many other places seem more welcoming. The waiter was nice but seemed distracted, didn't really bother to explain the menu or offer any info on their menu items/specialties. Not sure if he was rushed or covering many tables but it didn't seem so to me. The pizza here was ok, how do you mess up a margarita pizza? Crust was good. We also had the caprese salad and it was ok. No flavor though. I'll try one more time and will try the bruschetta next time. I planned to have a get together with some classmates but I'm seriously thinking a different spot like Postino's East might be a better option.",

    "text": "Wow, this place has been open for just a month and I am the sixth review.  At first I was disappointed with the service, it was a little slow, but it turns out that we got there right before the next shift started.  Our server was very knowledgeable about wines and helped me make a great choice -- I concur with Natalie the pour was generous.  As we were getting ready to leave Bruno, chef and owner came by to talk to us.  He was very friendly (like his staff) and I can't wait for the next visit when I am in the area again.",

    "text": "I just wrapped up a nice evening at La Bocca - on my own, because of a business trip, and despite my solitary visit - I've been won over to make a point of visiting again.  Let me cut to the chase: The ambiance is warm and inviting. The menu is diverse and delicious! The staff is on their game. The happy hour is excellent!  Details: I went during the tail end of happy hour (good from opening at 11am to 6:30pm) and started with a glass of Olaia Tempranillo Blend, Spain 2005 - normally $9 a glass but 1/2 off because of happy hour.  I love tempranillos and this did not disappoint: very smooth and delicious through and through.  I decided to try the $12 bruschetta plank as it was hard to pass up with all of the options.  You choose 4 of the 8 options (or I suppose you can go all in with a single selection).  I chose: salami & house made pesto roasted garlic, goat cheese, balsamic arugula mozz, basil, roma tomato, olive oil, balsamic prosciutto, fig, mascarpone, truffle oil They were all phenomenal in their own way, there could have been a little more arugula and prosciutto on their respective samples - but let me say this about the pairing with my wines.  (I ordered a glass of Poggio Vignoso Chianti, Tuscany 2007 that's normally $7 but again 1/2 off thanks to happy hour).   The Tempranillo followed the goat cheese very well but was superb with the caprese style bruschetta.  I almost couldn't go on to the next selection because the pairing was so amazing.  The aftertaste and revisited splash of wine had a never ending appeal.  A wild outcome was derived from following the prosciutto bruschetta with the Tempranillo.  It was as if I had savored a fantastic creme brule with a blanketing of earthy meatiness thanks to the prosciutto. The younger Chianti also matched very well with the prosciutto bruschetta and finished with magnificence after a bite of the bruschetta with goat cheese, arugula and roasted garlic.  That roasted garlic was the key, so should you visit and order the same, eat around the roasted garlic, saving a nice portion to match up with your wine.  It was nice to see such a wide range of wines offered on their menu (even better to see the glasses 1/2 off during happy hour).  The whites are diverse enough and the reds range from a number of CA wines (Cab, Merlot, Zin), to the single Italian, a pair of Tempranillos and a pair of Malbecs in addition to a Pinot and Shiraz from down under.  It would be great to see a Carmenere in addition to some more Italians.  I know they serve desserts, but I didn't indulge beyond a cup of coffee.  I'd say as a finishing touch, change over to the smooth yet robust Illy coffee and from start to finish the bill of fare would be top notch.",

    "text": "Came back to La Bocca last night. The only other time I've been here was  for the Yelp Elite event last Sunday, but after that experience, we knew we'd be back. We told the hostess we were just here for dessert and she sat us at a great cozy table for 2 in one of the corners of the restaurant, which was pretty busy. Our server was really friendly and immediately got our drinks and put in our order for the OMG. Our dessert came out in no time and it was DELICIOUS. ice cream, and melted chocolate with espresso. It was like a gooey brownie. We saw the server who waited on us during the Elite event last Sunday and he said hi. Everyone here is so friendly and attentive. Our server and one of the owners both waited on us. They have relaxed happy hour specials from 11-6:30 pm and live music on Thursdays so we'll be back.",

    "text": "Woohoo is right. My hubby and I have gone a few times for happy hour and always enjoyed ourselves. Last night was the best so far. We were enjoying a few Left Hands and ordered the Tuesday night pizza special. It was 2 for 1 basically so we each ordered our fave. Apparently the GM thought my pizza was too done so he brought out the \" burnt\" one and already had another one cooking. I actually like my pizza that way but hey, I could understand where he was coming from. The second pizza was beautiful, a work of art. My husband's pie was great, all he kept saying was how great the crust was. I wil definitely bring all my friends and clients here. Special service too!  thanks again to Dan the general manager and our delicious server Reina ( sorry there isn't a better word,is there?)            Linda and Ron",

    "text": "This review is for La Bocca's happy hour. My sister was in town, and my husband and I decided it would be fun to go to Mill Avenue and stop by a few places for a drink and an appetizer. La Bocca was our first stop. We sat down at the bar around 6:50 pm (happy hour there ends at 7), and we were thrilled to make it in just in time for happy hour prices (half off of all wine, beer, and mixed drinks). However, even though there was only one other person sitting at the bar and the restaurant itself wasn't super-full, it took our bartender a good 7 minutes or so to even acknowledge that we were there. Even if he were actually busy (which it didn't seem that he was), is it too much to ask that he acknowledge us with a nod or a simple \"I'll be right with you\"? Ugh, that's one of my biggest service pet peeves. By the time he finally came over to us, it was 6:58. We asked if we were still in time for happy hour prices, which he said we were, although he sounded a little peeved that we even asked. Perhaps that's why he took so long to come over?  Anyway, we ordered 3 vodka drinks and the bruschetta sampler (pick 4 toppings from 6 choices for $12). We chose: 1) prosciutto/fig/marscapone; 2) sundried tomato/goat cheese; 3) tomato pesto; and the 4) roasted artichoke. On the positive side, the drinks were mixed quite well and came fairly quickly. The bruschetta was definitely satisfying, but nothing spectacular. The standout flavor was by far the proscittuo/fig/marscapone. The other 3 (vegetarian) were overly salty and/or oily. Additionally, the bread was not nearly crispy enough. The bruschetta sampler was definitely better  and more thoughtfully presented than your average appetizer, but I'm going to hold out for the original dish of this kind at Postino, since I hear that's unbeatable. This one was just ok.   We liked La Bocca's airy, bright, and urban atmosphere, and the drinks were good, especially for half-off, but the service and food left something to be desired. As a few reviewers have already said, they really should discount at least one or two appetizers for happy hour.",

    "text": "I had the opportunity to visit La Bocca a second time, on Friday the first night of Tempe's Fall Frenzy concert weekend. It was well past 8pm and very busy but my friend and I got a table on the patio immediately. Our  waiter was attentive and charming without being obnoxious. My cool iced Prickly Pear margarita was exactly what I needed  after the walk from Rio Salado. Once again,I went for the bruschetta plank but with different choices and again it was heavenly. Lisa and I agree our favorite is the marscapone with fig and smoked prosciutto. We hung out enjoyed the food, music, people watching , a few different margaritas,my favorite being the Pomegranate. Later we  hit the Music concert with full bellies and happy minds :)",

    "text": "This is a great spot to take girls out to because It is not expensive compared to similar establishments in Scottsdale. I've been here a few times and the service is always impecable and I've never had any complaints in that area. I will say that around dinner time on weekdays and more so on the weekend it can get pretty crowded and the inside sections will fill up fast and you may be forced to sit on the patio, so you might think about making a reservation. The menu is simple and I usually order just a  pepperoni pizza with a side of marinara sauce.  The only complaints are that the menue is very limited there sauce is pre-made (asked them to take out mushrooms and they couldn't). Otherwise this place has amazing pizza, pastas, and salads for no more then $15 and if you want to get crazy try some of there sangria it's delicious. I like that while this place feels very elegant it is cozy and welcoming and I would feel comfortable walking into this place wearing sandals and a tee.",

I had the truffled mushroom pizza which is sauteed mushrooms, roasted tomatoes, goat cheese, mozzarella, fresh spinach lightly tossed in balsamic vinaigrette and a little white truffle oil for good measure.  It was really really good!  I know that one time I tried their white sangria which is also really good.  Next time I visit La Bocca will have to try their sandwiches... they looked awesome also:)",

The pizzas are a little too thin and soft for hands, but the crust is delicious (better than some pizza I had in italy!)  Had one weird experience recently where the Brussels sprouts on our pizza were not cooked at all -- tasted like blocks of salad or raw cabbage on a bit of crust. I'd had this one before, they had been cooked then, and were delicious. This last time, not so much.",

    "text": "Just returned from hopefully my last ever visit to La Bocca.  Let me describe the experience.  Arrive and am seated outside.  It's lovely out, so, that is a bonus.  I sit down to filthy, paper menu.  Not so good.  Then I pickup my silverware wrap off my bread plate and it is dirty.  The waitress asks me for my drink order and I ask for sweetner with my tea.  She brings my tea and 2 packages of sugar.  I tell her I don't want sugar and she gives me some snide remark about it being the only thing they have and \"it is all natural.\"  All I wanted was some lousy Sweet'N Low.  Never got any bread and waitress never noticed that I moved the dirty plate to the side of the table to get it replaced.  Oh well!  Next I order a salmon caesar salad.  It arrives and the salmon is dry and flavorless.  I'm done.  The best part about the meal was company.  I won't go there again.  I continue to wonder how they stay in business??????",
