I got here around 8:45 or so on a Friday night and it was pretty dead, a few people here and there at the bar but pretty empty.  The bartender and patrons were friendly though so I didn't mind.  My friends showed up a little bit later and we got a table so that we could have a good view of the band once they started playing.  Once it got closer to 9:30-ish it started getting busier and before I knew it the place was full and I had to squeeze through couples to get to the bathroom!  The live bands were awesome and it was nice that the people watching were actually enjoying it and you could tell.  It's always more fun when everyone around you is having a good time!  The best (well, one of the best) part of the night was when I went to close out my tab and found out that it was only $3.50 each for my Vodka Red Bulls!  This fact was extra astounding to me seeing as how a few nights before I had literally spent twice that on the exact same drink at a bar in Scottsdale! (insert Scottsdale joke here...)",

I could write a review on the parking lot alone, but that is for another day.  Anyway, enter the Yucca Tap and go to the right and you will see a depressing, dimly-lit bar.  To the left is a well-lit whiskey/beer bar.  My wife and I visited the Yucca on a random Saturday night at about 8:30ish.  The place wasn't too busy...yet.  We first went to the right.  We each got a beer and had a seat in one of their many booths.  There was a small band on stage.  There were only a handful of people there and most looked like they had been there all day drinking away their sorrows and/or hiding from the law.  The place was pretty depressing.  However, I like cheap drinks, friendly bar tenders and dive bars so I was ok with it.  Not exactly a place to bring your wife though.  Anyway, the other half of the bar (to the left when you enter) is a totally different story.  They have a great selection of beers and sort of reminds me of an older, grittier Taste of Tops.  We sat there for about an hour, sampled some more of their beers then took off.  I will definitely return when I feel the urge for some local dive bar action.  The entire place isn't as bad as it looks, has cheap drinks and everyone seemed pretty friendly.",

They've done a great job with this place.  You could still smell a bit of the varnish from the new bar and walls when I went in, very cleanly done in greens and wood to reflect the three pool tables.  They have a nice selection of taps and a huge selection of bottled beer.  The owner said that they've got local artists bringing in rotating art starting next week.  The liquor selection is a thing of beauty.  Rodney has sought out the best micro-distilled spirits he can find.  He poured us a little sip of the Dry Fly vodka and gin, both amazing, beyond your normal liquor for quality and smoothness.  What I like best about this place is that it isn't trying to hard.  The crowd was still a Yucca crowd, the music was still rock, nothing loungey about it. Though my wallet dies every time I say it, Long Live Yucca.",

    "text": "Yucca Tap Room - been around for years. Back in the day I would only go when a band I really wanted to see was playing. Back in those days I don't think they even HAD any taps LOL. Food was a guy that had a hot dog cart right outside the bar. But hey - it's come a long long way since then. Now I even come to the non-band side where they serve food and craft beers even if I'm NOT planning to see a band. Came with a bunch of coworkers the other day for happy hour. A good time was had by all. They even have one of those Touch Tunes jukeboxes and I took it over for the time we were all there. I had to supress laughter when one of the coworkers claimed \"they play pretty good music here.\" They never figured it out even though every time that someone was wondering out loud what song was playing I just happened to know each time - even if their Shazams couldn't figure it out. The only complaint is the craft beer/food side of the Yucca was a lot hotter than the other side. I'll admit I'm not a big fan of the mall it's in. I usually enter from Mill but now one of the entrances to the mall is blocked off by poles planted into the ground so there is only that one main entrance now. Lots of parking - yeah it's sketchy but further into the night the Yucca is eventually the only business open. Glad this place is still open after Sail Inn, Hollywood Alley, Big Fish Pub, etc have shuttered. Here's to you, Yucca!",

    "text": "Oh Yucky Tap, I hardly know ye!  Checked out the new expansion last night and I have to say I'm quite impressed. They took over some greasy food joint next door and instead of knocking out a wall and openin' 'er up, they simply added two entrances from the existing Yucca bar you know and love (ahem, some of us know and love quite a bit more than others).  So the first entrance is right off the OG entrance, and the second entrance is punched out of the wood paneling wall where the booths stop on that side. Kinda funny since you won't notice it until someone comes through it, and the glowing white light and shiny floor pulls you in like siren song.   However, the cuteness of the hidden door quickly wears off if you happen to be there on a packed night, because it's placement causes a TON of traffic jams and pushing and shoving as people try to go back/forth from expansion to OG bar, and try to make their way from back/front of OG bar, and people trying to watch the band get sick of shuffling around the disaster. They need a light or a stop sign or something, it was just a mess!  But what about the fucking expansion already, right? No complaints there, not a one. I followed that soft glowing light, past three pool tables, two sparkly new (single person) bathrooms and to the bar, I was lead to a refrigerated cooler of \"craft\" beers. Beers in there range from $4 - $9. On tap, they had about 8 beers that included SKA True Blonde, Framboise, etc. I got the SKA and it was $4.25  The service was fast and friendly and I was pretty happy to belly up there and wait for my friends. That's when someone sat down next to me and ordered \"two slices of pizza, with pineapple and olives.\" Um, what? You can order FOOD here? You sure can, my dear bar flys. They have a full kitchen that churns out slices, calzones and sandwiches. Whoa! If you were trying to give Taste of Tops a run, you certainly beat them in the food department.   OK, I'm gonna wrap this up since I have a problem with brevity:  Awesome: Custom wall paper with Yucca's signature guitar logo, records and such; local artist paintings for sale and just for looking at; god, those nice new bathrooms need another mention!  Oh! One last thing. A little birdie told me that the craft bar does not factor into the pay out to the bands that play in the OG bar. Something to consider when you come *specifically to see a cool band for no cover.* They make money off a percent of the bar bill (in this case, the OG bar bill only), so keep that in mind.",

In summary, the Yucca Tap Room is just another dive bar that caters to a mix of locals and hipsters. I never really cared much for this place (probably because a lot of the time I was surrounded by what seemed like the cream of the Tempe music scene's most mediocre crop), but at least there's a place for these types of things.   The bar isn't the greatest--had a night when I got two of the same drink for me and a friend and they tasted entirely different. Came back a few weeks later and pretty much the same thing happened. The prices are pretty good though, so it keeps people coming. Sticky floors, sticky tables, sticky booths...I wouldn't mind these at all, if my friend didn't almost sit on a used hypodermic needle...I agree with Bonnie G's statement: \"Yucky Tap Room\" indeed.

He stated that \"They start whenever they want to, maybe 10:30pm\"! Wow! Really? Having been married to a pro musician for a long time, I was surprised by this. So, dive bar yes, now they have food, didn't try it. But if you are going for the music, go late, maybe they will be playing!  OK, we went back a couple weeks ago because a friend's band was playing. The lineup was good,  we got a booth in the corner, got a beer (had to go to the bar, no waitress) and it was a cool night.

    "text": "So, I frequented Yucca tap on my Saturday Dive Bar Tour and I have a sneaking suspicion it would be quite different if I stumbled in on a Saturday evening rather than around 2pm.  This suspicion is due to a combination of hearsay from friends, other reviews, and walking past the front doors to grab some Shisha from the neighboring smoke shop around 10pm.  For that last scenario, there was not one time in which I felt confident I would NOT be smacked in the head by a stray beer bottle.  I love the live music, there are so few places in Tempe where you can see some rock and roll without having to fork out $20 and know every lyric.  That's why even though I haven't had the pleasure of rocking out to some live music here myself, I'm reviewing high in anticipation and Yucca will have to mess it up to get an updated, lower review.  The place is really pretty small during the day, and dark as all hell.  I had trouble seeing when I first walked in.  The bartender was pretty cool, and prices were cheap - so cheap that when Chris R. asked about whether there were any specials going on, the bartender just replied 'no specials, we just sell everything cheap.'

They have a happy hour, but it is not needed due to the very reasonable prices on a normal night. Ex. I ordered a Captain and coke, and the lady asked me if I wanted a tall or a short. I ordered a tall and that was 5 bucks. Now you might ask, how much rum can there be in a $5 cptncoke, and I claim 'enough'. This impressed me so much that I stayed for another one.   The other part of the bar have craft beers and I need to check that out on my next visit, because there will be a next visit for sure.

    "text": "We planned a vacation to the southwest, and when we found out that one of our very favorite bands was doing a residency here (Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers) we knew we had to get our tickets and arrange our itinerary to go to the show.   Hands down, one of the best decisions ever.  First of all... RCPM is an amazing band. We have never seen them live before and this 20th anniversary show of their first album was a really great event.   Second... Small, local \"dive\" feel in a college town, the bar is extensive, the staff amazingly helpful and probably some of the most hard working people I've ever seen. Didn't like that that the path from the kitchen to the dining room next door saw the poor guys having to go outside to get things over to the dining area. A bit of a redesign in knocking out the last booth against the wall by the door to the patio would make a huge difference for the staff. I felt bad for them.  Drinks were cold. Tequila was flowing (Mexican Moonshine by Roger Clyne) and the service speedy with so many people in the place. Sound system was great, so many times a place like this may sound muddy.   But this was outstanding as an experience. Looks like if you love live music and drinking and dancing in front of the stage... this is the place for you.   \"Here's to life,\" as Roger would sing.",

Love the craft beer fridges and taps on the new side as well.

I think her name was summer or something similar.I work in customer service and it pisses me off when people can't be polite, not act like a brat and treat me with respect. She heard the drink I ordered and just mumbled something and walked away, I figured she was a bar back and had to grab the other chick to help out but she just walked outside to smoke. Then when I was outside enjoying my own cigarette she was hanging with her friends on the job drinking booze out of the trunk of a car. I hope this chick goes, sorry about my rant I'm just surprised this happened. The rest of the staff is outstanding especially that chick Amanda. Thanks yucca for being a great dive option.",

Doesn't matter to me though, usually the best bars aren't in the greatest places and they had a ton of security. Seemed like women wouldn't frequent here though.

Oh and third most critical point: the friendliest bartenders I've ever met work here,   Ok now the real review. You will give this place five stars if any of the following describes you: *you are a hipster *you enjoy motorcycles *you enjoy small bands live *you enjoy a good deal, regardless of atmosphere *portions matter more than the product served *you are looking for fernet (caution, the mix is strong) *service matters to you  Now who would give it three stars? *People looking for the hip bar, this place is not very crowded *People looking for trendy or original mixed drinks *People looking for smaller portions with less grease *People looking for great food (it's good for a bar, but besides the portions, unremarkable)  All in all I had a solid experience and I will be back.

Either that or my definition of a dive bar involves more hobos and dilapidated captain's chairs with the not so faint smell of old cigarette smoke and moldy wood paneling.   At any rate...the beer selection is GREAT.  As an almost exclusive imbiber of the IPA , it was pretty great having several good beers to choose from.  And the kimchi bulgogi fries were stupendous.  Stupidly delicious.  My Korean mom is probably shaking her fist at the mere thought of the gluttonous, fatassery of a huge plate of fries covered in meat and kimchi.  You can also choose to get tots over fries.  Why I didn't notice that before I placed my order...I'll just have to live with myself until next time.  I would totally come back here, maybe next time I'll come at an hour where there are other patrons.  I bet this place gets a lot of cool people milling about.",

What's not to love about a bar that looks like it's been untouched since 1972? There's live music, the bartenders are great, and the crowd's an unlikely mix of college hipsters and people who look like they haven't left since 1972. If you've ever wanted grizzled regulars to stare at you wordlessly and nod while a punk band plays, Yucca Classic is your place. It's surreal. If you haven't stopped in for a while, they even have draft beer now! (Oooh, ahhh.)  Second, there's the shinier, newer \"craft\" side, stocked with damn near any beer you could want (can! bottle! draft!), as well as a shockingly full spirits selection. It's got a different vibe, which I frankly find disturbingly sterile, but it also has 20-30 beers and ciders on tap at any given moment. Suck on that, other bars!  There's a surprisingly adequate kitchen serving both bars with a variety of reasonably-priced options for hangry alcoholics. The street tacos exceed my needs for bar food, and Yucca does mercifully celebrate the international holiday known as Taco Tuesday. Proving that Yucca respects no labels, the menu also sports a handful of Korean fusion options. Because what wood-paneled college town dive bar doesn't have bulgogi and kimchi?  If you're looking for a dive, try this one on for size. Just maybe not on a weekend when it's full of 21-year-old ASU kids.",

The crowd reminds me of a mix of typical musicians and artists, as well as people who were probably teenagers attending the Warped Tour a decade or so ago. My favorite part of this bar is the live music, and that's exactly why we go.  I can guarantee that on a Friday or Saturday night, there will be some bands playing and people rocking out here. The bartenders are really quick and they usually have some great craft beers rotating on draft. The Tap Room also has plenty of liquor options and they're prepared to cook bar food late into the night. The people I run into here are always pretty nice, and this is a bar I could see myself frequenting. The prices are also super reasonable for Tempe, especially at happy hour.   I would recommend Yucca Tap Room to anyone who likes live music and doesn't mind a divey/grunge feel. Personally, I prefer it at times.",

This place is awesome to check out up and coming and locals bands or local artists (painting and artwork available for purchase on the walls). Always changing themes, again the senior staff makes this place feel like a home away from home.  Bring back the falafel!",

While many bars aim to boast the LARGEST beer selection, Yucca keeps it cool, with a nice ratio of staples like PBR and Red Stripe for $3 to obscure drafts for as low as $6. Many of them come in 10-12 oz. glasses, and that's so they don't completely kick your ass. I had:  Deschutes Hop Henge Experimental IPA (8.5% ABV) Mission Shipwrecked Double IPA (9.3%) And some other ale from Goose Island Brewery I was too buzzed to bother noting details on.   Also, the liquor selection. Just do it.  You don't even have to drink to enjoy this place. There's a good bar menu, a Foosball table, pool, some casino game I don't recognize, and A WHOLE OTHER BAR FOR MORE LIQUOR AND LIVE MUSIC. And they don't even charge a cover.  Just writing this review makes me wanna race out there right now, and it takes a lot to get this excited about a dive.",

The other side of the building has a large bar and area for a band to play.  Yucca supports local bands so if you venture here to get a drink, know that you'll most likely happen upon a scene that involves loud music, lots of smoking, and hipsters in every corner. It's a young crowd that gets actively involved in the music playing.  But hey, wtih $2 PBRs, you can't beat the entertainment. Try it out!",

    "text": "\"Unpretentious\" is the word that comes to mind when I think of Yucca Tap Room.  There's almost a refreshing quality to this stripped down dive bar--it's the polar opposite of places you'll find in Scottsdale [sigh of relief].   The bartenders are genuine and there's always live music to keep things interesting.  I love it because there's no cover.  Ever.  Plus, diverse musical talents bring equally unique people.    The setup of the place is simple yet deliberate, with two separate \"environments\" to choose from (for lack of any other way to describe it).   There's a conventional 360-degree bar with stools lining the perimeter--the stage is on this side, making this the louder side of the place.  Thank goodness for the hooks lining the underside of the bar; this is the kind of place where you don't want your purse sitting on the ground.  There's a shuffle board on this side, and the door to the \"patio.\"  By \"patio\", I mean a fenced-in strip of sidewalk along Southern Avenue where smokers can socialize.    On the other side of the place there's another bar, backed with an expansive selection of bottled brews.  Yes, variety is what Yucca does best.  This side has a couple pool tables and some more seating.  Ladies, I highly recommend using the restroom on this side of the place.   Don't be turned off by the first band that plays; the less talented musicians tend to play first.  Like any bar, it always gets more interesting as the night progresses.",

Sunday was Cowboy/Western music/theme but without the actual cowboys so it ended up being a lot of great un-western (less intimidating than the real thing) people swinging around on the dance floor :)  Everyone there seems to be down to have a good time and dance no matter the type of music/theme/crowd.  Fantastic.   It is a great dive in Tempe and within walking distance from Time Out Lounge and Monkey Pants (two other GREAT bars).  So easy to do a little circuit comprised of the Tempe dive bar trifecta!   It always seems to be perfectly crowded... never dead and never 45min to get a drink...you will find a seat at the bar or a nearby booth but you have to do a bit of legwork.    The only complaint I have was that my martini extra dirty was too dirty.  It was quite green in fact.... and although it was drinkable it wasn't necessarily enjoyable.    *Its right on Southern and Mill but you got to overshoot the bar quite a bit and continue W on Southern before turning into the parking area*",

There was a couple of places open next to the Yucca: a smoke shop that carried a small selection of cigars and lots of head shop stuff, a pool hall of sorts, and then the Yucca itself.   It is a small venue, but does have a large bar for seating, and lots of room to stand.  We came early and sat at the bar.  The bartenders are great.  Friendly enough and take pretty good care of you.  They sell chips/pretzels and we saw pizza slices come from next door.  There are also televisions at the bar so you can watch the game as you listen to the bands.  There is a small outdoor smoking area out the back, and I do mean small.  I thought the live music was going to be overpowering in such a small space, but it was great.  The people were friendly,too, moving out of your way to get past to the bathroom, etc.  A dive bar we would go back to.",

Drink prices are reasonable, especially during the day.   The owner has recently doubled the size of the bar, offering the traditional honky tonk one one side, and a fine ale and whiskey bar on the other.   The Yucca now accepts credit cards for the first time since forever, which is a convenience most people take for granted these days.   There is live music every night, some touring acts, some local acts, and some regular gigs that draw in locals.   I've heard this bar referred to as \"rough\" or \"tough\" or \"rowdy\", and while that hasn't been my experience, what do you really expect from a place with this much character and everlasting style. This is the type of bar that separates the men from the boys, the alcoholics from the drunks, and coherent from the incoherent.   The parking is in the back ,like any respectable dive bar should be, and the good ole boys that drink there during the day are a fine bunch a fellas.  I like their deep contempt for the youngsters that wreck the place every night.  But every night, those young and hip crowds create a culture that is Truely Tempe--  Good and bad, and that ain't bad.",

It was a dive bar, of course, the staff was extremely friendly, but there was just a really weird smell that I couldn't ignore which is why I'm giving it the four stars. There was a bit of an older crowd. They also should probably have some more seating. Most importantly, my beer was yummy and cold! Probably won't be going back though, not my type of place.",

    "text": "I've always had a good experience here until today. I had my service dog with me today and since there were no outside tables I brought him inside. I could hear the bartender Amanda and another woman, perhaps another bartender or manager, talking about him, so I took it upon myself to get out his paperwork to show them (mind you, I'm not legally obligated to do that) and the manager yelled at the bartender that \"if it doesn't have xyz it's not legitimate!\" I asked her to repeat that, but instead she just walked away. I showed the bartender my ESA paperwork, to which she responded with a shrug and a very sarcastic \"ok\". I then asked for some menus and got a very short and terse reply as she tossed the menus on the bar.   As we were trying to pay our bill, we tried to use a coupon off of Yelp for half off our drinks since we asked to have separate drink tabs but to split the sliders between the two checks. She gave us a hard time saying she couldn't do that, so she split the check equally and told my friend \"it's only 9 dollars (each)...\".   I'm in the service industry, and I ALWAYS tip. I couldn't bring myself to today because of the attitude we were given by the staff. I've been here before numerous times and had a great time, and was showing my friend from out of town around, and now I regret it. I won't be back, and will be sure to tell others to stay away.",

It is more of a traditional dive bar and has the major label beers (plus some of the forgotten brews that are more nostalgic now such as Hamm's & PBR). I was impressed that I checked in and received a Yelp coupon for 50% off of my first drink. I had a tall Red Stripe, a Hamm's, and a PBR for a grand total of $6.   Next door, or through the door in inside the bar, is a second version of the bar. This has a whole different feel. It is more of a craft beer, newer bar. Unlike the chalk board menu next door, this section of the bar has electronic menus with a good assortment of micro-brews. Each of the ones I had on this side were $6 each.   A huge highlight for me was the menu. I ordered a Sonoran hot dog for $3.95. Being engaged to a lady from Sonora I have had several from various places. The Sonoran hot dog here was probably the best I have ever had. And it was cheap!   I like this place because it does have two different personalities and depending on your mood, one of them will be right for you. I like the newer side with a good selection of draughts and bottles. Not to mention the hot dog!",

Too bad we didn't see the 3rd red head who walked by us as we all agreed to take it on the 3rd one that walks by. :(  I've been eyeing this place for the longest time since I've been seeing my two friends from Arizona checking into this place. Finally got to try it out and....  I only liked the drinks, atmosphere and the pool table. Totally did NOT like the food that night. On their menu, there is a bar snacks and entree section. I decided to eat something small since I know I cannot finish a burger or a taco by myself, so I got the chicken and beef kabobs. Some of you should know how a kabobs look like right? If you don't, they look like this <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fyieatn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2011%2F06%2Fkabobs-719954.jpg&s=48ad12addb33a42e6552e028c31e49a771edb2a22d2fc5b2def682ddc91de974\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">yieatn.com/wp-content/up...</a> and what yucca gave me was only meat and no veggies. Disappointed...I wished they at least listed on the menu somewhere 'just meat' When I got the kabobs, my chicken tasted fine, but my beef tasted like it got dipped into salt at least 5x... Ugh. I hope the food only tasted that yucks because of not having enough people in the kitchen. I mean... if you're going to serve bar snacks, it shouldn't take 40-50 mins. Gah....  Pool table entertained us the most throughout the night. $1 quarters a game. Plus there's a live band in the other room if you're interested in listening. By the way, there's also another bar in the same room where the band places but only a couple of tables to sit down.   maybe it's a bad night that we went...I guess we'll have to find out the next time I visit! Until then...this place was OKAY.",

They have a cool screen that displays all their beers on tap, which is about 30.  I tried the Nitro Milk Stout by Lefthand Brewing Co and it is seriously the best, most creamy and delicious stout I've ever had.  So good that my babe bought me a second one while I let him hit on me like we were strangers.

The beer is also extremely cheap and the live music kicks ass. I recommend heading out on a Thursday when the bar hosts Rock Karaoke. People are invited to sing along with a backing band (the Valley's Zen Lunatics). You'll hear everyone covering The Doors to The Rolling Stones to The Go Gos. And more often than not, this turns into a show of local musicians performing covers. Watch out for Nate Ruess, the lead singer of Valley pop-rockers The Format. His Beatles covers are killer.",

Tuesday evenings a great house band called Chocolate Fountain will keep you grooving!  Great local bands take turns filling the stage through out the rest of the week and weekend.  Venus is one of the nicest bartenders in the valley and she will pour you an honest drink as will all the staff behind this bar.  Oh yeah bar shuffleboard on hand for the sporty types.",

I appreciate that its a rare, live music bar room, which is strikingly rare in this town for some reason, but if you aren't going to check out a band bang their way through Tom Petty covers, than I cannot really fathom a reason to check it out.  That said, there ARE times when you want exactly this, and Yucca Tap Room provides that valley void.  Prices are so cheap its silly and the regs are generally spirited and friendly to non-regs.",

Which is nice since in the city limits of Tempe it seems to be the thing to do.... and at 42 it gets a little embarrassing to be pulling a photo of myself from back in 1995 out of my wallet. So the bouncer gets points for common sense. No cover charge and four bands tonight. It was a young crowd but not annoying more laid back. I found a seat at the bar (score.) The bar tenders were busy but nice and everyone seemed to be in a good mood... but that could have been the sea of Pabst Blue Ribbon (I think I was the only person there not holding a can.) I almost felt as if I were in a PBR commercial. There were some cute young men that seemed very smart with their earplugs. My ears are still ringing as I write this. I went to see Source Victoria and they rocked the house. I didn't drink anything so I didn't visit the restroom but since the ladies is next to the stage I did get a nice view as the girls ran in and out... it looked fine. So despite not drinking and staying up way past my bedtime I still enjoyed myself and for a \"dive\" bar I felt pretty safe going there. Parking is ample, people are nice, free to get in, easy access to the freeway to zip back downtown. Not bad for a Saturday night.",

No Bud for me, I like beer with flavor. I couldn't wait to get a nice cold freshly poured draught. So, you can imagine my dismay when I sat down and looked for the tap handles displaying my favorite brews. There are none. NONE, zip, zero, zilch. Then as I asked for some of my favorites, I was even more dismayed and ended up with a Beam on the Rocks. or 4. hehe. I was walking, why not, ha. It wasn't a total waste, I did get spanked by a German Mexican chick who likes her toes sucked. I mean, thats worth no Taps, right? I've only been back once on a Thursday for the Live Karoake and it was pretty rockin. They had Sierra Nevada(were out the first time)and I was easily satisfied even without it coming thru a tap. It's a close second to the king of dives, PV.",

Interesting Characters of the past and present can be seen on a barstool across the room. There's an adjacent Room filled with arcade games and pinball machines. It's a True gem.

They have one of the best craft beer selections for being such a dive. They also have a lot of tap takeover nights which is pretty cool too!   I normally would just drink here, but came on a tuesday and saw they had $1 tacos, was kind of skeptical but tried them anyway. AND HOLY MOLY they were delicious. Since then i've tried other things on their menu, and have not been disappointed. The other night I had the veggie burger, and for a bar you would expect just some store-bought frozen patty, but not at yucca! They homemake them with black beans and cranberries and let me tell you, IT WAS SO GOOD. They were very generous with all the fixings too, (including lots of avocado) which i've seen places be stingy with. Also the prices are so reasonable, and they have specials on top of their great prices such as taco tuesday, wing wednesday and NFL specials.  Lastly, if the beer and food don't win you over, they have live music too! And there's rarely a cover. It's a great place to discover some cool local music and traveling bands too.   So overall, if you haven't been this this place. I would highly recommend.  I'm sure you'll love this place just as much as I do.",

We worked together at Mann Theaters and would always get off late and head over to his house to have a few beers, shoot some pool and just chill.  During the Summer of 97, we pretty much had Less Than Jakes \"Losing Streak\" CD on repeat.  There wasn't a day that went by that Losing Streak was not played in its entirety..most often, multiple times in a row.  To this day, its still one of my favorite albums of all time, and never gets old.  By now, you are probably asking yourself \"What the fuck does this have to do with Yucca Tap Room?\".  I'll tell you what it has to do with Yucca Tap Room.....My buddies band (Western Settings... <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fwesternsettings%2F&s=97f66be2501256ba7ceb03e2a82bdf1b65d7e3301a18fe3084ce288874a2c271\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">facebook.com/westernsett...</a>) was playing here with Less Than Jake on Saturday night!  I drove down and parked in the back parking lot (huge..plenty of parking) and made my way up to the venue.  They had some of the back parking lot fenced off with a stage out back for the \"main acts\" of the night.  Inside, there are 2 sections.  One where you can just chill for the most part, then the other section with another stage where bands play.  Inside was a bit tight when people started packing in, but you could still find a little room to stake your claim.  It had a very intimate feel to it seeing is that you are right next to the stage.  The place had mad energy all night, and the sound was great!  My buddies band was fantastic, and I got to see Less Than Jake who I have always wanted to see live!  Less Than Jake played at least 5 songs from Losing Streak and I was bouncing along, singing out loud.  It was great!    I did not partake in any alcohol, but prices seemed fair.  They were selling tall boys for $3.00, and bottles of water for $1.00.  Overall, I had a great time and would definitely come back here to chill and listen to some live music!  It's kind of \"divey\" but in a good way.  All employees, security guards etc were super chill.  Can't wait to come back!",

They added a new room, which is great, it really adds some room and it allows people to go in there and hang out if their not into the band. Also added enough space for some pool tables which is chill. The only thing that sucks is that they don't take credit.  If you're into the dive bar feel, this is a great place to go.",

They do have the naked lady game.... otherwise known as Photo Hunt... the best bar game of all time.  (A note to both ladies and gents, the naked ladies are much less distracting than the naked men... and hair, heels, and bra straps are heavily relied on as the sourced of difference between the image. 5.  It's a good mix of people and pretty cheap.  Unpretentious and awesome! 6.  It's bikeable, but I feel like I've traveled long distances to get there (I think that is because crossing Souther is intimidating)",

    "text": "Alcoholic's Paradise!!!  I must say the first thing that caught my attention at this place was the hours. It opens at 6am and closes at 2am every day! The place also has no windows.  My roommate absolutely loves this place, but I'm not as much of a fan. It's a local hangout for bikers, hipsters, and people that don't appear to fit in with the traditional clientele that a bar has. From time to time, I see a group of young people stroll in, but this is mainly a hangout for people in their 30's and up.  The beer selection is pretty awesome and I think they have one of the best selections in town. The price of some drinks though is really expensive. Be careful what you order, the rarer the beer, the more it will dip into you funds.  They have a strict $10 minimum on all credit card tabs, so if you are only going for a drink you might want to bring cash. The service is ok considering the type of customers they cater to. I'm sure it has more positives and negatives that I have not mentioned, but overall, it's not a bar I would see myself going to.  In sum, it's like that house that sits on the market waiting for the right buyer: Are you ready to make an offer? Not me.",

It's been a stomping ground for many of the better known musicians to come from AZ including Robin from Gin Blossoms (he also used to host their open mic), Jim from Jimmy Eat World and Jason from Authority Zero. It has also expanded like many other Tempe staples in the last few years but thankfully has kept its integrity mostly intact. The drinks are still cheap(ish) and the bartenders keep em coming at a reasonable pace. They have beefed up security a bit (the dude who always wears a bullet proof vest is especially chuckle-inducing) but it's not as obnoxious as some have made it out. The shows that warrant it are still just as aggressive, sloppy and loud as they ever were. And there's a great variety of shows too. I've only had pizza from their kitchen and it wasn't half bad for bar food. I'm tempted to not give this place 5 stars since I couldn't play last night when they were SUPPOSED to have open mic but damn it I just can't.",

This is not the first time we've waited in the parking lot past 6:00 AM for the day shift bartender.

But I just don't have it in me at the moment, this place consumes your enthusiasm for live music, and destroys your sense of security all for the sake of good security. Let's have a drink and or go to jail! With my half hearted review of the Yucca.    The security is a nightmare for patrons and musicians alike. Just outrageous, controlling, trolling, malicious, bored, angry, and ready for confrontation. I love how venue owners are so angry and hurt when they find out that people pay bands to play their living rooms and backyards. It is far safer to have a home event than going to something like this place anymore. If the patrons don't get you, they have trucked in and paid a group of people to control you and if that doesn't work, jail you. It's 9 dollar beer night and you are broke and in jail because somebody got bored! Fun fun fun.     Who cares? I don't anymore. I have defended this venue over and over in the past. But it is a nightmare for everyone involved and without merit or fun anymore. What happened to this place to make it on par with a night in the drunk tank while jailers berate you? Was there some type of crime committed here? Is there reports of wild animals mauling people in the parking lot? Are people so out of control inside on a 6 x 6 stage that they need all that security on a constant basis? Well I guess I don't care. And that is that!  2 stars for the past greatness. Current greatness is N/A.",

This place I have been told has live music sometimes, although the night I stopped by they did not have any live music.  They have lots of domestic beers and some craft beers, along with almost any specialty drink you can think of. And, the best part?? They serve food until midnight.

A beer-bartender, Casey, who knows beer like the back of his own hand. Seriously, pull up to the bar when he's working and he's got stories and flavor profiles for everything available and something as a backup if a tap runs out. And for those who don't care much for fancy beer, they have PBR, Bud, etc. Either selection (craft or not) won't burn a hole in your wallet.  The food addition of Bao Box has upped the food game to Yucca- totally delicious-but-not-fancy bento meal for less than $10. Wings can be a little spicy, but luckily you can get some ranch for dipping.",

    "text": "We recently went to this location due to one of our favorite artists placing a show last minute. I'll break this down as best I can into sections.  Decor: From the outside, on Southern, you have no idea that the door facing the street is an exit only. There's no signs, nothing. We got promptly told by security that we came in the wrong way. Sorry, maybe put a sign up? Otherwise, there are 2 bars total. One close to the stage, and the other in an open area with a pool table. It's incredibly dark inside, very dive bar vibes. Wasn't a huge fan of how dark the bar was.  Drinks: The bar where the pool table was located was nice. They had all their beers on tap on a giant screen to review. The beer I had wasn't too bad, but my fiance's drink was nothing to scream home about. She ordered a Jameson with Ginger Beer and it was just ginger beer with a splash on Jameson. Beer was $6 bucks, and the Jameson was close to $10.  Food: So the menu here was just recently changed. We asked securtiy about the menu, and he gave us the face of, \"you really don't want to try.\" We decided to go ahead and order the Bulgogi poutine, and it wasn't too bad. The bulgogi was tasty and the sauce they had on top was decent enough.  Overall: The website said that the artists would start by 9, but it was 10pm when they began. The hours need to be updated if they want happier customers. The drinks were ok, and the blonde bartender I had was super nice. She seemed upset, but was professional. We will return for more music, and hopefully there will be a little more light.",

No drama , no BS and only one patron that had a bit too much to drink(you know, the guy that drinks so much he has to take his shirt off..yeah that guy) ....it looked like he was irritating the band. Security promptly took care of it . It's so great to go to a place where no one has attitude . I noticed that a lot of shows don't have a cover . The show I went to was a staggering $10...for 5 great bands . If you're looking for great place for local and national acts  this could be it . No pretentiousness , just great music .   Just as a side note even with earplugs it was THUNDEROUS ! If I remember PBR was $2.50 . Tons of beer selections . Lots of parking . Security everywhere ..and couldn't be nicer .   Update - I've been here a bunch of times now . Amanda and Ren are great . I finally went to the other side where you can eat . Tons of beers to choose from , taco Tuesday deals and Wednesday wings deals . The wings are out of bounds good and the \"hot\" is actually hot ! Great food while catching killer music - seriously , what else is there ?!",

Ordered two orders of crispy wings..they both came out soggy and guessing they were cooked frozen.  Bones inside were all black. Sauce was pretty good but wings didnt taste that great.  Place has little seating.  Bar is basically a big circle with a few barstools here and there around it.  Went to see a band we like and stage is offset and pointed away from bar..so you are looking at the side of the band playing.  You have to stand if you want to be in front of stage to see band perform.  Draft beer half the night was warm and served half the time in an unchilled glass.  Overall kinda dissapointed.  45 minute drive for us..not worth a future drive.  Bummer!",

Get yer PBR in the can-cold and fresh, baby.  \"Bonnie, why do you say 'Yucky'?\"  Oh...only b/c the first time I came here i discovered to my horror 3 distinct flea bites on my arm. I have gone to a LOT of dive bars and seen a lot of things I wish I hadn't...but never...NEVER have I experienced flea bites. My god. I swore off YTR forever after that incident.  But...then...my karaoke bug came back. And I heard the Thursday nights at YTR were good. Quite good. And it is close by. And they got that regrettable piss ass beer. Lets do it.   Finding the parking lot took some deducing (I still end up going through the car wash..hehehe) but ample parking and pretty easy to figure out which one is Yucca from the back with everyone hanging out smoking. I have never seen anyone smoke in that little smoking room-only drunk make outs. The bathrooms are fine. Opens up to the stage...wait, a stage. Omg. Is that a BAND? LIVE ROCK STAR KARAOKE? Oh my. This aint for the amatuers, honey. You only got a lyric sheet and the hope the band will be right on tempo so you can freak out to Hearts Crazy on You with NO prompter except the reassuring nod the of the guitarist to start the next stanza.  A supportive crowd, super regulars, locals just gettin their drink on, random characters, hipsters,the gays,  just people looking to get a lil Rolling Stones on..I mean one lady had her birthday cake here! How cute! And I do love the bartenders-tip 'em well! I tend to hang around the stage and leave the booths for the old time regulars (gotta show respect, know what i'm sayin?) and they do have the shuffle board, yes they do.  Last night I told my friend I was glad we gave it another chance to rock so hard as it does as my favourite karaoke place and I haven't experienced fleas since. She laughed and pulled up her dress to show my THREE flea bites on her thighs- \"I DID\". Maybe its time to invest in one of those wet vacs, YTR, what do ya say?  ***********  On a recent visit, I was talking to Lauren V. and felt like a small child was grabbing my leg-looked down and Gregor Samsa, Kafka's creation, was crawling up my leg. A giant cockroach! So big you could see him (Gregor) shuffle off my leg onto a dark carpet in the dark room from a couple feet away. GADDAMN.  But I still love the Yucca. Thats a damn fine dive bar, when even the above elements fail to deter you from entering the vicinity.",

    "text": "I've been going to Yucca since 1999 (the year I moved from Tucson to Phoenix) I loved this bar and it still holds a special place in my heart. My boyfriend at the time (later to be husband and ever later to be ex-husband) and I had one of our first ridiculous makeout sessions in this bar, induced by insanely strong long islands. The Yucca is where I became a professional lush.  Back in the day it was pretty skank on the inside. Everyone smoking and drinking and coughing and smoking some more. Toothless dood's hitting on my then 23 year old ass. We knew a few of the bartenders pretty well and never felt unsafe. I look back on those times fondly.   Last time I graced Yucca with my presence was about a month and a half ago. I met a friend (who happens to be 23.... odd ) for a drink after work. He lives in the area and it was a good excuse to venture into Tempe instead of holing up in my beloved CenPho like I always do.  It was a Wed. evening and they had some live band karaoke thing happening. I didn't recognize any of the bar staff or patrons for that matter... though I didn't really expect to. Is Venus still there??  The place was crawling with hipster/scene kids and it was kinda depressing. It looked like a fucking American Apparel catalog threw up all over the place.  I'm pretty sure it was the $2 cans of PBR that caused this phenom. Oh, shut your pie.... I know I drank them too. Ah well, made for some interesting people watching.   My buddy's \"friends\" showed up and they began to start  what I'm going to refer to from this point forward as \"The Hipster Olympics\".... Like playing shuffleboard with their cell phones, you know, idiotic shit like that.  I took off shortly there after, granted it was a school night. I don't blame The Yucca for this invasion, it just bummed me out because of the fond memories I have of the place.   No worries... I will return, I'll just make sure to tell my quite mature young friend to leave the very immature young following behind.",

I wish they would bring back the Disney movie marathons on Sundays, that was always awesome. The one side is the main area with the stage and a bar offering liquor and crappy drafts. The other side has like 20 taps with great micro brews and a beer fridge with more goodies.   The service is usually crappy but the food is AMAZING. Recently they redid the menu. Hands down the BEST HOT WINGS ever. I also would recommend their chicken and waffles and the french fry platter with the kimchee and Koren BBQ is great. I love chili cheese fries but their chili is like lame can chili and its nacho cheese. While the food is awesome I always get sick the next day. Not sure if its the crappy bar food quality, grease, or poor cleanliness standards. Im addicted to their wings so I will keep going back. Bottom line is: Eat their hot wings and drink good beer.",

I would feel quite awkward trying to play a show here... it's much easier being a patron.   It is indeed small and divey as a venue and just divey as a bar. Every drink was served in plastic cups when I've gone - that might change on different nights. In the back, they had a Golden Tee which I jammed my finger on almost 2 years ago (and it's still fucked up), and which kept shorting out in the middle of the game. Irritating.   It can be a pain to get in and out of because you have to make your way through clouds of smoke and people trying to watch the band in order to belly up to the bar. Also, depending on how busy it is - it can take awhile to get served.  If you're going to see the band, you may want to note that the sound mix isn't the best. Also, the acoustics in the place aren't very good either. I do kinda like that it's not the easiest place to find. I also like that it's a weird setup. This place would rank pretty low on my list of favorable places to go see a band play, but I wouldn't necessarily avoid seeing a band I like just because they are playing here.",

I guess I can't fully judge this place b/c I'm not a huuge fan of such dives and I'll probably hurt the feelings of all the Yucca faithfuls.   Live, often local bands frequent here, and again, cant judge b/c they're not my scene. I do have to say I enjoyed the non-headliner band headed by a female (wow, I'm a bad yelper, cant remember their name).   The one cool thing about this bar is that everyone seems to be doin their own thing. No one is tryin to hit on you, theyre just there to listen to their bands and have a drink or play shuffleboard. (k, am i really that sheltered, but howwww frequently do you see a bar serve their beer in can form?)  Won't go into detail, but pretty sure one too many shady things were goin down in the parkin lot.......us Mill and S-dale girls were a lil scared to enter after hangin in the lot for a mere 3 secs.  Beer on tap is about $4.5 (oooh might I mention my cup seemed a lil stinky, but thats the cleanfreak in me).  Fun to try once, probably wont ever see me there again. If I wanna do Tempe dive, I'd rather hit up the Vine on Apache and Rural......",

I've heard too many stories about people passing out, getting into fights, and having wacky adventures on the way home. I used to be all for these types of adventures but now I just like to hang out here and enjoy the atmosphere and drink soda until I explode.   The crowd can be pretty diverse I hear, but everytime I go there there are mostly \"rockabilly\" and \"rude boys\" filling the bar. I don't mind these types, but it gets a little weird when everyone is alike so much. This is a dive for twenty somethings which I love, because most bars like this attract career alcoholics, whereas this one attracts new alcoholics and alcholics in training. Thats way more fun.",

I ended up finding Rockaroke which has since then been my fix since I have no time for a band.   It's small. It's a total dive bar. The beer is cheap and there's a great list of off the wall beers and I love it!   It's a great place to go and relax and hear some music and you can seriously not beat rockaroke. Karaoke but with a backup band and not that shitty midi file-esque crap? Yeah. Awesome.   If you are going on a night when something good is going on, get there earlier than you planned on going or you won't get a seat. It can also take awhile to get a drink from the bar, but I think that's because it can become really packed there some nights.   I go often and I love it every time.",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about Yucca Tap Room. I want to love it, but right now we are in a love/hate relationship.   The interior of Yucca is dark and wood; it reminds me of some dirty fraternity house basements that I went to parties at back in my college days. The crowd is mixed and almost evenly split between True dive bar fans and the pseudo-hipsters from ASU. There was an abundance of pseudo-hipsters this past Friday night at Yucca and it started giving Yucca a slightly douchey feel to it unfortunately.  I like that Yucca has live music and some of the singers/bands we have heard have been pretty decent actually. Definitely not music you will find in a lot of other places in the Valley. I also like that they have shuffleboard, even if it is the longest shuffleboard table I have ever seen. The best part about the shuffleboard table is that it's free and doesn't have a time limit, so bonus points for that. Another gripe about clientele at Yucca...if you call \"next game\" for shuffleboard (or any other bar game for that matter), that suggests you are going to play the winner. Apparently that concept missed some frat-tastic guys at Yucca on Friday because they called \"next game\" and then their entire group proceeded to take over the shuffleboard table when my group finished our game. Grrr!  Beers are average price...my Bud Lights were $3 each. Not expensive, but higher priced than what I would expect at a dive bar. Yucca is an interesting Tempe establishment, but I prefer Monkey Pants a lot more.",

I'm not sure if they are actual thugs or just posers, but I'm pretty sure there was some drug dealing going on in the parking lot. Maybe it's just the ASU crowd but the girls were dressed pretty slutty for a dive bar on a thursday night.   The bar has two sides: the live music side seems more sketchy, whereas the beer/whiskey room is well lit with a good amount of seating and two bar sized pool tables. I heard they have cool shows, so I would like to come back to check that out. Bathroom on that side is surprisingly clean.",

One side is your classic \"dive bar\", and the other side is a little more upscale with micro brews and other fine spirits.  The food is also very good and they have great hot wings.

I go to watch Arsenal games at a bigger place at a more understandable hour in Central time now, but I still think to myself, \"Man, the bar is already open at Yucca and I can't even get something stronger than coffee. What if Mertesacker heads the ball in and we CAN'T do shots of Jager? Is this all meaningless?\" I then realize that not all is lost, but enough is.

Anyway..... Yucca is still the great 'ol spot it always was. However I don't remember the giant beer selection from years past. It was great, I spotted a few Dog Fish Head beers, come local stuff, and some fancy stuff. Def a great place for a beer drinker!  We were there to check out a few live bands. They were great. The sound guy did a good job, and the set up was nice. The booths were a little cramped, but manageable. The smoking patio could use a few chairs maybe. The bathroom was clean and acceptable.   Only thing that was irritating.... they need to manage the bands a little better, over 30 minutes between sets? After the second band, my favorite however, finished setting up then went out for a leisurely smoke for about 10 minutes. We had to leave before the third band got on. Please use time better. Would have liked to see more bands.   Had an over all good time. We will be back more often for sure!",

But what I can enjoy from an unbiased perspective is the fact that it is free to see music on Fridays (I believe, if this is still their policy).  It is a good way to get out, go to a friendly dive bar, listen to local music, and drink with some good friends.  Bar tenders are always friendly, they usually have a great selection of beers (I love their digital beer menu), and their food ain't so bad, either! You have to park in the back of the strip mall to go in, and there are usually two places to walk into: one room has the stage where local bands play, the other room has the large list of beers and has an interesting movie playing on the tvs as well as music blasting over the speakers.

I really like the fact that it is split up so you don't HAVE to listen to the music in the next room, you can hang out in a booth, at the bar, or play some pool. Small outdoor patio space along Southern if you smoke & drinks are okay too.  The location might freak some people out if they're used to hanging out in Old Town or something but I promise it is quality fun without all the spray tans & hair gel.  So many memories.

However, there are sometimes those days where you go somewhere, like Yucca, or any other food-serving bar for that matter, and you just want to eat. It's AWESOME that I can still watch the live entertainment on the televisions they have propped on the walls while still being able to hear my friends speak. Sometimes you just have to separate the ones who came for the show and the ones who came for the food.  Speaking of the food. Bar food. I mean...how good is it going to actually get? At Yucca, I have the pleasure of saying, it actually gets pretty good.   But it's still a bar... right? Yes. So the drink specials are quite comparable to other bars as well. I have to say, I do enjoy me some Yucca Tap Room. It is a place that I will continue to frequent providing I am in the area, or if I have a friend's band playing there and whatnot.",

Is looking like you just stepped out of Hot Topic still cool?  Bathrooms were gross.  Bartop was sticky and took forever to get an overpriced beer.  Had to ask 3 times for water.  Terrible music and just felt gross.  Ew.  I love dive bars, but this place is just gross.  Go across the street to Monkeypants - you'll have a better time.",

But the inside was cool, slightly divey, but still nice and relaxed.  It was a Saturday night so the beats were bumpin'!! The DJ was a bit loud, but service was good. And the rock band on the other side was pretty killer too!! I like the split between the bars to allow a little bit of diversity but sound proofing between the two sides. My only complaint? Bathroom cleanliness could have been a bit better.  Overall, great experience! Enjoyed it, would recommend it, WILL RETURN next time I'm in town!!",

The food here is American-style bar food that is better than most of the similarly themed food on Mill Avenue, and cheaper to boot. They have a load of TVs if sports are your thing, and a sizable collection of rotating taps.  The older part, where they have free live shows almost nightly is great for people who enjoy intimate venues. Bad for cigarette smokers because the patio is small, or you'll have to go out front.",

If I was gonna host a bar with live music in my living room, it would be the Yucca Tap Room. Being here feels like hanging out at a good friend's house. And I could say a lot more about the amazing beer selection, all the great bands I heard here first, and how much I love their wings & waffles (with chipotle maple syrup - thank you to the genius who thought of that). But I really think the best part of it is the vibe. Like I said, you just feel at home.",

Everything from cans to bombers and ciders to stouts.    The food here is also pretty tasty.  I had some sliders and fries.  The sliders were delicious.  The fries were a bit limp but a nice large serving.  There were also several flat screens in HD with sports playing.  I would recommend this place for anyone looking to have a great beer and good bar food and wants to watch a game.",

Live music most nights on either side of the bar. Lots of hoodied dudes with beards and vapes on one side with the other side populated by a diverse group of people united in their joint efforts to relive the 90s. Sound is loud, but unclear and muffled for concerts. Bonus points for hard cider options, but massive negative points for somewhat iffy parking lot encounters on the way to and fro. So, Tempe adventures through the safari of the parking lot + rousing coverband renditions of the greatest 90s pseudo-punk hits + good beer selection on the newer side = Yucca Tap Room.",
