We walked in at around 2:30 and the hostess said \"um this isn't brunch, so we only offer this part of the menu ( waving her hand) is this alriiight with you!??\" We said ya sure confused and we said can we sit near the bar. Her eyes ROLLED back into her head and said sure quickly gathering the menus and utensils pissed off. We finally said \"F*** this\" and said we are outta here! And we said on our way out. \"We'll be back when you have a better attitude! See ya wouldn't wanna be ya!",

    "text": "Stopped by for the happy hour on a Wednesday night (all day hh starting at 3 PM). Unfortunately they ran out of the ceviche. We ordered two of the shrimp rolls, pork taco, tofu taco, and the poke. We ordered two different drinks each (dark & stormy was one of them). The drinks were very sugary and watered down so that was a little disappointing, especially after reading all the reviews on their drinks. The shrimp rolls were our favorite and the pineapple sauce perfectly complimented / enhanced the flavor of the rolls. The pork taco was full of meat and was our second favorite dish. The sauce that they cooked the meat in was really good. The tofu taco wasn't bad but wasn't as good as the other items. The poke was a little salty and could have used chips or something to balance the flavor.   The food and drinks are 4 stars, but the service was excellent (hence the 5 star rating! It was around 6 PM and there weren't that many tables, but even so, the food and drinks came out LIGHTNING fast. The food was fresh. It didn't seem like it was sitting out for a while, waiting to be ordered. The server was on point with his presence; never overbearing but always there when we needed him. I give the cooks, bartenders, and servers an applause for their service!",

I am a big fan of all their protein loaded dishes/bowls. From the Mongolian beef bowl, Spicy Thai chicken, to my favorite the Jawaiian Jerk chicken plate, Jamaican Johnny cakes, an it's mashed potatoes and the plantains.  Just tried the Cajun ahi caesar and that too is amazing. As you can see I'm a big fan of spicy food, so if you are too I HIGHLY recommend it.  Staff here is great too. So far I've been taken care of by Sierra and Max and they are wonderful bartenders. It's also nice to find out that the person bussing your tables might be one of the managers who aren't above bussing tables for customers. All around a great place for food and hospitality!",

The place resembles most Thai restaurants up here in NYC. Don't get me wrong. It's clean and modern looking. But in NO WAY resembles a tiki bar except when mai tais with paper umbrellas on them were on the table.   Food was decent. I had a pineapple glazed grilled chicken sandwich. Coworkers had various fish dishes and drinks and enjoyed them. Waiter was kind of rude and impatient with one of our group who needed an explanation of some of the menu items.   All in all, don't come here if you're expecting a tiki bar vibe AT ALL. Come for the food which was alright, or the drinks which tasted and looked good.",

I was glad to find the menu to be filled with a wide range of variety from burgers to rice bowls. I had tried for the first time, the corn bread they have which let me say was suppose to be a side dish. Ended up taking most of the table! Which after tasting the bread, was a good thing to have some left over. Had an order of the ribs which were cooked pretty good. Though I wish the sauce had been a bit tastier. Not complaining though, ate most of them! Definitely will be coming back.",

    "text": "**Updating this review, since Dana (the owner was VERY quick to respond and went above and beyond to rectify the situation and assure me that he takes feedback seriously and handles it with grace and kindness **   I'm not sure who our server was (since he didn't introduce himself, nor did any of us want to ask) but the service last night was  really disappointing. We had a large party (15) and we called in advance (two days prior) to make a reservation. This was a going away party for a close friend, that turned in to the entire table feeling as if we were walking on egg shells because server was so condescending and rude to us. It ruined the experience for us. He told us from the time we sat down that he would be assigning seat numbers in order to make it easier to create separate checks. He asked that we \"not move\" or that he would have to spend \"a long time figuring it all out\". The only thing was, that we were still waiting on two others to join, and we even told him that they were running late but that we would all like to order drinks. It took another 15 mins or so so flag him down, because he only took the drink order for the person on the end and walked away. After ordering our first round, our additional two guests arrived and sat toward the middle of the table (I think they should be able to sit where they'd like ) but the server huffed and made us all feel really badly for \"messing up his system\". When he finally got around to taking orders, he got to the two in the middle and asked to take their order while he was flipping through his sheets of paper with disdain. The person whose order he was taking felt bad and innocently asked if it would be easier if we gave him our names. He very quickly snapped back at her, \"I'm tired, you all moved around. It's fine... I'll figure it out\" then furiously shuffled more paper. This was the tone, and the attitude he had with us for the remainder of our meal. He made us feel as if we were burdening him the entire time. I work in hospitality, and I believe that when service is great it should be recognized. On the flip side, this server could've really done a better job at making us feel welcome. Instead, we were all hesitant to ask for things knowing he would make some sarcastic remark, or give us an uneasy feeling. There were other small things, him leaning in on the back of our chairs, not bringing us all water even after we requested some, and asking us to stack our dishes and pass them to him (which, i would get if they were in hard-to-reach places, but they were not). I get that people have bad days, and it's a bummer that he was tired, but he could've made a small easy effort to ensure that things went more smoothly than they did. It's much easier to throw on a smile than let your bad energy trickle down to everyone else. I also frequent Hulas Downtown, and as always, the food and drinks were great.",

I came in the other night wanting to see how it was and lemme tell you I was totally impressed. The atmosphere was amazing. I tried the ceviche and I loves it.. the bartender Max was fantastic.. great energy and engaged with me as well as other patrons.. he made me feel comfortable and suggested the spicy teriyaki chicken bowl. .I loved it.. so glad I tried hulas because im bringing 10 to 12 ppl back for my bday dinner saturday night.. hopefully max will be there and can whip me up a bday shot haha.. I work in old town and will recommend this place to others",

    "text": "I have lived in Honolulu for a number of years and I go back to the islands every year so I am quite partial to Polynesian cuisine.  Further, I have been a breakfast person for over 40 years and have frequented every breakfast restaurant in Scottsdale to the point that I am considered a member of the family at each.  Many years ago I tried the Loco Moco plate at \"Da Kitchen\" in Kahalui, Maui and I was hooked.  Ever since that time I judge a Hawaiian restaurant by the presentation of their Loco Moco dish.  I found Hula's Modern Tiki only this past week (after being in place for 14 months) and of course you know what I ordered :))).  A slight variation on the original dish, but their own touch, that I enjoyed very much.  I went back two times already to try other dishes and each one took me back to the islands with their flavors.  This place is the closest thing that you are going to find \"Da kine\" in Hawaii.  I am so glad they are in Scottsdale.  One suggestion:  Scottsdale is a breakfast town, not a brunch town; and if you are going to open in the morning on weekends you have to open before 9AM.  Even church people won't wait until 9:30 or 10 for a restaurant to open.  Look up the street and see those other restaurants that are over crowded by 9AM.  Your breakfast is better than theirs, get it out there!!!!!!!  Advertise your existence in the Scottsdale section of the Az Republic.",

Upon arriving, we were seated immediately and helped by a waiter who was very attentive the rest of the evening.  Between the three us us, we worked our way through a couple rounds of cocktails, chicken skewers, fries, and some entrees. All the drinks we sampled were delicious, if I had one bit of feedback, it's that I wish they were garnished a little more ridiculously, like I would expect at a tiki lounge.   The food was very tasty, the chicken skewers had a delicious sauce on them and the fries were tasty; however, I'd love to see them include some sort of sauce other than ketchup with them. For our entrees my friends ordered the fish tacos and I opted for the ahi tuna bowl. Everything tasted fresh and totally hit the spot. With the great happy hour deals, our evening was a major bang for our buck.",

    "text": "Very cool menu and concept, but we will not be coming back here. The table felt like we were st s cafeteria- very small, up against a wall, cheap plastic table and chairs. Service was quick but our food came within 5 minutes of receiving our drink orders, making us feel rushed and like we couldn't sit and enjoy our drink. I got the luau pork plate which I mostly enjoyed- the sauce was delicious, and I really liked the rice and cole slaw, but the pork itself was a little stringy. My husband ordered the jerk chicken and it was INEDIBLE. The consistency was almost nauseating to him, like pureed chicken, and he has at least 5 bones in the dish. My husband is an Army vet, so he can stomach a lot of textures of food, but he looked like he was going to get sick eating it. The flavor of the jerk itself, though, was very good.   2 stars for quality of food and atmosphere. We came on a Monday night, so they might not have brought their A game as they would on a weekend.",

    "text": "Dropped by Hula's while strolling around Old Town Scottsdale.  The fiance and I were looking for a place to have dinner and we came across what looked like a hip and happening place.  Honestly a bit out of place in my opinion considering that Hula's is this \"modern tiki bar\" right in the heart of this western old town scottsdale area but nonetheless we decided to try this place out.  Hula's had quite an extensive menu with so many items to choose from I was a bit overwhelmed but our very trendy sweet server Alexis recommended their spicy Thai chicken bowl and their fish plates.  We decided to try both.  I ordered the Thai chicken bowl minus the beans and the fiance ordered the lemongrass encrusted hapu.  I was really disappointed because we originally wanted to order the butterfish but they were out but Alexis mentioned that the hapu would be another alternative option.  The fish was absolutely delicious!  Light and flakey and just every bit of perfection!  I loved it!  Very much comparable to one of my favorite restaurants I frequent in San Diego for Hawaiian fusion dishes!  YUM!  The portions here are pretty hefty as my Thai chicken bowl was huge! Definitely could feed at least two I think because I can eat for two!  Prices here are reasonable for dinner ranging anywhere from 7-26.     A great date place since the lighting is so dim it really sets the mood haha however I saw tons of families and children dining here.  Would definitely come back the next time I visit Scottsdale and recommended others to try Hula out.",

The decor is lovely - tons of blond wood, an open floor plan, 50s tiki bar feel, gorgeous bar - even the bathrooms are really cute!.    The hostess was really nice, but the server was just wonderful.  He was super helpful, gave us tons of information, and had a 100 watt smile, to boot.  On his advice, we ordered the blackened Ahi tuna sandwich, and it was amazing!!  The fish was really fresh, the seasonings really brought out the flavor without overpowering it, and light coleslaw and pico really rounded it out.  This was accompanied by some spectacular sweet and regular fries - absolutely the best fries I've tasted in a long time.  Really top-notch.",

Food was terrific, we ordered my favorite Coconut shrimp rolls with the pineapple sauce is AMAZING! I ordered the luau pulled pork with sweet potato fries, these portions are pretty generous too, I took 1/2 home. My boyfriend ordered the Jamaican jerk chicken with rice, johnny cakes and plantains. Very generous portions....and very flavorful. I posted pics on here too.   Highly recommend giving Hulas a try....oh, my favorite drink is called The Painkiller.

Hula's is a nice place to stop in for a quick drink or as part of a bar crawl thru Scottsdale as there are many other watering holes in walking distance of each other in this area.  Service is ok, pricing is on par for what they offer. But the comfort level in this place is a little weird, this isnt the place to have several cocktails & get sloppy.

I've been wanting to go since they opened in Old Town.  We reminisced about my first real concert over Hula's yummy cocktails...reliving the trip from Flagstaff in a car with no windows...in August...to see Metallica.  I wasn't even sure who that was.  I only knew he had lined up at Ticketmaster at 4am (before Al Gore invented the internet) to get good seats for his can of crazy girlfriend who refused to go at the last minute anyway.  Ah, those were the days.  And completely irrelevant to this review.  So for those of you that haven't turned the channel yet, Hula's does have some fun cocktails.  And while I love some of their appetizers, I thought lunch was just okay.  I really liked the Hawaiian ceviche with wonton chips (again, great apps).  The mango chicken caesar salad and mac salad, eh, okay.  Good, but not great.  I was also a little put off that my friend wanted to order from the dinner menu, but couldn't.  We were about 20 minutes early, and understandably, the kitchen could not accommodate, which was fine.  However even when we asked our server if we could just have our drinks for 20 minutes, and then order, she still said \"no.\"  I guess she was concerned we would take up the table for an extra 20 minutes??  That would have been another round of drinks, but I guess it wasn't worth her time.  It hasn't been worth mine to go back, although I certainly wouldn't rule it out.",

The decor is tiki/kitschy/cool...modern tiki vibe..very clean..tvs at the bar if you want to catch a game while enjoying your spirits and local grinds.  On this particular night we had a 2 year old in tow and they couldn't have been more gracious! (They even had a high chair). I was starving and my friends only a little hungry so they ordered pupus (ceviche and pork tacos) and I had the spicy ahi Caesar salad everyone was pleased with their food.  Large portion for a dinner salad..flavors were on point.  The specialty drinks are fruity and fun and usually come in a fun glass to compliment what's being served.  I love taking out of town guests here and so far everyone I bring compliments me on my great choice!",

Both he and my mom got the snapper fish, one grilled with broccolini, the other macadamia nut crusted. Both were fabulous! On top of it, our waiter, Tyler, knew the menu well, he told us his recommendations and we enjoyed everything he recommended. He was patient and listened. We really appreciate Tyler, and hula's grill! I'll definitely be back. And my parents may just come visit to go back to hula's ;)",

Not too overpowering and it's a good sized slice. What I come here for is the loco moco any time of the day. Big gravy fan and with that egg yolk. Perfect! There are bunch of ads ones as well. Add the spam or Portuguese sausage. Delicious and the portion is great. I also am a big fan of the brunch here.",

Like the platano appetizer, the fish bites and the crispy shrimp. What a great idea the coconut sauce! I was already impressed with my drink, it was a blood orange martini. Not too strong nor too sweet. I recommend it. My friend had the mahi tahi, made with rum, definitely stronger. When you come to the fish selection, there are several options like salmon, mahi, tuna and other fish. Once you have selected the fish then you can choose the condiments and preparation. We went for a blackened ahi tuna, split. It came with mashed potatoes and broccolini. The tuna was not over cooked which was my fear, but perfectly rare on the inside. We didn't make it for dessert but I will definitely come back more often, the ambience and the service are also great!",

Based on the owner's willingness to communicate with me and make amends, I'd be open to returning next time I'm in Scottsdale, and hopefully will be able to update my rating!  -----------------------------------------------------------------  Hi!  I'm vegan.  I try not to make a fuss when I eat out with friends, but Hula's made it difficult.  I've never met a more exasperated waitress in my entire life.  It started off fine enough.  \"Are your hashbrowns made with butter or oil?\"  \"Butter.\"  \"And they can't be made with oil?\"  \"No.\"  \"Okay, I'll have avocado and toast.\"  I got avocado and a buttered English muffin.  Two things - thought it was pretty clear based on our previous conversation that I'm not into butter, but also...\"I'm sorry,\" I said.  \"I can't eat English muffins.  Do you have toast, like sourdough or something?\"  Siiiigh, sure, okay.  \"Sorry,\" I called after her.  All of my friends turned towards me.  \"Why are you apologizing?!\"  \"I don't know...reflex?  She looks annoyed with me?\"  Then when she came back and said the toast would be coming up, I clarified that I didn't want butter on the toast, remembering the English muffin situation.  She stopped in her tracks, sighed, and then went to the kitchen, without saying a word to me.  Oh...wow.  What I got was Texas toast (\"no butter!\") grilled where they grill buttered Texas toast.  Okay, I'm done.  I almost ate it anyways, but the smell of butter and the hardness of the avocado stopped me.  \"It's not worth it, dude,\" I said to myself, nauseated by the smell.  Had I made it clear I was vegan, it might've been a different story.  I was trying to be easy (avocado and toast are usually so fail-safe!) but it just didn't work this time.  I have zero complaints about the $2 mimosas, and they do have a clearly marked vegan option on their dinner menu.  Both the English muffin and Texas toast were removed from my bill, so props to at least being aware that I was unhappy.  But the situation was bad enough that none of my friends wanted to go back, even though they all had great food.  I have pretty awesome friends.",

They were all delicious!  I had hot tea tonight. I liked how they brought over a selection of hot tea for me to choose & also brought over an extra pot of hot water in case I wanted refills.  The atmosphere & wait staff are consistently friendly and warm.  The place was thriving & hopping even with the rain outside & on a Sunday evening.  This is a good sign that it's a favorite spot for many!",

    "text": "I was worried about parking because we went to Hula's on Saturday evening, but had no trouble finding parking close by. I was apart of a large party and was pleasantly surprised that they were able to accommodate all of us. Hula's had one long table and it's nice for large parties or laid back dining for multiple small parties. The service was a tad slow and they only came around once to refill our waters. The restaurant wasn't very crowded either, considering it was a late Saturday evening.  I got the Samurai Beef Sticks as a starter and Jawaiian Jerk Pork Plate for my main entree and the food was delicious. The Samurai Beef Sticks were a great start. It came with 3 beef stick kabobs and the beef was so tender and the grilled pineapple was sweet and juicy. The Jawaiian Jerk Pork Plate was excellent and huge, definitely enough to serve two people. The pork had a mild kick to it and a lot of flavor. The Plate also came with a scoop of white rice with mango salsa on top, plantains, and jamacian johnny cakes. The Plate came out with a pretty presentation and was amazing!  Hula's also has many cocktail, red and white wine options with a few non alcoholic drink options too. Overall, really great food with many drink and food options, but the service was a little lacking.",

Well I am a sucker for a tiki bar so I decided to extended the bar hop to another drink, which turned into many, which turned into too many!!!    From what I remember.....   it was a very unexpected find in old town.  A very strange choice/location/interior but I loved it!  The drinks were so good, as I said, I many have enjoyed them a bit too much.  I really do remember that every one on the menu looked great and each one I ordered was amazing.  Would love to go back again some day, this time at the start of a bar hop instead of the end.  If you are into tiki bars or looking for something different in old town you should check it out.",

On a yelper's recommendation, we ordered the crispy coconut shrimp rolls with pineapple dipping sauce and they were outstanding. Probably the best part of the meal! Though I ordered it as an app, and got it after our meal was served. My mom ordered a bowl and it could have probably feed at least 2, if not more people. Delicious with the rice and cabbage. I ordered the pork tacos which were OK, they tasted way better with the salsa they provided. Dad ordered a salad, mango chicken caesar, which was a hit! Would love to go back for dinner to try the SCORPION OR VOLCANO BOWL which serves 2 or more. Lunch woudl have been a little early for that!",

    "text": "I'll start with the premise which is a Pro! I wanted to book a large party (15-17 people) for my boyfriend's surprise party. Hula's was incredibly accommodating and kind. I even called earlier that day just to add a couple of chairs and they were able to do it no problem. My boyfriend and I even ran late getting there and the service was still awesome and upbeat.   When I walked in it was kind of a Con. My boyfriend is obsessed with anything Hawaiian which is why I chose Hula's, but when I walked in it seemed more modern and was pretty small. I guess this was my fault for not having gone there before, but I just didn't think it was all that great in terms of a \"Hawaiian\" venue.  Con: I'm a huge foodie and always check out menus before I go to restaurants, so I knew I wanted to start with something small because I wasn't super hungry. I ordered the \"award winning\" ceviche which was INCREDIBLY mediocre. Maybe it was a bad day, but literally ALL I could taste was lime...it was pretty disappointing and too acidic for my stomach. I wasn't really able to finish it because of that, so that was a bit of a waste. My boyfriend ordered the Jamaican Jerk which he also said was pretty mediocre. Everyone else at our table seemed to like their food so we tried to give it another go.  Pro: We both ordered one Polynesian Chicken Sandwich and split it which was actually pretty delicious. I was excited to eat something with real flavor! The sweet potato fries were awesome too. I had forgotten to mention earlier that I ordered the \"Pink Bikini\" drink before food and asked for it in a cute tiki glass which the server did :) The drink was yummy.   Con: It was a bit frustrating with payment because we didn't love our first dishes, but luckily the prices weren't TOO bad. I just felt like we could've saved some money if we had liked our dishes the first time.   Pro: Our server was AMAZING. I wish I remembered her name. I'm super allergic to nuts and she kept asking the kitchen for anything that had nuts in it to make sure I was eating safely. Even when she brought out my boyfriend's complimentary bday ice cream, she forgot it had nuts in it so she separately brought out a plain vanilla which chocolate syrup JUST for me. She was incredibly sweet and helpful and dealt which a large party of tipsy/drunk people by herself. Truly enjoyed the service here.  All in all, this place lost a star because I wasn't super fond of the \"Hawaiian venue\" and the food we initially ordered. Luckily to make up for it, our second dish, my drink, and the service were great. I would try Hula's again if I was in the Scottsdale/Phx area but I probably wouldn't drive out there just to eat like I did the first time.",

    "text": "My Mama and I had plans to go out to dinner last Friday night but couldn't decide where to go. So, I did some googling and got on Yelp and we decided to try this restaurant.  When we got there we were immediately taken in by the open, well decorated, and well lighted space. In addition the community seating was a fun addition. However, we got seated at a quiet table for two.  Our server couldn't have been more engaging, fun, or knowledgeable about the menu. He suggested the Hawaiian short ribs for my mother and the mahi-mahi Hula styled for me. Both dishes were beyond incredible!   At the end of the meal we were given a card to fill out regarding the food and service. We gave both categories top marks and my mom wrote on the back of the card \"WE LOVE JOE, AND YOUR RIBS!\"  I went up to the front to ask the hostess if I could speak to the manager regarding our experience and she turns around, points and says \"Joe is the manager.\" We'd been served by the manager himself and he never identified himself or made himself seem above the task. She then showed him the card we'd filled out and he laughed and wanted at us with a big smile as we left.  That is an extremely rare occurrence and made us even more thrilled we'd chosen to spend our evening at Hula's.  If you are in the area and want a unique and delicious experience, definitely give Hula Tiki's a try. You will not regret it!   If you can, even request Joe as your server and it will make your dinner even more fabulous!!!",

Some especially interesting sounding tofu/vegetarian options, I will come back and try more. I tried out the black bean burger with sweet potato fries as my side. We were served quickly. Our server was nice, she did a good job. My sister ordered the same thing as me and she loved it. I did not like it as much as I thought I would have, it was just a bit bland with not enough mushrooms on it, I thought. It was good, just not super memorable. Fries were tasty, I liked the sauce they served it with too! My mom got chicken skewers and really liked them. Next time I think I would order something else, but overall it was an enjoyable experience!",

The atmosphere is amazing, very modern, well kept appearance with good music, and everything you would want in nice decor! Great design job.  The food, having strong opinions on Hawaiian food was not the best. They have some traditional dishes and some modern takes as well. We started off with the poke, which is raw tuna. The fish was fresh but the poke wasn't seasoned right or didn't have enough sauce. Kinda poke light if anything. Had the pork dumplings that came with two dipping sauces, they were standard dumplings you can get anywhere. Also tried their meat skewer which was just okay. Overall I was left wanting the True Island taste that has so much to offer.  Based on the appetizers I tried I didn't want to try any entree after that. I am a little biased when I comes to Hawaiian food, expected a little better. This still is a fun spot and I would try it if you want something that is harder to get in many places.",

I have to say, it doesn't really deliver as a 'tiki bar,' so keep that in mind if you're looking for the old school kitschy type tiki lounge.  It's really a restaurant with a couple of tiki type pictures.  So after my initial disappointment about that, we got down to the business of ordering drinks and food. The drinks were pretty much what you would expect; pricey, tropical, and packed a punch.  The food was much better than your typical bar fare.  We weren't there in time for happy hour, but the HH prices and selection looked like a good deal.  The service was great as well.  I'd love to see them tiki the place up a bit and it would be perfect!",

    "text": "What a great surprise find in the Old Town Scottsdale area. We didn't know about the original location in Phoenix, but this location was recommended to us by my hairstylist that also is in the area. The parking lot is very small (about 5 spots) and doesn't have an exit, so be warned that you may be doing a 10-point u-turn to get out of it when there are no spots.  That is really the only down side, which isn't really too bad considering all the parking around the area!  They were running Happy Hour (which they even have on weekend) so we ordered a Mai Tai and the Dr. Funk, both of which were very good, although the Dr. Funk would win 1st in our book.  I had the crispy coconut shrimp rolls, which were phenomenal, and the pineapple dipping sauce was just the icing on the proverbial cake here.  For lunch I had a burger with blue cheese. He had the pork tacos.  I'll probably get the tacos next time around, since they were cooked perfectly and the garnish was fresh and amazing.  My burger was cooked exactly as ordered, and the blue cheese was great - I just think I'll mix it up next go round with tacos!  Our server was Charles, and he was incredibly nice. He made great recommendations both with food and drinks, so if you can sit in his area, do it.  Overall: A+ Go there. Get coconut shrimp rolls. Dr. Funk is amazing. You won't regret it.",

We had a super happy hour with great cocktails and good appetizers.   At first I thought my painkiller cocktail with a rum float was weak until I started feeling it!   More than worked for me.   Significant other enjoyed his zombie.    We split the coconut shrimp rolls,  curry shrimp,  and pork tacos.  All surprisingly good and reasonably priced.     Service was fun, friendly and fast!     No problem finding a parking, but a lot of that was luck.   Wish Hula's sold more merch!   The staff had cool shirts, tank tops,  hoodies, but none for sale.   So disappointed!   We did buy a really cool double old fashioned glass though.   It was the only thing for sale.    Suggest getting some Hula-wear for the public!",

Had the tacos (pork). Comes with black beans and white rice. The sides are plain but the tacos and seasonings are fantastic. Friends had the chicken tacos which are only slightly above average.   All in all, good flavors with the tacos, friendly service and great vibe. Definitely recommend for brunch on the weekend.",

The mango was not ripe so it wasn't as sweet as it could have been but still very tasty!  We have been back a couple of times now and love the drink selection.",

Hula's hash for brunch was amazing, sweet potato fries are yum ... Dr Funk, Zombie and Tiki Bastard are among my fave drinks. I did not care for the lilikoi (passion fruit) margarita, but there are plenty of other options to choose from.  I haven't done the lunch or dinner menu yet, but I'm sure I will soon!  I'll be trying out a veggie/vegan option next time.  The layout is nice and hasn't been overly crowded on any of my visits.  I've always been able to get a table and/or sit at the bar.  Tables are comfy and they have a big community-style table in the bar area that would work good for a group doing drinks & apps during happy hour (which they've dubbed tiki hour.)",

The beef sticks are a kabab with pineapple and green onions and a curry sauce- OMG, so good. Mai tai was wonderful- not too sweet, just right. Entrees were good too, but not the best part. Luau pork was good -came with plain rice and plain slaw. The jerk pork was good and came with a dry zucchini type bread and really great plantains. Service was FANTASTIC!  I would definitely go back. It's always fun to try different places.",

Usually my go to's are the Hula Burger or Korean Wings which sounds pretty basic but the flavor and quality of the food is amazing. I also like being able to order the Mac salad as a side opposed to fries. Most of their cocktails are made with rum but I do love the Bikini Martini because it has the perfect amount of froth! I recommend this place, you won't be disappointed!",

Most people recommended the coconut shrimp rolls and spicy Thai chicken bowl. We ordered the shrimp rolls, the chicken bowl, a side of macaroni salad, and the snapper cook blackened wasabi style. The shrimp rolls were superb, but the main dishes were not good at all. The fish was dry and hard, and we sent it back. The spicy Thai chicken bowl had a sliced chicken breast on top with a strange sauce. I ate two bites and left the rest. The Mac salad totally lacked mayo and salt, and the noodles were undercooked. The waiter didn't inquire why my whole entree was still sitting there at the conclusion of our meal. It was basically $50 wasted. Maybe it was an off night for their chef, but based on what we were served, I wouldn't recommend dining here. I will say that the atmosphere of the restaurant was very nice, so I would probably recommend  just getting the shrimp rolls and cocktail if you do try it out.",

Earlier this summer, I decided I wanted to celebrate my birthday here, and had a group of about 20 people. The managers were SO accommodating and easy to work with, even with short notice since my friend had accidentally booked our initial reservation at the PHX location by accident. They responded to my emails and calls very quickly and it washed away any anxiety I was having!  They were so kind to me and made me feel special on my birthday. The waiters are always so kind to me regardless of the occasion as well. The food and drinks are so delicious and unique, so it really does make it an all around great experience. I love the happy hour menu too, and getting texts to my phone about the secret deals.  During the cooler months too, they also open the large doors in front too, which is nice to have the fresh air. The only hard thing can be parking since it's old town, but fortunately, I've always been able to snag a spot in their lot.  Thank you for being one of my favorite restaurants in town!",

There were, however, plenty seats available if we wanted to eat there.  Second, I needed the meal to be gluten-free, so I actually emailed the restaurant in advance asking for their gluten-free menu. The owner, Dana, was so wonderful and responded immediately. He sent me their gluten-free menu, which had TONS of options. Typically, if you need to eat gluten-free due to food allergies, you have a very limited menu to choose from, and none of them are exciting.  This was not the case. I had plenty of things to choose from and ordered the plate that came with pulled pork, white rice, plantains, mango salsa and they even subbed an extra scoop of rice instead of the cornbread that came with it that wasn't gluten-free.  We have an amazing experience and I can't wait to eat my leftovers today.",

I started out with the Blood Orange Martini. It was delicious. Not too sweet, not too bitter, it was refreshing.   Then my friend and I started sharing cocktails so we could try a few different ones and not get totally blitzed on only our 2nd stop. LOL. We tried the Dr. Funk which was Ah-mazing and went down very fast and smooth. Those could get you in trouble.   After that we tried the Hula's Hurricane and it was also very good. Not your typical hurricane, but still really nice. Very festive.   Our service and servers were awesome. We started out at the bar, then wanted to sit outside, but the wind got to us after a bit, so then we moved back inside to a table. Never once did I feel like we were a bother, and they happily accommodated our whims.   I saw on the menu that they had Moco Loco, one of my favorite dishes, but sadly we had eaten just before coming there. Wish we would have come back the next morning.   This was a fun way to hang out and people watch and have some wonderful cocktails. Definitely a must go-to.  Oh, I forgot to mention, it was Happy Hour all day and the cocktails were like $6 each! A great deal!",

Very tasty pineapple jalapeno sauce with them. We also got the Cajun burger and it was good, nothing crazy special. I would really love to see some burger options with Pineapple on them (due to the theme) and I was expecting to see one before I arrived :/ I love pineapple on burgers!   We got a to-go box for some of our food and our fantastic server went to the trouble of hand writing \"Hula's\" and the date so we would know how fresh it was and what it was. It's the little things that make you go back to a restaurant and we will definitely be back! One last thing, the atmosphere at the Phoenix location seems to be just a bit cooler but this is a great choice if you're close to Scottsdale.",

    "text": "Finally a long awaited review for Hula's Modern Tiki. I wanted to go several times and try different items before writing this review.    The first time I went I wanted to write a 5 star review. The second time the same thing and finally still the same so I feel pretty confident in giving Hula's 5 stars.   I have never had a bad experience. From the moment you walk in to the moment you walk out.    First of all you are in downtown Scottsdale. Which is great on its own. Second this restaurant has the open concept where it makes you feel like you are inside and outside.  It's airy and during this time of year just beautiful.   The service and the staff are all very friendly and very prompt. The prices are very reasonable and the food is delicious.   I have gotten the bowls several times and have never been disappointed. They are large and will leave you feeling full. The salads are also large. I will also go as far to say that the south sea fish tacos are the best fish tacos I have EVER had. If you try them and don't agree and know of a better place please let me know :).   I could go on and on but Hula's has earned my business and I have recommended it to several people since.   I will be back Hula's.",

Looks like this isn't the first time a customer has seen a piece of hair in their food as another yelper has mentioned this too. Not only was this disappointing, but the fish bites weren't satisfying either, as if I were eating a microwaveable/frozen fish. The two stars only go for the cocktail I had and the nice bartender.",

We sat on the cozy little patio, and enjoyed a really nice afternoon of snacking, drinking, and people watching in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale.

Service is extremely slow and the staff doesn't seem to be very attentive. Food took a long time to come out and then when it finally arrived it was extremely disappointing. There wasn't any kind of flavor or wow factor. The food seemed to be weird combinations of ingredients and was extremely bland and everything was mushy. Ended of sending my fish back and my friend I was with (who will eat anything) only ate half their meal. If they could make the food actually good here this place would be amazing, unfortunately food seems like an after thought and the drinks a priority",

Like I said above, I realize that there were difficult circumstances that we were all dealing with. This happens in life but truly how a person, and especially a manager, reacts and responds to difficult things is the difference. And would have made all the difference in this situation because we are understanding people. As I mentioned Ronnie acted very rudely and it was disturbing to say the least. I know you were not there to witness his behavior but hopefully it can be improved. Yelp is a platform designed to make aware of possible opportunities for improvements, not for bashing.

It had the perfect amount of peppers and onions too. Served with wontons to scoop it all up!   Thai chicken bowl - chicken breast with a creamy thai sauce, served with perfectly cooked rice and beans. The portion was huge and the cabbage and Avocado were a nice touch.   Great selection of Hawaiian beer and wine as well. I had the pineapple wine - never tried it before and it was excelled.   Service was speedy at the bar!",

The fish cakes were soggy and seemed like the fish was spoiled because they didn't taste good more spoiled instead so needless we could not ear them. Is this what a restaurant should be selling to their customers? The chicken had absolutely no flavor and was hard as if over cooked. The drink was 90% ice and I think they just waved the vodka bottle over the top with out putting anything in the glass as it totally tasted like soda water. They don't give their drinks away either.  So far today my husband and I have spent way too much time in the bathroom from eating here. Since we did not ate at any other restaurant it is easy to figure out that this restaurant was the reason....Very sad you have to try a couple items before you know you are not going to sick from eating their poorly prepared or spoiled food.They should have food and drug inspectors stop by for a visit. Eat at your own risk!!!!!",

Nice vibe and very helpful staff.  They had the front completely open and I chose to sit out there.  The hostess noticed the table needed to be wiped down and ran to get a dish rag, much appreciated.  Menu is fairly deep but I was fixated (as always) on the tacos.  I choose two, the sweet pork and the habanero lime tacos.  Both were bursting with flavor.  The pork was delicious, some of the best I've had and I make this at home a lot!  The habanero lime tacos were excellent, really not spicy so I'm not sure they're named correctly but still the flavor profiles were fantastic.  Had iced tea and it was excellent, very good and my server kept it full.  Overall, I'll go back and take the Princess along (she wasn't happy I went without her).  Great food and service.",

The restaurant is modern, clean, and comfortable, but sterile with only the vaguest hints of Hawaii.  The service, for us at least, was polite but uncaring and sometimes inattentive.  And the food was mainly average with an occasionally below average item thrown in.    For example, what they call a Luau platter contains very pedestrian BBQ pulled pork, not luau style at all.  When you bake a pig in an earth over, wrapped in banana leaves, you get the meat that you don't really have to shread because it falls apart.  And you get the whole hog mixed together which adds a complexity of flavors and textures.  With shredded pork shoulder or butt you get pulled pork.  It's not the same thing, and Hula's version is not even a good rendition of pulled pork.  None of the other items was much better, except for the sweet plantains (hard to ruin) and the rice.    Hula's squeaks by with three stars but it could have gotten two for the disappointment.",

    "text": "Bless Your Heart.  Oh, bless your little heart Hula's.  I'm a little behind on reviewing this new location because I've been swamped with visitors.  Had I done so earlier from all my previous visits, my review would have garnered more stars.  Kinda glad I dropped the ball.  So I call to make a reservation for a party of 6.  I was told that they only take reservations for 8 or more and to just 'walk in'.  In March.  Seriously?  Walk in during spring training with six people?  In Old Town.  I was also told it was \"no problem to walk in\"   Um, yeah.  I'm a local not a tourist and I know better.   Eh, whatever. I decided to take my people elsewhere where we could get a reservation. No big deal.   I did however, post that I think not taking reservations for 6 is a bad idea.    The obnoxious response I got on Facebook, however.  Bless your heart.  BEing told I \"missed out on a great time\"  is almost comical.    REally?  Your response to a frequent customer's complaint is to tell me how I \"missed out on a great time?!\"       While I in no way expected a \"hey, we will change our policy for you\" response, I sure as hell don't appreciate the \"too bad, you missed out\" comment. A simple professional comment such as , we apologize, or wish we could help, or any other bevy of comments would have been more appropriate.  Bless your heart Hula's.  I shall be taking my large parties elsewhere. My large parties continue the entire month of March.  I shant' be bringing visitors there.   so , Hula's.. \"you missed out\" on really large bills from a bunch of drinkers and out of town visitors with money to spend!",

I sat at the bar and Hulas does not skimp on their pours. Service at the bar was friendly and prompt.   The menu is amazing and it took me a while to decide. I was using Yelp mobile and reading all the reviews and each \"you have to try this App or entree\" review just added to my indecision. I finally decided to order the Ahi tuna tacos and they were seared perfect, spicy, and served on a bed of coleslaw. A side of rice accompanied my tacos. I would highly recommend Hulas for their cocktails, Apps, and entrees. Lastly they have a great extended happy hour. I believe they have daily speciasl as well.",

    "text": "So when I heard Hula's was opening another location (thank you Yelp!) I knew I had to be there for the Grand Opening. Turns out so did quite a few other people! Hula's is a very popular place. With good reason. Killer drinks, great ambiance and the food is just like it is at the Phoenix location. This is a really fun place to hang out. Just awesome!  For food this time I tried something different. I opted for the Fish Sandwich, with  blackened hapu, taco slaw, sun-dried tomato pesto aioli. It's huge! (Served with way too many fries.) And yet, I continued to eat well past my filling point.   Here's why. The sandwich melted in my mouth. It was spiced, but not hot! hot! hot! burn the place down. Just enough kick to keep things interesting. If I hadn't planned to paint the town red I could have readily saved half for lunch the next day. BUT NO. I ate it all. (And then I complain about my dress size. Pfft!)  For drinks I started off with a porter. As the holidays are a fond memory (unless you had to wrap too many presents) I fear that my dark beers will be saying farewell. Get this! This Hula's stocks Black Butte's Porter (in a bottle). Be still my heart. {Flutter, flutter}    If that wasn't enough Hula's makes a wonderful Dark & Stormy. As it was before the end of a witching hour, I made off with HH pricing. These bartenders really know what they're doing with this drink! It had just the right balance of ginger.   Hula's is upfront about telling you the cost on the menu for built in gratuity. Larger parties have 18% built in. Split checks on groups have 20% built in. A bunch of us strolled in and were able to sit at a communal table. I'd highly recommend making a reservation if you can. (For parties of six or more.) This is a hot spot!  p.s. Thank you Yelp friends who dressed in 50's Vegas/Palm Springs attire just for the fun of it!",

    "text": "A friend and I came in on a Thursday night around 11 hoping to get a late night bite and check out Hula's Modern Tiki (formally Big Earls BBQ). Upon arriving  we were informed the kitchen was partially open due to the late hour and would not be able to prepare select items on the menu. Not really too hungry we were fine with the limited selection. The special on Thursday nights features a word of the day you can access through Facebook that grants you 2-4-1 drinks. We decided to try out their Hula Mai-Tai which is a stronger, less sweet twist on the traditional cocktail. It was the perfect balance of rum and tart citrus.    We then started with the white fish ceviche, which was light and delicious. The accompanied wontons provided the perfect amount of crunch. We scarfed the plate down in a matter of minutes, which was followed by our ahi tuna tacos. They were a bit on the spicy side for my own preference, but were pulled together nicely by their rice and beans which cooled the dish down a little, the ahi wasn't incredible but by far not the worse.   For being as late as it was I was happy with the attentiveness of our server and the overall ambiance of the restaurant. My date was on shazam the whole course of our dinner looking up long lost songs she had forgotten over the years.   Overall, I enjoyed my dinning experience at Hula's and am eager to come back earlier in the night to try other entrees that I missed out on ( the ribs!!! ). There is definite potential and the fun, laid back atmosphere accompanied by a extensive tropical drink menu will lead to a successful addition to Old Town.",

I felt like I was in Key West or Rocky Point with the festive drinks and decor. One of the girls set a reservation ahead of time and that was an absolute Godsend, otherwise I couldn't imagine us sitting anywhere. We had a large portion of the bar-top table set aside for us, and we actually needed more! I felt bad for the group of 5 who was seated immediately next to us as after awhile they moved down because we had no more space to squish people in.   Our server was fabulous and made rounds every so often to make sure everyone was doing ok or needed to order something. Definitely take advantage of the happy hour [all-day on Wednesdays!] because the food and drink specials can't be beat. I went with the Hurricane to start, and tried no other drinks the rest of the evening because it was SOOOO GOOD! I think everyone in the group had fun with the drinks alone since they were served in fun glasses. If you need some bites for happy hour, definitely go with the sweet potato fries and wings. Each order can probably serve 2-3 people depending on hunger level.",

The servers and bartenders are awesome, the food always comes out quickly and well prepared and the team seems to work well together.  *Ambiance, upbeat, lively, and a mix of people from families to a young and older bar crowd all among the mix.  It can get loud at peak times so if that bothers you, come at a little \"off-hours\" and it's more peaceful. * Food- Consistent, quality, and priced fairly for what you get.  You can find something for everyone on the menu from the vegans to the carnivores.  It's not quite the same as in the \"Islands\" some of it is their own take on it, but it works. *Drinks - Great, interesting drink menu, solid pours, great flavor and fun to share and try different things.

    "text": "We explored old town Scottsdale and stopped into Hula's Modern Tiki for a late lunch.  The restaurant wasn't busy at this time of the afternoon, yet we found the staff to be unfriendly.  The hostess really didn't greet us, just walked us to the table, tossed the menu's down and walked away.  Our server came over and she was very nice which was refreshing.  Another guy stopped by the table and Mr. Bee asked a question and the way he answered the question was so condescending.  So we came to the conclusion the bartender who was also taking our order was the only person who was friendly.  We found the menu to have some eclectic and interesting dishes with several vegetarian options.  Mr. Bee ordered Lobster bisque which was delicious.  The soup was creamy with chunks of perfectly cooked lobster.  I ordered a curry tofu dish over rice with black beans and caramelized plantains that was scrumptious.  Seasoned very well and spicy.  The plantains cut through the spice and added a lovely sweetness to the dish.  The drinks were very good and we loved the tiki glasses they were served in.  Just wish the staff would have been more fun.",

    "text": "I'm giving this place 3 stars solely based on the attentive staff and decor. Of the food we sampled, I had the lobster bisque soup and the only reason I got it was to see how the flavor of coconut milk blended. It was nice, but subtle so some restraint was shown there, which is appreciated. We got the edamame, which surprisingly was the best menu item and welcomed surprise. I had the Mongolian beef skewers, and something tasted gummy, and at fort I thought it was the dipping sauce but turns out it was the beef. My husband had some kabi (or something like spelled like that) beef ribs. Turns out the were not actually ribs, but riblets and they were tough. All in all, not a place I'd go back to, but then again I'm just a tourist passing by from Miami.   UPDATE on 5/17/2017 I'm updating to a four stars, because management reached out to me, promptly and informed me that Kalbi ribs are supposed to be like that. Like I said, what do I know? Lol. Also, although we didn't ask not to pay, it was nice that management stated we shouldn't have been charged for something we didn't like. And that's much appreciated.",

I am so excited to finally find a quality restaurant in Old Town that has it all:  -great food with lots of fun, delicious options -fantastic service -good ambience -a nice crowd   The one downside of this place is the decor. Sort of a random choice on seating arrangements--only a couple good seats in the whole place.   Sit with Ronnie--he's a Hula's veteran and he's a fantastic server. Try the coconut crusted hapu and the blackened ahi sandwich. To die for!! The Tiki Bastard is a fun twist on the classic Moscow Mule. Great place!!",

    "text": "Last night was our first time to visit Hula's. We love Hawaii and Hawaiian food so it seemed like a great choice. My wife and I shared the Lobster bisque and the coconut shrimp rolls. These were the highlights of our meals, especially the bisque. It is a bit spicy and a little different from a traditional bisque, but I would definitely order this again. For entrees my wife had the coconut encrusted Hapu and I had the ribs.  Both were good, but not spectacular. Her Hapu had way too much sauce on it, but once she scraped off most of the sauce it was good.   The one big negative was the noise level. It was very loud and made worse by a very obnoxious group at the bar who had obviously already had many drinks. We wanted desert but the yelling from the bar area made it very hard to enjoy our meal. I don't know if this is typical. I would go there again, but if the noise level was a loud as it was when we went, I wouldn't return again. Too bad, good food and a fun vibe.",

However, we'd never been here before and ended up going here probably 5 times for food or drinks.    They mix fun drinks in Tiki cups if you're into that sort of thing.  They also have a big drink that they put booze in the middle of and light it on fire for a fun effect for groups.  It's great like most awesome places in Scottsdale that the front is open, which is a nice vibe as well.  There were also a few TVs at the bar if you're into sports.  It's a great mix of restaurant and bar atmosphere in my opinion.    What stood out for me food wise was the Mongolian beef dish and I had to fight off others from tasting too may samples becuase it was so delicious.  This will always be a good spot for food and/or drinks when I'm in Scottsdale!",

I know the reality of waiter's hard word - and how they can have crummy days... but this was beyond that. She was just rude with no regard for the person I was with or me.  If I wanted to feel shitty about myself - I could have stayed home and tried to cook.   But the bartender was nice, the food was okay - I just wish I could say the same about my server. But meh... I don't have to spend my money here. I won't be back.",

We all raved about our food individually however my favorite was the ISLAND STYLE POKE* raw ahi, soy sauce, sesame oil, avocado, onions, macadamia nuts. It was on the starter menu but It could easily be a meal for one and it was amazing. For dinner two of us split the JAWAIIAN JERK PORK PLATE slow roasted pulled pork, jerk sauce, plantains, rice, mango salsa, jamaican johnny cakes which was yummy. I am not too much of a rice fan, so I ordered the Wasabi mashed potatoes. They were good, however I recommend more wasabi. On Wed it's happy hour drinks and happy food menu all night long a nice perk.   My only recommendation would be is cut down on your menu items. Too much food to choose from and too many drinks as an option. Although the drink names are cool and the drinks look awesome it gets over whelming for the customers to make a choice. Just think of all the money that could be saved if the restaurant cut down on its menu. I will be back....",

    "text": "Everyone that knows me, knows knows that Hulas is my favorite bar. Ever since stepping inside the Camelback location for the first time, I knew this was the set up for me. When I heard that they were opening up a second location, I had to go Opening Night. This location does not disappoint!   ~Fud/Drink~ I really...honestly... don't know where to start. I could start with the Hawaiian-style food, like the array of tacos this place dishes out that will blow your taste buds away. My favorite tacos of all-time are here, their Ahi tuna tacos. Beyond legit and beyond comprehension with a soft seer and perfectly peppered. I could jump to their Fish cakes (only on Tiki Hour) which explode with flavor in the mouth. Boom goes the dynamite. And goodness, where do I begin with the flavors from the drinks?!?! The crowd favorite is the Mai Tai, which is nowhere near as fruity or sweet as a traditional Mai Tai. It is their best seller, however, mainly because it is a well tailored drink. Oh and the Dr. Funk will get you Funked up. I is so smooth! And how about a little bit of love to The Zombie, which I personally think is the best Zombie I've tried. I also was introduced to Pyrat Rum here, my personal favorite rum, from the One Eyed Pyrat. That is how you will find me, with a One Eyed on the rocks, light on the ginger beer. Folks, they kill it here.  ~Atmosphere/Service~ I always drink at the bar. It saves me on time, and the barkeeps are quite personable. They always offer up helpful suggestions and make sure I am feeling good. The atmosphere at this location is a bit weird, however, because there are so many options in Old Town. It will get packed for a 1 hour period then die off...only to have it get packed all of a sudden again. Needless to say, if you come during a basic off-period, its not because the place is lame...hardly that. I also love the tiki feel, its like taking a plane ride to Hawaii. There are no gimmicks or silly themes, its really a straight up dope place to have a drink with a friend or that girl you like kinda sorta ;-)  ~The Downlow/Extras~ Two extras to note: Each day during the week, minus Friday's , they have a killer special. Check the website for updates, but my personal favorite would be the Tuesday 2 for 2 night, where you get two drinks and 2 drinks for $20. I usually clean house that night. They always have a charity night on Mondays, where 10% of profits go to a charity of their choosing, SO GENEROUS! Also, they usually will have an all-day happy hour surrounding holidays, like Pre-Thanksgiving or Pre-Christmas, etc. Just to note in case family is in town, or if you are thinking about leaving town a day early....maybe wait a few hours and have a couple here, haha. This place just makes my day better knowing I can hop over anytime I want. 5 stars for the drinks, food, Tiki Time, and honestly Dana being the most personable owner in Phoenix. Spend your money here knowing it goes locally, and its a killer time. Aloha!",

Our waitress stopped by once during that time to check on our drinks.  It seemed the place was just extremely slow overall because the people around us that were there when we got there had to wait a long time for their food also.  The food was disappointing again.  I ordered a plain cheeseburger.  I actually said plain, just meat, cheese and ketchup.  It came COVERED in onions.  There is nothing I despise on this earth more than onions.  My hatred of onions is worse than Lord Voldemort's hatred of Harry Potter.  The waitress tried to take it back but there's absolutely no way I'm going to sit around and wait for another hour for a 2nd order so I told her to leave it.  It then took forever to get our check and pay the bill.  I know other people enjoy this place but I can't think of any reason I would ever eat here again.",

My husband and I were in Phoenix for the weekend and decided to try out Hula's on our last day as we have never tried Hawaiian food back at home. The place was highly rated at Yelp, and the restaurant didn't fail to impress us! Our waiter was super friendly who gave us free refill of our drinks (we just ordered ice tea and lemonade- nothing fancy, but it was really good). Although it was Hawaiian, the restaurant offered tastes from all parts of the world-thai, Japanese, etc. We ordered the lobster bisque as starters and the Mongolian beef bowl and the ahi tuna-wasabi bowl as entree and it was absolutely delicious! We were so hungry and the food was so good that we finished it in minutes. The lobster bisque was yummy...The gravy in both the bowl dishes was just about perfect and the combination of rice and black beans were spot on. I will definitely come back here next time I visit Phoenix!",

I love the Mai Tais, which have a nice lime bite as opposed to being overly sweet like you get some places. I haven't had too many of the actual entrees, but the apps are delicious (Especially the coconut shrimp rolls, and the Poke w/ the wonton chips) and the all night happy hour on wednesday is pretty sweet, especially considering the \"weight\" of the drinks. A nice, tasty buzz for a good value, even more so since it's in $cottsdale. Keep it up Hula!",

Personally, i love drinks that come out on fire. I had the Cajun ahi salad and it was light, crispy, and the ahi was seasoned well. The only thing I would have changed is the wontons (there were soo many of them). I am also not a huge fan of plain iceberg lettuce salads, but at least it was fresh. My gf had the fish tacos and she seemed to really enjoy them. Overall, the food here is good, but I would suggest coming here for the seafood and drinks.",

It seems like the idea is to have the absolute bare minimum of traditional tiki decor such as the Witco style tiki heads on the wall to still be able to call yourself a tiki establishment.   Too bright, too clean for my idea of a tiki bar.  Maybe I'm just old school.",

The first time we waited over 45 minutes for our food with minimal service from our waiter. Today I decided to order take out (so no wait). When I arrived there were only 3 people in the restaurant (weird for 12:30pm) but my food was ready and waiting. When I got back to the office to eat it I realized they did not give me any side to my sandwich just the sandwich that I paid full price to get. I am very disappointed in this location as I feel it is giving Hulas a bad name. Please know the downtown Phoenix location has great service, great atmosphere and amazing food do not let this location spoil your Hulas experience just travel over to Phoenix next time you want to visit!  **update!**After writing this I received an immediate response from the Scottsdale location owner Dana with apologies and discussion on my experience to make the experience at Scottsdale as great as Phoenix. I really appreciate her reaching out and taking my feed back to make everyone's experience better. I will also note that my take out service was great the staff were prompt and very friendly. I hope this Hulas location becomes the greatest yet!",

We all shared and tasted each other's food and loved it. Kids had the Mac n cheese and the grilled cheese, and I had the ahi tuna tacos, someone had the tofu dish with plantains.

The bartender was helpful on questions with the drinks and made them very fast.  I mean the tiki mugs the drinks get served in makes the experience better. Having a drink in a cool mug what gets better then that. The best mug has to be the dr funk you have to try it   The food is pretty good but the drinks make this place more memorable. Didn't get a chance to try the bartenders special drink but we will when we make it back to this place.    It's a open spot with a view of outside to people watch and close to anything you need to get to.",

It was a very busy Sunday morning, but other places along Scottsdale Road were ripping, so I didn't feel bad about the non-existent wait. It's very refreshing to walk into a restaurant and have linen napkins, the atmosphere was very pleasing albeit a little loud. Our server Tyler, was on top of things took our order, and food came out piping hot and most excellent. I had the hula Burger and can highly recommend it. We don't normally do dessert, but had the coconut cream pie, and OMG. Needless to say we will be going back, and probably frequently. The food was excellent, servers were excellent, prices extremely reasonable.",

Then she finally took our order and didn't even smile at all and really never spoke to the women at the table. Part of being a server is connecting with your customers.  This young lady might consider this in the future. Lucky for her that one of guys left her a decent tip. I would not have.  All that said the food was really good. The Loco Moco was as good as I had in Hawaii and any place that has Spam on the menu makes me smile. The price was fair and I would come again and hopefully not get our sever.

Like the other location, parking is small and practically non-existent. Keep this in mind when visiting. It is best to park at one of the many other parking structures in downtown Scottsdale and then walking to Hula's. It will save you a parking headache.  The actual restaurant is pretty open with a small wrap-around patio. Inside has a bar and plenty of tables for small to large groups. As you walk in, the hostess greets you and asks for inside or out. We chose inside and were seated immediately. Our waitress was young and friendly. They all wore uniforms, which (if I remember correctly) the Phoenix location staff doesn't.   We were in time for happy hour, so my husband and I each ordered a Dr. Funk - coconut rum, creme de banana, pineapple and orange juice. Additionally, we ordered the crispy coconut shrimp rolls - only $5 at happy hour. For dinner, I ordered the steak tacos and my husband ordered the big kahuna (a large ribeye steak). Our drinks arrived promptly and our shrimp rolls arrived shortly after. The drink was perfection and the rolls were delicious. Once we finished our appetizer and first round of drinks, our dinner arrived. Both of us ordered our steak medium rare and they came out cooked perfectly. The tacos were especially flavorful and I love the rice with beans side dish. My husband enjoyed his steak as well saying it was tender and flavorful.  Overall, we had a great time. This location is just as good as the Phoenix location and we'll be back for sure!",

Its very lively here even on a Tuesday night.",

We went on a Saturday just missed the lunch menu, but it was happy hour until 7 PM so that was nice. Four dollars for a draft longboard and big wave. Ordered chicken tacos and they were pretty good a little on the dryer side but they were still satisfying. A little pricey for the food portions. It would have been worth itat lunch menu prices though. I like the whole vibe of the place, would not mind going back!",

We tried two of the different kinds. The wasabi style is fantastic, though I would have preferred a bit more of the wasabi flavor. My girlfriend had a style of fish that ended up being slightly overcooked. I would highly recommend the ceviche. It was the best part of the meal. The ambiance is nice, but it does feel out of place in Old Town Scottsdale.",

    "text": "I so wish you could give stars by dept. We have been to Hula's now on two occasions. The first was a Friday night just for a drink. We had a Scorpion for 2 and it was delicious and well made. Service could have been a bit friendlier from the bar staff. A guy waited on us and was nice but there was also a female bartender with dark straight hair who looked at us and just kind of stood there while he jumped in. It was after main dinner hours so maybe she was just getting cut but it didn't look to good, at least to us. We did enjoy our drinks and knew we would be back. Second visit, party of 4 and we sat at the bar. Daniel was the bartender and was very friendly and attentive. He got us set up with menus and we ordered cocktails. My friend and I shared a scorpion for 2 since she had heard my rave review. It was good but not as well balanced as my first visit. These large drinks should always be made with portion devices/jiggers! It was a bit strong and I was feeling it the next day, fun night though!  This is where I wish I could put the star review to the right dept. as we started to order the list of things you were out of or weren't available was a bit lengthy and in no way Daniel's fault. He made some good alternative suggestions but it's really not cool to put your staff in that position. We enjoyed what we ended up getting.  In the end and will certainly be back. The build out and decor is great. Cushions for the metal chairs would be a nice touch though. Wish we had more sidewalk dining in oldtown. Smart move there!",

    "text": "I love their Downtown location and when I heard about the new location in Old Town Scottsdale I just about flipped.  Being very familiar with their downtown menu (especially their signature drinks) I came in to see how (or if ) this place could really hold its own relative to the Downtown Phoenix location.    Hands down, this Hula's is just as good as the Downtown location.  While the ambiance is different between the two locations, the food and drink are consistent.   I have a few favorites that have carried over from the Downtown location.  Drinks - While every one their signature drinks is *AWESOME* [yep have worked my way through that list a few times at the #dtphx location] my favorite is the Dr. FuNk, followed closely by their Mai Thai and Pain Killer.  It's easy to slurp down these luscious libations, especially while enjoying the lovely Arizona weather.  But be warned, you will want to have a DD, Tipsy Tow or your favorite taxi/driver service on speed dial. It sneaks up on you!  As soon as you stand up, after only 2-3 drinks, you will be wondering if someone slipped you a \"mickie\". Potent stuff!  To help off-set the effects of the multiple Mai-Thais.  Their food is absolutely yummy.  While I have not tried everything on their food menu, what I have tried is delish. Food...  [MY top 3] Their Hula Burger with sweet potato fries (that fry sauce they serve with the sweet potato fries is very tasty.)  Or just order the fries an order is large enough to share if you are just looking for something to munch on. - Ceviche - chunks of white fish marinated in citrus juice tossed with cilantro. red bell pepper, chopped tomato...It is served with wonton chips. Great to share but I like to make a light meal out of it.  - Ahi wontons- wonton chips topped with a thin slice of seasoned and seared ahi tuna (it 's rare for those squeamish about their fish) drizzled with a light wasabi aoli of sorts. This, like the ceviche, is good to share or makes a great light meal.  Ahi Poke Salad- chunks of ahi (raw) mixed with avocado and served with wonton chips.  I treat this the same as the last two dishes listed above.   The Scottsdale location is the first place where I tried their Jamaican Johnny Cakes (Side Order = 6 pieces) - the way they do it here,  think of this as a buttery sweet and earthy corn bread. Served warm it accompanies any of their pulled pork or bowls well. I just like it by itself.   Plus it is a great way to soak up a little of the booze and maintain your composure.  Ok that is enough...you probably didn't make it this far down the review or you did, but only after reading the first 3 sentences.",

Mariana was our most gracious server and took very good care of us, even going out of her way to inquire about a boot store for me from another staff.

The only way you would know it's not any other day of the week was the bartender's Santa hat and Christmas lighted beard.  Some Christmas music or island music would have been nice instead of alternative.  Happy hour prices all night was nice and I ordered crispy chicken tacos.  It came with three fried corn shell shredded chicken tacos and black beans on top of rice.  Everything was cooked well, but bland.  The chicken did not have much taste and neither did the beans or rice.  The creme sauce drizzled on the beans and rice at least provided another flavor.  Too bad the same type of crispy chicken taco at Chili's days earlier was 10x better.",

The service was really interactive and relaxed and our server had lots of knowledge on the vast menu. It was hard to pick there were so many tasty options. Added bonus was happy hour until 7pm saturday and sunday.  I was recommended to try hulas for the drink menu and it didn't disappoint! I had the tiki bastard and it was so good! A twist on the traditional mule. Plus the drinks are all served in fun glassware so you feel like your drinking cocktails on the beach. To eat I had the thai chicken bowl which was huge and judging from some of the portions coming from the kitchen they serve big, but really tasty and nice presentation. My friends had the pork tacos and the cheviche and both were delicious, one of the best ceviche I have had in AZ.  Cool place to hang out and enjoy the atmosphere, I would definitely be back to try more!",

    "text": "I've been to the Hula's in downtown Phoenix several times but I only seem to order drinks there and eat someplace else.  I've always loved the atmosphere at Hula's and the cocktails so when the new location opened up in Scottsdale, my friend and I decided to eat dinner there before hitting the town.  The location is great and has a small, very small, private parking lot.  Be weary if you park there about backing out.  Seating was varied with some booth/table set ups, small 2 person tables, bar seating and high top \"communal\" or large group seating.  There were a couple parties going on and it was still comfy for everyone.  What we ordered: - Island Style Poke: about $14 on my bill (market price) with a side of wontons ($1) was just fantastic.  Loved it, almost didn't want to share it with my friend. - Seaweed Salad: $4 - great portion, great dressing, just great.  I will order there every time I'm there from now on. - Blackand Ahi Tuna Sandwhich with a mix of sweet potato fries and standard fries: I could not get enough of this sandwhich.  The bread choice was fantastic.  It was soft enough that made it easy to bite into the Ahi.  The seasoning was great, and the potatoes were perfect.   My friend got the Mango Chicken Caesar Salad:  It was a huge salad, with a chicken breast.  I haven't had blackened chicken in a while, so I was surprised that it was spicy.  Really tasty though, just FYI.  The waiter was attentive and the staff was really nice.  I would definitely come back for dinner again.",

Interesting take on their lobster bisque with Siracha flavor. The ribs were delicious over a bed of sweet potato fries. Portions were very ample as well. We would have given 5 stars but they were out of their Mac n Cheese. Mai Tai was good but very strong - I mean 3 sips into it and I was almost drunk! (Yes, I'm a lightweight but still!) Great place and we would come again!",

She hardly approached us besides to take orders and deliver food, and the wait between delivering food to our table and asking us if we needed our checks took a full hour, and only happened because I ended up approaching the host stand to see where she was. When she came over, she gruffly said, \"I heard you guys were ready to go?\" -- my friends were engaging in a conversation and were laughing as she approached the table, and when she tried getting our attention she looked at our table and said \"I'm sorry, is something funny?\" Rude and discourteous. I don't understand why you work as a server if you genuinely are so rude to your customers.",

Not only did he apologize for my experience he took the time to ask for more details about the service.  I'm impressed at his quick action and willingness to make things right.  I hate to sound like a tough customer, but sometimes speaking out on Yelp is what it takes to make a difference.  With that being said, I will DEFINITELY be back to Hula's.  :)  Thanks Dana!

    "text": "Hula gets a high five in my book and I'll sum up why they do. First of all, they serve brunch on Saturdays and Sundays but that's not even the best part. They also serve all day happy hour on Saturdays and Sundays as well. Technically it's not called \"all day happy hour,\" but they serve it from morning until 7:00 PM. In my mind, that counts as all day! Do you know what this means? $2 mimosas and $5 cocktails. I almost didn't want to give away the brunch secret but since I love Hula's, I decided to share it anyway. The brunch was really good and they have a great Polynesian twist on basic breakfast items. They even offer fried spam for their eggs Benedict. Very random, but I'm almost intrigued to give it a try. Almost. Not only does the brunch menu include breakfast, but it also offers a wide variety of sandwiches and tacos.   Besides weekend brunch, they also have a great lunch and dinner. I've enjoyed both the Polynesian chicken sandwich as well as the steak sandwich. Both were flavorful but I personally like the steak sandwich more because it had a serious kick. I wouldn't get it if you can't handle spice. The chicken sandwich had a delicious teryiaki like sauce. We have also had their crispy shrimp rolls which were a nice way to start the meal. They were tasty but not overly filling. My favorite cocktail? The Painkiller or the Mai Tai. They taste like vacation. All that's missing is the ocean but Scottsdale will just have to work on that harder.   Finally, I really like their chill atmosphere and open environment. It's very fresh and airy with the big sliding doors and the patio (although small) is perfect. Do you have a four-legged friend? The patio is dog friendly!",

We ordered drinks (hurricane and painkiller) and were impressed -- take a sip, close your eyes, and the flavors will transport you to the beach.  For an appetizer we ordered the Hawaiian Ceviche (made with hapu).  Awesome ceviche - the addition of coconut milk was different, but amazing.  I've ordered hapu when in Hawaii, but rarely see it named on a menu here.  I am a fan of its buttery texture and mild flavor, so I was excited to see it as a staple on the menu.  Dinner was a different story.  I ordered the CocoJoe's Chicken Plate.  The chicken was very rubbery.  Had the meat been good, the whole dish would have been awesome, but when the main attraction on the plate is bad... :-(  In hindsight, I should have sent it back.  Instead, I picked at it.  My friend ordered the Shrimp Tacos.  She was drawn in by a word in the description: spicy.  Unfortunately, the dish was absolutely not spicy.  We joked that we should have stopped after our appetizer.  I will give Hula's another try one of these days.  Luau pork or a hapu fish sandwich perhaps... definitely more drinks and ceviche.",

I don't know what is wrong with most yelpers, but if you want to review a restaurant as an actual critic does, you need to not bring expectations along with you.  Too many yelp reviews have been based off of expectations, but those are completely wrong.    Just go dine, take it all in, and then present your review, if needed.  Also, we don't need to hear every single detail of your bun, sauce, taste of the burger, crisp lettuce, blah, blah, blah, blah, BLAH!!!!   We get it!!  You think you're a creative writer!

I mean, really hungry \"I could eat a whole cow\" hungry.  I had high expectations for this place but was not satisfied. I ordered one of the bowls Mongolia beef over rice and salad to go. Waited 15-20 mins for it, plus a small drink and total came to $16 plus tip final bill $20. Walked out and rushed back to the office and savoring the meal and how I'm gonna devour this big plate weighing at least 2 pounds.  I get to the office so excited to kill this plate. I took out the plate, opened it and BOOM! There I counted 4 small pieces of beef and the whole plate filled with chopped salad and lots of rice on the bottom. At this point, I'm thinking...I just spent $20 on food that wont fill me up, drove 10 mins to the place, waited 15-20 mins for the food and another 10 mins back to the office and all I got was 4 lousy SMALL pieces of beef? Come on man, I'm hungry here! (Now annoyed)  Anyways, took me 15 maybe 20 seconds to eat all 4 pieces with some rice and salad and the rest of the 1.7 pounds of rice and salad left(exaggerating) went to the trash.    I was still hungry and went and bought a $4 burrito, no tip, lots of steak in it and filled me right up. So in one day, I spent 1 hour and $24 just to fill myself up for lunch. I think that might be a record in my books. I would try this place again but it will not be anytime soon.    Larry",

Benny with Portuguese Sausage caught my eye. Asked the server if was linguisa? She didn't know. I took my chances ordered it and I am glad I did. Delish! It was linguisa.

The Scottsdale location has a very nice wide open feel and a big bar. Huge doors give a patio feel to everyone when the weather is nice. Food is really good, I love the poke and the luau pork plate. Delicious. I love their MaiTais. Really good and not too sweet. If MaiTais are not your thing there are plenty of other tropical drinks to try. They have some different food and drink specials each night of the week and a solid happy hour. I have been to Hula's five times since they opened and I got great or exceptional service each and every time.",

Unfortunately, we were in a hurry because we had a movie to catch. Our server (Charlie?) was great, we put in our order right away and had our dinner in less than 10 minutes. I had the Cajun Burger, which was cooked a perfect medium rare and delicious, and my BF had the Mongolian Beef Bowl which he enjoyed as well.  We have been back twice since then when we had more time to sit and enjoy our meals!",

The double cranberry mimosas are what we came for and we stayed for the food.  I had the French Toast, of which I'm not usually a fan of, but this came out P.E.R.F.E.C.T.  This is a plate that can be split between two people if you're not ravenous.   I also go to try my friend's ahi, which was so perfect I think about ordering just that sometimes, and I'm not much of fan of fish.  Two people in my group got the eggs benedict and were in heaven. The hostess was the weirdest though.  She didn't seem to actually SEE us when we came in until we actually said something, and getting her to do anything that didn't include having us expressly tell her what she should be doing was like pulling teeth.",

It had perfectly crispy tofu on top of rice, beans and plantains. A great green sauce was on it as well. I also tried the wasabi mashed potatoes, didn't really taste the wasabi though. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was the service was off. The table was dirty when she sat me down even though it was a slow night so there were plenty of other options! It had sauce splashes all over I had to wipe myself because it took some time for the waiter to have time to come over...even though there were maybe only 6 other tables at the time. I'd go again with a group. Vegetarian friendly.",

Food was served hot and fast, and was delicious.   The service was exceptional. We were visited often but not too much. Friendly staff, very observant and polite.

It just so happened that we found ourselves searching for a late night meal in Scottsdale and stumbled into Hula's.  First of all, as a mid century style buff, I loved the whole vibe going on inside. Hawaiian mod style with a few new age touches made for a pretty sweet and swanky setting.   I went with the fried fish bites app and a side of fries. Given the price point of the fish app (~$8-9), i fully expected the portions to be pretty small.. However the fish pieces were huge! My fiance and I both could not come close to finishing them. Not only were the portions impressive for the price, but they tasted amazing! You could tell that they had just been battered and fried minutes beforehand. The side of fries were also just out of the deep fryer and were super yummy.  My fiance went with the Jawaian Jerk Chicken plate which he said was quite possibly the best meal he's had since we moved to Arizona 6 months ago. I tried bites of the chicken and Johnny cakes and wow, I have to agree!   Service was great, ambience was awesome, and the food was outstanding.. Can't wait to return!",

Long colorful straws in a decorative bowl (with a flame) mixed with good company is always a winner. :)  There is a brunch available at Hulas on the weekend, which I have had several times with a couple mimosas and very tasteful.

In my opinion, Hulas serves THE BEST mai-tai - even better than Trader Vic's, which purportedly invented the recipe. And at $6 during happy hour, there is no better price deal to be found.

We had mai tai's and 'Painkillers'. The Mai tai was Close to what we have had in Hawaii. It wasn't the same, but closer to the flavor than others we have tried.  The sweet potato fries were crisp and has a great dipping sauce. We also tried the pork sliders and they tasted good. All in all a good value for the price. It was also nice to see they had the Maui brewing co beers on tap.   What I was most excited about is the crowd. It was a more mature crowd with people in their 30's to 50's. I'm glad it wasn't the typical younger party crowd you find in old town. It was busy but wasn't loud or obnoxious.   We will defiantly be back... on a Wednesday night.",

    "text": "Coconut shrimp rolls were yummy.  Especially the pineapple horseradish dipping sauce.   The spicy thai chicken bowl was room temp, I think it may have been due to the sauce squirted on top.  The bowl had an over abundance of rice so if you are a white rice eater this bowl is for you.   The avocado on this bowl was not very fresh.  It was already browned an bruised and didn't look very appealing, but it didn't taste bad.  The two slices of sweet plantains were really good.  Overall the bowl lacked taste and was not spicy at all so don't let the name deter you it was pretty bland.  My husband ordered the  Loco Moco which is a hamburger patty covered in mushroom gravy on top of white rice with two sunny side up eggs on top.  It was pretty, hamburger was medium rare at best so if you want done more than that be sure to specify (because we weren't asked). He said it was ok but lacked seasoning.  I do not like rare meat or eggs so I passed on trying it.  Friendly service.  Not very busy, has a full bar and ample parking.",

I came last night (Wednesday is All Night Happy Hour) and had spicy edamame (best I've ever had), dark & stormy cocktail and the ceviche. Everything was so good, but the ceviche wasn't my favorite, but I ate it all because it didn't lack flavor. I decided to come back for lunch today. Spicy edamame AGAIN, dark & stormy AGAIN, and the ahi poke (so delicious). Within walking distance of my hotel, so it is absolutely perfect. Staff is great too, although the bartender last night seemed more concerned about chatting with friends/regulars than taking care of the rest of his bar, but overall nothing to complain about.",

Deets on the eats:  -Pink Bikini Martini: tasted like a watermelon jolly rancher! It was sweet and tangy, but I definitely could not have had more than one (probably a good thing!)   -Mai Tai: My boyfriend ordered this drink. It was a bit too strong for my tastes but he really enjoyed it.   -Ceviche: Really tasty! The fish is nice and fresh and comes served with crispy wonton chips. The citrus in the dish was a nice touch but I think it could have been toned down just a tad.   -Mongolian Beef Bowl: Great flavor! The bowl comes with grilled beef, black beans, rice, shredded cabbage and a lime curry sauce. My one complaint is that it's served in a huge bowl that's 75% cabbage. I have had this dish once for takeout and it seemed way more proportional. In the restaurant, there was just a few bites of beef and I wanted a bit more as it was so tasty!  -Duke's Pork Luau Plate: this dish features pineapple pulled pork with a soy glaze, rice, and coleslaw. Super flavorful!   Our server was very attentive and the food came out very promptly. I will definitely be back to try more from their extensive menu.",

We got the chicken satay with peanut sauce for a starter. That was really good! Peanut sauce was seasoned just right and a perfect addition to the satay.   For our meals, I got the Hangover Hash & my date got the French toast. The French toast was delicious, it came with apples and plantain and a side of bacon. The hangover hash had pulled pork, shredded potato hash, and two sunny side up eggs. The hangover hash was just alright, pull pork was juicy and perfectly cooked but definitely lacking flavor. Dish was bland to say the least. They did try to season it with onions and red peppers but had to add bbq sauce and sriracha to make it taste good. But once I added that it tasted amazing!   For drinks I had the tropical itch and my date had the Mai Thai. The Mai Thai was sooo good! The tropical itch is good if you want something really sweet and not too strong.   I would come back another time to try other things though.",

I chose the snapper, prepared with macadamia encrusted. I was impressed. It was a very decent sized piece of fish, plus the slaw that came with it was unique and delicious. I can't say anything stellar about the side of rice. I guess I sorta would have liked to see something more special, granted rice seems to be a good pairing for this type of dish. The atmosphere, drinks, and apps were all great as well. I would recommend stopping by here if you're in town!",

Big, perfectly prepared, on a fresh, soft ciabatta bun. Delicious! Sweet potato fries, and a nice green salad came with.  Took half the burger and fries home for breakfast.  Splurged on dessert, their sundae. Quality vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup and crushed macadamia nuts. What a treat.  Nice atmosphere, would enjoy bringing friends.

The rice served on the side was sticky but not pasty and the coleslaw (not cream based) had a mild flavor.  I preferred the fruity salsa with my rice rather than on top of the fish. Added flavor to the rice and but kept the crust on the fish crispy. The lilikoi margarita was tasty as well. There's a bit of OJ in it so it has a \"bite\" to it. All in all a good place to check out with lots of Hawaiian style items on the menu. Hoping to visit again!!",

If you like thick calamari with less batter, this is for you. Pork and ahi tacos were very fresh and a great taste combo. A bit spicy and a bit sweet. The best part?  Homemade coconut cream pie. Lots of fresh coconut and a creamy taste. Would visit again.",

In all occasions, I've had a wonderful time!   On Wednesdays, they have HH pricing all night long! So really, you're getting chill bar prices, with a more upscale, dining restaurant vibe.   In my several visits, I've tried their potstickers, their fries, chicken wings, and the Hula Burger - all wonderful!   The Hula's Hurricane is really refreshing...dangerously refreshing, and the house margarita is delicious as well. You really feel like you're getting your money's worth with their quality.",

We also ordered the crunchy spicy chicken tacos, which weren't very spicy, but I understand some don't like things as spicy as others...I suggest kicking it up a notch!

From what I could tell, this location is much less \"themed\" which is kind of a bummer, but we still got umbrella's in every drink which made me a happy little bar hopper.  We didn't try any food but the drinks we're all very strong and tasty.  One mai tai was enough for this little one, 2 would've sent me dancing across the street at Pattie's.

The staff is always, always friendly! I have gotten the bowls here in the past  they are delicious and very filling! We started with the Crunchy shrimp roll and spicy fish cakes. Both were great starters. I love the mango puree sauce that comes with the shrimp rolls! Tonight I got the kalbi rib. They were cooked just right and full of flavor! My husband got the pork tacos which were cooked and seasoned to perfection! Our friend got the jawaiian pork plate- it was tender and had a nice kick. You can't leave here until you've had their key lime pie! Perfect combo of tart and sweet. It was a drive, but worth it. Tyler took great care of us. We will definitely be back!",

The restaurant wasn't nearly as busy as some of the surround restaurants, and when we walked in the waitress (without acknowledging us at all) placed us at the table. We had plenty of time to review the menu before I stated to noticed that two couples that had been seated after us had already been waited on. Multiple staff members walked past our tables as we had now clearly folded up our menus and were now ready to order. We weren't even offered water!!! After sitting for 20 minutes at the table, clearly looking around for someone to at least take our drink order, we left.  What upset me the most was the hostess. The hostess stand has a bar directly behind it where she was rolling napkins with tableware and has visibility to all of the tables. She just stood there and watched us be ignored. Multiple wait staff approached her to ask questions and she never directed anyone to assist us. I get it, maybe none of them were supposed to wait on our table, but lady you sat us there. Why had you not checked to see why we weren't waited on? I'm incredible offended being blatantly ignored. So save yourself the trip and the Scottsdale attitudes and go someone actually worth your time.",

I think the edamame could use a BIT of tweaking.  The group all looked very happy with the entrees ordered.  I ordered a green jungle curry bowl, really good kick of spice, which I appreciated.  I don't believe in bland! I'm not a dessert person but they do have homemade desserts I was told by the cutie server girl.

    "text": "Charlie....... you rock!   Charlie is a great server, and I have to say that again. You rock! He took care of an ENTIRE large birthday party and still was prompt and attentive to us. The thing that really stood out for me with him was that he was communicative. If more people were communicative in general, I think people would be a lot more understanding and patient.   Anywho, the first thing Charlie said was that he had a large birthday party and he was going to take their orders but he would be right back to us. Understood. When he came back, I told him that was quick and he said that he felt that he took forever..and that well it was just a matter of perception which to me meant that Charlie had his guests in mind.   Okay onward with the food...   Hula's Modern Tiki is located right in Old Town Scottsdale ...and is just what it sounds like. Hawaiian food with a modern twist.   I ordered the Jawaiian Jerk Pulled Pork Entree, which came with rice, pulled pork, plantain and \"Johnny Cakes,\"   The entree came automatically split in two plates, since we were sharing and I appreciated that the kitchen did that, probably at the direction of Charlie, without even asking. Thank you! The plates were also presentable.   The pulled pork was fantastically seasoned and oh boyyyyy a kick of spice! If you don't like spicy, this WILL NOT be for you. The spice lingers, but is absolutely delicious. The fried plantain was what I expected, and the Johnny Cakes was delicious as well ...it was like a corn cake with plantains.   We also ordered a side of Mac Salad and that was also reasonably priced ($3) and well worth it. It does come cold, which reminds of the modern mac salad you get from the grocery store rather than the warm ones you get a Hawaiian place, but it was still very tasty and rather light and refreshing.   Enjoyed my experience here!",

That alone made it great, but wait there's more! The food is so good! Fries to die for, of course the shrimp coconut crispy rolls, little pieces of fish (so delicious) and on & on. I will be back, I so enjoyed everything, wonderful spirit of the people and decor.  I hear it gets loud later but if your there around happy hour it's fine.",

When I lived in San Francisco unlimited mimosa brunches on the weekends were all over the place & I was a little disappointed that they were far and few in between in the Phoenix area when I moved back here (although in the 3+ years I've been back they've been popping up more). Technically, at $2 each Hula's doesn't do an \"unlimited\" mimosa deal, but it's just as good (if not better).   The brunch food menu is pretty solid. The first time I came I had the pork breakfast hash, and it was tasty. Last time I was here I had the omelette (which changes regularly). The time I ordered it, it had chicken & avocado (and a few other things), and it was tasty. This place is also pretty affordable. Most brunch items are around $10 and the portions are pretty good size. Both times I was here the service was good.   The regular Happy Hour & dinner menu look good as well, and they have some pretty fun looking tropical drinks.   I'll be back!",

    "text": "(Lyrics - Sam Smith - I'm Not The Only One)  Yelp and me, we made a vow For better or for worse I know you wouldn't let me down But the proof's in the way it taste For months on end I've had no doubts  Eating everywhere I wish I could come over now But I know that you'll be there  I say I'm hungry Cause Scottsdale just around the corner But when is Happy Hour I go to Hula's Modern Tiki!  Hula's Modern Tiki Scottsdale is a 2nd location to the popular Tiki off Central in Phoenix.  Overall, Hula's Modern Tiki still the same concept and design; a 50's style luau with a modern twist in drinks and food.  I came on a late Tuesday night to catch the game and hang with a buddy of mines from Los Angeles.  He was flabbergasted by the prices, \"They're so cheap compared to where I'm from\", Yes I agreed.  Plus, we have water and I'm sure glad I don't have to over pay for food here in the valley!    Hula has daily Happy Hour specials so check them out, but tonight I shot for a IPA and ordered the Habanero Chicken Tacos while my buddy went for the Loco Moco.  My dish was pretty darn spicy and I'm sure they used just a tad bit of habanero, but it worked with marinated shredded chicken while the crunchy cabbage slaw provided some texture.  The avocado is always a welcome and the sweet aioli balanced it out pretty well.  I didn't even use my salsa since I thought the dish was well put together.  Only thing was I didn't care for the corn tortilla since it was definitely store bought; I rather have it freshly made and would have made this dish kickass!  My buddies dish was a \"traditional\" Hawaiian meal.  To me it was a Salisbury hamburger patty atop a bed of rice and a fried egg over everything.  He rather enjoyed it, but I didn't really care for it.    In the end. Hula's is still a hot spot for Happy Hour whether in Phoenix or Scottsdale.  The food is a fusion of Hawaiian and Southwest with some modern American funk.  Service is pretty good and overall and solid spot! - Enjoy!",

I cant comment on the drinks because nobody in our party got one except the ginger ale which is a \"house blend\" likely a Coke and Sprite mix. My sister was also kinda grossed out at the waitress sampling it with a straw although I explained that was a common practice among bartenders. LOL!  Now let me get to the food. It was pretty delicious. The plantains, one of my favorite side dishes, were cooked to perfection. I had the pulled pork sandwich which was also super tasty. This establishment brands itself as a Hawaiian-Jamaican fusion restaurant and it's definitely that. The jerk chicken plate ordered by a friend had just the right amount of spice and portions were generous. Other dishes ordered were the mango chicken salad, the bean burger, the ribs and the wings. Everyone enjoyed their meals and the prices didn't break the bank.   The service was decent, our waitress wasn't as attentive as I would've liked. Thankfully her colleagues picked up the slack refilling waters and getting other requested items to us in a reasonably timely manner.",

    "text": "Definitely not when I expected for a Tiki place.   From first glance, Hula's seems just like another regular \"modern\" restaurant. However if you want Tiki Drinks, you definitely came to the right place. Me and buddy came here after a late brunch and decided to get some more drinks. The bartender saw us and greeted us right away.  I was very undecided on what I wanted to order which is very rare when it comes to Tiki drinks. I asked the bartender basically what the strongest tiki drink there was and he recommended an their hula Mai Tai. I was surprised until I took a couple sips. Wow..It was definitely boozey but it had the perfect balance of flavor with alcohol. It was just while I needed! Meanwhile my buddy ordered the Bastard and he was enjoying his just as much as mine. I had a sip and definitely enjoyed the complexity of the Whiskey with the Gin.   If I come back to Arizona and want a quick Tiki drink, I'll definitely think about this place. I'd really be interested to try their food the next time too!",

I ordered the Dr. Funk for my beverage (vodka, rum, banana, pineapple & OJ - fruity and delicious), and the kalbi ribs for my meal. The plate was huuuge, with three pieces of ribs, giant macaroni mac salad, and rice. The sauce was a little too sweet for my liking, but it was overall a tasty dish.   Service was pretty lame. It took a little while for anyone to acknowledge and seat us, and our server definitely did not want to be there.   Three stars pretty much sums it up!",

I really love the themed glassware and the fruits and flavors that combined in to the presentation. The drinks weren't so strong that I felt drunk after consuming 2 in about an hour.  I love the atmosphere of Hula's, it's a fun place for both adults and those closer to 21. They also have a selection of food to eat while enjoying drinks at the bar. There isn't a ton of seating, but it was not very busy on a Monday evening, and we were sat right away. I would definitely recommend Hula's for a parents night out, bachelorette party, or drinks with friends!",

I immediately liked the lively vibe of the restaurant and the welcoming attitude of the hostess. Tyler was our server -- and he had great recommendations all around! I had the Mai Thai and Blood Orange Martini (would strongly recommend the martini) for drinks. For apps we had the calamari (it doesn't look like your usual order, more like steak cuts) and the spicy edamame (we enjoyed the heat). Then for entrees we got the jerk pork (not like Jamaican jerk) - mom said the meat was shredded a little too finely and was a tad mushy (she's also Jamaican and it didn't taste as she expected). I had the poke bowl - it had a little too much soy sauce on it, but I like poke bowls, so oh well - with a seaweed salad on the side as my main dish. I would definitely come again.",

It has a clean, open design that lends itself to a more modern feel which seemed misaligned with its Tiki theme but was still nice overall.  Regardless, the drinks were really great and, for most of us, the food was almost as good.  We had almost half the drinks on the specialties list (no judgments, please) with the best being the Dr. Funk and Hula's Mai Tai.  We ordered both the chicken wings and steak skewer appetizers and both were really great with the wings being the better of the two.  My colleagues got the BBQ ribs and the Korean Ribs and they were both great. I was told by those that ate them that the Luau Pork Plate and the Steak Sandwich were good. Unfortunately, the same could not be said of my Loco Moco as it was disappointing.  It's flavor was bland and I suspect it was due to the mild tasting gravy.  Overall, I would recommend Hula's as a worthwhile place to stop by for a bite and drink but they have some room for improvement with their food.",

I had a squid sandwich: it was substantial. One friend had a chicken sandwich which he enjoyed. The other had a dish of rice and hamburger patty which could have had egg on it.  My wife had shrimp tacos. We split a side of sweet potato fries.  We were all happy with our lunch. Each couple split a coconut cream pie dessert. My wife and I had tropical drinks which were pretty good. Everything was reasonably priced.  Service was excellent. Of course, when there are only four tables in use (not counting some day drinkers), a waiter can handle things. In any case we were all pleased we tried this place.  It was recommended by a friend's son and it was a good recommendation.  Unfortunately, the music in the background was a little loud and somewhat obnoxious.",

There are a couple of kinks still to work out, but I am sure they will take care of it.  We went for the grand opening, we sat at a communal table with several friends.  I was having such a fun time that I missed the ribbon cutting ceremony.  My first drink was the Dr. Funk, very fruity and rummy.  I think it could be dangerous, because I was downing it pretty fast.  My second one was the One Eye Pyrat, I love ginger beer, so I wanted to try it.  That one was good, but I liked my first drink better. To eat we had the Ahi Tuna Wontons, Pork Tacos and Johnny cakes.  Everything was really good.  We never got our sweet potato fries, but they took them off the bill.  It was a pretty confusing table, so I don't blame our server Charlie, he was trying to take care of a table of over 12 people.  I already know what I am getting next, can't wait to be back.",

For dinner we both ordered Ahi Tuna Sandwiches-- which I was sadly disappointed in. The Ahi Tuna was tough with a lot of tendons.. I could barely eat it, honestly. Sad because on my previous visit I ordered the Ahi Tacos, and they were delicious. For $15 for an Ahi Tuna Sandwich, I would expect a better cut of Tuna. My husband wasn't quite as offended about it and he loved his sandwich. I will definitely be back-- the appetizer, drinks, and ambience won me over even if the meal wasn't quite right.",

    "text": "I've been to Hula's a couple of times now and am definitely a fan so I figured I'd write a review.  Pros- Really good food, I recommend the Baja Fish Tacos, and the black bean burger- which is quite possibly one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had! I've been here for brunch too and everything is delicious and Hawaiian themed (cute). Also, GREAT cocktails! I came here yesterday for an event and ordered the Blood Orange Martini, YUM! My friend got the Painkiller and that was amazing too.   Cons- Okay so issue number one, it's sort of a weird layout. Near the bar they have two long tables that are parallel to the bar and even though it makes the space look modern and contemporary, I can't help but feel like it's such a waste of space. I get why they have them, for larger groups, but why not connect the booth's that are toward the front? I don't know, but I felt it worth mentioning since everytime I go here with a different person they say the same thing so it must just feel odd to all. Then again, I majored in design as did many of my friends so perhaps we're more sensitive to it then others. Again, this isn't that big of a deal because at the end of the day the food is great so who cares.   Issue number two- okay, how do I say this without sounding like a bitch? Hmm can't. Can the front desk girls please put on real pants? Seriously! Yesterday I saw a girl wearing worn-out yoga clothes and thought \"Really? Who goes to a place like this from Yoga. That's sorta gross.\" Then to my horror I realized the girl actually worked there. WOW. Unlike the layout, you might want to re-think this one, Hula. You're too classy and cool of a place to allow workers to be greeting guests in what could pass as pajamas. Like seriously, bikinis would be less offensive at least that's in line with the theme.   But again, I come here often and really like it. Those are just my humble suggestions to make this place even better.",

My friend and I went for lunch and we were pleased that they had their own parking lot (albeit small) and we were surprised that the interior was classy (whereas we were expecting uber casual beachy). Service was prompt and friendly and it was only a matter of time before our lunches arrived - Caesar salad with shrimp rolls and a Polynesian chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries.  The Caesar dressing is amazing so I would recommend any of the Caesar salads here.  The Polynesian chicken sandwich was excellent but definitely a little messy so if you are at Hulas on a first date or lunch interview I would skip it.  :-).  For visitors from colder parts of the country, I can see where they would really enjoy the garage doors that roll up for access to the small outdoor patio and to welcome Sonoran breezes.  Not only is the food good here but the atmosphere is great too.  If you are fortunate enough to be there when the weather is ideal it's reminiscent of a San Diegan or Hawaiian ocean front burger stand.",

For meat eaters, the tacos are great as is the burgers, but my favorite is the Ahi caesar  salad.

Just get there early - Inventive takes on drinks - Really enjoyed the casual, yet modern atmosphere  Negatives:  - They still weren't taking reservations unless it was for a party of 8 or larger. The hostess did us a favor and allowed us to make a reservation for 6. Even though it was for 8:30, we definitely would've had to wait for at least 15 minutes if we didn't make that reservation...so this policy doesn't make sense - Our server either forgot orders or mixed up orders twice. But she was really nice and seemed to be trying her hardest on a busy weekend  - Tahiti lager; would not recommend - Things were a bit more expensive than I anticipated when portion size was taken into account",

I crave it all the time! It comes with an amazing lime-ginger cream sauce that compliments the calamari perfectly.   Their brunch menu is also fantastic, I recommend the Hangover Hash, which if you do actually have a hangover, works magic. Otherwise it's just plain delicious.

We also tried the ceviche, fish tacos, and the fish cakes: all delicious. I have mixed reviews on the drinks: my drink tasted like plain/bland fruit punch (couldn't taste any rum), while my friend's drink was way too strong (she actually had to return the drink to get it fixed.) At least the margaritas were okay.",

We decided to try out this place and immediately walking into this restaurant we right away sensed a horrible vibe. The floors were flooded because of the rain (which I slightly understood) so we were only to sit in a specific area. We weren't greeted for a good 5 minutes and when the server did greet us, she seemed mad for whatever reason and we actually had 3 different servers which is annoying and only one server (the manager) actually helped us. The sad part is that I loved my food but my boyfriend didn't enjoy his. He ordered chicken tacos I believe I'm not too sure about the name but his had bones in it which is disgusting and unfortunately the cons out way the pros and we will never be coming back due to our horrible customer service.",

    "text": "Scottsdale Location  My wife and I are big fans of your Central location, so when your Scottsdale location opened up, we've been anxiously awaiting an opportunity to come in. That occasion came about yesterday, when we brought our two daughters (2 & 3) and my in-laws for dinner.   First, let me start by saying that the kids were relatively well behaved...so I don't think that had any impact on our experience and/or treatment at all.   When we first arrived, we were greeted by a hostess who seemed like she barely had a pulse. She seemed almost annoyed that she had to seat us, instead of warmly greeting us and showing us to our seats (you know...like what a hostess does?). Upon leaving for the evening, she was off talking to some obvious friends who were seated at a nearby table, rather than at her station thanking us for coming in.  Our waitress disappeared for large chunks of time throughout the evening, and we had to ask for more water, a side of dressing (which never arrived), or a second round of drinks (which we didn't order...because she never came back again until she brought the bill). We saw her over by the bar several times throughout the night conversing with one of the bartenders (mind you...it wasn't busy, and nobody appeared to be making any drinks).  Atmosphere was great...and the food of course is delicious...but man, can you guys revisit customer service with your staff? I felt embarrassed for my in-laws, and felt uncomfortable that I put them through that experience.",

Again, not a big deal since we didn't have a reservation on a Friday night.   The menu has a great selection to choose from. I decided that evening to try the Duke's Luau Pork Plate, it was really good, the pork was at least...the slaw, not so much. I also ordered for the table Jamaican Johnny Cakes, though the side was only $3.00, I suggest you keep your money in your wallet. Very bland. No butter, or honey or anything to put on top of it, so we just left those bad boys on the plate after trying them.  Like the other reviews said, you won't find a ton of Hawaiian themed items throughout the restaurant.....hence the modern in the restaurants name but still a hip place to go and have a little Hawaiian infused meal.",

They have a full bar and you can order munchies or a meal at the bar, or get a table (or patio table and watch the people of Old Town walk by).   I've only had drinks and apps the several times I've been here, and both were quite good!  They make a good cocktail and have a great happy hour...with a rush, so be aware it can fill up!

Food was room temperature not warm or hot like it just came out of the oven or grill. Ribs was flavorful and BBQ sauce was on the sweet side. Wife ordered the jawaiian jerk chicken.

Easy street parking, small private lot, or a structure a couple blocks away. The restaurant has such a fun, young and hip vibe. The cuisine has a Asian-Hawaiian flair. Awesome happy hour with a lot of tropical Hawaiian mixed drinks and appetizers. (Blood orange martini on the rocks is highly suggested)  Our waiter Jharnys was THE BEST! He was so inviting and friendly.. he gave honest suggestions on the menu while still being tactful and personable.   We ordered calamari as an appetizer. This was such a unique way to serve calamari but was pleasantly surprised. As entrees: spicy seaweed salad, pork stuffed potstickers, hapu blackened wasabi fish, steak tacos... ALL were amazing. We cleaned every plate. There were zero complaints. To finish it off we capped this great meal with the delicious key lime pie. Wow it seems like you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!",

    "text": "Finally back to try some food and had good results on a recent weekend evening. I don't eat fish tacos, but these were reported to be the best ever. My HULU burger was 11 bucks and had that Hulu sauce, which isn't that impressive enough to be doused on my burger. The burger in general was a good slab of meat on a soft roll with some grilled onions. Side Dishes dragged the rating down. Sweet Potato Fries - limp, not good Rice - Overcooked, clumpy, unknown white sauce HULU sauce - very bland, needs a new recipe with a Hawaiian twist,  The Drinks at 7 bucks each were tasty. Dr. Funk was a good choice. They had one TV set on the ASU game, but none of the 30 people (except me) were watching. Ok, it's not a sports bar, but a decent time. Although I wonder why the burger costs $2 more at dinner when nothing on that burger has changed except the time of day it was served.",

We all wanted to try something So we decided to check this place out. The atmosphere was great. It was a Sunday night so it wasn't busy at all. Didn't have to wait for a table which was nice. Would have been nice to have more patio space but still really liked the atmosphere inside.   The food was great. I was the only one of 4 who didn't really care for the dish but it was more of a preference thing than flavor. I ordered the Mongolian beef w/out the black beans and cabbage. (Ordered that the first time I visited and didn't like the black beans or cabbage so I asked them to hold both). The other three plates in the table were the loco moco (included in photos), the pork platter, and the Jamaican jerk chicken. All of which were absolutely amazing. Great portion sizes, and good rice, and overall great flavor. They also have a pretty lengthy spirit menu to choose from. And the food menu is also full of variety.   The service mediocre at best. We politely asked our server to switch tables, not thinking anything of it. Our server seemed put out. We didn't really understand why seeing as though the restaurant was nearly empty. He reluctantly agreed and placed us at a table nearby. When he brought out the checks, we only had two. One for my girlfriend and I, and one for the other couple we were with. Now I will say it was convenient for him to assume that we were on a double date. However, I don't think it was very appropriate. I don't think that should be assumed. It should be asked of by the guest. A simple \"how would you like the bill?\" Would have been much more appropriate. Food 5/5. Service 3/5. Total 4/5.",

They do it every they can to not accommodate you for their happy hour pricing and then I was cut off after 1 drink. Ronnie,The general manager is the person to blame regarding any sort of mishaps with my bill and with my service at this horrible location. I would be so embarrassed if I own this place or if I manage this place. I spend money to dine in nice places and to be served by proper servers however hula in Scottsdale does not have this going on. I was there on Thursday and I was there tonight on Saturday, July 4 Independence Day, and have never received such poor service or disrespect by general manager And a bar manager both times. Aside from your employees stealing and serving undercooked food that gets people sick I hope your location allows you to last more than a few months. I've never been so disrespected at a restaurant and have no problem telling every single person I know that Hula treats people like shit. I am personally saying Ronnie is to blame. I hope the owner of the restaurant called me to apologize for his lack of intuition when hiring a general manager. By the way the pork is generally undercooked and has made a few people I know come home with food poisoning. Thank you Hula in Scottsdale for being such a disrespectful.dirty place to dine while being treated like shit. Again Ronnie is to blame.",

It is very island hip casual, if that makes sense.  I love that there is one wall that completely opens up to the outside.  That has been particularly nice during this mild winter that we've been having.  Second, they have a great happy hour.  It goes until 7 every day.  My favorite are the mai tais.  Usually I am not a huge fan of mai tais, but these are special.  They are not the usual fruit-punch-red, sugary concoctions you get beachside.  No, they are not...but, I have a hard time describing them.  I'll just say they are delicious, and they definitely pack a punch.  Third, almost everything I've eaten there has been great.  The two things that stick out in my mind are the poke and the hapu with lemongrass sauce.  The poke was extremely fresh and flavorful.  Sometimes raw fish dishes are too salty for me, but this was perfect.  My boyfriend ordered the hapu and chose to get it with lemongrass sauce.  It was one of the best fish dishes I've ever had.  Even with a cream sauce, it was relatively light and just really different.  I ordered the butterfish and had it pan fried, and I should have known it would be too much.  It was tasty, but it was just too rich and definitely on the salty side.  I've also had the sweet potato fries, lobster bisque, potstickers, and the crispy coconut shrimp rolls.  I enjoyed all of those except the potstickers, which were too thick and fairly bland.  Finally, the service has generally been good.  The one night I went for dinner rather than happy hour, the service was excellent.  I will be going back to Hula's as soon as possible!",

We were seated very quickly and arrived just in the nick of time to find the restaurant quickly filled up. It is laid out very well to accommodate all sizes of parties. We had the Hawaiian Ceviche which was refreshing and filling. We previously tried the Lobster Bisque which was divine. This time we also had the Fried fish cakes, which were crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle. He had the fried calamari sandwich and I tried the Baja Fish tacos. The Calamari sandwich was amazing. Thin strips were lightly battered and fried, then topped with French dressing and cole slaw. The bun was sturdy enough to hold everything in place and the calamari was very soft and tender. I couldn't believe that it was calamari. I never had a great desire for it because most of the time it is too rubbery and chewy. Not this one! I highly recommend it! The fish tacos were good, 3 of them on corn tortillas with sliced avocado and rice and beans. The rice and beans were nothing special but the tacos filled us up. I would definitely  go back for the Calamari sandwich and to try some other items on the menu. Also, try the Lilikoi Margarita...it is a perfect balance of sweet and sour and half price during happy hour.",

When the hostess sat us, she informed us lunch prices would be ending in 15 minutes, so we should hurry up and order from the lunch menu if we wanted to. My friend and I ordered a $2 mimosa (before they ended at 3:30 also), and our waiter said mimosas ended at 3:30. My friend said it was only 3:15 and asked what the problem was, like why couldn't we get one if we still had 15 minutes. The waiter reluctantly agreed and came back with our drinks. I ordered one taco from the lunch menu (not a huge appetite and good prices, so why not?) and again the waiter gave us so much attitude and it wasn't even 3:30 yet! I have no idea what his deal was, and again the hostess told us to hurry up and order before 3:30. He probably was hoping we'd order from the dinner menu and regular drink prices to up his tip. My taco was good, but the side of rice/beans was pretty cold and dry. I was the one who recommended Hula's to my friends, but it didn't live up to prior expectation!",

I started with the Painkiller for a cocktail, which was absolutely delicious. I also had the Market Ahi Sashimi for an appetizer which was also delicious. Perfect texture and was very fresh. But then when I went to the main entree, my experience kind of changed. I ordered the loco moco. I have had some really good Hawaiian dishes, so I would like to say that I have a good taste for Hawaiian food, but the loco moco was NOT good. The patty had absolutely no flavor, and the so-called mushroom gravy was way too salty. But it did have a good atmosphere and good drinks and appetizers, so my boyfriend and I decided we should go there again and try out their breakfast. The following day my boyfriend and I went for brunch. I started with a bloody mary, and it was great!!! I also ordered the Crispy Coconut Shrimp rolls as an appetizer. They had unique flavor at first, but then when I started to get into it, they did not taste so good. Almost too unique of a flavor for such a simple dish. Then I ordered another bloody mary, it was awful! Basically pure vodka. So then I asked the waitress can I please get this remade. She took it and came back and said he just put it in this glass and added mix to it.... I was like okay.... I'm pretty sure you are not supposed to tell the customer that and I'm pretty sure when a customer asks you to have it remade it means REMADE. I slowly started not liking the place after that... Then I ordered the Portuguese sausage benedict... Again, I know my benedicts and this one was not good. I rated this place with 3 stars because it has good intentions and good dishes, but needs to change around the menu a bit for it to be entirely successful.",

The atmosphere is fun and the servers are friendly. Happy hour pricing is awesome. What more could someone ask for? The only thing I would change would be better chairs. These ones aren't comfy. But overall check it out",

I had the shrimp tacos which were SO good and my husband got one chicken and one fish. He liked them both. Our bartender was super great too. Fun to talk to and gave us a couple suggestions. Try this place out if you haven't already!",

And I can tell you with all certainty that Hula's Modern Tiki may be located in Scottsdale, but its heart and soul is in Hawaii!   I popped in on my own while the \"men folk\" were out swinging metal clubs at tiny balls in the searing Arizona sun; so I sat up at the bar (which is always the right choice when you are on your own.) The bartender was super friendly and so terrific. She made some recommendations, we chatted wine, she even let me sample the utterly terrible pineapple wine (lol, seriously, it's not good - sorry Hawaii) but it is fun to try!  They have a great menu with lots of fun Island-life staples like poke, mahi, hapu, and ahi. There are bowls, burger and sandwiches and of course tacos (this is still AZ!) and even a dish in tribute to Duke. I decided to get the Polynesian chicken sammie that came with grilled chicken with a light teriyaki glaze topped with spiced pineapple and sun-dried tomato pesto aioli. It was aaaaah-mazing! And to take it to the next level (and I HIGHLY recommend doing this), I subbed my fries for fried sweet plantains. So good!! All this paired with a traditional Hawaiian cocktail like a Dark & Stormy or Mai Tai, and you will swear you can hear the waves crashing on a nearby shore... Honestly, the only thing missing is the beach. Mahalo!",

This does not stop us from eating in some of the wonderful restaurants in our area.  Case in point, we arrived at Hula and parked in a disabled parking spot and then couldn't find a way into the restaurant until a server came out and she removed lots of large rocks sitting on a couple of tarps blocking the opening to the restaurant's rear door.  What a lovely person she is!  I'm so glad we were able to get in because the food was excellent.  It was 2pm on a Tuesday and only two tables were occupied.  A good looking bar and table area greeted our senses.  We ordered sandwiches, made so well you hated to rip into them with bared teeth.  I had a blackened sea bass [HAPU] sandwich with taco slaw and sun-dried tomato pesto aioli, and the wife had a fried calamari steak strips sandwich with the same condiments.  The best and freshest tasting seafood, perfectly prepared were trapped between the 2 wonderful halves of a freshly baked large roll.  Also ordered a side of french fries, crispy on the outside, and tender inside.  Cooked the way they should be cooked or should I say fried. We had an epicurean and delightful moment orally shredding these tasty morsels.  Service was spot on despite the energy consumed by moving many mini boulders :).  We shall return to try the many wonderful items on their menu.  What a hidden gem.  If you like fresh seafood or just well prepared meals, this is the place!  On the way out we were shown the correct way out by using the sidewalk out front.  Too bad our server didn't know and had to work so hard but I love her for it.  Here are the menus : <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhulasmoderntiki.com%2Fmenu%2Flunch%2F&s=f8dae0cb00eee787ca029bee6f6f9e35b648467ec47c3ef06bd15df61df07ee0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">hulasmoderntiki.com/menu...</a>",

The server was not friendly, never smiled and wouldn't or couldn't offer any recommendations that were helpful. The two different drinks I had off the menu were light on the liquor and heavy on the sugar - even though I requested all the sugar/simple syrup to be removed. The food was incredibly bland. I had the shrimp tacos - the shrimp were dry and flavorless, the tortilla was soggy and tasted like flour. Besides the tiki head at the entrance, there is nothing tiki about this place. NOTE: I dined at this restaurant in June 2015 (not September when I posted the review)",

It came as a side with one of their fish taco choices. The fish tacos were as expected but really the coconut rice and black beans should be a main dish. Like seriously.   Now that we've got that out of the way, let's talk about the rest of this restaurant. It's really swanky-trendy-cool in here. Literally what you think in your mind when you think tiki lounge with a modern twist. So they've got that right!   Lots of choices and flavors, got that right too! Great drinks, yup, that too! We decided to go with their Tuesday deal, 2 appetizers and 2 cocktails for $20, plus a couple extra appetizers since we were all sharing.The ceviche and poke were the standouts, in my opinion and I really loved my blood orange martini!   Above all, their service was great! Everyone from the host to the multiple people that helped us out were incredible! There were a couple spills at the table next to us and instead of getting too over excited or frustrated the staff just seamlessly helped them clean it all up. It was awesome! I've had to work as a server/host so I definitely know how it is with drinks/hot food/birthdays/big groups. It can be a mess sometimes, but this place handles it soooo well!   My only regret is that I didn't order a drink that came in one of their cute tiki cups!",

The hostess was a little standoffish, so I initially felt that I might have made a mistake walking into this super trendy restaurant that looked so chic and cool - I just wanted something homey! After a comment which was confusingly either a compliment or a statement, she left me to my shaded patio spot and was soon replaced by my server who was an absolute peach! Seriously, she was super great! I ordered a tropical iced tea, which apparently needed a new batch brewing, but she brought me water in the meantime, so I had something to sip on. She quickly took my food order, after giving me a bunch of delicious sounding suggestions - I wasn't super hungry, so I got a single fish taco (one of my favourite things! And always a good test of a place, in my book)   When my food arrived it looked a little fancy, if only because the rice and beans were carefully placed together in a neat circle, not haphazardly smeared everywhere (which, I confess, I kind of love!) but soon proved to be delicious! The fish was super well cooked and tender, and there were two corn tortillas, turning my one taco into two! Hurrah! Needless to say, I ate everything! And the iced tea was yummy too - very refreshing, and I loved the hint of tropical flavour. Hula, I'll be back!",

In addition to the cool, modern ambiance, the menu offers a plethora of Hawaiian-inspired dishes with a focus on fish. A ceviche starter, for instance, delivered fresh-tasting whitefish with a pleasant citrus tang. For the land lubbers among ye, the pork dishes are also well-executed. The jerk pork is a departure from  the classic Caribbean preparation (it's a bit sweeter) but no less tasty, and purists can still rejoice at the presence of plantains.   Pricing here is reasonable (entrees in the teens), the menu is sufficiently varied, service is friendly and prompt, but there is one significant drawback: the music can be ear-splittingly loud.

A small place with only a few tables and booths, Hula's Modern Tiki adds a bit of kitsch and a ton of flavour to a Hawaiian inspired menu.  Their white fish ceviche had a clean, crisp flavour, though the wonton chips served along side made scooping a bit of a challenge.  The entrees packed serious flavour, from the soy-and-pineapple infused shredded Luau pork to the kick of the 'Jawaiian Jerk Pork', served with a sweet johnnycake on the side. The fish, in particular, was super-fresh and bursting with flavour. The ahi, served seared and just rare, provided an excellent base for a macadamia crust and hot mango and papaya salsa.  Anyone looking for something new in Scottsdale should look into Hula's.",

    "text": "Location great.  Prices fantastic.  Service ok.  Food ok.    Love the feel and location.  Perfect weather - the front was open and air was flowing through.  Lots of hard surfaces.  Lots of noise.  Aparently we were 1 of at least 4 groups I noticed celebrating birthdays.  So many hard surfaces though makes the sound VERY loud in the space.  Did I mention the noise?  Ended up only being able to chat with the two people sitting right next to me - the others at the table were on their own to visit.  Kind of made spending time with the birthday boy a miss.  Drink menu large and prices good.  My soda was kept full.  Check.  Service was ok.  Our server was very nice.  Only one complaint.  When you have folks delivering food to a table (especially a group) - figure out a system to know who gets what dish.  I was the closest to where the servers come with food - so I'm being asked to match dishes to guests.  See noise comment above.  I have no clue who ordered what.  You do - you took the order - figure it out!  (I do remember asking if server wanted to take our meal orders when we ordered appetizers.  She said no -I can only remember up to maybe 8 things - I'd have to go get a piece of paper to take more ... so I suppose \"who gets what\" would have overloaded the system.).  I guess what irritated me about it most is that once our end of the table - 5 of us - had our food - and everyone at the other end had none - I'm guessing - using my stellar reasoning powers - that any new dishes coming from the kitchen are more likely to belong at the OTHER end of the table - might make more sense to ask at that end to find the owner If your ordering system has no linkage to guests.  Food.  Don't know how others at our table felt - I do know I didn't hear any complaints (or should I say I COULDN'T HEAR IF THERE WERE ANY) - but I just have to say it was ok - nothing special.   If there were comments - it was too loud for me to hear them (I did mention the noise, right?).   I ordered the pork potstickers.  Deep fried and crispy.  They were good - and the peanut sauce and soy type sauce were ok as well.  Good start.   I ordered the Thai Chicken bowl.  The couple of plantain nuggets I had were seriously the best thing I tasted.  The chicken was tough - a little over cooked.  The sauce on it didn't give me any \"wow\" moments.  The bulk of the dish was cabbage and rice - a LOT of it.  Not a lot of natural flavor there.  Texture yes.  Flavor no.  Don't know if it was missing a sauce or something but a pile of blah.  I did use the left over potsticker sauce to flavor it ... But that was a little overpowering.    Bottom line - I'd go again if the group wants to go, the prices are great and the location is fun.  The food - it's ok.  I wasn't expecting a Michelin star but for Yelp stars gave me an expectation of more.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.  And I'd keep my group small so we can visit better.",

Exactly what I wanted on a Saturday for dinner. Not too loud, good decor.  Drinks: one word: STRONG!! This is definitely a good thing ;)  Food: this is where the loss of one star came into play. Had the won ton ahi thing and that was well reviewed except for the massive amount of ginger, but I picked it off. In regards to the entrees, the people I was with loved theirs! They raved about it. One had the Hula Burger and the other kalbi ribs (I think). The kalbi ribs were apparently better than what they'd eaten in South Korea. Mine, the Spicy chicken bowl, was so subpar. I was extremely disappointed. I wanted to send it back but I didn't want to cause any issues since everything I was with were loving theirs.  I'll definitely return here, there's a lot that looks good on the menu:)",

    "text": "Hesitantly went here on a first drink date, why was I hesitant? Scottsdale is intimidating for small town native Tucson folk. The open patio mixed with a theme is something I previously associated with \"high prices\" and \"attitude.\"    Our bartender, was a friendly gal with some insight to the cocktails, a very classy lip ring and tasteful tattoos (not sure of the relevance here, but it definitely made me consider getting one or two). I work as a mixologist and bartender in the next town down and I have to say, I was very impressed with her knowledge, positive attitude and overall attentiveness.   Coming from a small town, a large city and just wanting some interesting cocktails and friendly vibes? Well I can't vouch for the food, but the drinks and the service will definitely bring us back.",

Was not hospitable in any fashion, barely saw him smile, didn't try to connect the dots with us! Really really disappointed in my visit. Plus my food came out after my friends were done eating! Heard another guest who I assume works here ask him why he was such a dick for throwing silverware and the check at her! I would seriously have a chat with the gentleman working behind the bar 5/18 PM shift, who I know has worked here for quite some time. Would love to tell his name but was never given it! Great specials and food but people come out to eat for the experience and he made me feel like We were an inconvenience  Sorry for the bad review guys!",

That luau pork over the crispy hash browns goes great with the 2 over medium eggs on top... That is my go to breakfast/brunch option...  I have so many other favorites on the menu but I'm making myself hungry as I write this review so this one will be a short one...  The decor here is very cute and goes well in the Old Town area... Service is prompt and some days get busier than others... Great job Hula's #2...",

They served some fusion Thai food, fusion Hawaiian dish, and a lot of other fusion islander dishes you could think of.  When in Scottsdale, fresh food with an ideal islander dish to eat, then this is the place to be.  Their tofu mango taco was delicious. Although I wish the tofu wasn't too bland.  What's islander about this? Well the mango. It's a tropical fruit. My fiance ordered some Thai inspired dish.  It had some kick of spice and added flavor like the avocado and coconut sauce.  What's so islander about this? Well, the avocado and coconut.  I gave this place a 4 star because it's well presented and tasted fresh. I also give them a star for an effort to create a modern islander fusion restaurant. My review should be approved coming from someone who is born and raised on an island called Hawaii!",

We shared a Caesar salad: the $6 side could have fed 4...huge! Hubby had the macadamia hapu and I had the lemongrass hapu...ohmigosh both were delicious! The lemongrass taste was light and not overpowering in any way...I was a bit cautious and really enjoyed it...glad I listened to Ronnie!",

That's not a problem for me, and those waiting must not know what they are missing.  Service was friendly and efficient, with just enough of a personal touch. Service was... well Perfect Thank you's and Good Bye's from others on staff solidified an exceptional team committed to guest satisfaction or better.  My first sip was an amazing Ice Tea, honestly the very best I have ever had. I love Ice tea and lemon and sweetener was offered, not assumed. Refills arrived timely.  Meals arrived quick fresh and hot, mine in particular was very good with the exception of my eggs a tad over cooked but not worth a do over. Hash browns crisp and tasty, amazing bacon proves management is committed to excellent product. Just a slight let down that my English muffin could have been cooked another minute, it was soft and warm, served with butter and jam on the side. I like mine crisp but if this is how they are served here, I can live with that! I really enjoyed my side of Portuguese Sausage. High quality and authentic and just $2.50 for a nice side.  Great service, tasty food, a clean and modern dining room, and excellent value had me saying MAHALO!!!!!",

Their steak sandwich is amazing and you can get 50/50 fries so you get to try their sweet potato and regular and the dipping sauce is SO GOOD. I am not really a \"Hawaiian/Asian\" food fan and i still love this place! You can get poke or a burger or whatever your heart desires! Great happy hour-- lots of fun drinks and cold beers on tap. Prime location in old town right near all the happening spots! There is ample parking nearby which is good too cause sometimes in old town you have to park far or find street parking. I have yet to find a restaurant in old town that hasn't delivered!",

What makes this place great is the various types of food offered all reasonably priced and all tastes great. My family of 3 stopped here after a morning trip to the zoo and we were pleased with the food and service. Drinks were really good and the restaurant was willing to exchange the drinks if we didn't like them. When it came time to ordering Tyler was very patient and explained several things on the menu. Kudos to Tyler for even bringing out a sample of the jerk sauce we inquired about. My girlfriend and I shared the Hilo sliders... OMG get them!! We then shared the Hawaiian jerk pork plate. Tyler even had the kitchen put the entree on two plates for sharing. Bravo. Food was Very very good especially if you like your food a little spicy. Overall we were extremely satisfied to the point that we decided to leave this review as we usually don't leave reviews. Wish we were locals because we would be back. Thanks again Hula!",

I ordered a tropical iced tea and the Spicy Thai Chicken Bowl {not really \"hot\" spicy, just yummy spices!} and it was packed with rice, black beans, avocado, cabbage, and fried sweet plantains. It was so good, I didn't want it to end. Also, the portion was HUGE, I definitely couldn't eat it all! 3 of my family members ordered their black bean burger and said it was so delicious. Their hand-cut fries and macaroni salad were also very yum! We will be back again for sure, i'd love to try dinner! I also hear they have a great happy hour from 3:30p-6 PM on weekdays and all night on Wednesdays. Sign me up!   Thanks for a tasty experience, Hula's!",

This location does the mayo-based slaw with their pork tacos, which I prefer, but you can also request the dry slaw they use at the downtown location if it is your preference.    The first time we went we had Charles (Charlie, I think) as our waiter.  He was absolutely phenomenal.  If he's working, definitely request him.  He's super friendly, very attentive, makes great menu suggestions if requested, and isn't afraid to give you an honest opinion of a dish, which I find to be a sign of a great waiter and restaurant.  The second time we went we also had an excellent waiter, but sadly I cannot remember his name.  The restaurant  is brand new, and has a large open-air layout with both indoor and outdoor seating.   The food is prepared fresh, and the portion sizes are generous.  My fiance is a fan of the shrimp rolls, the fries are hand cut, and the pork tacos are overflowing with juicy goodness.  Just writing the review makes me want to go back for more!  As if that weren't enough, they also have a full bar, and menu specials pretty much every night of the week.  The menu is pretty substantial, so if you haven't been before it may take you some time to decide what you want.  Fairly certain there is no wrong choice, but I think I need to back another time or two, or ten....ya know....just to make sure.",

We settled on a few appetizers - poke (yum) and beef skewers (double yum.) Between the four of us we had the Mongolian Beef, the fresh fish, the luau pork, and the jerk pork. We all felt the meat was cooked very nicely and seasoned well, but none of us were particularly enamored with the macaroni salad. That's a pity because I was really looking forward to Hawaiian Mac Salad. Dessert was a delicious key lime pie - best I've ever had. Kudos!!",

The Mac Salad (what's Hawaiian food without Mac salad??) was pretty good, but the Wasabi Mashed Potatoes were the best!  For entrees we tried he Baja Fish tacos - nicely breaded whitefish, avocado, cabbage, and fresh limes to squeeze. The salsa that came with it was sweet and spicy. Oh, and it also comes with a scoop of white rice and beans.   We also tried the Luau Pork Sandwich - delicious bread that held up to the sandwich, a pile of shredded pork, coleslaw (it tasted sweet, like pineapples) and a side of sweet potato fries.   The service was fantastic and we really enjoyed our dinner.",

My girlfriend and I went to a Mexican place across the street but they didn't open until 11:00 AM.   I asked if they could recommend a place and the young lady said that Hula's was really good.  Once there, I ordered a martini and  my girlfriend had a bloody Mary.  My martini was made from scratch and was very delicious.  I managed to take a sip of the bloody mary only to discover that it was also made from scratch and not from a mix.    After my drink, I ordered French toast.  Very fluffy and delicious.  The portion was generous and I left Hula's full.  A great place if you're in Scottsdale.",

Both were delish however I may be addicted to the fish bites! Mike our waiter was cool and very helpful as far as what to order. Da girls ordered steak tacos and the ahi poke. We all enjoyed every bite of our food. Portions are large!   Vibe was nice and people seemed to be enjoying themselves. We got there around 7 ish and the place was already hopping. We sat at the long table which we shared with a bunch of other people who were in groups. Overall we really enjoyed our experience and definitely will return.",

Boy am I glad I did! It was early (on a Friday night), so it wasn't yet crowded. Service was excellent (cute boys too!), but the food was amazing -for the price, and very very good for ANY price! Place was super clean (even the bathroom) and decorated very cute.  The portions were, for me, PERFECT! I hate to leave feeling hungry; but I hate getting so much I feel stuffed trying not to waste it. The portions and pricing was right on! The sea bass was cooked PERFECTLY (an I'm hard to please on that). 99% of restaurants OVERCOOK the fish. Not here. Tender, succulent, and the Blackened Wasabi that I chose was awesome.  The broccoli rabe was cooked perfectly too, and the wasabi mashed potatoes, well...I almost NEVER eat mashed potatoes. I ate every morsel!  I WILL be back. And I'm gonna tell all my friends to GO!  Gesh, maybe I should get a job here, huh?   (:  You will NOT be sorry...  PS Picture of Blackened wasabi fish is somewhere uploaded  on site...",

Bartender helped me pick the right one for me (\"Not too hoppy, but not too light\"). Wanting to eat light, I ordered the bowl of Lobster Bisque with a side of cibaca bread (worth the dollar), toasted, and a lemon wedge to squirt in the bisque and at my daughter. The bisque was as close as it comes to the best bisque I have ever had (Vegas, 1980s, but maybe after all those years, this was better. Who knows, right?). Casual, cool place with a little Hawaiian thrown in here and there. Nothing cheesey like '60s let's-all-decorate-our-basements-Hawaiian that I recall and dance to \"California Dreamin' \" (I was very, very young, by the way). This place is definitely not geared to old farts on the other hand, but is a cool joint for cool people of all ages, of which to say I am one. My husband took his mid-20s (also-gorgeous) daughter here  on a trip here from her homey state, Boston, and they raved about the food and atmosphere upon returning from a weekday lunch.",

Happy hours and nightly specials, but I had the Mongolian beef bowl instead.  It's beef on a bed of white rice, beans and cabbage.  Not a heck of a lot of beef but the sauce was incredible.  Very filling and I don't imagine lot of calories.  I finished the whole thing - it was that good.  Had two drinks - the painkiller was good (Reminded me of beach vacations years ago) and the blood orange martini was excellent too.  If you get this combo it would be better to drink the martini first (it's not as sweet as the painkiller).  Bill was $29 plus tip - I think reasonable for the area and type of place.  You can definitely save if you go for the specials.  Friendly and professional wait staff.  Five stars, it's my new go-to place in Scottsdsle.",

I went to the bathrooms which are all individual but with a push handle, making them seem like multi-use restrooms resulting in the mid-pee anxiety when someone inevitably pushes on the locked door every minute your in there (signs or a lock with an occupied sign outside would do wonders for confusion). The cute, young waitress took our order, and both appetizers came out before our drinks did. Our drinks that had been sitting on the bar the entire time we were there. We had to ask a different waitress to get them for us.   The appetizers were small, not really meant for sharing with more than one person, max, and definitely wouldn't supplement an entree. The food wasn't bad, but had too many conflicting flavors, and our disappointment at the service made us leave to find a different restaurant to have dinner. The drinks were great, it's in a good location, and I wouldn't actively tell people not to go, we just didn't have a good experience here.  EDIT: the owner of Hula's reached out to apologize for the experience and to see if I could provide more feedback as a teaching moment for their staff. It was such a professional and classy way to address my concerns, despite how great their ratings already are. I added a star because that was really above and beyond what one poor review out of so many great ones deserved. Thanks!!",

My kids and I could just make a fabulous meal just on the starters.  My favorite is the samurai beef sticks with curry sauce.  The Loco Moco is the best I have had on the Mainland.   The coconut cream pie is divine! Thank You again to the owner for being a very gracious and concerned businessman!",

Other members of the staff were also very pleasent and eager to get rid of plates and the like. The vegetarian options didn't feel like an afterthought and were excellent. They were very accommodating in splitting a delicious black bean burger and a tofu bowl between two of us.  I would recommend the special weekend dessert brownie. Great portions for the price. Fun atmosphere. Couldn't have been a better experience.",

The ambiance can be better that's why it's a 4 and not 5, but maybe I'm bias since I've lived in San Francisco and have seen some pretty awesome tiki restaurants.  Anyhow you should check this place out! Also tried my bf pork tacos and they were amazing.",

Since I was there with some friends on a workday for lunch we didn't get any cocktails. We all ended up getting the two taco plate and we were all pretty happy with them. The grilled fish was fantastic! I also got the pork which was good except that it came with a gross coleslaw even though I had specifically asked if the slaw had a dressing and she said no, it was dry cabbage. She didn't come by to ask how everything was so I just let it go. Overall the service was not that great but they are pretty new still so I'll let it slide.  I'd like to give them a try for happy hour but overall it didn't seem to have the same watering hole feel as the one downtown.",

After passing by Hula's for months, I scanned the reviews and the menu and decided to stop in and give it a try.  I sat at the bar, and the bartender immediately came over, provided me with drink and food menus, and asked what he could bring me to drink. I indicated that I hadn't been in before, needed a few minutes, and wasn't in a hurry. He said just to let him know when I was ready.  A few minutes later I made my decision, and put the menu down. He immediately returned. I asked if they had decaf coffee, and he said he would be glad to brew a fresh pot for me. I asked for half caffeinated half decaf, and ordered the Portuguese Sausage Island Benedict, and explained that I needed my eggs to have completely firm whites. He said that would be no problem at all. He was attentive, friendly, smiled and made good eye contact at all times - hallmarks of great service.  A short while later he brought my coffee. It was WONDERFUL. He explained that it was Kona coffee, and that he would refill it whenever I was ready. I relaxed and opened my book (I always carry one) and settled in to enjoyed reading and sipping my coffee.  My food did take a fair amount of time to be prepared, but I arrived right when they opened and allowed that they were probably just getting going. I also knew that my egg preparation would take extra time and attention. I had a refill on my coffee as I continued to wait. I wasn't in a hurry, and was enjoying the setting.  When my plate arrived, it looked perfect, and when I cut into my eggs they were done exactly the way I had asked for them - a big deal for me since I'm finicky about eggs. The English muffins were still soft enough to absorb the delicious hollandaise sauce, which was generously applied to the dish. The Portuguese Sausage was perfectly cooked and still juicy but not fatty. My hashbrowns were crisp, the way I had ordered them. My plate was perfect, and I took my time enjoying it. The bartender checked back with me soon after I tried my dish to make sure it was to my liking, and to refill my coffee again. The portion was too generous for me to finish, but the dish was so good, I didn't want to stop eating it.  The restaurant wasn't busy yet, so I felt free relaxing, reading, and sipping coffee. When I realized that the morning happy hour had started, I decided to try a cranberry mimosa for the bargain price of $2. Who could pass that up! It was a great way to finish off my meal. Full, refreshed, and ready to go, I couldn't believe that my entire bill was only about $15.   Overall, a great experience. Great service, great food, and a relaxing environment. I will be returning. I want to try the Spam Island Benedict next.",

We asked to see a menu before they sat us, just to see what type of food they served, and they were happy to oblige. Everything sounded so good, and would be fun to try. Also, being that it happened to be Happy Hour, it didn't make for a hard decision to stay and eat. Everything was so amazing, and the waiter was extremely helpful and explained everything we wanted to know on the dishes. Aside from running out of Key lime pie, there was no let down what so ever. Can't be mad about the pie anyway, I'm sure if it was as good as the rest of the food and drinks it goes quick until its gone. Definitely will be back on our next trip out.",

Although there were quite a few places to sit and a near empty bar, it took several minutes to be greeted by a hostess, two of them were too busy talking to each other to acknowledge us. We were eventually seated and the service was lackluster. We ordered our food and when it came one of the dishes was incorrect. OK, stuff happens, but when my friend told the waiter her order was wrong, he argued with her, saying he remembered distinctly what she ordered. But he was wrong. He hadn't written the order down and was simply wrong. He huffed and took the plate back, remarking once again that she had ordered it. The rest of us were served, and eventually she was brought her food by a different server. He said, \"Lucky for you we weren't too busy or you would have had to wait a lot longer.\" That did it. We won't be back, and it's too bad. The food and the drinks are good. I tipped 18% on the $84.00 bill, but I shouldn't have. There are too many fine choices in Old Town.

Since the tiki theme seemed to lend itself more to the bar side, I expected good drinks and was not disappointed (plus happy hour prices all night on Wed!).  I love a good Mai Tai and Hula's made one that could stand proud even in Honolulu.  Not the best I ever had, but by far the best I ever had on the mainland.  They had several of the Kona brewing beers and my wife had the Fire Rock Pale Ale, which is always good.  So drinks taken care of, we began to peruse the food listings.  My wife had Duke's Roast Pork entree and I had an entree of Seared Ahi with Jerk sauce.  Both were large servings and quite tasty.  The roast pork was pulled in a mound on the center of the plate with rice on one side and slaw on the other.  The ahi was cooked medium, the jerk sauce was darker than a traditional Jamaican jerk but made a nice accompaniment.  The dish also included a couple of cooked plantains (yummy) and a couple of squares of a nut bread of some sort (tasty), plus a mound of rice.  Very satisfying.  We love key lime pie, so we decided to try it even though we were pretty full.  The pie was 4 inches high and a nice sized wedge, with probably an inch of the key lime filling and the rest whipped cream with graham cracker crust.  We managed to finish the key lime part but left a bit of whipped cream and crust.  The restaurant has a bright airy feel to it and the tiki themed decorations were fun.  It was a very pleasant reminder of trips to the islands and I recommend you try it for drinks and food.",

I just expected a lot more and was told by the bartender that the other central location is better themed so I hope that they're going to make some additions as far as the decor goes . Now we had just eaten at Malee's Thai Room so we didn't sample any of the food items. What we did have was this giant scorpion bowl drink that was strong as heck and tasted awesome - flaming nectar of the gods it was. Bravo! Mr. Bartender. We would have stayed just a little bit longer but there was an extremely intoxicated noisy loud platinum blonde Snottsdale bimbo screeching stupidity right next to my wife's ear so we decided to pack it up after one. I'll make my way down here again and check it out again and maybe downtown too.",

    "text": "Our favorite restaurant in Scottsdale! Cool Hawaiian vibe, delicious fish, excellent drinks! Our waiter forgot a kids meal, probably because she didn't write anything down when taking 5 peoples orders, but instead made up for it by rushing it out for us. It arrived a few minutes later and all was well! Wasabi mash had some good kick to it and the ceviche was a perfect appetizer on a warm Scottsdale evening! I look forward to returning to Scottsdale and will definitely be back here if we can get in!",

Great drinks, happy hour, and the food my wife and I had were awesome! The staff from the hostess to the Management is as friendly and welcoming as you will ever find in a restaurant. We will most certainly recommend to our friends and be back!",

    "text": "As a huge fan of the Phoenix location and now a resident of Old Town Scottsdale, I was beyond stoked to know that I live less than 2 miles away from the new location. Dana is a great owner and the staff at both locations are amazing. Location in Old Town is perfect and the decor is always on point, I would totally live on the patio! As a vegetarian, their menu stands out for me compared to other restaurants. I can't get enough of their Big Sur Black Bean Burger. You may be thinking, \"Grrrrreat. ANOTHER veggie burger for the non meat people\".. No way, this burger is perfect, not bland and is AWESOME with added avocado. The tofu tacos and bowls are fantastic too. To the reviewer who said that everything was a little spicy.. Well, I'm sorry to burst your bubble but it is pacific islander style food. It's meant to have a kick and boy does it rule. The drink list is a lot of fun as well, I always look forward to a Tiki Bastard or good old fashion Zombie! Thanks Hula's, you have a regular for as long as I'm in Arizona :)",

It was really big and the flavors were spicy and chic was super tender. The meal was all that more enjoyable by our awesome and super nice server Skyler.  Thanks for the great service.",

Our tropical drinks were really delicious, and the service was excellent. This place wins for uniqueness. And the Old Town location is convenient to all the fun shopping. We ordered all appetizers, and they were excellent. We highly recommend the crispy coconut shrimp rolls. They are outstanding!",

    "text": "I use to live in Central Phoenix and regularly made trips to the Hula's on Central Ave. When the Scottsdale Hula's opened I was ecstatic! The staff is all really friendly and every time my husband and I visit the waiters remember us and chat us up.  The food is so good... All of the tacos are great and if you are just going to have snack the appetizer menu is quite impressive.  I think the only thing I have had that I was on the fence about was the calamari strips.  I'm a huge fan of the ceviche and ahi! The Dr. Funk and Painkiller are great drinks for anyone looking to enjoy their all Wednesday happy hour and the seasonal Longboard beers are great too! I would strongly suggest this place! I am giving this four stars only because the patio seating is so small and I feel like I can never get a table outside.  Living in Scottsdale, I personally love to take advantage of the outdoors. However, if you don't mind being inside they have a great and spacious seating arrangement with a retracting wall to bring in the fresh air.",

    "text": "We went on a Tuesday with a group of 8. Everyone sort of showed up at their own pace, so we had friends that had already ordered food when we showed up. However our server gave us menus and got our drinks and everything started out fine. My boyfriend and I wanted to get a couple of appetizers, but our server dropped off beers at the other end of the table and never came back. We waited and all had our drinks and he never came back to get our orders. By the time he came back we decided it wasn't worth it to us to wait even longer for refills or food and asked for our bill. He then proceeded to wander around and not get us our bill for another 20 minutes. There were probably less than 5 other groups in the restaurant at the time. We didn't get to try anything. I have nothing about it that would make me want to come back.",
