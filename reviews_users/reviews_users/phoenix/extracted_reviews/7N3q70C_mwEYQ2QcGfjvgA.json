The restaurant is pretty small but right on the corner so it's easy to find. Really nice decor and pretty chill. I ordered the Pineapple Fried Rice and spring rolls. I've never seen pineapple put in fried rice and was concerned, but I tried it and it was awesome; full of flavor and delicious. Same goes with the spring rolls. Great little place to grab some lunch.",

We ordered fried clamari and fried tofi for starters, both starters were bland and lacked any kind of seasoning. Chicken satay was good. Bunch of us ordered fried rice and who the heck puts lettuce in fried rice. Both fried rice and green curry had loads of frozen vegetables not cooked properly. I could taste the ice in the veggies.  They just focus on food quantity and absolutely lacked quality.  I dont even want to comment about the service; the servers were rude and didnt care for us.",

I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes after ordering. The lunch special is reasonably priced and includes an entree, egg roll and soup.   They offer a range of ''spiciness'' from 1-5. I usually go for 3 or 4 depending on how I'm feeling. 5 is Thai Hot and it's too hot for me. I love the Thai ice tea and wish they were refillable.   There is a bar here but never ordered a drink.",

I did not taste the curry so I am giving it 4 stars because I think they forgot to add it into my rice.  I did order food to go. I order the yellow curry with rice to go. I could taste the coconut milk with the curry and was not a big fan of the milky taste. I would go again because of the service and prices and happy hour is a plus!",

My favorite thai restaurant at home had a head chef who was the owner's Thai mother (he literally brought her from Thailand to cook authentic Thai)... so, yeah. I know my thai food.   This place is AWESOME. I have no idea what the bad reviews are referring to- because this food is delicious. Appetizers are incredibly affordable (especially during happy hour)- let me recommend the chicken satay and spring rolls to start.   I have wanted here many times and have enjoyed several of their curries, fried rices, and pad thai- NEVER disappointed. Try the sweet peanut curry- it will rock your world. Their peanut sauce is also amazing, and as a side with their pad thai... oh yes.  I am also a sometimes-vegetarian, and their dishes all give you the option of what kind of protein, which I think is awesome. Their tofu is flash fried and then added, which helps it maintain shape and texture. Did I mention it was delicious?  Survey says: go here. Eat their delicious food. Thank me later!",

Generous for the price, yes, but very bland. (I ordered it mild, not dead.) Please note that the chai tea is not the American-style blended, froathy tea but just tea with a lot of ginger in it. That was good. Maybe one should just stick to appetizers and dessert??  As far as the atmosphere goes, it was memorable. Even on a Saturday, the place is quiet.",

Not only, as stated above, is this lunch time friendly, their curry is super yummy. Their lunch portion is smaller than dinners but it is just right. Steamed rice with your choices of curries and meats. They have shrimp, tofu, vegetables, beef, chicken, pork and seafood. So many options, right? I simply can't choose so I always get seafood and steal some chicken or veggies off my sisters' plates. Of course, this meal is not complete if you simply order water. You have got to try their Thai Iced Tea; you can share this because it does get overwhelming after awhile with the curries. The other nice option is to have hot tea which warms you up and cleanses your palate after a bite of curry.",

It comes out in 10 minutes. It tastes pretty good.... and did I mention, it's $7.95. Granted this is for the chicken pork or beef. Shrimp is $2 more and seafood special is $3 more.   I usually get the special with chicken or the chow mein with chicken or pork. Spice levels are low meaning Medium for me is not problem. Friends have had hot and Thai hot and they said the same, could kick it up a notch.   Service is alway slightly above par. Meaning it's not fantastic but it's good enough to never have to complain. And they routinely fill the water glass.   All in all, this is a no frills Thai restaurant that doesn't pretend to be anything else. Food is above average considering price point.  Great value!",

    "text": "3/14/2017 Thai Basil Tempe, AZ 1111 S Rural Rd, Tempe, AZ 85281 ~ 1.4 Miles (480) 557-0101  I genuinely love Thai Basil, back in 2013 I started my freshman year at Arizona State University. Back in those days, I didn't have my own car so it left my food options very limited. My residence hall at that time was located right next door to Thai Basil. I remember thinking at first that the outside of the building looked old, sketchy, and somewhat rundown. I admit, I was being a snob and flat out refused to try it just based on its outer appearance. However, one day I got the BIGGEST hankering for Asian food and Thai Basil was the only thing within walking distance. I was so sick of eating mess hall food and frozen dinners, so I caved and walked in one day.  I could not have been more wrong about my previous misconceptions of the place. Upon walking in you are immediately greeted by their extremely professional and friendly staff. The restaurant is extremely clean, the food smells amazing, and the ambience they have created on the inside with their decorations makes you feel like you are actually in Thailand dining in a fancy restaurant. I remember being completely blown away by this, the exterior of the building looks old but the interior is amazing and cozy. The food itself is by far some of the best food I have ever consumed, I have tried multiple dishes there and I have always really enjoyed what I've ordered. I have never ever had a bad meal there; their yellow Thai curry is to die for! I have been to multiple other Thai Basil locations over the years and this one remains my favorite.  This location has the freshest food, the nicest atmosphere, and by far the friendliest and most helpful staff. The owners in particular really make you feel at home here and they are by far the nicest people I have ever met. Their store is well run, efficient, and they make sure that their staff also treats the customers as family while in the store. This attitude is something specific to this store because the other stores I've been to don't have staff that is as friendly or efficient as the team here. Another thing I really enjoy about this business is how affordable it is, being a poor college student at the time I loved eating here on the regular because of how affordable it is. They also give you extremely large portions of food so you get your money's worth.  Depending on what you order, you can expect a nice hearty entree, mixed vegetables, and a bowl of rice. All of this costs around $10.00 and given how big the portions are here you can usually take home leftovers and get another meal out of it. I cannot stress enough how amazing this place is, if you haven't tried it or are afraid to give it a shot don't be. Thai Basil is by far one of my favorite places to dine at to this day.",

The selection is good and the food comes out fast. You can specify how spicy you want most of the dishes and they are good about getting it just right. I vary the amount of spiciness depending on my mood and they're always spot on.  The other nice thing about this place is that I have never had to wait for a table.

It is quite a bit bigger than the University location (that is the only other location I have been to, and partly why this one is getting five stars). We took a few minutes to figure out what we were getting (well not me, I order the same thing every time, I need to venture out a little more, but I just love love love the masaman and Thai fried rice so much). My Sis got the masaman also, she is stuck on it like I am, and our friend got the sweet and sour. The food came out so fast, like five minutes! Of course my Sis and I loved it, we are Thai Basil fanatics. Our friend had never had Thai, but she said she really liked what she ordered. We indulged and got the sticky rice dessert, and I loved it.   I am going with a five for a few reasons. First, this place impressed me more than the University location, which says a lot in my eyes because I love the University location a lot. The service there has always been amazing. The food was good 'ol Thai Basil, but something about it was just better. The cook must have just been better or something, cause it was just better for some reason. So as far as comparison, this location is great and gets a five! Also, this is coming from my narrow Thai food scope, but it is the best I have had. The only other Thai places I have eatin at are Line Thai and Siam Thai, both are great, but this Thai basil location is awesome!",

Thai Basil is the 5th restaurant in the continuation of the empire of Thai Basil which is ravaging the valley.  Same great quality here.  Same freshness and variety of flavor that is known across campus.  What's an improvement to this one is this has bar and grill.  They have a nice small selection of beers and wines, including thai beer.  A few dishes differ from the other Thai Basils, including what I had, the Crying Tiger.  I had never heard of this.  What it was, was a grilled steak with a fresh green chili sauce.  Really tasty and fresh, the chilis being fresh brought a different spiciness, which can come back to haunt...   Went back for Happy Hour, which is from 4-6 every day but Sunday.  They have a nice selection of 1/2 off apps and also some salads (including the aforementioned Tiger).  Fresh salads for happy hour is a great addition to my after work snack repertoire.  $2 domestics and $3 imports (including Kirin)  Thai Basil has notoriously good veggies in their dishes, excellent curries and noodle dishes.  A good place to introduce newbies to Thai food and a place that will continually draw you back on weekday nights for hearty, healthy, tasty thai foods.",

    "text": "Since my first ride on Tempe's Orbit transportation system I saw it. That SIGN that teasing sign... Thai Basil! For months I saw it as I rode by on my way to and from class. For months I wondered what was really going on behind the tinted windows. Was it open? Was it closed? There's no reviews for it on yelp! Could it be... an undiscovered place in the middle of the ASU area?! Can't be!! It must be an fluke! For months I saw the occasional car in the parking lot, but the sign was never lit, never any signs of life... until tonight!!  As I came home from class I saw balloons adrift from Thai Basil's once lifeless rooftop! It's open! It's open! My stars! It's open! I could smell the Lar Nar! SHWEET!!  I considered going there after class to see if it lived up to the hype in my mind but a pesky homework assignment called me home and so I broke out the sweats and fired up the lappie thinking it was going to be loong night when my friend Becca came to my rescue!  We entered the brand spakin' new Thai Basil on the night of their grand opening when I realized that maybe it wasn't going to live up to the hype in my head. We entered and saw a cool looking dining room to the left with coffee tables and pillows for dining on (yay!) and some pretty cool looking booths (yay!), a bar with wine proudly displayed (double yay!) and huge dishes of after dinner mints (triple yay!)  and then we were seated in the corner away from all the fun (boo). They didn't have a wine or drink list eaither. (double boo) Yeah it kind of sucked because I think we were seated by the bathroom but oh well.   I had their White Zin, sweet but nothing great - it's barefoot. I like barefoot, but still I know there's some wine conossiours out there who'd rather put their foot in their mouth than drink a glass of barefoot. Unfortunatly, my very thirsty friend realized that there weren't ANY mixed drinks there! but there's a bar RIGHT over there!! Hopefully they'll get this straightened out soon otherwise that nice spiffy bar is just a very fancy bottle tray!  On to the food...  Beckita shall be mentioned first as her meal hit the table about a good 8 minutes before mine did! She had the Veggie Delight with Chicken... question: wouldn't that render this dish a Chicken Delight? I'm just saying. It had various veggies, the usual suspects: Carrots, zucchini, green onions, sprouts etc.. I had a bite and it was way too garlickly for my taste. She liked it just fine. I don't think I'd order it but I could see a lot of people enjoying it.   I had the Rad Nar, which is their version of Lar Nar... wide rice noodles with stir fried carrots, broccoli and beef all swimming in a savory gravy. I ordered mine with extra carrots and hot. I got the carrots but was missing the heat. The beef was a little too tough for my liking. Also, The waitress gave me a dish of red chili flakes and told me to add my own spice. If that was the plan all along then why ask me how hot do I want it? Is this to proportion the chili flakes?   We skipped dessert, split the check and called it a night. Tableside, we decided that this was a solid 3 stars. The service was decent but not great, the place was clean but wasn't very modern or comfy (well atleast the section we were in) and it just felt like a solid 3 star place. To my yelpers I say: If you're very close by (saaaaay the ASU dorms?) and don't have transportation and MUST have thai food or you'll burst then give Thai Basil a try. Hopefully, they'll work out some of the smaller kinks for you by then!",

First of all, the decor is lovely - it's modern Asian flair that isn't stuffy or over the top. I loved the bench seating style with the cushions - very comfy.  The food was tasty - I was actually worried it'd be a bit watered down (this is my first Thai Basil visit EVER)  but it was actually good. It could have been a tad spicier (I tried to play it safe with the medium but ended up dousing my food in peppers anyway) but it was still enjoyable. I had lunch with 3 of my friends, and I shared pad thai with one (my favorite Thai dish - it wasn't the best pad thai I'd ever had, but I will go back for more) and I had the chicken panang. I like the panang to be a bit sweeter, but it was still delicious.   As far as the service, I hate to say that it's your average small-time Asian restaurant service. Everyone basically seems rushed all the time, no one was personable, and they just did the bare minimum - take orders, drop off food, and I honestly can't remember anyone smiling. We sat without our waters refilled for quite some time and only had it refilled when our food arrived. There really wasn't much else to it.  If the service improves, I'm sure the tips will too. But I'll definitely come back for the great food.",

There are great lunch deals there, plus air conditioning to get out of the Tempe heat.   $7 for soup, pad thai, salad and thai iced tea. It's less than $10 for tax plus tip. Not bad. I have to agree with the other Yelpers about the crappy service. It has such yummy food that I want to rate higher, but I can't do it.",

    "text": "After my visit to Thai Basil yesterday, I realized that Thai Basil means great food and lousy service.   I really enjoyed my plate. I decided to try something I've never had and went with the Pineapple fried rice with chicken. There is also some curry mixed in. The dish was great. I do wish there was more chicken. There wasn't much chicken overall.  I also sampled my wife's pad thai and was also really good. She was jealous of my selection though.  Where do I begin about the service? We were sat down promptly and then proceeded to wait quite awhile before the sever came back to take our drink/food order. Since this was a long delay we ordered our drinks and food at the same time. We waited for the food for about 10-15 minutes (which was fine), but guess what, no drinks still! Slowly, two plates come out, no drinks. A few minutes pass and my plate arrives. We ask again and finally our drinks arrive. WTF?   The server must have been new, inexperienced at handling a couple of tables, just bad or a combo of all of them. As I ate, the two tables next to us had to deal with similar experiences. The folks next to us had to wait about the entire time we ate to get their check. At least our payment only took about 5 minutes.   I found the service provided unacceptable! One of the worst experiences I've had. I'm just happy the food helped ease the blow of the ineptitude.    With better service this place can easily be a 4.  I hope next time the service is better at Thai Basil, because the food is very good. Maybe I'll save myself the trouble and get take out.",

We were told that they had to make sure there was enough because it's so hard to make the tea, that it takes them a whole day to make it. That is no excuse, you should definitely NOT portion it out to your customers (especially that early in the day). If it's that hard to make, either don't offer it or make enough.

Ironically I had read a previous reviewer who mentioned that this place had excellent pad thai because it wasn't drowned in sauce... I thought that was peculiar because I had never really had Pad Thai that I would describe as being too saucy... Well it must be an Arizona thing.. and if this place was NOT soupy, I would hate to visit the more saucy pad thai joints. Maybe they just serve it in a bowl with a spoon? :) My Pad thai was drenched in a syrupy sauce that really took away from the taste and texture of the rest of the ingredients. On the plus side, the seafood was cooked well. The prices weren't horrible either. But I wouldn't go back. Obviously the tastes of the students near by has something to do with this places 4 star rating :)",

    "text": "I worked at a Thai restaurant for four months before moving down to Phoenix and was really craving some yummy Thai food. We were seated, waited a while for the drinks (no biggie), kind of an awkward exchange before ordering food (no biggie.) The fresh rolls were delicious, fresh, the sauces were really yummy. I ordered the Yum Woon Sen, which I had before at the restaurant I'd worked at (not a Thai Basil restaurant) but I knew that every place was going to be different, so I was curious to see how it tasted there. My husband orders the orange chicken.  The Yum Woon Sen (it's a salad) comes out. I'd ordered it without chicken but it came out with chicken (still, no biggie. It's not like I hate chicken.) I put some on my plate, and I smell this weird smell, but I'm like, whatever, Yum Woon Sen has always been delicious before. I take a bite and there is this OVERWHELMING fish flavor, like half a bottle of fish sauce had been dumped in there. My husband tastes it and agrees it's rank so we put it to the side.   The orange chicken is okay. It essentially tastes like Panda Express, chewy, small pieces of chicken with tough breading - not what we were looking for. The chicken tasted like it had been breaded and frozen, not fresh, and the vegetables sat on the side looking sad and uninspired. But it was edible, so we ate it.   The waitress comes by and asks us how it is and I tell her about the Yum Woon Sen. \"It's just got this overwhelming fish flavor, which I didn't expect since it's a chicken dish, and I really don't like it and don't want it.\" She asks if I want something else. I say no. She says, are you sure? You don't want a chicken salad? No. She takes the plate. I figure I'm kind of done experimenting since that one turned out so badly. My husband and I eat the orange chicken and at the end she the check.  \"The manager took 15% off,\" she says. I think, oh, wow, on top of taking off the dish? That's so nice.   No. The guy took of 15% of the total check.   When she comes back I say, \"I know this isn't your fault, but he only took off 15%? He didn't take off the dish?\"   \"No.\"  \"Can I talk to your manager then?\" She tells me he's up at the cash register.  I explain the situation to him and ask why he only took 15% off. \"We can't just give out free food here. You can't just try this, I don't like it, try that, I don't like it.\"  WHAT?!  I argue, tell him it tasted like fish - \"but there's no fish in it (not entirely accurate since there was shrimp in it)\" YEAH. I know. Which is why it shouldn't have tasted like fish.  Eventually he very grumpily takes the meal off, still complaining that he can't just give away free food, we pay and leave.   We won't be going back. The food was mediocre and that Yum Woon Sen was really gross. We would have considered going back just for the fresh rolls if he hadn't been so rude and stingy. Whether you're Burger King or a five star restaurant, if a patron tastes the food, thinks it's gross, and gives it back, YOU DO NOT CHARGE THEM FOR IT. If you can't afford to lose $8 worth of food (really, less than that since you're only losing the cost) to keep a customer, then you shouldn't be in business.",

(If you don't like your Thai that hot, go to the one of University.) They have the best lettuce wraps in town (forget P.F. Chang's), and they also are willing to grab your extra lettuce as they are more than generous with the chicken. Their Tom Ka Ga is amazing and light, with the most incredible little porcini mushrooms floating about. My favorite is the eggplant dish, medium, with tofu. (I'm not vegetarian; I just really love the way they fry their tofu.) Everything I have had, though, is incredible, and you cannot go wrong.  This is also a great place for large parties. We've shown up last minute with 12-15 people, and they accommodated us without hesitation. They also have great memories, and if you, like me, have a favorite, they will remember it :)   PS Get the Thai iced tea to heal the burn.",

My friend ordered curry, I ordered the Pad Pak, and my fiance ordered the Drunken Noodle. Curry was served long before my fiance and I recieved our dishes. They knew they messed up by bringing out the curry so early and tried to cover by asking if my friend wanted to share her curry with us.

The Thai Basil, their signature dish, is also delicious and has lots of fresh veggies. My only complaint is they do not use cilantro or lime in their pad thai, which I think is pretty standard for pad thai, and which I do miss (I asked for a lime once, and they said they don't have any! strange for a thai place, no?). However, when I order takeout that isn't an issue for me, since I usually have those things at home and I can add them myself :)   If you're looking for a scrummy treat, try the Thai Iced coffee.

My gourmand of a self thinks that on many levels, it's the penultimate example of the gentrification of world cuisine - as if Arizonans couldn't handle the dishes as they'd been prepared in Thailand, every dish was constructed with a pre-picked starch, meat and sauce, same vegetables in every single friggin' dish.  Thai Basil Beef? Cabbage, broccoli, carrots, zuchini, red peppers and bamboo shoots.  Fried Rice? Rice, cabbage, broccoli, carrots, zuchini, red peppers and bamboo shoots.  Spicy Noodles with Shrimp? Rice noodles, shrimp, cabbage, broccoli, carrots, zuchini, red peppers and bamboo shoots.  It's kind of insulting in a way - it's like \"Give us some credit and make the food the way you'd make it for yourself! Not the Thai version of Panda Express\"  And yet, I go to Thai Basil.  All the time.  When I'm jonesing for stir fry or a mess of rice, it's cheap and plentiful.  And it tastes really good.  Aside from the curries, which are shockingly bland, the rice and noodle dishes are all insanely edible.  It makes me feel guilty for being a hater and demanding that my Thai food taste like Thai food.  In the words of Jamiroquai, \"if I like it, I do it...\"  I guess this will continue to be my drunken hookup of a restaurant.  I don't want to make my love public, but I'm all up in it like the rest of the crowd.  Ok, I'll put my haterade down now ;)",

    "text": "I like Thai Basil and come here pretty often as it is easy for me to walk here on my lunch break between classes or call for take out on my way home or for a quick dinner. I generally stick to a few basic things with the curry dishes (panang curry being a favorite of mine) and tom-kah soup. I mix it up with what meat i get in things but usually chicken in my curries and beef in soup.  I tend to order my foods hot which is very spicy in the soup but not so bad in the curries. They pack good flavor especially the soup but the meats just seem off in the curries, they don't seem to have the right flavor or texture.  The beef in the soup is perfect however and melts in the mouth. The other thing i have noticed is when i have ordered other curry dishes that have potatoes they seem to lack flavor and don't absorb the curry like i am used to. The one time I ordered a non-curry dish i got the eggplant garlic which had great flavor but sadly lacked on the eggplant.  I do love the lunch specials here at $7 for a meal that is an entree with rice and a little spring roll it sure beats an over priced meal at the MU or McDonalds next door for the same price. I keep coming back because it's convenient and fills a craving for thai food and my spicy side. Honestly i could have the tom-kah soup with beef all the time as that spicy coconut soup is just perfect. Yet for a complet Thai meal with a curry dish and soup Thai Elephant is my go too.",

Service was excellent and the staff was friendly and responsive.  Dinner #1 was chicken satay skewers as an appetizer and chicken pad thai as the entree. The appetizer was very good, especially wiath a Sapporo beer (hard to find, in my experience.) I ordered the pad thai with medium spice and it was just right---my lips were burning a bit but the heat didn't overwhelm the flavors. The entree was huge---I got though only 2/3 of it and I was hungry.  Dinner #2 was lemon grass soup with chicken. Again, I ordered medium spice and it was just right for me. The soup was excellent, although I had to pick out pieces of lemon grass.  Overall, a good value and very good food. If I'm in the area I'll make a point of visiting.",

    "text": "This place leaves a lot to be desired for me.There is a lot of Thai places to choose from in the Valley. They certainly do not need my business. But, I feel I have no reason to ever come back here. I really wanted to try the one on University. But, since I was driving down Rural, I thought I would give it a try. It was about 1:30 so the lunch rush was over.  The lot has lots of parking, and the place is clean and well decorated inside. The ladies room is clean also. The thing is ,when I came in there was only two other tables other than me. The first table was just getting up to leave. So then there was just 2 of us. My server cleaned every dirty table in the place until she came to take my order. I ordered the Yellow Curry with shrimp.  While it was good , I feel that it was the Sweet Yellow Curry. Which is good , but I wanted the Spicy Yellow Curry. I happened to hear the man at the other table tell them they gave him the wrong tea. He wanted Green tea and was given something else. I wanted Jasmine Tea and was given the correct Tea.  No one ever came back to my table the entire time I was there to see if I needed a refill, to check on my food, or bring me the check. I finally had to as a male server for my check. The food was good , but customer service is not.  They are located in the middle of ASU so they have plenty of Business. So I know that is why they probably really don't care about one person stopping in for lunch. But, I know I won't return.",

Haven't seen Tom in a few months, so it was nice catching up.  The text conversation continues....  They picked \"Thai Basil\" and dinner is at 6:00 - we will never make it in time!  Whatever, I said.  I've become familiar with the peculiarities of my in-laws and found the best approach is to just go along for the ride, no matter how bumpy.  We hit the 202 around five-thirty, expecting to get jammed up as we headed east.  Arriving at Rural road, it occurs to us that it's also another Grad night at ASU, and the right lane is backed up over the river.  Whatever, I spun past in the left lane.  Arriving at Thai Basil, I have to admit, my expectations were set on low.  My only previous experience with Thai Basil was take-away that was dry and oily and just weird stuff.  We were quickly escorted to a back, partitioned-off area and met the rest of the family.  The dining room is clean and modern, mostly tables and chairs with a tiny bar.  The area we were seated had more of an Asian feel, large, boxy booths with no backs and a thin cushion to sit on.  Iced tea for me and alcohol for the others was quickly brought out and everybody settled in.  For an appetizer, we had the crunchy vegetarian egg-roll.  Nicely sized, a bit larger than a fat, short cigar and tasty with a slightly pungent/sweet dipping sauce.  My daughter explained that you can order your food with a varying spice level 1-5, with 5 being hottest.  She also said that that heat level varied depending on where you were eating.  I played it safe and went with Spicy Noodles with Chicken at a level 3.  The wife had some sort of dish with giant scallops in it.  BIL had a seafood curry and I cannot remember the rest.  The meals arrived quickly, although not all at the same time, we had to wait a bit for the wife's dinner.  Spicy noodles was delicious.  Bite-sized chunks of chicken, mixed with a variety of crispy veggies - nicely done broccoli and other stuff.  Very tasty, I scarfed the plate.  Iced tea was fresh.  Wife loved her dish and boxed up about half of it to take home for a couple more meals.    No complaints on the meals, portions were large and service was attentive without hovering.  Ambiance was really nice - quiet enough that we could actually have a conversation with each other.  Most importantly, Nonnie was happy, she got her family dinner with family togetherness.",

This is a  family owned and operated location where all work together very well, bringing you a lovely experience while dining.   Our server let us know they will adjust the heat level on any dish and gave some help with what to order.   The food was delicious!  We each ordered from different parts of the menu and shared all the food. The challenge was finding what was the favorite of the evening.    Impossible.  Each dish was unbelievably well done, delivered hot and seasoned obviously, by the hand of a pro!  It was wonderful to see how well the entire staff worked together to make us feel welcomed and treated like family.  They didn't skip a beat, once the food was done it was brought to the table by all available staff.  Our server stopped by to see that we each received exactly what was ordered and if it was the correct heat level for our liking.  Drink refills were constant.  This restaurant does exactly the right thing.  Great food, fresh and hot from the kitchen very large portions and follow up to see if you need anything more. Thai Basil is very clean and nicely decorated.  As for earlier reviews, they do have a note on the menu that says groups of 5 or more will have a 15% additional charge.  We were so happy, we left more.",

Luckily, at Thai basil, the lights are dimmed and jazzy music played in the background- finally a dinner place that's relaxing and easy on the wallet!  My boyfriend got the Pad Thai (we like to try this at every Thai place we eat) and it did not disappoint! As another reviewer mentioned, veggies were fresh and cooked just right! Great flavor and portion. I ordered red curry for the first time (I usually like green) and it was a hit for me too. Opted for medium spice and it was the perfect blend of flavorful and spicy but not to the point where your nose runs faster than you can catch.   Overall a great date night and attentive, friendly staff. Love supporting local businesses that deserve it!",

    "text": "Thai food and restaurant service in general does not get better anywhere in Tempe than here. I've been patronizing them since they opened, as I also did the Japanese restaurant that preceded them here. They've always been very good, but in the past year they have seriously improved to possibly my favorite place to eat in all of Tempe. I somewhat suspect that some of the 1-2 star reviews for this location are by competitors.  A hallmark of food such as this is the freshness and quality of the veggies and meats that they use in their dishes and theirs is always very clean and fresh tasting. Everything from the soup they give you prior to your main meal, to the jasmine iced tea to the heavier foods with sauces such as the curries and pad thai. They are very good about asking what spice level you would like and delivering on that choice. The value is quite excellent also; the amount of food you receive for the price is absolutely spot on.  As for service - they are kind, friendly and very attentive. Even during crazy lunch rushes, they seem to try and have a full staff with everyone dutifully attending their roles and tending to their customers. As a stated previously by at least one reviewer, their parking lot is very small. However, I've been there before during one of the lunch rushes and one of them actually came out of the establishment the moment I pulled in and helped direct me around their building to a good place to park. Just absolutely outstanding service.  No question I'm a fan. I stress to anyone who feels that they've had a bad experience here, give them another try. It will absolutely be worth it. It's a small, family run establishment that puts a lot of heart into their food and I appreciate that greatly.",

During both visits we had the Spicy Honey Pork and the Thai Basil w/Shrimp.  Incredible dishes but our favorite was the Spicy Honey Pork.

Their servers are great and always recognize us and our order and we always get out of there for under $20. Their door has a great flavor and the location is small but really cute. My only complaint is that their hours are a little funky so sometimes we for get they close for a bit during the day. Highly recommend.",

I guess to a college student it probably tastes great, however, family of foodies will never eat here again.  Honestly, I think we're gonna just avoid the ASU area all together.",

Sadly this time while I was waiting for my food I looked up and the older man, who I think is the owner as he mainly handles the cash register,  was wiping his nose on a handkerchief from his shirt pocket- not a tissue so you know where it went when he was done. He was wiping and picking ng and wiping and digging and wiping and then... wipe and finally,  back in the shirt pocket! This is in full view of the dining area behind the bar, didn't even turn his back, gag! Then, did he wash his hands? Did he use sanitizer? No! He did stack some plates at the pass thru though! Holy Boogers Batman, it doesn't matter how much I like the food, I am never going back since I cannot be sure proper hygiene practices are followed.  Sad day! #maricopahealthdepartment #gross",

I placed at order at the wrong location (through Grubhub) and was able to cancel it when I realized my mistake (through Grubhub's help, but still - pad see ew doesn't take long to be prepared, and I'm pretty sure it already had been) and place an order at this location instead. The people were gracious and helpful, and the food was made promptly. Honestly I'm a little embarrassed that I caused the inconvenience at all, and very grateful they were so forgiving, between the two locations.  The food is solid! I don't have a wide sample so I guess your mileage may vary, but the prices are imminently reasonable and really my only complaint is I wish I had gotten a little more broccoli.",

Thai Basil was recommended by the front desk and rightfully so!!  We were talking a lot at first, and they came over 2 or 3 times to take our order before we were finally ready, but they were patient and pleasant.  I ended up ordering their Pad Woon Sen with tofu and my friend went with the good standby, Pad Thai with chicken. We were asked how spicy we wanted our food and both said medium. The dishes arrived quickly and were really quite large. The spice level on both was just right and I thought the flavors in mine were right on- everything was cooked properly. We both really liked our dinners, and had so much leftover that we had lunch the next day.   Water refills were frequent and at one point, they just left a carafe of ice water on the table for us. We got there for dinner around 4:10 and were the only table- by the time we left at 6:30, it was hopping! Seems to be a popular eatery near the university.  Oh, and they have good Happy Hour deals on drinks and appetizers from 3-6 every day of the week!",

There have been weeks when my girlfriend and I have eaten here a shameful number of times, simply because the food always tastes fantastic. She gets Pad Thai, I get Panang Curry, and everyone's happy.  But I'm giving Thai Basil four stars because there's one nagging problem: while quality is consistent, nothing else is.  For example, I usually order my meal spicy. Sometimes that means it's pretty mild, sometimes that means it's unbearably hot. Sometimes the noodles are drowned in sauce, sometimes they're fairly dry. Sometimes the plate comes with crushed peanuts on the side, sometimes it doesn't... and then I kind of miss the crushed peanuts. Sometimes the plates are massive (at times, I've been able to spread out one order of Pad Thai over four meals), and sometimes they're not. Sometimes the miso is super-salty, and sometimes it just tastes about as salty as miso usually is. No matter what I order, no matter how many times I go, there's always something about the meal that surprises me.  That being said, those surprises have never spoiled my meal. I've always left Thai Basil satisfied with my choice, looking forward to my leftovers, and happy with the service. No matter what surprises they throw at me, a return visit is almost always guaranteed.",

    "text": "If it was financially possible for me to eat at Thai Basil four times a week, I would, without a doubt.  I will admit that I am not very well versed in Thai food, so I can't comment on whether or not this is authentic. What I can comment on, however, is that it is FREAKIN' DELICIOUS.   I have been to three of the Thai Basil Locations: The one on University (next to Tops Liquor), this one (next to McDonald's on Rural), and the one on Baseline (on the south side of the street). The food has been consistently delicious at all three. The employees are always, always, always friendly. I haven't received anything less than excellent service.  Most recently, we tried the cheese/shrimp egg roll appetizer things (I honestly can't tell you what it was called) -- but holy tastiness, Batman! My boyfriend and I were both really glad that we ordered this.  The Chai Green tea is excellent too. Really refreshing, unsweetened, lots of flavor. Mmm mm mm.  But for me, this place is ALL ABOUT the curry. If you try the red curry (mild for me) or the massman (aka: \"sweet nut\" -- also mild) curry, you will not be disappointed. The red curry comes with your choice of meat/tofu (we always spring for the mixed seafood: scallops, shrimp, calamari) and has a variety of veggies in it too. Yummo.  The massman curry comes with meat/tofu, carrots, potato, and onion slices. The flavor is downright incredible. I don't think I could choose a favorite between the red curry and the massaman curry, but I think I crave the massman curry more (if that makes any sense).  The lunch portions are a nice size, maybe on the small size for some people, but they are perfect for me. At dinner, I always have to get a to go box.  I do recommend ordering dinner for pick up from Thai Basil. The curry comes in this GIGANTIC plastic container, and you get a nice side of rice. And, bonus, the curry container is reusable and can be heated in the microwave. I am beginning to have a stockpile of them.  All in all, Thai Basil is a win. I highly recommend it and cannot wait to go back.",

    "text": "I have had thai basil both in house and as take out. since i live right next to it, i am not sure how it stands up to long distance travel, but, i have always been happy with it when i got it home.   for appetizers, try the fresh rolls, they are one of the better ones i have had in tempe. the spring rolls are also yummy, crisp and fresh tasting.   if you ever have a craving for a strange soup that will clear anything out of your head, be it hangover or sinus infection, try the tom yum. its a spicy lemongrass broth soup with huge chunks of onion, mushrooms, and choice of meat or tofu. I love it with the beef. It is more than a full portion of soup, even if you share it, so come hungry.   the pad thai, another classic choice, is tangy, sweet, and has a kick of spice that is just right. most places seem to use a peanut butter based sauce, but thai basil uses a nice tamarind based sauce and only garnish with peanuts, which are nice and roasted. tofu comes standard, but you can up the amount of tofu or add a meat of choice.   the prices are fair, good sized portions, and great atmosphere when dining in. the service was great, and was always friendly.   and for the adventurous drinker (non alcoholic) try the green tea chai. its bold, refreshing, and makes you just say \"..hmmmmm...\" but in a great way!",

I was disappointed at how extremely dry the noodles were.  So much so, that they were even stuck together and looked like rubber bands, stretching as I tried to eat.    I read some of the other reviews about their large portions and I'd have to disagree...at least with my take out.  I was shocked to see how small the portion was.  Maybe I shouldn't say small...but I guess you could say, \"enough to feed one person\", no second meal with this.  I must mention...I'm not a big eater so when most people say you get two meals out of it, I can usually get three from it.  The portion I brought home was enough for me to have my one meal...absolutely no left overs.  Yah...it was small.  The waitress that served me was very sweet and courteous.  All though I first ordered to sit down and eat in and then had to change it to go...she was very quick to change it and a huge smile on her face.  I still left her a nice tip.  The place is very clean and inviting.  All though I'm a bit disappointed with my chow mien, I'd still give them another try.",

    "text": "No thank you!! My husband and I just moved from Seattle where Thai Food is DELICIOUS! We ordered grub hub Thai Basil last night and it was pretty gross. Huge chunks of carrots and green onions thrown in instead of being thinly sliced in True Thai fashion. Also, very bland. We asked for \"medium spice\" since we wanted to be cautious it being our first time eating at Thai Basil. I kept biting into hard chunks of something...I'm thinking it was just some of the spices that weren't cooked down to soften up? Hmm...Either way I had to spit several bites out after biting down on something mysterious. The beef in my Pad-See-Ew was pretty fatty and the noodles were either way too cooked and kind of grainy or not cooked enough and still hard...My husbands Pad Thai tasted like spaghetti noodles with peanuts mashed up and mixed in. The noodles were way overdone and super mushy. Just not very good. I'm not sure how this place received as high of a rating as it did, but if you've ever had authentic Thai food, don't waste your money thinking that this place will even compare!",

One thing that is really great is they have a lunch special for $6.95 that includes a cup of a vegetable broth soup, entree and egg roll (the menu said \"fruit\" also, but it's really just a slice of orange to drizzle on your entree, which is a nice touch). I think their Thai iced tea is fabulous also. It's a classy place and yet feels very comfortable, and you know it must be good because a lot of people of Asian descent eat here on a regular basis. My favorite dishes are the noodle ones, like pad thai and pad-see-ew, hubby likes the rice dishes, but we both go for the tofu. It's nice to be able to eat totally vegetarian and have a delicious filling meal. If you're like us, you'll go back again and again.",

I enjoy the fried tofu with sweet and spicy sauce, the papaya salad (order it spicy!), the Pad Prik King (green beans, carrots and lemon leaves stir-fried with your protein of choice), and either the Pad Thai or the Pad Woon Sen (glass noodles).

It was very spicy not overwhelming but not Mild at all. Other then the spice there was no real flavor to the curry. There was barely meat I know we split it but we both go like two small pieces.

When she caught me watching her, she moves over to the right to hide so that she can continue her texting conversation. She must have been the owners daughter, because if she was my employee, I would have fired her on the spot. I am serious! the whole time we were there, she was texting.   So we finally I got my meal. The red curry was soooo watered down, one chunk of pine apple, the hot level I requested, HOT! Was mild, and about 5 pieces of chicken. I had to add the cheesy cheap hot sauce to my meal, to make it an almost medium level. ten minutes into my meal, a couple next to us walked out, not too sure why, but I'm sure it had something to do with the lack of service or some \"Employee\" too busy texting to help customers. This is unacceptable, I decided not to return,   But! to Let you all know, watch out! Don't order the red curry, its watered down coconut milk, and and a lack Of meat. What a joke! My homemade curry kicks ass, and doesn't lack any meat! This goes for my local thai restuarnt as well. I've  been there a few times before, why the lack of customer service and the quality of food this time? Not sure, but it only takes one time to turn me off, and this is it, The worst red curry ever. I'm going to my fav local thai restaurant for now on. They get one star, for the available parking.",

I also ordered the Red Curry as usual, which was also good but more than half the rice was over-cooked and mushy.  I got the Coconut Ice Cream w/ Purple Sticky rice as well, and the entire portion of forbidden rice was extremelyy mushy.  Never the case on University.    Worst of all, I took one bite of the forbidden rice and could immediately taste the styrofoam it was served in (think cherry cough syrup ).  Clearly it was placed in the foam when the rice was was too hot.  The ridges inside the bottom of the styrofoam melted into a smooth flat surface, which confirmed my suspicion.  Still trying to get this taste out of my mouth...    I realize you can't always expect the same quality/freshness when ordering to-go, but I order Thai fairly often from numerous places and have never experienced issues like these.  Hopefully it doesn't happen often, I'd like to believe my experience was extreme and could have been much better if I dined in...",

After I was seated, I was immediately brought a cup of cabbage/onion soup. Even tho it was hot outside, the scallions and cilantro kept it light and refreshing.   I ordered an iced tea, shrimp Pad Thai and crab puffs, which came to $19.30 plus tip.   The six puffs came in three mins and I don't think there was crab in the puffs but since it wasn't on the lunch menu, I don't know it they were supposed to. They were light, crispy and full of cream cheese. The lunch came 5 mins later.   The Pad Thai arrived with a small veggie egg roll plus a dipping sauce. The main dish also had marinated tofu, along with the five shrimp. The scallions and carrots were artfully cut and the sauce was classically made. The peanuts were weird, cuz they seemed 'moist' rather than chopped or crushed. Adding in the noodles, bean sprouts, scrambled egg and white onion, there was more than I could eat. Good dish, if lacking shrimp.",

Didn't detect any cilantro or basil in them, which I tend to enjoy, but these were still satisfying: fresh, crispy, julianned vegetables with a bit of chicken. The fish sauce and peanut sauce were ok. Good, but a little one dimensionally sweet - probably for American tastes.   Next up, I had the Thai basil. I requested Thai hot. It came quick on the heels of my fresh rolls and was spicy but not searingly so. Vegetables were vibrantly colored (read: not over-cooked) and abundant, accompanied with a fair amount of chicken. Wasn't as much basil as I would have hoped. Overall it was a nice dish, however.  Service was friendly and prompt. Decor clean.",

The BF had a curry fried rice that he loved and I had a tofu cashew pineapple Thai stirfry on brown rice that was absolutely awesome - I requested my vegetables cooked crunchy they were perfect.  Always love sake bombers - love that they have gluten-free Japanese beer served in chilled mugs - bonus!  Only thing we are sad about was at the coconut ice cream has cows milk in it - bummer :-( it's homemade but maybe they'll be inspired to make it with just coconut milk next time .  Our server, Nitiya was lovely, so helpful and friendly - really added to our experience, made it even that much better - ask for her!  Thanks Thai Basil - we'll be back !!",

My wife, who previous to this restaurant, said \"I do not like Thai food.\" Is now a fan. She loved the eggplant entree.  Our 3 yr old liked the BBQ chicken type dish and our 5 yr old loved the curry.  The waitress was great.  She held our 9 month old baby and walked around showing him off to the rest of the staff, which may be too much for some, but it allowed mom to get a few bites in without him on her lap.  They do have high chairs, but he decided mom's lap was the place for him.  We would definitely do by again, if we were in the area.",

    "text": "I love this chain and I'm a regular at the chandler location. This particular branch however disappointed me on many levels.  I ordered a panang curry with just tofu - Thai hot. The curry as you see in the image attached didn't come with peanuts (usually garnished on top & mixed in the curry). It had no flavor of peanuts, was pretty runny and not as thick nor flavorful as the other branch serves and definitely tasted like mild and not Thai hot.  I addressed my issue to the server regarding peanuts to which they said they can get me peanuts on the side and if there was no peanut garnishing on top it probably isn't panang curry -disappointed as it didn't help in the flavor.  I needed a box to go for the curry & rice. They provided just for the curry. I asked for the box for rice. They didn't even provide a carry bag along with it! The place wasn't really crowded while we were leaving so it's not that they were very busy to mess it up! No apologies whatsoever from them - never returning to this particular branch.  Following day, I still can't eat it as it tastes so bad :(",

The menu was pretty typical for a Thai place and since I'd not been before, I opted for my usual 'litmus' for measuring good Thai. Pad Thai Chicken, 4 stars spicy. ...it was good. Not great, but good. Didn't seem very spicy for 4 stars but next time I'd just tell them to add extra. The portions here are really large, but it seemed like my chicken pad Thai had quite a bit of tofu added as a protein filler. I'd rather have seen a smaller portion as opposed to added tofu for bulk. The taste, texture and presentation was good. It's a decent restaurant and accessible by foot from the hotels and bars nearby.",

Definitely was not spicy enough. Some inconsistency between \"spiciness\" i believe. I added some additional chili flakes after the dish came out.  I still like the flavor that they have. good and medium thickness of the curry sauce. Not the watery kind.   Good amount of food. You'll be full if you finish the entire dish. Comes with a bowl of rice.   environment: plenty of seating in side.  service - fast and short wait time. friendly.

I am not sure if all Thai Basils are affiliated being that I have been to a Thai Basil by my house in Colorado with a similar menu and both have been great.   I always get the Masaman Curry which they do not disappoint. What I can really appreciate from this place is their consistency. I have been to quite a few places in the valley that does not have consistency in their flavors which is the reason I have not returned back. Thai Basil's Thai Iced Tea is also delicious and refreshing which I highly recommend.   The parking for this place is very convenient and I have never found it to be an issue which is great being that sometimes parking around this area can be iffy.

There are other local restaurants with the same name, but this one is superior with regard to recipes (I've been to the one in Chandler and the one nearby on University). I love the Green Curry and also the Massaman, and I've had them with chicken, beef, tofu, and red snapper. The Drunken Noodles are great, as is a family recipe stir-fry dish called Spicy Honey Pork. Pineapple Fried Rice is made better here than anywhere else in Tempe (second place would go to Thai Lahna in Phx). Amazing Tom Kha soup! Seafood pancakes! And then there is the BBQ Pork, or the Crying Tiger (beef which you dip into a wonderful spicy green sauce, served with broccoli and rice). I could go on and on, the basil-intensive noodle dishes or the Larb or the rice paper Fresh Rolls. The Beef Salad is killer, and the homemade Coconut Ice Cream is a good way to end sometimes. The interior is relaxed and music is at a volume which allows conversation. The restaurant is clean, and the servers have always been kind and attentive. Consistency is important, and many of the restaurants in Tempe (of all types) do not serve their customers at such a consistently high quality as Thai Basil Rural (I know...I've been to the other ones).",

The chow mein came in a big portion which was awesome....especially considering the fact that it was the lunch special.  We then ordered the Fried Banana & Ice cream for dessert. Let me just say that I told my fiance he had to learn to make this because it was soooooo freaking good! The ice cream paired with the banana had a nice touch since the banana was fried & warm and the ice cream was cold. Very good!

I've almost always had a good experience with quick service and attentive staff! If you're in the mood to try a curry try the Panang curry! It's sweet yet spicy and goes great over a side of rice. All the dishes we ordered came with cooked veggies mixed in including carrots, red pepper, green beans, broccoli, and much more!   Date night or just eating for 2? Try my personal twist:  My partner and I always order the Chicken Phad Thai and Panang curry. We put the Phad Thai over a bed of rice and drizzle the curry on top for extra flavor. It's my favorite combo and only about $24 after tip! You'll have plenty of left overs.   Great date place or for just a night on the town. They also have a decent selection of beers and other favorite drinks!   Overall a great place to cure that Thai craving!",

The food is the star of the show. Everything I've ever ordered has been delicious. The vegetables are always fresh and crisp. The sauces are savory and seasoned to perfection.   The lunch specials are the best. They start with a veggie broth cup of soup. Then each entry comes with a pile of steamed rice and a mini egg roll.   I can't say enough good about it. So yummy!",

Really good and quick service for either eating in or taking to go ( we have done both). He is in love right now with their chow mein and i as always am a big fan of Pad Thai.  their pad Thai is not as spicy as other places i have been which is ok considering i can spice it up myself if necessary. only downfall for me is i am not a fan t all of their sweet and sour pork which is a big deal for me, since next to Pad Thai that is definitely a second.    Their chicken sa tay and spring rolls are really good as well!  Cheap!",

First time we came here was Happy Hour so they had discounted beers and food. We shared crispy egg rolls, cheese egg rolls, and so Pad Thai. It was all delicious. The cheese rolls were my favorite.  Second time around I had to try their version of my favorite Thai noodle, Pad See Eiw. It was lunch time so they had a special going on starting at $6.95. Lunch menu was simple, pick a noodle, pick a meat, comes with an egg roll. I choose Seafood combo (shrimp, calimari, scallops). Tasty!  If I'm ever in town again, I'd come back.

Ordered 4/5 spicy Tom Yum soup which was salty but neither sour nor spicy to the desired level. 4/5 Spicy vegetable fried rice came out super bland & comparatively lot more stickier than an usual Fried rice. So when we sent back food to add some spice, they sprinkled some hot chili powder on top but still overall the fried rice wasn't tasty. Last but not least, ordered vegetable rice paper rolls which were okay, but the sauces on the side for dipping were terrible.  So overall none of the dishes turned out good & regret coming here for fulfilling my Thai food craze one last time before child birth & starting my post-partum diet after. Oh btw, small thing but surprisingly our soup was the last item which came in much later than the Fried rice ..this never happened to us ever before.",

Their yellow curry is pretty dang good and I always have enough leftovers for the next day. The most recent time we went, we both got the curry but for some reason it was...flavorless. All we could taste was rice. It was definitely strange and it's usually not like that, so we brought it up to our waitress (we're usually non-confrontational, but we literally couldn't taste anything) and she was very apologetic and sweet. Brought us new, delicious bowls of curry within minutes. I'm convinced they must've just made a mistake and forgotten something, but it wasn't a problem, because they're human too. They are always very attentive to our needs and get us food fast, we will keep returning here for our thai food cravings!",

    "text": "As a Tempe retread (my initials are still scratched into several corners on Rural from pavement being poured in 1989 and 90), I am rediscovering a few old favorite places and trying many new opportunities.  Last night, Thai Basil had both star earning and star losing moments.  The \"Gotta have THAI\" monkey popped up on my back early yesterday.  As the love of my life is out of town for a few days and does not have the same passion for Thai that I do, the monkey's timing was good.  Since we are now within Orbit range, I went to my trusty Yelp mobile app and  told it to Thai me.  Thai Basil struck and away I went.  On arriving at 6 PM, there were 5 cars in the lot and on entering, about 20 folks seated at tables enjoying.  The restaurant appears to be clean, though the lighting is dim.  There is apparently a second seating area that I did not explore, so don't hold me to the customer count.  I stood at the door for a moment (in TV terms, a moment is 1 1/2 minutes) and was greeted and seated.  The host handed me a menu and walked away.  I perused the menu for a minute, closed it and started waiting.  5 minutes passed, and I caught the eye of a server who brought appetizers to a table near mine.  She came over and I asked if I could place my order.  She nodded and walked behind the bar, tapped what turned out to be my waiter on the shoulder and pointed at me.  My waiter turned and waved, then walked into the kitchen.  5 minutes later, he came out with his pad and pen.  I ordered Som Tom, the yardstick by which I measure every Thai restaurant, and jasmine rice.  I requested that the green beans and shrimp be left off.  At the menu's suggestion, I ordered Thai Hot.  He wrote down the order and walked away.  I was surprised that there was no request for a beverage order.  I caught the eye of the server again.  She came over and I asked if I could get a glass of water.  She nodded and walked behind the bar, tapped my waiter on the shoulder and let him know about my desire for water.  He turned and waved, then walked into the kitchen.  5 minutes later, he came out with my Som Tom, rice and a glass of water.  He asked if I needed anything else, and when I responded no, he walked away.  Som Tom, properly made, should have lime, chile, palm sugar and fish sauce each of which brings tangy, sweet, salty and spicy notes with the crunch of fresh papaya.  While the portion size was respectable, 2 cups of salad, the seasoning was totally off.  There was no fish sauce or lime that I could detect.  The spice came in at a solid 9 (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes), but without all the notes, this was a bad karaoke version of what should be a great song.  I put my fork down and caught my waiter's eye.  He waved, then walked into the kitchen.  5 minutes later, he came to the table and asked if everything was satisfactory.  When I replied to the negative, he said he was sorry and walked into the kitchen.  A moment later, a lady came to the table and asked about my dissatisfaction.  I asked about missing ingredients in the salad.  She grabbed a fork and tasted, then she said it was very sweet.  She offered to have the order remade.  I agreed, and she took the salad to the kitchen, yelling in Thai that it was not right.  I nibbled on rice and sipped water while the order was remade.  The rice was OK, not too sticky and not too dry.  On the second presentation, the lady (who I found out is the manager) asked me to taste this version.  I tasted, and it was a saltier version of the original.  I could get the sweet, the fish sauce and the spice, but no lime.  I asked if I could get some wedges of lime and she said she would take the order back and have it remade.  By this point, it had been nearly an hour since I had arrived, so I asked for the order to go.   I finished the rice and water while I waited.  Instead of bringing the new order out to the table, the manager waved me over to the bar with a go box.  She had me taste and again, it was below par.  I asked for some lime on the side, only to discover it was juice out of a bottle.  I paid my check and proceeded home.  For the price, $8.95, the time and the multiple attempts, this Thai Basil is not worth the effort.  The contrasts between Thai Basil on University and Thai Basil on Rural are kind of strange.  As I have been made aware, there are 5 Thai Basil operations around the Valley...and being an adventurous sort, I will probably try them all.",

We got the Spring rolls and the Thai fried rice both nights.  The pad Thai and pineapple fried rice were both good, too. We ordered \"medium\" for the spice level - it was maybe a little too spicy for our daughter but a good compromise for one of us who likes a moderate heat level and the other who usually wants the spiciest possible. Great prices for the portions and friendly customer service. We'd definitely come back again.",

I usually bring my friends & all of my out of town family here. The atmosphere is really laid back & chill. The owners Jay & Dee are very welcoming.  I have eaten most things off the menu (except the soup & salads). But my top favorites is the Pad See Ewe, Pad Pik King (with Salmon) & the Yellow Curry. However, all dishes thus far, have been very delicious.  (This review is for the Thai Basil across from ASU, next door to McDonald's)",

Dip your meat in it! -spicy noodles: similar to pad see ew w/diff veggies &sauce -tom yum: -pad see ew -pad thai: automatically comes w/tofu so add diff protein! -spicy fried rice & pineapple fried rice -spicy beef salad -papaya salad -mango with sticky rice  These were all my favorite appetizers & dishes at Thai Basil. I really like how you can pick your level of spice.  I love love love spicy food and can handle my spice very well.. I would usually go with medium or medium+ (btwn medium & hot)   I don't recommend going Thai hot...because that stuff is literally fire!!!   Parking is kind of limited...I remember one summer, the restaurant would get so packed... there were actually customers waiting!",

I have been to nearly every thai restaurant in my area (Thai Rama, Swaddee, Thai Elephant, and many many more..) this is the only place I've ever picked up from that had the white rice separate from the vegetables, sauce, etc.  It was more of a curry style (where the white rice is separate from the curry part) which I was disappointed in. I asked for thai Hot 4 (the spiciest they go) still not spicy or hot.  Barely any red flakes or peppers.  I won't be going back. Was just sub par.  (FYI, the best place I've had Thai food is Thai Rama in Chandler and, on the west side is Line Thai in Sun City)",

Hostess sat me in a rush at a 2-top with no niceties or eye contact. After a very long wait for a drink, a young fellow, presumably a family member of Asian origin, came over to take the full order all at once - would have enjoyed a beer first but whatever. Quickly took the order with zero hospitality and rushed off before I could ask for brown rice rather than white, or another beer. The food was delivered with a quick drop-down and rush-off - no attempt to see if I needed any side condiments or another beer.  No one ever came over to see if I needed anything or liked the food spiciness. I had to flag the boy down to get my second beer.  Having said all that, I had the Thai Basil signature dish, which was quite good with bright veggies and not over cooked.  I would have enjoyed it more with brown rice and a side of chili paste, but never got the chance to request it. The bill was delivered with no thank you, and again I had to flag them down to take the credit card.  While the food was 4-star, the negligent unwelcoming service is at best 2-star.  I noticed another server being quite friendly with her customers so perhaps it's just mom and son who need customer service training - badly.  Sorry to be harsh, but you've got to be much friendlier and hospitable if you want your customer to enjoy the experience of dining here, not just the food.",

It was very good. I got the green curry and it was top 5 on the curry charts. Wouldn't say it was unreal life changing but v satisfying. Pineapple rice with chicken was also very good. Had s sweet taste matched with some spicy paste.   Would def recommend and go back. 4 stars because we were the only ones in the restaurant  and so if I said service was amazing and food came fast just seems biased because it wasn't busy at all. But if you would really good service and really fast food come to you go there at 430 on a Tuesday afternoon.",

Fresh Roll with chick has just tiny portion of chicken in it and they charge this item for 7.50 for three pieces, not worth it at all.  Ordered go to, but there was no paper/plastic plates.  Would not recommend it at all.",

The atmosphere is wonderful, the air is always full of mouthwatering spice aromas, and you can pick literally anything off the menu with a guarantee of deliciousness. The yellow curry with mild spice and tofu is my personal favorite as a vegetarian, the coconut milk based sauce is to die for and pairs nicely with the small spice of the dish. I highly recommend the mango sticky rice for a filling and subtly sweet treat. The staff are also very sweet and exceptionally efficient! I'm a regular and I love it here! Keep up the great work.",

While the location and parking situation may not be ideal for this place, it was not enough to discourage me from taking part in all the wonderful food that Thai Basil had to offer.  From curry to tofu pad thai, your options are only limited by your imagination. I visited this location with a couple of friends and was enamored by the variety of flavors and pairings that were offered. The duck with red curry was absolutely phenomenal. So was the panang curry and pad thai. You can completely customize your order with a protein of your choice (tofu, chicken, beef) and a varied level of spice (medium is spicier than I thought it would be! be careful!)   With every bite I could taste the crisp freshness of every ingredient and flavorful sauces to boot. The portions here are large so if you aren't supremely hungry upon entry, you are sure to go home with some left overs.  The food came out quick and was amazingly flavorful. I can't wait to try some other things off of this amazing menu the next time i'm in town!",

The Chicken Fried Rice was delicious but the Super Spicy Papaya Salad was not even spicy at all, and the portion of papaya in the \"papaya salad\" was so small compared to the other items in the container - lettuce, tomatoes, nuts, green beans, and shrimp. I am not someone who regularly eats spicy food but once in a while I like to try something spicy. I was bracing myself for a spicy salad that turned out to be mild. I complained to GrubHub and was told this restaurant will not refund the salad, and that per the restaurant they included hot sauce in the bag. The only thing in the bag I received were two order plates, napkins, and plastic forks, no hot sauce. Never ordering from this place again. Seems to be run by idiots.",

Happy hour mon-sat 3pm-6pm  3.5 stars   All we wanted to do was to grab something to eat after a long drive from California to Arizona and we found this on rurual road, in Tempe. The exterior may look plain but hey, there's a bar and happy hour happening so why turn around?  What does happy hour have? Well, well , well... 1/2 off appetizers, $2 blue moons and drafts that they carry. And there's specials on selected food.  Got the..  + fresh rolls ($3) chicken - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7N3q70C_mwEYQ2QcGfjvgA?select=N1mhk603JkCFuPZJ58Cxew#mYLsvj4kSTgz7tqwKX07NQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/7N3q...</a>  You get to choose either chicken, beef or tofu. We got the chicken and it was pretty good. The sweet and sour sauce was a bit different from the Thai places I've been to. Usually there's garlic in it, but at Thai Basil, they put chopped up peanuts instead. So if you're allergic with peanuts, best ask for the sauce without the nuts!  + Papaya Salad ($6.25) mild Tasted great! Only sad thing is that we only had one shrimp :(  + red snapper with mixed veggies and bamboo (mild) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7N3q70C_mwEYQ2QcGfjvgA?select=vhgbwyKOgx0caLeacQ1zQQ#pD9KU2uHEGRBQS4H02AJEQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/7N3q...</a> Oh so yummy! Tasted garlic-y and having it over rice is delicious.  + Bluemoons ($2 each)  - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7N3q70C_mwEYQ2QcGfjvgA?select=vhgbwyKOgx0caLeacQ1zQQ#A2vWUeFM6vWyQXZeJJvwEw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/7N3q...</a>   Service - Was great. The ladies who works there are very helpful when we asked what in what and they will let you know what's their special of the day. And yes, there is a bar here. Eat while you drink in front of a big screen t.v.   Overall, not a bad place. I just wished they gave more than one darn shrimp!",

I don't know if it was the food or the company but I had a fantastic time and have been with that very same boy for over 2 years now :-) Good first date choice, Sean R! We probably get take out/dine in at Thai Basil once every week or two. When the new location (within walking distance of home) opened up on Rural I was ecstatic. The owners/waitstaff are always warm, friendly, and inviting. The restaurant is cozy, dark and intimate and the food is amazing with killer prices. I can't begin to describe how much I love Thai food. My favorite dishes are the Thai Basil with chicken or shrimp, Garlic chicken or shrimp, the Red Curry chicken, and the Coconut soup (soooo good!). The spring rolls are amazing as well. I have never had a bad experience...in fact, I think I'll get takeout from Thai Basil this evening, it just sounds so good writing about it!",

    "text": "We went here once a week for the year my husband was in grad school.   The food is a 4, but the waitresses are a 5.   It was a half mile from our apartment and so we would walk there and walk back to work off the huge portions.    This is the only restaurant in my life where I could consider myself a regular.   We never really talked with the waitresses or knew their names, but they always knew what I wanted; I didn't have to order.  They always gave me water with no ice no lemon, my husband's with ice and lemon, gave me my panang curry with chicken medium and waited for my husband to choose what he wanted. He probably ordered most of the items on the menu.  They refilled my rice if I ran out without asking.  Our bill always came to $19.53 for dinner more times than I can remember.  We went maybe twice for lunch, but almost always for dinner.  My husband graduated last month and we moved from Tempe but we miss this place dearly.",
