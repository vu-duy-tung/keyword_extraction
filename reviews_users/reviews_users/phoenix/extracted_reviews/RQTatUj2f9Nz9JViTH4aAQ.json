The price I remember was pretty reasonable.  Honestly, my view of this place may have been colored by the fact that she loved it and said yes.  Good food, AMAZING views, and pretty reasonable definitely adds up to a place I'll visit again",

We were offered delicious focaccia bread with 3 fun spreads to start, while we sipped our drinks and enjoyed the view. We next shared the grilled endive salad.  The grilled endive and pancetta were fabulous atop mandolined fennel and apple in a very light vinaigrette. The tangy salad flavors were deliciously complemented by full flavored gorgonzola.  I enjoyed the hangar steak for an entree. It was perfectly cooked (ordered medium, came medium/medium rare) and seasoned. The beef was well-marbled and tender. Its buttery and char-grilled flavor was beautifully complemented by the smoky tomato basil emulsion that accompanied it. As well, the cauliflower and sherry risotto was rich and layered.     My daughter had the seared free-range roasted chicken. I was invited to taste a bite; it was moist, delicious, and very well seasoned. The accompanying swiss chard and carrots were lovely, and the potato gratin was outrageously delicious.   We shared a fantastic chocolate confection for dessert, as we savored the special meal and continued to enjoy the beautiful evening. Different Pointe of View is a gem!",

    "text": "Top 5 dining experiences in the Phoenix area!  My bf and I went last night, and, from start to finish, it was perfect.  When we arrived, we were seated in a corner with a spectacular view.  We were immediately greeted by one of our three servers, and they were extremely attentive all night.  We shared the pork belly appetizer to start.  They split it without us having asked, and both of our plates were like works of art.  More importantly, the dish was stellar!  We are both hesitant when it comes to pork belly because of the potential to be too fatty, but this was fantastic.  For our entrees, he had lobster on top of some sort of raviolis, and I had hangar steak with risotto.  They were both excellent, but I preferred mine.  It was cooked perfectly and was a good portion size but not overwhelming.  The dessert menu looked great too, but we were stuffed!  So we moved outside and just enjoyed the view with our cocktails for a little while.  I can't wait to go back!",

We started with the short rib ravioli, which was really delicious. The short rib was tender and it came on top of some corn that was sweet and tasty. Definite win with that dish. They also brought out bread with pesto, garlic butter, and a goat cheese dip so that was also fantastic. My only complaint was that the entrees were a little hum drum. I had the hangar steak and my friend had the pork and both were just lacking in overall flavor and both were a little on the dry side (and I ordered mine medium so that's not really expected). Had it not been restaurant week, I would've been upset to have spent as much money as these entrees normally cost. The desserts were also good, we split the turtle and the espresso cup, but they weren't mind blowingly delicious. I would maybe come back here for the view, but the food was not good enough to warrant the price.",

The prices are a little high ($25 - $40 per entree), but it's well worth it and you won't leave disappointed.

They were generous with their portions and even brought us two soups (when we had only asked to split one). The service was also very friendly and knowledgeable.  Our main issue was that the soup we had was WAY too rich (too much creme or butter or something?). It was delicious, but part of the way through, we suddenly felt massively full. We had a hard time eating the rest of our meal and had to bring most of it home. We both had that sick-full feeling throughout the rest of the night. Maybe it was just us, as we normally eat healthy, so it might have been a shock to our stomachs. Otherwise though, the food was very good!",

I had the Scallops and hubbie had the halibut -- both really, really good.  We shared the citrus almond/honey cake and it was nice... but next time, we'll go for the flourless chocolate instead.

    "text": "What can I say?  I just can NOT be disappointed with this restaurant!  We've been going for over 15 years, have gone for New Years, birthdays, anniversaries and countless other special occasions and they've never dropped the ball. Not once!    The view?...Even if you're in a miserable mood this amazing mountain top floor-to-ceiling panoramic view will make you feel like all the stars in the sky are set out over the valley just for you.  It is incredibly relaxing, breathtaking, romantic and makes for beautiful pictures!   The food....well, I must be honest, I'm not sure how the menu fares as we don't even read it...we've only ever ordered the chef tasting menu, but I've never been let down. In fact, I get so excited when we make reservations it's all I think about for days. They do ask if you have food allergies, but be warned, if you're not up for trying new foods or eating favorites in creative, inventive, non-traditional combinations this might be too much of an adventure for you:) That being said, I suggest \"Live a little\", try new things and allow this artist of a chef to take you on a flavor ride.  He will convert you to allow someone else to take the wheel.  The beauty of the plates, the flavors and combinations are always memorable...  This particular evening we started with pan seared foie gras on top of French toast with a chestnut smear and huckleberry jam.   Our second course was a light and crunchy breaded soft shell crab with a frisee salad tossed in lemon vinaigrette and dotted with fried slivers of jalapenos.    Course 3 was an impeccable pan seared diver sea scallop atop a lobster Parmesan risotto cake served with lobster knuckles, caramelized shallots and (I believe) rapini.  4th course was pistachio crusted rack of lamb with natural lamb jus reduction over a celery root puree and, spinach and roasted chanterelle mushrooms.   Dessert was a 4 piece sampler per couple.  1.) a citrus bread pudding (mandarin ?) 2.) a s'more type layered chocolate and marshmallow cake 3.) traditional cream brulee with berries 4.) an amazing combination of peanut butter, chocolate and banana...don't know what it was, but we almost fought over it and it was gone too quickly to break it down, but if you get a choice (as sometimes we have been offered during the tasting) get the peanut butter, banana & chocolate dessert...all of us agreed!    The wine...well, they have many many many choices and I'm sure you can find your favorite, but why not let your server/sommelier make a pairing to the chef's menu?  I've experienced many wines I might not have bothered to try, and, as an interesting twist, several didn't care for when poured, but fell in LOVE with when the course pairing arrived. What a gift they have to elevate both the food and the wine!  I wish I had written down the wines from this evening, but my phone was not charged, so I am going without pics and from memory (which got fuzzier following 4 glasses of wine;)). Many of the food courses had extra oils, drizzles and smears as well that made for unctuous bites, but again I apologize for the lack of \"notes\" taken.  First was a sweeter round white from France, second was a crisp, fruity (pear/Apple) white akin to a Pinot Grigio from Italy, third was a Chardonnay from California and fourth was a cotes de rhone (blend of Grenache/Syrah). Again, I apologize for no names.   The service...I've always felt service is at LEAST 1/2 of your dining experience. I cannot say enough about the atmosphere created here. They make you feel special without being stuffy. We joke around with the staff and are always made to feel comfortable.   If you ever get the chance to splurge on a special meal, I HIGHLY recommend this as an all around amazing experience.   Compliments to the chef and the entire staff at Different Pointe of view...I look forward to the next time I'm lucky enough to return!",

While the view was still amazing (and we were awarded with a fantastic window seat), the food wasn't that great. We ordered two apps, both of which were quite good but in my opinion you can't really go wrong with anything pork belly or anything to do with burrata. The entrees were pretty bland though. One member in our party even requested that they be brought salt, always a bad sign. I sampled everyone's food (for science of course), and the duck was probably the worst - bland risotto and a poorly cooked duck leg. My steak was passable, although the sides were a bit cold. I feel I've had a tastier steak at a chain like Ruth Chris. I would probably return here and sit on their patio for the view and a cocktail, but I don't think I'll be returning to spend top dollar for their dinner.",

    "text": "This is an upscale restaurant located in the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort. If you're looking to impress your date, celebrate a birthday or anniversary, this is the place! The food was amazing, service was impeccable and the view was just breathtaking. I came here with the PHX Yelp family, that recently adopted this Nashvillian, during Restaurant week earlier this year. They offered a 3- course Prix Fixe at $40 which was very affordable for what you get. My dearest Mike D. and I shared our selections: Guacamole, can't remember what the other app was (sorry), pork tenderloin, seared ahi, creme brulee and chocolate mousse. Everything was delicious...except for the pork tenderloin; I found it to be a bit on the dry side.   Different Pointe of View will always hold a special place in my heart.",

We went during the off season on a summer holiday so maybe that was a factor. Our waiter asked us what we wanted to drink and hadn't given us a wine or cocktail list. The food was mediocre. We got the prix fixe. The verjus infused watermelon salad was bland and the verjus just made the fruit seem like it had gone bad. The lobster bisque was so so with no lobster meat in sight. The shrimp I had was a bit rubbery and over cooked. Overall it was just ok. It isn't the fine dining it's trying to be. No matter how big and white your plates are it doesn't make up for taste. I'd go back to enjoy the view at the bar below instead.",

The pastry chef, Lara, created a scrumptious scratch vanilla with fresh berries cake which was too die for!  The atmosphere and of course the view were spectacular elements of our special evening.

    "text": "Delicious food and an amazing view of Phoenix!!  I will start off from the beginning of our experience. I made reservations for mine and my husbands one year anniversary. We were not seated until 20 minutes after our reservation time which was a little frustrating. Once we were seated (in front of an incredible view), we didn't get water or a menu for about 7-8 minutes which was awkward. All up from here though... Our waiter was very friendly and guided us through the menu and provided us with recommendations. At one point, my husband mentioned it was our on year anniversary so a few minutes later the waiter brought out a complimentary appetizer...lobster bisque! Very delicious and the perfect portion. For our entree, my husband ordered the short rib and I got the beef tenderloin. Both dishes were amazing but my tenderloin...oh my juicing beefiness! It was cooked perfect; medium rare in the inside with a nice crisp char on the outside.  For desert, we ordered the peanut butter chocolate which comes with house made banana ice cream. Drool, drool, drool! Another amazing dish! They even put a piece of chocolate in the desert that read \"happy anniversary\".  Next visit I will be bringing my in-laws from Oregon!",

    "text": "A Disappointing Pointe of View Let me start out by saying that the meal we had here was outstanding, and our server Brian was great. Unfortunately, the topmost selling point of this restaurant is supposed to be the sunset view. They did, after all, name the place for the view. That is the main reason we came here to celebrate a special occasion, and I made a reservation a month ahead of time.   We were seated in what is likely the worst seat in the place, in the east corner. There was not much of a view, my wife's view was the mountain behind the restaurant and a huge red pillar, but I had a view of the east valley. That only got worse when a party of 40 or so people arrived and stood out on the patio for the entire evening. Our \"lovely view\" was that of 20 butts, all lined up to watch the valley view. Other tables are positioned where the patio descends, so they got to see heads. Very disappointing.   But the food was wonderful, fine presentation and a pleasing blend of flavors. Would I go back? Meh. There are so many fine restaurants in the Phoenix Scottsdale area, I think we will continue exploring them.",

The directional signs to guide you to your destination are non-existent.  However, once you reach your destination, you're in for a real treat.  The restaurant is perched on top of a ridge that overlooks part of the Phoenix Valley.  The view is spectacular!  The food is great too.  There was passed hors d'oeuvres at the beginning of the event that were very tasty.  Then just before the main speaker began, we were all seated for lunch.  We were served a Petite Filet and some Veggies with a light Citrus Salad as an appetizer.  Both were very good.  The servers were great.  They kept our water and Iced Tea glasses full throughout the lunch and promptly took away our dishes after each course.  For dessert, we had Cheesecake topped with Berries...it was delish!  Overall, it was a very good luncheon.  If they hold one here again, I will definitely attend.  I will also come back for a dinner with The Better Half.  Return Factor - 88%",

Although I do get food when I am there, they change the menu often so i don't feel it's fair to review food that won't be on the menu in a few months.  I have been going here for five years now and I never get sick of it.  They have a fabulous wine list and one of the most breathtaking views in all of Phoenix.  This place is a hidden gem and I'm always amazed when people say they have never heard of it.  The bar/lounge is completely walled with glass so you can see the city view from any seat within the bar/lounge.  The seating outside is a fabulous set up.  You can sit in a circle seating area around a fire pit, at a communal couch area, or at separate tables right at the edge of the mountain.  There is also a hidden seating area off to the West side that gives you a completely different view of the city.  Sometimes in the winter the chef will make homemade marshmallows infused with different liqueurs.  The cocktail servers will give you sticks to roast your marshmallows at the fire pit and they also provide different dipping sauces.  This is one of my favorite times of the year!!!  Don't miss out if you are there in the winter time!  The only complaint I have about this place is that it can be rented out so it is frequently closed for private parties.  ALWAYS CALL AHEAD TO  FIND OUT IF THEY ARE OPEN!  The staff is always amazing.  Bill, the manager, is always making sure you are enjoying your visit and April and Richard down at the Terrance Room are fabulous!   Don't miss out on a drink and view at the Terrace Room!",

Not only was their staff very hospitable but we greatly enjoyed our meal, and of course, the view.   This restaurant on the mountain oversees Phoenix and could not be a more beautiful location for dinner.  Our meals were fantastic. I enjoyed the tasting menu, and she tried the steak and lobster, which was amazing. After our meal, we spent some time on the patio, which is well equipped with seats, fire places, and heaters.  Overall, a wonderful evening with my Love and an excellent dining experience.",

    "text": "Not just your average review.  Great story and example of how good the service is...even when your not the diner.  I wanted to do something really nice for two of my friends on Valentine's day.  One problem though, they live in Arizona and I'm in California.  I know! I'll send them to dinner...wait, but where?  I have no knowledge of the restaurant scene in AZ.  So naturally, I jump on Yelp and start looking up restaurants.  Different Pointe of View comes up and it looks like a fantastic choice.  I check with one of my friends (she is in on the surprise) and turns out this is one of their favorite places to eat.  They are both foodies so that told me immediately that the food must be excellent.  So I found a place, but how do I arrange this so that everything goes smoothly?  Enter Catlyn, the hostess who answered the phone when I first called.  I explain the situation and what I would like to happen.  I was expecting something to the tune of \"I am sorry sir but we cannot accommodate a request like that,\" or something of that nature.  Catlyn responded enthusiastically to this idea and said she would email me the correct form to fill out so that dinner would be taken care of.  She then took my reservation for my two friends and assured me that they would be well taken care of.  Within hours the form was in my inbox.  I filled it out, preselected a bottle of wine off of the website and faxed it back to the restaurant.  Catlyn responded to each and every email correspondence  I sent her regarding my requests as well as making sure her managers were aware of the situation.  Her enthusiasm and professional manner made me feel at ease with regards to how the evening would unfold.  I knew there was only so much I could do from California so I was reliant upon people I have never met.  I spoke with Catlyn on the phone once again to confirm the reservation and that everything was in place.  She assured me everything was good to go.  I was trusting the staff and the restaurant to come through for me.  A Town Car (not arranged through the restaurant FYI) picked up my two friends on Friday and drove them to Different Pointe of View.  Friday evening came, hours later so did the phone call.  Just hearing how happy and surprised they were on the phone assured me that they had a tremendous dining experience.  They said the food was \"amazing\", the service was \"incredible\" and that they could not have had a better evening at dinner.  Their experience held True to every promise that Catlyn had made, and in turn made me me feel like the trust I placed in the restaurant was more than respected.  The restaurant went above and beyond.  I could not of been more pleased.  I am so thankful to Catlyn and the staff at Different Pointe of View who played a part in my little surprise.  Thank you for helping me bring joy to two special ladies.  The way the evening went made me feel like they were just as important to the staff as they are to me.  Next time I am in Phoenix I will be stopping by to say hello and enjoy the food for myself, because I already know it is excellent.  Bravo DPOV!",

    "text": "This is the place to go to if you just want to have a drink and sit, look out over the Valley and relax!  My new go to place definitely! The only downside here is the parking.  You park yourself, and when you step out of the car the ground is slanted which makes your brain feel like you are somewhat drunk...very weird feeling.  Then you huff and puff up the hill to the location...not that hard but I like to be dramatic. The building is 32 years old they told me, but, to me, looks older because of the design.  It is lovely, tho, and very serene. I had parked at the end where the parking lot ends facing the hill going down.  Now comes the fun when you leave.  You gotta go into reverse cause if you go into drive you shoot over the parking lot, down a super steep hill and kill yourself.  So, it's important you go into reverse, turn your car around carefully because all the smart people parked in the rows back of you and slowly get out of the parking spot.  Once you do that and straighten the car out it's literally all downhill...not scary once you get out of that parking spot. The head Manager of the restaurant have big delivery trucks that are scared to drive up there.  I get it totally with a big truck! Saturday night had a steady stream of couples coming in to sit, have a drink and stay for a little while before dinner (I guess).   Like I said, this is my new go-to place.  Very pretty, very serene--not cheap as my martini was like $13 or so--but so worth it just for the view and sitting pleasure.",

We chose to eat outside which was taking a chance because when the sun went down it got cold pretty fast. I would have thought they would have had some heaters outside. Both the service and food were outstanding. We never felt rushed and we were given great suggestions for food. We also received information about the mountains and areas around the property. The restaurant is high up the hill so make sure you keep following the signs to the restaurant. There is also a great lounge area and we were planning on having an after dinner drink there but it was so cold inside, we had to leave. The restaurant was very cold also. I would have never been able to sit there and and enjoy my meal. We so wish we could have stayed to enjoy more time there. Hopefully they will take care of this.",

I had the Lobster Bisque out on the terrace with my friend, and I must say it was the worst I have experienced. It tasted like a pudding (very sweet), with a dash of chili powder, and minute slivers of lobster. The price should have commanded a great Lobster Bisque. It prevented me from ever considering dinner there, even though the view is as beautiful as any place I know in Phoenix. Sorry about the delay in writing a review, but due too many bad food experiences with sizeable price tags, I have decided to speak the truth about food. If we all say nothing, bad becomes the order of the day.",

    "text": "Tim Robbins was our server!!!  Just kidding, it was really Corey, but the resemblance was pretty amazing. Anyway, I had a fantastic dinner here the other day which started off with a delicious glass of  Seghesio Zinfandel ($12) and an amuse bouche that was some sort of minty-pea gazpacho soup. Both delicious, leaving me excited for the rest of the meal.   For my appetizer I got their Hydroponic Butter Lettuce Salad ($13) which was super tasty with the caramelized nectarine dressing. I found the the toasted pistachios one of the best parts of the salad as it helped offset the sweetness from the dressing, which was always a yummy experience in my mouth. The bread service came with choices between a foccacia and a mild sourdough to try with their three different spreads consisting of a goat cheese olive oil emulsion, some sort of pepper pesto olive oil, and a spicy butter mixture. The pepper pesto spread was the table favorite.  I ordered the Grilled Cedar River Marinated Hanger Steak ($32) that come atop a scrumptious basil blue cheese risotto mixed with chopped portabella mushrooms and drizzled with a roasted tomato garlic olive oil emulsion. Oh my gosh, so good! I was debating between the Hanger Steak or the Featured Risotto, but get the steak because you get the best of both worlds! My lovely date ordered Pork Tenderloin Noisettes ($26) that wasn't nearly as exciting as my entree, but still good.  Dessert time left us trying the Classic Creme Brulee ($9) and Apples on the Rocks ($9). The creme brulee was the typical rich taste, but it came with a buttermilk blue cheese cookie! Oh man, that led to another party in my mouth with the combo of sweet and salty goodness. The Apple dessert came in a lowball glass (get it, \"on the rocks\") which was pretty cute. It came with a scoop of apple spice ice cream and a scoop of vanilla cream ontop of an oatmeal cranberry cookie and drizzled with caramel. It was good, but the blue cheese cookie was really memorable so I recommend getting the brulee for that reason.  The restaurant is located on the top of North Mountain in North Phoenix with floor-to-ceiling glass windows. This creates a fantastic view overlooking Central Phoenix from wherever you are seated in the restaurant (but if you can, request to be my the window). Also, try and come around sunset because its really neat to see the transition from day to the sparkly lights at night. There is a patio that would be fun to dine at when the weather is cooler. I find the prices to be extremely fair with portions and taste, so don't let that deter you from trying this restaurant.  Five stars for impeccable service by Tim Robbins, aka Corey, quality tasting food, and, of course, the view! I want to come back very soon!",

I had the Corn Quinoa but tried the Stonefish from others with me, and it was incredible. The desserts are pretty small, not really sharing size so keep that in mind. As for prices, most entrees are around $30 and most desserts are around $10.  The only negative was the scotch and whiskey selection. It was very small. For instance, I wanted a Glenmorangie 21 but they only had bottles aged much less.  Tip: How to get all the way up here, when you enter the Hilton follow the little signs, they will take you all the way up and continue until you see \"Public Parking for Different Pointe of View.\"",

My suggestion is to arrive early enough to do this before your reservation time.   Once inside at dinner, we requested window seating.  It was nice to look over the city while enjoying the meal. From salad, to steak, to dessert the meal was delicious.  I truly can offer no complaints about the service, atmosphere, or meal. Even if you aren't staying at the resort, you should definitely find time to eat here during your Phoenix stay. It was well worth the cost.",

My only disappointment was I made reservations for 10 people for my husband's birthday.they sailed to even acknowledge the slightest little card or complimentary dessert or anything to celebrate his special occasion. this was a big disappointment as many other restaurants we could have gone to do acknowledge celebrations.I know I could have ordered a cake three days prior however life just got in the way and I forgot to order but I just assumed that something special would have been at his management should know that this is not a good way to get future business.  The other issue was that nine of our dishes were incredibly delicious, very well done but the birthday boys short ribs fell short of that. He stated that it was very dry and although he tried to moisten it in the sauce he just couldn't eat anymore. When he informed the waiter of such, nothing was done to rectify this.",

The beef carpaccio was light and perfectly dressed, the beet salad with gorgonzola was refreshing and the perfect setup for our entrees...scollops and port tenderloin...both of which were prepared to perfection and delicious. Ohhh and the lemon drop martini was the perfect blend of sweet and tart and the Spanish white a perfect pairing for the scallops. Overall a wonderful evening...great company, beautiful restaurant, great food and caring and attentive service. Very happy with my first visit to Different Point of View!",

We decided to get a drink on the lounge downstairs before we went up stairs for dinner, the bartender was very nice and personable I asked for a lemon drop martini that o haven't had for years .. It was amazing . When we went upstairs we had an amazing table right by the window to overlook the twinkling city lights . The food was delicious , you could tell the chef is amazing with his pairings and preparations .. I had the scallops which were the size of my head lol and my husband had an amazingly marinated and flavorful filet that was prepared to perfection ... What can I say even my vegetables tasted incredible like they were marinated before hand . The staff was on top of everything .. Took away my plate I said thank you .. \"With pleasure\" the bus boy states \" no really thank you\" I say \" no no it's my pleasure o love to clean\" he says lol what a great staff very on point and ready to cater to your ever need. The  architecture is very beautiful .. So after dinner we decided to visit the many fountains and check out the scenery . We just had a really great time on the rare occasion that we do go out .

I had the seared fish and my husband had the filet mignon.   For dessert we had the peanut butter with banana icecream.

First off, the restaurant can boast 5 star views of the Valley...truly stunning!  The service was quite good too...everyone that came by the table was professional and friendly.  The decor is actually quite dated when you really look at it...however, you are so distracted by the view that you barely notice.  The food was 2 stars at best and quite disappointing.  We started with the pear and butter leaf salad (best food of the night) and the lobster bisque (my husband said it tasted burnt), continued on with the pork chop (dry and chewy) and the fish special (overcooked with rice that was crunchy) and finished with the carrot cake (something crunchy other than nuts in there...not sure what that was) and the peanut butter chocolate mousse (hard, didn't taste at all like peanut butter and appeared to be full of sugar/caramel in the center).  In my opinion, they need to step up their food game in order to be competitive with the many first rate restaurants in the Valley!",

Entree that my spouse had (bistro steak) was tender and juicy. My entree, however, was --- eh.  I ordered the vegetarian plate, and with all the wonderful vegies and creativity of this kitchen, I got pasta with a tomato sauce and a few roasted vegies (the vegies were terrific).  Really?  There are so many creative ways to put a great vegetarian dish, and I got pasta with tomato sauce??  So disappointed.  That said, the dessert was great, the views wonderful, staff awesome.  Just up the vegie plate!!!!!",

    "text": "After hearing about the dazzling views, wonderful food and intimate atmosphere, I'd be saving my first trip to DPOV for a special occasion. When two of our closest friends announced that they'd be moving to California, we decided that the perfect occasion had arisen!  The location feels secluded and tucked away, but rest assured - the rumors about those views are True! Even on a cloudy night, it was beautiful. We walked the gorgeous, landscaped grounds a bit and continued up the stairs to the restaurant, where we were seated at an indoor table overlooking the city. Immediately, we decided that a bottle of wine would be the perfect call to kick off our farewell, and shared a lovely pinot noir. (Anticipating their raved-about steaks, of course.) We kicked off the evening with some fresh oysters that were fantastic! Each of us ordered a steak, and I asked for mine to be medium-rare. Unfortunately, my steak was pretty overdone, and while I indicated this cutting into it, I said I'd go ahead and accept it, as I hate to send food back unless it's inedible. The waiters were kind enough to make this up to me with a free dessert that was delicious! The waiters, too, deserve a shout-out for being absolutely wonderful and keeping our glasses (and bellies) full!  After dessert, we strolled around the patio, and went down a level to check out the beautiful fire feature. I'd definitely recommend this place for a special occasion... it was a lovely way to wish our friends well before their move!",

    "text": "My Wife and I were taken out to dinner to here by another couple that is friends of ours as a thank you.  Oh was it a thank you. We started out with drinks on the patio while we waited for our table reservation to start.  The view across Phoenix was exceptional.  The drinks where nothing special, as we started with some beers, and my wife a Santa Margherita Pino Grigio. The ambiance outside was fantastic as we had a reservation for 7 that allowed us to enjoy the Famous Arizona sunsets.  Once our table was ready, we continued to enjoy outside for a bit longer.  It was fantastic to just sit, relax, and commiserate with our friends with out feeling rushed into our seating. After going in, we were at at a table next to the window, the only issue with the seating was that their was a small but powerful light shining down into my eyes at table position 2, but our server Ian was more that happy to fix it by turning the ambient lighting down in the entire restaurant so it wasn't grating on my vision. The dinner was started with drinks, Crown Royal Cask no16 for me, beer for My friend and his wife, and my wife was still working.on her 500ml bottle of Santa Margherita. We ordered a full 5 course meal.   My wife and I split the Seared Berkshire Pork Belly as my appetizer, the other couple had the Sweet Italian Sausage and Fresh Mozzarella Raviolis.  The arrived hot, and Fresh.  The flavor was incredible, and the presentation a master-piece. I then had the Belgium Endive with Blood Oranges.  I will say that this was in fact one of the best salads I have ever had.  I ended up sharing a leaf with each of my friends and wife just so they could taste it. We took a short break from dinner, talked, order more drinks (beers for all of us except my wife who had a Stella Red), and then shortly after dinner was presented.  I say it was a presentation, as again, the attention to detail and visual aesthetics that went into the plate presentation where astounding. I had the Rosemary Sented Grilled Venison Tenderloin.  This was cooked to a perfect medium-rare, sliced into medallions, then placed on what could be described as sweet potato hash browns.  The Port Demi Glace was just perfect.  The presentation was beautiful, but the flavor was incredible! Both woman ordered the grilled New York Strip Steak.  My wife had her prepared Black & Blue.  For those of you who don't know, this is difficult to do as it is blacked, but not charred on the outside, & only slightly warm on the inside.   Blackened not charred  means the meat is crispy, but no large hunks of carbon hanging on the outside of the steak.  It is absolutely fantastic when done correctly, and can be a pit fall and ruin the steak when done poorly.  This was the epitome of a Black & Blue steak.  Perfection.  My friend's wife had hers medium-well, and while not my cup of tea, it was still very moist and tender, but deep read in the center.   My friend had the Brandy Vanilla Poached Maine Lobster.  It was also just fantastic.  The lobster was silken in texture, not a single rubbery or chewy bit.   For dessert the women split the Chocolate and Sweet Basalmic Cherry Cake.  It was gone almost as soon as it hit the table top. I had the Warm Cinnamon Bread Pudding.  It was good, but the sauce was really what made it.  Wasn't fond of the partially spun sugar that it was topped with, but only becuase it was the ONLY part of the meal (the garnish on the desert that is) that felt not 100% authentic, but kind of short cut.  (It was done on a mat instead of the traditional hanging style that I would have preffered).  But seriously, that how nitt-picky you have to be to find something wrong with our meal. You have to decide that a completely subjective choice by the pastry chef wasn't the best call.  Seriously though, it was very good.  The coffee after the meal was good.  Strong, some what acidic, but not bitter.  My wife drank it black while I needed just a touch of cream.  Over all, the quality and presentation of the food at Different Point of View, as well as the exceptional service provided by Ian made it THE most memorable date, let alone double date I have ever been on. We will be back.",

At any rate I was here for my birthday dinner with four other girlfriends this past Friday.  The company I was with was worth five stars in itself along with the view. Our server was friendly although preoccupied and quite busy. It took awhile to receive menus when we sat down which was a little odd but we shrugged it off. We ordered two bottles of the Arizona Stronghold wine, the duck confit ravioli, pork belly, short ribs, steelhead trout, filet, and the pork tenderloin. Holy cow the food (all of it) was absolutely amazing. Even the bread along with the three different dips for it was delicious.  We shared all of our dishes and everything was melt in your mouth good and succulent.  The pork belly really did melt in your mouth and the sauce..oh my we were fighting (playfully) over dipping our bread in the sauce. My steelhead trout was the best I have had to date. I was so full but I made sure to eat every last bite (my stomach was not happy with me). All the other ladies throughly enjoyed their meals as well. How we actually had room for dessert I still have no idea but we all took one for the team and ordered dessert as well. I was surprised with a happy birthday creme brulee from the chef which was just as heavenly as the rest of my meal. The wine,  the company, the food, the service  (once things slowed down) was perfect. I cannot wait to come back again!",

We couldn't even eat our dessert as we were too stuffed. I believe it's 97.00 per person.   Considering the food, the ambiance, exceptional service plus the amazingly beautiful views, it's worth every penny. Perfect for a birthday, anniversary, or celebration of any sort.  Have a cocktail one level below at the cocktail lounge and soak in the view.  Let the stress dissipate and enjoy the company you're with.",

I had the duck ravioli as appetizer, diver's scallops for entree, hubby got the beef fillet and all were so divine!! We had our 4 year old with us and the kid's menu isn't on the list, but your server will let you know. Our daughter had the steak fillet with fries and omg it was really good too lol. The presentation was beautiful as well. Thank you for making my husband's 29th wonderful.",

To start with our table was right by the window and overlooked the gorgeous view of Phoenix at dusk...Appetizers were amazing!  Pork belly, ravioli, white truffle risotto and oysters were the selections. Followed by our delectable entrees! The short ribs were out of this world and the Steelhead w/shrimp risotto was melt in your mouth. Followed by a special anniversary dessert and we added the creme brulee-delicious! The service of the waitstaff was impeccable; This was definitely a 5-star experience and will return!",

Bisque was too rich and of one note for my palate. The wagyu beef cheek was amazing!!! I had to use the knife to cut the cauliflower, but not the beef! It was fork tender and melt in mouth. Entree was duck confit risotto and grilled salmon with basil risotto cake ( chefs daily feature). Duck was good but nothing memorable. The salmon was terrific! It was accompanied by a smokey sauce which elevated the dish to top notch. Dessert was chocolate espresso mouse with orange sabayon. It was not as remarkable as it sounds. Next dessert was almond cake with strawberry rhubarb sauce. This was pretty good and was fun to eat. The atmosphere and view was so peaceful and amazing. Would have given 5 stars but the service was a bit underwhelming and the desserts did not surprise me. So have to settle with 4 stars. Definitely worth for $44 per person.",

    "text": "This place has simply gorgeous views of Phoenix. Two levels of this restaurant have extensive glass panoramas that take advantage of the height of the hill on which the restaurant sits.  That being said, the high prices of this restaurant make you think you're getting haute cuisine, outstanding customer service, in addition to the beautiful vistas. This unfortunately fell short with us.  While the food was very well executed, the menu was predictable and dull. We had the venison and the filet. Both were cooked to perfection. The portions were smaller than I had expected, and the desserts were even smaller than I thought possible. For the money I was charged,  I would expect a small, yet satisfying portion. I'm NOT a big eater by a long shot, but had I come in hungry, I would've left hungry, even after appetizer, entree and dessert.  The service was satisfactory for a cheaper restaurant. At these prices, I had expected superior service. We were left waiting for 10 minutes after we finished our appetizers before the server took our order for dinner (we spaced our dinner out and didn't order everything up front). The server didn't ask us if we wanted additional cocktails either. We received better service from the runners than we did our server.  All in all, this is a great place to go for a special occasion, but if you want superior service, reasonable portion sizes, and interesting menu, go to Elements at Sanctuary. The view isn't as \"good\" but it makes up for it in all other ways. Or consider Orange Sky at the Talking Stick. Julio there gave us the best service we've had since moving to the valley.",

My only complaint is that the Manhattan I started with, their West of Manhattan, didn't taste much like rye whiskey and was a bit too sweet for me.  Other than that, Luis recommended both the pork chop on the menu and the pork tenderloin addition and we ordered both.  Fantastic.  The wagyu beef cheek appetizer was melt-in-your-mouth.  We asked if we could sit on the balcony for our dessert and coffee to enjoy the view and quietness and they accommodated.  This place is a must, you won't regret it.  Ask for Luis and tip the man a whole bunch, he deserves it",

    "text": "I came here with my two sisters a couple weeks ago and all three of us agreed it was one of the best experience dining experiences any of us had ever had. We had gotten a limousine so that we didn't need a DD but we were disappointed when the driver informed us he would have to drop us off at the resort so we could take a shuttle to the top (the road is too steep and narrow for a limo). The friendly shuttle driver told us that this is a common surprise to groups coming for special occasion parties like the prom. So, just something to be aware of. Once we got up to the top, it really did feel like the place was built right into the mountain top. You can see the exposed rock of the cliffside surrounding the entrance. It was very cool. We rode an elevator to the top floor and you could see why they wanted to be as high up as possible. The view was stunning. I am sure it would be gorgeous at sunset but this was around 8pm and I personally really enjoyed being able to see all the city lights shimmering below us. The design of the restaurant is upscale but understated; they keep everything neutral so that the large wall of floor to ceiling windows is the main focus.  We decided to do the tasting menu and I am so glad we did. It was worth every penny ($80pp plus $40 for wine). The portions were a decent size and every one was delicious and unique. My sisters requested no shellfish or veal (and unfortunately I had to comply) so the chef substituted two of the dishes with something else. Our waiter was very diligent about making sure that we were all happy. We started with a piece of pork belly with wild mushrooms on a bed of bleu cheese polenta. This was a surprising first course (I think it was supposed to be shrimp) but I loved it! The pork melted in my mouth and I loved the tangy bleu cheese mixed with the creamy polenta. We had gotten the wine pairing as well so the sommelier made his appearance and explained that since we were changing up the dishes he was changing up the wines as well. He selected a very light red that had enough tannins to complement the pork and the cheese but was still light enough for a first course. This wine is not on their list but he had a couple bottles that he was trying out himself and he picked that one for us since he knew it would go with the dish that the chef had changed around for us. I couldn't believe how accommodating the staff was to their guests and how coordinated and educated they were. Second course we got a Pillsbury Rose which was also fantastic and the sommelier told us all about the history of this local winery and some stories about the AZ wine culture in general. It was awesome. The wine went perfectly with the salad we were served of assorted micro-greens with fresh currants and a tangy, fruity vinaigrette. A nice surprise was that under the greens were some hamachi sashimi. The fish was delectable and the salad was an explosion of flavors. I love dried currants in baked goods and currant jam but I have never in my life even seen a fresh currant, never mind bunches of them still on the vine. It was very cool! The next course was the fish course, accompanied by a crisp white blend. I am not a fan of sea bass but this one was cooked perfectly and it was a different type that was pink like salmon. I confess it did not convert me to being a sea bass lover but I loved the vegetables it was served with so much that I scraped up the remaining sauce with the rest of the bread in the bread basket (which was a very tasty focaccia, btw). The last course was the highlight of the whole experience. It was medallions of venison tenderloin. They were well-done (which is how I like my meat) but still completely fork-tender. The sauce for this dish was equally delectable, a sweet red wine reduction. The flavors in this dish were fantastic and the portion size was so large that my sisters had to take half of theirs home. The wine for this dish was a wonderful red that was so amazing I am going to go hunt it down and I will buy at least one bottle no matter how much it costs. I managed to save a bit to go with my chocolate cake dessert. The cake was good but it also came with a small cup of a super-thick and creamy hot chocolate that was out-of-this world. I thought it was great that we each got to pick our own dessert but my sisters both ended up not caring for theirs. One ordered the Apples on the Rocks, which is the one all the Yelpers raved about but it was completely tasteless and boring. It tasted like they had messed up and forgotten a few ingredients (like sugar?). My other sister ordered the chocolate and chestnuts dessert which was at least passable but somewhat blah. The boring desserts were not a big deal, though, since by that point we were sooo full!  It was such a fantastic experience from start to finish I really think this is one of those places every Phoenician must go at least once. Great food, great service, great ambiance. I highly recommend!",

    "text": "Short and sweet: My experience at POV is a really mixed bag.  Excellent service, great view, romantic setting, some of the food and drinks taste fantastic, but the skimpy amount of food offered was astonishing and very disappointing - so much so that its a sad joke if you've come here for a meal.  If wasn't for the 6 pieces of bread I ate, I would have left hungry after dropping $150.  Much of what we were served was sparse and \"micro,\" plus severely bitter greens, which left both my mouth and my wallet feeling ripped off.  See my photos of what we ate.    Wanted to take my wife out to dinner somewhere special, so I made reservations at POV for January 17, 2015 based on Yelp recommends.  She really appreciated that I took her out to such a nice place, bless her heart.  We arrived about a half hour before sunset because I thought it would be fun for us to watch it go down - it WAS fun, great view, had our drinks served to us on the outside veranda then moved to our window table inside.  Drinks were perfect and tasty, but with tax were just shy of $28 for two small drinks.    Ambiance is impressive and classy, but no background music was heard.  Bread was presented to us almost immediately, a generous combination of focaccia and sourdough - tasted good, but wasn't warm.  The meager amount of basil dipping sauce tasted great, but they \"ran out\" of it at the point when I asked for more bread.  It seems the chef made a special effort to make more for us, and did so, which I appreciated.   But to run out of ANY key staple item like this isn't good.  Appetizers.   She had the Pear Salad ($13) - the menu clearly misleads when it says it consists of \"pears\" (she got tiny bits of pears). I kid you not, it came to her with about half a handful of some kind of green sprouty looking grass plopped on the plate.  The \"pears\" consisted of 3 nearly invisible round scoops (maybe half a teaspoon each) of pears, another teaspoon of cheese and some thin dribbles of sauce splattered on this HUGE plate.  The size of the plate literally dwarfed the so-called  \"salad\" - it was ludicrous.  I mean, I could have played a game of chess on the plate and would never have touched any part of the salad.  Sure, the wife said it tasted great, but REALLY?  Four itty bitty half-bites? The pear and cheese components could easily fit into the center ring of a teacup saucer with room to spare.    I ordered the oysters, which turned out to be 5 of the smallest (1.5 inch - maybe) oysters I have ever seen, laid out on a bed of SALT with rosemary leaves (not edible).  The oysters tasted great, but again, I'm not a midget so why serve me a micro appetizer?  ENTREES  Short ribs. For once they told the truth - these were VERY short ribs!  They were the smallest short ribs I've EVER been served - at 1\"x2.5\" - on top of a creamy rice mix that tasted just as good as I could get from a box of Rice-A-Roni.  I forced myself to eat it - it didn't taste bad, but - meh - it was oh so ordinary.  The meat tasted excellent, but really?  All that for $35?  This was billed as an entree, but you could sure fool me!  Even most appetizers have more meat than this entree..  I could have ordered a really large steak plus much more for that price at a really good restaurant.  And the butternut squash Risotto advertised in the menu as part of the meal was just the thinnest paintbrush swipe of paste...I could see the plate through it.  Not even worth putting on the menu in my opinion. Then there was a clump of limp wilted spinach-like greens between the rice and the meat.  Those greens were soooo bitter that it totally ruined my palate for the rest of the food.  When I asked our waiter if he had tasted the greens he responded by telling me that they were grown locally by some young kids who were trying to make some inroads selling food to them (thus avoiding an answer to my question).  I asked him again if he had tasted it, and he replied that he had not.  Folks, if the waiter at a place this high-end serves his guests anything he has not personally tasted, then he's not doing his job.  On my way out of the restaurant I deliberately snaked my way through some tables to see if anyone else had left those greens on their plate, and sure enough I saw some plates that had.  Hey chef!  Get a clue! (or do you even bother to check and see what your customers leave on their plates?)    My wife fared much better with two fish fillets and 4 medium prawns on a bed of rice and greens.  She said it tasted great.  I was VERY glad she was happy with her meal.  If she had voiced any displeasure, I would have sent it all back.  I won't go back.  I would have had a better meal at many other restaurants I can think of.  The view and service are nice to haves - but the food is paramount - and for what you're charging, you should be ashamed to offer so little on many of the plates we tried, and fail to ensure that EVERY ITEM on those plates tastes great and isn't misrepresented on the menu",

The tea ice cream was out of this world and the creme brulee was crazy good. This place is a must for any special occasion.",

I could do this review in three words.... \"Awesome. MUST GO\"   That being said I will attempt to give you a bit of background and reasoning. However, it's Awesome, just go!  The view is truly something to behold. From a high point get a view of downtown PX as dusk fall and evening becomes night. Make sure to make reservations for a table by the window. Then as the stars begin to shine move to the patio with your drink to view the display that is the natural beauty of our world in the night sky.   My meals and service have always been top notch.  Do not go here for a quick meal. This is a must do enjoyable evening event. Also, don't leave your wallet at home. This splendor doesn't come cheap but also not overpriced by any means.   Finish your evening with a cigar and scotch on the patio. Choose the right time of year so it is not too hot and enjoy.   And THAT.....Is my point of view.",

    "text": "This restaurant is absolutely on my top 5 for favorite fine dining in Phoenix. As I was here for a staycation during Memorial Day long weekend, I had the pleasure of dining here twice. First night was in the restaurant (upstairs) for Arizona Restaurant Week, with a 3 course dinner for $44. Second night was in the lounge (downstairs) for appetizers and cocktails.  Ambience: Although this restaurant is 30+ years, it is pretty well kept. As soon as you walk into the seating area, you are blown away by the sweeping views of Phoenix through the large floor to ceiling windows. We came around 6pm because we were told reservations are full. We are so lucky there was a cancellation and we got a seat outside on the patio! We got to see the sunset. All the other patrons seemed to be in the same romantic trance as we. On our second night, we came quite late, around 8:30pm, with plans to dine in the lounge. The lounge is open seating. As it was quite late, there were several seats open inside. But we went straight for the patio and lucked out with seats at the front. We had unobstructed views of the city night lights. Food: Most of the entrees are ~$40, which makes the AZ Restaurant Week deal very appealing. However, we weren't too hungry so we did one of the 3 course prix fixe menu and we added an entree. The portions were decent, we even had leftovers! We had the fennel braised Berkshire pork belly to start; it was excellent!!!  We had swordfish for one entree. It was absolutely delicious and memorable. The next morning, we saw the same entree featured in a local magazine! Definitely get that if you like seafood. We also got the port braised rosemary short rib with crispy risotto- DELECTABLE! Our dessert was the PB chocolate and berry. I seldom get desserts as I don't have a sweet tooth, but I was so glad I had it with the restaurant week menu.  When we got our bill, we were served 2 mini macaroons, which were very delightful way to wrap up.  The next night we went to the lounge a d had the aracini (risotto meatballs with short rib), the roasted oysters and duck confit risotto. Everything was absolutely delicious. However, since we were sitting outside and it was quite chilly out, our food cooled down a lot quicker than I would have liked. One key thing to note: the lounge has a wider range of appetizers than the restaurant. Definitely consider dining on two different occasions to maximize your experience!! Service: Lots of employees have been there for several years. Our server at the restaurant has been there for nearly 30 years. The employees snow pride in their work and naturally, the service gets a 10/10. When the sun was setting, there was practically a line of people getting photos. I thought it was very endearing any server walking by empty handed offered to help take photos for the patrons.",

    "text": "Different Pointe of View is perfect for: - Anniversaries - Business dinners - Drinks on the patio - Dinner with a view - Sunset dinner - Excellent food and great customer service - Fine dining  Tips: - Make a reservation in advance - Ask for a table by the window or get a seat on the patio - Let them know if you're celebrating a special occasion - Check online/ask if they have any special menus  For parking, follow the signs to the restaurant all the way in the back, up behind the hotel. Valet will be present to take your car. We made a reservation for a table by the window (just before sunset) and were seated immediately when we arrived. Complimentary bread was provided with a few different dips (pesto garlic, cheese, etc.). The dips were a refreshing change compared to the usual complimentary butter that is served at most restaurants.  We decided to try the Summer Prix Fixe Menu, going with the Lobster Bisque and Hydroponic Bibb & Heirloom Cucumber. The bisque tasted good, but was very heavy and creamy. It was quite a large portion, almost difficult to finish due to the richness of the cream. Perfect for dipping the complimentary bread in though. The salad was light and tasty. For the entree portion of the meal, we both ordered Grilled Marinated Bistro Steak. My friend thoroughly enjoyed it and thought it was one of the best dishes we had all week during our trip. However, I wasn't the biggest fan of the smokey black beans with manchego pairing. For dessert, we both ordered the Tahitian Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee. Smaller in size compared to the average restaurant, with a thicker layer of custard base and a thinner caramelized sugar layer. It would have been much better if the custard layer was thinner and the top sugar layer was a bit thicker (better proportion wise). Extensive wine menu on hand. We ordered a glass of prosecco and a glass of red wine, both of which were great.  Overall, a solid place for dinner with a view to celebrate a special occasion or nothing at all.",

Service was very good to start, but got progressively less attentive the longer we stayed. We wanted to order a series of their small plates, and would order when the server would come by, the problem was the server didn't come by. Didn't seem busy enough to explain the lack of service. Trying to pay was hard, my dad gave his credit card and then the bill came back as a cash transaction. Being honest, we went to the post terminal to make sure the payment was processed correctly. Will go again, but will spend less.",

We ordered the Cheese and Charcuterie Board and the Hummus of the Day with Grilled Naan and a few cocktails off of The Signature Sippers menu. The apps were delish (we ordered more Naan as it was so earthy and chewy) perfectly crafted with the basil flavored hummus. Cheese portions were skimpy but the cheese choices from the chef were winners - a smoked cheddar and tangy Brie. Fig and lemon along with some olives and salumi added that awesome piquant cheese board plus. Cocktails were awesomely done and icy cold as we watched the heat of the sun set in the Western sky. Oddly though our wait person disappeared for quite a while (spotted eating behind the bar), then later appeared and apologized for being \"busy trapped behind the bar\". When the bar wasn't busy at all. Only three tables/party's in the entire place...it was still pretty early. We're all for breaks of course but just say, \"I was on a break\" and send someone out to cover the section. Just sayin. This service mid step wasn't enough to scare us off though. Staff were otherwise pleasant and personable. All in all a great experience --and a must if one is in the Phoenix area.",

    "text": "The view is nice, but the service that we experienced, coupled with the quality of food on an off-peak night was some of the worst I've ever had. In summary, our server was extremely slow in checking in on our table, despite there only being 4-5 other tables being waited on in the entire restaurant, and whenever she had asked if she should give us a minute to think about a decision we had to implore her to stay. The food came out fast but their \"iconic\" lobster bisque tasted like liquid butter and didn't even contain pieces of lobster. The $10 lemon shrimp starter seemed nice but you only receive 3 pieces of shrimp, which is ridiculous considering the useless \"garnish-salad\" they added on to justify the price. My fiance and I have had much better food for way less money around the valley, and to be frank, I would never go back to that hotel or restaurant ever again (it's not our first time dealing with that resort, but this was definitely the last).  To top it off, our entire dinner took over 4 hours because the server was reluctant to come back to check on us. We never received spoons for the bisque, so it sat on the table for 10-15 minutes while we waited for someone to bring us a spoon. When getting dessert, after ordering it took nearly 45 minutes just to receive our tiny \"almond cake\" and Creme brulee; the cake had an overpowering artificial banana taste topped with two pieces of banana chips, and the Creme brulee wasn't even torched on the top. The thing was pale and barely had any color, so the chefs had covered the top of it completely with an assortment of berries. The taste on both was subpar, and after waiting had long we were beyond ready to leave.  Things didn't get better however because upon getting our server to return to check out, we had to wait ANOTHER 40-50 minutes to get her to take our cards and ring us out. My fiance stood up from the table and had to walk the check across the patio to go inside the restaurant and talk to someone at the bar just to drop off our cards. During this entire exchange, our waitress had several other tables under her watch and 3 of them completely cashed out while we were waiting. We couldn't have called her over either without either getting up or being rude due to the distance of the patio. At the end, we were stuck there waiting to get our cards back and we had to, once again, physically go to go the bar just to get a person to talk to us.   Regardless, the view was nice if you like looking at Sunnyslope with the sun going down, but the food was terrible and overpriced and the quality of service that we had received was laughable at best. Don't bother wasting your time coming here, it's not worth the pricing.",

They have a giant fire pit out in the back that you can sit by in the evening and sometimes they give marshmallows to roast. It's an upscale place with delicious food or if you choose not to eat you can just sit out side and have a drink and an appetizer and watch the sunset.",

    "text": "::Disclaimer #1:: This review is based on our particular service ONLY!  ::Disclaimer #2:: If you are going for restaurant week fall 2015, their online menu is not the same as the in house menu!   My husband and I went to DPOV last night to kick off restaurant week. We have both been before and knew the food would be great; and that it was. Our service however, was not. We had an older gentleman with white hair as our server who nearly ruined the experience for us. As I stated before the online menu for restaurant week is not accurate...I had chosen DPOV because it claimed to be serving duck confit (best thing I've ever ate). This was not the case and when my husband went out on a limb just to make sure we couldn't order it our server said \"not if you want restaurant week!\" okaaaay....understandable but maybe approach it diferently (ie. 'unfortuantely it's not one of the featured items OR I could do that for an extra sur-charge'). We ordered our starters and entrees, never did he ask if we enjoyed our starters but when he did ask about the main course he walked by saying \"enjoying?\" while not waiting for a resonse. Finally, once the dessert menu was delivered and we had decided he stood at our table pen in hand for about 10 seconds and said \"yes?\" At this point in time we were done...both of shook our heads and ordered wanting to get away from this guy as soon as possible. Like I said - food is, and always has been then last 3 times we've been, great! I may even go back for a glass of wine and the duck confit raviolis (because duck confit is THAT good) but I will be sure to request not to sit in this gentlemens section. All of this being said - our buss boy (a younger man, with longer, ear-length hair was great: polite, charming...I wish he could have been our server and all our tip could have gone to him.",

    "text": "Me and DH made reservations online for our anniversary dinner at this joint..all I can say is it went uphill from there!  We were greeted by the valet attendant promptly and he gave us directions to the restaurant on the 4th floor. We arrived at the lobby and were greeted by the staff, then we knew that we had to wait for a window table as all the window tables are full then, I guess she had noted that we were there for our anniversary dinner and would want to sit by the window. Then we were brought to our table after a 15min wait, to our surprise, it was a corner table and we absolutely loved the privacy of it, what a spectacular view! Shortly, we were greeted by our lovely waiter which served us a special appetizer of Lamb and roasted beetroot....lamb was not our usual fare though so I skipped it..  After I made known that I can't have any wine (I'm expecting) he offered us sparkling apple juice since we're celebrating we can't be short of any sort of bubbly! Our lovely waiter was nice and fun and gave us clear introductions of what's on the plate with every dish they serve, he used a torchlight to do that too as it was pretty dim, very educational. When we asked to have a picture taken at the table he gladly did it and even offered for after meal pictures, which he so nicely took us to the patio to take with the picturesque view!  Alright, back to the food, we had the lobster bisque for soup and it was delish! However I got pretty full by the time I got through the soup.. Next up the poached maine lobster with pancetta wrapped prawns....omg this is crustacean heaven! It was served with a delicious lemon herb risotto torte that's soooo rich but yummy! DH had the pan seared diver scallops for mains and they were very nicely done and paired with a citrusy kumquat sauce which I think balanced the richness of the scallops....they were HUGE by the way...  When we were done we asked for the dessert menu as usual but our lovely waiter told us that we can't have the menu because......ta da!!! He served us our complimentary heart shaped choc mousse cake to share for our celebration! How sweet!! (He still gave us the dessert menu as requested in the end though but we were too full to go through with it ;P)  Sorry for the long winded story of mine but because this place made our special night perfect and happy they deserved the 5 STARS I gave! MUST TRY!",

    "text": "We just moved from Florida and I was looking for a Restaurant with great food, service and a great view to celebrate my husbands 61st Birthday on Friday. It was suggested by a friend to try A Different Point of View... We are so glad we did... Let start by saying the drive up the cliffs to the restaurant was an adventure my Kia wasn't happy about but we made it.. AMAZING views... Greeted by a valet who had plenty of energy and was very informative. We picked the elevator to go to the 4th floor as opposed to the stairs... We were seated in a corner window table with views beyond belief! Greeted by our server , Larry, he wished my husband Happy Birthday and brought a passion fruit drink that was delish compliments of the Chef! Nice touch... Ask for Larry if you go.. he was right in tune with our special requests... We ordered their Signature Salad and I said we would share it... Larry had the kitchen serve it as a split.. Larry made the dinner and celebration very Special. My husband ordered the Rib Eye but my husband doesn't like any thing on his rib eye and doesn't like anything else on his plate with the meat.. Larry must hears this all the time and he explained exactly how it will be plated and assured him that no sauce or veggies would touch the meat. See pictures to see our meals. I held my breath until the plates came out and my Husband loved it- it was perfect. He ordered it medium rare and it came out perfectly cooked and full of flavor and it cut like butter. I ordered the Pork Tenderloin and it was tender and full of flavor the corn cakes were like little polenta pancakes they were delishish... The bread and the specialty butter and pesto and goat cheese dips were also full of flavor...   The dessert was a Chocolate Espresso cake also very good. The sun was setting and the lights were twinkling-- Just a wonderful experience..   I can't wait to go back when it's a little cooler to sit outside...Don't miss this wonderful casual affordable piece of Heaven!",

I felt young... but my cocktail was nice and sweet!  I had a three course meal which consisted of Appetizer- Grilled Pancetta Wrapped Shrimp  Main Course-Coffee Brown Sugar Seared Pork Tenderloin Dessert-Chocolate Hazelnut Brown Butter Brownie  Each dish was prepared brilliantly and the presentation was exquisite  I was very much in love with my main course, the Coffee Brown Sugar Pork Tenderloin  I don't drink a whole lot of coffee so I was kind of iffy in having my pork tenderloin coated with it but I was surprised  It was so good!  Also, the restaurant allows you to go out to the patio and take photos or just take in the magnificent view",

    "text": "This place is easily the BEST restaurant I have eaten at in Arizona.  The fiancee and I had come to this establishment in celebration of our Anniversary weekend.  The restaurant is perched on a mountaintop inside the mountainside resort, so you will have to drive up a bit to reach it.  However, this place is completely worth it and more.   The first thing we noticed as soon as we were seated was the view outside the restaurant.  Even though we were seated inside (outside dining area was closed due to heat temperatures), the south side of the restaurant was comprised entirely of floor-to-ceiling glass walls that gave a panoramic view of the entire Central Phoenix area.  Once we were able to take in the view enough to focus on the menu, our server immediately and consistently came to our table for any service we needed.  As we couldn't decide what we wanted to eat, we took the server's recommendation of ordering the Chef's Special which was a five-course gourmet meal with optional wine pairing with each course.  It was not until we were served this that we realized the full extent of the service that was about to be provided.  Our table was waited by not 1, but TWO full-time servers who brought out each course, explained the origin, methods and tastes of every single food item on each course.  In between courses, the restaurant chef (finding out it was our anniversary) sent over complimentary offerings (this was the first time I have ever had chocolate-covered pop rocks).  We literally felt like a wealthy couple that was being pampered and attended to in every single manner.   After the meal, we went outside with a bottle of wine and took in the jaw-dropping view of the Valley from the outside seating area.  The only downside of our visit was that this area was closed for dining as the temperatures were too hot, however that wasn't on the restaurant and hence why I am still rating this place as 5-stars.  Our servers graciously took our pictures from various views and locations, and afterwards my fiancee and I sat back on couple of the lounge chairs and took in the night skyline view with wine and relaxed.  All in all, it was the best meal I have ever had in a restaurant and easily the best service the both have us have ever experienced in a restaurant setting.  The after-meal view and drinking was so relaxing we didn't want to leave.  The only thing that may deter the average customer is the price; this was also one of the most expensive meals I have experienced, however the service and the experience is more than worth the price.  This is the best restaurant in overall ambience, food, service and views in all of AZ.  The view alone from the restaurant is enough to trump most establishments here in the Valley.  If you are looking to take your significant other on an anniversary, birthday or surprise proposal dinner, there is no better place than Different Pointe of View.",

The best time of year because we can have an amazing meal and not break the bank.   DPofV is the best choice. It has it all, ambiance, view, awesome food, the best wine list anywhere, and a wonderful staff.   1. The view is something you can only understand by seeing it. Looking out over the city, down town Phx, it's perfect. Get there in time to see it right at sundown then late int he even to see the lights. With the hot Phx air it looks like the lights are dancing.   2. The food, wow the food! We had the blue crab salad, spare rib ravioli, hanger steak and pork loin chop. All awesome! The blue crab is as good as you can get in this part of the country (far from the coast)! They were very accommodating to Jon's mushroom allergy. His hanger steak was so tasty and my pork was like butter. And brusstle sprouts, umm hello my fave!!!   3. The wine list literally is the best world. It is like 45 pages long. A bit on the excessive side for me, but I was beyond please with the Cab we picked out.   4. The staff: I think the fact that the two people we had the pleasure of meeting had both been there over 15 years speaks volumes of the place. It is obviously a great job to have, they had a great attitude, and performed perfectly.   5. Last but certainly not least, the desserts. Wow! We each ordered the Creme Brule, and somehow when dessert arrived we got \"bonus\" deserts. The chocolate turtle and their sorbet were wonderful, completely over shadowing the creme brule.   We were both in heaven when we left and almost needed to be wheeled out since we were so full! I highly recommend them for your next evening out! So good!",

The service is very old-fashioned and very doting but the menu needs a re-think.  Times have changed but this place is stuck in the 90's.  bottom line, it is an overly expensive resort restaurant with OK food and exhorbitant prices.",

Our waiter, Luis was absolutely amazing, going well above and beyond his job description to make our bight perfect.  The food was mouth watering and it was one of the best meals we have ever experienced.  The view was also breath taking.  It was a perfect evening to celebrate the beauty of our relationship.   If you want to experience something heavenly you should really give Different Pointe of View a shot. I don't think you will be disappointed!!!",

    "text": "Dined on Friday, 2/22/13. My wife and I recently moved to the Phoenix area from Chicago and I really had no idea about where to dine. It was my wife's birthday and I wanted to dine at least at a 4 star restaurant- so I came to Yelp for advice.  Our reservation was 8:15pm and we arrived at 7:55pm. We were invited to sit in the lounge area, which we did, and I expected to do so since we were so early.  We sat in the lounge for about 10 mins and were not approached by a server. In fact, I thought there were no servers since I saw none on the floor so I went to the bar and ordered myself, just like I would at a Chicago neighborhood bar. (Irk#1)Drinks were good and strong, but REALLY pricey- $26 for 2 drinks.  Around 8:30pm, we went back to the hostess desk as no one came to get us for our reservation yet, (they said they would find us in the lounge). We were told our table still wasn't ready and to wait by the fireplace. I was a little peeved now and Iwould have expected to wait if I was late- but we were sufficiently on time I thought.   We were seated after waiting another 5 mins or so. (8:45pm-30 mins late)(Irk#2) The wait staff, I thought, were pretty good overall. They did a lot of table \"hopping\", i.e. covered each other's tables, so diners were well taken care of yet not too pushy or chatty.  We both ordered the lobster bisque soup. I ordered the halibut and my wife ordered the scallops. Bread was not brought to the table until after we ordered dinner- which was 10 mins after we were seated. (irk #3) The sourdough bread was excellent. The focaccia bread was kind of bland and dry. There were 3 dipping sides offered with the bread, which were very good.   Lobster bisque was quite delicious. They put this \"hydroponically infused\" basil seasoning on top of the soup that was very good. I thought the soup was a little overcooked (sitting in the pot too long taste) but still good. My dinner arrived hot and the halibut was bland and little overcooked. (pan-fried). I asked for 2 more pieces of the sourdough bread to eat with my dinner and we were told they were \"out\" of sourdough. (irk#4). Friday night dinner service and out of bread? Really? My wife's scallops were cool as well as her vegetable sides on the plate. (irk #5)The waiter didn't check on us until 10 mins after the dinner was serves (irk#6) so it wasn't feasible to send it back to get reheated. The waiter offered us comp deserts for the trouble, at least.  The last irk (#7) was that we asked for a bag to put our left-over take home boxes in- 3 total boxes. The waiter said they \"were out of bags\". He checked twice and the 3rd time brought us a Home Depot bag. I asked if he went to his car to get it. How difficult would it have been for the restaurant manager to go down to the gift shop and grab a couple of dozen bags?   Maybe my expectations are too high since I'm from Chicago(?), but when  a restaurant is rated 5 stars by all of you Yelpers, I expect a little better service when dropping a couple of hundred bucks. Other than the view and the ambiance- I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.",

The food -for $40-$50 dish you think you will get full so of course not . The give you the meat or fish or whatever and next to it they put a little peanuts and they tell you enjoy  3.they fact that you have a good view ( we will get to the view ) doesn't mean you have to consider yourself as a fancy restaurant bc honestly it's not  To serve in big plates almost nothing doesn't make it fancy restaurant ( more like your chef watched to many ratatouille movies )  4.the service was nice can't blame them , but for some reason they had the gratuity to the bill without say anything before ( and %20 )  5. They all point of this place is the view so whoever set up this place should think how to make sure I will enjoy the view   And one more thing  If you looking to find your way up there good luck . No signs ( maybe if you really looking )  No host not a fun place",

    "text": "My wife & I came here for our anniversary with high hopes. We sat on the patio & the view was absolutely stunning-the best part of our overall experience, hands down. The server was very knowledgeable, he gave us in-depth descriptions about the items on the menu. We started with 2 bowls of lobster bisque and a salad to split. The lobster bisque was good, but not worth $12+ per bowl. The salad was brought out split, and my wife & I looked at each other in disbelief at how teeny-tiny the portion was. Definitely not worth the $12+. The tables around us got their entrees long before we did. It was awhile before they arrived. I ordered the lamb entree and my wife ordered the lobster entree. I love lamb, and this meat tasted more like pot roast than lamb. The portion was on the smaller side too. My wife's lobster was very rubbery. She only ate a few bites before passing it over to me to see if I thought it was as bad as she thought. She did not finish her portion at all, and was highly disappointed in the quality of her dish. We then ordered a slice of lemon blueberry cheese and 2 coffees for dessert. The coffees came and our waiter brought a creme brulee over to us with a little \"Happy Anniversary\" chocolate on it. We are that while waiting for our cheesecake, and eventually I asked the waiter if it was still coming. The waiter said he hadn't ordered it and therefore, it was on him. He then brought it out, and my wife & I again looked at each other in disbelief as it was a slice as long and thin as my finger. It was good, but not worth $11. The check finally came and we saw that he charged us for the anniversary creme brulee which we had not even asked for and had assumed was on the house when he brought it over to us. All in all, I had a nice time because I was with my wife and the view was beautiful, but the food was extremely disappointing and highly overpriced-we agreed the free bread & spread was the best part of the meal. The service was ok. We don't go out much as we're on a very tight budget with 2 kids, so this was a big splurge for us and we both left wishing we'd gone elsewhere.",

For starters, the steep drive to the top of the mountain is a thrill, and then upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by a cozy room and the best view of downtown Phoenix I've seen.  The staff was friendly, professional and on point.   We first ordered cocktails - two perfectly made Cosmos.  Their specialty cocktail menu was limited and a bit too funky for us, but they gladly brought us these yummy drinks.  And then there's the food.  Appetizers were to die for.  A summer salad with apricots and goat cheese, and a seared ahi tuna in possibly the best sauce ever!   Then for dinner, a glazed salmon over cheesy shrimp risotto, and pancetta pork tenderloin.    Both were delicious!!  And to top it off, a very unique serving of carrot cake and a s'mores ice cream sandwich.  We made all gone!  The perfect ending to a wonderful evening at Different Pointe of View.   This place is a perfect location for any special occasion.   We'll be back.",

Price: so for me, it's very expensive, though I know some people can ball out like that like it's nothing. 2 people with one bottle wine, we spent $175, and that's with the summer special pricing too! Very expensive. So that's why I said only special occasion for me! Lol 2/5 . Cleaniness: very clean place. Bathrooms were very clean and stocked. 5/5 .  So the server Austin (wasn't even technically our server), he was super friendly, helpful, and chill. A real nice dude and an awesome server.

The setting is absolutely stunning and perfect for a romantic date or celebration. The drive up to the restaurant winds around and around, but keep driving and you will eventually find the restaurant at the top.  The service was spectacular. We were seated right away and a wonderful table next to the window with a gorgeous view, and our meal was started with the delicious bread with three different toppings. These included a tarragon butter, a tomato pesto spread, and some sort of a lemony aioli.   I went with the prix fixe menu, which included an appetizer and entree and a dessert for $40. For my appetizer, I had the lobster bisque. This was very very flavorful (too buttery for my liking) and a smooth in texture, without any lobster chunks. My entree was better. I tried the tomato glazed steak, which was flavorful and a very generous portion. The steak was perfectly cooked to medium, and served with the delicious truffle sauce and some potatoes. The highlight of this dish for me was dessert. Creme brulee! It came with fresh berries and a small cookie, and was absolutely perfect. I would come back just for a glass of wine, a dish of creme brulee, and the gorgeous views.   Overall, this restaurant is fantastic in terms of the service setting and views (they have a lovely and large patio that is great for after dinner pictures, or for dinner itself if you can stand the heat). Great for a romantic evening out.",

The Valentine special four course dinner menu was priced at $110 per person with $50 for wine.Some of my favorite things on the menu were the pan seared scallops,lobster bisque,citrus butter poached lobster and the creme brulee.The food was good but quite frankly it was the atmosphere that was more pleasing.  With such prices i expect nothing but perfection.The service is impeccable and the staff is very courteous.I would recommend going on days when they do not have a \"prix fixe\" menu that way it's much more affordable or you could sit at the terrace room section on level 3 which also has a wonderful patio with the same view and order a few drinks and appetizers (They do not serve Mains here).  Reservations are recommended.It's really difficult to get a table here last minute.  Cheers!",

    "text": "I just got engaged here last week!  FANTASTIC views of the valley!  EXCELLENT service!  When making my reservation, I explained that I would be proposing that evening.  They made sure we had the best window table in the place.  I also had it prearranged that if I hadn't proposed at sunset, that I was going to do it between appetizers and dinner.  I have to give special thanks to our waiter, Luis, as he absolutely went above and beyond.  He made sure our dinner order didn't go in when we placed it(to insure I had plenty of time to propose outside on the patio overlooking the valley), and he even took my camera and snuck outside to take pictures of the actual proposal when I dropped to 1 knee.  The food was excellent and so was the wine selection.  It's a little on the pricey side, but worth it.  We both had the lobster bisque and the filet, and both were excellent.  I was pleased to see Cakebread wine on the list, as that is one of my favorites.  They also brought out complimentary hot cocoa from the chef, champagne to toast with, and a special dessert that had \"CONGRATULATONS!\" written in chocolate on the plate.  We spent 3 hours there, from start to finish, and we were not rushed once.  Parking was easy, since you just pull up to the front and they have valet.  There is also a full bar 1 floor below the restaurant that is spacious and classy.  The patio areas of the bar and restaurant also connect together outside, which gives the place a much more spacious feel to it.  The outdoor firepit and fountain area also a nice touch.  Overall, I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a romantic place to take your \"someone special\".  You can't beat the views, and you can even eat outside when the weather is warm enough.  Just make sure you call in a reservation well in advance to make sure you get a good window table.",

    "text": "My wife and I went here on a Monday, April 2nd for our one year anniversary.  The reviews we've read definitely made this place seem like a winner.  I made a reservation for 6:30, just shortly after the restaurant opens.  The drive up the mountain was steep but the resort is beautiful and you could just tell that the view at the top would be amazing.  Were we ever surprised!  The valet parked my car and we went inside to be seated.  Unfortunately the patio wasn't open for service but they sat us by the window so we had a great view of downtown Phoenix.  One complaint we did have about our table was that it felt like we were in the path of all the server traffic.  It was also right next to a door to the patio so a couple of people tried to come in and out but the door was locked, so that was a little distracting.    Our server, Lenny I believe was his name, was very friendly and informative.  There were so many people that came to our table giving us water refills and bread and clearing our plates.  Lenny helped me pair a wine with my dinner.  My wife ordered the duck ravioli as an appetizer and I had the lobster bisque.  The lobster bisque was phenomenal, every bit as good as the previous yelpers have proclaimed.  And the duck raviolis were excellent as well.  The ravioli was cooked perfectly, just aldente enough so that it had a nice chew, the way I like my pasta cooked.  For dinner, my wife had the lobster and prosciutto wrapped prawns.  Both were so flavorful because they were braised in butter, which adds flavor every time.  I had the scallops over a bed of rainbow cauliflower and some sauce.  The sauce was a little too citrusy  for me and the scallops were almost better without it.  There were also a couple pieces of black garlic, which I forgot was in the dish.  So when I took a bite of one not knowing what it was, that sent my mouth into shock and I immediately had to wash it down with water.  Minus that, both dishes were very good.  After dinner, we walked out onto the patio and down to the bar section to take some pictures with the city in the background.  The weather was amazing and we were so lucky to have the cityscape as our backdrop.  Dinner was a little pricey but I was glad we could share a fancy dinner on a special occasion.",

Tonight was a good example. Although it was a Tuesday and closed there were no signs telling visitors or guests the restaurant was closed to the public. If you have every been to this restaurant you would know it is a long drive up a steep hill for quite some distance. Once you get there again no sign or anything to tell you the place is reserved or closed to the public. It is only when you try to enter they tell you that you can't enter. Tonight I brought a friend who just moved to Phoenix to show them the restaurant and bar area.  I was told very rudely that I could not go in and was not able to show my friend the restaurant. I explained that I did not want to enter the restaurant or terrace area bit just show them the facility. Very disappointed in the lack of courtesy or at least a sign to show the place is reserved.

I met my friends for dinner on Friday night...there were 8 of us, but the service was extremely strange to me and there were a few mishaps that I felt need to be addressed.  While I thought it was strange that the waiter - who I am tending to believe had some weird social skills - took the order of the ladies first and then the men.  He was gracious enough to ask us if we wanted our bill split by couple.  But when he was taking our order, I knew that he also may have had ADD issues. It took forever for us to order (The waiter said he thought we were still looking because some of us had the menu open...)  My friend next to me ordered the scallops and a side of gnocchi. He asked her if she wanted to start of with a soup or salad.  When he took my order, I said the Halibut.  Did he ask me for a starter?  Nope...he said \"Wonderful...make I take your order?\" (To my friend's husband)    I wish that I did order a bowl of the lobster bisque.  I was able to try that and it was amazing.  Our entrees were delicious as well.  My friend's short rib (I also go to try) was cooked to perfection.  I heard great things about the lobster and the chicken.  My friends did tell me that the rice was a little undercooked and the gnocchi was a little heavy.  Now I wish I could tell you that my dinner was amazing.  I was enjoying the halibut with shrimp, asparagus and purple mashed potatoes.  I finished the shrimp and still had most of my halibut and mashed potatoes when I set my fork down to look at my phone.  (My fault I guess...)  Because the next thing I noticed, a server took my plate away.  There was no \"Are you finished?\" or \"Would you like to take this to go?\"  Nothing...just took my plate away.  I noticed that he stacked my plate, so there was no way to retrieve my food.  My friends were finished with their dishes....so when I said \"I am sorry, but you took my plate away and I wasn't done\", the waiter said that he was sorry and was about to go back to retrieve it.  I told him that I didn't want it now, so he did offer to have the chef make me a new one. (NO!) or if he could refill my drink.  (I was driving, so NO!) I would have thought that I would have gotten a complimentary dessert but I didn't.  I was being treated for this dinner, but still,  the dinner wasn't even comped or had a percentage taken off.   I would love to try this place again since the food and view were great.  I would just hope that my service next time would be better.",

I am from SF so to come to Phoenix and see prices higher than many of the fantastic restaurants in SF was a bit of shock.  Once I got past the $39 dollars for chicken I decided to enjoy whatever.  I started with the caprese salad.  This is a dish that is good in its simplicity, however, it was prepared with jelly that tasted like a key lime pie.  I was not thrilled by this dish.  This was all saved when the entree arrived.  I had diver scallops with lobster on a pumpkin cornbread piece with some vegetables.  I cannot explain how rich and beautifully done this was.  The scallops were the highlight.  I was a bit disappointed in the lobster(a little tough), but the flavor was just fantastic.  My husband had the ahi, which was also really well done.  It was plated with baby squash sandwiches stuffed with blue crab.  It was really great.   I want to give more stars because I did enjoy the food and the service, however, the price was not justified.  If you are going to charge starting price of $40 an entree, there have got to be little to no complaints. Great scallops though!",

The apples on the rocks and the brownie desserts were great finishers to a perfect meal. We were staying at the adjacent Hilton hotel, which offered shuttle service free to and from our room. This was a special evening which was enhanced by a perfectly, delicious meal. We are from the suburbs of Chicago, and wished we had something this special close to home.",

    "text": "Simply put, this placed sucked. My husband took me there for my birthday and we were really looking forward to it but came away SO disappointed.  First, in a restaurant full of available tables (it was nearly empty), they sat us next to the loudest table in the world.  When I politely asked if they could move us, they happily accommodated us - and moved us one table over from the loudest table in the world.  They knew it was my birthday and said nothing; we sat for 15 minutes, put in drink orders and an appetizer order (we had studied the menu at home and knew what we wanted because we were starving), and we STILL had no menues, and probably would have sat there all night waiting if I hadn't finally asked for some.  We inquired about the 5-course tasting menu, and our waiter admitted he knew nothing about it and said he had to go ask the chef.  No problem, we understand - what we DIDN'T understand was why, when he returned, he still couldn't tell us a stinkin' thing about the 5-course tasting menu - he literally named only 3 or 4 of the ingredients for a few of the courses, and then said \"Uh, I can't tell you anything more, I know know how anything is prepared.\"  When I inquired what the \"salad\" was comprised of, he he said \"some lettuce.\"  Gee, thanks for the detail.  Finally, the food was really salty!  I'd seriously give this place 0 stars if that were possible. My husband chose this place based on the mostly positive reviews but I guess we are the exception.     I will, however, say that the view was amazing and it's not as though the people were't kind because they were. But for the $, we'd have been better off just going to Mastro's.",

    "text": "What a fantastic experience!   We made our reservation with OpenTable, mentioned that it was our anniversary, and we requested a booth with a view if possible. That is exactly what we got. There are only two booths available but from what i could see there isn't a bad seat in the restaurant. We started out with a couple of cocktails and went over the extensive wine list. The captain helped us out with our menu selections, and what really impressed me was that he didn't just automatically recommend the highest priced entree. We asked to share the Lobster Bisque and they brought it out in two bowls. It was fabulous. My wife got the Pork Tenderloin, I got the Ribeye.  Not sure what varietal to pick, we asked for the sommelier, who again to our surprise, recommended a few reasonably priced Syrahs. After discussing a few of the choices we went with a 2006 T-Vine which was perfect with both entrees.  The entrees were full meals, with excellent sides. Very filling too. From the captain to the busser, the service was great. The timing was perfect throughout. During the evening, both the assistant manager and manager stopped by the table to see how we were doing.  We shared a dessert that came on a Happy Anniversary plate. Toward the end of the meal we advised the manager that we had planned on a cab ride home. He took care of getting us a cab and told us to just relax at the table until it arrived. My coffee was kept full until the cab was announced and we got home safely in a nice Escalade for a couple of dollars more than one of the discount cab services. ( that was a nice surprise too!) We will definitely come back and are happy that we found a 5 star restaurant in our neighborhood.",

The place started getting busier and our team of servers began stopping by less and less... By the time we had gotten our entrees they were pretty much nonexistent. Our food was just above Luke warm and our wine was empty.... After about 30 mins of waiting for some one to come over one of our servers came by to clear our plates. He didn't ask how our food was and didn't offer any dessert menus. We aren't really the complaining type but considering the price of the food my boyfriend got up to discuss our issues with the manager whom removed the entrees. This place really needs to improve their customer service skills. We decided to go to one of our favorite places for dessert. The  Rokerij. We won't return or recommend this place.",

First off the waitress looked completely disheveled, messy hair too small faded black shirt and cheap looking black pants. Then when we placed out order for the mussels we were advised by her that they are very fishy this time of year. My husband had never tried them so we took a chance. We also ordered the Kobe beef sliders and the tomato salad. The Kobe sliders were so well done you could call them burnt, the salad was tiny with wilted lettuce and the mussels(surprisingly) were good. By the time we saw our waitress again we were finished with our meal. I asked her about the Kobe sliders and commented that they are always prepared well done and she quickly brushed off my comment and walked off.So much for the customer is always right. Needless to say my husband and I were very disappointed to spend a hefty amount of money for so-so food and terrible service. Needless to say we will not go to Different Pointe of View again and will NOT recommend it to our family and friends.",

    "text": "I had great expectations for this restaurant as I have stayed and dined at various Point Resorts and restaurants in the valley and heard nothing but great reviews for Different Point of View. I even liked the cleverness of the name and was looking forward to a nice experience, but unfortunately I was sorely disappointed. While the view and atmosphere were very nice our service there was inexcusably poor. We ended up with a guy named Larry who was extremely inattentive, unfriendly, and all around just unprofessional. When he would finally come around he would walk away literally after two minutes WHILE we were still speaking. He was curt and abrupt in his responses and almost hit me with a knife when he dropped the silverware and did not even excuse himself or apologize. Unfortunately his brusque, rude behavior was not merely limited to our table. However, the hostesses, bussers and other waiters around us were all great, so much so we were tempted to move to another table. Maybe he was having a bad night, but for this type of establishment and for the amount of money you're laying out you would expect half-way decent service. The food was hit and miss. The Kobe short ribs were great- flavorful and tender- the tangyness of the balsamic reduction was a nice foil against the mild sweetness of the perfectly creamy polenta. Consequently, we had great expectations for our entrees- if the service was bad at least our food would be good, but alas to our dismay again we were somewhat disappointed. The central elements of our meals, the steak and halibut, were both flavorless and overdone though the supporting casts of sauces and sides were very flavorful and well prepared. The shrimp with the lemon fennel reduction was fabulous, but it could not mask the dryness and lack of flavor in the halibut. The steak was tough and flavorless and when sent back returned somewhat less tough, but still flavorless. Definitely not at all in the caliber of a Ruth's Chris, JnG, or even Fleming's or the Keg. The creme brulee was nice though nothing outstanding and the chocolate amandine had a flat pre-packaged taste- after a few bites we left the remainder. There are too many other great restaurants in Phoenix with fantastic views and ambience to waste this type of money on poor service and mediocre food.",

On Saturday we finally made it, and I wish that we hadn't waited as long as we did.  This restaurant was fantastic, and far exceeded my expectations.  I am always skeptical of restaurants in this price point, especially when you assume that you may be just \"paying for the view\".  Not True at all.  The food at Different Pointe of View can stand up to the creativity and quality of any other high end restaurant in town.  I had the Port Cabernet Braised Kobe Short Rib: Fresh Sweet Corn Polenta, Chanterelle Mushrooms, Endamame & Blue Berry Balsamic Reduction as an appetizer.  It was delicious and unique, and my only complaint was that there was not more of it.  My wife had the lobster bisque with Heirloom Cauliflower & Lobster Timbale, it too was remarkable, but I was glad that I got the short rib.  For entrees I had the Cedar River Prime New York Strip: Pancetta Chervil Rosti Potato, Braised Artichoke Heart & Portabellas Sherry Caramelized Onion Reduction.  There was a lot going on in this dish, and I appreciated every bit of it.  The steak was perfect and the carmelized onion reduction was incredible.  My wife had the Palo Verde Farms Pork Tenderloin with Chorizo Stuffing: Piquillo Pepper Parmesan Risotto, Sweet Corn & Baby Zucchini Succotash, Caramelized Tree Ripened Peach & White Balsamic Olive Oil Emulsion.  This had a ton of flavor and she loved it.  The risotto was really my favorite part of the dish, but the pork was excellent.  We both had some standard desserts - i had creme brulee which was good, but nothing special, and she had the Chocolate Amandine: Milk Chocolate Mousse and Vanilla Amaretto Cream, which I wish that I had gotten.  We did not sit on the patio, but I cannot imagine a more beautiful place to eat, and I will certainly reserve my table well in advance on our next trip to make sure that we sit outside.  This place will not disappoint, and it is definitely NOT just about the view.",

It's a little thick but still good)   * Entrees - Grilled Filet Mignon - Maine Lobster (scallops are to die for) - Pork Tenderloin  The complimentary bread with PESTO sauce is the best.

My fiance ordered the prime filet, which he said was phenomenal. I ordered the scallop and lobster dish as my main course. It was absolutely amazing. We shared a creme brulee for dessert, which was pretty good as well.  The prices are, I think, very reasonable considering the level of dining and the experience. They are extremely gluten-free friendly as well, even offering to bring out veggies to substitute the bread at the table.  I would highly recommend DPOV to anyone, whether a visitor or a native.

    "text": "2 words for this place: the views. The view are absolutely amazing. If you are looking for a romantic restaurant with some of the best views of Phoenix, then I really don't think that you can beat this spot. Our party of four all ordered the pre fix 5-course tasting menu at $89 per person. The dishes included a shrimp, scallop, sea bass, duck, and dessert course. I will say that the majority of dishes were very pleasing with my favorite course being the scallop course. I was surprised to find out how large each course was as well. Typically if you do a tasting menu the courses are just a few bites, but these courses were super generous. With this being said, if you don't have that big of an appetite that day then I would not recommend the tasting menu because it was very filling, especially because they offer complimentary bread as well. Make sure to get a window seat, it will definitely enhance the experience. The servers and the hostess were great. A had a few small issues with a couple of the courses which is why I can't give them the full 5 stars but nonetheless it was a really great experience and the views alone were enough to visit this place.",

It all the way at the top, highest mountain, and that's where the good view comes from. It was my sisters birthday and decided to go somewhere of a more \"fancy dining\" kind of feel. My family and I are Latinos ok, as soon as we got to the place we were getting eye rolls from every direction. Pretty sure we were the only Latinos in that whole restaurant and for some strange reason nobody was fond of that. Our waiter sat us down and immediately was very short and not welcoming at all. Our food took 2 hours long!!!! And I know that's stuff that the \"kitchen\" is responsible for but our waiter didn't make it any better, he never came to check up on us or ask if we were doing ok, or needed anything?! 2 hours to get your food is just unacceptable!!!!! I hate this place ruined our whole trip!!!! They were so rude!!!! I was embarrassed with my family that I took them here... never again! We traveled from Vegas, we know what fine dining is!!!!!! This is NO FINE DINING RESTAURANT!!!!!!! And you sense racism the moment you walk in!!!!!!!! Ian was the waiters name.",

Dip in the bread and enjoy! I also had the lobster and scallops which I hate to admit, I could not eat it all....  Also at the table, we had the pork chops and the chicken and for appetizers we also had one of the salads and the pork belly.  All unbelievably good...  The place is 4 diamonds over and over and can be pricey, but worth every penny.  Go here and enjoy it. There is not a bad thing on the menu and the location is beautiful.   Nash was our waiter.  He was on spot.  Attention to detail and knowledge of the wine cellar, as well as the menu made him a brilliant conveyance of the meal.  Thank you, Nash.  We did get to meet the chef.... and he cooks every night.  On the line.  Perfect dishes.    Why this place works... longevity.  People work there for decades. They are professionals - all of them.  Each one knows their role and support each other.  Customer service and food service is a skill that this team has established.  If you need to entertain or have a peaceful, well prepared and hosted dinner - go here.",

Beware that they have 2 levels, so if you are going to an all you can eat, being seated on the lower level would be very inconvenient, imagine stairs and plate of food in your hands, so don't wear high heels and long dresses. There is an elevator, however, do you really wanna wait every single time you get up to get food?!?!? My very first thought when they sat us down on a lower level was \" if I have to walk that stairs every time I need food, I'd rather have a bowl of pho and call it a day\".  They moved us, but for $650, we could have eaten better. The view during the day is nothing spectacular, rocks, mountain, cactus, if you wanna see this, go hiking. However, I'm going to give this place another try at dinner, hopefully food is better at dinner time.",

Unlike Cafe Monarch the Tapitio Cliffs offers the best view in the valley and both have excellent cuisine. We opted for the \"Chefs tasting menu\" a complete five course dinner for $89.00 per person with they offer a wine pairing option for an additional $39.00 the 1st course was a braised pork belly over root vegetables delicious. The 2nd course was a seared Diver Scallop with a pesto sauce a butter lettuce salad with citrus dressing amazing. Next we were served seared center cut swordfish with quinoa with charred vegetables and a pomegranate beurre blanc.The 4th course or main was filet mignon over crimini mushroom risotto which  was superb. Last a banana anniversary torte to top off this 5 star meal. The Different Point of View has won many dining awards and they are well deserved enjoy the pictures.",

    "text": "IN SHORT: Anthony DeMuro crafts an elegant menu on top of one of the best views in Phoenix. Reservations are key for that special occasion, but the palette of flavor developed throughout the meal will surprise you at every bite.  THE STORY: Different Pointe of View is one of the finest pieces of culture in Phoenix. Nearly every table can enjoy miles of city and mountain views that lend an understanding to the city's form so rarely found.  The wonder doesn't stop at the atmosphere, however, as the food and and drink never stop wowing. The salad options change seasonally, but be sure to include one in your meal as an appetizer or small second course. During my most recent visit, I enjoyed the phenomenal Poached Pear and Micro Herbs salad, which included a cinnamon-cider poached pear, dried goji berries, Humboldt Fog cheese, toasted pistachios, and a d'anjou pear and tarragon dressing. Presentation is one of Chef DeMuro's greatest talents, and each ingredient truly shines as it arrives on your plate. The Blueberry and Rocket Arugula salad was also a favorite, with dried blueberries, goat cheese, Marcona almonds, shaved beets, and a sweet cabernet lavender vinaigrette that was astonishingly light, floral, and fresh.  For my entree, I ordered the Vanilla Brandy Poached Maine Lobster, which came beautifully served against 3 lobster and parmesan raviolis, expertly cooked with the perfect bite. The smokey lobster buerre blanc sauce added another hearty, yet southwestern element that finished off the dish.  Of course, service is impeccable, and our waiter and sommelier truly acted as if they were happy to be serving us. We were tended to often, and frequently asked about each course. Needless to say, Different Pointe of View is just perfect for a rare, relaxing, beautiful, and immensely satisfying meal in the heart of Arizona.",

The views were breathtaking and the wait staff was kind and helpful. She got the lobster bisque and the scallops. Lobster bisque was the worst we've ever had with no chunks of lobster. Her scallops were WAY too salty (and we like our salt) and her corn and herb quinoa were overly seasoned and fragrant. I got the pork belly and the duck breast. The pork belly was amazing - strongly seasoned but still tasty. I've had duck twice before and they were both far better than this. We ordered potatoes and mushrooms for our sides but both were forgotten when the entrees arrived. Dessert was on the house for this error and it did not disappoint; however, we'd rather have stellar entrees and no dessert than what we experienced here.  Bottom line: perfect for a great photo op but go somewhere else for a great meal.",

We wanted to come here a couple of years back but didn't get a chance to due to scheduling so we were pretty excited about finally being able to come here for dinner!  If you're staying at the hotel by the way, no, you can't walk it, especially if you are in heels.  Don't even try.  It's not worth it.  The hotel has a service where they will drive you up there ... I'm pretty sure it's complimentary but check with the hotel.  So we get in and nobody to greet us.  I was disappointed and a little confused b'c for a minute there, we had no idea what was going on.  When the hostess finally showed up, however, we were welcomed and seated promptly.    Our waiter (Bob I think was his name) was exceptional.  He told us about the evening special and was very attentive throughout the entire evening.  My husband and I aren't really fancy people so coming to places like this kind of intimidate us but he was very personable and I'm pretty sure he knew we didn't \"fit in\" with the crowd there.  The view is awesome.  WOW.  We really enjoyed having a view of the city in front of us as we dined.  I had the lobster and the husband had the duck.  Both of our meals were delectable.  We also shared a side dish of risotto which was also very savory and delicious.  The lobster tasted fresh and succulent.   I was very surprised considering we live in Phoenix!  No dousing of the lobster in butter to make it tasteful - it was perfect just the way it was (as it should be!).    We also shared a dessert ... I can't remember the name but it was chocolate peanut butter something-a-ruther with Snicker's ice cream I think?  Anyway, that was good, too.    This place definitely ain't cheap but for the experience, it was well worth coming here.  We'd definitely come here again in the future if the occasion arises!",

The best appetizer is the duck confit raviolis. For an entire, I ordered the filet, which was cooked to perfection. He ordered the short ribs. The flavors were amazing. Both meats melted in our mouths. For dessert - bread pudding all the way. And not only was the view breathtaking and the menu outstanding, the service was some of the best I ever experienced. I never had to look for my waiter. My water glass was always full. And the staff offered to take photos of us several times in different settings.

With DPoV participating once again in AZ Restaurant Week, and a dining partner who wanted to take advantage of it, it was finally off to DPoV we went.  Before we went, I didn't understand the plethora of \"4 stars\" that this fancy restaurant constantly receive.  But having gone, now I totally get it.  It's a great restaurant, but it's lacking that little something to make it stand out.  The Food: -our 3 course prix fixe was delicious, from the lobster bisque topped with crunchy veggie bits to the filet mignon perfectly cooked to the chocolate heaven dessert, my mouth was always satisfied.  However, it lacked that one abso-freaking-lutely amazing dish that deserves a 5 star.  The Ambience:  -the view was amazing, and that does deserve the coveted 5 stars :-)  The Service: -hailing from normal restaurants of being served by 20 somethings rushing around, the silent and smooth service performed by pudgy older men was a welcome change, and added much to the atmosphere.  However, they could have coordinated a little better.  Ex: 3 different waiters came to make certain we received dessert forks.... thanks, we did.  So would I go again?  Definitely, but not until I've exhausted the list of other 4 diamond (AAA  rating) restaurants in the city.",

    "text": "5 star location and view.  1 star service.  2 star food quality.  1 star atmosphere.  Outside of the outstanding view and patio, I'm having a hard time finding much positive to say about this place.  Service sucked. For a restaurant in this price range I'd give it negative 3 stars. Waiter was extremely inattentive. We ended up getting more (& better) service from a different waiter. Not really sure what our waiter was doing all night since we dined late and the restaurant was nearly empty. Our original waiter waited 30 to 45 minutes after we ordered to let us know that the kitchen was out of some items we ordered. This is 100% inexcusable for a restaurant in this price range.  Food flavor ranged from bland to unimpressively odd. The preparation of individual items and dish combinations were overreaching, unappetizing and spectacularly disappointing.  Desserts where completely underwhelming and generic in options and taste.  To add insult to injury, we were seated right next to a drunk party of 6 (the restaurant was nearly empty) who spent the entire night obnoxiously yelling over each other, constantly using vulgar language.  It was extremely difficult to hear the person directly across the table from me speak. Again, for a restaurant in this price range, this is 100% unacceptable.  I'd be hard pressed to return to this restaurant even if it had TGIFriday's prices.  Considering the prices, I prefer to give this place negative 2 stars. I'll have to settle for 1.  If you want to enjoy the view, simply stop by for drinks.  If you want a great meal and service, save your money for someplace like BLT or Rancho Pinot.",

We each had a salad, the arugula apple was better than the endive (too salty - I am all for bacon but it could have been incorporated more tactfully).  Her scallop entree was very good.  My sea bass was just not flavorful.  Cooked correctly, I enjoyed the accompaniments, but it just didn't knick my socks off. Bread pudding dessert was great , but not memorable. The service was attentive, but for lack of a better word unskilled. The waiter didn't know the tasting menu, or specials, and read them hesitantly from a rough folded up printout from his pocket. He didn't have anything at all substantial to say about any items except that some are popular.  I wish I had thought to reserve outside seating, which is really the star.

Everything was special and delicious, just as one would hope for a celebratory occasion. A welcome surprise was the service provided by Luis. He gave the right amount of suggestions for courses, wine and timing - all with a sense of humor one would not expect from such a fine restaurant. (At one point, he compared himself to Cesar Milan.) We shared the Short Ribs Ravioli and Steamed Cedar Creek Clams as 2 courses, at Luis's suggestion. It felt so European! My husband savored the Coffee Brown Sugar Seared Pork Tenderloin, while I especially enjoyed Luis's suggestion of Grilled Cedar River Marinated Hanger Steak. The both proteins were some of the most tender I've ever tasted. The hanger steak was a thin serving and the perfect portion. To end, we chose a Midnight Espresso Cup, but Luis also brought us the creme brulee, too. As he said, \"You can't come to the Pointe and miss out on the creme brulee.\" He was SO right. I hate dessert and it made me never want to say no to a dessert again. One thing to remember is to prepare for a long service. Food like this is worth it. My one complaint: the clam broth was underseasoned. Seems like small potatoes to me.",

Logistically, we were a pain in the ass. Five diners, one table. Between one and three courses ordered per person. NOT an easy job to pace that one! Mom had the lobster bisque and lobster entree. One cousin had the lobster bisque, a salad, and the special oyster app. Other cousin had a salad and scallop entree. Mom's husband just ordered the scallop entree. And I had the blood orange salad and Berkshire pork belly app. Service was impressive...plates were staggered in a way that it seemed we always had food in front of us, but never felt rushed. All the food was fresh and tasty, and beautifully presented.  Personally, I am thrilled with how many places pork belly is showing up these days. My hips are not happy, but my taste buds talk louder! :) Of course - the sun goes down, the Valley lights come on - and you remember why you're willing to pay insane prices. No matter how good the food is, no matter how good the service - you are paying for the view. And it is worth it! (That's not the double Maker's on the rocks talking!)",

Food was excellent, and I wish I could remember the name of the wine we had! I started with a Brussels salad (note to self: you still don't like Brussels, no matter how much they \"dress\" them up!) salad was not bad, mind you, just not my cup of tea! Hubby had a butter lettuce salad with lardons and sharp Oregon cheddar...super yummy!  Being the carnivores we are, we both completely enjoyed our filet mignon, served with baby carrots and fingerling potatoes. Heavenly! My meat was the perfect rare (still mooing...ha!). The serving sizes were perfect.   We rounded out the meal with two desserts, creme brulee for me and some sort of chocolate flourless thing for my husband. Both were good, because dessert is never bad! But, not the highlight of the meal. Best creme brulee goes to Donovan's, amazing!

    "text": "Great view, but disappointing food and service.  Everything was overdressed, EXTREMELY salty and lacked a \"fresh\" quality. The service was poor, and our fast-talking server was almost impossible to follow. I asked a question and ended up more confused after his answer.  The braised artichokes were extremely over-dressed, or over-marinated, and overcooked to the point they were pretty mushy. The salad was salty and overdressed, also mushy. The salad is called an heirloom tomato salad, but the paper thin slices are nearly tasteless (except for the salty dressing sprinkled over). The rest of the salad consisted of some soggy greens, feta bits, chopped olives and some mushy marinated peppers (i think).   It was fun to try something new, but we won't be returning.",

My husband promised him a hundred dollar tip if he would get us a window table, but the server kept reminding even our guests to make sure that my husband provided that hundred dollar tip at the end of the evening. This was a very rude act from the server and he should of never pressured the customer into giving him $100 tip as promised.  He would've got that tip if he would've stop badgering my husband about it from the very beginning. It was very uncomfortable and it made us want to leave. Keep in mind he did this 3 times the first time he did it to our guess, then he told his co workers about this tip and finally he came came his self to collect. My husband was prepared to give him the tip under the table, but his but his pushiness became very uncomfortable as he came over when we were enjoying our drinks to ask for it and we were not even done with our night. We will think twice before we come back to this restaurant not because of the food but because of service.",

We got to meet Chef Anthony and he even made a special surprise appetizer for us a few times. I brought my wife here for our first date, proposed to her here, and we even got married on the balcony outside. Dining in Phoenix doesn't get better than this. To me, it's the Ritz Carlton of restaurants",

    "text": "This restaurant is 5 stars for the view alone (which is what everyone else has mentioned), but the food and service are excellent too. The other night my girlfriend and I went back for the first time since the amazing Yelp event earlier in the year. We started the night off with a drink at sunset on the outdoor patio, overlooking most of Phoenix. Then we headed inside for our dinner and the manager greeted us with a \"Thank you for coming back to Different Pointe of View,\" which I thought was a nice touch. I assume he knew we were returning since I mentioned we had a card for a free bottle of sparkling wine when I made the reservations weeks before.   We were seated inside near the window and our waiter was very friendly and attentive. Our bottle of Champagne was presented to us to start the night and we placed our food orders. We decided to split the Braised Duck Ravioli ($12) and the Pan Seared Diver Scallops ($15). There were two raviolis and two scallops per order and we felt both dishes great choices. The scallops were some of the best I have ever had.   For our main course we each ordered the Grilled Cedar River Filet Mignon ($38). The perfectly prepared tenderloin steak was accompanied with horseradish crust, Swiss chard, roasted fingerling potatoes, smoked apple wood bacon, chives, Creme Fraiche and port wine pomegranate reduction. No I didn't memorize all of that, of course I retyped it from the menu.  For dessert we split the Classic Tahitian Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee (all desserts $9). It was delicious, but rather small and didn't quite satisfy my sweet tooth. The buttercream blue cheese cookie and fresh strawberries were a nice addition, but even with those it was too small a dish.   Overall, I 100% recommend you stop in and have dinner and drinks at Different Pointe of View. It has been one of my favorite Phoenix restaurants for many years. It's a perfect place for locals and out of town visitors alike. My only recommendations for improvements would be to add a server or two to the outside patio bar area since it tends to be slow on busy evenings. Also, I think the names for some of their dishes are a bit much and could be shortened.",

I recommend showing up right at 6 to get a table by the glass wall right beside the mountains- they fill up very fast. There is also seating outside, but it may be too hot to sit there during the summer months. We showed up around 630 and we're able to see the whole sunset, and then took our bottle of wine outside to sit on the patio after dinner with the beautiful view in front of us.

Everything about the dinner... the view, the interior, the food's taste and presentation was outstanding, but what really made the experience memorable was the personal attention given to us by Luis, our server. In particular, one of my daughters is finicky about what she'll try and Luis assured her and explained each dish in detail, relating it to other things she might have tried and enjoyed in the past. (She loved the attention.) He was patient, informative, pleasant... everything you could possibly want your server to be in an upscale restaurant and much more.  If you're reading this Luis, thank you for making such a memorable experience for us! :-)  Tip: The view from this restaurant is probably the best in Phoenix - I'm surprised the place isn't packed 24/7 just for the view. That said, I recommend either arriving early or remaining late (with a warm coat for sitting beside the fire pit outside,) so you can absorb the wonderful world view set far below and into the distance.  Enjoy. :-)",

Good start with the bread basket and there different kinds of sauce/butter. Then off to our shared appertizer - Hamachi Crudo, aka yellowtail sashimi. Well, I had to mark off a star by paying $14 for a plate of fish that's almost equivalent to one piece of sashimi in a normal sushi restaurant, maybe I should compliment great knife work to the chef? And no, you did not use blood orange as described on the menu, the color is too light to say 'blood'.   Pan Seared Barramundi - pleasant presentation and tasty fish, but the bed of olives and toasted farro with feta cheese, hmmm, very sour and too salty for me, and maybe too many drizzels of olive oil? Also, it seems like they really like this garlic crisp, saw it twice on three different dishes! And decent 3.5 stars to the short ribs! It's good but not impressed.  I don't think I've ever said no to a dessert, in fact, how can you fail a dessert? Well, I was proven wrong that you can mess up a dessert, very badly. We took the waiter's suggestion and took his favorite chiffon cake (no offense to our waiter), but this cake had the strangest taste, the middle part is a saffron flavored ice cream? I had to admit I just tasted Indian or persian on my cake, not to mention that the edge of the cake looked like it was bitten off by a mouse, why so uneven? all three of us had a bite and all had the same reaction - please take it away...  Overall, the high expectations of good food due to such beautiful view did not work for us, and be careful with the dessert!",

Thankfully they had their terrace room open and enjoyed the crisp air, views, some wine and Kobe sliders while we watched the sunset...delicious!! This is definitely not some place we can afford to eat all the time and being the youngest couple there I'm so happy they really went out of there way to make our night just as memorable. Every single staff member checked on us, made us feel welcomed, joked and laughed with us and we got so many \"happy anniversary\" wishes, just super great. They serve food you normally see in movies or on cooking shows, super fancy so I was praying that everything would be good and enough to eat. I loved it because we were able to have two appetizers, two entrees, and two desserts plus 3glasses of wine (about $180 total for what we got) and we were so full after, it was great to be able to try a bit of everything unlike most restaurants where you can't even stomach dessert after your meal.  All in all customer service was on point and the views were truly amazing, I didn't want to leave. It is a beautiful romantic spot and we will definitely be returning, hopefully asap!",

He was knowledgeable about wines as well as everything on the menu including the special of the day. One of the reasons I picked this place is because they have several gluten free items from which to choose. First, we had what I consider the best table in the place, right at the far southwest corner. Perfect view, wish we could have come at sunset, surely it would have been spectacular. We started off with red wine and pork belly for the appetizer. What I will share is that we thought we only ordered one, to share, but they brought us two, no worries, we enjoyed them. Then we had salads. My friend ordered the steak and I got the chicken, so we could try each others. Both were just fabulous. I was way too full for dessert but my friend made room for creme brulee which was very tasty. The entire meal was nicely done and enjoyable. The meal was not inexpensive, but you kind of know that going in, ours with tip was just over $200.",

    "text": "Just moving back to the valley after 10 years & not knowing where to go for that special occasion I went to my trusted go to site Trip Advisor to find that place. I stumbled upon Different Pointe of View at TapatIo Cliffs & we read through some of the reviews searched a couple of other places but we kept coming back to Different Pointe of View. The view is way better then the pictures show was truly amazing. We were greeted with a smile & seated at a window table ( but honestly I think any table has a great view). We watched the storms roll in was breathtaking with the lights over the city.  The service was amazing & friendly not stuffy & was fun but Nash, Ryan & Tunda made our special night even more special we Thank you all!   The food was amazing from a fresh Hummus to goat cheese olive oil spread to the Seafood with a melt in your mouth broth to Pork Cooked just right it is very fresh and the mix of flavors in every dish is an experience not to be missed. Desserts you have not lived until you try the Creme brulee you need to come here it was the best we have ever had ( I enjoyed my birthday candle & sign added made my night) or the chocolate peanut butter mousse with the ice cream yum. No need to find another restaurant you need to make this your only go to for any meal, truly amazing.   Different Pointe of View is truly The Best in the Valley for Atmosphere, View, Staff & The Food.",

We came during restaurant week and usually I dont like to leave a review based on restaurant week because it's usually not the best week to try a new place. The lobster bisque was wonderful and my swordfish was okay but not spectacular. For dessert we had a cheesecake and a creme brulee. Food was good but not memorable. Ambience wAs wonderful!",

Service was great.  Timing for each course was perfect.    Portion size is True to fine dining establishment.  You can share dishes, but the dishes are portioned for one person.  For example, salads and desserts dishes are portioned for one, and not to be shared.  My salad was delicious.  The rest of the table enjoyed filet mignon, lamb and a delicious shrimp pasta.  Overall, if you are looking for a fine dining establishment with a view, simple fine dining menu (not a lot of options) and a great wine/drink menu, come and check them out.  They are worth it.    If you are into ending your dinner with a Digestive, then order the Leila.  Its a fusion of carob and herbs.  It's delicious and your tummy will thank you.    .",

You can really see that it IS a valley from there ;).  The service was outstanding.  I had the Salad, Short ribs and Chocolate something for desert.  ALL of it was as spectacular as the view.  For restaurant week, you get 3 courses for $44 per person. Restaurant week starts on May 17, and many restaurants participate - WELL WORTH it for this gem.  The only thing is, the drive up the hill was a little scary - luckily my husband drove.  Use the valet parking.  I'm definitely going again.",

We didn't have dinner there however we came for the view and had a few drinks which made for a perfect night. We arrived around 7pm so we could watch the sunset over the Phoenix skyline which was absolutely beautiful. What topped it off is I even got to watch a wedding proposal happen right in front of me! Hats off to that guy, what a beautiful setting for a proposal!  My friends and I shared a bottle of wine which I felt was appropriately priced for the quality we got! I also ordered a starter on the \"lounge\" menu which was deep fried risotto with pulled pork... you will not be disappointed! The staff overall was so accommodating and friendly which is something I can always appreciate being that I used to work in the restaurant industry.   Although I cannot attest to the food served at dinner, I highly recommend coming here just for the view alone. One thing to note, it is a very steep drive driving up to the restaurant so plan accordingly to that! This restaurant is honestly an Arizona gem and I cannot wait to take more people here very soon!",

Everything we ordered looked and tasted amazing.    It was a girls night and we went right before the sunset and it was an amazing view of the city.  Next to hiking this has probably one of the best views of the city I have seen in a while.   While the prices are a little on the expensive side it is worth spoiling yourself occasionally, so it was worth it.   I have read that most people are not a fan of the lobster bisque and it was good but I could see if you ate the entire bowl it can be bit overwhelming because it is super rich and creamy.  We actually bought one for the table and shared it with 4 people.  I liked the bisque but that was only after taking a few sips before the rich creaminess overpowered the soup.   If you can, you definitely should try and dine outside to truly enjoy the view.",

    "text": "A pretty typical upscale restaurant.  General logistics: Parking is easy to find. Once you are at the base of the hotel, just follow the signs for DPOV (expect quite the climb to the top). Self park and valet options available when we arrived at 5pm. After you park, approach the building, take the elevator to the 4th floor and the hostess will be there to greet you. Typical spendings range from $50-100 per person including tax/tips. Reservations are recommended.  Service: 3/5 Our hostess and waiter were good, but underwhelming compared to that of other upscale restaurants. We were one of the first to arrive and with a reservation. With plenty of open seating, we were seated behind a pillar that obstructed our view. Upon our request, our hostess (somewhat reluctantly) switched us to the next table. Our waiter served what we ordered, but less attentive and did charge us an extra entree by mistake (honest mistake that was resolved when I inquired about the extra cost). The point is... while we got things at our request, we HAD to ask.  Sounds snobby, but if a 20% tip of the bill approaches $40 for a two people dinner, I was hoping for more observant/proactive services. Again, service was fine, just subpar for the occasion.  Food: 4/5 We ordered an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert. The complementary bread would be better if warmed and soft. The first bite of our duck on risotto appetizer was very tasty, but increasingly greasier with each subsequent bite. Our lobster entree was cooked with a texture that perfectly balanced between spongy and melt-in-mouth, which went really well with the crawfish ravioli. The short rib was tender and succulent with seared crispy surfaces, which went well with the complementary bread. Our chocolate mousse dessert was too sweet even with the acidity of its berries to pair.  Ambience: 3.5/5 The draw of this restaurant is the view. Personally, the views are pretty bland in Phoenix as there are no defining landmarks (i.e. no skylines or oceans). However, the sunset in Phoenix is spectacular like a flame that blazes through the desert sky.  We came specifically at the time of sunset, but unfortunately came on a day where the outside patio seating was reserved for a birthday party. Still a pleasant indoor window view, but didn't get to take in the full sunset.  Overall: 3.5/5... rounded to 4 stars. DPOV met my expectation, but didn't exceed it. The food is solid, but the overall experience fell a bit short for its price range.",

It was a special occasion for us, as neither would normally have room for this kind of experience in the budget.  The view is incredible and the recipes and presentation are really great.  She had the swordfish, I had the lamb shank. After we left, she started to feel less than stellar, and before morning, it was clear that she had food poisoning, but I'll spare the details.  These things happen, but it was made worse that it happened to her after she paid for this expensive meal for both of us. Adding insult to injury, when I called to talk to a manager, none was available.  I left a message with the host, leaving multiple points of contact, but by the end of their business day, no one had bothered to return the call.  I called again, this time leaving a voice mail.  It has now been 4 days and it's clear I won't be getting so much as a call back.  I'm very disappointed.  We're two restaurant industry vets and expected better",

I went with the swordfish over the filet, which I think was a great choice. I tried their filet, and it was good, but a filet is a filet; it better be cooked good. Now for the swordfish it had tons of flavor, but I think the sea bass took the cake. That had very unique flavors and spices. It was too Notch. They had multiple sauces for the bread, which added a certain touch.   As for Ambience, this place was impeccable. Great background music. Views were awesome. The staff was top notch across the board. It was a taste of the old school high class service.   Dessert was excellent. The drive up the mountain is pretty entertaining. Great bar area on the first floor where you could relax and enjoy a beverage before or after dinner.",

The waiter offered him the 3 course special and automatically assumed that my husband wanted the same. He never explained the 3 course special to him. It would have been nice if he had explained it to all of us. It felt like the waiter was stressed and tried to hurry everything.  My husband had the pork, which he thought was a little dry, I had the Sea bass which was excellent. The dessert was nothing special, although the presentation was beautiful.

It is extremely rich, to the point of being inedible (which at $11 a bowl is a shame). The lobster flavor is strong but also adds a sweetness that was a little much. I took a few bites and the rest sat there until taken away.   Our waiter was sub-par, we saw him once to take our order, and did not see him again (even when our food was brought to the table) but the gentleman floating around did fill our glasses, bring us fresh bread, and check in on us, which had me wishing he was our waiter instead.   Finally, the shining light on this experience was the chicken dish with butternut squash with pepper, and roasted Brussels sprouts. It made it to the top 5 best dishes I have ever eaten. Everything was absolutely perfect, from presentation to flavor.",

    "text": "\"How's your Steak Tartare, Sir? Would you like to order something different?\"  Said the waiter, at what was formerly known as Etienne's Different Pointe of View.  We were in our late teens then.   And by our waiter's questioning, he was quite sure that these runts were unfamiliar with French cuisine, carefully prepared by the legendary Chef Etienne.  I politely responded to him that it was as good, or even better than the Steak Tartare that I had when I was in Paris. \"My compliments to the Chef!\" I exclaimed.  It's been that long since we've dined at this establishment. And although the structure shows signs of aging, the passage of time hasn't quelled my Gasps in Awe as to the beauteous view of the surrounding valley from the elevated location where the restaurant resides. Nor has time diminished the beauty of my Beloved wife, whose company never gets old.  Different Pointe of View is legendary in the Valley, not simply because of its magnificent views, but also because of the remarkable dining experience from the carefully prepared Entrees and Main courses; as well as, the friendly and efficient wait staff.  From the moment that we crested the hill as we ascended towards the restaurant, our Valet was right there -eagerly, and promptly, opening the Passenger door to assist my wife.   We were early for our reservation; therefore, our Hostess directed us to the Lounge so that we could avail ourselves of some appetizers, and take in the intoxicating view of the lighted landscape, below.  It wasn't too long before we were ushered into the dining room. Surprisingly, we were seated at approximately the same location when we last dined which seemed like eons ago.  Ian, our waiter, was simply so friendly and cordial.   His manner was warm and inviting. His customary introduction to that particular evening's offerings provided both the particulars, and the superlatives of each dish.  I opted for Chef's special, which was the Braised Short Rib. And my Beloved ordered the Bistro Steak. Both were absolutely sublime. Delicately prepared, overflowing with flavor, and the presentation was exquisite - even in the \"romantically\" lit atmosphere.   We did order an appetizer, which was the Chef's Cheese and Charcuterie Board. It was a great combination of meats and cheeses that is meant to whet one's palate, without overly satisfying our appetite for this evening's main courses.  And for the finale, we had the Chocolate & Peanut Butter dessert. They dub it \"The Best Thing Ever\"  As amazing as this dessert is, I have to politely disagree. I married The Best Thing Ever, and no dessert can possibly compare to her. She is my appetizer, main course, and dessert - all rolled into one!  After we thoroughly enjoyed the evening's repast, it was time to take in the intoxicating views - both of my lovely company, and the lighted Valley below.  We also had a wonderful, yet brief time, visiting with Ian as we discussed both our backgrounds of having lived in New York.  All through dinner, my wife and I were reminiscing about the last time we dined here. We were married shortly after that.   And she asked me, knowing what I know now, if I'd made made the right choice to marry here after ALL these years.  I told her, \"I'd still say YES!\"  And if you'd ask me if Different Pointe of View is still one of the Valley's premiere dining destinations, after all these years...  My response, \"Unequivocally, Yes!\"",

Our drinks were super delicious - we all ordered various martinis and cocktails. We all also ordered the filet mignon, and it was probably the best meal I've had in my life. After dinner, we sat outside and had champagne and desserts. The creme brulee was my favorite (we each got a different one and shared them) followed by the lemon blueberry cheesecake. It was chilly out, so they had an open fire pit where the staff was giving everyone marshmallows to roast. It is a super fancy restaurant with stunning views of Phoenix. If I lived in the area, I would make this my go-to spot for fancy celebrations. Even though I was only here once, I can tell this restaurant has maintained its prestigious reputation for nearly 40 years.",

I loved their Caesar salad and their prime rib was delicious. Or server was very attentive and friendly.  The view was very pretty, but we came at night so I think we missed the prime time to see it.  I would suggest that staff talk a little quieter. I heard someone (couldn't tell her position) ask a bus boy if we were done because they needed the table, a little loud and snappy. We were only there for 30 minutes at that time. I understand it was extremely busy and a holiday, so people we're stressed, but I didn't like hearing it. I'll still keep it at five stars since the food and our server was so good.",

    "text": "My client/friend took me here for dinner after a closing.   Gosh, darn, I sure am lucky.  The restaurant sits at the top of a hill.   Therefore, the views are PHENOMENAL!     We started off with a bottle of wine, Francis Ford Coppola 2012 Pitagora Red Blend.   Not a bad bottle of wine.   Really not.  They brought warm french bread with an assortment of butters and oil.  And even though I am not all that crazy about bread, the butters and oils weren't bad.   It was your standard warm french bread.  After checking out the menu, we decided to get the beet salad.   I didn't eat much of it.   It was tasty, but not really something I would order again.   Nothing about it stood out. Tiny balls of beets with their accompanying greens.  Our main courses, though, now, that was a different story.   I had the Pan Seared Diver Scallops and she had the swordfish.    I wish I had tried her swordfish, but she said it was quite good.   My scallops, yummmm!!   It had four large scallops, and accompanying it was angel hair pasta.   The scallops' taste was perfect with the right blend of spices and herbs.   The pasta was decoratively rolled, and, once unraveled, the flavoring in the pasta was perfect as well.   It was accompanied decoratively by carrots.  The main draw for the restaurant is its views.   WOW!!   Eye popping.   during good weather, it would be nice to sit on the patio for, say, happy hour after a long day's work.     I'm sorry to say I forgot the server's name.   Bob, maybe?   He was quite attentive, friendly, and professional.",

So, we went to the Terrace for drinks/apps which is just one floor below and has the same identical App menu. We sat on the patio there & had a great time. We went upstairs for our dinner at 0730. I had the salad with blood orange vinagraitte which was delicious and then I had the filet and my friend had the hanger steak. My steak was delicious. It came with something weird on the side that I didn't care for, but I had enough with everything else I had eaten. My friend loved her hanger steak and it came with some sort of mushroom risoto deliciousness. We ended by splitting the apple dessert and it was great. Our waiter, Bob seemed a little aloof and annoyed when we asked questions about the menu items/wine list. Since it was packed on a Saturday, I wonder if they are pressured to get people in & out? Not really sure. He did a great job of bringing our food out in a timely manner & keeping drinks filled. My meal with a salad, filet, and a glass of wine & half the dessert cost was 70$ I honestly don't think that is that expensive as some others have reported. $70 for a nice, upscale dinner is pretty much expected. This place is beautiful with great views and great food. Would definitely return.",

Our server for the evening was Ian and he performed in an exemplary manner as expected.  Unknown to me, when presented with the bill, the gratuity was already included.  This had never occurred before.  Not realizing this, I added a twenty percent tip to a significant amount.  Fortunately for me, Ian brought this to my attention both verbally and showed me my error even after I had completed the credit card transaction. To my relief,  Ian kept his word and did not run the extra tip through on my credit card.  It is so rare to find a waiter with this kind of integrity.  He is to be commended.   For my next visit to the Different Point of View, I will ask for Ian to serve my party if he is available.",

The view can't be beat as the restaurant is in the Tapatio Cliffs Resort.  If making a reservation, request a window table and try and go at sunset, you will have a stellar view over downtown Phoenix.  The wine steward was very helpful in helping us choose a wine that paired well with our meals.  We tried the spare rib ravioli for our appetizer.  The ravioli was good and the corn relish that accompanied the ravioli was sweet and creamy.  I had the filet and my husband had the pork.  My filet was cooked to temperature and the horseradish sauce and white bean puree that accompanied the dish were delightful.  Every bite melted in my mouth.  My husband's dish was also splendid and cooked to perfection.  We had the \"turtle\" dessert that was on the sweet side, which I love so it was a nice mix of mousse and chocolate crunch.  The presentation of each dish was its own piece of art and almost made you not want to bite into it.  And the little details were also there, like the de-crumbing of our table.  I always expect this at fine dining venues, but have been disappointed many times in the Phoenix area, but not here.  If you want a romantic night out, with an amazing view of the valley, and fantastic food, I suggest you check out Different Pointe of View.",

The restaurant is what it is, look to spend over $100 a person and stop at McDonald's on the way home to fill up.  If you have the money, or need a place for a fancy occasion, don't hesitate.  The service was great and the food delicious (at 5-star portions).  The great thing: you can get domestic bottled beer for $5, and some cocktails (including Bacardi) for $7.  My advice is to head into the bar, grab a drink, and find a spot at a table or couch outside.  You can see the entire valley, and relax by their fire pit/water feature.  Sunset is the best, although I'd recommend a drink before dark and another after.  In all fairness, they could charge you $10 just to come take a peek at their view, and you'd gladly oblige.  It's a great place to take photos, or maybe somebody you want to marry.  I'll stick to drinks, and you better bet you'll see me outside any time someone comes to visit!",

And there are restaurants you go to for the view......Different Pointe of View is the undisputed champ in the latter category. The food is good, about what you'd expect for the price (but that's not why you're here). You're here because those twinkling lights of Phoenix spread out before you both  will whisper sweet nothings to her like nothing YOU could ever think of. Nothing more romantic. So yo, Casanova,  if your love life needs that extra push off the (Tapatio) cliff, bring her here. And thank me later!",

The knowledge and talent of the chef and every staff member - the daily risotto i had on Saturday was a Parmesan and garlic risotto with duck mousse folded in, and slices of duck all around with a raspberry citrus sauce that was absolutely incredible - i ordered it on recommendation of our favorite server - Ian- i was a bit nervous because i don't like duck...BUT, i finished every bite! Chef Anthony, Ian, and really everyone, make it a fantastic, personal experience every time, and they keep us craving more of their excellent food, amazing personalities, and unmatched talent.",

Once there with our reservation, we were saddened to see our table was not next to the window, but we nevertheless had a great view. We had the duck ravioli, seared scallops, pork tenderloin, and blue cheese risotto. Oddly the risotto had previously unmentioned mushrooms and didn't taste like blue cheese. Overall, the food didn't disappoint and the portions were more generous than we're accustomed to for this kind of restaurant. Staff was friendly without issue. We would definitely come again for another special occasion.",

    "text": "Last night, I had one of the most delicious meals of my life at Different Pointe of View in Phoenix. I've never been to this gorgeous AAA Four Diamond restaurant overlooking Phoenix, part of the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort, and we were immediately treated to beautiful skies and glittering city lights.  I went there for the Insider's Point of View dinner, where Chef Anthony DeMuro prepares a four-course dinner tableside for only 12 guests. Attendees are treated to a wine reception with appetizers out at that breathtaking patio before heading in to the chef's table, with each course paired with a complementary wine. The dinner is held every month besides summer months, and this season goes through May 1. Every featured winemaker is different depending on the dinner, and last night, we were treated to the delicious J. Hofstatter wine from Italy, a winery dating back four generations.  We started out with Pinot Grigio out of the patio with an artichoke appetizer (Different Pointe of View was kind enough to offer vegetarian alternatives for me outside the regular menu -- they'll work with any dietary needs.) The atmosphere was relaxed and friendly, with lots of room for guests to spread out and take in the view.  As an introvert who gets nervous at group dinners, the chef's dinner was so much fun and low-stress. Diners are spread out around the makeshift kitchen, and Chef Anthony lets diners know exactly how he's cooking dishes -- it's like a live cooking show in such a romantic setting overlooking the city.  I love cooking but definitely can use all the tips I can get, and I learned a ton from Chef Anthony, especially in regards to risotto, a difficult dish to perfect, even for the pros. He advised to aim to get the rice crackling when it hits the oil-filled pan, and to treat it like pasta -- get it to the consistency you desire in the broth you're simmering it in, then drain it.  As someone who regularly botches any type of rice, I appreciated his tips. I also had purple cauliflower for the first time, in the absolutely amazing course featuring a spinach polenta cake, abalone and yellowfeet mushrooms, and a smoked tomato sauce. It was paired with a great Pinot Noir that was devoid of a heavy oak-y flavor, because J. Hofstatter wine is housed in stainless steel, not wooden barrels.  Our first course was light and refreshing but still really flavorful. My seafood-eating companion had lobster tail with a frisee salad with lemon zest, herbs, roasted garlic oil and garlic chips, while I had mine sans lobster.  I loved the crunchy texture, and it paired wonderfully with the J. Hofstatter Pinot Bianco, a crisp white wine. My companion doesn't normally prefer white over red wine, but he loved the Pinot Bianco.  Like Chef Anthony did a wonderful job at explaining the cooking process, winemaker Martin Foradori talked about the winemaking process and reminded diners how important acidity is when pairing wines with food. His vineyard has altitudes up to 6,000 feet, and it was really neat to hear about making wine in Italy while we sipped his vino.  While we noshed on the veggie polenta dish, our companions enjoyed wild boar.  My favorite dish of the night was the herb risotto with golden beets, artichoke hearts and a broccoli rabe sauce -- meat-eaters got short ribs braised in veal stock. It was paired with J. Hofstatter's Lagrein red wine, which is generally related to a Syrah, compared to the elegant Pinot Noir. Foradori described this wine as fresh and fruity, and it was a great addition to the tasty dish.  Of course, dessert was a treat, a chocolate cherry balsamic cake with chocolate ganache and a chocolate balsamic sauce. The texture was moist and creamy, and I tried to get every last drop of sauce to cover the cake. I loved the cherry flavor, which related well to the red wines, too.  The dining experience was more than a two-hour feast, and it was so much fun, in addition to making my stomach so happy. The wine dinner is a great value at $99 a person, because you get unique one-on-one time with the chef and so many tasty glasses of wine in addition to the farm-fresh dishes that are incredibly healthy.  The next dinner is Friday, March 6, with wine's from Italy's Tedeschi Wines. Reservations can be made by calling (602) 866-6350.",

Yes, price matters too, but that's not going to keep me from going.  DPOV hits every point!  Pun intended!  The food is impeccable.  The view is the best in AZ.  The service, provided by Nash, was top notch!  His recommendations were spot on, his style was informative, but not pushy.  Knows when to jump in and when to lay back.  Either way...if you are looking for a romantic dining experience, no need to look further.  This one is the one you are looking for!  Stop looking, put down the phone and go to A Different Point of View...oh, and ask for Nash!",

    "text": "Different Point of View is a Lovely Restaurant with Breath taking Views. Most of the food and Service I had was very good. This would be a Four star review if a few execution problems didn't occur. I am basing my rating on price point.  Both entrees were less than warm especially the New York Strip. I don't order steak often but when I do I look forward to a very good steak that's tender, tasty and hot like off the grill.  My husband thought the steak was cold but I say it was room temperature. I didn't send it back or say anything because it was tasty and cooked nicely and I didn't want it cooked more and I also didn't want my husband's Pork to sit more. My waiter did come to check on us and asked how it tasted and I said fine because it did taste fine.  At this point I was teetering between three and four stars.  But another execution problem occurred with the Chiffon Date Cake. The cake is made ahead of time and kept chilled in a refrigerator. I am certain that freshly made the Pistachio Cream is delicious but after chilling it just turned into hard putty that you can't eat. Other issues with this dessert are I didn't recognize anything in the Chiffon Date Cake as Dates. I don't know if the cake had dates in it. I don't know if I got the wrong one either.  I tasted the cake and to be honest it tasted like a dry sorta sponge cake. I do note the coconut lime saffron sorbet was delicious and I used that to soak and moisten up the dry sponge of cake. I did question the waiter about the cake and he assured me I had the correct one. He also said the pastry chef was on vacation.  Even with the Summer Menu Pricing I feel three stars is an accurate rating for the execution of the steak and dessert in an upscale place.  Possibly a slightly off night.",

Pea Shoot Salad is badly conceived and almost inedible. The shoots were tough and the table knife I had was oddly useless and would not cut them. When I did get a few to taste it was like eating pieces of hay and just as tasteless I tasted a friend's kale salad and that was the better choice The Duck Confit was just ok. Risotto was good, not much to the duck  Dessert selection was ok but I missed a pure chocolate selection.  Service was excellent - that deserves 5 stars",

We arrived early and sat on the downstairs patio to have a drink - the server who saw us in was less than accommodating and definitely not super friendly. She looked at her watch, told us we were really early and shoved a couple of drink menus to us and walked off.   Fortunately the service significantly approved after this. They gave us a table by the window with a beautiful view and our server was wonderful! Very knowledgable about the menu and various offerings, provided some great recommendations. The food itself was VERY good - no complaints there. For dessert, I was stuck between two choices and the server surprised me with both :) They even put \"Happy Anniversary\" chocolates on top of the desserts.   Overall a really great experience that comes with a spectacular view. A little pricey but that's to be expected.",

However, I was not impressed with the food and I felt the service could have been better. We ordered the pork belly as an appetizer which was delicious! The bread that is brought out while waiting for our food was mediocre. Although the spreads that came with the bread were very good! I ordered the filet mignon, and it was ok. I did not think it was worth the $47 it cost. I have had incredible steak at other restaurants in the past, and I did not think it was worth the cost.  Our server was an older gentleman and was nice, although it took him awhile to check in with us. He brought dessert menus and we ordered the chocolate and PB which was very good, and had a cute \"happy anniversary\" chocolate on it. I was a little taken aback when our dessert was not comped as we were there for a special occasion and spent over $150 between my husband and I. Then after bringing the check, it took about 20 mins before our waiter came back.  I would probably come back again for the view and the drinks, but would probably not eat dinner there again.",

It was Arizona restaurant week and there were amazing items to choose from. I don't have a picture of the lobster bisque but let me tell you, it was the best lobster bisque I've ever had. My boyfriend had the pork belly and it was delicious as well.  The entire dinner was delicious. No part of the meal was disappointing. Everything was flavorful and came at a good time. Our server was very attentive. The bread and dip was incredible as well. The pesto mixed with the cheese was out of this world.  The only thing that would have made this better was getting an outside seating since my boyfriend requested it a week in advance.",

Our server guided us through the summer pre-fix three course meal with wine pairing.  We both started with the lobster bisque which was paired with a prosecco.  The lobster bisque was very rich and loaded with flavor.  The prosecco was excellent since it wasn't overly sweet and more on the dry side.  My wife ordered the sea bass, while I ordered the steak.  The sea bass was paired with an excellent Sauvignon Blanc while my steak was paired with a very nice Chardonnay.  I have to admit though the steak was good the sea bass was the highlight of our dining experience.  We finished our meal with the passion fruit caramel creme and the chocolate sorbet.  Though we were both full, we enjoyed the refreshing desserts.  We are glad the front desk staff recommended this restaurant and that they were on Open Table so it was easy to make reservations and we also got points on top of it.",

    "text": "Came here for a special dinner with friends because one of my best friend's was getting proposed to as a surprise! I helped organize the dinner, we had to seat 10 and potentially with an accessible table so they sat us in the very entrance of the restaurant in which the lighting during the day was not prime for picture taking. Since it was a busy Saturday night we went with it, but I moved the surprise proposal outside. I let the hosts know and asked them to help me determine where we'd be able to get a good group shot, and my friend photographer (a friend with a camera - no professional photographers allowed, by the way) to hide. We decided on the west side outdoor patio area as there were no other people there. The host let the bar manager know of the surprise and I asked for 10 glasses or champagne  to toast to our friendship outside, still, under the guise of the surprise proposal. When the bar manager came out with the champ she said \"congratulations!!!\" To the table And almost ruined the surprise but we tried to shrug it off and it recovered quickly.   The views here are spectacular. At almost any point of the restaurant. The food was absolutely delicious, as were the cocktails. We shared a few appetizers and they were also well-seasoned, well-prepared and quite gratifying.   We did feel as though our server was not in the cheeriest of spirits and seemed to somewhat be rushing us, which wasn't very enjoyable. I don't know if it was because we were laughing and enjoying ourselves so heartily but for the amount of money spent and time we spent there - we shouldn't have felt this way at all.   They automatically added 20% gratuity, which is expected, but we added quite a bit additional because the food was so delicious, and the views - as I mentioned... breathtaking!",

Ambience: Amazing with views of the city you can't beat.  Food: Medicore  For our appetizer we ordered the pork belly ravioli and that was pretty good. They also brought out bread with 3 different spreads (raspberry butter, a pesto sauce, and goat cheese sauce). The raspberry butter was pretty good but the pesto sauce was definitely the best!  For our entree we both ordered the filet mignon and that's where the dinner took a turn for the worst. It was covered in a bleu cheese sauce that completely threw off the entire meal! It was so disgusting I tried so hard to eat it but it was smothered and I HATE bleu cheese. The potatoes that came with the filet were good but we wasted $47 on a steak I couldn't even eat.  For dessert we got the Carmel apple cheesecake and that was good but so small it was a joke.   Great view but food was not worth the money at all.",

Everything was cooked perfectly and the wine pairings were perfect. The view, romantic ambience and service have all be perfect as well. The meals were so perfect, I've overlooked the inconvenient truth that in both occasions, large insects needed to be killed by a server that was observed by several people trying to enjoy the evening. Overall, I'd rate the dining experience a 4.8/5 because of this. We will return again soon. It's worth it THAT much.",

Had a great summer prixe Fixe menu deal for 44$ which included an appetizer, entree, and dessert. Service was good but not great, same with the food. It didn't take my breath away but I enjoyed myself. I personally had the sea bass and wasn't terribly impressed but it was a generous portion size. I feel as though there was a lack of flavor, and it could have been developed more. Scallops are a favorite, and the garlic thyme steak looked very good.",

From the mountain top at 6pm when the sunsets this is the place to be. Watching the sun settle over the valley as you sip on your favorite drink and eat some of the tastiest meals that tickle your palette.   My most recent experience was last Friday. I did a double date night with out of town guest. We arrived right in time to watch the sunset as we sat inside near the window. The perfect view for a late night affair. The four of us were proudly served by two gentlemen Nash and Tunde. These two served some of the pickiest eaters in the world, however had the most patience and polished menu enterprise a patron could admire. Every suggestion from the drinks, appetizers down to the entree were amazing. Not one person at our table complained. If anything we were planning our next date night experience here.   I have to appreciate not only was the food amazing the level of sincerity and calmness the staff had. Everyone we encountered was friendly. Making our over all experience feel very welcomed.",

    "text": "We went for a special occasion. Really hoped to rate this place higher. The main reason for only three stars was the service. The second item that lowered the overall rating was some of the food was good, not great for the price. Here we go.  Atmosphere: hard to beat the view at this place. We sat at a table by the window after the sun had already gone down. Beautiful city light views, hard to beat. The restaurant does feel a little dated. We sat on the patio after dinner, but this place closes pretty early and they asked several of us couples to leave because they were closing. They were very friendly about it, but it was a bummer since it was still pretty early and we were enjoying the view. We did have a cool experience and saw a snake on the outside front stairs on our way out to our car. We really did think that was cool since this restaurant is built on the mountain. Overall I give the atmosphere an 8.5 out of 10.  Service: this is where the rating really suffered. We arrived and found nobody upfront to lead us to our table. Not the end of the world, but not great. Our waiter, a middle-aged gentleman who was thoroughly forgettable, was not friendly at all. I don't believe in the two hours we were there that he smiled once. He was not helpful or prompt in any way. He was decidedly not-excited to share specials or make recommendations for those of us who had never eaten there before. It seemed apparent that he did not want to be there and was entirely uninterested in providing positive, quality service. He genuinely dragged down the overall enjoyment factor. I would rate service a 5 out of 10, and only that high because our serving assistant/bus person was friendly.  Food: the food was good. Not exceptional. My wife's meal was outstanding, I remember mine was good, but we've already forgotten what I ordered, clearly it was unremarkable. I do also recall that the portion size was not large, just adequate. The various sauces and butters for the bread were so bland that they weren't enjoyable. Wine was not great. However, the overall quality and presentation of everything was good. I rate food 8 out of 10.  Value: reasonable, a bit on the expensive side for the quantity. I rate value 7.5 out of 10.  Overall: the big question is, would I return? I would give \"A Different Pointe of View\" a second chance if I knew we would have a different server. It probably would have improved our overall rating by one additional star. Would I recommend you try it? I would, but with cautious optimism.",

I also enjoyed the cocktails, and a member of our group had wine, and had eaten at the restaraunt before and enjoyed the wine selection on that visit as well. I didn't care for the restaraunt manager or wait staff very much -- stiff and absoluely NO sense of humor, but I cannot fault delilvery or the ability to answer questions, the no sense of humor thing was a personality thing and I probably shouldn't be trying to make jokes with every waiter I come accross anyway.

First of all, this was on a Saturday night and the restaurant was completely booked up with a wedding on the bottom half and a physician's dinner on top.  There were 100+ of us on top and the hor'dourves were that they served were excellent!  They even had a vegetarian one for my  wife!  My Favorite was the lobster casadia!  After drinks, they escorted us off the terrace and into the restaurant.    Appitizer: Crab Cake w/ lemon juice and some sweet sauce  YUMMMMMMMY! I would come back JUST for this!  (After living in Louisville, KY, it's been hard to find good food here in the valley. )  Salad: Arugula with strawberries, goat cheese and balsamic dressing.  Main Course: PERFECTLY cooked steak and sea bass with potatoes.   (Now, remember... FULL wedding below and 100+ people on top.. everything came out perfect...even my wife's vegetarian dishes.)  If you ever go to functions where they feed a LOT of people the same dish, you will find a lot of the time that the vegetarian dishes are usually a LOT better...in this case, it was the opposite!

    "text": "My DH took me here after a year of dating back in '03. We were staying at Tapatio so decided to make reservations for the Saturday night stay of our visit. Upon arriving, we were both impressed with the ambiance and were greeted/seated immediately.   The view is amazing, to say the least. This particular evening in early September, there was the most AWESOME monsoon like storm that created a fantastic lightshow across the sky. Of course the 70 mph winds were a bit scary...but it wasn't anything a good bottle of wine couldn't cure! ;0)  As the wind howled and shook the floor to ceiling windows, my (now) DH, felt compelled to find out from the waiter just how many mph the windows could stand. He said about 130 mph...phew!   So we started with \"the chefs special\" appetizers which the waiter so coyly alerted us was the second to last one. Before we could determine if we even wanted an appetizer, he brought it out to our table. Honestly, I have NO clue what it was except that it was wrapped in slices of eggplant...and was divine!  Next up, salad for me, chowder for my DH. (Yeah, CHOWDER in AZ...right....I'm from Seattle so know what good NW chowder is) The DH loved it though and I had to agree that my little spring mix salad was rather delightfully light.  As for our entree's....I couldn't even begin to tell you what we had for dinner that night. Perhaps it was at this point that between the wine I'd been drinking and the increasing intensity of the storm, my mind grew fuzzy. All I know (and the hubs can attest to this as well) is that the meals were PHENOMENAL! I must have raved about that meal for MONTHS...it was truly a very romantic evening made even more \"electrifying\" by the storm!",

I was pleasantly surprised by is place! We took our in laws and aunt and uncle to this place after they had driven across country to snow bird. Needless to say, they were ready for a delicious meal. The wait staff was friendly, but a bit slow, hence the 4 instead of 5 stars. My in-laws took their time perusing the wine menu, but we did not receive the dinner menu until after our bottle of wine was presented by the sommelier. He was an interesting gentleman with a great sense of humor. He was definitely the highlight of our evening service wise.     Once we ordered, after about 20 minutes after we were seated, the food arrived promptly. First we received the most awesome bread, pesto dip, and goat cheese dip. YUMMY!! Then our appetizers arrived. We ordered pork belly and scallops. The scallops were served with a coleslaw and a citrus-like sauce. Our meals were little pieces of heaven. I ordered the lobster and pancetta wrapped prawns. It was served with a rice cake. OMG the best meal ever. My hubby ordered a filet and it was perfectly cooked. My inlaws had the halibut which was my least favorite of the meals, but still excellent.       This place is not cheap, so be prepared to spend a pretty penny.. However, it is really great food and worth every penny!! The view is phenomenal; the city looks serene and calm from high above!",

We made reservation a week before and when we went in around 8pm, there was no line and the waitress told us to wait in the lounge for a bit while she looks for a table. We didn't mind the wait at all. The tables were set up very nicely, it had a romantic atmosphere for us which I really appreciate. Once we were seated our menus came out right away. We ordered the lobster bisque, scallops, and the brisket. As we were waiting for our food we decided to take pictures and one of the waiter was kind enough to take a picture of us. They brought out bread and some dips which was absolutely AMAZING! I could not stop eating it. The lobster bisque, IS TO DIE FOR. I've never tasted anything that good before! The scallops was a bit salty for my liking but it didn't bother me too much. It was beautifully presented and delicious! My boyfriend got the brisket and he said it was very juicy and tender. For our dessert, we got a discount for having a chocolate piece that says happy anniversary on it.   Since we went at night, when we finished our dinner, we went outside to look at the city lights. It made me BREATHLESS! I fell in love with the scenery. This is definitely a night I will never forget :) Beautiful sightings and wonderful delicious food. What more can you ask? :D",

The table next to us, with a full great view, stayed vacant the entire time we were there.  I'm assuming they like to keep diners together.    My halibut with laughing bird shrimp and peruvian purple potatoes was to die for, I ate the whole thing.  My husband was just okay with his veal cheeks, didn't care for the sauce and wished he had ordered the halibut too.  The dessert menu was very odd, we didn't order anything, but they brought us a little dessert that had \"Happy Anniversary\" stenciled on the plate, nice touch.",

    "text": "We recently moved to Scottsdale, AZ and I was looking for a restaurant with a great view and a great menu for my wife's birthday. I found several recommendations for 'Different Pointe of View'.   We arrived around 6pm and were seated inside at a table that was front center looking out over the valley. BEAUTIFUL view!!! The restaurant was clean and very quiet. During our visit only 3 other parties dined. If you want a quiet atmosphere, you will find it here. I found it odd that there wasn't background music.  We ordered the Lobster Bisque and a Strawberries & Baby Wild Arugula salad. Both were fresh and very tasty. We followed with our main courses, Cold Water Diver Scallops and Wild California Halibut. Our waiter attempted to have the sommelier select a wine for us but he was no where to be found. The Maitre d' finally came over to assist. He made selection that they didn't have. I selected a Merlot and it was very good. They have an impressive wine list and cellar.  Our main courses arrived and I knew right away that my wife was not happy with her scallops. My halibut was delicious. We tried each others and I found the scallops VERY over seasoned, burnt on the exterior and cold in the center.... they were to the point of almost being inedible. Our waiter did not return to see how the meal turned out so I switched meals with my wife. It was her birthday and I avoided raising a disturbance when our waiter finally returned, after we had finished our meal. I ate the worst $32 main course of my life. After a VERY DISAPPOINTING main course we avoided dessert. Portions were undersized and expensive for the quality. We will not be returning for dinner. We might for a drink on the patio.   'Dissapointing Pointe of View'",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went here on Valentine's day of 2009, hoping for a romantic dinner. It was anything but. First of all, the drive up there, in a manual, almost gave my boyfriend a heart attack!! The random useless signs that \"try\" to direct you to your destination are more in the way than they are helpful!   After we FINALLY get to the top, we are greeted by a couple of very nice, and well dressed young men who politely direct you to the restaurant. This place is absolutely gorgeous. I recommend that everyone eat here at least once. Once we got up, past the lounge area, to the receptionist we of course received a bit of attitude. (happens all the time)  My boyfriend and I like to eat out a lot, since we haven't the time to cook for ourselves, and since we both are only 19 and look quite young, we tend to run into people who assume that we are the \"typical\" teenagers. You know, rowdy, cheap and obnoxious. Either that or spoiled because of how expensive this place is.   Anyways, after the receptionist barely acknowledged our presence, we were sat in a booth, far from the huge glass windows. I really wish we were closer, but a booth for a romantic dinner is probably the best way to go. Once we got seated, we were addressed by an older man, who definitely did not seem happy with his new table. His introduction was short and sweet. Since the menu was pre fixed, he suggested that we order one of each option so that we may try everything. I can at least thank him for that.   The biggest issue that I had, really didn't have anything to do with the restaurant. There was a couple sitting next to us in another booth, practically having sex!   Back to the topic, the service after we ordered was very disappointing. We had waaay too many people waiting on us. We had the main server, and 3 food runners/bussers. So we were constantly interrupted.   The food was delicious though, and the presentation was phenomenal. Definitely have to make a reservation here.  Our bill came out to be about 230, and then a 60 dollar tip, so 290 total.  Be prepared to spend.",

I could not have been happier.  The seat was the last one in the windowed corner providing us both with a spectacular view, and allowed us to focus on each without distraction from other diners.  My wife had mussels for appetizer, poached lobster and bacon wrapped prawns, aged cheddar gnocchi  and Creme brulee. I had Chef's Tasting Menu which consisted of a duck based appetizer, deconstructed pan seared diver scallop salad, sesame crusted seared ahi tuna, lemon ice palate cleanser,  pork tenderloin finished with a chocolate cake desert and mocha ice cream served with a hot cocoa sauce.  Overall, I could not have asked for a better meal or service.  I always felt extremely well served, without it feeling at all intrusive.  The waiters knew the dishes and suggested excellent pairings for my wife.  The full meal with each of us having 3 drinks came out to a little over $220.  So it is not an inexpensive place to eat, but well worth the experience.  We will definitely be going back, and now consider this one of my top choices for a nice romantic night with my wife.  Also, if you are just looking for a nice place to have a drink.  The Terrace Bar has excellent views and the drink prices are pretty reasonable given the location.  Another great find from Yelp.",

To our dismay, our food was served, our server asked if it was okay (as it was placed), and then never returned to our table until the meal was over.  We had a steak which was significantly undercooked (purple as opposed to medium rare), but we never had the opportunity to send it back.  In management's defense, they removed the charge from our bill, which we truly appreciated.  Unfortunately, our server then returned to argue with us about whether he should have come and checked on us.  Unbelievable and extremely disappointing.",

We opted for the Chef's tasting menu and were thoroughly impressed!  Our first item was an amazing scallop and shaved fennel salad.  The scallop was prepared perfectly!  This course was paired with a lovely glass of Roussanne.  Next we had a spectacular salad that there is no way I can do it justice by explaining it. Pears, pecans, blue cheese  - trust me  - AMAZING!  This course was paired with a Syrah Rose - Fun!  Moving on - Halibut served with Gnocchi and Lobster.  Again - perfect and served with a blend of Viognier and Marsanne. Our final dish was filet served with risotto and paired with Mourvedre. The service was outstanding and of course the view is worth every penny.  Want to impress or wow a date, business partner or in-law - Different Pointe of View will deliver every time!",

We were seated at what I would say is the best table in the place. We were in a position where we had a perfect panoramic view, in a top corner where there was no reason for anyone to walk by and very intimate. Our server was extremely attentive and all the wait staff was on top of everything from refilling water, cleaning off the table and making sure we had everything we needed.  We went during restaurant week and had the 3 course meal. The lump crab salad was refreshing, my entree of a pan seared whitefish on a bed of squash puree accompanied by artichokes and shitaki mushrooms was excellent and to finish the meal off, I had the chocolate espresso cup for dessert which had homemade espresso ice cream on a rich chocolate cake with marscapone cheese...wonderful. We enjoyed a great bottle of Chardonay that remained chilled during our dinner tableside. After dinner, we sat in the terrace which was absolutely beautiful. I cant wait to find another time to go again. We live near South Mountain so it is not in our area but it is truly worth the drive",

    "text": "I've eaten at this restaurant a couple of times now, and had a really nice experience both times. However, I have to qualify that by stating that both times have been with large (large = ~300 people) groups. And I haven't paid a dime out of my pocket either time. And I was driven back to the hotel on a small bus, with a cold drink in my hand. Which would probably make for a nice experience at just about any restaurant.   That said, this place is great for private events with a lot of people. Lots of patio space for pre-dinner drinks and appetizers while everyone soaks in the view. Yeah, it can get hot out there, even in the early evening, but if you're fortunate enough to have a breeze blowing, it's not too bad. And after dinner, when the sun is long gone, and you're enjoying a drink with the city lights twinkling before you, it's pretty damn cool (literally and figuratively).  I've had both the filet and fish, and neither has disappointed, although I will say that the prosciutto glazed sablefish I had last time really had no evidence of prosciutto having been involved (which, of course, was the only reason I chose that dish. Prosciutto = bacon = yum). Disappointing. But the fish itself was cooked well and flavorful. The filet is excellent, although they did have some trouble getting the right done-ness out to everyone. No problems with taking it back and getting it right, though.  I think the cost of their regular menu is about  $40-50 per entree, and with that in mind, I'd say this would be a better spot for drinks and a couple of appetizers, or even after dinner drinks. I don't think I'd be too pleased with dropping $150 for dinner and drinks based on the food I've had. Yeah, it was good...but not particularly memorable, and for that amount of money, I'd probably want to go with a Ruth's Chris or Flemings, or a similar high end steakhouse.  But hey...if the view and ambiance are what you're after, you'll definitely get that here, and plenty of it. Perfect spot for a romantic evening.",

    "text": "I must say... I was really looking forward to having dinner here. We were on a quick weekend get away in Scottsdale for my 32nd birthday, and I booked this place to celebrate with the love of my life.   Boy oh boy, what a disappointment !!! We arrived, and I was impressed with the atmosphere, decor, and the fantastic view stretching across the phoenix urban sprawl. When we checked in with reception, we were informed that we would have a 10mn wait to be seated outside.  \"10mn ? Not a problem !\", I said, and continued on to state that we would grab a drink at the bar and sit outside to take a look at the view, while we waited to be seated in the dining area.  And we waited. And waited. And waited. All the time, seeing free seats being taken by others (although there was no one waiting behind us). We ended up asking about it, and they were quite rude, did not apologize, and ended up telling us that they had been looking for us, but we were no where to be found, which is IMHO a load of bullocks, given that we had made eye contact with the floor manager several times during our wait. In the end, we got seated by the bus table, still outside, my mood souring by the minute... but hey, it was my birthday, I wasn't going to let something like that ruin the moment.  I wasn't surprised by the prices, as I knew what we were getting into. I was however, surprised by the crappy quality of the dinner we had for the $ we paid.   They brought the perfunctory \"amuse gueule\", which was a joke, to be honest. If I was a restaurant manager, I would be literally embarrassed by what they deigned to serve: 2 table spoons of some sort of artichoke bisque served in a large mug... makes you feel like someone scraped the bottom of a soup pan and was serving you yesterday's leftovers from the local penitentiary. I was quite unimpressed. Gordon Ramsey would have had a fit.  At this point, we were also annoyed with the high powered, halogenic lights, that are pointed right in your face, literally blinding you when the beams catch you at the right angle... I was starting to have a head ache, as was my wife.  They then came around to serve us some bread and pesto butter, which I must say was pretty nice tasting.... (but come on,... how hard is it to screw up bread??).  We perused the wine menu, and decided to order a South African white chardonnay, from the Stellen Bosch region (Mirlest white)... which was pretty good. Nice touch was that we didn't finish the bottle, and they re-corked and bagged it for us before leaving... which was a plus...  As a starter, I had the pan seared foie gras... which was a bit too gelatinous for my liking (have had way better)... the waffles were a nice touch. It reminds me of a restaurant in Paris that used to serve foie gras with ginger bread... quite nice... the sweet and salty combo always works wonders.  My wife ordered the Chevre walnut tarte... one piece of advice... stay the hell away from it. Its mainly a medley of thick, sandy crust and walnut powder,  with ABSOLUTELY NO DETECTABLE trace amounts of goat cheese.... For 11$, it was an absolute rip off. The server initially didn't react when we told him that this dish was absolutely not a success... however, he did later take it off the bill.  My wife just had a really unlucky evening. Being vegetarian, she ordered the Vegetarian Trilogy.  What this ended up being was a soggy vegetable lasagna, served with a supposed macademia truffle sauce that tasted more like peanut butter, except that it was even more bland and greasy.... The truffle scented gnoccis that we ordered as a side dish, looked like, and tasted like stale, soggy, greasy fries... yuck.  I however ordered the diver's scallops and lobster, which was pretty good. Not the softest lobster, but damn tasty, and the scallops were perfect, and huuuge.   No dessert, as we were pretty disgusted with the whole experience.  Net/net: expensive place, crap value for money, food is totally hit and miss, but the view is nice, if they can deign paying attention to the service they provide....",

We were greeted so warmly when we checked in with the hostess and it seemed every one on the staff was aware of our special day.  Our waiter was very attentive, but never interrupted our conversation.  Needless to say, the views are spectacular and the food was amazing.  There brought us so many different breads and unique dips and sauces to try almost as soon as we were seated.  My dinner had a half dozen different combinations of flavors, different meats and sauces.  The deserts were delicious and it even had a customized \"Happy Anniversary\" chocolate integrated into the design.  It was just an amazing experience and I know we'll be going back.",

The lounge area was beautiful , staff was very helpful and professional. Then the restaurant, ok at best- we don't want to be rushed and they brought the salad out within two minutes after we ordered only one of the two and they served myself first not my wife, not polite. We had a bottle of wine, no one from the service staff offered to politely  refill our wine glasses something that we noticed at several tables- next the main course was brought out again to me first, it was the wrong order- serve the female first, be polite. food was fair, not great. All in all Point of View, the view is great, the food is Ok and the service needs more attentiveness compared to the rating. Enjoy the view - the Point is ok, not great from a culinary point of view.",

    "text": "I returned to DPOV for for the 4th time last weekend. There will most certainly be a 5th, 6th, and hopefully many more visits back to this treat of a dining experience.  For the first time, we were able to enjoy bar / lounge for cocktails before dinner.  It had not been completed when we were there last. It is really beautiful and very easy to get comfortable inside the lounge and to relax with a drink or two before going upstairs for dinner. The early evening was perfect outside,  so we also chose to spend time on the patio area watching the sun retreat for the day.  Dinner was excellent. We have yet to be disappointed. The view is really spectacular. We wished we would have been in a couple of days earlier to watch the electrical storm outside. I can only imagine how awesome it would be to observe from the peak. The Lobster Bisque is out of this world. I look forward to it each time I go! The fillet was cooked perfectly.  We also had the lobster and shrimp prosciutto. They were quite good as well.  The service was well paced and table staff is well informed and helpful.   Our only disappointment of the evening was that there was some confusion to the bar tab. We had closed out our lounge tab, However another parties drinks were added to our bill for the dinner in the transfer from the lounge to restaurant. Though it was corrected, the waiter was surely not convinced that the tab was not ours. This left us with a bitter taste in our mouth as we were leaving.  A five star performance fell to a 4 star over this one incident.  My suggestion, close out your lounge tab and take your receipt. This would have been more convincing and clear to the waiter and would have dispelled any doubt.  Though our trip to the Different Point of View is rare for us as we live out of state, we look forward to it each time we trek to Arizona. If you are looking for an upscale and unique dinner experience/ dinner with a great view, take the opportunity to go. Make reservations and ask for  a window seat, the view is really nice!",

Pretty good team.   The food, meh. The bread was great, its bread. A  soft focaccia and a ciabatta loaf, with three different butter options. Also pretty decent. I liked the one in the middle. Two of us ordered the lobster bisque, it was more cool than warm. The flavor was ok but lukewarm soup, weird. Also, I dont know if this type of soup is served at room temperature. A few other order the pear salad, they loved it. There was butter lettuce, pomegranate, pear(obviously), vinaigrette, and w slice of brie or goat cheese. Not sure which honestly. Finally, main courses. EVERYTHING was room temperature. That was the worst part i think, because the food was pretty delicious. Some people asked for salt and pepper, i was okay w the natural flavors.  Wont be back but thank you for the view.",

It was a beautiful day and you could see forever!  Brunch was pretty much the usual upscale offerings----salads, soups, cheeses, seafood, a carving table, omelette and waffle station and a desert table.  But I have to note a couple of dishes that were memorable: the chilled roasted strawberry cider bisque (I would LOVE to have that recipe, it was so good!), a really good romaine salad and the short ribs.    BUT THE VIEW!  That just made it fabulous!  Our only caveat: the added in 20% gratuity----although, after consideration, I probably would have tipped closely to this.  Although our server did not serve our food, he was on top of things with our drinks and was quick to carry away soiled plates and cutlery and replace with clean.  I just don't like having a gratuity added without being told (we were a party of four!) and that with the tax added almost a $100 to the bill.  On the other hand: The View!",

Everything was great until we both got back to our hotel room and spent the whole night throwing up. My wife and I slept on the floor of the bathroom of our hotel because we were so sick. We shared the steak tartar, lobster bisque and dessert. We didn't share our entrees, so it had to be one of the above mentioned items.   I called in today to speak with a manager and of course I got a voicemail. I called the hotel where the restaurant is located and was transferred to voicemail three times there.    When I finally got in touch with the hotel manager I was told I needed to fill out a report with the head of security... what?  When I spoke with security they told me I could file a report and they would look into it. I told her I might just come down to the hotel and tell patrons about my experience at check in and I was told they would call the cops on me.   By far the worst hospitality experience I ever had. This wasn't some Mom and pop diner nor was it a cheap meal.   I spent $200 to throw up all night on my anniversary! I will never be back and I will do everything in my power to ensure that people hear about my experience. Terrible terrible terrible. Do not go here!",

Our reservation was late so it was dark, but it was beautiful seeing the city lit up at night. I'd love to come back to see a sunset.  Wasn't super impressed with the service. Our waiter wasn't friendly and the person refilling our water spoke to us more than our actual server did. Maybe because it was the end of the night. Still, for such a nice, fancy restaurant I would have expected a little more interaction and attentiveness from the actual waiter. Even though it was my birthday, they didn't offer any sort of dessert special, which was surprising because most restaurants (even fancy ones) tend to do so nowadays. Food portions were decent and flavorful. But the real reason I'd go back is to enjoy the the view.   Downstairs they have a bar/lounge with comfortable seating where you can order drinks/appetizers and enjoy the view. There's also a fire pit which is nice if it's a little chilly. Drinks and food are pricey and you're definitely paying for the ambience. Very romantic spot but next time I may opt for the lounge.",

I had the filet which was over-cooked, I requested med-rare. It didn't taste nearly as good as a steakhouse filet for $44.  I started with the lobster bisque, it was very tasty.

All four of our party ordered the 3 menu selections for $40. The selections were decent choices. The food had good flavor. The portion sizes were appropriate.  What really put me off was the formulaic approach to service, ie. zero, zip personality. The staff was polite and efficient but either didn't know or didn't care that their demeanor brought down the experience.   It was very obvious that no money has been invested in the restaurant furnishings for quite a long time. Worn carpeting, tables that need a good cleaning and dirty, stained chairs are just a few examples.  We love to have great places to take visiting family and friends too, but this will not be on the list.",

    "text": "The best dining experience I've ever had. If you're looking to woo someone, whether its a first date or you've been together for a long time, this is the place to go. I treated my boyfriend here for Valentines day, and we had an amazing time.   BIG NOTE: Finding it is a bit difficult if you're unfamiliar with the area and are using GPS. I didn't look too into the location, as I rely completely on Google Maps on my phone and that was a mistake. Look into the location and get a good idea of where it is. GPS will send you into a golf course. Its located at the Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort. We took a wrong turn (left at the first turn, you're supposed to go right), because of some work they were doing on the road that had us confused. When we finally did get there, we had a hard time figuring out how to get to the restaurant, as there is a section for parties/etc. The main dining area is at the top of the stairs. They were very accommodating of our lateness due to this, and we still got the table that we had reserved.  This is an expensive, up-scale restaurant. While they don't seem to have a dress code that you MUST follow (I saw a few people who were more on the casual side of dressy casual), I would recommend dressy casual and above for this restaurant. While the atmosphere is classy, the waiters do not seem like snobs of any sort. They are very professional, courteous, and happy to answer any questions.   I recommend booking in advance with a note for window or patio seating (your preference), and arriving right before sunset hours for the best views and experience.   The food is amazing. The portions seem small to anyone not used to more up-scale dining, but it is VERY filling and amazing..",

We first started out outside on the Terrace but, the wind was blowing like mad and dust and dirt was flying everywhere.  Our server was good she was attentive and quick with everything until they got busy. When the rest of our party arrived we moved back outside,that was about 45 min later,and at that time it was not quite as windy. We had eaten while we were inside. Lobster Bisque, which was just OK. It could of been hoter. We also got the muscles,which had no flavor at all. I do not know what they did to them. But I have never had muscles with so little flavor. We also got the Koble beef sliders. They were good, but should of had a better quaility of bun. Good Burger with good topping, just a cheap bun. The view was great up here,we loved that.  For such a high dollar place it should of been better food. The hotel was great,they drove us up to the top ,which would of been a horriable drive in my big truck. They will also take you down. Great customer service with that. While we were on the terrace the service was not so great. But, the experiance as a whole was pretty nice. They did not tell us that the tip was already on the bill though. So I guess that is how they make a little extra.",

    "text": "I've lived here my whole life (28 years, dude) and strangely enough have never been to this place. Well, I finally went here last night with my sexy-pants boyfriend. His pants are sexy.  So, it takes a few minutes to get to the actual restaurant. You drive higher and higher and higher and then directly into outer space. Finally, when you arrive to the top, complimentary valet is waiting for you. Which I zipped right past because I refuse to valet my expensive 2011 standard Golf. I probably should've valeted though, because then I was forced to walk up a slanted hill in 6\" heels and had to cling to sexy-pants boyfriend like an old lady with brittle bones. Once inside, you then go up yet another flight of stairs (don't worry, there's an elevator) where you are finally greeted by the hostess. The restaurant itself is interesting - large, glass windows so you can enjoy the view, said Captain Obvious. Aside from that, it's rather plain and even on the drab side. I'm not saying that's a negative. It could be purposeful to not retract from the view? I dunno. The view is seriously spectacular though! I love the desert and this only amplified my love for it. I know there's a lot of haters in Phoenix who talk shit about how ugly this city is. You shut your damn mouth. If you're one of these haters, I encourage you to visit places like this that give you a profound appreciation of how neat mountains and clear skies really are.  Onto the food: Pretty good! Expensive, as one would expect, but not outrageous. I ordered a \"micro greens\" salad with pistachios, pears, and some type of cheese I'd never heard of it. The salad was truly micro and was almost deconstructed, which I'm not a fan of. I'm lazy and don't want to put my food together. It came out on an overly-HUGE plate and I nearly guffawed at it! Hahaha! It looked really silly and even tinier. Overall though it was pretty good. I also had a side of fingerling potatoes and those were GREAT! S.P. Boyfriend had the chef's special, which was shrimp with kidney beans (I think, can't remember). It was very tasty. We followed all of that up with the peanut butter and chocolate cheesecake - definitely the highlight of the evening. The entire bill came to $76 - not bad! Afterward we went outside to check out the rest of the restaurant and made the treacherous trek back down to my baller car, where my boyfriend literally piggybacked me so I didn't have to break my ankles.  Overall, pretty cool place! Friendly staff, great views. Clearly I have run out of things to say.",

Furthermore, the furnishings, art and decor in general are all very classy, warm and inviting.  It definitely makes an impression.  Our waiters were a tad cold and lacked that ability to make us feel welcome.  The food is the main reason for the 3 stars.  It's pretty good but not outstanding.  In other words, the cuisine here is not like Elements or the quality of Cafe Monarch.  I would even say that Quiessence was better cuisine even though I much prefer the atmosphere here.  Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with the food here but we didn't walk away thinking that we had experienced a supremely talented chef.",

For our meals, we got the following:  [Amuse bouche] I forgot what it was exactly, but it consisted of tumeric wild rice and a piece of shrimp. Tasty and a nice introduction, although the rice was annoying to eat with our forks.  [Appetizer] Bread with 3 dips - The pepper pesto was hands down the winner, and the other two aren't worth mentioning. Butter lettuce salad - Decent, but a little too sweet for me. Lobster bisque - Very rich and creamy with a kick of smoky flavor.  [Entree] Halibut - Best dish in recent memory! Get this. Just do it. Roasted cauliflower risotto - Came with very tender pieces of beef. The risotto was cooked well, but it was unfortunately too salty for me to properly enjoy.  [Dessert] Espresso cup - The ice cream was delicious. The rest of it was okay.  After dinner, we took a trip outside to take in the view. We also explored the surroundings around the entrance, but it only led to an empty lot with the unflattering presence of a dumpster. Oh well!  The service was great, from the host calling to confirm the rsvp an hour after it was booked on opentable, to the sommelier suggesting a great bottle of wine, to the server making sure there was a candle in the dessert. Two thumbs up!  Totally coming back once it cools down to be able to dine/drink outside. Woohoo!",

Enter the lobby and they tell us we can wait for our table in lobby. We see some people with drinks but don't see a bar. So I ask hostess if there is a bar. \"Not tonight because there is a wedding just go wait in lobby \" That's kinda strange we think to ourselves, but  then it gets even weirder. As we are sitting in lobby as older couple sits down next to us and a server came and welcomed them and brought them each a glass of wine. We were completely ignored.   We were lead to our table (which was not a window view as Adam requested). We notice some waitstaff taking a rug and putting it over something right next to us. At that point we realize that they are using the rug to cover up vomit.   After a few minutes we notice there were a lot of high school kids having dinner before prom. One of the tables of them right next to us was so drunk the girl threw up! I immediately get up to tell the hostess I want to be moved and notice a vomit trail all the way to the bathroom.   We were relocated to a table in the very back of restaurant. Service was slow and inattentive. The guy knew I was gluten free because I had a few questions. Dinner was good.   After dinner. Waiter brought by dessert menus. We wanted to order something but he never came back. 10 minutes later he came back over and asked us what we wanted. I replied \"we would have ordered something 5 minutes ago but now we will just take our check. \".   They knew it was my birthday because Adam had written it on opentable. The guy came back with a birthday dessert and slammed it on the table with zero comments. No candles. Nothing. And it was the most gluten containing dessert option they has. Let me say that the people across from us got candles and a different dessert that I could have eaten.   Took 20 more minutes after this for us to finally get our check.   Horrible experience for such a special occasion.",

    "text": "I am not sure why so many people are raving about this place, it has to be the view and the service only. We went for an early Valentine's day dinner with reservations at 6:30pm, we showed up a little before that time and were told we would be seated early which would have been great beacuse the sun was setting, except for th fact that they left us seated back in an area where all we had a view of was people showing up after us and getting seated right away and a banquet room down a floor below the restaurant. Twice they came to us asking what the name was when clearly they were very confused and left us sitting longer in the waiting area. We both ordered drinks, I was craving a Bloody Mary and my husband a dirty Martini, It came so fast I was questioning what it was going to taste like. One sip of my Bloody Mary and it was obvious they just took vodka and a can of Bloody Mary mix poured it in a glass threw in some olives and said here ya go. My husband's Martini was very plain and not dirty and tasted like it came from a simple sports bar, both did not taste like something you would get from an almost 5 star restaurant. Once seated it was disappointing that we were seated at a table that was very close, almost in fron of. the one half of a double door that lead to the outdoor seating area. So close they had to shut half of the door and not use it since we were seated so close. Both of us had not had lunch so needless to say we had an appetite to please. Looking forward to a spectacular meal we ordered, I ordered the endive salad to start and a special they were having at that time which was Halibut with purple mashed potatoes with Artichoke and Asparagus in a lemon sauce. My husband ordered the Berkshire Pork Belly appetizer with some kind of bean sauce and the Vanilla Brandy Poached Lobster, I really wish I would have brought a camera and taken pictuires of what was served, I have to say they did bring bread before anything and that was excellent, also along with the bread they had a small dish with 3 separate areas and about a  tablespoon of each, maple butter, pesto sauce and some goat cheese sauce, hardly enough for 6 or 7 slices of bread. BTW this was my favorite part of our whole experience, the bread was great! Hubby gets his pork Belly appetizer and is very pleased, except it was a $6.00 pice of meat that they charged $14.00 for. Next came my endive salad, it came on a big plate with half of it out lined with about 8 Endive leaves and the rest of the plate was drizzled with what they called some kind of vinagarette and spinkles with crumbs of something, but it was truly comical how this looked, this huge plate with a few leaves of endive with some canned oranges they added for color. It looked like a 7 year old threw it together and also about the amount a 7 year old could eat. Next came our meal, the halibut dish looked great, nice size but very dry, the artichoke had some hard leaves left in it so that was not good picking that out of my mouth since it was unchewable, disappointing for $38.00 My husband's Lobster came and it was a claw and 2 other bits of lobster not even 4 oz of it , a couple of lobster raviioli that was full of what tasted like mostly cheese, it was crazy that they charged $42.00 for lobster bits which is what it should be called. His appetizer was bigger than his dinner. My husband asked the waiter what and if they had a signature drink and he said \"yes, we have a full menu\" uh, yah, ok forget it. He also asked our waiter for a chardaonnay to have with dinner and the waiter brought a 1/4 glass of wine which we found out later was $17.00 a glass. We thought ok, lets take dessert to go, how can they mess up dessert, well, they did. I ordered chocolate cream with Bruleed bananas, I didn't know the restaurant had only one banana for all the deserts that evening at least that is what it felt like I got about a 1/4 cup of something that resembled chocolate and had heavy cream in it with 2 small slices of bananas on top it was a joke and they charged $10.00 for that. My husbands was just as small and lacked any flavor other than Chocolate, it was called balsamic chocolate and cherry cake. at the end of it all our bill was $175.00 and we were so diappointed, my recommendation with be to go there for a beer and watch the sun set and don't eat, ask for bottled beer because you never know what you might get if you ask for anything else. You may end up paying $15.00 for a shot glass full of something else.",

There's meat on the menu, sure, but you may not recognize it as the descriptions are confusing to those of not in the habit of dining in these types of establishments.  I ordered a lobster dish.  I expected one thing, I received another.  Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, I just had trouble locating the lobster.  I found a hunk on noodle.  It was good.  Service is great.

    "text": "Our dinner at Different Pointe of View was perfect. We did the chef's tasting menu with the wine pairing and got completely spoiled. The tasting began with a succulent lamb tenderloin, which was a bit unorthodox, but what an excellent way to start! It was cooked a perfect medium rare and garnished with homemade gnocchi, mushrooms, and beet puree. Next was a seared diver scallop with a delicious little side salad, followed by the chef's special that night- Norwegian cod. Before the main event, we were given a lemon sorbet palate cleanser and a \"bonus\" shot of their DELICIOUS lobster bisque- which, by the way, was the best I've ever had! (And apparently took 30 hours to make!) Finally, we were served a melt-in-your-mouth braised short rib. The menu ended with their famous creme brulee and a chocolate turtle ganache. The wine throughout was just as epic- unique red and white grape blends from California and Arizona to compliment the chef's theme for the evening...which the sommelier apparently learns of as the chef goes! The portions and pours were some of the most generous I've experienced with a chef's tasting, and we somehow found it in ourselves to top off the evening with cappuccinos and chocolates before taking in the stunning views.   Did I mention the views? The giant windows open out onto a beautiful view of Phoenix and the surrounding peaks. And the patient staff are eager to usher guests to the balcony for individual photo shoots against the incredible backdrop.  And speaking of the staff, everyone was absolutely lovely. From the exceedingly friendly hostess who brought us drinks when we showed up half an hour early, to the gentleman who smiled at us each time he filled our water glasses, the staff was top notch. Our server was a trip- so much fun and so enthusiastic about sharing the entire experience with us. He felt like a friend by the end of the evening...as did our sommelier, who was warm, laid back, and joked with us as he relayed the stories behind all the wines.  I obviously can't praise this place enough.  Oh and P.S.- we're going back tonight for a wedding. Muahahahahaha. Round 2 suckaaaaz!",

We came here once again for a special occasion which was a farewell dinner for my mom who was visiting from South Africa. I had made a reservation using Opentable and asked for a nice view as a treat to my mom on her final night.   The hostess reserved us a table with a splendid an unrestricted view. We had a very attentive waiter - Luis - who treated us with colorful and informative descriptions of the menu. He also took care of us with an exquisite after dinner treat seeing as how mom was leaving.   The dinner was exceptional - as always, so was the atmosphere, the company and the wine. Do go here!   I suggest arriving a little before the dinner reservation to enjoy drinks on the patio while watching the sunset...always a treat! Call ahead of time to find out whether the patio will be open - it has happened to me twice that it was reserved for private functions. (Which was totally my bad - but maybe someone else can benefit from it.)",

One thing I did not like was when we checked out the server added 15% gratuity to our bill. We are usually 20% tippers even if the service is average so not sure why it was done for a party of 2. Would not go back.",

    "text": "The restaurant lives up to it's name by same, it's a \"different point of view\". I loved being able to look over the city at night and see all the way to downtown. My boyfriend and I had a great table towards the end of the restaurant and had a view of the city and the mountain. The restaurant was offering a \"summer prix fix\" menu that allowed you to get an appetizer, an entry, and a dessert for only $40. We decided to do that but wanted to share an appetizer before. I guess our server didn't understand us, and brought us two appetizers instead and after we explained the error he still charged us. The experience and food was great but I think the servers could be friendlier. At the end of the meal we wanted to get a picture so we went to the floor below the restaurant to take a picture and the two servers acted like it was such a kink in their schedule to take one picture of us. All in all the food, atmosphere, and the company triumphed the bad service and I would recommend this for a date night.",

Lobster bisque for appetizer was delicious the first taste but it's a little bit salty after a while. for the Maine lobster, the lobster was fresh and you get that buttery fresh flavor very delicious. We didn't feel that the wonton/dumpling was complimenting the dish though, also it's only 1/2 of the lobster and 1 claw worth of meat. I wouldn't mind paying a little bit more to get the whole lobster. Monk fish is just okay, we should've ordered the sea bass but gf wanted monk fish.",

    "text": "I sent my feedback to the restaurant right after our visit expecting a reply before I posted my review here. I have not heard any reply to date so my review is as follows: The presentation and taste of most of the food were acceptable. The goat cheese/olive oil dip served with the sourdough bread was delicious. The hummus and Non had an unusual \"burnt\" flavor but was palatable. The Pork Tenderloin was good but unremarkable. The menu indicated couscous as the side but the size of the grain was very large and the flavor and texture overwhelmed the main dish rather than complimenting it. The side of artichoke hearts was generous and prepared well. There is more food I could review, however, the ambiance and overall dining experience were the main reasons for dining here on this date and it failed terribly! When making the reservations earlier in the week, the 6 PM time slot was unavailable so I reserved the next opening at 6:45 PM. I requested the reservation with a window view for our 30-year anniversary celebration. However, upon arrival, I was told there would be no window seats available for another hour even though that is why I requested this reservation in this restaurant at that time. I explained this to the server and host, however, there was nothing that could be done so instead we were seated in the middle of the room! The room was at least quiet and conducive to a relaxing meal until..... a very large (more than 12 people) crowd was seated directly next to us! The din in the room became so loud it was impossible to have a conversation without yelling much less a pleasant digestive experience. We were also treated to an unrestrained child that kept running around our table with little supervision. No one seemed to take notice or reign him in. I realize many of these things can be expected when dining out at McDonald's or Wendy's. But if I am paying for food, wine, and ambiance for $150 - $200 for a special occasion and communicate my seating request in advance, I do not expect an experience I could get for $9.95 at Chuck-E- Cheese.  I am very disappointed in what was to be a landmark celebration for us by dining here.  Based on my experience and what I felt to be an apathetic attitude of the server and host I cannot recommend Different Pointe of View.",

    "text": "Wow.....wow, wow, wow WOW!!!! I made it back here less than two weeks after the Yelp Elite Event for a dinner with co-workers. If I come back here a million times, the view here will always leave me awestruck. There can't be a better place in The Valley to bring someone special to take their breath away. Since there were five of us and we love to share, we were able to sample a little of everything. We started with the scallops and duck ravioli. At the Yelp Elite Event I pretty much had a permanent spot at the scallop station so we all know how I feel about the scallops. The duck ravioli was delicious too. LOVED the appetizers.  I have to say that those of us who ordered the filet mignon for our main suffered severe buyer's remorse after my co-worker shared her venison with us. The venison was tender and smoky flavored and not at all gamy tasting. Served with sweet potatoes, I am KICKING myself for not ordering the venison. I do have issues with eating animals whom I classify as lovable and beautiful so venison, along with lamb and rabbit are usually off-limits. Had I known what the venison was going to taste like, I think I would have made an exception (FORGIVE ME, BAMBI!!)  My filet mignon with horseradish crust, was not bad but especially compared to the venison seemed a bit dull. That didn't stop me from eating all of it.  I have to give them props for the bread they served because it came with a choice of mushroom truffle herb butter, arugula pesto (which was AWESOME) and the THIRD spread, which for the life of me I CAN'T remember was awesome too.....it really was a toss up between the pesto and forgotten spread.  We also enjoyed some delicious cocktails and a great bottle of malbec, and later some desert. I can only vouch for my Tahitian Vanilla Creme Brulee which was a great way to finish our meal.  The service was impeccable, although my co-worker and I were both given the lobster bisque when we ordered salad. This is hardly a tragedy though because I got to enjoy the lobster bisque too.  Different Pointe of View is definitely a place you'd come only on a special occasion but it is, for this Yelper, one of the best fine dining options in The Valley. Just review the menu carefully and listen to your server....you don't want to be out-ordered!",

Anyway, while I did initially pick DPOV because of the view, I fell in love with the perfect service AND the perfect menu.  There were great options for my picky group, and not one person left unhappy, or hungry.  In addition, they seem to have a pre-fix menu with a nice price tag if you're ballin on a budget.    Everything was AMAZING and it's definitely one of my favorite restaurants in DC!",

Entrees run from $25-$39, and it's completely worth the cost, especially at sunset.  There is an expansive outdoor terrace if you need to be in the open air to take in the panorama from South Mountain to downtown to Squaw Peak and everything in between. After dark, the valley lights up like stars laid out on the desert floor.  The menu is American with some French, Latin and Native American influence. Don't pass up the scallops. They're amazing.  Halibut is also a great pick from the entrees. It was cooked perfectly and the portion size was almost enough to have leftovers.   The wine list is just gratuitous, but you can find some affordable and decent wines by the glass for under $10.  Service was attentive without hovering, and due to the dimly lighted atmosphere, the servers sometimes use a small flashlight when serving your courses and explaining what's on your plate.  Great for a romantic meal, a special occasion, or to bring your out of town guests for drinks and for the view.",

We ended up finding a beautiful table at the bar that is one floor lower when one of the hostesses came and got us and told us our table was ready. We left our table to go the restaurant, only to be seated inside even though we had specifically said we would wait for an outside table. When we asked the hostess again for an outside table, she said to leave the table and go to the lobby. When we got to the lobby, they said that if we wanted an outside table we should have put it on our reservation and now we can stand in line. We ended up leaving the restaurant and eating at the lounge one floor below. It has great service and beautiful views without the unwelcome ambiance of the restaurant.",

I wanted to take him to a restaurant with a view, and we were growing tired of the Downtown Phoenix/Scottsdale restaurants so I decided to try this place. The vibe of the place is very dressy, sophisticated, so come in your best dress. Reservations are flexible (I used OpenTable) and we were seated promptly near the window, with a gorgeous view of the city on a Friday night. If you have time, be sure to go to the Terrace Room for drinks, so you can have a cocktail and sit atop the hill and warm up next to the fire.   Once seated, our waiter was super courteous and funny, even the busboys were extremely gracious and polite. I never felt pressured to order anything (though they DO have a $9000 bottle of wine on the menu!) and was never intimidated by the atmosphere. We had focaccia bread the lobster bisque to start, and it was very impressive, be mindful that the texture is smooth, not chunky, and the flavors are very complex. We loved it. For entrees, I had the grilled endive and apple salad, which was surprisingly refreshing and not too sweet! The boyfriend had the duck breast and potato cakes, which had a perfect cook and looked just beautiful.   We finished by sharing a Birthday chocolate cupcake, which was cold but free :P As I think about it, I think the food was pricey mostly due to the location and the view, but I really can't say anything negative about the food, it was great. Take your loved one to this restaurant for great food and the experience. Definitely one of a kind in Arizona.",

    "text": "As Valley residents for over 30 years my wife and I have long been aware of the Different Pointe of View, but had never dined there.  We had been to Different Pointe in Time several times, but never \"up high.\"  For those who don't know, DPOV offers a nice view of downtown Phoenix along 7th St, especially during the winter and spring when the sun sets relatively early.  It perches high atop a mountain peak adjacent to the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs resort.  Bear this in mind because, while DPOV is often considered a great spot for special occasions for local residents, it is a resort and there is no apparent dress code in the restaurant.  The night we were there we observed patrons in flip-flops, shorts, T-shirts, and baseball caps worn backwards at the dinner table.  Not what you'd expect at a nicer restaurant, but it is a resort and these folks are on vacation and didn't feel like dressing up at the least.  This resort atmosphere may also explain why there are no table clothes here, just a wooden table.   Others here have commented on the drive to the top, the restaurant's atmosphere, etc.  Although many reviewers praised the service, we did not feel it was up to par.  The pace was extremely leisurely and at times very slow.  We waited over 10 minutes for our dessert, and the restaurant was not at all busy.  The pace was so slow that with a 6:30 pm reservation we didn't depart the restaurant until 8:45 pm. For appetizers my wife had the beef cheeks, which was fabulous.  Skimpy on the portion for $15.50, maybe 1.5 oz of meat, but what a delightful flavor.  I had the parmesan risotto with poached egg and black truffle for $13.95.  Again, just excellent.  Unfortunately, these dishes turned out to be the highlights of the evening. My wife had the poached pear butter lettuce salad with Humbolt Fog cheese, which we both love, candied almonds, and pomegranate seeds.  We both thought it was good, if a little skimpy for $14.00. For her entree my wife had the duck confit.   She loves duck and thought this was delicious.  I had a bite and it was good, if a little dry.  Now, for $36.00 you think you'd get more than a leg and a thigh, after all a duck is not a large bird, but that's all you get, maybe 3-4 oz. of protein, on a risotto bed.  If you have a big appetite I suggest you select another entree.  Local Christopher's and Crush Lounge's, at the Biltmore plaza, duck breast confit for about the same dollars is far superior. I accepted our waiter's pitch for the daily special of prawns, served on a black bean puree with squash pellets.  I know the difference between prawns, both biologically and size-wise, and what I got was just large shrimp, 5 pieces.  They were okay, a little overcooked, but they were not prawns.  For $38.00, I could have fed both of us a shrimp dinner at Red Lobster and there would have been little difference in taste.  .  I should have complained to him but he so rarely stopped by the table to follow up that it didn't seem worth the effort.  Plus, I didn't want to wait while another entree was prepared. For dessert my wife ordered the carrot cake, another major favorite.  The presentation was different because she didn't get a normal slice, but three half circles of a tubular carrot cake.  Again, for $9.50 we've had better.  The flavor was not overwhelming and the texture resembled fruit cake.  I recommend you try something else. Overall, I'd say the restaurant's emphasis is on plate presentations, which were outstanding, rather than food quality or quantity. With three glasses of wine and tip the bill was over $200.00.  I never mind a tab that large if the value and ambiance are there.  Neither of us felt they were and probably would not return.",

    "text": "Hotel restaurant.... Overpriced for mediocre food and terrible service; right? WRONG!!  We had gotten out and about while in Phoenix but finally decided to stay local and went to the Pointe which is on the top of the hill from the resort we stayed at The Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort.  We walked from our room, not for the faint of heart, and the grounds, and the building are beautiful, rocks, fountains, landscaping and all.  The third floor is where the main dining room is and as we past the second floor leading up we past a Christmas party which looked sheik, and I thought wow, that's a good sign if locals go here. The view is breathtaking and my pictures don't do it justice but their web site does. We were seated by the window and Corey took care of us along with an unnamed busser who was equally skilled.   We started with Blood Orange And Rocket Arugula Salad, and Roasted Butternut Squash Ravioli. Both Outstanding in the WOW category. We followed that up with:  Pan Seared Diver Scallops charred organic rainbow cauliflower, roasted sun chokes, black fermented garlic, apple basil evoo emulsion And: A filet Mignon that today I can't find on their site the way we had it. With mushrooms, and blue cheese. See picture.  We closed with: Classic Tahitian Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee lemon cooler cookie, fresh berries  and coffee  We were not rushed for an hour and half, and the service was perfect. There, pleasant and efficient as we needed and disappeared when we didn't.   It is pricy. What restaurant with outstanding view, ambience, service, and food isn't?",

I would recommend doing a reservation between 6:30 and 7:00 that seemed to have been the perfect time. We ordered the bass and pork tenderloin and both were amazing. Also had the goat cheese potatoes as our side (Ian let us substitute) and a side order of the gnocchi (which I'm still drooling over). Then for dessert we had this amazing cinnamon pudding sponge cake with ice cream and it was delicious! I will definitely be back and would definitely recommend this restaurant!",

My reason for not giving five stars is because the quality of the food just didn't WOW me. It was fancy, don't get me wrong, but the overall taste just didn't seem to match up for the price paid. I picked this restaurant over all others specifically based on the high reviews and apparent quality of food and I was hoping to be WOW'ed. I'll visit again but just for appetizers, which really WOW'ed me!",

    "text": "Finding the address is easy (just follow 7th Street), finding the restaurant a little trickier as you have to drive past the entrance to the hotel first and not be tempted to nab one of the open parking spots - you've got a ways to go yet. Keep ascending and eventually, when your car has almost given out on you, you'll find Different Point of View.   Valet was free and friendly. Up one flight of stairs and you'll find yourself in the bar. Up one more flight of stairs and you'll find the restaurant.  Decor is classy, but a little dated. Of course, not many people will be looking at the furniture when they see the view. A floor to ceiling glass window facing south, with downtown Phoenix in the distance. We were lucky enough to get one of the tables by the window as we had an earlier reservation (6:30) in order to see the sunset. There is a patio outside which would be a great location to sit and watch the sun go down, if only it wasn't 110 outside!  The wine list is very good, and expansive. There seems to be something for everyone, from multiple thousand dollar bottles of Premier Cru Bordeauxs to more affordable domestic wines. The only comment I would make is that there wasn't as much variety in the by-the-glass selection.  In addition the the regular menu, they offer a three course prix fixe deal for $40  - select the options that are printed in red and the selections were surprisingly good. The second prix fixe option is the Chef's choice seven course meal for $79pp with the option to add a wine pairing for an additional $29pp. The table next to ours had the Chef's choice and it seemed to be a great deal. We weren't that hungry and the OH wasn't drinking, so we chose the 3-course menu.  For apps the OH ordered the watermelon salad, which was good, but a little boring. A slice of seared watermelon and some mustard greens or rape. I ordered the lobster bisque and thought it was excellent, but would have liked to have seen some lobster meat instead of everything being pureed. It had a great flavour.  For entrees I had the daily addition, which tonight was Beef Short Ribs - delectable, melt in your mouth, amazing. She ordered the Trout which was perfectly cooked and served on a bed of shrimp and enoki mushrooms.  Dessert was Classic Tahitian Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee and Chocolate Turtle. They were both good, but the creme brulee was in a league of it's own. You can see why it is their signature dessert!  Service was very good and my water glass was never close to empty. Luis was our server and he told us he had worked there for 11 years, he said there were other servers who had worked there for much longer. His service was very professional, although a little pandering at times.  Summary - This is a great place for a date night. It's romantic, the service is good, the food very good and the view spectacular. You should go.",

When you are done with dinner, they have an outdoor firepit area that is truly incredible.  It's good for having an adult beverage and a good cigar if that is your thing.

    "text": "The restaurant created a very unwelcoming and negative experience. There was a waiter that was very snippy and curt that kept coming to my table. He spoke in a condescending manner towards the guests at my table. The rude attitude coming from restaurant staff set the pace for the whole evening experience.  The subpar service was so bad we had to swap waiters. It was a big disappointment for what could have been a nice evening.  Equally important, I ordered Hydroponic Bibb Lettuce Salad with baby tomatoes, crispy pancetta, toasted brioche croutons, sweet garlic parmesean dressing. I thought the salad portion was very skimpy and served on a large plate.  Next, I ordered The Chef's Daily Featured Dish which was a Grilled Halibut over a bed of Creamy Risotto and a small portion of Asparagus. I was more disappointed when I lifted my fork from the risotto and human hair came out. This is not what I should be finding in my food at an establishment like this. I ordered a Peanut Butter & Chocolate dessert. It had milk chocolate with peanut butter mousse, peanut butter carmel cream and butter honey ice cream.  I addressed the issues with management. The management spent a lot of time making excuses and arguing.  I ended up leaving the restaurant feeling very disappointed, dissatisfied and unhappy with the evening. It is a shame because the view of the city is unique.  However, the city view and dinner is not enjoyable or worth the expense if you end up getting the same type of dinning experience I had.  The food might look appealing but, it isn't very appetizing if you are going to be finding things in the food that should not be served in it.  Therefore, I find it difficult to recommend Different Pointe of View to others. The restaurant needs to work on creating a welcoming atmosphere that guests can enjoy.  Also, they need to improve the level of service provided for the premium price they are demanding.",

    "text": "My wife and I dined at the Different Pointe of View restaurant, located on the property of Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort, on Saturday evening July 23, 2016 AD. I apologize for the late review.  It was our first wedding anniversary and I wanted to pull-out all the stops! I wanted an elegant restaurant, fantastic cuisine, top-notch service and a view of the sunset and city lights that would memorialize the evening forever!  I +highly recommend+ this restaurant for anniversaries and other super-special occasions! You will want to dress-to-the-nines - bare minimum would be a suit, collared shirt or vest with tie and slacks.  Be sure to book reservations as far in advance as you can! They have valet parking so be sure to bring some cash for the tip. Valet is the only way to go for a night like this! Bring a decent camera - the valet should offer to take a photo of you and your party next to a beautiful fountain as you enter. Gorgeous!  The hostess told me when I booked the reservation that she couldn't guarantee a window seat, but that I could arrive 30 minutes early, check-in and they could work on a window seat then. That is exactly what we did and only had to wait 10 minutes. IT WAS WORTH IT! I also told the hostess when I made the reservation, that it was our first wedding anniversary and requested any special treatment they offered. When we arrived at our table, we had two glasses of champagne to greet us! Perfect!  Our server was awesome and the food was spectacular! It is a 5-star restaurant with 5-star pricing. It was well worth it and we will be back in the future to celebrate special events with our family!  After dinner we walked to the Terrace Room lounge, one level below the Different Pointe of View restaurant, and went outside to look at the city lights. The lounge is nice and would be a great place to relax before or after dinner.  The hostess and staff of the Different Pointe of View restaurant could not have been better! I will proudly recommend this establishment to all of my family and friends! Keep up the great work! Thank you for making our first wedding anniversary truly memorable!  A solid 5-stars!",

    "text": "I was here to celebrate my birthday last night. After choosing between Durants and a Different Point of View, I cannot be more happier to have chosen this place in the end. The atmosphere was as beautiful as I last remembered it. The amazing view from our dining table remains unchanged. I cannot think of a better place to end a perfect evening with friends.  Last time I was here was over 3 years ago. Their menus (especially the dessert) have changed a lot since then. They currently offer a summer pre-fix menu (appetizer, main entree and dessert) for only $39.95. Normally, a single dish alone already cost just as much. If budget allows, I highly recommend you to come here before this special ends. Since I didn't see anything that caught my attention (until I tried my friend's dishes after the fact), I've decided to order it from the regular menu last night. For my main course, I had the Roasted Duck and a Classic Tahitian Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee for dessert. Roasted Duck was a bit dry for my taste. Overall, it was still tasty. My dessert had just the right amount of sweet and it was beautifully decorated.   All of my friends ordered 3 courses prefix menu. I was able to try a little bit of everything (benefit of having foodie friends). I wish I would have ordered the Seared Stone Fish instead. The portion was generous and delicious. My other friend was a bit disappointed at the Shrimp Ravioli (Basil Pesto, Summer Greens, Garlic Chips, Sweet Corn Reduction). It was tasty, but it only had a tiny bit of shrimp in it. My second choice in dessert would be the Peanut Butter & Chocolate (Milk Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse, Honey Caramel, Cocoa Peanuts, Caramelized Banana Ice Cream).   All dishes were beautifully decorated; atmosphere is amazing and service was outstanding. Which is why a Different Point of View has earned a 5 star review from me. I will definitely come back here again on special occasion. Be aware when you are driving up to the restaurant. The road is narrowed and parking is a bit hectic. Valet is available. Even though formal attire isn't required, I highly recommend it :)   P.S. Reservation can be made through \"Open Table\" and here is the link for their summer prefix menu: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tapatiocliffshilton.com%2Finteractive%2Fpdf%2F1467329535.46Summer%2520Prix-Fixe%2520only%2520for%2520resort%2520web%2520page.pdf&s=a5b313774497d513df9f11b21f1596c5a2c88d499d57efbb2f0ce6492209c013\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tapatiocliffshilton.com/...</a>",

My fiance thought it was the best view from a restaurant he has seen so far!   Service was spectacular - first course, Buttermilk Fried Soft Shell Crab Honey Sweet Corn Polenta, Asparagus Puree, Piquillo Pepper Emulsion. It was a whole small crab and I ate that thing like it was no one's business!  Second course - Seared Blue Nose Sea Bass Crispy Saffron Parmesan Risotto Cake, Rapini, Peppadew Pepper Reduction. My oh my! It was so deliciously scrumptious!  Third course - Peanut butter cheesecake was so damn yummy! It was a good ending to a great meal! We went outside right after the dinner on to the patio and the view is breathtaking!   Even with restaurant week prices, you do spend more than $50/pp with tax, wine, and tip...but it was worth it!",

This definitely is an awesome spot to take someone for their birthday, anniversary, or any special occasion. The view is definitely a part of the experience and a gorgeous place to catch the sunset. The staff was very gracious and courteous from the moment I stepped in.  Since we came at 6PM right at opening, we got one of the prime tables inside facing the view! The staff were so accommodating and took pictures for us before we had our dinner. We both wanted to try out the summer prix-fixe menu ($39.95) which included an appetizer, entree, and dessert. My gf got the mirin & lime seared ahi tuna salad, day boat California bass, and peanut butter/chocolate mousse. I got their famous lobster bisque (which has been a staple for 30+ years and made from real lobster), porcini crusted pork tenderloin, and stone fruit clafouti. Since we both love food, we shared everything. The ahi tuna and California bass were fresh and delicious considering the fish was obviously not from Arizona. The lobster bisque was very rich and smooth, but I was slightly disappointed that there were no lobster chunks in the bisque. The pork tenderloin was quite dry and I only had a little piece in the restaurant so I could take the rest home to recook with more moisture and marinade which actually tasted better the next day. The peanut butter chocolate mouse was decadent and tasty! Finally the clafouti. I actually had no idea what it was and was told it was like a cobbler. It tasted more like a soggy piece of floppy pie so I do not recommend it!   Overall, the food was pretty decent depending on what you ordered, but the view was impeccable!",

Note that all the window view tables seem to be 4-tops so large parties will probably be seated more towards the center or the other side of the restaurant.  They are currently running a prix-fixe summer special. For $39.95 you get your choice of starter, entree, and dessert. The choices were varied enough that we could choose from the prix-fixe menu and be satisfied with our selections. I had the lobster bisque, stone fish, and ended the meal with a strawberry shortcake. I also sampled some of the short rib, bistro steak, and duck (Regular menu item).   We started our meal with some complimentary bread and a selection of maple pepper compound butter, pepper sauce, and goat cheese spread. The goat cheese spread and the pepper sauce were excellent but I couldn't taste too much of the maple or pepper flavor in the compound butter.   The lobster bisque was rich, creamy smooth, with a concentrated lobster flavor. It was superb.  The stone fish entree was a True delight. The fish had an even crispy sear on it with perfect tender succulent meat. It was perched on top of rice, mushrooms, shrimp, and onion. The colors, textures, and flavors meshed well with the delicate taste of the fish. The only negative was that the lobster soy mushroom broth was too salty for my tastes. The other dishes I tried were cooked to perfection.  Dessert was a delightful \"tres\" strawberry cake, with a trio of macerated strawberries and rhubarb, strawberry cheesecake ice cream, and strawberry sauce. We had an additional complimentary set of rich, luxurious chocolates with toffee(?) pieces in them.   Service was impeccable. Thanks to Darren for helping to make our night wonderful!  The restaurant can be a little difficult to get to, since it's so high up the mountain and a lot of the road here is one way, steep, and narrow so drive with caution (Especially with all the touristy folk driving about). You have the option of valet or self-park.  One thing to note ladies: This is not a heel friendly venue, so walk with caution or prepare your footwear accordingly. The walkway, although beautifully designed, is made of natural rough stones which make for an uneven walking surface. Once you reach the restaurant you'll have a slightly steep flight of stairs to walk up before you meet the host/hostess.  Overall 4.5/5.",

Unfortunately our service was really disappointing. Perhaps he was having a bad day, but our server barely spoke to us. I told him I couldn't decide between 2 dishes, and instead of giving me more detail about each, or sharing with me his favorite, he said, \"Its up to you.\" Our server was very slow to the table, and rarely came back to check on us at all. We were never asked how the meal was, or if we wanted another drink. We had to flag our waiter down to get another glass. Our food was okay, the Scallops, while a very generous portion, were pretty salty and the pork tenderloin was average at best.Perhaps this is a good place to get a cocktail in the bar, but I'd skip the dinner.",

I made a reservation about a month in advance, we were seated inside right at a window with a stunning view. This the best place to see a Phoenix sunset.   We had the mussels to start and they were very tasty (so was the complimentary bread with various spreads!).  I had the filet mignon and it was sooooo tender.  Very well flavoured and a nice portion size.  The grits it came with seemed a little salty to me at first but once I put some on the filet, it was a perfect match!  My mom ordered the other cut of steak. It was extremely flavourful, she found it to be a bit tough of a cut for her liking but she enjoyed it. The potato galette that came with her meal was phenomenal too!  We order a side of veggies and decided we could have done without them.  The entrees came with enough food themselves. We also found the veggies to be a bit mushy and had an odd seasoning on them that we could have done without.  This didn't take away from the amazing meal at all, we just thought we could skip it in the future.   The view is to die for! It is definitely worth seeing.  We will be back next year!",

    "text": "A Different Pointe of View is a different type of place. This isn't the typical hotel restaurant serving burgers or the average steak. A Different Pointe of View is very... very different. As you follow the narrow, winding ave up the steep climb to this 'pointe of view', you sort of wonder where you are headed. The valet finally greets you as you find that perched atop a high pointe is a lone building known as A Different Pointe of View. Inside the building is full of grandeur. We did not have a table on the glass and at first I was a little disappointed but we had an elevated table and you could see the city lights below from every table, it seemed. The wine list is ample but I felt there should be more French Champagnes and California sparkling wines by the split or glass for a place of this caliber because there are only two. The menu is amazing though; there is a chef's special too. Tonight it was a venison with a citrus cranberry finish. I ordered the Duck with Salate Ricotta Ravioli and started with the Lobster Bisque. Other menu items at our table were the Porcini Encrusted Pork Tenderloin with Goat Cheese Risotto and the Chef's Special for this night : The Venison recommended with a medium rare on temp. We started with bubbly and then a fabulous Pinot Noir to pair with our festive meal. The bread that was placed on the table was TO DIE FOR! It comes with three butter/sauces: a basil cilantro ; a strawberry butter; and a parmesan dipping sauce. But honestly, I loved this bread all on its own. The bisque was also amazing. Could have been my entire meal! A sweet start with a tad bit of a tang on the finish. Take a piece of that amazing bread and dip it into the bisque ... it's okay that it's a 4 Diamond restaurant.. NO one will notice! The main course arrives and clearly the chef is all about his presentation! This meal looks like art on a plate! My roasted duck is perched on charred cauliflower with three stuffed ravioli. At first one may think they aren't going to have enough to eat.. You will. The food is rich and delicious! The duck was the right amount of crisp and yet still juicy. Shredded duck was inside the ravioli which surprised me! Perfect palate gift with the ricotta and pillow of ravioli. My husband's venison was perfect and not a bit of game taste. The fruits complimented this dish well. Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable with wine pairings to meal and a perfect humor. The dessert menu looked heavenly but, we had no room for dessert but macaroons arrive when your meal is complete. There is a tasting menu for $89 that I can not wait to come back and take part of. I also know that next time, I will come at dusk and request a table on the glass to take in all the beauty of this place that sits atop the city and perched upon a mountainous rock! A Different Pointe of View is different and it's lovely in all of its fanciful ways. This is a perfect date night spot or special occasion place that's worth every single cent. My pointe of view is that this is a 5:)",

    "text": "For upscale dining with arguably the most spectacular views in the Phoenix area, make sure you dine at Different Pointe of View! From the italian architecture that greets you at the entrance way to the open air patio with fountains and fire pits, you won't be disappointed!  My companions and I dined inside with a panoramic view of the surrounding mountain peaks with the city lights sparkling below. For appetizers we had Chef's Fresh Hummus of the Day Shrimp Ravioli, Lobster Bisque, Chopped Romaine Salad, and Seared Berkshire Pork Belly.  The ravioli was savory and fragrant. Eat it in tiny bites to squeeze out every bit of sumptuous flavor. The pork belly was the absolute best I have ever had and beats out any restaurant's preparation of it in my lifetime (no kidding). The pork belly was a generous 1.25 inch cut and so tender that it nearly melted in my mouth. Seasoned and cooked to perfection, it was a completely satisfying combination with the mashed potato and mushroom reduction.  The lobster bisque maintained a delightful creaminess while being so thick that it did not drip off my spoon. It has a deep, smoky quality that I've never experienced with a lobster bisque in any other restaurant. If you've had lobster bisque before and either thought it was good, or have been disappointed, come here for THIS lobster bisque, which can outperform or redeem any experience you've had before.  My companions had the Seared Diver Scallops for a main course and I had the Aleppo Seared Ahi from the starter menu. How many ways can I say \"never had anything so good in my life?\" The tuna was just spicy enough to bring warmth without overpowering the more delicate tuna flavor, the Amaranth, Cilantro, Cucumber, Lemon patty on the plate was a mouthful of fresh, cool, and a perfect counterpart to the spicy tuna. The Roasted Jalapeno Avocado Puree tied the spicier tuna and the cool and refreshing vegetable and herb patty together with savory creaminess.  While we were dining, sun set and the lights of Phoenix below provided a spectacular backdrop. Be sure to stay for cocktails or a bottle of wine with friends on the outdoor patio on one of the elevated seating areas, or settle by a roaring fire pit. On warmer nights, sit near the cliffside fountain where the burbling water will make you feel cool despite the desert heat.  Our taste ambassador, Cory, was amazing. I cannot call him a server or waiter - he was an exceptional ambassador to the wines as well as the menu offerings. The Executive Chef, Anthony DeMuro, even came out to our table to greet us. The old saying is \"never trust a skinny chef.\" Trust THIS one! From this culinary experience at Different Point of View, I feel spoiled and have a sense that I'll need to let the memories of this restaurant fade before I can enjoy another.",

Reservations were at 7:00 p.m. Saturday. The restaurant was a little hard to find, but once we found it, there was a sign \"valet parking ONLY.\" As we walked up the stairs there was clearly a wedding going on and that is why I suppose \"Valet Parking ONLY\".  While the view was spectacular the restaurant was an outdated \"older\" clientele restaurant. Our server Lenny was very good, the table we had was on the 2nd tier with a view. We ordered Lobster Bisque with (Lemon Zest Creme), the Rosemary Scented Duck Confit Raviolis with (Creamed Corn, Piquillo Pepper Pesto, English Pea Puree, Grated Ricotta Salata, Sauteed Rapini) and the Seared Aleppo Chili Crusted Pork Tenderloin with (Crispy Honey Sweet White Corn Polenta, Baby Summer Squash, Black Bean Parmesan Puree, Jalapeno Honey Glaze).    The Lobster Bisque was good. The Raviolis were so salty I had to send back. The pork was was also salty but not overwhelming and by the time I got my new Raviolis my dining partner was 3/4 finished, so I ate one and took the rest home. Do I think this is a 5 star restaurant? Sorry No.   ... And to top it off when we went to pick up our car at the \"Valet ONLY\" because of a wedding, my dining partner tipped the guy when he delivered the car. Obviously the valet guy was not happy with the tip and muttered under his breath so it could be heard.  View SPECTACULAR, service very good, food OK, and valet obnoxious",

It's at the top of the Pointe Hilton at Tapatillo Cliffs with an impressive view of the entire Phoenix skyline at night. There is truly no restaurant in the city with a better view. It's dark and romantic, also with a patio outside. The patio has several fireplaces and tiki torches, adding to the ambiance at night.  Service was amazing. The waiter knew every detail of the menu and offered great suggestions. He paced the meal incredibly well, and was attentive St not intrusive. This is the mark of an excellent waiter.  They start you with homemade focaccia and ciabatta bread, accompanied with maple butter, pepper pesto, and a goat cheese emulsion. Each of the three spreads were amazing. I could be happy with a few baskets of bread and call it a night.  For appetizers, the oysters were served with horseradish and bacon. Unlike a lot of heavy oyster dishes, it was light and refreshing. The other appetizer was a pork belly risotto with a poached egg and black truffles. Probably one of the best appetizers I've had in my life. And I order black truffles everywhere, so I can say that this was one of the best truffle dishes!  The entrees were lamb loin and duck risotto. One of the most tender pieces of duck I've seen. It could be cut with a fork. The lamb was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  Overall, excellent food and views.",

The view was incredible and the great weather made it a spectacular evening to sit out on the patio. Unfortunately, the food and the service were not as great as the atmosphere. We asked to switch our table to an outdoor patio table since the restaurant was very slow. After thirty minutes of no acknowledgement we made the request again. I will say that during the wait we were very polite and patient as to not ruin the mood of the evening.  Eventually the manager did approach and agreed to relocate us but seemed very bothered. He made no apologies for wait or the lack of acknowledgement. My husband and I both noticed that he did not smile once during his communication with us, he couldn't even fake a smile when I thanked him for helping us. As mentioned the view was beautiful and we and we anxiously awaited our dinners. I ordered a Scallop dish that was delicious. My husband ordered the Filet, medium rare. Unfortunately his filet was well done when he received it. Our waiter did offer to bring out a new filet but we have never feel comfortable sending food back so he ate it. We also ordered a side of Artichokes that were flavorless and tough. Overall, I would recommend the restaurant for the view. Your food may be hit or miss. And the service can definitely be improved.",

I mean I was spoiled living in Los Angeles and traveling, but it is what it is... So, friends and I decided to go to DPOV for dinner tonight to celebrate my son turning 13, and even though I heard it was ridiculously overpriced, I thought sure why not... He is turning 13. So like any gay dad would do, I made a reservation, and it was quite wonderful. From the moment we walked in everyone greeted him with a happy birthday.  The food: Yes, while it is overpriced... It is spectacular... between all of us eating we had: Bistro Tomato Infused Steak (my choice, which was amazing , beyond amazing and delicate), Duck Confit (probably the best, but apparently everyone at the table thought my risotto was better), Coriander Lamb (the mustard sauce was great, the couscous was okay), Basil Chicken (sauce was amazing), Lobster Bisque (extremely layered and wonderful), Peanut Butter Chocolate Moose, and the Mocha Espresso (pretty amazing and rich), and coffees. (I had a double espresso that was thick and wonderful)....   The Service: It was beyond exceptional, and patient as two of our party got lost and we took up the table for quite some time.  Ambiance: Gorgeous, the track lighting really does showcase the food and creates an intimate environment. It definitely is a great getaway for a date or romantic fling as it is attached to the resort.  Overall it was a pretty beautiful evening.",

It was good but this is exactly how it tastes at home (ok I make good salad)   I can imagine this to be a great place for someone who wants to rest after a stressful day and watch the city lights from a place tucked away on a mountain - and doesn't mind spending minimum $65 per person.  Maybe it is a good idea to check if the pork, or any meat is grass fed - which would justify the price, or are the prices justified by elevation of the restaurant - which, at least for me, is not worth it.",

    "text": "Priir to visiting Different Point of View... i made the mistake of reading too many negative reviews/comments.  This place was an exceptional dining experience.  First, the view is amazing.  You need a shuttle to get to the top of the mountain from the hotel property.  There is a bar downstaits from the dining area where you can have a drink inside or out. Outside has an amazing patio (1/5th of iy can be seen in my picture) which overlooks pheonix.  While having drinks, i noticed they were underpoured SEVERELY and cost $14 each.  After several.. I was begining to get annoyed by the size and made a commeent to the waiter.  He apologized and gave me an additonal Macallan on the rocks on him.  So although yhe drinks were severely underpoured, an attempt was made to please me.  The food ordered to the table: CHOPPED SALAD LOBSTER BISQUE SAUSAGE RAVIOLI DUCK SPECIAL SHORT RIB (BONELESS) VANILLA BEAN ICE CREAM  The lobster bisque was very very tasty and the other person in my party enjoyed his salad.  We split the ravioli appetizer which consists of 3 raviolis but we each received 2.  They had broccoli rabe sausage and a nice filling.  I forgot to mention the two types of bread for the table came with a selection of 3 amazing spreads:: blood orange butter, pesto, goat cheese reduction.  The duck was a great taste but I ordered the short rib and only \"tried\" th e duck.  The short rib was a tiny bit overcooked but i am mentioning it for the sake of being accurate... it wasnt bad and didnt take away from how good it was.  The polenta and veg inckuded underneth the shortrib also had a great taste.  It's important to note, 4 scotches (one complimentry), 2 bourbons and an additional 2 orders of ice cream were added to the bill before seeing $187.50.  To dome this may dound a bit much, but I dont believe those people travel to New York.  Furthermore, I understand price should be relative to the geo location and I still dont believe it was OVERLY excessive.  This place is great for those who want a mountaintop dining and drinking experience with high quality food.  My trip consisted of visits to Tomasos, The Mission, & Different Pointe of View.  Different Pointe of View would come in second to Tomasos.. but just because I am italian and love pasta :-)   If I am to be in PHX again, it will be a must gor me to visit Different Pointe of View again.... wiyhe the misses most likely.",

The service was poor and our waiter was just awkward (oh and he had horrible breath).  The food was ok but not great. For a restaurant that charges the high end prices I expect high end service & high quality food. My girlfriend and I both ordered the filet and they were both slightly over cooked but not enough to send them back. It was my girlfriends birthday so they were nice enough to bring out a free dessert but they should have asked me if it was something we liked first because it was not. I would have rather paid for a dessert that we both enjoyed.  So in summary, the view is A+ along with a romantic setting, food below average for what i expect & service was poor.",

    "text": "As romantic as it can get. I have now eaten here several times and cannot believe I have never completed a review. Let me first say that this is what all upscale restaurants should inspire to be. If you are looking for a romantic place to take your sweetheart you can do no better. This is the first place that my wife said she loved me. Need I say more... Come before dark and watch as the city comes alive before you with the twinkly lights of the Phoenix city center. Located high up on top of a hill inside the Pointe resort even the drive to the top will inspire you to what you are about to experience. The ambiance and arrangement of tables makes for a very upscale dining experience.  Service is superior and they are obviously professionally trained and coached. We were greeted by reception by name and felt served from the very start. Never can I remember in all the times I have been here that I was interrupted mid sentence. So many places we have gone where the server just walks right up and starts talking. I find this rude and happily I have found the Pointe of View to not be lacking in class. They are there just as you begin to think you need them.   Their wine list is very extensive and their servers are very qualified in wine pairing to your meal. One of the only places I would ask them to recommend the wine for the dish. I am certain they know all the ins and out of every dish and can perfectly match to your taste preferences.  Well if anyone has ever been they know now what I am going to say. The Lobster Bisque is the best I have ever had anywhere in the world. We have gone many times just to enjoy this dish and a salad with a nice glass of wine and the best view in Phoenix. We have tried their menu extensively and have never been disappointed. I will not name here as you can examine their menu online and all their dishes are superior. Never will you feel rushed to clear a table and never will you feel ignored. My my as I write this I think I am going tonight! This is number one on my restaurant list in Phoenix and the surrounding Metro area. A little pricey so maybe you not somewhere you would go often but always go here for a special romantic occasion.  Kurt G",

He and I came here at around 4 on a Sunday and had our choice of tables on the patio, there was only one or two the tables occupied. If you can, you simply MUST sit along the railing outside. You are treated to a beautifully unobstructed view of the valley and mountains in the distance.   Overall we had a really lovely time and would definitely return. However. The service left something to be desired. The girl taking care of our table was very sweet but seemed extremely unsure of herself and made things a bit uncomfortable. She didn't know much about the wine list (granted, it is huge, but still) and was awkward opening the bottle we selected. The cork ended up being rotted so we were able to get a new bottle which a gentleman opened for us. He was much more sure of himself and made us feel more at ease.   By around 6:30 it started to fill up outside, so be aware of when you get here to pick out the best table.   Cheers!",

    "text": "What a view and exquisite meal with spot-on service!  We had reservations on a Sunday evening for dinner.  The host was friendly and made small talk as they opened.  Our server, Luis, was excellent.  He offered to take pictures of us outside while our food was being prepared.  He had quite the sense of humor too!  Luis knew every aspect of the menu and was helpful when one of us was stuck between choosing certain entrees or drinks.  I started off with the Winter Sunset for a beverage.  I can't specifically recall its contents, but grenadine, fennel syrup, and I believe tequila were in it.  It was fruity and left a nice taste different than the upcoming savory entree. The bread service had three different types of bread including olive bread, served with lemon butter, a gorgonzola cream-like spread, and a tomato based spread as well.  The bread is not warm though.  They could improve in this area.  An olive oil with Mediterranean herbs would have been a nice option in the trio.  Luis also brought out a small shot glass like container for each of us to sample their lobster bisque.  WOW!  It is heavier and very creamy.  I kind of wished I had ordered it as an appetizer.  In my past DPOV visits, there is always something to sample which is a nice touch. I had the Tomato Grilled Bistro Steak for my entree.  The beef was cooked to my liking (medium rare).  In my opinion, the charred rainbow cauliflower made the dish!  Everything on the plate came together when combined in one bite...just wonderful!  For dessert, I had the Chocolate and Citrus Espresso: \"Caramel Chocolate Mousse, Cinnamon Orange Espresso Cream, Sherry Sabayon.\"  It was AMAZING!  One of the best desserts I've had in a long time.  The mousse was velvety and had a rich flavor.  The espresso cream complimented the dish well too.  It was absolutely exquisite.  In my opinion, DPOV is not too expensive for what you get too.  I have spent far more money at a sub-par steakhouse.  My entree was $32 and dessert was $9.25.  On top of the fair prices, just look outside; there are not too many places in which you take in these kinds of views!",

I had the pork tenderloin entree. The brie risotto was different (a bit pungent), but good. There are minimal vegetarian options, so my friend ended up getting the three side combination with Sauteed Parmesan & Herb Gnocchi and the Seasonal Fresh Vegetables; which she enjoyed. For dessert we shared the Classic Tahitian Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee. It came with fresh blackberries, and was delicious. As others mentioned, it came with a bleu cheese cookie, which was unique and different but tasty and worth trying (although my friend did not care for it). For drinks, I had a glass of the Hahn Pinot Noir, which was delicious and I highly recommend trying it. My friend had the chocolate martini, which she remarked was standard.   The main reason I'm taking off a star is because the service, while polite and cordial, it felt like they were trying to rush us out the door. Our reservation for dinner was at 9:30 on a Saturday night, and I don't think we were taking a long time, though the restaurant basically cleared out by 10. So the ambiance also lacked a bit in that way. Make reservations---you may not need them, but there might be an event that makes it harder to get a table (as we discovered). There's a lounge downstairs that also has the beautiful view that serves appetizers.",

    "text": "I'm on a positive yelp review writing kick because I'm in a good mood, so I thought I'd share this experience with Different Pointe of View.   My boyfriend and I came here right before we saw Louis CK perform at the Celebrity Theater. In making the reservation, he had casually mentioned this.   We show up to the restaurant, and first of all, I was really blown away with where this place is located. It has a beautiful view overlooking Phoenix and it's tucked away in a mountain side or something.   The hostess was incredibly sweet and greeted us and for some weird reason knew who we were right when we walked in. We were sat right away and everyone who came to our table were charming and polite.   We started with the butternut squash ravioli, seared scallops, and the lobster bisque. Oh my goodness. I can't even begin to explain, there was such complexity in the flavors, it was very good.   My boyfriend got the Artichoke pesto chicken and I got the trout. Again, I cannot begin to explain how delicious our meal was. The flavors all melded so well together. My dish came with mushrooms and I completely cleaned my plate. I despise mushrooms! But these were really something else. We skipped dessert, but the table next to us as we were leaving made us regret that decision because it looked incredible. The bill was pretty up there, but, what is to be expected from a place like this? The view, service and food; it all somewhat felt worth it to me.  Upon leaving, the hostess not only remembered who we were but also told us to have a great time at the show. I know it's her job as a hostess to be inviting, but I feel that's something that takes a little more effort to do, and it was greatly appreciated and really made the dinner feel that much better.   This is a wonderful date night restaurant. My boyfriend and I both agreed if we ever find ourselves in Phoenix again, we will definitely come back to this place.",

Coming from the parking lot, we were a little confused about where to go, but our deductive reasoning told us to take the elevator up to the top level.  From then on, everything was easy. Spectacular service.  My hubs had informed them it was our anniversary upon making the reservation, and after checking in they offered us a Congratulations. We were ushered to our table, one with a premium view. The sommelier offered suggestions for wine and our server was extremely well versed in the menu.  The manager overheard me expressing concerns about the venison dish and offered more information.  My husband ended up ordering that dish and LOVED it.  We finished everything off with their famous creme brulee.   We were very impressed with both our food and our service, and will definitely come back for another special occasion dinner.",

But having said that, this place is phenomenal. A perfect date place to make an impression and here's why:  Ambiance:  The view is gorgeous.  At sunset, you can watch the sun go down over the city while surrounded by small bonfires on the patio.  It is beautiful, and once the sun has set, you can relax outside watching the beautiful stars against the dark sky and local hills/mountains.  Seriously can't be beat.  Food:  Excellent quality.  Started with a delicious salad, followed up with a absolutely tender salmon and medium steak over some buttery scalloped potatoes that was designed to be art on a plate, and finally finished with a vanilla bean creme brulee that was just crisp on top (that nice crackle of sugar) and a smooth vanilla flavor throughout afterwards.  Seriously, between the food and view, this is a great place.  I only withhold a star because I have no idea relative to the value/pricing of the place.  Verdict:  I'd love to bring the wife here in the future for a meal and view!  Hoping to come back soon!",

I had the scallops, 5 large scallops and the fixings, left full.  The salads were also great.  The wine list is interesting and would have whatever you need.  I'm not sure why I'm not giving it 5 stars but it certainly deserves the 4 I'm giving it.  Probably because of the price, you pay for the view.",

    "text": "Made an Open Table reservation that apparently didn't make it in.  Luckily they had a spot for us on the terrace but I kind of wonder if they just wanted us to appreciate the view..  Good view, but a little annoyed at passing a half empty air conditioned room to get to our table.  The ironic thing is we probably would have chosen to sit outside if given a choice.  The bread came with a pesto, some kind of dip and a raspberry butter(?).  Nothing outstanding although I did enjoy the pesto.  Maybe if the bread was warmed a bit it would have been better.  The lobster bisque was very good.  Didn't taste too fishy but had a nice full lobster flavor.  Liked the touch of creamed corn.    We both got the halibut as our entree.  It was good, but I wouldn't say outstanding.  None of the parts were awesome and together they were just ok.  Presentation was lovely..   For desert I got the upside cake.  The coconut sorbet (?) was good, the cake was passable and the cut fruit didn't add or detract much from the dish.  I was kind of disappointed because the place had such great ratings.  The view was nice and the drive up was exciting.  But the dinner was anticlimatic that climaxed at the bisque.",

Yes the view was top notch. But not only did the host belittle us as she walked us back to the table in the very corner of the room but she said typically it's not a restaurant for young people. Our waiter completely ignored us as he served cocktails numerous times to the surrounding tables as he sent someone over to check and see if we'd like dessert. We didn't see him once during our main course to check in or grab us another drink. Disappointed with the service to say the least. And I feel sorry for anyone who has to experience the same that we did.",

    "text": "I took my mother here last night for Christmas Eve dinner and let me tell you this place is AMAZING!!! It's a climb straight up 1800 feet to a beautiful view of the city! Usually places with a view like this rest on their laurels in terms of the food and service (see my review of Rustler's Roost) but this was incredible! We arrived a tad late and were greeted by a very professional Host who may have been one of the managers. The dining room is tiered so there are no tables without a view. Obviously the closer to the window is slightly better but i don't think any of the tables will disappoint. We started with a cocktail and we shared the lobster bisque (the absolute BEST I have ever tasted) and the pork belly which was also delightfully decadent! Mom chose the pork tenderloin which was perfectly cooked medium well and served on a walnut bread with turnips, brussels sprouts with parsnip puree and a wonderful BBQ sauce with chopped apples. Delish! I had the strip loin rare and it was melt in your mouth perfect, served with some veg I don't recall because I was so blown away at the incredible wood grilled flavor the meat had. Arguable the best steak I have ever been served in a restaurant.  Basically I would've gone into the kitchen and done a slow clap for the crew but I didn't want to risk being put to work in the dish pit! Our server had just been awarded a 30 year pin for his long service and I can see why they have kept him on so long: he was polite, informative about the menus but not at all trying to up sell which I appreciate. He wasn't overly attentive which is a quality I find irritating, being over serviced is almost worse than under. All in all a True pro and would love to be seated in his section when my wife and I dine there. We shared the creme brulee which was the only dish that was just good but not great. The crust was perfect but the custard was too firm and not quite sweet enough. It tasted like creme brulee one might be served at Rustler's Roost. Not bad, just not quite up to par on the rest of the food. But still, we left completely satisfied, and have been gushing to our family members on the phone today (being Christmas Day) about the wonderful experience we had. I am so glad I finally made to this place and will definitely be going again soon!",

However, the food (Chef) has really changed our experience.  The last two times we dined, we did not enjoy it as much as we usually do.  Last night I had the scallops, perfectly cooked but I had so much going on my plate my taste buds were confused.  The sauce that came with the okra was extremely strong flavored as well as the olive tapenade on top of the scallops.  Bacon does not always go on everything.  I had to scrape all the topping off my scallops to actually taste them.  The dessert was ordinary and dry.  Loved the staff.",

Food was beautifully prepared and the kitchen was sharp enough to split our appetizers between two plates for my wife and I (nice touch).  We ordered the scallops and a salad for appetizers.  We ordered the Filet Mignon and the Venison dishes for entrees, both were excellent.  Place loses a star for the service.  The host and the reservation people were very accommodating, even with a last minute change in plans.  However, our server was slow and not very attentive.  The bus staff was prompt to clean plates and refill drinks, but server was slow with food and extra slow for drinks.  would have likely ordered a couple more drinks, if he had kept them coming at a good pace.

    "text": "I have put this one off because in my three visits to this restaurant I have had widely diverse experiences.  (See Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort for my hotel review.) The primary differences between my experiences at the restaurant seem to center around the volume of people and the time of year you go.  The service AND food were much better during off-peak season.  Phoenix is a very seasonal city and the restaurants and hotels are sometimes overwhelmed when peak season hits in February.  First of all, yes, come for the view.  And if you want fancy, this is where you go for fancy.  So don't get all worked up because they don't have a ribeye or burgers.  You are mostly paying for the view and the ambiance, and both are wonderful.  If weather permits, ask for an outside table when you call for a reservation.    Second, prepare for the expense.  Dinner is about $29-$45 just for your entree, and the wine, while excellent, is commensurate with the food prices.    I have had the lobster bisque, which is out of this world, and the pan-seared diver scallops, which were average, as appetizers.   The lobster bisque is, of course, really super rich and fattening, and even though I wanted to slurp the whole thing down (which would be frowned upon in a place this upscale) I controlled myself, but I still felt like I was going to pop by the time dinner came.  Maybe share one with a friend.  (It was worth the popping feeling.)  At my first two visits here, the bread came out early and was delicious.  At the last visit, I had to ask for it three times and just gave up when it still wasn't there when my entree arrived.  The three sauces they bring with it are all yummy (again, fattening).  In my continuing quest to reacquaint myself with my hip bones, have tried three of the four salads, including the hierloom tomato carpaccio (tasty and light but nothing out of this world), the crisp apple and micro herbs (much more interesting and really delicious), and the blood orange and rocket arugula (very tasty and interesting).  Salads will run you from $11-$13.  At $43, the filet mignon was probably the tastiest entree I have had there, and it was well prepared and had cooked to my picky little specifications.  One time I had the Chef's feature, which was sea bass and was delicious.  I tasted friend's plates and the pork tenderloin was really quite good.  Another friend has the osso bucco and said it was good, but I really wouldn't know as I don't eat baby lambs.     I have had the scallops as an entree and found them to be mediocre at best.  I actually felt pretty ill after eating them for dinner, but again, that was a very busy night and they fell down on all counts that night.  I would have given them one or two stars that night, while both other experiences were at least a three or four.    I am not a big dessert eater (again with my missing hip bones) but we did the wine and chocolate sampler one night and it was fun enough and interesting enough to be worth the $16.  I shared that one with three friends.  It is worth a visit, especially if you are staying at the resort and have budgeted for an expensive night out.  I would, however, suggest you go very early if you go at peak season, and try to avoid a very chaotic rush.",

As others say, the view was phenomenal and the atmosphere was great.  I would have loved to have been there for dinner on a normal night, since what ruined it for me was the size of our group and the way that the dinner was served (buffet-line style, only by the time you got to the end of the buffet line you'd eaten the food you got at the last station - rinse and repeat, so you never really got to sit down).  There were plenty of nice, intimate places for people to gather though, and I liked the tiered outdoor seating areas.  The bartenders had a great sense of humor and everyone had a nice time.
