    "text": "I love this place, my favorite cuisine first of all is peruvian, and I am so happy to say that El Chullo has become my favorite peruvian restaurant (thus far in my culinary journey). The ceviche here is perfectly spiced, the texture of the fish is great, and the sweet potatoes and the canchas (salted corn nuts) offset the spiciness, wow just typing this review makes my mouth water. I literally cannot wait to go back for more! The entree size of the ceviche isn't enough if you are starved, but its a perfect portion for someone who isn't too hungry. My boyfriend and I ordered one ceviche each and then we also ordered a lomo saltado to share. The lomo El Chulo serves is great, delicious thin fries, with nicely seasoned juicy pieces of steak topped off with onions, red onions and tomatoes. Order this if you are a steak and potatoes type of person. For dessert we shared an alfajor, 2 fine light cookies with dulce de leche stuffed between the two, finished off with a slight dusting of powdered sugar and chocolate on the side.   To be perfectly honest I was so full already from eating a ceviche and sharing a lomo saltado that I felt that I didn't have any room for dessert, but when the cookie came I HAD to have a taste, so I ate a bite and we ended up packing that bad boy up to go. All in all this place was great, people might think its expensive, but its 100% worth it to me. The flavours I get from peruvian cuisine is so unique and unmatched that I am more than happy to pay for it. Oh and did I mention our server Manny, *unsure if this is the right spelling* but man he was the best!!! He made us feel right at home, and even told us a little bit of himself and Peru as we were eating our dinner.    All in all it was a great time and a great meal! I can't wait to go back.. perhaps I'll stop in for lunch and or dinner tonight because honestly I just can't get enough.",

I pointed that out that we would squeeze into one of the four tops and she said they were reserved. It was very apparent that we were not welcomed. They also seemed under staffed. I wanted to bring my small family to taste the food since I had come to this place before and enjoyed their food. Needles to say we will never be coming back.",

There is limited parking in the front, so we drove around the back where an ally way led to the restaurant's back parking lot, it was a tight squeeze to get to the parking lot so if your in an SUV or full size truck it's going to be tricky.   We went in and sat down and was greeted by the chief who was very accommodating and upbeat. The restaurant is clean an cozy the way a ma and pop place should feel. We ordered an appetizer of fried yucca that came with two sauces that were amazing! For drinks we ordered Chicha morada a Peruvian drink made with corn and spices, it was one of the best drinks I have ever had. In fact we had four glasses of the stuff, unfortunately there were no refills for Chicha but the chef gave us our last glass free! Regardless it's worth it.   For our entree we both got the ceviche. OMG, I kid you not it was the best ceviche I have ever had. The ceviche was bass seasoned with red onions lime and Peruvian chilis. There was a side of inca corn and sweet potatoes, the potatoes added a refreshing sweet to the tangy ceviche. My cousin who lived in Mexico for two years said he ate ceviche regularly and said that Peruvian ceviche was the best you could get.  Please give this place a try you won't regret it!!",

The server was really friendly and he tried to give us recommendations.  I ordered the Lomo Saltado and it was flavorful, but I didn't see the difference between that and the nacho fries that you get at Filibertos for half the price. Now, don't get me wrong.  It was a cool experience, but when we got the bill, it was a little much for an appetizer sampler, a drink, one entree, and dessert. I didn't even end up with a doggie bag for the price we paid. I didn't expect to pay as much as what we had paid, but I know they have to pay their bills.  It's a  business.  I get it.   I just don't know if I would justify the price and value of the food to come back.  If you have never had peruvian food, come on over though and try it. At least once.",

So I was excited to try it out but my experience was just... meh. Maybe I should have stuck to the tried-and-True like ceviche or Lomo saltado or aji de gallina, but I was developing a cough and a sore throat so I wanted chicken soup, and so ordered aguadito, a cilantro-based chicken soup on their menu. It was much too salty and the broth was literally green instead of being clear - though that's probably the way it should be, I don't know because I have never had this particular soup before.  The ambience is that of a little hole in the wall family-run restaurant and the service was fine. If the opportunity presented itself I might go back to try some of the mainstay menu items, but I wouldn't run back.",

It's not a big place, but once it filled up, the one waitress was running. Also, parking is limited, which is typical for DT Phoenix. Highly recommend trying at least once. Our favorites were: Lomo saltado (beef with French fries and gravy-like sauce), papa rellena (stuffed potato), tallarin saltado con carne (tenderloin with spaghetti) and of course pisco sours!",

    "text": "On my first visit here I tried the causa rellena and the ceviche mixto. The causa rellena was a very flavorful potato and crab (the filling I chose) appetizer which was so dense that the dish could have been a meal by itself. I was already feeling a bit full when my entree arrived - a beautifully presented ceviche generously loaded with seafood. Needless to say, I was extremely full that visit and managed to happily waddle to my car. On the second visit I tried their tasty lomo saltado and capped the meal with an alfajor, a confection consisting of two delicate cornstarch cookies with a filling of scrumptious dulce de leche. The excellent quality of the food justifies the prices that are slightly higher than you may initially expect from a restaurant that does not have a fancy atmosphere. Service is friendly and efficient, and although parking is limited in front of this establishment, there is an additional parking area at the back, accessible through the alleyway behind the commercial strip in which the restaurant is found.",

I also had pisco which is Peruvian brandy and trust me that stuff will sneak up on you, I had the mango pisco sour please try it!  And you guys know I am a sucker for dessert  I ordered   Alfajores, basically a cookie sandwich but don't be fooled this cookie sandwich comes straight from the cookie gods lol. I also ordered Lucuma ice cream which is a tropical fruit that honestly tastes better than pumpkin spice anything.   Customer service is amazing! Very friendly and funny staff highly recommend this",

We walked in and were seated at one of the two remaining tables...good sign  We started by splitting a 'choose three' appetizer platter. We got the Papa Rellena, Yuca Frita, and I don't remember the name of the third. The Papa Rellena was really good - tasted kind of like a tamale, but better - and served with some pickled onions, I think?  Really tasty - this was the best.  The Yuca Frita was good.  The  other one was about a 4\" diameter cylindrical shaped item about 1 1/2\" tall.  It had chicken in it - I thought it tasted like deviled eggs - it was also very good, but we had to save room for the main course.  My wife ordered the Ceviche - it was very good - had a lot of zing to it.  Everybody else ordered the Lomo Saltado.  It was also really good.  Our server was friendly and attentive as well.  Very nice place to go and get your Peruvian gnosh on.",

You can also enter through doors on the back or walk around to the front.  We shared an appetizer and each got a meal and drink waters and our total bill was approximately $36.  We loved everything.

Canada once again is unable to become #1 in anything bc Lomo Saltado is a better french fry dish than Poutine.   Also, that Ceviche is bangin.   As a side-note, the whole meal (which involved just the two aforementioned dishes) featured like 4 different types of corn, which was a really interesting and awesome thing. Never really appreciated corn for its versatile beauty before. These guys had it roasted/salted as a snack-a-tizer, juiced in this delicious drink called Chicha Morada (i think thats its name), and then two other types in the ceviche (a wee lil corn and a big honkin type of Korn). All in all, really opened my eyes to the wonders of corn and i am very thankful.   lastly, a supremely friendly waitstaff and a very wonderfully priced/tasting Malbec. What more could you want?",

I can't pronounce the names of each of the entrees, but I have to say that they were very well prepared and presented. All of the food we had was just excellent. They weren't too spicy and artfully presented. They also serve Peruvian drinks. The waitress was very kind and able to explain each of the dishes, and each was delicious. Joining us this week were my daughter and her husband who is Chilean/Peruvian - so we had a subject matter expert. The Jolly Diners rated El Chullo a 3.5 out of 5. The decor is nice, parking is a bit challenging, but worth it because the food tastes great and is reasonably priced.If you like to try something different and authentically Peruvian, you'll have to try El Chullo.",

I took off one star for service. When we got there it took a long time for anyone to even offer water, and we were extremely thirsty from the heat. When we were ordering I asked for an explanation about the food preparation and the waitress seemed annoyed that I couldn't understand the word in Spanish she was using and she just kept repeating it when I kept asking for a different explanation. The food took a while to come out. I will definitely come back though! The food is just so good!",

The chicken is described as pan fried but it didn't taste fried, and I mean that in a good way, and the sauce was very tasty.  My wife loved the tallarines verdes-- pesto spaghettis (yes, spaghetti with an s) and steak.  And for dessert: a giant alfajor, cookies with dulce de leche filling. Overall, a great first Peruvian food experience",

I had the maracuya sour beverage which seemed to me like pisco sour with a tart passion fruit flavor: LOVED IT! I dined upon the causa relleno with crab appetizer and it was quite tasty. It is almost like a mashed potato disc-cake with a layer of crab in between. I also enjoyed the seafood ceviche, though I prefer to call it by its real name which is la Leche de Tigre. A good amount of spice and heat in the almost milky colored sauce, the Peruvians certainly know how to prepare lime saturated seafood! Definitely will return and eat everything on this menu.",

My table had the Chupe de Camarones, which was a meal unto itself, 2 people had the the Aji de Gallina- which was very tasty and quite spicy and one had the Tallarines Verdes con Lomo.  We had traditional Pisco sours which were quite tasty as well.  The restaurant is very small but clean and the wait staff is vey pleasant.  The service is slow due to all plates being made to order but that is certainly one of the reasons the food is delicious.  I would definitely recommend this place if you are a fan of Peruvian food or curious to learn about it.  The prices are resonable as well. Our tab for 4 came to $153 and that was with 8 Pisco sours.

I feel like I should always try these tiny places with \"foreign\" food but I never really do because I'm afraid most would be misses rather than hits. This was a hit and has inspired to try more places like this! Our friends had heard good things about this place so we gave it a shot and I will keep going back!  We ordered a few apps to share: Anticucho, Papa Rellena, and Yuca Frita. We loved them all! The Anticucho and Yuca Fritas were so good I will definitely order them every time I go!  Then each of us order an entree. I got the Arroz con Mariscos, Jess got the Arroz con Pollo, my fiance the Ceviche and Josh the Lomo Saltado.   To be honest I was pretty disappointed with my dish because it was more like a plate of rice with 4 pieces of seafood. However, Jess' Pollo tasted amazing, it had great seasoning. Mike's cveiche and Josh's Lomo were great too. We all left stuffed and happy!  We will definitely be going back. Love the vibe of a family restaurant. We also recommend the Pisco Sours!  It is a tiny place so if it's full you may have to wait. It'll be worth it!",

On the downside parking is a nightmare and it's in a seriously sketchy looking neighborhood next to a smoke shop/liquor.",

    "text": "I love Peruvian cuisine and really wanted to like this place. I went with a few friends on our lunch break. The waitress was helpful with food suggestions. They didn't have any lunch specials which was a bummer because the prices were ridiculously high. While waiting really long for our food the power went out. It was also hot and stuffy so you leave smelling like garlic and onions.They also didn't have my tallarin with chicken ready until basically it was time for me to leave. I had to remind the waitress several times until I finally went up to the register and asked for my food to go. So did not get the full dining experience. Anyway, when I got back to work I realized they messed up my order. They gave me steak instead of chicken. I was hungry so I ate it and the steak was undercooked. I was so dissatisfied I called them to see if someone could rectify the issue. Karen answered the phone and was so rude. She became combative and not customer service oriented at all. She wouldn't put a manager on the phone that is when I decided to leave a review.",

We were hosted by a friend from Peru and he made sure we tried so many different items off the menu.  My favorite items were the Lomo Saltado.  It was really tender beef and so flavorful.  The ceviche was amazing too.  And something I didnt think I would  like, but tried anyway was the beef heart kabobs.  It was delicious!!  Oh and they have amazing flan for dessert.  Our waiter grew up in Lima, Peru and he told us so many cool things about Peru and the food there.  We will definitely come back here again.  They also have live music sometimes and host events.  We parked in the front of the resturant, right off 7th St and that was awkward.  We did find out that there is better parking in the back, so park in the back and come in through the back door.",

I went with my girlfriend from California and she helped guide my newbie tastes. We started our first course with a Papa Rellena - a fried breaded potato with meat and raisin filling- absolutely delicious. It even reminded me a little of a Filipino dish at home, which was a bonus. Then we had the Causa Rellena de Pollo, which is sort of like a chicken salad meets this bomb yellow sauce on steroids. I can't think of another way to explain it but there was also an egg there and avocado, so there was a medley of flavors that all meshed together.  I ordered the Ceviche Mixto which had onions, lime, shrimp, squid, and more. It was everything a seafood lover could have dreams about because the seafood was fresh and the seasonings- refreshing.  Finally, we ordered the Alfajor for dessert. If you love Tres Leches or have a sweet tooth of any kind, you must order this! It helps that there were pictures of this award winning dessert all over the walls.  Overall, the restaurant is unassuming but who cares? The food was excellent and our waitress was kind and attentive. For my first time trying Peruvian, I can honestly report it will not be my last!",

I was immediately hit with the flavor of the rice.  It's as if they mixed delicious chimichuri sauce with white rice.  The dark meat of the chicken was juicy and the skin was crisp.  The onion garnish on the side even had amazing tangy flavor I've never had before.  El Chullo took a basic dish and nailed it.  On my second trip, I wanted to explore the menu so I went with the Escabeche de Pollo.  That dish has become one of the best things I have ever tried.  The sauce is the star of the dish with its amazing savory flavor.  It magnified the juicy dark meat of the chicken.  The dish also came with a pyramid of white rice, a couple of nicely crisped slices of sweet potatoes that paired nicely with the escabeche sauce, and those tangy onions I have come to love.  Third trip, I had the Lomo Saltado.  It's basically like loaded fries.  Not bad.    Appetizers, oh my.  The Papa Rellena is amazing.  It's a ball of mash potato that is filled with meat, hard egg, olives, and raisins.  The outside of the potato ball is fried shut so it holds it's shape.  Don't let the raisins stop you from trying it, it's not overpowering.   Try this place",

Lomo saltado was little salty and around $17  we are visiting from Los Angeles and maybe we are just spoiled but there's a big difference. FYI the explanation for the extra charge was that they use sirloin!!! Well in Los Angeles they use Fillet Mignon!

This place had great reviews and a friend of mine also suggested it so I had to try it out. We called ahead of time to get a reservation and they said they could \"likely squeeze us in\" which was strange since there were not many people there when we arrived. We didn't get a very friendly vibe from the service in general. Our table got the fish ceviche, chicken tacu tacu and the seafood tacu tacu to share. The food was really great but it was all really salty! I generally like my food to be salty but it was even too much for me. In the future I would make sure to ask for less salt on the meals. Otherwise it was really flavorful.",

She was very patient with us and answered all of our silly questions and gave us both great recommendations! Both dishes (fish Ceviche and the TACU TACU CON LOMO AL JUGO) were both super flavorful! I ordered the ceviche, mainly because I was a little scared of trying anything else. Haha I know I'm a wuss sometimes. Anyway... The ceviche was FABULOUS. It was super fresh and like I mentioned before, super flavorful! I tried my friends Tacu Tacu dish and it was also awesome! Both dishes came with a very large portion! Neither of use could finish our plates.   So, my only dislike was how expensive this place is!! It's defiantly a dinner place and not a lunch spot. I ended up paying 30$ (including tip) for just my lunch. To me that's pretty steep for lunch... for dinner I wouldn't mind paying that much but woah!!! I'd love it if they had a lunch menu with smaller portions for a little less expensive.   All in all my experience was a good one and I'll be back but only for dinner.",

Besides the temperature, I loved the place.  Seemed like a mom and pop shop which I always like.  So lets change it up and  talk food.  Wow....  It was tasty!  Got the Papa a La Huancaina for an appetizer and it was amazing.  I was disappointed at first because it looked so plain, just boiled potatoes cut in half smothered in a sauce.  However, after that first bite I was hooked.  These were amazing.  Got a couple of their drinks, and they were pretty tasty as well, however I wouldn't get those again.  My wife got Tallarines Verdes and it was amazing.  The pasta was a great pesto green color, which had initially concerned me it would have too strong of a pesto flavor.  It did not.  The pasta was actually nice and creamy with a perfect amount of flavor.  I got the Ceviche Mixto.  This was outstanding.  The assortment of seafood was great, the presentation was pretty, and the sauce was amazing.  Packed full of a nice lime-kick with some spice.  The waiter talked me out of going 'spicy' and went for 'medium' instead, which was probably a good idea.  Medium had a nice amount of spice that built up, but was never too spicy to ruin or mask flavors.  I would love to go back and try some other options the food was very good.",

    "text": "The BEST Peruvian Food Ever!!!  El Chullo beats  the taste of a home made Peruvian meal. I live in Hawaii and when I travel I always search for restaurants that serve \"traditional\" Peruvian food. Growing up in Peru with parents who made delicious meals, I must say that El Chullo is now my favorite place to eat... no offense to my parents wonderful cooking.   The Food is simply AMAZING!!!  The service is excellent and the size of each dish is to satisfy a hungry bear. My advice to those who enjoy authentic food is to order different meals since they all are delicious and the price is cheaper than it should be.  Ceviche is the best known Peruvian dish in the world and they make it to perfection. This dish is mixed with lemon juice and some onion and they add their own flavor to it.  I haven't eaten Tacu Tacu in many years and I couldn't believe how delicious this dish was. I had it with mariscos (seafood). The beans had a little crunch to it and the flavor just made my mouth water...I'm getting hungry just to think about it.  The tamales are just like the ones I used to eat at home on the weekends: smooth, soft, flavorful and with the light orange color that I used to love. For dessert, The Alfajor was delicious. I couldn't believe how big it was. It was fresh and made in-house.    Since I was in Phoenix for 7 days I ate several days here to try different dishes. I had their weekend breakfast special which included pork, fried sweet potato, tamale and onion sauce. I would recommend everyone to try it; It will satisfy 2 people. The Causa Rellena is a famous appetizer in Peru made with layered mash potatoes and vegetables inside. Their sauce was rich and completely different than the one I make at home and it sure beats my recipe. The Aji de Gallina was creamy and very flavorful.   I wish I had spent more time in Phoenix to try all the dishes El Chullo serves. I would recommend this family owned restaurant to everyone looking for the best food in town.  Parking is located on the front of the building and 10-12 additional stalls on the back.",

They start everyone of with tasty complimentary corn nuts. We started with the Peruvian Specialty Appetizer called papas a la huancaina that means basically a boiled potato topped with a creamy chile cheese sauce. I thought it tasted good but for me this dish is an acquired taste kind of dish because of the texture.   I ordered the Arroz Chaufa (a chicken fried rice) because it sounded like the lightest dish on the menu. The chicken in my dish was developed with flavor and was very moist. I thought this dish was tasty but it was an extremely large portion so I took half home.  My husband had the Frijol con Seco a la Nortena (basically a beef stew with rice and beans). I tried a little piece of beef that also was prepared well and was flavorful and moist. The pickled onions were bright and bursting with lime flavor. This was also a large portion.  The pictures of the desserts looked interesting and mostly different from other desserts I've seen and our server talked me into getting his favorite dessert the crema volteada. It was like a very dense flan with a dark sugar coating. It seemed rich and wasn't too sweet.  Service was very friendly and welcoming.",

My friend got the Lomo Saltado and I got the Pollo with the orange sauce that I do not remember the name. I also got the Maracuya juice (asked not to be made with sugar and they were nice to do so) juice was not watery, it was really good. Food had awesome flavors and presentation.  Aji seemed to be made with rocoto (aji, which translates to chili for those just used to that word) which was amazingly flavorful.  The service was nice.  Only thing I did not like too much was that the tables are a little too small, and I felt I had to arrange plate, sauce, glass and other items in a perfect way so I can eat comfortably. Also, difficult to park in the front and I am not sure if parking is allowed by the liquor store next door.  Overall really good! I recommend it!",

How bad could it be?    Well, I would have rather eaten somewhere else. The best thing about the meal was the drink of lucuma juice. It was delicious. Everything else, not worth waiting for. And that was everyone's sentiment.  For the meat eaters, any dish with flavor was just salty. For the vegetarians, the food was not flavorful at all. In fact it was outright bland. Even the sauces were bland! That's hard to swallow, especially when the meal consists of all starchy foods. (potatoes, corn, peas, rice)  For the meat eaters plates included: appetizers of Causa Rellena (two tier potato cake with chicken filling), Papa Rellena (fried potato dough stuffed with meat), Papa a la huancaina (boiled sliced potatoes covered with sauce and egg) and then chicken entrees.   For the vegetarians plates included: appetizer of Yucca Frita (fried yucca with dipping sauce), entree of veggie Causa Rellena (two tier potato cake with creamy vegetable filling), and sides of Sarsa de Cebolla (onions marinated in lime juice) and Camote Frito (thin strips of salty fried sweet potato). The onions saved the meal. Without them, there would have been no other flavor.  I will try Peruvian food again, but not at El Chullo.",

    "text": "The lomo saltado, signature Peruvian dish, was quite disappointing. The papas a la huancaina was disappointing as well - I guess the sauce was fine but needed more of the expected Peruvian \"kick\" aka yellow chili. Finally, the chupe de camarones soup tasted good but only had 5 regular size shrimp and 1 jumbo shrimp in it - seriously I counted - so it was not worth the price :(  I was so excited to try a Peruvian place in PHX but maybe because I was expecting to much I felt the place wasn't very good and would probably not go back.",

Waited outside for 40 mins for opening time and there was a rush of people who entered together. My husband and I were the first to get it..... We seated ourselves and then noticed the servers attended 4 other tables before us.......small establishment so not a lot of tables and service was very slow.  Finally got attended to and the food took an hour to come out. Highly salted and my husband lost his appetite after the long wait.   The server was nice and apologized but I'm still giving one star because I can't understand how this establishment got such a high rating.",

I got the Arroz Chaufa- very good and enough for two with a Maracuya Sour. Bf got the Lomo Saltado with the chef's suggestion of an added egg (very helpful), which he loved. We shared a Yuca Frita, which was really good, and they were super nice and made a sauce without onions so I could eat it (allergic to onions). If we ever come this way again, we'll be sure to come back. And for all of you who live in Phoenix, definitely take the opportunity to check this place out!",

As far as that last review by a lady named Leslie, I think she was way too hard on them. Some of the very very very best restaurants are just small little places, and family owned.! Sometimes you have to have patience when places like that are busy. They always always are welcoming, so she must of had an attitude problem. And that's probably hitting the nail on the head! I love this place and so do many of my friends. Don't let it get you down, El. chullo! We still luv you!  It's the best Peruvian food in the whole valley! And I've been to the other ones.

Delicious and nicely presented on the plate.  People at our table ordered ceviche and arroz con pollo - both looked very good.  Apparently Peru is celebrating \"La semana del Chilcano\" (Chilcano Week) and El Chullo has a 7-Day Special two-for-one during Happy Hour from Friday 1/11 to Friday 1/18.  A chilcano cocktail is made with Peruvian pisco brandy, ginger ale, lime and angostura bitters.  Knowing there are thousands of varieties of potatoes in Peru, I neglected to ask if they serve other varieties with different tastes, textures, shapes or colors.  I also ordered the picarones - beignet-like doughnuts seasoned with anise seeds and served with a honey sauce.  Quite good - even though I don't care for anise.  All of the servers here were very attentive - really focused on making the diner happy.  The dining room is quite small and had two or three TVs.  I enjoyed the Peruvian TV shows, but not everybody would.",

On my first visit, we followed our server's recommendation and indulged with the appetizer sampler and the portions were HUGE. Then, we tacked on two entrees and wound up leaving with leftovers and no room for dessert!  One of the entrees was the arroz chaufa con marisocs - a savory seafood fried rice rich in flavor.  On my most recent visit, I had the lomo saltado. I know it's a traditional Peruvian dish... my GOODNESS: the tender, tasty marinated beef! Served on a bed of french fries with a side of rice? A carb-lover's dream! It's like an asian-inspired poutine.  Picking a favorite is hard!  I also recommend the traditional Pisco Sour cocktail - a frothy, tart but sweet concoction with Peruvian brandy (called pisco) as the base.

The calamari was over cooked and chewy which was not a big deal. The huge problem was the excessive amount of salt the entree contained. The meal was not enjoyable. The silver lining to this was the green chicken soup I ordered my daughter. She seemed to enjoy it very much. The plantains were the highlight of the night and ideally cooked. My wife enjoyed her lomo saltado. I do not think I will be visiting this establishment again as I was highly disappointed. Maybe I ordered the worst dish they had?",

The wait was 45 min and there is a tiny bar with 5 chairs you can wait with a  cocktail if there's space. We all had ceviche mixto which was amazing. My daughter had the spaghetti with meat sauce which I tasted and it was off the charts good. The cocktails are pricey, but good. There is limited parking out front , but later we realized there is back parking with a door you can enter. We definitely be headed back there when we are in Phoenix again!",

I've been several times, and the food is always delicious. My favorite is the Tacu Tacu with lomo. I get it every time, but I know I should try other things too! The ceviche and lomo soltado are also very good. The ceviche is fresh, and the lomo just doesn't disappoint - full of flavor!   This time around, I fortunately had a friend who was wanting to split two dishes! I forget the one she got (it's in the pictures), but it was a beef stew. The beef was very tender, but we both agreed the Tacu Tacu was better of the two. The Tacu Tacu has a great consistency and texture. It's crispy on the outside and firm, not mushy, on the inside. The lomo that comes with it is in a sauce with onions and tomatoes - very flavorful!   The ooooooonly thing that I'll say bad about this place that it may be a tad too salty sometimes.    Overall, I'm a big fan....and I need more people who are willing to split dishes with me!! :)",

The service is very good and the portions are very generous. For desert we had the  Leche asada and alfajores. I did not think i could like caramel before i had the alfajores. For drinks, try the pisco mango.  This place deserves a first visit and then a repeat visit with those who havent been here ( thats how i was initiated!) .",

    "text": "We decided to live up to our hype of being open-minded and try something unique to Phoenix (i.e., not Mexican; not Vietnamese; not Chinese; etc.).  And that's how we ended up at El Chullo; though, to be fair, we almost DIDN'T end up at El Chullo's.  A previous reviewers comment about parking being limited is like saying Marlon Brando was slightly overweight towards the end.  Let's just say, the parking lot is shared with other businesses; the \"lot\" is about one car wide; and one has to do fancy gyrations to park and withdraw one's car IF one can get a spot.  After driving around three times, we parked in the printing shop's lot across the street (which, I'm sure, will thrill them to no end when/if they read this).  Go during the standard 9 to 5 business hours and you may find yourself outta luck or risking a tow.  Alas, the parking spots are not the only thing small about El Chullo.  In fact, \"small\" pretty much describes it all:  the parking. the restaurant, the portions.  I was rather amused (bemused) by the comment from one of the reviewers that the portions are \"very large\".  Really?  VERY large?  Perhaps for someone who survived  internment at Sherrif Joe's Tent City or who usually dines on those diet programs' pre-packaged food (served in upscale concentration camps).  Granted, this is not to say that the portions were pretentiously small like a la carte francais food; they were perfectly acceptably sized for people, who eat like they're supposed to  (translation:  non-Americans).  We, however, are of the MOO crowd, so for us, all of dinner was something akin to \"snack\".  (Hey, I workout, get off my case!).  We started out with the appetizer platter for $14.95 and chose the Chicken Causa Rell; the Papa Rellena; and the Papa ala Huancaina.  Presented very artistically, I would not say it was an appetizer for two AMERICANS.  Taste was quite good and unique, though the standout taste was potato (hardly a surprise since \"papa\" means 'potato').  I had a very spicy cerviche mixto and my other half, the escabeche de pollo.  Both very good -- the latter served with rice and a small portion of cold, sweet potato -- but we weren't exactly unbuckling our belts at meal's end.  Again, like I said:  not small, but not big by the usual, middle-class American standards, where the men are men, eat like men, and doctors buy brand new cars every month with all the money they get from bypass and pacemaker surgeries.  Nuff said.  The diet Inka Cola, colored like Mountain Dew but tasting like cream soda, is good, but $2.00 a can?  For both of us, the bill came to $46.41 without tip.  Not tragic, but a bit overboard for the quantity.  Maybe reasonable considering the uniqueness of the food.  The 20% tip for Omar, however, was well in line.  Attentive service without being overbearing and very accommodating.  That's one thing I really can't make any complaints about (and as you see, I have no issue complaining).  While I agree with the other, previous 17 reviewers that this is a very nice restaurant, I am not wowed enough to give it 5 Stars.  Those who read my reviews know I'm not generous with my highest rating and you've got to earn it.  For those looking for something different, tasty and served with good attitude, this restaurant is just fine.  If you're a big eater, don't expect to come here and not want something more afterwards.  No one there looked unhappy and we weren't either ... just not full.",

The tallarines verdes is the best I've had in Arizona and I will only go to El Chullo to have it. You know how you grab on to your bed sheets because the feeling is so glorious and out of this world? Yes, it's like that! I can't wait to try the other entrees, specifically, the vegetarian options. The alfajores is also delicious; flaky but held it's form and not overwhelmingly sweet - it definitely quieted my sweet tooth. The chicha morada is also quenching - not bitter and too sweet, just right - be sure to order the pitcher because you will drink it like water.  It's a quaint place to eat. They have lunch specials/combo. The parking situation is a little challenging, but I would like to go there at least once a week to satisfy my Peruvian food cravings. I hope you check out this place because although it's easy to miss (because of location), you'll be sorry if you don't go.",

LOVED IT! LOVED IT! The ambiance, the people, the fact that a mother and father along with their two sons run this place was a huge plus for me. Along with their Momma, the sons are the chefs creating some of their own along with recipes handed down by their ancestors. The flavors are incredible. I can't wait to take the family back. Another fabulous local go to place for me... Woohoo!!!!",

Out of all of them, I believe that El Chullo has the best food of them all. I've had their ceviche, lomo saltado, and jalea. All of which were excellent. I would give it 5 stars if ratings were based only on the food! Not only does it taste great, it even is presented beautifully.  Now, what brings this place down is the location. My biggest gripe is the A/C seems to not always be running cool. Not to mention it isn't the nicest looking of restaurants. For the price I expect a bit more class. Not super fancy, just a touch more.  And yes, it's central Phoenix. So parking is tight.",

Her brother in the kitchen is also very funny and friendly.   I would definitely recommend making a visit.

I really want to go back to have some pisco sour :) Parking is hard as the store is facing 7th st and there are only 5 to 6 spots in the front; so park in the back and come in.  Main cross roads are 7th st and McDowell. Head north on 7th street and it will be in the corner of Virginia - NE corner.",

The wait staff was appreciative of my Castellano and as a Limeno, know the ropes.  The papa relleno was great and prepared with a crisp exterior.  The lomo saltado was extremly tender, but startingly more trendy than authentic.  It lacked the bold asian flvors that are part of Peru's subculture and would make Fujimori proud.  The Aji de gallina tasted as if it was from a paste rather than real aji amarillos.  While some dishes are good, It is better to excel at least with the popular national dishes.  I will have to try agsain.",

    "text": "This is a great restaurant! The food is always delicious. If you're tired of the same ol Mexican dishes and want to try something different than that, or want to maybe impress a lady with your advanced knowledge of world cuisine, this is a welcomed change of pace.  Our regular dishes are  *Ceviche mixto - hot*  The most delicious \"white\" ceviche, bathed in a scorching pinkish sauce. If I have it right, it has strips of fish, lil octopi, calamari, tiny scallops, tiny clams, and mussels. The heat of the hot isn't for wimps, but is addicting like flaming hot Cheetos. I.E. you can't stop or the burning really starts.  *Jalea Mixta* Basically a fried version of the above, minus the fiery sauce. The breading is crisp and delicious. Not spicy like the ceviche though. *Lomo Saltado* I would describe this as gourmet carne asada fries or as Peruvian poutine. Tender and flavorful steak strips over a bed of fries smothered in a light and savory gravy sauce. This being accompanied by the most perfectly cooked and tasty onions (I generally loathe onions) and a few tomatoes.  Everyone I have brought here has, at a minimum, enjoyed this restaurant. Most have loved it. This includes my boss, who can be, we'll say - \"picky\" about new foods from different cultures and food in general. We are located in Deer Valley and he has actually brought this place up as a place to go since being introduced. That's saying a lot.  There are a couple of downsides to El Chullo, but not enough for me to remove any stars.  *Parking* The front is a tiny lil strip of parking for maybe 5 cars max that you have to basically pull off of the road and slide into the parking spot. You could try to pull in and be left sticking out into busy 7th street traffic. The back is accessible through a narrow alley and is a very tight maybe 8 car lot. I've parked back there and had to do an ass clinched 40 point turn to get out when it filled up after. Maybe take an Uber if you don't want to bother with that.  *seating* This place is small, don't bring a big party! They don't have a lot of room in the dining area for that. It fills up quick and if you are an ornery sumbich your lil tushy might get hurt waiting for the delicious food. *pisco sour price* Damn this is an awesome drink. But at $14 bucks a pop, can't down 3-4 of these like I would like to. The homie that was a Scottsdale bartender for years loves these so that should tell you how good they are. I'm sure the price is well worth it, but it just stings to see the bill if you've enjoyed a few.  So yes, there's a whole bunch of info for you. If you're on the fence, swan dive off, and make the trip because this place rules!",

They do not have lunch specials and it will cost you close to $20 for lunch.  Peruvian food in general is not hot. Id asked about this and they were very willing to accommodate me with a bottle of hot sauce. I refused. If that is not how it's supposed to be.  The food is mild and flavorful. There is a spaghetti dish made with beef. I have had it elsewhere made with fish. The real value meal was the seafood platter, with many and plenty of kinds of fish. Most dishes have a pyramid of rice. Others are over French Fries.  Service is as fast as the kitchen. The wait staff is very friendly and informative. The menu is explanatory to a degree. It needs supplementation. The server knew the menu well. El Chullo had no empty seats. They don't need to offer lunch specials.   The oldest reviews date back to 2014, so they have not just started up. Despite the cramped quarters and lack of parking, they have stayed in business. Maybe someday they will get more space inside and outside.   There are many items on the menu to try, but the lack of lower prices at lunchtime will keep me away.",

    "text": "I ate here on April 1, 2017 with 15 other people in an ethnic dining MeetUp.  I also ate here last fall, the day after having a bad dinner at Villa Peru. Villa Peru wanted to charge me for the very bland Chupe de Camarones Soup, that I wanted to send back to trade for something else, even though I only ate a few spoonfuls of the broth.  I never had any restaurant force me to pay for what I did not like and wanted to send back and trade for something else, in my life, and I am 20 years older than I look!  I went to Villa Peru 2 years ago, and also did not like my food, neither did other people at my table, to the point that they still had to pay for their wasted dish, AND pay for a side of \"safe french fries\" just because they were so hungry.   But I was open to giving Villa Peru another chance.   I Yelped Villa Peru 1 star because of bland, expensive, skimpy food, and scathing service.    The first time I ate at El Chullo, was the day after the Villa Peru fiasco, I ate the cerviche.  But the fish in both the Villa Peru and El Chullo, was very bland, boring, and flavorless.  It tasted like they just added the lime juice marinate to the fish the moment before bringing the fish to my table.  So I took it home, and four days later, the lime permeated the fish, and it tasted delicious!    But I did not Yelp El Chullo based on the one-time bland and boring fish in their cerviche, only.  I wanted to give El Chullo another chance, which i did when I ate with these 15 other people on April 1.  I tasted so many dishes, including cerviche second chance.  Very bland and boring, I mean the flavor of the fish.  I like my own homemade cerviche the best.  The steak was flavorful and good portion, but very gristley and full of oingy boingies not polite to spit out.",

    "text": "El Chullo. When I saw on Yelp that this place was awesome, and I was in town, I definitely had to check it out. I've had Peruvian before, and this was a little something different. I know that there were a lot of Chinese influence on Peruvian food, sot his was exciting to check out what Phoenix had. Let's just say, I never had Peruvian like this. We ordered some different type of food so it was nice to the different options.  For the appetizers, we ordered the appetizer platter which we got the chance to try out three different types of apps. We ordered the Beef heart the Stuffed potato, and the frite. The beef heart and the stuffed potatoes were amazing. I would definitely recommend those if you're choosing between the two. The beef heart isn't as bad as you think it would be, the meat was quite tender and had a good amount of flavor. The frites were alright, there was actually nothing special to it.   For the Entree, I ordered the Frijol con seco a la nortena. It was pretty good, and it really was sort of leaning on just a beef stew. It came with beans, but the stew was well balanced and had a good amount of flavor. My first choice for entree they ran out and so I had to settle on this as it was something that caught my eye. Anyways, it's pretty normal, but it hits the spot.  Now, as far as the interior decor, that's something new. It's a little hole in the wall spot. It's something that you won't be used to, but then again a lot of places that I had experience in Phoenix was pretty much hole in the wall. This place is definitely legit though, with the nice soap operas on tv and and everything so simplistic.  Definitely, this place is somewhere you need to check out if you're wanting to try something out that's not Mexican and something new.",

    "text": "First tip-Parking lot in the back through an alley. Easier than the front.  My friend and I came here to check it out and overall, we loved it. We came on a Saturday for lunch and it wasn't crowded so we got one on one personal treatment with the chef so we learned a lot.  Not to sound like a broken record but the ceviche is soooo good. I love the flavors. The ceviche is just the fish marinated and the ceviche mixto is fish, squid, mussels, and clams.  I think the ceviche of just fish is the better of the two. It just holds the flavor better.  And when they ask you how spicy, they actually mean it. The medium is pretty decently spicy.  So impressive since it's hard to actually get something to be spicy here in Phoenix.  I can only imagine how spicy hot is.  Been here three times and I still crave it.  Ok, on to other things I've tried several things and so far only one thing wasn't all that great but everything else has been. The causa rellena with imitation crab would be the one thing i say to avoid. My friend and I didnt think it was all that great esp. The arroz con pollo was yummy. The carapulcra is a pork stew and is like a comfort food.  If you like spicy, make sure to ask for the aji rocoto - Peruvian hot sauce/salsa. So yummy. It adds a good spice to the mild dishes.  Good lomo saltado according to bf. I do like that the fries are crispy and skinny.  The kicker is that if you go now, they finally have air conditioning!!!  It was getting to be a bit difficult going during the summer so I can only imagine how the workers felt.  Warning though, if you are from California and used to Peruvian food there, they don't carry the green aji sauce that we know and love.  Apparently that's only a CA creation since we're so used to jalapenos. This is a must place. From the wait staff to the food, everything is too notch.",

The wait staff were friendly and efficient. I had the Yuca Fritas appetizer and Mariscos con Arroz entree. I enjoy the Yuca and the two sauces. Some of the Yuca pieces were hard and stringy, but the rest was quite nice. The Mariscos were a disappointment. A few pieces of the seafood were very hard and chewy like they were seriously overlooked. These pieces were inedible. Most of the rest of the dish was good, but not great. I was expecting more flavor that would make this uniquely Peruvian. I will come back again and order a completely different entree. I want to like this place and I think it's definitely worth another shot.",

My friend had the Arroz Con Pollo (Cilantro based green rice with veggies, & pan fried chicken) I had the Arroz Chaufa (Peruvian/Chinese Fusion Style chicken fried rice). Both dishes were great. Mine looked a bit like a standard fried rice but had a much bigger punch of flavor. The highlight of his dish was definitely that cilantro rice. SO GOOD. He ordered white meat and his bone-in breast was a bit dry. I am a dark meat gal, so would order that instead if I get it myself. I have to go back for the ceviche though. I saw a couple plates go by and wish I was not on a 1 hour work break. Those mountains of seafood need time to be savored. Man it looked good! Definitely will return.",

I had the Tacu Tacu Con Lomo Saltado, which is rice and beans topped with strips of marinated sirloin steak.  The rice must be cooked in a small cast iron skillet and flipped over, because it has a seriously delicious exterior with a slight crunch.  The beans and lomo saltado are equally excellent.  Portion sizes are large, and they have a small selection of wine.  Really delicious and highly recommend.    Parking: After business hours (ie: 6:00pm) you can park either across 7th street at the auto shop, or across Virginia street, just south of El Chullo, in the parking lot behind the 3 story building (Techniprint).",

While it seems to take forever to get meals, it seems because they really put a lot of care into the cooking and presentation of the meal.  For a little place, they don't just throw the food on a plate, but present it with rice molded in pyramids or hemispheres; appetizers can be multilayered in cylinders...all colorful and super flavorful.  But a number of the dishes do rely heavily on rice.  The one I had, which was basically rice with brown sauce and mushrooms and beans with a few other veggies, had the unique taste that the rice seemed crispy on top, like it had been run through the broiler.  I think it is these touches that may help take time to get the food.  But the waitstaff is friendly and was more than willing to make suggestions to those at our table that knew nothing of the cuisine.    Try the non-alc Peruvian drink...it is delicious, with a nice taste of cloves.  I like the unique flavors and generous portions and very reasonable prices.  Just don't expect to be in and out.  Good place to come with others to pass the time and chat.  I'm putting down \"NOT good for kids\"...because I don't think they'd have the patience.",

I had not seen this preparation before and as a Peruvian and a foodie I have an abundant amount of experience in Peruvian cuisine! The flavor was incredible, bursting with flavor! A bit of Rocoto to add a nice touch of spiciness. I had to order a side a rice so I could absorb all of the fabulous juice. My wife had a sampler platter with Papa a la Huancaina, papa rellena and causa! She raved about each of them. She also had an Afajor for dessert and it was wonderful! The owners are a family, each contributing to the success of the restaurant! Pricing is competitive. We went this evening  and had to wait about 15 minutes as we apparently are not the only ones who know about this wonderful little restaurant! The restaurant is small but as they continue to build a clientele, this place is certain to grow and be even more successful!",

    "text": "To give this review some context: I lived in Miami for two years before moving to Phoenix fairly recently, and was absolutely spoiled with great Peruvian/Venezuelan/Cuban/Latin Fusion food as a result. My dining partner returned from a trip to Peru about 6 months ago. We have both been craving authentic Peruvian, and we were both absolutely delighted by El Chullo.  We began with the Pisco sours, which exceeded our sky-high expectations. Perfectly balancing sweet and sour, with a nice kick, these were the highlight of the meal. For the mains, my aunt had the lomo saltado, tender beef with onions, tomatoes, and tasty fries. I had my go-to, Aji de Gallina, which is a creamy chicken dish made with turmeric and yellow peppers, served with rice and potatoes. Both were well-prepared and delicious, as well as large enough to take home. The only item that I wouldn't recommend as highly was the yucca starter - the sauces were good, but the large sticks of yucca were too starchy for either of us. Everything else was fantastic - and it should be noted that El Chullo has both a happy hour and daily specials, so you can try a number of different menu items. Next time, I'll have to try dessert as well!  Just a couple of logistical notes: space is limited in the front of the restaurant, so you might need to find parking nearby. El Chullo is also quite small, so I would recommend either a reservation or an early visit (my aunt and I went around 4 pm). Overall, this restaurant is a must-try for anyone who enjoys Latin food and Latin fusion - enjoy!",

You are given an option of sides. I chose rice and Peruvian beans. They also give you a cup of soup to start as well.  Given its in the middle of nowhere we thought it was a great find to satisfy our craving for Peruvian food.  Owners were very nice. Hopefully they can expand to a more visible place but was worth the effort and recommend ot.",

We order the tequenos as I'm Venezuelan and I love tequenos, these are not what I expected, but the dish was True to its description. The pisco was great and the rest of the food was good. We tried almost all the desserts and by far the ice cream was a winner, not very sweet, creamy and flavorful. The place was full and loud, but the service was good.  Overall I liked the place and I will go back again and try the ceviche.",

Authentic Peruvian food, and the staff seems to be well versed in Peruvian culture/food as well.   Because it is a small space we made reservations before coming in. I asked our waitress what she recommend I ordered and I ended up with a delicious seafood and rice meal. I was impressed with the amount of seafood and the variety. I also shared an appetizer that was deep fried potato stuffed with ground beef, hard boiled egg & raisins. Tasted like a yummy tater tot!   My only complaint is that the restaurant was a bit warm, almost like the air conditioner wasn't working well.   Happy to have dined here! It's always nice to experience another culture and their food.",

Swears by the potent benefits of leche de tigre.  This place was packed on Friday night! We were lucky and managed to grab the last table available. When it gets this busy it is very noisy from all the diners talking with each other so if you like a more chill and quiet dining experience come here on a less busy time.   All the menu items looked so appealing and most of the customers here were conversing with the servers and themselves in Spanish which seemed like a good sign that this place serves legit Peruvian food.  We started with the causa rellena de pollo. It was a beautiful presentation, a layered cold dish of potato, avocado, chicken salad, and hard boiled egg. To be honest I didn't care for it too much as it skewed too sour tasting for me but my husband really liked it so YMMV.  For the main course I had the escabeche de pollo. You have your choice of white or dark meat, I opted for white. When it came out it looked impressive! This was one massive mutant chicken breast! Perhaps it was previously on a Real Chickens of Maricopa County show in an episode where Clucky goes to Scottsdale for a little \"enhancement\". Anyways, it was smothered in this gorgeous red, absolutely delicious sauce, with 2 chunks of perfectly cooked sweet potato and a pyramid of long grain rice. That sauce really was amazing. I loved the blend of spices with its piquant flavor. It looked and smelled so good that the guy at the table next to me asked what it was because he had never seen it before and wanted some too! The chicken was tender and well seasoned.  I had a bite of the lomo saltado too which had tender beef pieces, nicely crisp fries smothered in a delicious beef gravy.  Service was very sweet but a bit slow since it was so busy. I also felt slightly irked when one of the servers started questioning my dietary preferences. Hey if I don't want to order something because there's an ingredient I can't have just let it be! Our meals also took some time to get served to us due to the rush of customers.   Parking is a bit tight in the front, but there might be a lot in the back too.",

Cleared my sinuses out immediately and about halfway through I had cleared the napkins from place settings within a 2 table radius. That being said the fish was fresh, the flavor was vibrant and while the peppers were hot, they were not obnoxious or distract from the sauces and seasonings.   Bottom line: if you are looking for something new that is light and refreshing, would recommend!",

Here's the tip:  The seafood looked bout 2x as good as the chicken and meat, but not much more expensive.  Bonus tip:  If you don't like potatoes, you're probably going to struggle with this food.  Potatoes were central to every dish we tried.  My wife and I had plenty of food and some beers for $40.",

There's available parking in the back which is a little easier to get in and out if the restaurant.  First time going here, I had to go with the classic Pollo Saltado and it was delicious! I lived in Los Angeles for quite some years and El Chullo has one of the best Saltados I've eaten. The fries were still crispy, the sauce was delicious and the chicken was cooked just right. One thing I wish they had was Aji sauce but outside that, this place is amazing!",

The sweet potato chips were soggy and the Aji de Gallina was pretty bland, needed salt and lacked flavor and spice.

Finally, today, we were able to make the time for lunch at El Chullo, and we were not disappointed.   The restaurant is small, maybe 8 tables and the bar area, but don't let that dissuade you from having a seat and noshing on some crunchy, salted Inca corn whilst you peruse the menu. The service is prompt and so warm and friendly, and we were seated and brought waters and the aforementioned snack immediately.  We started with the Papa Rellena, a large, egg-shaped doughy mashed potato ball, deep fried and filled with ground meat, eggs, olives, and raisins. Sounds like a wild combo, but it was amazing! It was rich and savory, with the occasional pop of sweetness from the raisins. The papa was served with the most OUTSTANDING lime-pickled red onion slices with cilantro. The punchy tang of the onions balanced out the richness of the papa rellena perfectly, and I found myself snacking on the slivers of goodness long after we had finished the potato cake.  For our entrees, hubby chose the Aji de Gallina, a super-rich dish of shredded chicken and potatoes in a creamy aji pepper sauce, served with steamed white rice. I had the Arroz con Pollo, arroz verde with a large chicken wing, corn, carrots, peas, and several soft chunks of potato(the latter smothered in the creamy aji sauce). Both of our dishes were exactly what we'd wanted, and mine was enhanced by those delectable pickled onions and a generous serving of a salty, tangy, spicy hot salsa the server provided me with.  Overall, this place is a gem. Absolutely wonderful, and we will be back again!",

    "text": "What a fun unique and quaint place.  We stopped in here after a game as we have always wanted to try it out. Has to be some of the best Peruvian food in the valley.  First of all the beer list is top notch. Yeah, they have some domestics, but I was highly impressed to see Kronenbourg 1664 on the list (at a $5 pop price) was super refreshing.  We started with the beef heart... tasted as good as it smelled and I mean this was marinated to a T. What was funny is one of the cooks when she placed it in front of us says \"so me and my brother have decided because that one turned out perfect that we are going to make one for ourselves now\" :). You know a place is tasty when the cooks turn around and eat what they are preparing... love that!  Side note... our kids are starting to branch out their pallets with us and when we came home we simply cut them each a bite (didn't tell them what it was) and they both fell in love. We mentioned afterward what it was and that didn't matter because they knew how delicious it was.  Another side note... if you have a dog with a pallet like ours, they go absolutely apeshit. Not that I know what giving someone crack is like, but the little dude was acting like he was on crack after the few nibbles we gave him. Wish we had a video.  Our next course was the aji de gallina. DEVINE and will leave it at that.  Couldn't have enjoyed this place more, from the food to the service to the beer selection at a reasonable price point.",

Thee stars only as I thought the staff was not the friendliest and the Sangria was mostly fruit juice and very little wine. The parking lot in front of restaurant is very small with very few spots so be ready to park in the neighborhood.   Ordered the Lomo Saltado, which essentially is slivers of beef with French fries. and while I thought was good, could have had more meat considering the price of $ 14.95 . El Chullo is not an inexpensive restaurant. A word of caution, the restaurant closes early on Sundays at 7 P.M so get there early.",

With that being I said I ordered my favorite shrimp chowder soup it taste nothing like the Peruvian food back home . My dad makes better shrimp chowder . They put peas and carrots . Gross. The menu says veggies , yes I probably should have asked what veggies but I didn't . I hate peas and I told the waiter if I could get something new I don't like peas . She argued with me and said it says on the menu it has peas then says well no it doesn't it says veggies . After I conversation she come back and says they will make you a new one with no peas. I didn't want a new one I just wanted something else but guess she ignored that . Any other professional restraunt satisfies the customer apologizes and takes the dish off the check and asks if there is anything they can do to compliment the customer . Anyways, I took my left overs for lunch today guess what I found a pea . They didn't make me a new bowl they sat there and took the peas out . I am very disappointed.",

Let me add, that in the Bay Area you have the gammit of delicious food options and even there a good Peruvian place was hard to find.  So we were super surprised that El Chullo met and exceeded our expectations.  1. The ceviche was fabulous! Good amount of acidity, well prepared seafood, and it had all the fixings (corn, sweet potato, onion, etc.) 2. We split an appetizer plate of 3 fixings and all of them were delicious!  The portions were proper size, and the prices were appropriate for the quality of food that was served!   We will defninitely be back again.   Lastly, we drove 30 minutes to get here and it was worth it!",

Can't remember the names of what I ordered but the appetizer was a thin sliced marinated fried potato. You eat them like potato chips but they are not dry and slightly crispy. The entree was a chicken breast, pan fried in a red pepper vinegar sauce with red onion slices. Very good! There was a small side of potatoes and a rather large pyramid of white rice. I love rice but I prefer it flavored. I almost asked for more red pepper vinegar sauce for the rice. It was similar to Japanese sticky rice. The place was small, clean, nice artwork on the walls, flat screen tv with Fox Spanish channel showing a soccer game. They have a full bar so we ordered a carafe of Sangria- iced, filled with what appeared to be fruit cocktail- very good and pared well with the meal. We ate the wine soaked fruit like a dessert. El Chullo has an air of authenticity about it and I most likely will go back in the future.",

Who I believe was one of the owners/main chef greeted us and explained it might be a while before we could order because they were so busy. She was so warm and kind and so was everyone else. My friend and I had a pisco maracuya (passion fruit pisco) and they were delicious. We also split a causa rellena, a cold mashed potato cake with a chicken filling, and the lomo saltado, a dish with beef tenderloin and french fries and rice.  Everything was really delicious and seasoned so well but next time I will probably opt for less starch in one meal.  I rated this five stars because I really couldn't get over how wonderful the overall experience was to talk with the Peruvian chef and feel somewhat like I was with family :). Also, this woman recommended the ceviche because it's prepared unique to Peruvian culture and I will say it looked amazing at someone else's table.",

This is not fine dining, it is a neighborhood place with as close to homemade latin food as you can get. I started with some yucca frittas which were great and came with two very tasty salsas. I had a chicken dish (forgot the name) with a red sauce that was slightly greasy but packed with flavor and delicious. My friend had the arroz con pollo which was also excellent. Crap even the iced tea was apparently homemade. The server was attentive and made us feel at home. The place doesn't look like much but it is a great place for well prepared Peruvian food at good prices. I will definitely go here again when I'm in town.",

It is a small restaurant and we went on a Friday evening (myself and another person) We were told we would have to sit at the bar because the tables for 4 people were being held for people of 3 or more. the bar is right at the front door so I didn't feel comfortable sitting there. I spotted an empty table for two near the window and asked if we could sit there. We would told yes (why she didn't ask us if we wanted that table in the beginning, I don't know). We were given menus and ordered our food with just water for beverage. It does take a while for the food to come but the portions are good and the food was delicious. I had the ESCABECHE DE POLLO (chicken garnished with sauteed red onion, aji amarillo, aji panca, & vinegar), my partner had the ARROZ CON POLLO (Cilantro based green rice with veggies, & chicken). The waitress never came back to refill our water or check on us. Customer service is big with me and even though the food was excellent, I'd have to rethink going back.",

    "text": "5 WELL-DESERVED STARS!!!! El Chullo is a small and unassuming hidden gem so we ended up passing it and having to turn around, but it was so worth it! Honestly, we had reservations and a Living Social deal at another Peruvian restaurant but ditched that place to come here because of the great Yelp reviews and SO GLAD WE DID! This place has both the best Peruvian food and the friendliest service of any Peruvian restaurant there has been in the valley for at least the last 20 years. We've tried them all (including some out of state) and by far this place has the best alfajores we've ever had- luscious creamy dulce de leche sandwiched between delicate creamy colored disks of flaky, buttery, goodness- oh my!  I'm still dreaming about them. The lucuma ice cream and chicha morada are also must tries. The chicha morada was refreshingly smooth and light- almost like a fine wine. We also had the appetizer sampler, the tamal, the aji de gallina, the jalea mixta, and the bistek and tallarines verdes. Next time we'll order the papa rellena and/or the yucca on their own (the sampler sizes were pretty small) and skip the tamal. The warm welcoming friendliness of the family/staff made our experience such an exceptional one that we ended up ordering a lot more than we planned and enjoying ourselves immensely. We love supporting family-owned businesses and Esperanza and Chef Omar and his cute sisters are so nice they make you want to come back again and again- well for them and the Alfajores :). I only wish it wasn't 30 mins. away, but so good it's worth the drive.",

I ordered the Aji de Gallina, and my boyfriend ordered the Ceviche. He was so blown away by the Ceviche that he wants to go back for it every weekend. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the appetizer. We ordered Yuca Frita, and it was a little over-fried for my taste.   Overall, it was a great dining experience. I am from Peru and felt like I was eating from my family's kitchen. I will mention that it ended up being a bit pricey, BUT it was worth it.",

I came to El Chullo on Peruvian Independence Day (July 28th) with my dad in order to celebrate. I ordered the lomo saltado and he ordered the cau cau. As much as I love my mom, I hate to say that this lomo saltado is just as good (maybe even a bit better - please don't tell her). I told my hubby that I have to take him here so that he can try it out for himself. I even loved their rocoto (hot peppered sauce) and I dipped my french fries in them. It was spicy...but a good spice.  I highly recommend this place if you want to try good Peruvian food!",

    "text": "Its a good sign when you feel explosively full after a meal and yet still wear a silly grin on your face.  Such was the case during my first visit to El Chullo. Admittedly I'm a novice when it comes to Peruvian cuisine so it was with some apprehension that I ventured here on a Saturday around Noon.  I had seen the great reviews this place was getting, but honestly had no idea what to order when I got there.  Fortunately my waitress helped guide me through it, and helped me make some delicious choices indeed.  As with so many Mom & Pop ethnic establishments in the Downtown Phoenix vicinity, the restaurant is a small space in an old building.  This space is on the northeast corner of 7th Street & Virginia, in between a barber shop and a convenience store.  There's barely any parking up front (though there were available spots when I arrived).  There is, fortunately, extra parking available in back (take the alleyway east of the convenience store and you'll run into a parking lot leading into El Chullo's back entrance).  The restaurant itself seats about 20-25 including the bar area.  When you walk in you immediately hear the Peruvian dance music in the background.  When I arrived just before Noon I was actually the only customer there, though the lunch crowd started streaming in shortly thereafter.    A quick FYI that from 10am-Noon on the weekends, they serve breakfast only.  It was close enough to Noon that they allowed me to go with the lunch menu instead, but just be aware of this if you're coming here on the weekend.  I started things off by ordering a traditional Pisco Sour.  Pisco is basically a type of Peruvian Brandy and a Sour is traditionally mixed with lime, syrup, bitters, and egg whites.  Wow, talk about refreshing.  There's enough alcohol to remind you its a cocktail, but truly a smooth, delicious, easy drinking cocktail perfect for any occasion.  For an appetizer I went with the Causa Rellena with crab filling (you can also choose a chicken filling).  Two potato cakes with crab filling and avocado in the middle, topped with a dusting of cilantro, half a hard boiled egg, and what I believe was a liquified sweet potato sauce.  Holy moly was this awesome.  It wasn't huge (maybe 3 inches in diameter & 3 inches tall), but remarkably rich and filling.  I'm not sure what type of potato they used for the potato cakes, but the texture was smoother than any potato I've had (maybe they used extra butter?).  And there was plenty of crab meat in there to be sure.  If you're coming here for the first time, get this.  I'm making it mandatory.  After the appetizer, I had no idea what I was doing, so I let the waitress pick the next two items for me.  For the main entree, she recommended trying one of the ceviches since this was my first time here.  I went with the Ceviche Mixto since that had a variety of seafood (though admittedly I didn't ask which kinds).  The seafood is garnished with onions and a spicy lime juice blend (you can get it super spicy, or go with a mild spice level as I did) and comes with sides of sweet potatoes, sweet corn, and cancha (basically dried corn).  Again, didn't look like a huge portion but they packed in a ton of seafood into this dish. In addition to the fish (which I believe was sea bass) there was lots of shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari, and octopus.  I'm not a huge fan of squid or octopus so I was a little apprehensive when I saw it, but actually this style tasted quite delicious.  All of the seafood tasted fresh and the lime sauce had the perfect amount of seasoning.  There's actually enough food in this dish to be split by two people, which probably explains why I felt pretty full after I finished.  Nevertheless, the waitress prodded me to try one of their desserts, so she had me try the Alfajor.  Two round flaky sugar cookies covered in powdered sugar with dulce de leche filling in the middle and chocolate sauce on the side.  I don't how in the world I had room for this, but I made it happen.  The dulce de leche was buttery smooth and the cookie cut with a fork.  An awesome, decadent conclusion.   Absolutely incredible meal.  The presentation, the flavors, and the variety was amazing.  They actually have a number of chicken and beef dishes to choose from as well, and I'll be sure to try those upon my next visit.  Total cost for this go around including the drink, appetizer, entree, dessert, tax and tip came to $50.  Worth every penny as El Chullo's cuisine could easily work as a fine dining experience (though I'm thrilled its just a neighborhood joint that I can wear my flip flops to).  I now see why Peruvian cuisine is quickly conquering American pallets, and El Chullo is Phoenix's ground zero.",

El Chullo is your spot! go here and you totally won't regret it one bit!!!!   ordered: *Lomo Saltado-YUM! flavorful. one of their most popular items at el chullo. i definitely didn't want to stop eating this! everything was very well seasoned and the beef strips were cooked perfectly. the tomatoes were very flavorful as well!  *arroz con pollo- this was recommended to me by the staff. which i thought was pretty good. the rice was flavorful and the sauce that came with it was very unique. for my first time having arroz con pollo i was definitely left with a good impression and would definitely try to order this at other peruvian places.   overall, staff is really nice. the bittersweet part about coming here is you're hungry you gotta wait quite awhile for your food because they make it fresh. it's like i like the idea of it being made fresh but the wait is long for the food. also they don't have the spicy dipping sauce i've had at other Peruvian food places that you eat with bread. they however give you these unpopped popcorn kernel thing that is lightly salted. personally i didn't care for it.    tips: *small front of store parking lot. *cash and credit cards accepted *they post a lot of their food on instagram *serves alcohol. *they have a few TVs. *indoor seating only.  *not super ideal for large parties since it's a small little mom and pops place.",

The causa rellena del pollo was unexpectedly light but savory and that mysterious yellow sauce is a triumph. Finally, the desserts - the Alfajor and Crema Volteada.

My girlfriend ordered another dish then changed her mind to the ceviche but I think there was a communication error and the waitress accidentally brought out the first dish. The waitress apologized and immediately brought out the ceviches. My girlfriend didn't really enjoy the ceviche. Either way, this restaurant is a great place to eat at in arizona and great customer service! Not many Peruvian restaurants in arizona but luckily this one does it right.",

I just got back from Peru and unfortunately they don't serve Cuy! Now that would be authentic! In any case, my foodie friends and I ordered individually but different dishes. I went with the Tallarin Saltado, a spaghetti like dish with beef. Overall, it was pretty solid. Salty and just a tad bit of spice, with the crunch of the raw onions giving this dish a savory bite!  However, my 2 favorites of the night were the beef heart and the fried rice! Beef heart anyone!? Yeah, it came a super spicy sauce you can add and when I say be careful.....BE CAREFUL! Youch! Spicy indeed, but the heart was so tender....uh yummy! The fried rice...I thought my mama made good fried rice; sorry mom! Overall, one of the best bite of fried rice I had in a while. It was a blend of Peruvian and Chinese style so I totally appreciate the fusion and so will you!  The service was spot on with our large group plus no mix up with our checks, which is totally awesome. The place is very tiny so be sure to make your reservations! - Enjoy!",

    "text": "Decided to treat my wife and one of her lady friends to something different. I've had this place bookmarked for ages and never seem to be in this area around eating time.  This is a really cool family owned and operated restaurant. The inside is very cozy and decorated with interesting Peruvian style artwork as well as several articles and \"Best of\" awards displayed proudly on the walls.  We came for the lunch service which starts at noon. The menu is loaded with a good variety of Peruvian favorites. It was tough to choose what we wanted and took advantage of the photos on Yelp to decide. The server was also most helpful and gave us a good idea on how it would taste.  We started with an appetizer plate that had a mixture of three different items. See my photo. The Papa Rellena was our favorite in the grouping. It is described as a golden-fried creamy potato dough stuffed with meat, eggs, raisins and olives and served with red onions marinated in lime juice. So good!  The ladies ordered a dish with Rice & Peruvian beans topped with a cilantro Beef stew called Frijoles con seco a la nortena. Yours truly ordered one called Escabeche de Pollo with a side of their spicy homemade Hot Sauce. It is pan fried Chicken garnished with sauteed red onion, aji amarillo, aji panca, & vinegar.  Both the food and service were spectacular. The wonderful and unique flavors of all the dishes are hard to describe and definitely something you will have to try. The service was very friendly and helpful. We even had the chance to talk to the chef and get a couple of top secret tips that she uses in her recipes.  This is not a very big place and the parking area is really small out front. They say there is also additional parking behind the restaurant with a back entrance when very busy.  Can't wait to eat here again and maybe even try recreating a couple recipes at home. This stuff is plate licking crazy good. Just try and restrain yourself and use a spoon. Simplemente Delicioso!  4.75 STARS",

My friends both agree that the food had no flavor other than salt.  This is the only Peruvian restaurant that I am aware of in the valley and I wanted so badly to like it but the food is just horrible and it is expensive - the bill came to over $100 for three of us.

My wife and I took our three kids and a cousin visiting from Venezuela. The adults had a carafe of white sangria and the kids had a Peruvian staple, chicha.  We had the appetizer platter, and chose fried yuca, causa rellena, and a Peruvian tamal. We ate every last ounce of food and sauce!  For our entrees, the kids had the tallarin and salchipapas, and the adults had ceviche and the mixed seafood platter. The ceviche was some of the best Peruvian ceviche we've had. The seafood platter was made up of deep fried fish, shrimp, calamari, and oysters. It was served with boiled potatoes and fried yuca.  Everything was great, and the service was awesome. The seafood platter was a little over cooked, but then again it's deep fried so what can you expect. We will definitely come back and bring our Peruvian neighbors to enjoy tasty authentic food they don't have to prepare themselves. :-)",

    "text": "I don't know where to begin, so let me say this - El Chullo's food is TO DIE FOR. A Peruvian friend had told us about the place two years ago, but somehow we got around to trying it only last night. It's a small, homey, family-run restaurant. The people running the place and running around the place are genuinely friendly, as if they've invited you to be a part of their home, food and lives.   We waited near the bar for about five minutes while our table of six was getting ready. I ordered a pisco sour which was amazing. Then there was the food. You know how a server walks past you with a plate of food that turns heads? That was happening with every single plate of food that came out of El Chullo's kitchen. Everything looked so delicious that it was hard to make up our minds about what to order.  I am a vegetarian, so I was pleased to see a vegetarian section on their menu. Our group ordered appetizer platters, fries, tacu tacu (vegetarian and seafood versions), ceviche, deep fried sea food platter, frijoles con seco a nortena, and the veggie version of peruvian-chinese fried rice.  OH. MY. GOD.  We worked on the installments of food for about two hours. Everyone shared, laughed and loved every single bit of it. Of course, I had to stick to vegetarian food but let me tell you, it wasn't a compromise at all. In fact, my meat-eating husband loved the veg tacu tacu and fried rice so much that we are still fighting about who gets to eat the leftovers.  The portion size of the entrees was BIG (I'm not sure what dish the guy, who says portions were small, ordered). Appetizers were just that, appetizers, so that you can save space for the delicious food. The food was spicy without being hot, not that we would have minded that. Pricing was reasonable and at par with other similar dining places. Parking is available in the back.  But wait! I forgot to tell you about dessert. Of course there's the delicious Leche Asada and Crema Volteada, but the husband ordered Alfajores, which is a layer of caramel between two cookies. I think we died and went to heaven because tasting that thing was an out of body experience.  It has been a while since our friend circle has come together and bonded over some delicious food. It has also been a while since we discovered a new cuisine. I now count Peruvian food and El Chullo among my favorites cuisines and restaurants.",

    "text": "I had the pleasure to go to El Chullo this morning for 'breakfast' (the quotes are because it was closer to lunch time and their breakfast foods are more like American lunch/dinner foods). This place is incredibly authentic. Our waiter (and possibly an owner?) is from a town just outside of Lima, so ya... pretty legit. The way their breakfast works is they have 3 choices that feed two people, each for 20$. The choices are chicharrones with a tamal, bread, and two coffees or a tenderloin sautee with bread and two coffees, or an egg dish with a tamal, bread and two coffees. We decided to get the tenderloin and add a tamal (cuz I wanted to try it). The tamal is large, delicious, and just like the ones I had when I was in Peru last summer... this is the real deal and very distinct from the typical Mexican tamale you may have elsewhere in Phoenix. The tamal has a little hard boiled egg (which obviously I ate and the husband didn't), some meat, some olives, and some hot peppers and served with an onion/citrus salad.... so good. I could just eat those tamals and be happy.  The tenderloin came in a sauce of sorts with onion and tomato and we ate it with the giant rolls given to us. The meat was soooo tender and flavorful. Their coffee was even good and we drank it black. The service is great. This place beats all of the other Peruvian restaurants that I have tried in town hands down and really took me back to when I was in Peru....like a little slice of vacation in my own neighborhood. I will certainly be back, I want to try dinner for sure and the chicharrones breakfast.... I think this place has serious 5 star potential, so we will see!",

    "text": "Positive:  Great service, friendly, genuine people. Family-owned and it shows.  Appetizers are awesome. Best I've had in a Peruvian restaurant in Arizona. The anticuchos are just right and ideally spiced, the ocopa was perfect, the papa rellena was delicious.  The spices and general flavor is authentic, rich and tasty.  There is a good variety of dishes, some of which you can't find elsewhere in Arizona.  Presentation is good, sides are well chosen. Portions are bigger than average for the entrees.  Lucuma ice cream tasted just like in Peru.  Not so good:  -Dishes are somewhat overpriced.    -The arroz con mariscos could use more seafood, more limon and more aji. It was too greasy and not spicy enough.  -Although the food was clean, and so were the napkins and silverware, there were a few bugs crawling on the floor. It's understandable. The weather is heating up. I just never saw that many in a restaurant. Some pest control would be a good idea.  Overall, I recommend this place for authentic Peruvian food and family ambience. It's cozy and fun. You just have to be choosy about what to order so it's worth the money and tastes good!",

    "text": "I am so in love with this little place! I have lived in the Coronado neighborhood about 5 years and have seen many things go in and out of this location...i have a feeling El Chullo will be sticking around. Everything i've had so far has been AMAZING. The Chupe De Camarones soup and Tacu Tacu De Marisco were seriously out of this world. The service is also excellent. They are so genuinely friendly and make you feel right at home. Can't say enough good stuff about this little gem...and i am beyond picky with restaurants, especially in Phoenix. It is the best restaurant on 7th st. by far in my opinion.",

    "text": "Excellent food with poor service. While bringing our pisco to the table, one of the waiters questioned the validity of my friend's Arizona driver's license (she is 26 years old). She said condescendingly \"Hmm I don't know if this is real because I don't want minors drinking here, but I'll give the drink to you this time\". She then proceeded to comment on how young I appear as well, even though I didn't order a drink (surprise, I'm also 26!). On top of that, the bottom of my friend's drink literally fell out of the glass while she was drinking. Her food, shirt, and belongings were covered in pisco sour. Instead of uttering a single word of apology, the same waiter commented on how \"this happens all the time\". Incredulous, I asked her if the bottoms of glasses commonly fall out in this restaurant. She responded \"oh no, I just assumed that she dropped it, the glass falling out has never happened before\". Needless to say, the food is good, but the waiter's patronizing behavior was unwelcome and reflects poorly on the potential of this restaurant. Will not be returning because of that reason. Tips to other young-appearing people who want to try this restaurant: Bring your passport if you want drinks!!",

    "text": "Food was delicious!!!  Authentic!!!  Restaurant seems to be worked by the family that owns it. The sons who basically does everything except cook, is very personable and has great people skills. His mother is sweet but does not speak English. If you go when it is busy be prepared to wait. What they need to do is designate each one in the family a duty. Son waits tables, mother gets waters and canchitas, father clears and sets tables and helps with bringing out food. Anyways if you have time it is definitely worth the wait. We will go back for sure!!  Oh and the pisco sours are awesome!! Along with the anticuchos and aji de gallina. Yum",
