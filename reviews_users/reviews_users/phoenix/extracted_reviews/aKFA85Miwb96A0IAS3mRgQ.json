    "text": "Fez is a charming, quirky eclectic little restaurant that seems to do everything right. The wait staff are young, tattooed, 'interesting' and very good at their jobs. Our waitress, Candace, was one of the best servers I've seen in awhile. She was friendly, gave great recommendations and after my husband asked for '399' olives in his Gin Martini, she brought a whole spear's worth plus extra. I had a Kentucky Mule (not their name for it) and it was wonderful. The menu is extensive with something for everyone. I ordered the curry with shrimp ( you have an option of 4 or 8- 4 shrimp are plenty) and it was absolutely delicious. My husband ordered a beef dish that was tender and nicely seasoned. Service was great- we never needed to ask for water or anything. My friend had wine and the pours were generous. Good beer and spirits selection. We ordered Tiramasu for dessert and it was probably the weakest link- kind of ice creamy and not enough cocoa. Not bad- just not as good as the rest of the meal. For old folks from Chandler it was great to go to a young hip restaurant that has old school class and well trained staff. Special thanks to Candace for making it a great night- we'll be back. PS- she should get a raise- a great face for the restaurant.",

    "text": "I've been a fan but tonight I was unimpressed. We got the bruschetta to begin and one of the varieties was supposed to be dates, nuts, and mascarpone. What we got had a very sweet, pink cream, almost like strawberry cream cheese. It was way too sweet and tasted weird. No where in the menu does it say a berry mascarpone, so that was strange. I've had the bruschetta before with the mascarpone and it was quite different, much lighter.  The mozarella on the other variety was very good though. Then we got the spice road chicken to split, with fries, which comes out to about  $16 when you count the charge for a split plate and adding fries. That's fine, we knew about it from reading the menu. The fries are sup par, nothing to rave about, and not worth the upcharge. I was looking forward to trying something new, but was disappointed. our sandwich had deep fried slices of chicken no thicker than 1/2 cm. I'm not kidding! I've never seen chicken sliced that thin. It was like they took a deli slice and deep fried it. It was certainly not worth the money. I wouldn't have paid more tab  $7 for what we got.  We mentioned our concerns and the waiters response was \"well its deep fried\". He was quite sassy and seemed offended at first. I hate sending things back! It is not something I do frequently and the response we were given made me feel very guilty, but the fact of the matter is there was just no meat on that sandwich! They did offer to get us a different item, we requested to get the fez burger instead and that was decent, not nearly as good as the old location. We have been long time supporters, my boyfriend and I, but we are noticing that the quality is declining. For as much as the meals cost, we hope you improve soon! We won't be returning for a while.",

We asked twice what the hold up was with the chips, at which the server said it just takes some time to prepare them.  Bottom Line---Great Food, Super Slow Service.",

The bar back and food runner was more attentive than the bar tender.  I got drinks on a, I'll help you when I can help you basis, but the order wasn't what I ordered at all. A professional restaurant would have a drinks bartender and a bar bartender on staff- no excuses! This is FEZ management and ownership's problem.  I also asked about the wifi, which wasn't working (to be refreshed) and in over an hour no one helped me. The bartender looked closely at the problem and assured that he'd get someone to refresh the non-existent network. DON'T EXPECT TO DO ANY KIND OF WORK, WORK FUNCTION, OR EVENT NEEDING WI-FI HERE!  Things would be cool if in an hour he even acknowledged there's nothing that could be done. As for my meal- I let them know it wasn't what I ordered or expected and was told \"maybe just consider this your cheat day.\" Really?   This place is supposed to be \"Gay owned and operated\" but they have no restaurant class... haha. Ya'd think they at least have restaurant class. 1 Star Review which is rare for me!!!!  I haven't seen any gay owners inside here in my visits. It is centrally located, sure! But much better choices within walking distance before you walk into this place.   #ShitofPhoenix  #don'tgohere  #phoenix  #gayresturant \"quote\"  #shittyplaces  #terribleAz  #",

Our waitress was very helpful and went through the entire menu describing her favorite dishes to us.   We got a plate of nachos for the table, some rosemary fries and sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries came with an apricot aioli sauce, and it was fantastic!  For the main entree I got a hummus burger (can't recall the actual menu name). The burger itself was tasty, but could have used some more seasoning. Possibly salt? Other than the that it was very tasty.  For dessert I had a chocolate martini, and it's probably one of the best I've had.   The only \"complaint\", and I use that word lightly, would be waiting for our server. The restaurant wasn't very busy, but it still took forever to get refills on water. It looked like she was the only waitress working, so it wasn't her fault I'm sure.   If you're looking for a hip and trendy place that supports the local restaurant and bar scene, Fez is the place to go!",

First I took it as just being busy, but when your waiter takes your water drink and never come back that's not busy.  This is a business and you should all have on goal making sure everyone is served.  When yo can fill different table drinks and not once acknowledge, the table in the back when clearly you see no drinks, or food on the table just how you took time to pick plates until off a table, you're could have come over and at least say sorry have you been help, give me one moment and I'll be right with you. Mind you the original waiter is at the bar talking.  we have now been here 20mins with two kids at the table, my brother had to get up to find out what was going on. Just to be told one moment, just so you can help the next guess coming in mind you we have been here for 20 mins. So we just left just in time for our waiter to realize he forgot his table.",

    "text": "I used to go to FEZ at its old location years ago. Back then it was much better. I thought they went out of business and then I happened to be driving on Central and saw the new location. So happy to see it, I decided to grab some lunch to go.  My favorite has always been the FEZ burger. I placed my order and waited, pretty much ignored by the female bartender. I got my food and left.   Very disappointed in the quality. One of the things that makes this burger so good is the pears they put on it, plus the feta and sauce and onion strings. Well.....one side of the two pieces had no pears and the other side had a small piece. On top of that, the burger was super dry and just overall not very tasty.    What makes this all the more maddening is the extreme prices at FEZ. That dry burger was $15 with tax!  Way more in cost then it used to be.  Oh yes and it comes with a side salad?!  Hello, how about some normal fries with my burger. Oh yeah, you can get that for another $2.50!!  I'm sorry but I'm not paying $17 or $18 dollars for a so so, not that huge portion burger. Hello FEZ owners - I'm not rich by any means.  I'm there to support your business and hopefully get a good quality meal like I used to get.  On the positive side - the new location seems nice but I liked the old one too. The bar is probably the best part. This cool sort of octagon shape with a thick granite top (at least I think it was granite).  Considering the difficulty of getting to this location, parking, expensive pricing and sub par quality - I won't be going back.  I'm tempted to call and ask for my hard earned money back for the disappointing meal.  Eat at your own risk",

    "text": "This place is actually pretty amazing. It reminds me of a place in NYC called Elmo... the decor is pretty chik and modern, the food is pretty great and the drinks are interesting. staff is pretty nice (so is everyone in Phoenix apparently)!  We walked in and even though the place was pretty packed, we were able to be seated in the first 2-3 min. the host was pretty awesome and our waiter was ... hot, professional, and very happy to serve us even though he had been working all day. After sharing the daily specials... I decided to move away from my regular margarita drinks and just have the rose sangria with grapefruit. It was ok... honestly, a bit too sweet for my taste, but as a sangria it was strong and interesting and beautifully presented.  As an entree, we ordered a small spinach and lamb Pizza, beef nachos and a chicken cutlet sandwich. My main entree was the nachos. If it weren't for the chicken sandwich, I'd likely had given Fez a lower review... but let's focus on what I had first... the nachos.... too many nachos and not enough cheese or toppings. The guacamole was ok, but should have had a bit more acidity, the sour cream was heavy and thick... I did not touch the red sauce as I am never a bit fan, but it seemed chunky and decent.... my biggest problem is that I ended up with so many nachos with no cheese or any topping on top... there was also a bath of greasy red liquid at the bottom from the beef which made the bottom nachos soggy. Now, the really good part of the meal was the one bite I got from my friends chicken sandwich... I mean seriously  amazing! I think it was called the taz-taz sand which or something... but OMG... the chicken was crispy and moist and double stacked for a high sandwich, the cheese spread added a creamy texture.... the ciabatta bread on additional crunchiness... this sandwich was likely one of my top 10 chicken sandwiches of my life...  Let me say this very honestly... even with the very nice staff and ambiance.... had it not been for this sandwich... I'd likely would say this place is good, but. It enough to bring me back as a regular... that sandwich, well, made me feel like I should come back for it many times more, but also that I should try other options in their menu.  All in all, this is likely a third date type restaurant... it is not noisy, but packed and while nice, it just feels like not the impress me type place considering the food menu pretty much reflects a high end glorified diner.",

There is a dramatic central bar, with the iconic Fez chandelier. There is patio and dining room seating, and they even have a little side sofa area to hangout. (see pics)  THE DRINKS  The drinks were creative and delicious.  I tried the watermelon press. (see pics)  THE MENU   The food was outstanding.  The menu includes:  Soups: Cumin Cinnamon Carrot Tomato Lentil  Appetizers: Fez Fries Chicken Strips a la Fez Fez Baja Tacos Gyro Bowl Fez Nachos Fez Lettuce Wraps Kisra & Hummus (which I had - see pics) Nazari Calamari (which I had - see pics) Lamb Sliders Chicken Phyllo Salerno Bruschetta Plate  Salads Burgers Sandwiches  Entrees: Turkish Mezze Plate Mediterranean Tilapia Bacon Mushroom Bistro Steak London Bistro Steak Arroz Con Pollo Fez Golden Curry (which I had - see pics) Go Green Pasta Pasta Con Spago Alla Norma  Daily Desserts  Creative Signature Martinis & Cocktails Wine List: Modest But Original (glass/bottle)   Unfortunately, the coffee was served with spoiled creamer, but it was quickly fixed, so no big deal.  CONCLUSION   5/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE  *My only complaint is that the parking is confusing and limited.   *Hours:  Mon - Thur 11am - 12am Fri/Sat 11am - 1am  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FFezOnCentral.com&s=d66b6169143841a7fbe50fd2d97ea44f6a1d6038fc503857a64bc19c29ed57be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">FezOnCentral.com</a>",

Fez's Happy Hour is one of the best values. Get any kind of signature margarita for $4. I ordered the apricot margarita and it was really good. Also on the happy hour menu was a gyro bowl, which is basically a salad with gyro meat in it. It was tasty. I also ordered the Spiced Peach Manhattan and let me tell you, that drink will knock your socks off. It was very strong. No wonder it cost $12.95, the ingredients are red stag spiced cinnamon whiskey, peach liqueur, lemon & orange juices, lemon bitters. Very much worth the price. All in all this is one of my favorite places to go for Happy Hour after work.",

    "text": "Based on FEZ's customer service/management, they are truly a disaster. Earlier this week, FEZ mocked another Yelp reviewer by posting their profile (not their review), and encouraging their Facebook fans to join in on the joke. (The customer simply mentioned that she wished they used natural juices in their cocktails, but had commented on the former FEZ profile that it was \"a nice place\".) Unfortunately for them, many customers did not support this post, and responded accordingly. The manager, who identified himself on Facebook as Tom, proceeded to publicly attack those who disagreed with the post. About one customer, he posted that they were rude during their visit. He told others that they didn't know what they were talking about, and eventually deleted comments/blocked users if they didn't agree with him. After attacking many of their loyal customers online, someone at FEZ finally deleted the entire post. Perhaps someone had one-too-many of those cocktails without natural juices?  If I'm being honest, the food at FEZ isn't terrible (brunch is okay) and many of the servers are friendly enough. The food and service isn't better than anywhere else, so I'd recommend supporting a business that respects their guests more.",

I was excited to try the new location last Saturday night after walking around downtown with all of the Super Bowl festivities, dance parties and general fun going on. We were hungry and it was about 9:30pm. We entered Fez's new location, and it was gorgeous! The decor is very cool and modern. We were seated on their beautiful patio, which has individual heaters over many of the tables.... nice touch. This is where things went south. We sat and waited....and waited.... and waited. A table next to us literally got drinks, ordered a dessert, ate a dessert, and paid and we STILL hadn't gotten any attention.... no one came by to give us even water. It was like we were invisible. And don't be fooled, they were not slammed.... the patio was maybe half full and had two servers working it. After waiting and trying to get the attention of one of the waiters, we decided to leave... obviously they didn't want our business. We walked out with one of the waiters from the patio who had no idea that we hadn't had any service at all and still didn't acknowledge us. This was too bad because I really like the food at Fez (at least at the old location, didn't taste anything here). This makes me think twice about coming back here.",

    "text": "Okay, so it sounds like everyone loves fez, it's a nice neighborhood / hip city restaurant that many go to especially on the weekend. Have been to the old fez but never to the new one. So was excited to try it out. Location was amazing, decor, set up and cleanliness was beautiful. Staff was very nice, however I felt that they either were over worked or understaffed the day we got there. Good people, great attitude, just not as attentive as I'd thought they'd be. May be because it's such a laid back / popular place, they kind of let loose. We were a group of 5 and we went for brunch, 2 out of the group shared a burger. I got the Baja breakfast (added chicken to it), my other friend got the golden curry egg scramble, and I can't recall what  my fifth friend had. We also ordered feta fries and regular salt and pepper fries and a bottle of champagne and OJ.   I'm only critiquing my good but along the way I'll explain some miss-haps that could have easily been prevented.   Server was polite and nice, we get our food. Mine looked great (Baja breakfast) and my friend who ordered the golden curry scramble got her plate and had a look of confusion on her face. Once the food was all on the table, she asked me \"didn't it say \"Scramble\" on the menu?\" The dish she got had 2 fried eggs. No problem, as the gentleman who brought the food was still there we told him and he said \"they're supposed to ask how you'd like the eggs\" my friend said that no one asked us. Since the new is listed  \"scrambled\" on the menu, it is expected to come out that way j less customer asks to have it differently. Just sayin!!!  Then I noticed my dish didn't have chicken with it and as I was about to say something the gentleman bringing the food set a plate of chicken next to my plate saying that he'd just saw it and apologized.   All was good, food tasted amazing (we were super hungry after a charity walk downtown Phoenix). The fries were very well made and my meal (Baja breakfast) was delicious. Now we're done, and been seated for a while, no one has approached. Our server has. It been seen for a while. We get the attention of another server, ask for our bill and a few minutes our server shows up, with the bill.   So in conclusion, I'll definitely go back, and try other dishes. I love the city vibe there, and the people working there, they just gotta pick it up a little and be more attentive to customers.",

And my wife had the gyro pita and said it was the best she's ever had.  I don't know what else to say other than YUM!",

We will definitely be back to check out the brunch. I saw a lot of things on the menu that I would like to try like the lamb sliders and hummus. Last but not least, our waiter Devin, was amazing. He knew the menu and knew exactly what to recommend. Thanks Devin!",

    "text": "This place is awesome!! It is such a welcoming restaurant with friendly staff. My boyfriend has talked highly of the food here for quite some time now so we finally came here for brunch on Sunday. He had never been to the new location so it has been a long time. Let me tell you, the menu is super eclectic, overly creative and wants you to come back to try more of their awesome put together dishes.  The staff, first of all was super friendly and welcoming. We sat at the bar (as we always do wherever we go) and the bartenders and manager were all very nice.  My boyfriend has boasted of this \"FEZ burger\" for quite time so he obviously ordered it, and subbed salt and pepper fries as the side. So dang good! The pears, the molasses sauce, the bun...heaven on a piece of colorful ceramic that matched the eclectic atmosphere.  I got the chicken pita, sub lettuce for pita, lol. It was excellent! I loved the pomegranate sauce and the dried fruits! Chicken was cooked perfectly and the grill/char flavor was present which I love. The side salad in the lemon herb dressing was great too! I loved the rainbow carrot diced in thin shreds on top.  We also got the drinks...I ordered the jalapeno Bloody Mary, so good, I also had the G-Spot drink, at only five bucks each, not only a great deal but great drinks!  We will be back, it was an excellent dining experience and the parking is actually really easy :)",

Been here multiple times now and every single time the place just crushes it. The outdoor patio is dog friendly - bring them puppies ! There is ample parking in the parking structure adjacent to the building, its name escapes me and so that is always a plus. Best part, happy hour at a reasonable time. From 3:30-6:30 pm & 11:00pm-close ! Yaas ! And not to forget the best darn veggie burger in town with a delicious goat cheese spread. Pure heaven !   Here is the best part about fez for which I will willingly overlook most things - they are very involved in the community and they are very socially forward thinking which means I will gladly wait for that nth martini on tini tuesdays !",

    "text": "I visited Fez with a few girlfriends during my time in Phoenix this past March, and I was actually pleasantly surprised by both the food and the service.  First of all, the bar itself is beautiful. One thing I really appreciated about the design is that the bar is actually a circle rather than just a long straight counter like most bars. This set-up was perfect for chatting with friends; we were still able to chat even if we weren't sitting right next to each other! The menu itself is pretty unique - this isn't just basic bar food. We shared a couple of different appetizers. Notable options are the Fez lettuce wraps and the Fez fries. The lettuce wraps were probably my favorite: the dried pears were a nice touch, and overall I felt they were both healthy and delicious! For the Fez fries, we got a combination basket of the cinnamon dusted sweet potato fries and the salt and pepper fries. Both were extremely tasty and addictive. I'm a fan!  In addition, the bartenders were absolutely wonderful and they even gave me a complimentary chocolate brownie with ice cream for my birthday. It was probably one of the best brownies I've had in a long time. If I ever get a chance to venture back to Phoenix, you can bet I'll definitely be back to Fez!",

I remember everything I had before was SO good.  From burger, mac and cheese, pizza, and brunch.  We were sat in the patio at the smallest table they can find (fits 2 people), then other parties of two came later got to sit at a table for 4.  I ordered the romana pasta with chicken:  classic creamy parmesan & garlic sauce with penne pasta served w/garlic bread adding grilled chicken.  It was just OK.  The garlic and rosemary fries were the best thing out of the whole meal.  Just was not how it was at the old location and with Thomas still there.",

One of my worst nightmares is getting my burger well done when I ordered it medium. *sad face* Unfortunately, I ordered it as take out, so by the time I got home, I was too hungry to even complain.

I'll definitely refrain from spending my money on anything that has his name on it.   1/14/2015: The owner has been fighting with everyone on their facebook page, claiming that we were rude to them on opening night when they pushed us to the patio ~it was freezing cold and already had made the reservation! Let me put here what I wrote earlier back to him:  Rude treatment\"? Really? I was there that night. I've pictures to prove. Will be posting shortly. When we were froze to death! Ask server to move people who were standing on top of our heads and smoking in a \"non-smoking\" area and she said they would still smoke!!! Ordered food that supposed to have chicken and order got messed up. No apology and RUDELY he brought some grilled chicken in a separate plate after 15 minutes and told me here's your chicken. Allowing people to smoke in a non smoking section is definitely something you should train your staff to STOP not to encourage!!! Pictures worth 1000 words~ here Ya go!!!",

The staff was friendly and our waiter was nice, but we can't get over the outrageous pricing for two HALF sized salads. We both ordered the FEZ 1/2 salad. I ordered mine with grilled chicken and he ordered his with salmon and avocado. On the menu it DOES list that avocado is a $2.25 up-charge which we were ok with. The meats were all listed to be \"market prices.\"  We received our salads and were quite disappointed. The food itself did taste great. But definitely not worth the money. For $2.25 you get 5-6 slices of avocado, you can buy a whole one at Safeway for $1. But the worst part was out total bill for two 1/2 salads and only water to drink was $39 with tip! Outrageous!!",

I lived walking distance from the old location so I guess I'm a bit biased, but driving down seems like such a chore after being spoiled with a quick walk.  There parking garage is easy to access and it's a quick 2 minute walk to Fez. That being said, I think the new seating is uncomfortable. Any empty table had a reserved sign, so we sat at the bar. The stools are modern and look very cool, but there's no back support and it just felt a little weird.  Food was still good. If you're new to Fez, try the Fez burger with sweet potato fries, the Fez fit plate, or the arroz con pollo. Service wasn't as good, though. My water was never refilled and it took a long time to get to go boxes and our check.  I'll be back because i like the food and it's still pretty close to me, but probably not as frequently.",

And we're talking about mediocre meaning it ACTUALLY tasted like defrosted frozen meals. Edible, you'll finish it because you paid for it, but you leave slightly ticked off because you had such high expectations that were not fulfilled.   The atmosphere was very Scottsdale. Personally, not a fan (which is why I live downtown Phoenix), but I guess it's good that there's an establishment that caters to all types of people. Think loud club-type music on a Sunday morning and a modern-retro vibe that comes off almost kitschy.   Probably won't be coming back to this place since there are other amazing dining options within walking distance.....",

    "text": "Something about the new place reminds me of the Ikea dining area. Fez is open, clean, efficient... but lacks warmth. I feel rushed here, like I'm in the way. The bar area is large and looks great, but tends to get incredibly loud no matter what time of day. 3pm on a Thursday and it was impossible not to yell in order to hold a conversation, no matter where you're seated inside.  I've noticed some of the other reviews knocking Fez for moving farther away from them. This is absurd, guys. It's 2 miles south on the exact same road, and it's still off the lightrail. A restaurant doesn't need to consider every patron's home address before relocating and it's unfair to dock review points based on this.   That said... it's now incredibly close and convenient for me so I will definitely be back.  Last night (1/14/15) the Fez Facebook page posted a link to a 1 star Yelp review pointing out that, contradictory to the reviewer's belief, they DO use fresh ingredients in their cocktails. The initial post didn't mock her or seem to have any outright ill intent, but the comments quickly became catty and immature and the post was removed. Whether this was meant to make fun of the reviewer or not, posting it on Facebook was seriously in poor taste when the option to reply directly exists right here on Yelp.",

    "text": "\"So......Fex moved.\" I had to be unfortunate bearer of bad news. Jenny was a Fez fan and, in her defense, the new location is a bit less convenient for us. While my biggest question mark was how they planned to address parking, I have no problem with the couple extra miles biking down Central we'd have to put in to get there.  To second the other reviews, Fez does seem more 'bar-ish' this time around and I'm not sure if it is intentional. The bar is larger and isn't partitioned off as it had been before. I also visited on the evening when many of the tables were marked reserved but not occupied during the entirety of my visit. Still, the food and drinks were as good as expected and the service was good.   I'll hold out an incomplete for the time being. It was their first week at the new location so I'm not ready to write it off just yet. But, rest assured, this isn't going to be your father's Fez.",

However our experience when we stopped in for dinner and cocktails on 07/10  @ 8:00 was shocking.  Restaurant  was full so we said we'd sit at the bar instead of waiting for a table. Asked the hostess if she could ask a patron to scoot over who was sitting in the middle of two empty seats (3seats total) She said \"No, that's not my job\" my reply \"but your a hostess\" she said \" No, I am a waitress\".  So Instead I gave her my name for a table, and as she walked away she said \"your such an asshole\" I said excuse me, she said \"your an asshole\" and she went off.. I asked for the manager, she refused to get him, asked for her name she refused to provide it.  (black lipstick makes her easy to identify) Asked another employee for the manger and finally made contact. He was apologetic and genuine, offered to comp a meal but we left and went to Match across the street which was delightful. Never have I been called an \"asshole\" for simply requesting a seat so I can give a business my money.",

Loud music, plus the acoustics made all the talking combine into a racket of its own. Our server was... odd. I can't put my finger on it. He seemed pretentious in his own way. He never addressed me, but spoke to my fiance the entire time.   Got the Fez burger and the Tangier burger. Both were cold. There was a long list of delicious sounding things that were supposedly on them, but they all must have either been not there in adequate amounts, or just mixed together, because the Fez just tasted like a cold burger on a ciabatta bun, and the Tangier tasted like a cold burger on a ciabatta bun (with pesto).   You don't get fries; those are an extra $3; you get a 'salad' which is just carrots, lettuce and arugula. The lemon basil dressing was really good, but most of my greens had nasty black spots.. only half was edible.   We didn't send anything back as we were in a hurry and I didn't feel like arguing with managers.  Total for 2 burgers, one with added fries and $3 for added bacon, was $34. That's pretty pricey, especially considering the state of the food.   I think this is one of those places that isn't very good, but it's popular and pricey (so it must be good!), and you want to fit with the hipster crowd, so you pretend to love it and go there all the time.",

Every single waiter/waitress we've ever had has been not only enthusiastic but genuinely knowledgable about the food and drink menu in detail.   I love restaurants that serve an interesting, progressive meal (start to finish) without feeling too \"out there\" and unrelatable.   FEZ, don't change a thing!  p.s. They have a thing about sauces. All I can say is, try them all.",

    "text": "Now, I've been coming to Fez for a few years and have had a wonderful experience each and every time until last night.  A couple of friends and I went out for dinner and drinks, last night, food was great, as always, and we had an amazing waiter, they were very attentive (they filled up my ice water without me noticing and a second time before my glass was empty). Now, my friends and I were so caught up in catching up that one of my friends forgot to leave a tip (which, by the way, is not like them). So, our night came to an end and we left and as we were walking back to our vehicles, our waiter runs to us and I assumed it was because one of us forgot our card, but no, they came up to my friend and gave them their receipt and said \"were you not going to leave a tip?\" We were all thrown off, and my friend asked if they had a pen and they just said \"no\" and walked off. Now, at this time, we're startled. Fez is one of my favorite restaurants in town, I had my birthday dinner there and I've never experienced anything so unprofessional before. We understand the value of a tip but for someone to leave their establishment, run after us and rudely question us about a tip is unacceptable and very unprofessional. Because of that, my friend returned the receipt without leaving a tip (mind you, we just had a drink), and we continued on our way and then the waiter runs out after us AGAIN and tells, no, not tells, they yell at my friends and tells them that they're not welcome back to Fez ever again. Some words were exchanged and it all finally came to an end.The waiter didn't have an issue with me because I'm a regular and they said that I was welcomed back but my friends weren't. Again, Fez is one of my favorite places to eat, I've recommended it to friends, even to visitors looking for a fun place to enjoy a drink or food, but after the experience that happen last night, I'm not very eager to go back. Now, I think this whole thing could've been resolved or handled better if the waiter was more polite and professional, as they were when they were serving us.  All in all, I've been to Fez numerous times and this is the only bad experience I have had but it definitely did leave an impression on me.",

Decent food and ok drinks, certainly nothing worth 5 stars except their VERY pretty wallpaper.  Strange and unappealing menu. Reading it had the effect of making me Google the nearest In and Out Burger and wish I'd parked closer. I tried the lamb sliders. Tasty meat but way too greasy with little else but some pita scraps on the plate,  I can still taste them in my throat a day later.   Decor was pretty. Staff was quite friendly and very attentive. One woman bartender had the disgusting habit of playing with her hair a lot then coughing into her hand then serving every martini with her dirty fingers resting on the top of the rim of the glass. We watched her do it with literally every martini she made, all night, on $5 martini night. If you go in, make sure to order from the bartender with purple hair who was wonderful and kept her fingers and germs off all the rims.  Located in a vapid master-planned Disney Park version of a hipster-hood, complete with 1 deranged mental patient screaming to himself on the corner for authenticity. Would have given Fez 3 stars for trying (and for their wallpaper) except for the unsanitary mixology habits of bartender #1.",

He then proceeded to order a bunch of drinks then left us with the check! It is safe to say ten years later I have had much better experiences here lol. I live walking distance away so Fez has become a frequent spot for the bf and I to sit on the patio and have a drink (or four). Service is always friendly and prompt and the people watching is top notch. I've been known to order the Feta Fries a time or two with their lemon vinaigrette instead of ranch for two reasons: 1. I pretend it's healthier 2. It's tangy and delicious! I'm also a huge fan of their Golden Curry {coconut yellow curry | zucchini | carrots | peppers | Basmati rice} and I'll add chicken or shrimp for some extra protein.",

We got the fez feta fries, calamari and chicken phyllo packets for the table. They got our order mixed up and accidentally brought us an order of their hummus, when we told them we didn't order it they ended up just giving it to us while our phyllo packets were cooking. The hummus was actually really good! The chicken phyllo packets were delicious with their dipping sauce and the fries are a good guilty pleasure, topped with bacon, ranch, feta and green onion. What's not to love? Calamari was also a solid choice. For my main course I got the caprese kisra, it had good flavor but wasn't anything too special. It reminded me of a pizza I've had at pita jungle. Overall, Fez is a good spot for late night eats. I got a Pomtini (pomegranate vodka with pomegranate infusion), it was pretty strong so you get a punch for your money but I would have preferred a stronger pomegranate flavor.",

I popped in today on my way to the airport and was incredibly disappointed with the shell of it's former self I encountered.  What used to be a Moraccan gem was now a basic burger joint with superficial \"middle eastern\" style. We waited over 30min after ordering to receive hummus so salty is was unpleasant and a honey shrimp dish that was so soaked in an ultra sweet , syrupy sauce that the majority of the rice and some of the vegetables tasted like the bottom of a panda express trough.  I'll be on the lookout for a new place next time!",

Please order this you won't be disappointed. Every bite was heavenly. Burgers were on ciabatta bread and they were the perfect plate to share.

The hostess was completely rude from the time we walked in the door to the time we left. She rolled her eyes because I had a big group and we wanted to sit outside after she tried to squeeze us at a small table. THEN When Samuel was kindly taking our order the same rude hostess/ waitress rudely interrupted Samuel and complained in front of us (the customers) that there was another table and they had been waiting a long time to be served, which Samuel thought we were his last table. She should have pulled him aside and told him in private, but she decided to embarrass him in front of his customers. Other than that the drinks and food was awesome! Loved the bartender as well! Thank you Samuel for making our experience so much fun!!!!",

When she did come around, she would ask part of our group personally is they needed anything, the rest of us had to call her back so we could order.  When our dinners arrived, 4 out of 5 of our order were incorrect. They took our food back to the kitchen to talk to the chef. They returned with our same plates after several minutes stating that their menu had changed since moving from their old location.  We pointed out that their printed menu didn't match the food that was brought to us. By this time our food was completely cold.   We kept the food, howbeit cold by this time, to avoid further problems. They, then, completely avoided our table until they brought the check before asking if there was anything else that we needed. Poor form in general!  To their credit, however, they did credit 50% of each of our food tickets and, in my case, did credit the glass of wine I had.   It was just an unfortunate experience. If they were a new restaurant, one could forgive such service and chalk it up to learning and growing pains. This is not a new restaurant, however, and the food and service was much better at their former location.  It's unlikely I'll return.",

This past Sunday we decided to go to FEZ for some yummy food, a brunch cocktail and to check out thier patio.   This location is much larger than the previous FEZ location and was not very crowded at all. We did get there very early, probably 10/ 1030ish on a Sunday. We decided to go sit out on the patio to enjoy the weather. The patio is nice and was clean. The only part that was a little odd were some random people out on the street that wanted to gawk at us while we ate. We ended up moving away from the seating along the edge (not due to the random people outside, but the sun) and that seemed to fix the situation.   The wait staff was GREAT! The offered to move us because they noticed my mom was not comfortabe in the sun. Also, my daughter stained my dress with some fruit and the waiter brought me some club soda so it would not set (and it did not), so I am very grateful of his thoughtfulness.   The food did not disappoint. I had a mimosa an it was delish, cold, not too much OJ and the OJ was slightly pulpy and sweet..PERFECT! I had the small fruit and cheese board that came with a fresh moz, creamy brie and a fantastic savory and sharp goat cheese. There was also toasted herb kisra, however I will likely ask for toasted baguette next time instead, grapes, green apples, strawberries and the most amazing garbazos! The chickpeas tasted like they had been flash fried and then well seasoned with salt, pepper, chili powder and maybe some paprika. They were crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle--very addictive! The rest of the crew enjoyed the coffee very much and had pancakes (looked ok, but not impressive), eggs (which my daughter, shes one and a half and LOVED the eggs, she literally clapped when we gave her a seconf helping) they looked fluffy and were obviously seasoned with salt and pepper, ham, bacon, potatoes and yummy toasted baguette with olive oil.   We were all happy with our food and will be back! Check them out!   Brunch time! Specials $4 mimosas or $15 for a bottle plus OJ. Yum!",

The service was amazing and my lunch partner who ordered the same thing but added shrimp to his salad enjoyed every bite! The restaurant was not crowded and yet it had enough people dining to give it a nice atmosphere. As this is very close to my office I will be back in the near future to try other items !!!",

There was a roach crawling behind my back and my friend spotted it as the food was coming out I was grossed out. I was surprised they didn't apologize instead, they just killed the roach and asked if we wanted to move seats. I wanted to leave but my friend wanted to give it a try. We stayed and moved to a new seat. The food was decent. Would I eat there again? I am not sure. I am a little leary about it the restaurant has roaches. If it wasn't for the roach I would eat there regularly and refer more people. The roaches made it uneasy for me.",

Mondays are also Margarita Mondays which mean $6 dollar Margaritas. That was the complete highlight of my visit to Fez! The watermelon & mango margaritas are to dieeeeee for!!!

I ordered the balsamic blue cheese burger cooked medium ... My burger was awful. The meat was very red and mushy and the bun was a struggle to even bite into. I was going to send it back but my friend insisted I just try and eat it. So I tried, but it was just too raw. Our server was great and said she would ask them to fix it. Seemed like they just stuck the burger patty in the microwave and put it back on the bun which made it even worse. The fries I used to love so much were not hot and not quite cooked long enough.   My friend got the baja tacos and said everything was ok except the tortillas seemed like they were not warmed up and easily broke apart when picking them up to take a bite, and ended up just eating the filling.   I'm not sure if I'd go back for anything but drinks.",

The only thing I miss is the projector / fake fish tank. The $6 jalapeno burger is a good deal, though I really wish they'd bring back that $5 FEZ burger day.

It took about 10 minutes for the waiter to serve us. When he finally asked for our drink order, 2 out of 6 of us ordered a beer. The waiter left and then five minutes later returned (without our drinks) asking what they were again. After we re- requested our drinks, he proceeded to say that he could tell we had a few drinks, so he was only going to serve us one beer. We were laughing and talking! I had a total of two beers that entire evening! We were all stunned, and frankly completely embarrassed. Never have we been treated in such a way. Let me go on to tell you that we are mid 30's parents having a night out. By no means were we acting out of control. This was a terrible situation and completely ruined our evening to the point that we decided to leave the restaurant and go home for fear that our food would be tampered with since we questioned the waiters decision to cut us off for no reason. Terrible terrible service. I will never be visiting this restaurant again.",

The egg on top literally could not have been more over done.  It was more like a hard boiled egg.  The smug little man that brought it to me acted like I was crazy to have wanted my egg to be runny.  Is it me or isn't the reason you get an egg on a burger to have the yolk run out.....!?!  I don't know, maybe I am crazy.  I asked to have it redone and the egg and the burger both came out raw.  I didn't have the energy to send it back again but I should have.  I was able to get half of it down (starving at that point and everyone else was basically finished eating) and paid the consequences later.  I did think the fries and side salad were good though.  Don't usually post bad reviews but for some reason felt the need on this one.  There are a lot of places for good burgers in town and this was definitely bottom of the barrel.  The thing that made me most angry though was the condescending, sarcastic guy/manager/food runner that acted like I was crazy.",

The cherry limeade cocktail I ordered from our server Randi prob took 15 minutes to get to me. It was tasty tho! Between the app and getting my limeade Randi had taken our dinner order. 20 mins later she returned with, \"the computers went down can I get your order again?\" Lol. When the burgers came out-overpriced and mediocre-and on some kind of focaccia/ciabatta bread-No Thank You! And no French fries!! They come with a salad!! Yeah when I crave a burger it usually coincides with wanting to eat healthy-Umm NO!!!! My bad though, I shoulda read the menu. So we ordered the sweet potato fries. They were decent but why cover an already sweet-sweet potato frie with Cinnamon and possibly even sugar??????? Stupid. Horrible value, bad quality, and mediocre service. STAY AWAY!!!! I guess most gays don't really know good food.",

    "text": "I am not going to sugar coat this review, it was an awful experience. I had been going to their former location for many years and loved it, decided to try the new place out on a Sunday afternoon and here is how it went: We were greeted by a young man and told it was a 20 minute wait, although there were many open tables. We took a look around at the new digs, not bad. We sat on a couch and waited about 8 minutes for our table to be ready, when our name was called we were taken to a 2 seat table in the middle of the restaurant by the front door, we asked if we could take a table further back and we were told they were reserved, ok fine, not 5 minutes later a couple and a baby came in and asked to be seated and were seated in the booth we requested with no reservation.  Our server was also not good, not attentive at all, we sat for a long time before he took our order and then again waiting for water and waiting for the check.  The food is ok at best and overpriced, the salad ended up being $17 because we wanted chicken added and it was not worth it at all, just a bowl stuffed with lettuce and not much more.  It is a shame that the service is so poor and the price for salad pretty outrageous, as this is a FORMER favorite and we will not be back.",

    "text": "Went for happy hour and dinner on First Friday with some friends. Understandably  the place was packed,  which  I don't mind because they have plenty of seating.  We asked for a table for 4 which we were told would take 45 min. We didn't really pay much attention and proceeded to the bar and actually got some really comfy lounge seating. The place is loud inside,  so I'm happy that we got patio seating.  People really seem to need to let it all out after a long work week :) the rose water martini is tasty and it was not super sweet. Our waiter in that section was great, and the host guy was helpful getting our tab settled. My friend got word that a 5th person would join us so we asked the guy that sat us if we could take an extra chair. He said no.  But we thought he was joking,  then when we started laughing awkwardly he said that all the chairs are accounted for in the system,  so we couldn't have an extra chair. The lady in the table adjacent to us said we could take her extra chair. Our guest didn't arrive before the lady left so we had to give the chair back when the same guy stared us down like we where misbehaving children. For food we had the fries baked,  delicious,  and we also had the flat breads , gyro and chicken.  Gyro was my favorite,  which is weird because I rarely eat lamb, the pizzas / Flatbreads go by a fancy name I can't remember. I also had their watermelon cocktail which comes with a gummy gum worm. Cute! Monica our server was the highlight of the evening. She's fantastic, and I mean it : pleasant, friendly, got us 2 extra chairs because we actually had 6 people, 7 total join us, all while being smiley, and helpful. Absolutely the best service I've ever had. Way to go  Monica!!!",

And although we didn't partake, it's a spot you'd wanna keep in mind for the future. The service is great! Your greeted happily as soon as you walk through the doors and we were met by our waitress within a few minutes of getting seated. I ordered the Caprese Kisra. Oh my goodness. If you're looking for something pretty light yet filing, this is your dish! This flat bread with the oven dried tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, basil pesto and lemon field salad is my fave. So much that both times I've come I've ordered the same dish. And I rarely do that. My friend ordered the go green pasta. That lemony pesto with pasta on the spinach, pasta and vegetables sprinkled with feta! This was a fork full of flavorful goodness! We'll definitely be returning! Like without a doubt!!! You won't be disappointed with your decision to grab a bite to eat here!",

However after waiting over 5 minutes for a server I asked if they might inform them they we were here and ready. I was told our waitress was on the phone. I said I assumed she must be busy with the big crowd. The waiter replied good one. When Nora did show up it was with full and complete attitude. Obviously our need for service was an inconvenience. We all suffered through the meal and service. Cool thing for me is my money spends anywhere. Sad that such a great setup and pretty decent food can be ruined by such lousy service. Maybe once the restaurant becomes managed we can try again but that will be a far time in the future.",

Only to hear the waiter serving the table behind us shortly give the same dish. I did order it and was very disappointed in the consistency of the mix, less of a dip or cheese expectation. I would eat here again but have to be cautious to be overly specific.",

We ordered the \"spicy harissa\" option but I would probably try something else next time because that option was very oily and not really that spicy. The tomatoes inside were delicious and I loved the simple side salad. It also came with nice crusty toast and jam. I'm glad I shared that plate with my friend because it was a lot of food.  We also got the rosemary fries. I'm not a huge fan of rosemary, but these were really good! It was so many fries, we couldn't even finish but we made a good effort ;)  Would definitely come back for brunch again and maybe try one of their bloody Mary's, which were very reasonably priced.",

The menu offerings are items foodies enjoy most but with FEZ flare. Your not going to come here for a typical hamburger and fries the menu is creative. My favorite is the Fit Fez. A signature plate with choice of meat, sauteed veggies, rice and warm pita bread. My last tasty dish was the Fit Fez with a grilled chicken breast. The healthy option for lunch left me full for the day. Now the fries are my favorite appetizer to share. A variety of flavors including cinnamon dusted sweet potatoes fries.   If you need to wash your food down be sure to order a tasty cocktail. This restaurant is known for their tasty drinks and drink specials.   I have never been unhappy or had a bad experience. The wait staff and cooks always have my food prepared as requested. The plates come out beautiful garnished to the \"T.\" I have never encountered a long wait time. I believe a lot of this has to do with FEZ culture. You can tell all staff is happy to be there. The restaurant is always clean not a dirty table in site both inside or outside which goes well with the trendy decor. The price point is reasonable. This is the perfect spot for a traditional meal, date night or friends night out.",

We called ahead and they got us the perfect space.  The hummus was just delicious, with a nice little kick to it. The salads were not swimming in dressing, and the house dressing was a nice vinaigrette. I had the lamb pita and it was just ideal.  Overall we enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it for groups and people burned out on the local Mexican fare -- which is to do, but after three days a change was needed.",

We asked about drink specials and were told it was happy hour so we all ordered cocktails.  The 5 cocktails took roughly 20 minutes to come to the table and were served one at a time with another excuse that they were down a bartender. The food was actually pretty good but paired with not receiving silverware, awkward service, and confusing excuses, it didn't really make up for the experience.  At the end, we received our checks with all the drinks at full price and were told that they had no way to adjust the pricing.  We eventually got to speak to a manager to discuss the discrepancies and he ended up taking the drinks off the check.  Working with a short staff is hard, but I feel like some steps could've been taken along the way to make our experience more enjoyable, however I don't think we will be back.",

I have to say, I feel like both the food and the atmosphere has only gotten better since they moved farther south to the new location at Central and Portland.  We've been here several times in the past 6 months, ranging from a few girls' nights to a family brunch and have been more than satisfied on each visit.  Plus, the parking is much improved over the previous location.  Menu favorites include the strawberry blueberry cashew salad with chicken, the FEZ fries, the lamb sliders, calamari that stayed crispy even after it had cooled (our fault, due to lengthy conversation), pesto caesar salad, and my favorite brunch item, the FEZ omelette, with a generous serving of gyro meat tucked in the eggs.  They have a tasty house red and very good brunch cocktails.  The only thing that keeps us from being more frequent visitors is the drive into downtown.  Wish they might consider expansion westward, either to the Westgate entertainment district or to the Estrella Falls mall project, if it ever launches.",

The burger was great, the fries left something to be desired. Our server, while very cute, was not attentive once a table filled with people ordering alcohol sat down. In fact, he passed by us six times before asking if he needs anything additional, forgetting that my friend had asked for more ketchup, and we all needed refills on our drinks. By the time he acknowledged us again, we had all finished our food, except for my fries, which were pretty inedible. Once we paid, we were given incorrect change back. They rounded down. At that point, I was just ready to leave. A very disappointing end to what could have been a great experience in a nice setting.",

We were shouting at each other during the entire course of the meal; therefore, I left with a headache. I added chicken to the Pesto Caesar Salad (with toasted pistachio nuts, parmesan cheese and spiky croutons). The salad was drenched in cheese and there was no pesto to be found (not even on the chicken). I cook with pesto and enjoy it. We were in a time crunch, so I didn't make an issue of it. The three others were satisfied with what they ordered. We did not enjoy the noise level and will only return if we can sit outside. So, I was disappointed. How can you enjoy a meal with friends, if you are shouting at each other? Phoenix has many restaurant choices, this is not one of them.",

I would recommend making a reservation as Fez is really popular.  Brian was our server and did a good job of keeping us filled and satisfied.  After looking over the varied Breakfast Brunch options I choose  their Breakfast Pasta on a whim.  The menu description was intriguing - penne pasta tossed with sauteed linguica sausage, pepadew peppers, red onion, bacon & tossed with creamy scrambled egg; topped with parmesan cheese\".  Whoa this is now a favorite (my wife told me I won the brunch wars today after I shared several bites).  The eggs were perfected blended into pasta and the flavors all worked really well together. The sweetness of the peppers were a good contrast to the savory sausage and bacon.  The ample bowl allowed us to linger and watch the eclectic clientele.  Very diverse crowd who all seemed to enjoy their meals.  We are definitely going back.",

    "text": "What can I say? Hmmm.... FEZ is a happy place, they have a hipster vibe, it almost seems like the happening place to be in this part of town. My visit to the establishment was run of the mill: I stayed close by, it was a short walk.   The customer service was slow and it was due in large to the sheer volume of people at this place ( it was close to Fire Marshall shut down full). When I recognize this situation I typically order drinks and the meal together to help all out.     I ordered the FEZ burger, spicy fries and a margarita. The burger was said to be and I quote \"wildly popular\" my taste buds relayed to my brain and mouth average at best. The spicy fries were good but they really are ensuring my waistline does not grow as the portion size was small.  The margarita was needle point sharp good! Wow that damn thing was amazing!   I sat outside because the weather was perfect: I like to people watch and it was noisy inside plus I had my latest book with me. With the large volume of people the slow service and small portion sizes I have to rate this place three stars.  I have nothing against the LGBT community as my motto for the most part is live and let live: except when I see crimes against women and children and other violence. FEZ  is supported well by the gay community, there were tons of couples on dates and quite a few of the waiters and waitresses appeared to be apart of the community, so if you're not at a place of accepting others different than you I would not partake of this place. I mean no harm or ill will.   Take it easy breezy!",

Servers are well versed on the menu and always offer up suggestions. I always shoot for the rosemary chicken sandwich with no feta and it never fails me! Sandwiches come with a side salad or the choice to upgrade to frys. This establishment is always clean and extremely welcoming to new customers. Their breakfast menu has just about everything you could ask for from Omelets to hash and eggs, they have drink specials absolutely every day of week & food you won't want to miss out on. Fez is a downtown staple and makes every customer feel like a new friend! They are also offering these new infusions, I had one today that consists of bourbon, walnuts and some other ingredients and it was great!! The bartender told us exactly how it should be served and accommodated my special request to have it served over ice with a slice of lemon and I couldn't have been happier. I'll be back soon!!",

Since it was mothers day, my mom and I decided to check this out before the museum and we LOVED it. We did the Fez burger which Brian suggested and although the feta cheese, pears and molasses sauce sounded weird, he assured us it was delicious and it was. We also tried the Barcelona bibb salad...yum. Candied cashews and feta with onions. So good. My niece had a pita gyro and she also loved it. We tried the chips and salsa with guacamole for an app as well. Top a this off with a couple peach bellinis and we really had a fantastic meal, great service and such a nice time.

The food is great, the staff is amazing and surprisingly stable for a restaurant.

So after driving around completely confused for about 5 minutes I found it and the new FEZ is beautiful! I mean the inside is just gorgeous... Now that I have gotten that out of the way let's move to my next favorite the food is amazing, I've tried a couple of different dishes and appetizers and EVERYTIME it was a hit.   The service is good too attentive but not annoying, informative but not pushy, friendly but not the Gawd what kind of drugs are they on kind of friendly either... So to me the service is the perfect balance.   And my fav is the drinks !!  I went on Tini Tuesday and the certain Martinis where $4 and they were yummy and strong, so much so that after two I had to crash at a nearby friends house!   We did get dessert the last time and I wasn't wow'd, but then again I'm supposed to be on a diet so I wasn't supposed to get desert lol!  The verdict: great food, great service, amazing drinks and good prices! Go there like now !!!",

Best part of the meal was the roasted vegetables, which the whole party I was with agreed it was just superb. Grilled and seasoned to perfection. The lamb sliders for my Fez Fit was surprisingly small portioned given it was an extra $4. I'd say stick with the chicken or gyro strip option. The whole plate was decently filling though given my huge appetite. Dessert was just amazing. Try the carrot cake drizzled with caramel for sure.",

This time we arrived for dinner around 5:20pm on a Saturday, there were plenty of empty tables outside and inside, although there were some that were reserved for parties who had yet to arrive. We were seated at a hi top by the bar immediately.   The host was super friendly, and eventually the bartender came over to give us water and take our drink orders. Our apparent waiter appeared a bit after and asked if we wanted anything else? No introduction so it was a bit awkward, but he took our food order for us and later dropped off the check after awhile. Another waitress picked up the check though, so I'm not sure if our guy was overloaded with tables or what. But I've never had an issue with service before so I won't count it against them.   Onto the food! I ordered the grilled chicken pita and my girlfriend got the All American burger with an added side of fries.   The grilled chicken pita was amazing... apple, onion, dried pear, dates, goat cheese and pomegranate vinaigrette. The flavor combination was perfect and the portion size was just right. I stuck with the small salad that comes with the meal which had a tasty dressing.   The burger was good, it's on ciabatta bread instead of a traditional bun, so it looks more like a burger sandwich, but was good!! The salt and pepper fries were classic and tasty.   The ambiance is funky and modern and I liked that the chairs for the hi top tables had small backs to them, makes them so much more comfortable than the usual stools places will have. Definitely a cool place to hang out!",

My friend ordered the strawberry one and I got a taste and whoah it was overwhelmingly sweet! Plus the drink came in a basic cup(presentation was lame) so I decided to skip on it. As for food I ordered the Romana adobo which was delicious! Even the garlic bread was something to rave about! However, when I got the check I was a bit surprised. It was practically $6 to add chicken which I had, but didn't realize it would be that pricey. $25 for a plate of pasta is bit TOO much in my opinion. It was very tasty but honestly not worth that price. The overall ambience of FEZ is great and totally worth coming back too!",

So you're basically paying to sit and eat in a  cute restaurant but food that you could get the same thing somewhere else for a lot less. And we were not impressed with the cinnamon and sugar sprinkles on our french fries... blech.",

I was warned that it would be hot, but I could have used a little more heat. But then again, I breathe fire, so don't go by me. If love to try this place again during the week for the rest of their menu. So I'll be back.",

    "text": "This is mainly a review of their catering service.  This week I had a holiday potluck and needed something quick. The place I work gets their large catering platters for events sometimes and they are decent.   So, I called at noon on the day I needed it and asked if there was any way they could make me the $30 hummus party platter (hummus, veggies and bread) for pick up at 5:30pm that day.  The guy confirmed with someone and came back on the phone and said yes. He took my name and number and confirmed what I wanted and the 5:30 pick up time (twice).   I arrived at 5:35. I told the guy that first approached that I was there to pick up a hummus platter to-go.  He disappears into the kitchen area, comes out, indicates they are packaging it up and then roams around taking care of his tables.   So I wait. And wait. About 10 minutes later another guy approaches me and tells me that they didn't have any record of my order but could put it together for me.   Seriously? I told him no thanks and left! I had to be at the potluck at 6 and didn't have time to wait.  I had a similar experience with catering here before. I came to pick up a large order of catering platters for a colleague for an event we had and arrived at the set pick up time. Although they did have the order, it took them 20 minutes to get it packaged and to my car.   I'm sorry - but if I specify a specific pick up time (in order for food to stay hot as long as possible and with travel time to get back to event and set it up, etc) I expect it to be packaged and ready to go at that time.  Call me crazy.   I will not be using them again. There are other competent places in the area - Pita Jungle, Postino's, etc.",

We figured our waitress (Marissa?) was flirting and trying to impress the dude sitting there. Then some random guy who I'm not sure was a host or a bartender came to over to our table way too close to what I assume was to possibly pick up some of the empty plates, which we didn't have. The only issue with that was that he said nothing. He literally walked over, looked over the table then walked away. It was weird.   Service aside, the food was so good. I was on a lunch break and couldn't get a drink but my friends said that the Martinis were delicious. We all loved what we got. I thought I was ordering garlic Rosemary fries but they seemed to only be salt/pepper/Rosemary. They were still so good. I also got the all american burger. It wasn't really medium like I ordered but the patty was juicy and made up for that.   I'm definitely going to try it again to see if maybe I went on a weird off day.",

Way better than the Italian speciality restaurant we tried last week. :)  My girl ordered the bacon mushroom bistro steak (medium) with the mushroom sauce on the side.  It turns out the steak was very tasty without the mushroom sauce.  We shared everything.  As for drinks I ordered the strawberry margarita.  The drink had decent strength but had no flavor to it.  It tasted like liquor mixed with sugared water.  I can overlook that.   We both enjoyed our dinners very much and had a great time.  Can't wait to try it again.",

My only issue was that my friend and I both ordered absolut martinis and we discussed later that we were fairly certain the vodka they gave us wasn't absolut. It was very harsh. Could have been an honest mistake and we didn't really think about it until later so we couldn't address it.   Other than that I enjoyed everything and so did the two others I was with. My friend had a side of spicy fries with his burger. I tasted them and WOW. Best fries I've ever had. They were not greasy and had the perfect kick to them. I ordered a pesto Caesar salad which was very fresh and there was not even one piece of wilted lettuce (I'm a snob about fresh lettuce in a salad which is why I tend to avoid them but I took a chance here and it paid off).  We enjoyed it so much we came back later to have another drink at the bar. I think the bartenders name was Lindsey and she was fabulous. Very friendly and made a delicious lemon martini. I will come back next time I'm in Phoenix for sure!",

    "text": "Alright, lets get something out of the way.  Prior to visiting FEZ's new location, I read the early reviews.  Most of the early negative reviews centered around a poorly handled Facebook conflict with a customer.  I didn't see the Facebook snafu for myself, but I agree disabling Facebook comments is lame way to dodge the issue.  Still, my hope is that FEZ's social media guru (and their staff in general) learned from the incident.  For the sake of this Yelp review, I'm not taking that incident into account because I don't believe its fair for me to judge a business on something I didn't witness myself.  Now then, let's get down to business.  I've been to FEZ's old location a number of times and I was a fan of their food and of their staff.  When I heard that they were going to be taking over the vacated restaurant space on Central and Portland (formerly occupied by Portland's Wine Bar), I was ecstatic.  The location could not be more tailor made for a restaurant like FEZ.  Its an urban location that meshes perfectly with FEZ's urban vibe.  Plus its just a few miles south of the old location, making it accessible to their loyal customers and newly accessible to the Downtown work and happy hour crowd.  The only question for me was whether FEZ would retain the same charm and quality.  If my first visit is any indication, my answer is emphatically yes.  The remodel of this restaurant space has done wonders to liven up this corner of Central and Portland.  Both the interior and exterior space of the restaurant make  ample use of the space to pack in the patrons, while at the same time not making it feel overcrowded.  I came here with a friend on a Friday night around 5pm.  We were greeted and sat immediately (decided to sit inside tonight as it was a little chilly outside).  The menu is exactly as I remember it, with a wide kaleidoscope of items to choose from but most famously including their burgers and fries.  To ensure that the food was just as good I remembered, I went with an old standby.  A FEZ Burger and some of their famous cinnamon sweet potato fries.  Got a glass of red wine to go with it.  My friend got a half salad as she wasn't very hungry.  The food is just as good as I remember from their old location.  A medium burger topped with honey bbq sauce, pears (yes pears), feta, onions, and a garlic aioli.  A heavenly burger to be sure.  Their sweet potato fries are dusted with cinnamon and come with a deliciously savory sauce mixture on the side.  Again, great combination of flavors that almost made the fries taste like a dessert.  So now to the negative part of my review about FEZ that pretty much carries over from its old location.  The prices.  Total tab for a FEZ burger, fries, a glass of wine, tax and tip came to about $28.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't your normal burger and fries, but still not cheap.  The only other compliant I would register is that the interior acoustics are such that it can get really loud inside when its full.  Still, taken as a whole, FEZ is an excellent addition to the neighborhood and a terrific spot for happy hour after work.  Their old location garnered an average of about 4 stars on Yelp.  I think that's just right for their new location as well.  A bit pricey, but their food and their staff have always been top notch when I've been there.  And I love what they've done with the new space.  Whatever mistakes were made when they opened will hopefully guide them to continue improving towards a long successful tenure on Portland Street.",

I had the FEZ lettuce wraps appetizer which were chicken with dried pears, dates, dried cherries & almonds with romaine lettuce shells. So good!  Then for the meal I had the FEZ Lemon & Pomegranate grilled plate with blackened salmon...wow! It had grilled veggies and pistachio rice.  Every bite of this meal was heaven.

Tim came over and tried to make light of the situation by making jokes, however, it made me feel uncomfortable as it was a laugh to be had at my expense. We felt as though he was mocking the fact that a piece of metal was in my meal, but this could have turned out to be a lot more serious had I actually bit into it. There was no answer on where it came from and how it found its place on my plate.

First thing first, there are booths and tables. Wide bodies like me will do well with the tables and very sturdy chairs. Even the patio chairs feel reliable and \"safe\" for bigger butts (like mine).   I started with a nonalcoholic drink called Morroccan something and it was superb.  Followed this up with a bowl of FEZ Feta Fries and rolled my eyes after each forkful. These are sooo good! My friend ordered the fries with bacon bits and a Thousand Island-like topping but it didn't taste good to me. Too salty IMO.   No one ordered entrees, just appetizers and drinks and a good time was had by all!  PS- shout out to Allison our server for being awesome!",

    "text": "Stopped by here for brunch this morning with hubby. I have eaten here several times in the past at lunchtime but never for brunch and I'm wondering what took me so long! We were seated right away as we got there right when they opened. They have a nice selection of brunch drinks - both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. Hubby and I both opted for a Bloody Mary. I got the Cucumber Mary and he opted for the Kirk's Green Mary. Although we both thought each other's were good, we both preferred the ones we had ordered. Although I have to admit I did like the hint of sweetness right after the bit of spice in his! I ordered the Breakfast Pasta and I was in total heaven. The eggs were creamed throughout and there was the perfect amount of bacon and sausage that every bite was a little different. And the peppers they added were the icing on the cake. Will definitely go back and order that again! Hubby opted for the Greek Eggs Benedict. His was really good as well however he would have preferred the eggs poached rather than scrambled like it came out. We really enjoyed our meal and I will have to bring hubby back for lunch or dinner one day soon!",

I literally dream about this breakfast.  The sausage is  zesty, fresh and also large serving (no need to get more than one).  Add that with a Mimosa bucket for $15 and you have the makings of perfection.  The patio is nice and big, with plenty of outdoor seating.  The staff are always quite friendly, attentive and provide great service.  A wonderful place to enjoy a Sunday morning.  Cheers",

But on weekends - it's reliable, consistent good service, fresh and tasty food that has never disappointed.  It's an imaginative menu that puts a fun twist on most standard faire.  The location is awesome as it's near several good walking areas (if weather permits!).  Note parking is available in the ramp next door, rather than fight with the few spots on a heavy traffic street.",

We did the guacamole and chips for appetizer but ate too quickly to snap a photo lol. Only issue was they charged me for extra salsa lol! Tell people if you're charging them :p The salad I had was delicious and my husband had the protein plate which he really enjoyed. The portions are huge so he had enough from both of us for his dinner. The spot is nice with a large outdoor patio and ample bar seating. They appear to take reservations for the booths so if you want a booth call ahead and reserve it :) We enjoyed the ambiance and will for sure be back. Parking situation is a parking garage where it's free for two hours. Good staff and everyone was pleasant to us while we were there. Cool spot to hang out after work for sure. They have daily drink specials as well.",

Happy hour here after work was pretty fun. I had the FEZ nachos w/ chicken and the chick strips ala FEZ (aka chicken fingers/strips). The nachos were a HUGE serving size and super yummy. The chicken strips were pretty good and came with a unique dipping sauce (I forgot what it's called). Another time, our group had the grilled chicken pita and the chicken phyllo packets. The pita was alright. But man... the phyllo packets were delicious. It's crispy (but light) on the outside, juicy and soft on the inside. It came with another mysterious dipping sauce that complemented them very well.  Decor is modern and there are seats indoors and out in the patio. Parking is easy - there's a garage shared with the church, nearby businesses & apartment residents. Customer service has been on point each time. Can't wait to come back!",

Which means it's just frozen store bought. Waitress forgot to put in my order so I had to wait 35 minutes for my food while everyone else at the table was already done eating. I had to wait that long because I sat there for 10 minutes and then had to track her down to ask about my food. She never even came back to check or ask where my food was. When my food came out, My egg white omelette was absolutely DRENCHED in oil. I even showed the waitress. And the toasts that came with it were hard as a rock like they were sitting out all night.   This used to be one of my favorite spots. Now that the quality has slowed down with the food and the service, I will not be returning. There's too many other good restaurants around to go to. RIP Fez : (",

Went with a girlfriend and split a burger, they charged us the $2 for an extra plate.  Had a cup of soup too salty on the tomato lentil . Ordered a large basket of fries part salt and pepper and part garlic and rosemary, they were good, at first couldn't taste the garlic, but it showed up later after leaving the restaurant. There is a parking garage right next to the place so thats not an issue. Service was pleasant, place was clean and the restrooms have two stalls. Pricey though two people splitting a burger, large fries and 2 cups of soup and water over $31 It was an experience that I won't have again.",

One bite and back it went. It tasted awful and not even close to the real thing. It was the texture of stirred canned dog food and brown. I've never seen brown eggplants!  So I ordered lamb sliders. The lamb was ground, dry and lacked any lamb flavor. Lots of salt though. My wife decided on nachos, thinking that had to be safe. She asked for the beef topping. The chips were just weird. No corn flavor at all. The cheese was whipped Velveta. The beef was ground and tasted two days old. Taco Bell nachos are much better. We did not finish either.   My regret is I was not there two hours later to return the meal.   Never again!!!!!  PS The service was very good with a very polite waiter.  Not his fault.",

We have had a great experience both times that we were there, that will lead us to more returns in the future. Our 1st visit we had NORA as our server, she was warm/welcoming and knowledgeable....she validated our selections and made suggestions that resulted in an up-sell to our order. We came back a week later based off of the positive experience with NORA (we specifically asked for her as our server, but she had the day off)...CALEB was our second experience dining at FEZ...Equally as welcoming and knowledgeable. We appreciated his suggestions to our order and his friendly nature. CALEB went beyond just \"waiting\" on our table-He took the time to engage with us as people and not just \"paying customers\". I'm going on and on about the service, but haven't mentioned the food.....Margarita's in many flavors (I had Apricot), Lamb sliders (had those both times I was there), Baja Tacos...all good....I usually stick with what I know/like, but looking forward to trying other things on the menu!!

That isn't to knock on it, but just calling it how I see it.   The staff is great and the restaurant as a whole seems very gay friendly (coming from a gay man). We dined on a Wednesday night I believe it was and the night before was very \"lively\" from what my co-worker said (assuming more straight and busy). The night we went there was definitely more of a gay crowd, and I liked it! The area it is in is a little further from downtown and looks a little less lite and rough in a sense.   Apps:  (1) lamb sliders - these were AMAZING! It wasn't my idea to order these, but they were definitely a must get! (2) nazare' calamari - Calamari was average as most calamari - it was good. The aioli was definitely done right!    Entree: (1) go green pasta - this was recommended by the waiter and definitely DELICIOUS! The portions are huge, so of course I couldn't finish it, but I couldn't stop eating it either! I had it with chicken and the spring vegetables were plenty! From asparagus to Zucchini all of it was delicious, and I didn't even realize I liked Zucchini!   Drink:  (1) I had a few beers on tap! Nothing special!! I am sure everything is great though!",

I walked in, waited a few minutes for someone to give us a table, then someone finally came and sat us down. He have me quite a smart alec response to a question. That's cool.   Our server took our order. She forgot to bring me my drink. She didn't bring my sister a plate. My sister ate off a napkin. How classy.   The food- meh. My rosemary chicken sandwich needed salt and the chicken was dry. The fries were TOOOOOO salty. Oh, and my sister found a live bug crawling on her pomegranate Margarita. I have a really bad tummy ache from the food last night, too. Oh yay!  We went on a Thursday at 10pm and should of got great service since we were basically the only ones there. I can only imagine what FEZ is like on a busy day. Oh well!",

Don't get to close to the borders bc you get some homeless asking for dollars, not cool if you are trying to enjoy ur meal... The service is good!

I'm visually impaired and   wandered in accidentally while on the way to a coffee shop nearby, and an employee  was kind enough to escort me to this other  business. When I wandered in, I was told the name of the business, and when I ask for assistance, it was given without hesitation. This could've been on a busy night, and The employee may have had a lot on her plate, but took the time to help me out. This speaks very highly not only to the kind of person this employee is, but likely speaks to the caliber of her colleagues at Fez. one of their employees may have led me over to a competitive business, I will likely be stopping by in the near future. Ymay be impatient with a long wait on a busy night, or small errors in the delivery of service, I just wanted to express my appreciation for this act of kindness, and by extension for  Fez  and it's quality of customer service.",

We were able to parallel park right in front of the restaurant doors, but if you aren't so fortunate, there is a parking garage available! The hostess greeted us when we walked in and was incredibly friendly! we waited about 15 minutes or so for a table, and when we were seated, our waiter met us immediately and was incredibly accommodating. I ordered the FEZ Benedict with a substitution of gluten free toast. it. was. amazing. My mom got the \"Best egg white omelet you'll ever have\" and agreed that it lived up to the name. the prices were very reasonable, the atmosphere was great, and the service and food were incredible. great brunch stop!!",

This past Sunday however, was absolutely the worst experience ever. I was greeted from a gentlemen asking the usual question how many people are with me (which i was alone at the time because i was having a friend meet me there) i then answered 2. I then asked if i could please sit outside, he answers sure. He goes out to the patio and comes back in with a terrible attitude stating \"so its about to rain out there and if you decide to sit out there we are most likely not gonna have any seating inside\". I look around and they have probably at the most 15 guest in the restaurant and about 6 outside... He then seats me outside with tension and i ask is there any specials today, he states \"nope\". He brings me back a glass of water and after almost 15 minutes of waiting there with no service i decide to get up to let him know that im going to leave after all but thank you. He then with an attitude and practically rolling his eyes says \"okay great\". I start walking out but then felt that i should let the manager know so that nobody else has to experience this kind of behavior or attitude. I ask him for the manager and he says \"My name is joey, i am the manager\". My jaw drops and i say \"wow, well i just want to let you know that i feel you were absolutely rude and that i received terrible/No service\". He gets upset and says with his finger, \"how was i rude, how was i rude\"! I then explained to joey that i am a concierge here in downtown phoenix and i will not be sending anyone there way because i would hate for anyone especially our guest to experience this sort of service. On a brighter note i walked over to Match Cuisine right in front and got the Best genuine service and i was taken care of very well. By the way it never rained outside..",

Everyone that works there is helpful, friendly, and happy, but two people I'd like to give shout outs to are Luke and Fabian. Fabian was our server most recently and we never had to ask for a thing. He brought extra water, ice, and anticipated everything we might want. On top of great service the food is delicious! I got the black bean burger, my friend got the Rosemary chicken sandwich, and both were yummy. I can't remember what her husband ate, but he was drinking the \"G\" Spot (on special) and in heaven. Awesome place right in the heart of downtown.",

While I was waiting for the rest of my group to get there I saw some great looking plates pass by. The hummus and apps looked amazing. We didn't try one this time but will be back for sure to test them out.   At this visit I had their pear and goat cheese salad with chicken. It was very tasty a little bit to much dressing for my taste I will make sure to get it on the side next time. But the pears were very flavorful and the dried cherries are just the right amount of sweet with the tang of goat cheese the dressing really ties it all together. I would go back for this again.   The other people I was with had the fez platter which looked amazing, chicken ad rice along with a bunch of goodies. And Cesar salad,  it comes with pistachio in it what a great idea. A little crunch and salt in the salad.   I will be returning here for sure it was great, the only problem I see is that their patio has a lot of sun light and in the summer it will get very how without shade and some misters.",

I often end up ordering salads or steaks when eating out since they're more likely to be safe. Fez does actually have gluten free bread for burgers and sandwiches, but it's not super. It was quite hard, and I ended up finishing my burger with a fork and knife rather than mess with the bread. Still, food was good, service was good. Their drinks are very creative and tasty.",

I had two mimosas, and felt pretty grand about my life. We ate on the patio because we had our dogs with us.  We ordered them some eggs and the waiter, very enthusiastic about dogs, said he'd add a side of chicken in there.  What we didn't consider, but perhaps should have because we understood FEZ's portions, is that the plates of egg and chicken that he brought out for our dogs was enough to feed an adult human, and our dogs weigh 12 and 22 pounds.  (And yes, he brought out TWO plates of food for them.)  We let the dogs indulge, but they couldn't handle their own gluttony, and were sick the rest of the weekend.  Really we know that this is our fault for not taking the portions away sooner, or specifying size better to the waiter.  But as someone who said he was a small dog owner himself, I still can't quite understand what he was thinking.  Surely he doesn't feed his own dogs that much!! So, FEZ is solidly four stars.  The lack of sleep that resulted in endless trips outside that night makes me hindsight it to 3.",

We enjoyed the sour lemon and French martinis, very nicely done and generous pours, followed by a chicken pita sandwich and the duxelles burger. Both superior, starting with the quality of the ciabatta bun on the burger and the killer pita bread. Great burgers are a treat, and Fez gets them right. I failed to ask where they get their ground beef, but suspect it is an artisanal butcher nearby. Regardless, this burger smells and tastes like prime steak ground in the kitchen to order, and that was just the beginning. The menu has many more things to try, demanding a return trip. The value make Fez a no-brainer for your list of regular spots.",

I first ordered the pita and humus as a entree. The humus was great, the pita was also great and still hot when it came out of the kitchen. I then ordered the hamburger with fries.  It did take a little longer than I expected to come out of the kitchen. I was not amazed but it still was pretty tasty. My sister ordered the nachos with chicken witch I tasted. The cheese was still hot and melted and the chicken cooked perfectly. Over all the food was good. The server then found out it was my sisters birthday and brought out a dessert. Which I thought was very kind of the staff and also they did not charge us for the dessert. The dessert was a nut brownie with ice cream I thought it was very delicious. I would totally recommend FEZ. Its kid friendly and has delicious food.",

The sweet potato fries are the bomb, and the margarita I had was pretty good. Location is great too. Prices are also pretty good.  Cons: it's one of those places that makes you think the art of customer service is officially dead. When my friend and I arrived, there were several open tables. The host acted like it was a HUGE burden to seat us (despite it being, ya know, his job). He wanted to seat us at a bar table even though several booths were open. He said no outside seating was available when there was definitely an open table that we walked past on our way in. We asked for a booth because the bar tables were too tall for me to sit comfortably in the dress I was wearing. This whole interaction put a sour taste in my mouth from the get go. Not a good first impression. My main dish, the Go Green Pasta, was mediocre. Too much sauce and made me feel a little sick later.   I probably won't go back.",

Well they were on point about service.  It was probably close to the slowest service I've experienced in awhile. It wasn't even crowded which was kinda odd. You would have thought the service would have been better.  We ordered a cheese board. It was to include nuts and prosciutto. The nuts ended up being shaved almonds ( as my friend said something you would put on a salad) and rolled ham. I know what the difference is. We sent it back and the waiter said we're about to take it off the menu anyway. Could he have told us before we ordered it? So we made it simple for them and ordered chips, salsa and guacamole which again took forever to get to us. At this point we're all starving. I ordered a simple cheese burger. It honestly had no real flavor. They say brunch is a better time to come not that the service is any better but the food is better.

    "text": "FEZ has been my go-to in downtown Phoenix ever since they offered delectable margaritas (in so many flavors! With creative, fun garnish!) at prices unheard of since Paz closed down.   Happy hour has since changed into daily specials and discounted appetizers. My favorite is the feta fries, especially if you ask for the mint yogurt sauce for dipping. And as for the margaritas, every flavor is spot on.   The menu is Mediterranean inspired with some fresh twists on other regional foods, such as the coconut curry--add blackened chicken if you eat meat. Veggies make a strong appearance in many of the dishes, so there is reason to justify it is health food.   If you have a dog in tow, this is the perfect place to take a seat on the patio with your pup. The nearby Hance Park ensures several sightings of fellow furry friends so your dog will be just as entertained as you are.   Free parking is available to customers of FEZ, Fair Trade, and surrounding businesses in the adjacent garage. The atmosphere is fairly vibrant and trendy, making it more date friendly than for families.",

We have meetings there or meet friends, and it's always a great experience. Last night, I had the soft tacos, beef version, and they were the best tacos I have ever eaten.  Alongside the delectable Apricosmo, my favorite cocktail in the Universe-- well, just when you think Fez can't delight your tastebuds any more, they bring out an even more delicious menu item.  Have friends meet you, and park in the nearby parking building, free.",

    "text": "This is a review for my gluten free experience.   I always look at a restaurant's menu beforehand, so I know my options. FEZ offers a gluten free bun for all of their burgers, but the menu does not specify which burger toppings/sauces are gluten free. I asked my waiter if he could check the specific ingredients for the FEZ burger. I don't know if there was a miscommunication... but he started explaining how there was no way to know for sure. I didn't understand that answer. I mean... either the toppings and sauces are made by someone in the kitchen or it comes in a package with ingredients listed. The conversation ended with him agreeing to check the packaging.   Turns out, the FEZ burger is gluten free (with the exception of the fried onions). Their bun was SUPER dry and just not good. I know that's usually the story with gluten free buns, but I've definitely had better at places like OHSO.   My burger had a side salad with a vinaigrette dressing. I also ordered a mango rosemary martini. My husband ordered a beer and a strawberry chicken salad. Our bill was about 50 bucks. Overall, pricey. Decent food but if you have special requests like gluten free, don't expect too much effort.",

It was just late, needed some good food after a concert and this was one of the few nearby places that actually looked pretty good. I have heard amazing things about the veggie burger for years and I have to go back and try it. But yesterday I decided to just try out a couple of appetizers instead. We had such a hard time deciding because there were so many amazing vegetarian options. Also there's vegan options there too! We ended up getting the garlic hummus and nachos (with chicken on the side). The hummus was incredible. The veggies served with it were fresh and the bread was delicious and crunchy but I wish the bread was heated up a bit. The nachos were yummy too, I can be picky about nacho cheese but this was good stuff. Not like the best nachos ever, but tasty. The guac was yummy too, and my boyfriend said he liked the side of chicken. Prices weren't terrible for the huge portions we got. We had leftovers! That's rare for me.",

It was really relaxed and the food was good too. This visit, much like my previous visit, was pleasant.  For our meals, I got the Fez burger (with chicken instead of beef) & a side of fries and my friend got the Fez salad. The sandwich was a bit hard to eat because they're very generous with the sauce, and that paired with the pear & feta cheese is a bit sloppy but absolutely delicious. My friend said her salad was good too!  I'd definitely recommend trying the g-spot to drink. I'm not much of a grapefruit fan but per recommendation of our waitress I got it. It was super refreshing & delicious, especially for the summer time.  I will say that the service was absolutely terribly slow even though it wasn't busy at all! It took a while for our server to come by and get our drink/food order & then it really took way too long to get our checks. Since we had the afternoon to kill, we were ok spending a little bit more time there than anticipated, however.  I liked that there was a large parking structure right by the restaurant so having to look for parking wasn't an issue. I'd definitely recommend this place if you have time to spare. We'll be back in the future.",

I decided for a mimosa and the Spice Road (Asian) chicken sandwich.   Before I knew it, maybe 10ish minutes later, it had been delivered. Hot! After my first bite the bartender did the quality/satisfaction check. I loved it! Btw, the portion is quite generous. You will not walk out hungry.    My mimosa glass had one more sip left. The barback asked if I would like another. I did!  I took my time eating. Never did I feel rushed. Shortly after my last bite bartender asks if I needed anything else.

Although there are a ton of yummy sounding options on the menu, I always get the same thing because it is SO DELISH!  - Fez salad ($11.95) adding gyro meat ($4.95) on top. This is the kind of salad I dream of- a huge bowl of fresh greens, toasted almonds, goat cheese, dried cherries, and sliced pears. Although the menu says the pears are cinnamon spiced, I didn't notice it this time. The gyro meat is tender enough to cut with a fork and really tasty, not at all greasy or fatty. I prefer dressing on the side so I can control how much I add, and the one that comes with this salad is sweet and tangy.  - French fries- half cinnamon dusted sweet potato (these come with a yummy dipping sauce) and half garlic and rosemary. This basket is large enough for four people to share and only $4.25 during happy hour. - Happy hour specials on drinks are good, too, with a decent house wine for only $4.   Love this place and need to come here more often.",

Even though the restaurant was not full it took half an hour after our party arrived for us to order brunch, twenty minutes to get our food, and another half hour to get the check.  We ordered the FEZ jumbo hotcake with strawberry/blueberry, berbere prime beef hash & eggs, and golden curry egg scramble. The hotcake as advertised was one large pancake, but tasted more like a dense dry cake than an pancake; I only enjoyed the crispy crust. The prime beef hash was liked at everyone else at the table, but I did not like the excessive sauce and lack of potatoes. The golden curry was not outstanding either but the best of the three. I would return for the mimosa set for $15 but not the food.",

The staff is always attentive and there to top off your drinks.  New location has a good size parking garage close to the restaurant if street parking is not available. One other option is the light rail has a stop very close to the front door.",

Unfortunately the margarita is not fresh lime and served in a pint glass which is just so much gross fake neon mix.  For food I tried the lemon & Pomegranite grill plate with vegetables only.  This was served with \"grilled\" squash and onions with rice, pistachios and fresh Pomegranite seeds. Thank goodness for the slice of lemon & yummy Pom because otherwise this dish was a bore.   The tiramisu looked yummy but the other ladies were not a fan of it and so we did not try it. How can you not like tiramisu?  All I know is I did not want the whole thing to myself!  Our server was very timely, courteous and helpful.  He served all our food correctly and made a special inquiry to the kitchen as to if the goat cheese is pasteurized.  Maybe I tried the wrong dish and drink?  I say don't serve it if it's not fresh!  Next time I'm drinking wine and getting tiramisu for dessert!",

The chicken cutlets were cooked to death and the salad was drowning in dressing. My partner had the battered cod which was one small piece of cod served with un memorable carbs.  Never should the food server be responsible for dealing with a bad experience.  I would have expected someone from the management team to come to the table and that did not happen.  I will go back as I have been a Fez patron for ten years.  I just expect more. As always the service is always delivered with a smile and enthusiasm.  Don't make these people do the dirty work you as management should do.  l",

The open feeling and overall urban/loft vibe put me in a great mood and made me feel young again. The flowing feeling and overall walk through of the location made me very comfortable, despite being uneasy in a city I did not know or recognize.   The drink menu was beyond words. The type of drinks and choice mixes were some very interesting and curious blends. We had a delicious taste of a few, as we were a group of 4, so we each tried a sip of one another's. Each drink was unique in its own taste and was very delicious considering the way it was mixed and what the ingredients were.   The appetizers were very satisfying. We went to have some appetizers on our way out to the club, but it was very delicious and satisfying. A good option and choice meal to satisfy the palette.   I would recommend FEZ to anyone going to visit or anyone who hasn't tried it. Its a great experience.",

    "text": "I was ready to write a scathing review, as I also was annoyed when they moved even farther from my neighborhood and my beloved turkey burger has been removed from the menu (a while ago I believe).  My friend and j waited for quite a while for a table, though they weren't that busy, especially in the bar.  Thankfully we could relax on the couch in the bar area and chat, so it wasn't bat big a deal.  I also don't get what's up with the \"reserved\" signed tables, and now understand why some restaurants don't take reservations.  However, beyond having to ask twice for a to-go box, the service once seated was excellent.  The food was also superb.  I had the $6 Wednesday special of chicken strips and salt & pepper fries, and it was amazing.  The serving size was generous, the food was served piping hot, and the presentation was even very nice for a glorified chicken basket!  Their thin strips of chicken breast were breaded with a subtly spicy, cinnamon-infused crunch.  The fries also tasted a bit more cinnamony than usual but they were probably fried with the chicken or just absorbed some of the chicken's aroma or something!  A shared slice of cheesecake was also really good, creamy and not too light or too heavy, with a light Nutella-like layer and a fresh slices strawberry to compliment it.  I grudgingly admit I'll be back, despite my annoyance with downtown in general.  I even found very convenient parking in the garage, so all I can complain about is the construction around the area and being stuck behind a bus.  Oh, I know a complaint I could make!  The seating was pretty awful.  I don't get why they would do half-booths where half of the party is stuck in a relatively uncomfortable chair!  Not a fan, and I miss the old familiar decor too...though my dining companion loved all of the colorful plastic/glass decorations like the giant thing above the bar.",

The bar area is by far my favorite change in that it's no longer segregated and even has additional seating around the parameter of the bar aside from right at the bar itself. The food is still the same great quality (if not a touch better) and the drinks are just as well made. The patio area is definitely better and larger and the garage parking is a nice perk as well (especially with the Blink charging stations for those driving eco-friendly cars.)

The sandwiches are a solid choice, good daily drink specials. I've had a couple entrees there and wasn't blown away. Last night, I ordered the arroz con pollo. It was super spicy, but not very flavorful. The rice was kind of gummy, in a thick, starchy red sauce more reminiscent of Chinese food than Spanish cuisine. After my food was brought out, a long period of time elapsed before anyone asked if everything was satisfactory, or would I like another drink, etc. And that's been consistent with past experiences there. Young and cute doesn't always equal competent and courteous, unfortunately. Not sure the point of a host/hostess stand when no one greets you upon arriving or leaving the establishment. I want to support the gay community here in Phoenix, and downtown businesses. But I'm more likely, at this point, to dine somewhere with consistently excellent food and service. There's too much competition for mediocre places to survive.",

    "text": "That's a generous two stars. My girlfriend and I sat outside on a beautiful Friday night, and that's where the trouble began. We waited an unusually long time to be served by Marissa, and then waited an unusually long time for our drinks and our fries. The fries were decent enough, they were the fries on the appetizer menu, and were topped with bacon, onion, feta cheese, ranch, and tomatoes. Sounds good, but I've had better at many dive bars around town, and have put together much better myself when I had the munchies. I don't even remember the cocktail I had, but my girlfriend got the daily special and she said it was weak and watery. I had the lamb sliders with mint yogurt sauce, cucumber, and tomato. Sounds good, but again very pedestrian. I left 2 of the four on my plate. My girlfriend had the black bean burger and was able to choke down about half. After the waitress brought our bill, I waited about 20 minutes then took the check up myself. The crappy service was tipped accordingly. Will never go back. Don't waste your time. There are many better bars and restaurants downtown.",

Only downside is that it can be somewhat noisy.  There is garage parking next to the restaurant that actually had a lot of spaces available when the restaurant was packed.  Overall, highly recommend this place!",

Great, modern atmosphere and vibe inside, friendly staff, and extensive menu with great food.  I enjoyed the gyro with fries last time I visited and loved it.  Fresh, flavorful and so tasty!  I can't wait to come back for martinis and more delicious food on that great menu!",

    "text": "I love this place (specially this new place on Portland Ave.) The food was same as always EXCELLENT! Although this time the service wasn't very good. I'm thinking FEZ got a new staff filled with new employees whom never been waiters before. I think a place like this should never hire inexperienced waiters. I mean, our waiter took forever to take our drink order THAT WAS A BAD START and from there he was late for everything.  He didn't do anything wrong, he just didn't have the experience to go in and out checking on us or other people (we were sitting outside..I don't want to think people who seat outside risk having a bad service). He didn't have that sense of urgency that we are all used to see at restaurants with these prices on the menu.  I was very disappointed and my fries got really cold and chewy just by waiting on more ketchup :/ I was really scared to ask for another glass of Stella.  I will still come back to this place because the burgers are to die for. I remember the name of the waiter but I won't say it here but he looks like he is a fan of The Cure If you know what I mean.",

They use a terrible delivery service that is not open during their operating hours. I tried getting a delivery two hours before the restaurant closed!! The experience is almost a bigger part of the restaurant than the food itself. They employ a cumbersome 3rd party website and at this point, after spending the last 30 minutes running in circles, I am just DONE. So disappointed.",

About 10 minutes later ... Still waiting!!!  No check and no food.  The waitress seemed surprised that we had no check and brought that back and then came the food.  Salad was ok nothing earth shattering for $18. Eh. It's probably ok for the $4 martini Tuesday's and apps but I wouldn't get lunch there again.",

    "text": "Went here for dinner tonight. The feta fries were great, the drinks were excellent and so were our entrees. The salmon on the salad was definitely fresh. Unfortunately I couldn't even describe the service as mediocre. When we wanted dessert, it took so long one of us just went to the hostess to ask her. When the server asked me if I wanted another drink, I had finished mine quite some time ago, and as good as it was, I wasn't about to spend that much longer there to enjoy the drink, so I declined. Of course the dessert was great, but the server had it on the receipt twice. I brought it to her attention, her only response was to tell me not to worry about it and she did not return with a corrected receipt. When I paid, she had not taken it off, and she was nowhere to be found again, so we ended up taking to the hostess again, as the manager was busy talking to another customer at the time. The hostess was apologetic, and when she had the server came up to correct the issue, her response was \"I'm sorry, mistakes happen.\"  Service here has been an issue several times here for the two that were here for dinner with me. Two of us would have ordered another drink if it was not for the server neglecting our table and we would have likely ordered more than just one dessert to split also.",
