So my son ordered a soda which was like $2.50 extra when he would have been happy with the free iced tea.  The salads came out with almost no dressing on them.  When I asked for more we were charged $.75 per salad for more.  Ordered a kids meal for my 6 year old.  Was brought out a regular sized meal.  When I asked the waitress informed me it was an adult portion.  When I said I wanted a kid meal she took the adult meal back and made us wait about 5 minutes for the kid portion to come back.  Had to ask for drink refills.  Waited forever for the bill and even longer for her to pick the bill up.",

My sons food came out first. it was good, he ordered the mac and cheese. my friend and I ordered the Manager's Special from the lunch menu.   Food was ehhhh.. literally. It lacked flavor, and spices. I didn't even finish my meal and that's saying a lot. I ordered my sons ice cream so he could have it before we left. The ice cream tasted like it had been stuffed in the back of the freezer and they had to pry it out of a snowmans hands to get a scoop for my son. It was so bad that my son didn't even finish it.   My advice, save your money, go to the grocery store and make your own meal, you'll get better service, food and leftovers at home.",

I've been to this location before and a few others in different cities.  It's always the same.  I'm looking for something good to eat that would want to bring me back and I've never had that experience here.  Plus there's like a million places in the Southeast Valley that are better, both chain and local.  Yeah the inside is nice, it's close to the mall, staff is fine.  Bla bla.  I even had the Mizithra cheese dish that people seem to rave about.  Buttered spaghetti with some cheese on it.  I make a better side dish in 10 minutes at home.  It is inexpensive, but then again so is Fazoli's.  I did kind of feel like they threw my precooked spaghetti into  hot water like they do at Fazoli's, but I just couldn't see them doing it.",

Walking in I felt like Gordon Ramsay walking into a failing restaurant. All chandeliers were old, dated, and ugly. They had red suede on the seats and some weird lady was singing  Natasha bedingfeilds song unwritten with really undeserved applause. The \"bartender\" was running the bar, seating area, and patio! He was nice and friendly. But obviously strained. Within the 40 minutes we were there we were served one drink and had to wave down the waiter to pay. There was literally one other couple there at the bar. So get this, as we were leaving the hosts said bye and as I turned to thank her she was already giggling and chatting with her coworker. Terrible experience. Don't go here. Never again. #disappointed",

The atmosphere is beautiful and elegant with many chandeliers and luxurious booths. There's also a cool old trolley that you can sit in for dinner. They have a nice patio that overlooks a water feature. This place is located in the Chandler Fashion Center, making it a very convenient location. Then you can go shopping after lunch or dinner!

I always get a small order of half mizithra cheese half clam sauce on angel hair (a must at this place for me), and it is fine, but definitely not worth the million calories that are in it.

    "text": "This was my first time to The Old Spaghetti Factory. I'm trying to decide if it will be my last. The food was good. The prices were good. The Minestrone soup was excellent. The service was....interesting, then confusing, then dissappointing. We arrived at 7:45pm and were seated in under 5 minutes despite it being a busy Saturday night. We got a semi private booth which was nice, but because it was next to the bar, there was no lighting. We literally had to use our cell phone flashlights to read the menu. Our server, Charlie, came up within 10 seconds after we sat down and the first thing he said was \"What can I get you to drink?\" We had just barely started to look at the menu (with our flashlights). I thought it was odd that he didn't welcome us, ask us if we had any questions about the menu, or acknowledge the lack of light even if there was nothing he could do about it. Just odd. Sit down BOOM what do you want to drink? We didn't get a chance to look at the cool beverage menu so we ordered or stand-by Diet Cokes because he was clearly in a hurry. Charlie then asked if we were ready to order. Wow, way too fast. I said \"It's our first time\" hoping Charlie would understand and introduce the menu, specials, etc. Nope. He said he was going to get a dessert order from the next table and hurried outside to what looked to be like a huge group. We soon realized that this group demanded all of Charlie's time and we were being served in the short 60 second-window he had between patio duties. The desert order must have been huge because we didn't see Charlie for a while. Finally we got our drinks. Charlie was nice, but his attention was obviously taken elsewhere. Since we didn't get order the minute we sat down, it was a while before Charlie came back to take our orders. Then he was back to the big outside group. No bread. My Diet Coke was constantly empty and no water was offered. He kept re-filling, but it took so long to get a re-fill. Finally we got our Bread, Soup AND Appetizer...all at the same time. And then Charlie was gone again. Now I promise this next part I am not joking, it couldn't have been more than 4 or 5 minutes after we got our bread, soups and appetizer - another server brought out our entrees. Seriously, we weren't even halfway through with our soup and hadn't even cut the bread yet. I'd had one bite of the appetizer and they brought out our entrees! Charlie must have wanted us out so bad in order to concentrate on his big party outside. I mean, who does that at dinner? Maybe in a lunch rush, but not for dinner. The server saw our table, and said \"Oh is this too soon?\" Duh. But we worried if we said yes, that they would just sit the plates under a heat lamp until we were ready. No thanks. So we just went with it. Our smaller, round table literally could not hold everything. We just wanted a nice dinner, but we were rushed through like cattle. I gave up hoping of always have something to drink with my food. We tried to make the best of it, because honestly the food was really good. Not great, but really good. I would rank Old Spaghetti Factory as one rung above food court pasta and one rung below Olive Garden. That's not a bad thing because the prices are very reasonable, especially with a little bowl of soup and a little scoop of ice cream. It's really good food. But oh my, the service. Perhaps our experience would have been different at another time with another server. Perhaps we just got caught in the vortex of a demanding, larger group in the same serving area. Perhaps as soon as Charlie realized we weren't ordering alcohol, and therefore not paying a big bill, he focussed on the groups that were, to ensure bigger tips. I don't know. It's always interesting to watch servers' faces drop when you order a Diet Coke. I watched disappointedly as a couple 2 booths down from us, who came in before us were served by another server who seemed attentive and helpful. I don't think their drinks ever reached the bottom before he refilled them. He offered fresh cracked pepper (which would have been really nice over my fettuccini alfredo), and it was obvious they had time to enjoy their appetizer and soups before their entree was brought out. I guess that's why I'm disappointed, is because I could clearly see what our experience was SUPPOSED to be like, but absolutely was not. We gave Charlie the benefit of the doubt that the big group must be very demanding to treat us like that. We gave him a normal 20% tip, even though the service was worth much less than that, because I don't believe in tipping less than 20% unless it's just a horrid experience. This was not horrid...it was interesting and disappointing. I wrote this note at the top of the receipt \"I'm sorry we caught you on a bad night. The food was really good though.\" Hopefully seeing a normal tip will help Charlie realize I'm not trying to be a jerk, but there was something way off tonight and he could have made it very different.",

    "text": "Well its 6 am and ive been up for hours sick adter eating here last night. Absolute worst restaurant experience I've ever had. Ordered our drinks, 1 beer and bottle of wine,  at approx 7:05-7:10... I kid you not, we got the beer delivered 10 minutes later and the bottle of wine at 7:38!!!! 7:38 exactly. We had to flag down 2 people and eventually the bartender brought it over. Our server was never to be found. The food and the manager were the only saving grace,  except mine of course because I'm sick now and can't keep anything down. On a different note,  The Vesuvius is the best.  If it didn't have meat (Im a vegetarian) then that'd be my go to meal. I ordered the managers special with marinara and Alfredo,  but got marinara and Mizithra. Nasty crap that Mizithra is, but its obviously subjective. I imagine that's why I'm sick.  It tasted horrible.  I didn't want to wait for the correct meal since we waited so long and I wanted to eat with my in laws who are in from out of town.  All in all, I'll never go to an OSF again. Worst service I've ever had.  Thank you to the manager who understood our frustration and dealt with our hangry selves. You were very sweet and we appreciate you.    Note: get the spumoni ice cream.  It'll change your life.",

Our waiter was basically useless, it took him forever to take our order and he never bothered to check on us through the whole meal. One of the highlights of The Old Spaghetti Factory is the fresh baked bread , yet for a party of 5 adults we got a single loaf not much larger than a roll.  We requested additional but didn't get it until about 20 minutes later when we made a 2nd request after having to flag our awol server who never stopped by to see how we were doing. The spaghetti had almost no sauce but we couldn't request additional because the only time the server was quick was when he fled the table after putting our plates on the table. He never bothered to check on refills for our drinks in fact it was my son's birthday and we wanted to order wine but even though we requested a wine list he never bothered  to come back and take our wine order. There are so many fine Italian restaurants in the Phoenix area I can guarantee that you will be able to find better food and SERVICE somewhere else.",

    "text": "We went here for my wife's birthday party and we had a group of 15.  We came on a Friday night @ 6 p.m.  The restaurant is large and can seat many people.  We were seated promptly.  We had 1 waiter for the group of 15 and I'll say he did a fair job.  He made sure our drinks were always topped off.  The minor problem I saw was the empties weren't being picked up so with 15 people, the glasses were piling up quick.  I won't fault him too much for that as we were a big group.  When our salads and bread came and we were finished, that's when we noticed the table was full of dirty dishes and here our food came.  Where do you put your dinner?  I wish the floor manager that night kept an eye on our large group because asking 1 person to do all of that work is a chore and a half and I understand that.  The food was good.  I ordered the #3 Meat Lover's Treat which came with 2 Sicilian meatballs, an Italian sausage and spaghetti with meat sauce.  The sausages and meatballs were really good and outshined the dish.  I would order it again.  As part of the dinner you get a dish of Spumoni which I had with our birthday cake we brought and the Spumoni was really good.  I'm not a big pasta fan so I would come back here and eat again, no problem.  Why I give the restaurant 3 stars is the location.  It's attached to the Chandler Mall and the parking is ridiculous.  After \"sharking\" the lot for 10 minutes we decided to valet park and that was $7 extra.  It's because of the parking problem I would choose to go elsewhere for my pasta fix where it is more convenient.",

    "text": "This restaurant hosted the Murder Mystery dinner thing recently.  We bought tickets through Groupon.  There were only three menu choices available, but I won't hold such details against Old Spaghetti Factory.  All I will rate is the food and service.  The Murder Mystery was a different company.  The salad that was presented was sad.  Truly sad.  This pathetic (and SMALL!) thing with a creamy dressing (and we weren't even allowed to choose the dressing!) is what gives salads a bad name.  Even my wife, who loves salads, didn't want it.    There was bread service, and the bread was fine.  A crusty sourdough.  I liked it.  Then the main course.  I got the \"spaghetti vesuvius\".  Supposed to be a spicy spaghetti with a rose sauce (tomato and cream), chicken and sausage and peppers.  The portion was very small (like a lunch special).  The flavor was fine.  Nothing special but fine.  It looked more appetizing than the salad, but still was sort of sad.  You'd think there was a food shortage or something, and we have this little portion that looks out of place with the size of the plate.  Even some fancy presentation would have helped (like you sometimes see in fancy places where there's not much food on the plate but they do something ornate in hopes you won't notice).  If the pasta hadn't been reasonably good (flavor) I would have to go with one star here.  The salad was pathetic.  The main course looked sad and impoverished.  And the dessert was this tiny scoop of neopolitan ice cream.  Emphasis on \"tiny\".  Service was reasonable.  Nothing extraordinary, but fine.  That and the taste of the pasta saved them from one star.  Normally I take half a meal home.  This one, which included dessert (which I seldom get) was barely enough to satisfy me.  I had no leftover.  In summary, I'd pass them by.  There are other Italian restaurants that have better food, and more of it.",

The wait staff was pleasant.  But the food, is right up there with the worst I have ever had.  Tasteless, commercial, barely edible.  I hardly cook, but I can do better spaghetti than this, drunk.  I don't write this review to keep you from going there.  No one review should form your opinion.  But my advice, is to limit yourself to appetizers, since the bar will probably be empty, so you can get right in.  In this way, you won't drop a load of cash, and you will have enough money left, to later go and get something to eat.  I have spent thousands of dollars in the Chandler Fashion Center area restaurants over the past few years.  I will never bother with this one again.",

    "text": "When i found out that this was being built, I was super excited to try it since I had heard so many great things about this restaurant chain. So, Friday night, I ordered my husband to meet me there. First things first, have fun finding a parking spot! Once inside, we waited about 15 minutes before being taken to a booth. The overall setup of the restaurant is very nice, spacious with very comfortable seating and a fun trolly car in the middle of the restaurant where they seat people as well. The aroma upon entering was very pleasant so I thought we were in for a delicious dining experience and that OSF had potential to be added to our restaurant rotation.  I was definately pleased when I saw the price of everything and that all meals included salad, bread, drink, and ice cream. Unfortunately, this was also a downfall because the cheaper the place, the more family friendly it is, hence more asshole kids! They were fricken everywhere, my head was spinning. I would like to add that if you have kids and they are screaming, get them the F out of the restaurant. Just because you think its adorable that little Johnny is banging his silverware around and screaming at the top of his lungs doesn't mean I enjoy it. In fact, one of these days, you are going to get punched in the face thanks to Little Johnny! Anyways, the husband and I, both having large appetites, each ordered platters. Me: The meat lovers treat which was spaghetti with meatballs and sausage (I tried it because it is the Old Spaghetti Factory after all and they should make good Spaghetti) and the hub chose the premier which was lasagna and chicken marsala. Both of us chose the salad with the creamy pesto dressing (they didnt have ranch and this was the closest dressing to it). We were off to a good start when the bread arrived hot and fresh, a lovely loaf of sourdough goodness. The salad, although consisting of only iceberg lettuce and a few carrots, was refreshing and acted as an excellent vehicle for getting the creamy and delicious dressing into my mouf! However, when the actual meals arrived, everything just seemed mediocre. The sauce on my spaghetti tasted jarred, didnt have much meat in it which was odd for a meat sauce, the meatballs were wayyyyyy too salty, and the sausage was your basic sausage, nothing special about it. The hub said his meal was very much the same, nothing great. In fact, at one point, he stated that he wished he was at Olive Garden. Unfortunately, I couldn't disagree. In any event, I decided to box up the remainder of my meal and we proceeded with eating our spumoni which obviously wasn't bad. How can you mess up ice cream though that is scooped from a bucket??? When leaving, I decided I wanted to go into the mall to see the puppies at puppies of love. Brings me such joy. Haha. I wasnt sure what to do with my box of leftovers but when thinking about it, I determined that they were not even going to get eaten so there was no point in taking it. All in all, if you are looking for cheap and your not a True Italian and dont care about True Italian food, then you might like this place. However, if you want GOOD spaghetti and meatballs, try Rigatonies (all their food is great) or Pesto's. Thank you very much   :)",

So I was very excited for the new location to open in Chandler and I knew that I would definitely be by for a visit! I went to this location for the first time with my parents. We ordered an appetizer, the Sicilian Garlic Cheese Bread (absolutely amazing!) and we each got a different entree. My dad loves spicy food, so he ordered the Spaghetti Vesuvius, which ended up not being spicy at all. My mom got the spaghetti with marinara sauce, which had absolutely no flavor. I got the spaghetti with the rich meat sauce which was tasty, but it could have had more flavor to it as well. Of course the spumoni ice cream for dessert was delicious. But we were not that impressed by the flavors of the food. I think I remembered that I loved the food so much because I was little and I didn't like spice. I think that the food items here are much better for children. On another occasion, we ordered OSF food for takeout while we were working. We got macaroni and cheese, spaghetti with marinara sauce, and the garlic cheese bread.. it was unanimous that the best thing out of all of those was the garlic cheese bread... needless to say we aren't going to be doing trade-outs with them anymore at work.",

Well the service was top-notch just like Lisa K. stated previously. This location was brand new and the staff seemed well trained and knowledgeable about the menu. Everyone was extremely friendly, personable and outgoing. The service made for a great experience. The prices are very reasonable considering the entrees come with tea or coffee (not soft drinks) and spumoni included. We ordered fried ravioli and cheese bread as appetizers. They both were delicious. My dad and I each ordered the Spaghetti Vesuvius which boasts a spicy and hearty combination or chicken, sausage and meatballs. The waiter even warned us that was very spicy. Not only was it not spicy, it didn't even have a slight kick to it.  The meat was used very sparingly in the sauce and the sauce was bland. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal. I tried my nieces spaghetti and meatballs. It was good. Not great, not overly flavorful but it tasted fresh, not fresh out of a jar. Would I come back here? Yeah probably. It has a great atmosphere and is good for groups like the one I was in. I think it would be worth giving another chance to.",

I usually have iced tea with dinner, as we all know, drinks are about $2.50 added to your bill...not here, the iced tea comes with your meal! You get an iced tea, hot tea, or coffee (yes, soda you do have to pay for), fresh piping hot bread with a garlic butter, a house salad or cup of soup (they've had a yummy and hearty, vegetarian minestrone both times), your entree (which are super cheap!), and a cup of vanilla ice cream or Italian spumoni (which is one of the better spumoni's I have had). I honestly don't know how they can afford to give so much food, for such a little price. Two people, that many items for $25.00? That's crazy! Just remember people...just because your bill is less than other places does not mean you should tip off of the bill! Think about the service your getting (mine has been out of this world fabulous both times) and all of the work that is involved (dishes, refills, courses, etc...). Tip on both price and service, then add a bit...don't be stingy.   Now for the entrees...I have gone off of recommendations both times, and both times I wasn't disappointed. The first time I went I tried their specialty the Mizithra Cheese & Browned Butter pasta (only $9.99). I wasn't sure what to expect but it came highly recommended. This was a very rich and scrumptious dish. It was a blast from the past, like a classier version of butter pasta you eat when you're a kid. I could only eat about half of it since it was so rich but my friend and I really enjoyed it...she ate more of mine than her own. I don't blame her, she got the fettuccine alfredo and it was not very good. The noodles were overcooked and the sauce was very bland...more like a milk based sauce instead of a nice creamy and cheesy sauce.  The second visit I tried another recommended dish, the Lasagna Vegetariano (only $10.50). Four cheeses, alfredo sauce, layers of noodles with fresh artichoke hearts, yellow squash, and zucchini. The top layer has carrots on top which I thought was a very unique and yummy idea. Then everything is topped with marinara sauce and delicious sauteed mushrooms. The presentation of the dish was very nice and the dish overall was not extremely flavorful, but considering it was vegetarian I thought it was very good. I would get it again.",

    "text": "In five bullet points:  *Good service. The waiter was attentive, and delivery was awfully quick. Their decor is also kinda tasteful too. *Really bland food. The menu is one of the shallowest I've seen from a real chain restaurant in years. The minestrone in particular had an issue, being spiked with some spice that way overpowered the flavor and made it horrid. The toasted ravioli appetizer was better than their \"signature\" cheese-butter pasta. *In hindsight, should have gone to CPK or somewhere else instead -- if you want real Italian, there are local and better chain places from which to get it -- Olive Garden (of which there is one across Chandler Blvd, north of the mall) and RigaTony's both come to mind. This is a restaurant for large families that need cheap, fast food. (This is probably why their meals are \"complete\" meals.) *The previous occupant of the OSF space was a restaurant called Garduno's, featuring Mexican food. They did better at food than OSF.  *How has this chain not only been in business for 42 years but expanded throughout the West and into select markets east of that? (St. Louis, Indy, Minneapolis, Louisville)",

Our server was great, prompt and very cheerful! I got a very basic spaghetti with marinara and I had no problems with it. I like that they include bread, soup or salad, and ice cream with the meal that you purchase. You even get to keep the glass when you buy a cream soda. Overall a great time and I liked the decor. I do wish the menu had some more options, though!",

The weather was beautiful today, 90 degree weather but overcast so more like warm winds.. As soon as we arrived at noon we were seated promptly and the waitress took our drink orders right away.. Their strawberry lemonade comes with unlimited refills for $2.50 (i think?) and it tasted great! They even gave us to-go cups to take some extra with us.. All pasta entrees are $1.50 cheaper on the lunch menu so my spinach and cheese ravioli went from $9.99 to $8.49.. Still a bit pricey but they do give you a generous portion like at cheesecake factory.. My friend ordered the baked lasagna (which is her all-time favorite food) and she said it passed her test! All in all I had a great experience and my server was extremely friendly.. We even got an extra loaf of their sourdough bread to take home [: I would return here again for sure!",

I had the cesar salad and vegetarian lasagna for dinner. I prefer a creamy cesar dressing but their dressing was watered down. And I'm not too keen on adding tomatoes to the salad. It was an interesting mix. My lasagna did not impress me at all. The pasta was way overcooked. It was like eating gooey noodles and the sauce was bland and chalky. The serving size was decent for the price although it was not appealing enough to make me want to finish the meal. My husband not wanting to waste food decided at the end of the dinner to box up my meal and have it for leftovers the next evening. My husband really loved his meal, angel hair pasta with white clam sauce. He said it was perfect along with his pomegranate long island iced tea. Maybe I was having a bad night, food wise. I would like to give this a place another chance. Just not anytime soon.",

    "text": "We had a party of 16 on a Sunday night.  We were greeted by a waiter with no personality.  Our drinks came on time. The salads were small and not at all what we thought they would be.  We had to ask to have the bread delivered to our table half way through the salads.  I ordered the Chicken Parmesan.  Here's where it all went bad.  The piece of chicken was 2 and a half by 2 and a half inches and the pasta was 3X3 inches.  I pointed this out to the waiter and by chance the manager was right there.  The manager was taken aback by my complaint of the portion size. He offered to bring me a larger piece of chicken but by now I was not in the mood so I asked to change my order to something else.  I can't believe they would plate something that bad and try to Serve it.  All of the pasta was under cooked and  everyone in the party agreed never to go back to this Spaghetti Company again.  We will go back to the Olive Garden or Carrabis for our Italian food.  This was a poor example of an Italian Restraint.  The manager needs to get in touch with the competition because at this point he is losing.  The moral of the story is when you are picking up a tab of $270.00 don't settle for a Baby Chicken and some under cooked Pasta.",

The fettuccine was barely warm and when I asked if I could get shrimp with it, the shrimp was served in a cold bowl on the side.  My daughter ordered pasta with a simple butter sauce and it too was served barely warm and the pasta was severely under cooked.  No one refilled our drinks, no one checked on our meal, and at one point I timed how long it took for our waiter to come back.  It was 17 minutes.  He was more concerned with the larger parties he had nearby, working the larger tip I assumed, than us.  When he asked how everything was, and I told him, there was no offer of any kind to make up for the sub-par food or the lack of service.  He simply replied \"I am in the weeds.\"  The best part of the meal was the bread.",

OK I can totally understand giving 1 star because you walked in and got ignored, however did you walk up and ask for a table. Seems a little weird that three people would just have a staring contest with you. It is possible, but not really probable.  Secondly, people griping about the PRICE.... ARE YOU SMOKING DOPE.... The basic meals here are between 10 and 15 bucks and INCLUDE DRINKS.   I read about people bitching about how bland it is.... Of course it's bland its a Family Eatery. They have to keep the basic food bland to suit all clientele. You can certainly request a little more this or that. NO this is not going to be the place to have a formal dinner with your grandmother from Italy. Yes, you will be put out that your dinner was not comparable to Tomaso's  which is a 15-25 dollar a plate spaghetti shop not INCLUDING DRINKS.  The food is on par with Olive Garden though the menu is not as deep.   You go to this place when its nice to have a night out, but you don't want to spend 60 bucks on a dinner for two. You go to this place when your a high school kid that wants to take his date out  and go to a movie or shopping over at the fashion square. You go to this place when you want a nice value dinner that includes a great ambiance,  a nice staff, and a fun location for activities afterward.",

I dont know what the big hype is with this place, this isn't real Italian and its nothing to write home about, there was nothing to be impressed with from the soups to the lame salads to the meal - all was mediocre and if you ask me they charge to much for the quality of the food.

    "text": "This was my first visit to this new location of OSF in the chandler mall, and I'll tell you right now, I don't know if the other locations are this bad, but I will not be returning... If you're wondering why, read on, you'll see.  ---Service--- We had a table of 10, which i understand can be difficult, but in a restaurant this big that seats probably 150 people or so, they shouldn't have trouble with a table of 10. We were seated promptly enough, and our waitress took drink orders while we were still waiting for half of our crew. Once everyone else showed up she took their orders, but completely forgot my friend. He eventually got a water, but by that time we were about half way done with our meal. When the food that we ordered arrived, my friend who didn't get a drink also didn't get his entree. It came out about 5 minutes after everyone elses. My wife and I ordered garlic cheese bread as an appetizer and we didn't get it until 10 minutes after we were done eating dinner. The waitress said the kitchen was backed up, which I don't buy at all. She simply forgot to place the order until i mentioned it was missing, plain and simple. When the bill came we noticed that the two drinks we ordered were missing from the tab and we notified the waitress of her mistake. What she should have done was apologize for the poor service and numerous mistakes she made and comp'd the drinks and the garlic bread, but instead she corrected her mistake and she threw away an opportunity win some brownies points and any kind of a reasonable tip. Sadly, this had to be some of the worst service I've received at a restaurant in recent history.  ---Atmosphere---- As far as the restaurant itself is concerned, they did a really good job converting a rather eclectic Mexican place into a nicely furnished and modern feeling Italian joint. Our party was seated closer to the front of the restaurant, and because they left the outer doors of the two doored entry way wide open, whenever anybody would come inside there was a giant gush of cold air that would sweep in, making everyone at my table cold while trying to enjoy out no-longer-hot food. What's the point of having two entry doors if you leave the outside doors wide open!! Seriously people. It was pretty noisy and chaotic inside as well. All the waiters and waitresses seemed to be running around like chickens with their heads cut off. The nature of the building also lends itself to being acoustically boisterous, that is to say, this isn't the place to come if you're in the mood for a quiet dinner with your loved one.   ----Quality---- None of this even speaks to the quality of the food, which is to say, quite sub par considering the prices on the menu. My wife and I ordered the whole wheat spaghetti with mushrooms and marinara sauce. The portion size was smaller than average for a $10 plate, and the sauce was way to wet and there was way to much of it. My spaghetti was drowning in a thin red soup. I've made better at home! My brother in law ordered the chicken parm and his meal was just as bland and boring. The serving of spaghetti he got was tiny, and the chicken breast wasn't even breaded, which may be healthier for you, but it's not chicken parm unless that chicken is deep fried and crispy. The salad we got before the meal was sub standard by any means, low quality ice berg with a few tiny croutons. The creamy pesto sauce that came with it was good, but not so good that it warrants drowning your lettuce in it (which is was). The cheesy garlic bread that we received ten minutes too late was actually pretty decent although a bit greasy for my taste. The sourdough bread was fresh and warm, however, don't expect to get a fresh loaf if the kitchen is out of knives, apparently they won't bring you one unless they have a fresh knife to give you as well. The ice cream we got after the meal was decent enough, I enjoyed the flavor of the spumoni, however, there were ice crystals in it, which leads me to conclude the ice cream tub had been left out and refrozen after a while, ruining the smooth texture it should have. There's no excuse for that.   ---Summary---- I don't give out 1 star reviews very often, as I'm usually easier to please, but last night it seemed like it was consistently one thing after another that just piled on top of each other. Eating here made me long for olive garden, which at the very least is quieter and as far as I can tell, has much better food. I can only imagine what the lease is costing them for that location, and I'm sad to say it, but I actually hope they go out of business to save anyone else from the experience of dining there. Maybe they can turn things around, maybe they can't. From the other reviews I've seen so far, it appears as though they're making a habit of pissing off their customers. So there's nothing left to say but good riddance, I hope whoever takes over that space next actually puts some thought into how to run a restaurant.",

    "text": "This OSF just opened up nearby at the Chandler Mall so we decided to give it a try one night for dinner.  I ordered the Garlic Mizithra and the BF had the Premier (Lasagna & Chicken Marsala combo). We also got a side of two meatballs to share. All entrees come with a soft drink, soup or salad and ice cream at the end. The bf chose the soup (minstrone) and I chose the salad (garden salad). The soup was gross. The salad was blah. The honey mustard dressing was yummy though. The bread and butter they offered was better than I expected. It was a fresh loaf of sourdough. Nice, crispy and slightly chewy. Our entrees came and I was quite surprise with my dish. It was spaghetti tossed in butter with bacon bits, mushrooms and mizithra cheese. I couldn't stop eating it. The bits of cheese was delightful and there was tons of it tossed in. I liked that it wasn't salty but a soft subtle flavor. I thought the lasagna was decent and the marsala was alright. My BF really enjoyed them. The meatballs were okay. I can't say much about them. At the end of our meal we had a choice of a scoop of ice cream (spumoni or vanilla with chocolate sauce). We chose one of each. They were nothing special but a nice little treat to seal up our dinner.   With two 20oz beers our total came out to around $45 before tip. I thought it was of fair value. I'd probably go back just for the Garlic Mizithra. Everything else was nothing memorable.",

The meatballs in the meatball sliders had excellent flavor, but generally speaking the sweet Hawaiian rolls they were served on were not a favorite.

Our main courses were good, but the best part was the gelato afterward.",

She was attentive, familiar with what was vegan on the menu (!!!!!) and always making sure our drinks were filled up. Definitely ask for her when you come! I will when I go back for sure. It's always a good dining experience when the staff is as helpful and kind as the food is delicious.   This was an A+ experience. Very happy.",

We had to request a round of refills since nobody bothered to refill our drinks after at least 20 mins of empty glasses for the entire table. Orders were messed up, we ordered a few Italian sodas that come with a keepsake glass. When I asked for a bag or box to carry them home in they offered to get clean ones and bag them. I got home to find that they wrapped dirty glasses. My sister's card was charged for the wrong table. They apologized and said the second charge shouldn't clear her account. Overall we give it one star since the food was edible (not great) and the service left much to be desired.   If you enjoy empty drink glasses, wrong food orders, dirty keepsake glasses and surprise charges on your card then this is your place.",

That was about the only thing that was right.  The waiter comes over and takes our order. We order grilled cheese with apple sauce for my grandson and I ordered a soup with my meal.  All of a sudden another server comes out with apple sauce and soup for my grandson. I was like the soup is for me not him.  He takes the soup back and brings me mine. Then the food comes. All good there.  In the meantime drinks get refilled but we're not clearing any empty glasses or dishes. Then we get dessert still with all other plates. Now I'm feeling crowded and getting a little agitated. I placed a to go order with a salad.  What do I get?   Soup!  Like seriously who is checking these orders.  I tell the waiter I got soup and he's like,\" what did you want with it?\"  Thinking to myself, \"you took the order you should know.\"  I also had stuff I was bringing home from my meal and my grandsons. The waiter asks, \"would you like a small or large box?\"  I'm thinking to myself you're the server you would have a better idea which I would need. So I say the small and it was too small.  So I ask for a larger box and it was like a big joke to him. I don't understand what the heck he was thinking. And then to get the bill of $46 and crappy service really just irritated me altogether.  All the while the table is still full of dirty dishes and now I'm trying to pay. I have nowhere to move plates to sign for my purchase. I should have just left. I used to have such good memories at Old Spaghetti Factory.  Tonight, obviously, not so good",

I love the ambiance, especially the old trolley car and the headboards between the booths. And it has a classy feel without being stuffy. Unfortunately they have a raging mosquito problem and it's been noticeable just about every time I've eaten here. I've spoken to management and they're aware of the problem and working on it.  The staff has always been pretty friendly and quick to help with anything needed.  I really miss the spaghetti squash, which they don't carry any more. But I'll continue coming here.",

To this day it is a standing joke in our home to say lets go to the old spaghetti factory because the memory leaves us laughing because it was so so bad.",

Our server Nathan was very attentive without being bothersome, even though we may have been his only table at this late hour.  We had the meals which included salads, and my wife had her usual ranch dressing and I had my usual honey mustard.  Salads were crunchy and fresh and we did not feel that they had been sitting for awhile and were fresh.  My wife had the angel hair pomodoro and loved it.  I was fairly hungry so I went for the meat lover's sauce over angel hair pasta.  Tasty and rich sauce.  We both had Widmer Hefeweizens to accompany our meals, and topped it off with complimentary spumoni  at the end.  A very pleasant and intimate late night treat!",

Garlic cheesy bread was delicious, the chicken piccata good, but the cheesy pasta it comes with wasn't great and that's one of their signature dishes. My husband had the spaghetti and, and it was so plain and bland. I do like how they give a scoop of ice cream at the end of every meal, that was a nice touch. My son's Mac and cheese also had no flavor. So just not enough to bump it up to 4 stars, but almost.",

The second my tea was empty, it was promptly replenished. WITH a new lemon. Every time. The same went for out salad dishes; they were gone as soon as our salad was done!  Cory was seriously one of the best waiters we've ever had. He was kind, attentive and funny and we replay enjoyed his company as a waiter! He had the best timing; I was very impressed. I can honestly say I've never had such great service.  Regarding the food, for the money, it is a very great deal. It's cheaper than Olive Garden (which I now hate in comparison) and even includes spumoni.   We both started with salads. I love their vinaigrette and the fact that the bowls were cold. We also received some hot bread which was pretty standard.  For the actual entree, I had the manager's special with the marinara and the cheese and browned butter sauce (which were both pretty awesome) and my father had the chicken parmesan. He thought the chicken was good, but would have preferred it to be a little thiner, but he scarfed it down (and he is an italian food snob). Otherwise, I mean, come on.. They even have gluten free pasta! That's awesome! We also ordered a side of broccoli which was the perfect compliment to our meal.  We finished off with the spumoni (included) and it was the perfect end to a great meal!  I am very impressed with this place and will definitely be back!",

I showed up fashionably late to attend a birthday party dinner, took a quick trip to the restrooms(liked the decor of the restaurant)and upon returning to the table was surprised to see no menus, nor drink orders taken, no plates for the bread, no servers around. When we finally got our orders in it felt as though we had to repeatedly ask for everything, especially drinks, and they completely forgot my daughter's drink. I'm not picky but if my glass is always empty the tip goes down, like father like daughter I suppose. I ordered the spaghetti Vesuvius, suppose to be spicy, it was barely above regular sauce. Although the sauce was chunky it was placed in a spoonful a top cold bland noodles,not enough sauce to cover it. I realize we were a big party but reservations were made. Food was bland, service was slow, will I return most definitely no.",

We were seated right away, which was nice, and the table was very clean. The server, however, had a \"too cool for this\" attitude, complete with slumping against the post of our booth.  When my soup arrived, it was room temperature, not even warm. My mother's was the same way... I didn't eat much, it wasn't that appetizing. When my main meal came around, (I got the baked chicken), again, my spaghetti was room temperature and the chicken was not that great either; it was definitely on the drier side (however, the Mizithra cheese that they put on the spaghetti was the best thing I've ever eaten). My mom, who ordered the same entree, said hers was about the same as mine only warmer. The bread that we got with our meal was probably the best part. It was flavorful and fresh - very yummy.  All in all, decent service, cool decor, mediocre food. I don't know that I'll be returning.",

I suggested OSF and after googling it, realized that there was one right here at the Chandler Fashion Center.  this means I don't have to schlep all the way downtown anymore!  YES!  This particular location has only been open a year as of this month.  Place is huge, and decorated nicely!  Huge fluffy red chairs, chandeliers, large seating booths for big parties, and a big dining room in the front.  We were greeted by our server who took our order.  She was really good, and treated us great.  I went with the angel hair spaghetti, and my friend went with some other pasta dish that I can't remember.  We got bread sticks, drinks, and spumoni for dessert.  I would gladly come here again, as I always love dining here, as it brings back so many memories for me.  Keep up the good work OSF, I love you!",

One friend ordered the meat sauce, the other the Sicilian meatballs and I ordered mushroom spaghetti. The minestrone consisted ENTIRELY OF BEANS--no tomatoes, no pasta! The ice tea was so dark that it looked like motor oil! One Sweet & Low in one glass is usually enough but this tea was so strong that I couldn't even taste it! When I took a few bites of my mushroom spaghetti, I noticed it was extremely watery. I used some Parmesan to see if it became thicker and it didn't. Out of frustration, someone walked by and asked if every thing was alright. I said no! Told them how watery my mushroom spaghetti was and they credited my entree. My other two friends ate their food and although they didn't like their food either, they tolerated it. They left a bill for the $1.08 iced tea. My friend Sue said now we remember why we stopped eating here. Olive Garden has a special this week and is better than the Original Spaghetti Factory! If you want good Italian food, do NOT GO HERE!!!",

We were desperate and Olive Garden is just meh to us. We only enjoy their free bread and salad so that was out of the question. After quite some time, we decided on Old Spaghetti Factory... I took her here once for her birthday and the food was decent so we decided to give it another go.  This time around, it wasn't all that great. The waitress seems to be all over the place. I had to ask twice for the water to be refilled. When we order she also ask us \"lunch or dinner\" portions but completely left out what the difference was.   Anyways to the food.  We were all hungry so the appetizer was quickly devoured. The sausage and cheesy garlic bread was pretty good, my brother seems to enjoy it a lot but the olive tapenade was just okay, nothing special.  Oh and on another note the free bread should have been brought out with the appetizers, no? It was brought out with our food...  So yeah, the food came out and it wasn't all that good. The marinara sauce was a little on the sour side. And it seems like all their dishes use that one sauce. Needless to say, very dissapointing. All 5 dishes... from lasagna to chicken parmesan to silicon meatballs .... all taste the same...  I don't think I will be returning.",

The boys wanted to sit inside one of the trolley seating areas and my wife and I told the lady who was seating that it didn't matter how long the wait was, wed be happy to wait for that specific seating. The lady, who I believe was one of the evening managers took down our name and we asked her if we could enjoy the outside patio and purchase cocktails while waiting. She told us that would be fine and she would let us know when our inside seating would be available. An hour and a half goes by and I went to double check to see if our seating was finally available as we had heard nothing. We had ordered a few appetizers and cocktails while waiting to keep our sons happy. When I checked on the again on our seating, the lady admitted she accidentally gave away our seating. Our sons and my wife were devastated! I could not believe she had done this after how polite we had been and patient. Also upping their sales in cocktails and appetizers. One of the servers saw that my wife was very sad and she immediately went to talk to her food manager, Mr. Moore. He immediately remedied the situation, was very kind, went beyond the call of duty to ensure the sons and wife were comfortable. He saved the evening. Because of Mr. Moore, we have been back approx three times within the last two weeks. It seems as though half the staff is amazing and the other staff is not happy working there. It's such a wonderful time at this location when the staff seems friendly and happy to see us. Great job, Mr. Moore.",

We got calamari and spinach dip for apps which were not good.  The salad was a joke. Obviously just bagged iceberg lettuce. No other ingredients  but lettuce and dressing.  My hubby and I ordered the chicken licata and it was oily and salty. The only part of the meal that tasted good was the ice cream at the end.  Also the apps, salad and entrees all came out within minutes of each other. Super disappointing experience. Definitely wont go back.",

What a mistake and it won't happen again.  The inside is beautifully decorated even with a streetcar setting with booths.  The server was excellent and so was the food.  There were four of us and we were all pleased with the food we were served and even the bill.  We felt it sure beat Olive Garden!",

He moved fast and did his best to accommodate our large party. He needs a raise",

We have  tried multiple things of the menu.  From lasagna to the taste of Italy,  the mitzritha and brown butter sauce (yum) they even offer gluetin free pasta now!!! A decent house wine and mixed drinks.  Love the atmosphere, and decor. The kids enjoy it too and love to visit! They like the ice cream that comes with their meals (they never really get sweets,  so it is a very special treat) I love that even if we have a large group or it is just me and the hubbs we get the same great service.",

It sorta reminded me of that place but with a nicer dining area.   I had the pot poutti, it's a sampler so I got to try the Mizirtha cheese and brown butter sauce, the meat sauce, the clam sauce, and the marinara sauce.  All of the sauces tasted pretty good (especially the meat sauce). The pasta wasn't over cooked either so the food is fairly solid.  Head and shoulders above Olive Garden.  The thing that ruined the experience was that everyones entree came out lukewarm.  I hate that (that alone takes them from a generous 4 star to a solid 3 star).",

The  spaghetti is al dente, fresh and consistently great. Sure, I've tried different things on the menu but generally, My order is always the same which cuts back on complaining!   Mazithra cheese with brown butter is my go to. I know it's a little salty, but with sourdough bread and butter (you can request olive oil), creamy pesto salad and a lil Spumoni, it all comes together.   Tonight, I was solo and even though the dining and a huge private patio party was packed, service at the bar was smooth, friendly and quick. Couldn't be happier!   Great for huge group parties, big family dining and a quick inexpensive bite for 1-10.",

Once our drinks were delivered mine had a bug in it as well as a clear shard of plastic. Really..? You didn't notice that when you were making the drink? I let the bartender know and he got me a new drink which also had a bug in it. I sent it back and declined another drink. After receiving our food something caught my eye right above and slightly behind my boyfriends head. A swarm of gnats was actually circling near the wall that separated us from the servers walkway. I couldn't stop staring at them. I told my boyfriend but I guess from his angle and the light he really couldn't see the tiny bugs flying near his head.  The prices really don't match the food y ou get. They really should lower their prices. The salad is pathetic with its place iceberg lettuce and basically no dressing.  The pastas we ordered were bland and tasteless. The only decent thing was the spumoni you get at the end of your meal.  I was so uncomfortable here I don't want to ever go back. Every time my boyfriend asks if we should try them again all I can think of are those bugs and I veto the option immediately. We love RigaTony's and Oregano's; WAY better food, great service, and an inviting atmospheres. Please trust me and MANY of reviewers, just don't waste your time or money coming here.",

The waitress was very polite got our drinks and took our appetizer order. I do recommend the garlic fries, as long as you love garlic! We all ordered our entrees and incidentally we all got the minestrone soup before our pasta. The minestrone soup was much better than Olive Garden I will say. Our pastas arrived the food was hot but not particularly flavorful. Overall a decent dining experience but nothing to get excited over.",

Usually, we go to the location in Central Phoenix, but I wanted to check out the newer location at Chandler Fashion Mall. It is located in the old \"Gardunos\" restaurant building.  The first thing that impressed me was that the lighting was 150% better than the previous restaurant.  Old Spaghetti Factory is not fancy or pretentious and very affordable. For the 2 of us the total bill was $26.00.  We opted to sit in the lounge/bar area, usually I am leery of sitting in that section at any restaurant due to lousy service. We were pleasantly surprised by the capable hostess/bartender who was working that night. She handled all the food and drink orders for the whole section with great professionalism. If any criticism can be made of the food it would be that the salad was very generic, but other than that it was a great dining experience. I had crab stuffed ravioli, very tasty indeed! The best part is that dessert (ice cream or sherbert) is included in the price of an entree. We will definitely eat there again.",

Our waitress was actually really awesome- she got us our drinks quickly and was super friendly with our touristy butts. Yeah... it's a chain. I know the food isn't the best and the service can be hit or miss. But the stars are all for our waitress, whose name I (of course) can't remember.

We had a group of about 60 going out for dinner after an event, and after two other restaurants couldn't take our reservation, OSF popped into my head as an option, and luckily they were able to take our group on a few days' notice.   I talked with the managers a few time to figure out what would be the best plan of action for our large group, and we decided to do the family style dinner that was a flat charge per person, with bread, salad, pasta, and ice cream for everyone. We were seated in the banquet hall which is pretty nice at 3 long tables, and we had to wait a few minutes but they started to get everything rolling out pretty quickly. I have to say everything tasted great, by far better than a similar deal at *cough bucco di beppo cough*. I think everyone got their moneys worth and then some.   The only reason I have to give them 4 stars instead of 5, is because when making arrangements, I was told that we would be able to have separate checks. Well, at the end of dinner, we got one check that we had to split amongst everyone, which ended up being a minor pain. But the servers were super nice and did the best to make the process easy and painless. I'll definitely be beck",

This is my first, but when I saw the feedbacks I just had to step in.   My husband and I have been going there since we moved into the area. Their meals are a great value. 11.79 for a very reasonable portion of your entree ( if you are a big eater you will have to pay a little extra for the hearty portion); and it also comes with a soup or salad, bread and a little scoop of ice cream for desert. Really? I was reading the complains and I was just cracking up because some were complaining about the price lol Anyway, we love this place so much that we had our rehearsal dinner here and the service was extremely accommodating and patient. For whatever reason people at my party of 40 came in waves. They all were from out of town so we couldn't make it all at the same time. They still were patient and gave is great great service. Gave us time to mingle and once we ordered, food was right out. We had a great time that eve and all the other eves that we been there.  The decorations is highly pleasant to the eyes.

They bring a nice warm loaf of french bread with your included chilled salad.  Add a glass of cabernet wine, and top it off with spomoni ice cream - and it is a great meal.  The bar is nice and large - and a great place to sit and have dinner if you are just a single.  The bartender is always pleasant and knows how to take care of you with great service.

This was only the second time I had eaten their and in both cases I felt the same.  I guess if you have alot of extra money and want to try something different the Old Spaghetti Factory is your place.  Otherwise their are other places that can give you a better meal for the buck.",

But I found it odd that it was so quiet.  No music, no A/C humming...just awkwardly quiet.  So quiet that other diners could easily hear my conversation and I could hear theirs.  FOOD: My 'salad' was a bowl of iceberg lettuce with 4 shoestring carrot pieces.  My child's mac-n-cheese looked more like pasta with a small bit of butter. My pasta was ok.  Not great, not awful, but not worth the price on the menu.  The presentation/visual appeal was lacking on all items - no 'wow' factor.  SERVICE: Our waiter was pleasant but got 2 out of our 4 orders wrong.",

We went in earlier than the rest of the group and wound up sitting with the group from Toronto by mistake due to miscommunications on our parts; our group had a different reservation two hours after we arrived and we were not informed of it. Now, onto the food. The bread, I could tell just by looking at it, was either made in a steam injected oven or the bakers sprayed it with water. In any case, I was impressed. The bread was served piping hot and was so good it didn't need any butter. I ordered the chicken broccoli fettuccine and my husband ordered the chicken parmigiana; both of us ordered minestrone soup and spumoni. The soup was not half bad; in fact it was one of the few times I have seen both pasta and zucchini in a minestrone. The fettuccine was good. I found the alfredo sauce a bit on the greasy side, but was pleasantly surprised that they added a touch of white wine to it, much as I do. My husband adored his chicken as far as I can tell; it's quite difficult to screw up anything parmigiana. The spumoni was good and just the right portion for a single person after a starchy meal.",

We were running errands and wanted to eat early and get home.  They were serving all day,which is a major plus. The hostess gave us lunch menus along with our dinner menu. However, lunch had been over for 25 min. Anyway, our waiter was nice. He bought our drinks and bread quickly. The food is very cheap (price wise) . So for the $$ you cannot complain. But, it really has no flavor, it is very plain. We both chose the soup. Which was really good, Minestrone. Food was good , just not a lot of flavor. Of course it is an Italian place owned by Greeks so they will have things a little differant. After we got our food we sat for a very long time with no drink. Our waiter seemed to of disappered for 20 min. Maybe they have things to do in the back before their shift ends. but, the hostess walked by us several times. I think she should of asked us if we wanted refills. Not a bad place, just not a great place. It served the purpose of a quick , fairly good dinner. They are doing something right, they have been around for years.",

The ravioli was akin to the kind I imagine you would buy from the freezer section at Wal-Mart. The bread tasted like saltine crackers. The service was very good however and the spumoni ice cream was good. My bf really liked the fettucine alfredo. They did offer to replace my entree with something else since I didn't eat it, so I got some fettucine alfredo to go. I have a Groupon to come here with my son for a murder mystery dinner in a few weeks...hopefully the food then will be better.",

The decor is appealing, the food is decent for the price, the service is friendly, and all in all is a good experience. It's a best seller for kids, and there's nothing not to enjoy of this place if you know that you're going to an inexpensive place to put something in your stomach after some shopping or a movie.  Remember, this is a chain that started in Portland with the vision of feeding the family for a reasonable price focused in the whole dinner (meaning that your entree comes with soup or salad and desert).  The spumoni is delicious!  So, if you're leaving the mall or the movies and you need a quick bite that won't hurt your finances and the food will taste good, and the decor and service are great, this is your joint!",

    "text": "Regardless of how impeccable the service, I won't eat anything but the cheesy bread here voluntarily.  ...and I have eaten here a LOT.  This place is fairly easy to find: it's in the outdoor segment of Chandler Fashion Center, and is by the parking lot.  The decor is awesome...seriously, amazing.  Every seating area is unique and has its own charm.  From a romantic date to a huge familly, there is an area of the seating chart that is meant for you.  I love it...it helps me get through dinner, honestly.  The meals all come with the bread, salad, and spumoni (italian neopolitan ice cream), so you pay for everything in the price of your entree...honestly, that's a good deal.  The wait staff is phenomenal; they're always helpful, friendly, there when you want them, yet unobtrusive and quiet.  We've stopped the manager several times to praise an employee's outstanding service, so they are making the right hiring decisions.  The first time we ate here, I had ravioli and hubs had the rich meat sauce spaghetti.  It was easily the least flavorful ravioli I have ever eaten.  The saucing was sparse and had no boldness.  I'm not a huge fan of the sourdough bread.  The spumoni was FANTASTIC, but that was after I hated all the food and hey, I already love ice cream.  On the opposite end, my husband LOVED his food.  I tried it and thought it was the most boring spaghetti I have ever eaten.  There was nothing rich or meaty about the sauce--I personally think jar spaghetti sauce tastes better.  Second time, had the spaghetti squash; this was better, but just was interesting texturally more than taste wise. This time we had the cheesy garlic bread.  THIS is their best item.  It's melty, cheesy, garlicy wonderful on a still crisp perfect loaf.  I ate this happily and finally had a good mood after coming here.  Third time I tried the spaghetti with the light sauce, also same thing: it's so BLAND!  Seriously, I would guess that only those recovering or on plain diets would like this food...I can't fathom why my husband likes it (he keeps picking it when it's his turn, which is why I keep giving other menu items a chance...I have no choice except not to eat!).  I LOVED OSF in Houston, Texas, so I don't know what is up with this location, but it is just such bland food!  I don't like the lasagna, spaghetti, ravioli...so what exactly is the point of eating here???  I love my husband, that's basically it.  I've started getting takeout here so he can eat his boring spaghetti and I can pick up authentic Italian from elsewhere.  I feel badly because this place has such a good atmosphere and great staff, but I just don't care for the food.  I've had spaghetti, ravioli, and lasagna in Italy repeatedly, so maybe I just prefer the fresh flavorful experience and can't resign myself to this place's humdrum attitude toward food.  I still say save your $40 and go to Vincitorio's!!!",

When our salad/soup came, we had no place settings or silverware and had to wait until someone passed by.

    "text": "So we love OSF and have visited the downtown location many times. This location fell short of our expectations, I would not recommend you eat here and I will not repeat.   If you want more details read on:   Julie said that 1. It was my turn to change the diaper and 2. A family restaurant like OSF would most definitely have baby changing tables in the men's room. Well, if those exist they hide them well, I will mention that both the stalls were busy so I was not able to look in there for a changing table so I had to change him on the sink which was less than pleasant.   Next, we sat about 40-60 feet away from the front door in large, red Alice in Wonderland type chairs. Although charming and comfortable, these chairs are little to tall for a short guy like me and my legs would not touch the floor! I had to do the slide-down-the-chair-to-touch-the-floor-so-I-feel-like-a-big-boy routine.   Then I noticed that the first set of double doors from the outside were propped open so every time someone opened the inside set of double doors to walk in or out, a huge breeze of 39 degree F air would come rushing in and give us a great \"Arctic\" atmosphere. This bothered me enough to call Sean, our waiter, over. I explained the issue and he quickly went over to the hostess station where four girls with the apparent combined IQ of 50 argued with him for a few minutes and it seems that Sean lost the argument because the doors remained propped opened until about an hour later when a customer must have accidentally kicked the prop and made the outside doors close on his way out. Who is the genius that decided to prop them open in the first place with the kind of weather we were having?   I ordered a Chicken Penne and Sean said that it came with a salad. The \"salad\" was just a bunch of lettuce in a puny bowl with some dressing. It left me wondering why we didn't just go to Olive Garden to get a real salad.   Then came the bread. It tasted good but it was hard, cold and difficult to cut. Even little Ryan at 2.5 years old gave me a weird look when he tried biting into the bread.   The bread came served in a puny cutting board which the more we cut the bread the more crumbs and hard crust went every were on the table and made a huge mess. I would recommend you bring some safety glasses and a cordless sawzall for this operation. I was not impressed. Why not send the bread pre-cut or in a plate more suited for this purpose? Hey how about sending FRESH bread out?   The food came fast so I got my Chicken Penne and it was just OK, very unremarkable. Again, it left me wondering why we did not just drive a bit further and eat the Pene Rustica at Macaroni Grill which is a dish that deserves a standing ovation.   The beer was tasty and the rest of the meal was enjoyable now that I was wearing my jacket fully zipped up and was starting to contemplate wearing my gloves also for good measure.   IQ 50 girls were still giggling by the hostess station.   Then I overheard three employees talking a few feet away from us by the terminal. They were discussing restaurant drama, something about \"he almost got me fired but I apologized to the customer and still got a good tip\"   Now, let me tell you that besides being a patron, my extent of having any restaurant management experience involves working at Pizza Hut for two months as a waiter during summer break in college but even I know that discussing drama within earshot of customers is unprofessional and should be taken outside or in the kitchen. I began fantasizing about being \"manager for a day\" as I already had a list of the top ten things that this restaurant needed to address if it planned on staying in business.   At this point in the meal I was looking around to see if I could determine who the Manger is and maybe call him or her over.   Could it be the girl that was dressed in white, different from the other employees dressed in black? No, she was hanging out with IQ 50 girls for a long time, probably not.   Julie also made an observation that they appeared to be waaayyy overstaffed. Julie worked in a restaurant as a lead where dollars sold per labor hour were the important to keep high for their bonuses. This was apparently not the focus here as there were loads of employees standing around and circulating the restaurant aimlessly carrying nothing and doing nothing.   The positives:   Sean was a great waiter, professional, courteous, prompt and was there just in the nick of time when needed. Sean is probably the greatest asset this company has going for it.   For his sake, I hope Macaroni Grill is hiring as I think this restaurant is going under within the year.   The building is nice, kept relatively clean and the music and ambiance is pleasant (besides the Arctic issue)   But again I will not repeat.",

    "text": "My fiance and I dined here last night and we were very disappointed. When we first walked in the door we were not greeted even though the hostess was standing at the entrance. She seemed very distracted and it took her about five minutes to even notice that we were there. Once we were seated it took probably another ten minutes before anyone ever took our drink order or introduced themselves. Eventually a woman came over, I still do not know her name because she did not introduce herself and she said she was a manager and would be taking our order because our server was running behind.  I ordered the penne with marinara and alfredo sauce with chicken which was a recommendation from the manager that took our order. My fiance had the lasagna. It took about fifteen minutes for our food to come out which wasn't bad but it was horrible once we started eating. The chicken in my penne dish was rubbery and tasted freezer burned and days old. Definitely not cooked fresh. The lasagna that my fiance had seemed like something that had been frozen for months and then quickly heated up in the microwave. I wanted to send my dish back but once again there was no server to be found. My fiance had to eventually ask the bartender to find a manager. Ten minutes later we finally had someone over to our table. I told her that the chicken was really bad and that I would like something else. I ended up just getting the garlic and brown butter sauce on spaghetti. It was not to bad but pretty bland and nothing to write home about. Overall the service was really lacking and the food was terrible. The only thing that I enjoyed was the Italian cream soda and the bread which isn't saying much.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. If you are around Chandler Mall waiting to see a movie, go to BJ's or California Pizza Kitchen. Much better service and food.",

    "text": "This was my first, and probably last, venture into OSF at Chandler Mall.  The service was first rate.  Our waitress was very attentive and well-trained.  The decor was lovely and invoked a Disney-esque atmosphere of a real \"spaghetti factory\".  Everything was clean and the front of house greeters couldn't have been nicer.  Here's the bad news: the food was, to put it politely, not very good.  Our table of four ordered two spaghetti with meatball dinners and two lunch portion spaghetti with marinara.  All of the entrees came with a very pedestrian cup of bagged lettuce mix with choice of dressing and drinks of choice.  The dinner choices included a dessert of spumoni ice cream.  The lunch portions did not.  Allow me to state that I am not a food snob.  Noodles and sauce can be very satisfying under almost any conditions.  In fact, I wondered out loud in the middle of lunch, \"How could anybody screw up spaghetti?\"  Here's the answer:  Jar.  The spaghetti sauce tasted like it came from a jar.  Ragu?  Prego?  Chef Boyardi?  Take your pick.  There was absolutely NOTHING fresh in the sauce.  NOTHING.  Processed red stuff all the way.  The only good thing that we had was the loaf of bread that came with the meal.  This place makes the Olive Garden look like the French Laundry.  Save your money.  Please change the recipes.  Thank you.",

    "text": "I came here around 12pm for lunch on a Friday.  It was empty, so the seating was quick.  Our server was very friendly and very efficient, though that could be because of the empty house as well.  More people came soon after we did, though, and the service remained awesome.  Drinks were replenished promptly, many table visits were made to make sure everything was okay (but not too many that it was annoying), and he even gave us more butter for our bread on time. The bread that came to us was crispy on the outside, tough to get the provided knife through at first...but it came to us fresh and warm, and the inside was soft.  The butter was also soft enough to spread, so that was great.   Each entree comes with a soup or salad and spumoni or vanilla ice cream.  I ordered the clam chowder with my jumbo crab stuffed ravioli, and the chowder was excellent.  It was thick, creamy and delicious.   The crab stuffed ravioli, however, is the very reason I took two stars off this potential 5 star review.  The 6 huge ravioli came out covered with a green pesto sauce, and at first glance, looked delicious.  Upon biting into one of the ravioli, I found the pasta too thick and under cooked.  I peeled the corners apart to find a VERY gooey center.  I'm not one to make complaints at restaurants, but I wish I would've here.  I choked down 4 of the raviolis before giving up and asking for my ice cream. I got delicious, seemingly homemade vanilla ice cream, and that was probably the best part.  I could barely finish it due to the 4 uncooked raviolis filling me up at the time, but it was good ice cream. The decor was nice, very rustic and old-town  themed.  My booth was in a replica of a trolley car. All in all, it was a good starter and finisher, but the star of the show was ruined, therefore 3 stars.",

Food was great - I had the Mizithra Cheese pasta, husband got the Meatloaf. The creamy pesto dressing is absolutely amazing - get a side of it to dip your bread in!  We went back in for our 2nd try and it was also great. The only bad thing is, I had bought a $25 gift card previously, and you get a free $5 coupon. I gave the server both the gift card and the coupon, and he deducted the full amount from the gift card, and we lost our free $5. I didn't notice until I got home unfortunately. So - just make sure your receipt is correct!",

The food was absolutely delicious.  While greatly enjoyed everything we ordered, my favorite was the garlic cheese bread.  I have ordered cheese bread from other restaurants and found it to be too dry/crunchy, with either too much or too little cheese.  At the Old Spaghetti Factory the garlic cheese bread was fresh, fluffy, and had just the right amount of cheese and garlic.  The mizithra spaghetti was fabulous, too!  In addition to delectable food, the service was great.  Our waitress was nice and attentive but not overbearing.",

We ordered baked ravioli as an appetizer which was the highlight of the meal.   Salads were disappointing. My wife ordered the house salad and commented that the dressing was a little watery. My caeser was over dressed and came garnished with tomatoes. I felt we both got the cheap end of the lettuce as well.   Entrees were also disappointing as the ratio of sauce to pasta was either too much or too little and both poorly seasoned. The Italian sausage tasted like a breakfast sausage as well. Good news is that my diet coke was good and my wife enjoyed her Italian soda.",

Finally got their attention (this was post-dinner rush, not busy at all) and they looked around like they were trying to find a table for us...  There were empty tables everywhere.  She apparently settled on the one that was currently being bussed, and said \"It'll be just another minute.\"  Yeahokay.    Waitress (Alexis) was slow to greet us, and fairly inattentive for the duration of our visit.  She was friendly enough, just lacking in the service arena.  Some of her mannerisms got under my skin, but no biggie.    The table bread came out REALLY hard - painful on the mouth to eat it (just short of a huge crouton loaf).  The salad (if you could call it that) was absolutely disgusting...  Nothing green about it.  All the white and yellow parts...  Did all of the \"good\" stuff get used up during dinner rush??  And get this, this place is billed as an \"Italian\" restaurant, yet they do not offer Italian dressing.  Yeahokay again.  The entrees - just meh.  Browned butter is usually *browned*; this was just melted butter and mizithra.  Quite unfortunate.    It's sad that OSF has gone downhill to this point; it used to be a good and unique place to hang out and have a drink or two and enjoy a tasty meal; now it's bland with lackluster service from door to table.",

Every meal comes with bread for the table, soup or salad, and ice cream and despite sounding like a ton of food the portions were good.   I left feeling satisfied and not like a stuffed pig. I got the spaghetti and rich meat sauce, my husband got the meat trio, my Tia the plain sauce, and my dad a Caesar salad and everyone loved their food.   The service was amazing one of the best waiters I've had in a while. He was super attentive but not annoyingly so.  The atmosphere seemed a little dated... kinda kitschy but it added to its charm. It was not particularly busy but we we're their 2pm on Father's Day.  Overall a great experience and I would definitely try it again. I'm a fan. :)",

On this visit, the salad and blue cheese dressing hit the spot paired with the warm loaf of bread and honey butter. The mitzira (can't spell that word) cheese and spaghetti is the ultimate comfort food. I don't mix the dish up, but others do pour the butter on top of the pasta. I prefer to save a piece of bread for the end and mop up some cheese and butter. If you order anything else here, it is hit an likely miss.",

I called The Old Spaghetti Factory to cancel the order, and thankfully they did. I put in my order a second time with the code, and The Old Spaghetti Factory cancelled my order even though I did not contact them. I was understanding, however, that they may have interpreted my second order as fraud or a mistake. So I placed a third order with the code applied. When my food was finally delivered, the order was correct, but it did not come with a salad. I excused that because I did not want a salad anyway.",

The worst experience we had was last December with our 3 hungry kids, it took 45 minutes for them to take our order. When they finally came by to take our order, we were told that they had an event scheduled that night, and they had to prepare the group's food before ours. When I asked what the estimated time would be to get our food, he said it would probably be another hour and a half!! I was furious! Especially since we had ALREADY been there for almost an hour! Of course we left immediately. I will never go back to the Old Spaghetti Factory again.",

My go-to-meal is the managers special which is a choice of 2 types of sauces. I like the mizithra cheese in browned butter and meat sauces. This is not healthy of course but oh so delicious mixed together. Each meal comes with a salad and I always choose the creamy pesto. Additional accompaniments are fresh sourdough bread loaves with garlic butter and ice cream at the end. Who can resist spumoni?  My sister is a fan of the italian sodas with the take home glass (the nostalgia part).  Service is usually very quick and is a much more enjoyable experience than dining at Olive Garden. Even the take out service or dining at the bar as a single is enjoyable.",

We had Lasagna, poor or lack of flavor and Chicken Alfredo almost tasteless and the chicken was grisly. I did well to have eaten a third of it because I was extremely hungry!

Start with the food and the prices.  Prices are comparable to places like Olive Garden and other so called Italian restaurants.  The food on the other hand?  We decided to order garlic cheese bread and calamari.  The bread seemed more soggy than crispy and no taste.  He calamari was cooked well but noticed they were all the same size and shape.  Like the ones I buy at Costco.  The entrees came with salads that were covered with watery dressing.  My daughter and I decide to share the Spinach Tortellini with cream sauce that they tried to pass as Alfredo.  No taste and again, seemed like something I purchased from a big box store.  My son got the Chicken Parmigiana with Spaghetti.  He didn't finish anything which never happens.  He was hungry so he ate but he didn't enjoy it.  My wife got the Chicken Piccata.  Fried chicken with a balsamic like sauce, tomatoes, and capers.  It also came with some weird pasta on the side.  She said she like it but when I tasted it, the chicken tasted like it was cooked a little too long in old oil.  Too top it off, service was bad.  We asked for 5 mins to look over the menu but ordered our drinks.  We didn't see her for 15 mins.  We decide to order and this time it wasn't too bad.  Restaurant was not busy by the way.  During the meal, we drink our beverages but no one comes for a refill.  We finally see her again when we complete our meals.  She asks if we want our ice cream as it comes with the meal.  She brings us the ice cream, but no spoons.  Yup, ice cream with nothing to eat it with.  Of course we stop another passing waitress after waiting 5 mins.  My daughter and I just started licking our cups.    Bill finally comes and we give her the credit card.  I kid you not but we sit there another 10 minutes until she comes back.  Grrrr.  Never again.",

When the salad came out I noticed a few leaves of lettuce that looked old. Upon looking closer it was almost rotten. So I decided to sort through the salad, mind you I ordered the dressing on the side as I always do and I found at least 20 different pieces of lettuce that looked old and rotten. Please see the attached photos. So naturally I did not eat the lettuce. When the waiter came to check on us I brought it to his attention he said that the guy in the back that makes the salads should be doing a better job. I couldn't help but think to myself that the server should be looking at it as well but he pawned it off on another associate. Other than that the server was good he was attentive and I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon. My wife ordered shrimp fettuccine Alfredo and she said it didn't taste good.",

How difficult is it to cook pasta , it was way undercooked, the dinner salad that came was limp & warm.   A child's meal of angel hair pasta cooked with butter only for an 11year old was just as bad swimming g in liquid butter goo.   The pictures of this restaurants food on yelp is not from customers. It's staged food from the restaurant.   I will never be going back.",

All I could hear during my entire dinner was a guy on a loud speaker telling everyone to get up and clap and cheer. I couldn't even hear what the person next to me was saying because it was so loud. We discussed it with our waiter and they agreed with us that it was too loud but nothing happened. Guy on the loudspeaker kept on going. A suggestion, do that crap on a Monday when you don't have a restaurant packed full of people. Or another thought, put up a flipping WALL. This was ridiculous! Not really what I had planned for our Friday night out. Couldn't even enjoy our meal.   Now onto good things. Our waiter was AMAZING! (Would have got a 5) Our glasses never went empty and they were always on top of everything. We didn't need to ask. The food was great and we left full.   Giving a 1 star due to the loud guy in the next room.",

It is really clean looking. I see no problem with the layout or decor. The one thing that always gets to me here is the smell. There is the strangest smell in this place, and I smell it every time I come here. It is quite a turnoff I must say. The staff is great even the hostesses. They have indoor and Patio seating which you can take advantage of for just a small window here in AZ. The food is decent. You get a lot of food for the price. The people that complain about the food should remember that it is a very reasonable place in price, it is clean and good service. You really cannot beat it and if you have children, it is a screaming deal still. Lots of parking in the huge lot surrounding the mall.",

While I don't want to be 18 again, I do envy  that flawless and unblemished skin.    OSF accomodates quite a few large parties.  Our table, a very snug  seating for 25, backed up against the wall.  It made it hard to visit one another.   Once we were seated, it took awhile (an hour) for the bread and butter to come to our table.   We asked for it a few times, but it got lost somewhere in the kitchen.  My cutie pie was so hungry, he was crying.  My friend had to flag someone to get my boy some bread!  Then out came a single bread.   My cutie pie wasn't the only one starving as all eyes followed the fresh hot sourdough bread laid in front of him.  It should have been the cue to bring out all the bread at the same time instead of just the one we asked for.     The food.  I looked over the menu...twice...three times.  I decided on the Baked Chicken and minestrone soup.  The chicken was a little bland.  At least I expected the soup to be on the salty side, and it was.   While I love to cook my own pasta at home, I'm not a fan of ordering it.   I settled for chianti to go with my meal.  My hubby ordered the Lasagna Vegetariano.  The pasta was overcooked then drenched with a watery marinara sauce.  My cutie pie liked the  Fetuccine Alfredo.  It was pretty good for a kid's meal.  Not a bad place as long as you enjoy good company, but overall experience was just A-OK.",

    "text": "We were a large group, back in a section that only had large groups.  The poor waitress was expected to handled 2-3 large groups at a time by herself.  We were told only groups of 25 were assigned 2 waitstaff.  What?    OK, so it was busy because of Mother's Day.  We had a reservation but it took them an additional 20 minutes to seat us past our reservation time.  Our poor waitress came around and got everyone's drink orders.  Then she disappeared.  She reappeard with food for another large group, then reappeard with our drinks.  She took the order at that time and disappeared again.  My drink ran dry.  After 15 minutes she came back and gave us our salads and my soup.  Then she disappeared again.  When we had ordered, my husband and I had ordered the two person special.  The appetizer we ordered didn't come with our salads.  The waitress disappeard for another 10-15 minutes and there was no check backs.  I was still dry.  She came back with our entrees and she did have another waitstaff that helped her dish out the plates.  My daughter-in-law's meal was cold and congealed.  I caught the waitress when she finally came back with a drink and they took her plate away to get her another.  The meal was also supposed to come with wine, but she didn't bring it.  When we asked her about it, she assumed she told us that we didn't want it because we'd ordered tea and diet coke.  Not True, and we were not given a choice.    We all finished our entrees, never received our appetizer, and they came and took away our plates and gave us to go boxes.  We pointed out my DIL didn't have her meal and they said they were packing it to do.  What?  After we'd all finished and were paying, our appetizer came out.  While we were paying I asked if we were getting our ice cream and one assistant manager who was doing the checks acted surprised and said \"Did you want that?\" and my answer was \"Yes, it's part of our dinner!\" and he looked very surprised but took our order.  He was right back with it, without spoons.  After we pointed out we couldn't eat it unless we used our knives (which one cousin was doing), he came back with spoons.  My daughter got a dirty one.  The total time we spent waiting for our poor waitress to reappear added up to around 60 minutes - and HOUR of waiting for help, waiting for a check back, waiting for drink refills, waiting for salads, meals, checks, ice cream... etc.  VERY WRONG  After all was said and done, I complained to the manager who stopped by.  It was patently unfair to the waitress to not give her help.  I told the manager that the blame was all on her and other management staff for not helping.  When someone is that backed up, by your own policies, it is the responsibility of the manager to step in and help.  And the managers didn't do that.  It turns out they had multiple managers on duty and NONE of them stepped in to help.",

This is our third visit to the Chandler restaurant, which I guess says it can't be all that bad. My husband wasn't feeling well, so we opted to take out instead of eating there. The waitress was very accommodating, and made sure everything was done to our specifications - all sauces and dressings on the side, no ice in the drinks, both regular and garlic butter, and extra dressings. She even went over everything with me before I walked out the door.  When I got home and started unpacking the meals, I only needed to reheat the meals. Aside from the pasta sticking, which is to be expected without the sauce, everything was perfect. We had a good meal at home without any of the work.  We ordered spaghetti, ravioli, meatballs, sausage, and the olive  tapenade. Everything tasted fresh, but I didn't care for the meatballs... they tasted \"dark\" if that makes sense. The bread was chewy and soft and warm, the way it should be.  We will definitely be returning, but our first choice will be the Phoenix restaurant.",

    "text": "This was probably one of the weirdest restaurant experiences I've ever had. We called ahead for a reservation but were told we could be put on a phone list that will speed up the wait for a table. We opted for that option since we were on our way. When we arrived we were told it'd just be a couple minutes then shortly after we were directed to the bar to find our own table.   Our server did his job of taking our order and delivering the food but there was something about him that was weird. On the menu it says every entree includes bread, salad and ice cream. We ordered the garlic cheese bread but didn't receive the other bread, which would be fine if that's standard or if they gave a price break on the cheese bread or something, but the table next to us with the same server received both items with their order. We got our food which ok... I had the veggie lasagna and my boyfriend had the chicken penne. My lasagna was decent but wasn't any better than a $2 lasagna lean cuisine. The chicken penne was crap. The sauce was like watered down paste. After dinner they server asked if we wanted dessert but we had to mention the ice cream that's included.  Now while all this was going on, on the patio there was a woman on the ground who was being attended to by other customers, not the staff. While the woman was laying on the ground, a server actually stepped over her. It was so weird. They brought out her food and just piled it on the table while she's laying on the ground.  All in all, I would not recommend this restaurant. I felt really weird the entire time I was there. If you are looking for Italian, just go to Oregano's. It is so so so much better!",

The mizithra tasted like just parmesan and butter. When telling the manager he kept rebuttling our claims and saying that I was wrong about the cheese and that he likes the meat sauce and disagrees with my husband. I decided on no more food and my husband changed to chicken parmesan, his favorite. Instead of the two for $25 deal, we now have to pay for every drink, the appetizer, and his parm. They also took 5-10 minutes just to get a drink refill out and didn't clear our dishes right away.  Incredibly disappointed in how this was handled and don't plan to come back any time soon. Maybe we will try the Phoenix location next time.",

I ordered the spinach and cheese ravioli with marinara sauce. The ravioli was alright but nothing super awesome. The marinara sauce was actually very tasty and zesty, which I like. My husband ordered the Italian sausage with spaghetti. He really liked but it only came with 1 medium sized sausage link. His meal came with a bowl of Minestrone soup which was delicious and hearty.

We pointed out the issue with the lasagna, and my wife just asked them to return it (she was no longer hungry).  They didn't take the lasagna off our bill until I dug in and asked to speak with the manager.  I still cringe and have phantom smells of our waitress every time I walk by that place.  It was the single-worst, dining-out experience in my life.",

    "text": "Ah, pasta. One of man kinda greatest food achievements. A food so simply delicious and I believe that this restaurant has some potential. I really wanted to give a 3 star review because my main entree wasn't that memorable but everything else was fantastic so I'm being generous and rounding up to 4 stars for this review.  We went on a quiet Monday evening for my step-sisters birthday. The decor was fancy and everything seemed well organized. My first thought was the price of such elegance! Well I was proven wrong because most items were fairly cheap, 9-14 dollars roughly and it was included in their famous 3 course meal. Browsing the cocktail list made me want to try one but I was with my family who frowns upon alcohol so must try one next time I'm there with friends.   I had the soup to start and it was hot and delicious. I dipped my bread into the soup and I wanted to get fat just off that! I knew my main entree was coming so had to save room for the good stuff. I ordered a Spaghetti Vesvious? Forgive me I can't remember the correct spelling. It had meatball, chicken and sausage with my choice of angel hair pasta and sauce. The pasta noodles were great but I wasn't stricken by the sauce. Their recipe wasn't to my liking, I would have preferred something else. It wasn't great but wasn't bad so I finished the entire plate. I figure a spaghetti factory would specialize in amazing sauce but I've had better from Oregano's, Olive Garden, etc. The dish seemed to brag about a variety of flavors but I only tasted one, tomato. It was supposed to be spicy I'm guessing because it said made with Tabasco and peppers. Not spicy whatsoever which is why I ordered it. There were so many other things on the menu I wanted to try that sounded so tasty and I probably will not order that dish again but I really want to try the spinach and cheese ravioli! They brought out a scoop of vanilla ice cream which finished the meal perfectly. The waiter was nice but I got the vibe he wanted to be somewhere else. He was attentive but every time I said thank you he wouldn't even acknowledge it. Maybe a bit more personality would help but the service was fine. They sang a personalized happy birthday and I felt bad cause I had already hear them sing about 3 other times. Would love to go back and prove they have that potential and deserve more than 3 stars!",

Not sure how its made but tasted like it came out bag with processed or powered mix.  Sent it back got my fav meatballs. That tasted great. But as soon as I walked in the door I had upset belly and ran for the bathroom.  Who knows what causes that but it seemed like strange occurance so soon after the meal. Draw you own conclusions",

(3.5 ) Because they were MIA for a while   Food: delicious  spinach and cheese ravioli is excellent for vegetarians, house salad had plenty of dressing which I loved, but the bread is rock hard at this place. I know it's supposed to be soft because it is very fresh at the one by my house  (4 ) would have thought a 5 if the bread wasn't stale.  Ambience: huge fan of their darker lighting here. Clean, comfortable table and seats, rich mahogany and dark colored flooring makes one feel like a noble in renaissance times. There was a strange sink where the faucet is too close to the edge that one cannot put their hands under it without touching the edge. Ew. Also one soap dispenser was missing the soap. There was also a fruit fly at our table. Ew. (3.5 )  Price: affordable",

We had simple lunch fair, soup and salad, panini, etc. and all of it was blah, the only decent item was the minestrone soup. The side salads were a joke. I mean even Wendy's serves more on their $2 side salads than this place! I do not exaggerate when I say it was simply iceberg lettuce mix with some croutons and dressing. Every salad had the dressing on top, when we all asked for it on the side, which I feel like is pretty standard at all restaurants now, but maybe that's just me.   The draft beer I ordered was completely flat and instead of bothering my waiter I figured I'd just go check out the bar and select a new beer. Except I couldn't do that bc there was literally no bartender in sight. I had to track down and ask the hostess for someone to take my flat beer and just bring me a bottle! I mean for heavens sake!   I could continue on with every little thing that made this experience disappointing, but I think I've made my point. How this place stays open, I have no idea.",

The private party on the other side has a PA system as part of their event.  It was loud most of the time. We had trouble having a conversation during our dinner. The server was told, he knew.  The manager would rather allow the that larger private party disturb us.    I was not the host, but one server for 15 was slow to get drinks.  Slow to take food order.  Everything takes twice as long.  Then he gets a 6 top, so he is gone.  The others servers bring food and auction it off to who raises their hand.    Wish they would train the servers to keep food in order and place it to the seat numbers.  Two servers for parties of 9 or more make for excellent service.  A party of 18 prom girls arrive and our server is there.  We grab who ever we can for coffee, water, clear out table.  In short, salad was basic, chicken moist and hot, host brought cake and no spumoni was served?  Service was average and noise level unacceptable.  OSF is celebrating 30 years, I do not believe that tonight is how the founders want it.",

The menu is pretty diverse, but it does mostly only have large portions that also come with bread, soup or salad and a dessert. Go hungry or be prepared to take food home with you. The prices were pretty reasonable and the service was decent. It could have been a bit quicker, but it was also pretty decent so we understood why it took a while.

We had a large party, half our group were really late, as a server, *I* was upset but our server was super patient and polite!    We finally get our act together, order our food and enjoy the rest of our visit in this restaurant.  Everything was fantastic.

My dad had called earlier in the day for birthday dinner reservations for 6:30 and was told he didn't need them because \"Monday's are really slow.\" We get there at 6:20, didn't get seated until 7:10 with a party of six and a child. Once we were seated, we didn't see anyone for at least ten minutes for drinks and food orders, took forever for drinks to come out which was 4 beers and two soft drinks. We did not get our food until well past 8pm, and it was only 6 out of 7 meals, being told the last meal would be another 6 minutes. The food that was sent out to us was barely warm. We finally grabbed a manager, who half-ass talked to us and then proceeded to CLEARLY talk poorly about our table to other staff members, the typical talk and point type thing, and by this point it was almost 9pm.   There were other tables around us who were clearly having the same experience as us and looked just as unhappy. The manager was pathetic and so rude, this visit 100% ruined this restaurant for us and we will absolutely not be back.",

The location is nice, servers and bartenders were friendly. I will definitely be back to try this place on my next trip to Phoenix.",

    "text": "Service was good food is terrible.  Ordered  Alfredo comes with salad and bread and spaghetti with meat balls.  Bread is hard butter is flavorless. Salad was a joke told me it was mixed green this crap was bagged iceberg lettuce BLAND with the cheapest tiny croutons you could imagine. Pasta was served with way too much parmesan cheese I did mention I didn't like the sharpness or parm cheese they probably served it that way to make up For the milky sauce they called Alfredo. There was no flavor in the food it was very unseasoned. Meat balls were bland and taste boiled had that water taste to it sauce was nothing special more like a watery tomato paste. Not worth it at all and We were very hungry so I am very disappointed in the quality of food. At the bare minimum when you say the salad is a mixed green salad I expect mixed greens not iceberg that came from the cheapest bag you can buy. Not impressed, not satisfied. Don't eat there. Such a shame because the restaurant itself is gorgeous and the staff is extremely nice and welcoming. They should call Gordon Ramsey they need him!",

The last few times I tried to order chicken with my pasta I received fried pieces and then when I was brought back chicken that was not fried however, it was covered in oil and spices that did not complement the garlic mizithra. I am not sure what changed that fried chicken or chicken drenched in oil/spice is what was delivered (when I always order the same way). Needless to say I do not order with chicken any more and look for my protein elsewhere.",

My most recent experience was this past weekend when my husband I visited. We were seated next to the bar and our waiter, Iraq, greeted us right away. His level of customer service was impeccable. He was attentive and asked questions that I really appreciated.  I ordered the Spinach and Cheese Raviolis and my husband ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad - Entree Portion. Each of our plates cost us $11.00 and they came with Iced Tea, Sourdough bread, Minestrone Soup and an order of ice cream. The food is satisfying and the service was wonderful. We will definitely continue to visit this location.",

There are multiple 4 person \"tables\" that have oversized wing chairs that could totally pull off a Shelock Holmes costumed foursome and down the middle, multiple tables inside an NYC Tolley. Super fun if you have kids.   It's a family friendly restaurant and our server was great - a wee bit overloaded and stressed but it was clear she was working as hard as possible. She forgot our fried zucchini and just about passed out in horror- but it was fine because our food came quickly.   It was all very tasty and each entree came with a salad and a small scoop of ice cream - which was a nice touch. Our family of four- with an appetizer, kids meal, and drinks came to a grand total of $31 (tax included) and we got some leftovers to take home.   The ice cream (strawberry, pistachio, chocolate) was soooooo good. I only wish my serving had more chocolate. Yum!!",

My child got a larger portion of her tortellini than I did of my spinach ravioli.    Still, the service was friendly.  As a bonus, we all got to choose from a scoop of vanilla or spumoni (cherry popsicle also available upon request) for dessert.  Go for the spumoni.  It will be the best part of your meal!  Additionally, sitting on the large, misted patio on a perfect night like last night was very relaxing.  Come here after a movie at Harkins with a large group.  Don't expect to be getting the best food.  I mean, I have had better ravioli come out of the freezer section at Fry's.  Still, if you're hungry and you're close... it's better than some of the other mall choices.",

They had good deals going on pretty much 50% off of a few dishes So I had \"Half Spaghetti With White Clam Sauce & Half Meat Sauce With A Meatball\" The pasta was $3.95 the Meatball was $3.75 they say they give you two but its really only one that they cut in half. So to be honest even at Half price for the Pasta I felt like I paid to much Pasta was under cooked no flavor in the Meat Sauce the Clam Sauce was the worst I had took one bite sent it back. I understand it was their Anniversary and they had half of food so they didn't put there all into it but it wasn't busy at all so the the food should have not been under cooked. You would think knowing that people are gonna come you would want to entice them to come back. It was my first and last time going here sad to say.",

However, when I first arrived, my husband was parking the car so they escorted me to the picture area.  The woman that was taking pictures (no name tag) said as soon as she saw me said that we would wait for my \"party\" which I expected anyway. I was very surprised at her abrupt behavior though especially compared to everyone else.  While waiting for my husband (so neither of us were doing anything) I told her that I really loved her accent, and I tried to guess where she was from, she was silent for a second and then rudely said \"its none of your concern\"   Wow, ok, I was quiet after that while we waited. The picture came out great, but I refused to buy them from her after she was rude.   The show was good and the rest of the staff was very friendly. I would go back, just wouldn't get my picture taken.  A side note, we drove around literally for 30 minutes while looking for this place.. We only had our tickets with us which had the address, but didn't have the building it was inside of.  We passed \"old spaghetti factory\" several times.  Finally found it but we were late.",

Haha I know sounds wierd, I am basically saying don't expect too high, and you will be fine. But as a family eatery with prices to not hurt the wallet while you drag kids and grandparents out, OSF really is decent.  I have neither kids nor grandparents, but I managed to see it and enjoy it, for what it is.  Maybe its because I always get the same thing, the manager's favorite, with Mizithra cheese and clam sauce.  Then I mix it all together and I am a happy happy person.  I cannot get this anywhere else.  Now I am not saying you go and try this, I only know a handful of people that like it the way I do, but I will repeat, OSF is the only place I can get it at.  So from 3 stars I give it 4.  Now the bread usually is good, but this location can get inconsistent.  The salad is just busy work till you get your food.  Nothing to talk about there. I have tasted food from others' plate, like lasagna and parmigiana chicken.  They were alright.  Sometimes tasty, other times just blah. The little dish of ice cream you get at the end is perfect.   I really can understand the lower ratings on this place, its not really consistent.  But I do like it and enjoy my dish.  I have gotten lucky with service, no complaints there.  Overall a 3.5 place, rounded up to 4.",

But that wasn't quite the point, every server maybe had 2 tables it wasn't busy at all! We got seated and then began to look around at other tables and they didn't have drinks or food. About 15-20 went by and our server came by I ordered a coffee and water- he stated no coffee was made and it would be 15 more minutes. At this point I'm already irritated and ready to go, we place our order for food soup, salad & entree. No bread or soup was brought to the table before and my coffee didn't event make it to me. At this point I'm starving an we decide to walk to the front and tell the host we decided on something different! Needless to say the reviews and the restaurant style have so much potential, the service needs quite a bit of work! Hopefully I can try it someday with faster service!",

This is not pasta just thrown together in a plate for kids to be occupied and get basic nutrition.  This place is really good.  I actually think that for a spaghetti chain, they make a difference by taking extra care to present the dishes in a pleasant way and by selecting quality contents.  I am a fan of the themed space.  I sat in a trolley car and felt like a kid. To tell you what to specifically order is hard.  I had the option to make my own dish so, I can say that my meaty sauce selection was married with a penne and garlic.  You wanna talk about something good!

The staff was very friendly, don't get me wrong, it was the food and food alone that makes me give this place such a low rating.  I ordered the Chicken Parmesan with a side salad.  The salad tasted like it came out of a plastic bag 2 minutes ago and was covered in Wishbone salad dressing (and I am sorry, that is a slam to Wishbone, that would have tasted better).  No freshly made salads or dressings in house I can guarantee you that.  The sourdough bread was definitely from a frozen loaf, it had this weird color/texture.  But, of all the food I had, this tasted the best (which isn't saying much).  The chicken parmesan was cooked fine, chicken moist, but it had the weirdest breading on it.  Totally tasted (again) that it came from frozen.  My family eats very natural, no preservatives and I could literally taste the MSG, HFCS, trans fat that these food items had in them (which is probably why I only ate half my meal bc I was starving).    My husband had the spaghetti with meat sauce.  Again, bland, tasted canned/frozen.  In conclusion, if you want fast, cheap, highly processed \"Italian\" food, this is your place.  If you want Italian food that is freshly made and prepped onsite, run, run as fast as you can from OSF.....",

So, we ordered the Shrimp Capellini and the Lasagna and Spaghetti. We both loved the Shrimp Capellini, but the red sauce on the Spaghetti was not very good.  Bland. The bread was fresh and hot. The salad was good except it had too much dressing. Next time we go we will ask for it on the side. We both had the strawberry peach Marg which was very good.  Next visit, we will not be ordering the red sauce again. We were so full we didn't get to the desert. But all in all we would go again, it was affordable.",

For an appetizer I had cheese ravioli, most of them were pretty burnt. I had a basic salad come with my entree too. All the lettuce seemed like it was a few days old and yeah that was it, just wilted romaine lettuce and a couple croutons in ranch. Although their free sourdough bread was warm and tasted fine.

    "text": "My first time here and we had a great time!  I am actually surprised by the poor reviews by a lot of ppl, I paid attention most of them because one visit and about specific waiters.  I think when you review a restaurant give them a poor rating just because you run into a bad waiter one time is a little bit funny.  We really enjoyed our food, we got the bread with cheese & marinara sauce and spaghetti with a meat sauce and they both were really good and above expectations.  The waitress was new and wasn't very knowledgeable, but she really tried and was very very nice.  And wow the price?? Everything for $24 plus tip??? It's unbeatable!!  I think all this people who rate a restaurant need to pay attention to how much they paying too!  To go to a restaurant who charges you $30 for two people and compares it to one who charges $100 and rate it as you paid the same is not right.  I really felt like the price & quality is above my expectations and by far!",

We went a little wild this time and ordered the toasted raviolis. Loved em.  Today's tip: Don't order the HEARTY MEAL larger serving if splitting between two hungry adults.

My only complaint  (and it's a big one) was the food.   The price you pay for the quality doesn't match. We started with the garlic fries which were literally frozen fries heated up with minced garlic dumped on top. You get a \"free\" soup or salad with each entree and we chose the soup which reminded us of cambells canned soup. I had the ravioli and it also tasted frozen. You also get a \"free\" scoop of ice cream which doesn't taste all that great either. I  say \"free\" because you're essentially paying for them with the cost of the entree.    If you want a nice atmosphere but below mediocre food this would be a good place to stop.",

The eating area was very clean, although the men's restroom needed a bit of cleaning. It also has a very nice atmosphere.  The food was mediocre. We had the cheesey garlic bread for starters. It was ok. I ordered the Sicilian Meatballs with pasta and a side salad. The salad was one of the worst I have ever had. It looked old and was not green at all; the lettuce was white! On top of all that was way too much dressing. The Sicilian meatballs, pasta, and sauce were average, which is disappointing for a place called The Old Spaghetti Factory.  The service was great and our large group was taken care of well. This Yelper won't be returning anytime soon.",

    "text": "Attention, all servers everywhere: if you get a family with little or semi-little kids, just assume they will spill something and bring extra napkins as your usual procedure. Esp if u want a good tip.  This location is at Chandler mall, right outside the food court/behind Harkins/across from California Pizza Kitchen. Parking is almost always a problem because of all the food places and also Macy's.  Don't bother to make reservations.  When you arrive on time, everyone who did not make any will get to go ahead of you!   Bread they give is sourdough and it is very sour and tough as nails. The best part is if the butter comes out soft instead of hard...easier to spread but for sone reason, they like to bring it out cold and so it usually ends up being unspreadable.  Tortellini is really good. Salad that you get with the tortellini? Mostly iceberg lettuce :/  Kids meals are pretty good and we love the triangular crayons.   A few of the servers are quite good. Many have forgotten silverware, left us hangin for refills, etc. Dessert included with all meals is ice cream...either vanilla or spumoni. Most will not tell you or offer chocolate sauce on that in case you dont care for spumoni or plain vanilla, so keep that secret in your back pocket if you need to.  One time we sat on the patio...waitress turned on a heater overhead for us. At 45 min before closing, the tv went off. We asked the waitress and she was all, \"huh.  Not sure why.\" And never got it back on for us.  This visit, the sun was in our eyes and I asked the server if he could put a shade up and the manager came to move us, so that was cool.  They have Coke products and I believe a full bar since there is a bar section where you can also sit.  There is a train with tables you can sit in...usually those are reserved, but see my comment about reservations above.   Some tables have these high-backed velvety chairs and we feel like the royal family when we get those. :)  They have a loyalty program. Check in on their tablet when you arrive by punching in your cell # and on 5th time you can get a free lunch item or a discount if it is dinnertime.",

We are seated there are two pitchers of water but no glasses. We wait patiently and no one comes over so after 15 min I go to the hostess and ask if a server has been assigned to us. Almost 30 minutes before a server comes over to take our drink order, we ask for glasses for the water. The server says she will bring them over we are now ready to order. She takes the order and forgets to go around the whole table and walks away. Now keep in mind it is now 7:29 pm we have been at our table for 1/2 hour and still no cups for water all though the water is on the table. We chase the server down to tell her she didn't take all the orders, server takes the rest of the orders and walks away, still no glasses for water. I go back to the hostess and ask for a manager, a few minutes later the manager comes to the table as the server is dropping of drinks and the manager asks the server if everything is good. I speak up and say no it's NOT, I begin to tell him that it's unacceptable to be at a restaurant for more than 1/2 hour and not have anyone see if we have been helped or a server come over to take our order. We ask if our food is already made he says no we say cancel the order and give us our bill for the drinks. Manager says let me get you appetizers while you wait for your food. Seriously, you can't get anyone to take our order and you want to make us happy with appetizers \" no thank you\". I proceed to tell him we are leaving and I would like your regional managers number. I am in the industry and have been for over 15 years, you don't treat customers like this ever. It is a competative market and all we had to do was cross the mall and have dinner at Buffalo Wild wings.. to give you an idea how long everything took my husband and daughter were able to meet us for dinner.

I ordered the sparkling basil strawberry lemonade cocktail and idk what makes it sparkling but it didn't taste like a sparkling drink and I had a huge blob of old ass basil in it, I couldn't even taste the basil in it either. Maybe due to the fact it was old af it could no longer produce any sort of flavor. Our waitress was nice but slow and we ordered water with lemon and got water with no lemon which is a baby owie compared to the old lettuce and basil I had to endure. I also ordered the spinach and cheese ravioli with \"homemade marinara\" homemade straight from a can I think, tasted a little sour, which is the only taste I could get from it and the ravioli tasted like something I could get at fry's in the freezer aisle. I'm sure this place would be great if you're drunk or high though so, if you're intoxicated I'd give it a try otherwise I say pass.  Update: I just finished my drink and I can taste the basil. Tastes like old basil that has been sitting in a cooler for weeks",

I will definitely come back as the prices were very fair and the sauces are very good. Not to mention to Brett that they brought out was still steaming and excellent.",

So after the waiter finally came back I asked for some HOT food, that took a while by which time everybody else was finished eating. Second time out they put the WRONG sauce on one side. I ended up telling them not to bother with any food. It was a very quiet time, I'm sad they can't even manage passable food when they are not busy. I won't be repeating this again.",

    "text": "My 2nd oldest turned 21 baby!! She wanted a dinner party with family and friends and she picked the place, after all it was her night her party!  The place picked for the event was The Old Spaghetti Factory.  The Old Spaghetti Factory has been a place my family has enjoyed going to, from my grandparents to my grandkids, we have all had a nice time, the family use to go to the one out by Newport Beach, then when we moved to Phoenix, we went to the downtown location. So it was no surprise she picked this place.  We were a party of 20, when we went to the room were the tables were setup my son in law didn't like the flow of it because it had  1/2 the party on one side and other  1/2 away from them, so we moved some tables around and made a upside down L shapped table, which worked and we all got to interact with everyone.  We got there about 7pm, around 7:25  servers asked for our drink orders, around 7:45 they started asking us for our orders, but none of us had any menus but we were never able to tell anyone we didn't have menus because there was no one around, we ordered our food around 8pm.  By this time most of everyone's drinks needed to refilled, the bread that was out is now gone and there are no servers to be found.  I had to ask for tea 3 times.  The food wasn't mind blowing, it wasn't even that great, I did ignore the reviews other Yelpers wrote because this was what my daughter wanted and I wasn't going to be all Oh other Yelpers said this wasn't that great. No I wanted her to have what she wanted.      I ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce, it was bland, no flavor, but I did eat it, I was starving. By now its after 9pm everyone was done with their meal and ready to get on the 2nd  1/2 of the party, but again no servers and no checks, people starting standing up and then out of magical air our checks showed up, everyone was not happy with the service they got, had to ask many times for refills, cheese, napkins, plates, other random things one asks for.  85% of the party skipped the free ice cream SKIPPED THE FREE ICE CREAM, the kids were the only ones who went for it, everyone else just wanted to leave.  Fortunately even with the bland food & missing servers my daughters night was not ruined.   Oh I also should point out, I told the server that it was my daughter's 21st birthday and I wanted to buy her 1st legal drink and she took the drink order, but NEVER ID my daughter. What if I was lying about her age??   smh",

The staff is incredibly young......college young which did not match the overall theme of the place. For 32.00...we had pasta and sauce, pasta and clam sauce, salad, soup, 2 spumoni ice cream, a coke and a cherry float. Definitely a great deal with hot bread, soup or salad, entree and dessert included in your entree price.  No linguine !!!!! No way !!#!#&* ! My pasta and clam sauce was creamy and very good. Their standard meat sauce is very thick, savory and rich. Very old school.....which might turn off some people. Not light by any stretch. Not our style.  Service at 530 pm was questionable with our soup n salad coming with our entrees. We will go back .......",

    "text": "The banquet service at Spaghetti Factory is less than stellar. There were about 90 people in the room but they only had one waitperson taking drink orders. We had the sangria and it seemed to be made with concentrated fruit punch. When they did pass out the bread, there was one loaf per table of 10 people. At one point the waiter dropped a loaf of bread on someone at our table and still served it to another table! The dressing on the lettuce only salad had a watered down ranch dressing of some sort. The main entrees were ok, but a little small and flavorless. The single scoop of ice cream was forgettable. Getting our check paid took forever and most guests were gone by the time it was completed. If I was basing my opinion of Spaghetti Factory on this single visit, there would not be a reason to ever go back.",

The pasta was over cooked and my salad was cheap iceberg lettuce with Brown rust on it. My friend ordered the spinach & cheese ravioli and the sauce was seasoned with pure sugar. The bread they give you tastes like straight up yeast and is hard as heck. We saw our waiter twice, once to show up after 5 minutes of waiting to  order our food and drinks and another to pay our check. There's zero customer service here. The food is awful and so is the service. People who like this place obviously love bland under seasoned food. I feel like they only get business because they're located at the fashion mall. Please do not waste your money or time here.",

It had chicken breast, fettuccine, broccoli, mushrooms and the sauce was Alfredo sauce. I liked it. The person who was with me ordered some spaghetti with meat sauce. I tasted it and it was not bad.   The best thing, in my opinion, pretty much every meal was a 3 course meal. You start with some warm bread to share (if you're with people) and then either a soup or salad. Then comes your dish. Finally you get either vanilla ice cream or something that is a mixture of pistachio, cherry and chocolate. I chose the latter and it was also good.   The service was pretty good for what it was. Our waiter seemed like he was in a rush, not that he was rushing us though. He just seemed like he was getting overworked or something. Although he was so fast, he was not bad.   Although this place is very good, I won't be a regular. I'd definitely come back though, just not consistently.",

    "text": "One of the words in the name of this place correctly describes it and it isn't \"spaghetti\".  We came here for a wedding reception and were just kind of whelmed with the experience.  First off, lets call a spade a spade. This place is CHEAP. All their meals come with bread and a salad/soup and spumoni ice cream for dessert for under $15. Their current special is a 4 course meal for 2 for $25 so they definitely have a target demographic.   The venue itself was nice and clean but there was a large wait at 7 PM so be early or be prepared to wait.  We had a back room that was very large and could accommodate very large parties. The servers were nice but a bit inexperienced. I ordered a chardonnay, received a pinot nior. We were served by table and both times food was delivered (salad and entree) someone at our table was left out and had to grab a server to get their meal.  We were offered 3 choices of of entrees. Mine was very bland, I had the fettuccine Alfredo which was low on taste and on sauce. The Boy got the Chicken Marsala which was a bit better, the side of Mizithra Spaghetti was to die for but the Marsala sauce tasted pre-made and the chicken portion was small.  This place is good if you are looking to eat on the cheap, if your in-laws are in town, or if you are a High Schooler going to Prom. Spend a little more $$$ and go to Rigatony's instead.",

Years ago, when living in Portland, OR, we ate at the original Old Spaghetti Factory and this certainly brought back nostalgic memories. We had reservations at 5pm and were seated immediately in a very spacious and comfortable booth, across from the signature railroad car. Karen was our server and she was so attentive to every detail. The spaghetti and meatballs was cooked to perfection, with the pasta perfectly al dente. The chicken parmesan was moist and tender. The spumoni ice cream to top off the meal was a welcome treat, but two of us couldn't resist getting the mud pie! MMMM! Certainly worth the caloric splurge!  Anthony, the manager, stopped by our table and was very charismatic and welcoming.  We will definitely be back for more!",
