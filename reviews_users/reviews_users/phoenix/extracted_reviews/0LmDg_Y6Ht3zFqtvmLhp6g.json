I've been here a couple of times now (we usually go to the one in Mesa or Tempe) and both times the service was very slow, didn't really care that we were there ordering a decent amount of food and the food did not come out as hot as it does as other locations. That leads me to believe the server just didn't bring us our food right when it was ready. I had to get up and go find him to ask for a dessert and check.   We probably won't go back to this location because of the current wait staff but will definitely go to the other spots!",

I really wish I would've came with hubby so we could have each selected different ones and split them. I finally decided on the Cottage Pie. Seasoned ground beef with mashed potatoes, peas, and carrots all wrapped up in a buttery crust. The filling was spot on with the ratios. It came with a red wine gravy that was excellent. It was very filling and I can't believe that I was able to eat the entire thing. They had several different side options that you could purchase and many of them sounded good however I chose not to get any because the prices seemed a little high for one person. I really liked how the restaurant has three different levels that you can choose to dine in as well as an outside patio. They had a wide assortment of beers and cocktails but because it was my lunch hour from work I stuck with an iced tea.  Too bad because honestly the iced tea tasted kind of off.",

The restaurant has a fabulous dark wood (but open air in front) ambience and enthusiastic in-character wait staff who seemed to love pasty as much as I do.  It was *so* hard to chose which one to order.  As I was in the Southwest, I opted for the southwestern style Carne Adovada with pork and chili peppers.  Yes, it sounds weird for a Pasty.  My reasoning was that if this was going to be good anywhere, it would be here in Phoenix.  And it was awesome!  Succulent pork, mildly spicy chilli peppers, with a small amount of rice and beans (hard to notice actually).  Really unusual to have a pastry crust over something like a burrito, but it worked.  In speaking with the server, I learned that this restaurant has other locations throughout the country, including one in Boston.  I may have to look into mail ordering from this place...",

    "text": "If you know anything about the history of the cornish pasty, it's that miners used to eat it as meals; there's extra dough on the outside so that the could just eat it with their index finger and thumb - so that their food wouldn't get dirty (even though they themselves might have been dirty from the mines).  I know this because these mines originated in the U.P. (Upper Peninsula in Michigan); and I actually came with two Yoopers - my husband and his good friend. They grew up their entire lives eating pasties. Tough crowd! What's the verdict? These pasties lived up to their expectations! We each got a different one. Mine happened to be Thanksgiving themed; filled with turkey, a wine gravy, stuffing, and cranberry sauce. I couldn't have asked for a tastier pasty. We also ordered a Shepard's Pie themed one, and that  had everything a hearty meal could ask for, lamb, potatoes, veggies. It was delicious!  The only reason I'm knocking a star is that the service was only OK. I waited ten minutes to get a drink, and our appetizer was brought out with our meals, which was definitely unusual. I understand we went during happy hour on a Friday, and they were short staffed, but still.  Overall, I would definitely come back again to get more pasties!",

Call ahead, unless you're on a date ;) The service was great, the food was just as I expected and enjoyed the nice breeze where I sat just in front. It's a very classy place to eat, so stop complaining about some disrespectful prink writing on their bathroom walls, and enjoy the amazing food and view.    Parking was not bad, just had to park in the public lot for $2.00 around the corner.  Sure, it's not parking in front, but you're talking about a prime beautiful location, so pay the $2 for public parking and enjoy yourself.  I'm excited to visit again soon and try other tasty selections.",

I finally decided to pipe up and said to a worker \"excuse me\" and she turned to us with a sigh and eyeroll and said \"ya...\" My fiance said we have been waiting for 15 minutes can we get a menu? Then she proceeded to tell us she was not our server but could get someone to help us. (Mind you she was walking in and out of the restraunt looking like she was bored out of her mind, so who knows what her purpose was there because we were told it was self seating...) After i got the hint she did not want to truly help us or do her job, we decided to go else where. We are generous customers but I will not give our money to servers who don't want to do their job and help their  customers, especially who are newly visiting or especially give our money to people who mock us for leaving.

However, I would NOT return to this location on the basis the service was subpar. We arrived for a friend's birthday party, said our hellos and made our way to the bar to order our drinks. It was 20 minutes before any of the bar staff acknowledged we had arrived to order. We had two people receive drinks before us.  After we finally made our food and drink order we promptly received our drinks that were delicious and mixed well. If you've ever been to a Cornish you know the food takes a bit of time because they make it fresh when you order it which is why I love it here. Unfortunately, with making our drinks the bartender forgot to put in my order into the till. So we saw orders come out of the kitchen but were told no one submitted the order at all. After mentioning that we were not going to take the food after all. The bartender sounded very annoyed at the thought that I declined the food.   I understand it's a busy time of the night and everyone feeling flustered at how busy it is. I've been there, but customer service should never suffer because of it.",

However, this place does a great job at living up too the famous Cornish pasties of old.. New flavours with traditional style = great food! Plenty of beverage options and staff who go the extra distance to make sure everything is perfect.",

    "text": "Well. This has been my worst experience at a Cornish to date. We got here as part of a group event in the upstairs bar and were among the first to arrive. We took our seats at the end of the bar and waited 20 minutes for someone to take our beer order. Another 30 minutes go by, empty glasses, and we are unable to get a drink or a menu. People walk right by us. We finally flag someone down (a really rude blonde woman) and place our order. Another 30 minutes go by and we have no food and more empty beers. Unable to Flag her down again, our food arrives only it is wrong and we still have empty drinks. It takes 10 minutes for us to tell a server our drinks are wrong and another 19 to get mor drinks.  As I write this, we are still awaiting our food and we have been here almost two hours.   Usually I love this place and I come here a lot but this is unacceptable and makes me want to find another place. :/  Aaron, the manager was great. He was very nice and apologetic while we were there and followed up with us via email. I'm hoping to get back in the next week or two to update my review.",

We had a group of five and captain sunshine was our server. He looked miserable, walked away every chance he got and made us feel bad for being there. Even after an attempt to strike up small talk to ease him up a bit he still looked pissed off. He kept saying \"I think we are out of that\" but never checked to confirm or suggest something else in its place. The food was pretty good. The chicken pate was odd and something I wouldn't order again. The rest of it was pretty good. The interior is really cool. I think had we not sat downstairs and had better service we would of enjoyed it more.",

    "text": "I called about 20 different restaurants in Downtown PHX to find a space where I could host my husband's 40th bday dinner and about 30 guests. Most downtown restaurants require a $150-200 fee just to reserve a private or semi-private dining area, and any party larger than 20 people would require a prix fixe menu and/or a a buffet style at a per person cost billed to the hostess. I didn't want to charge my guests, and I couldn't afford to pay for all of them myself. I also didn't want to limit what they could order with a prix fixe menu. When I called Cornish Pasty on Monroe, they happily worked with me and didn't seem phased by this at all. (I even visited the party and called again in advance to make sure there wasn't a catch!) They even allowed my guests to order and pay for  their own food on separate tabs, which I can understand is probably a nightmare scenario for a restaurant. The tables they reserved for us were in a semi-private area up in the second floor loft where all the pool tables and dartboards were. So, it was a lot of fun for our guests. The server was superb - as responsive, quick and accommodating as you could expect for that many people. He even worked to secure us an extra table during dinner rush hour when it became clear that 5 people to a bench was not a realistic estimate. Everyone said their pasties were on-point and a perfect start to my husband's 40th birthday pub crawl downtown. Well done, Cornish Pasty! Thank you!",

I called in to place my order for pickup \" Can I get XXXX. No we are out of that. Ok what about XXXX. No we don't have those either... what about XXXX. Ummm let me check, not we don't have those...\" finally after finding a Pasty that they actually have available I am told it will be ready in 15 minutes. I head down to the restaurant and give the server my name. I am told it will be another minute or two. 25 minutes later I ask how much longer it will be. Oh sorry there was a technical difficulties so it will literally only be another minute... 30 minutes later my food comes out. No remedy for the situation and no sorry about your hour lunch that was wasted. To top it off as I'm signing my receipt one of the cooks come up to me and says \"Oh your XXXX\" that's really good timing your food just came out... um no jackass I have been waiting in your restaurant for over an hour now its god awful timing...  Ok so after all of that grief I get back home and open my pasty to find it charred black on the bottom... I give up. Cornish Pasty will not get my business anymore.    ***Update, the Owner has reached out to me after this incident and is working with me to make amends. I decided to visit again a few days later and i received great timely service, they have a full menu now and food was ready when i got there and was fresh and delicious.Thank you for your effort. ***",

No matter where you sit be it in the dark, speakeasy-esque downstairs or the spacious top level of the building, the service and atmosphere is great.   I always like to highlight Cornish Pasty's vegan and vegetarian pasty menu. It can be tough to find a veggie friendly spot, let alone one that has their own section of the menu, but Cornish always has my back. My absolute favorite is the veggie cottage pie pasty. The flavors are excellent and the texture of the \"ground beef\" really makes the dish. It's a great vegetarian alternative for a classic dish.    Another one of my favorite dishes that I absolutely rave about is the potato and leek soup. TO DIE FOR. It's creamy, rich, and is delicious with bread.   I will continue to be a customer for life and *always* look forward to a meal at Cornish Pasty.",

I sat on the top floor honestly because that's where most of the people we're sitting.   Staff was great, very attentive and friendly.   Food was unique. Basically a delicious meal wrapped up into a pastry.  I ordered the scotch egg (which was good) and the Tikka masala pasty which was great.   One thing that concerned me was that you can't make edits/special requests to the food. That screams frozen premade food to me. BUT my meal came out using delicious and not previously frozen.   Prices are very good. All pastys are around $11 and they have an ok happy hour.   If I had my way with this place, I wish I could get 2 or 3 pastys for the same price. Lots of different options to choose from so I really would have liked to try multiple of them vs the one big one.   I would definitely come back here to try the different pastys as the number of options is great.   Give them a shot!",

    "text": "My only experience with Cornish Pasty Co. stems from dining at their Mesa location last summer. Despite a few service quips, I was pretty impressed. This particular location, situated on Monroe Street, is a bit different in setup, but still excellent in regards to food quality.  First off, be aware that you'll need to seat yourself. Mesa's Cornish location has a hostess. This might result in some confusion. There are three levels, but I've only eaten in the basement by choice. The area is filled with multiple leather/mobster booths and a seedy \"dive\" feel. Ideally, it's where I would hang out if I wanted to hide from the rest of the world and just eat pasties and play board games all night.  It's really hard to recommend pasties here, because everything we've ordered is excellent quality. It really boils down to personal preference. I've never been a big meat/potatoes guy, so I'm more drawn to their Italian-styled pasties, while my girlfriend always defaults to their Pilgrim due to her love of traditional Thanksgiving food. There are no disappointments to be found here, which is the result of ingredients that are solid quality and a shortcrust that packs flavor and fluffy texture.  For dessert, despite the constant Yelp recommendations for the banoffee pie, we struggle at passing up their chocolate bread and butter pudding. The booze inclusion is subtle and satisfying. It's warm interior with a crispy outer-shell just makes it irresistible, but eventually we'll cave and try something else.  Cool environment, great food, and reasonable prices for what you receive. How can you not Cornish give it a strong recommendation?",

Served with side creamy horseradish. My fiance got the Cajun Chicken both very good! And I like the environment and I say up stairs overlooking the kitchen where you can watch them prepare the delicious filled pastries. A must try!  Happy Eats!",

I ordered the chicken pot pie.. it was delish.. that pastry crust is perfect with the veggie, chicken & gravy filing. We shared the garlic roasted potatoes, also very good!

The oven chips were some of the worst fries I've ever had, probably second worst.  They were leathery and very dry, like potato jerky.  I chucked those too.  Very disappointing for such an expensive meal.",

Moving into the food...I had the vegan soup of the day, it was veggie noodle. Nothing special but the bread is always good. We also ordered the vegan vindaloo pasty with curried potatoes and \"chicken\" it was a big spicy for me, but I was able to enjoy a few bites. We ended the night with a really tasty apple pie pasty served with vanilla ice cream. It was really freaking good, went like the snap of a finger.   The service was chill, but attentive. You bet I'll be back at this location!",

The outside was crisp all the way til the last bite. The bar staff was awesome. They delt with me while I weighed my options. I had a peanut butter stout to top it off.

    "text": "Utterly disgusted with the poor service at this place. I honestly would give ZERO stars, if possible. I've been patiently waiting for the opening of this spot downtown and boy was it a big let down.   The decor is amazing. It's sort of a mix of a bar and a church! Three levels of great space. The downer...you'll never get your food.   Got in after the lunch rush, so the restaurant wasn't packed. Ordered our food and was told it would take no more than 15-20 minutes.....drum roll. We waited 55 minutes and got no food! Not a joke at all...I actually would've preferred it be a joke.   I noticed a table behind us get their food and I stopped a server (not my server because he never came back) to see how that could be when they came in about 15-20 min after we did. He went to check and advised our ticket \"got lost\" and that our food would be out in two minutes. Fast forward 12 minutes later, still no food. My original server locked eyes with me and I believe he might've tinkled on himself because he could tell I wasn't a happy camper.   We got up and told him we're leaving. His response...an excuse. He said our order got behind a big ass table upstairs. Those were literally his words. I let him know I don't care what the excuse was, it's unacceptable. All he did was apologize, no attempts to remedy the issue.   I was seriously excited about the opening of this place, but the chances of me visiting again to give them another shot...slim to Hell No! First impressions are lasting, especially when the service is terrible. Customers don't like to hear excuses, they want solutions. Hell, they actually just want their food. That's what they come for in the first place...good eats!  You have a ton of work to do, Cornish Pasty. Good luck.",

I really love what they did with this building with the garage doors and patio seating. It was perfect for the overcast cool day and we came in here to check it out for lunch.  Unfortunately, my time here was marred by the extremely slow service. When coming in for lunch in a place downtown, on a Monday afternoon, the servers should be aware that everyone has to get back to their own jobs within a certain time frame. Pasties that are made ahead with a couple of ice waters should not make for an hour-long visit. We also made the mistake of getting a dessert which just tacked on more time and we had to flag down the server to get it to go after sitting waiting for 15 minutes. I've never had a problem with wait times before so I can't  say if the staff just wasn't on their best game or what, but it was really disappointing. I absolutely love CP Co. but I'll make sure to skip this location unless I have plenty of time to spare.",

I avoided going there for the first few weeks as I heard it was a bit crazy and unorganized. I have been there twice for lunch and once for early dinner/happy hour.  The food is pretty much the same, delicious as always. My favorite is still the veggie chicken tikka pasty. The service is very chill and friendly, just like the other locations.  The atmosphere is very special. It is an old, historic building and has three very cool levels and a nice patio for people watching. The basement is my favorite. It reminds me of a speakeasy.  My only complaint is they do not have a happy hour. We went there thinking there would be and we were disappointed to be informed they don't have one \"yet\". They need to work on their happy hour game! Us downtown workers love to get our drink on and we love our happy hour so hop to it Cornish Pasty Company!",

Ordered the broccoli & cauliflower cheese bake to start which was pretty good, had quite a bit of cheese and veggies...then I ordered the Cajun chicken and my friend got the Italian. The crust was perfect and all of the ingredients worked well together. Overall the service was great and we had a good time, only reason I gave them 4 stars was because our appetizer and the pasties came out at the same time which is always annoying to me.",

The name caught my eye and we decided to give it a try (especially after noticing Guinness on tap). It seems like it would be a small place judging from the outside but there is seating up stairs, down stairs, on the main level, and outside. We found a place right by the doors which turned out to be perfect.  The menu is amazing with so many great options. They even have a couple vegan options and various vegetarian dishes as well. Husband tried the Italian and I tried the Lamb and Mint. They were so good and full of flavor.  I wanted to try the PB&J dessert, but was too full. Next time for sure!",

As for the the food, my wife is very hard to please as she is an executive chef and has been for over 30 years. No complaints from either of us. I have to say I eat pastas every time I'm in Escanaba Michigan during smelt season. My Oggie Original Pasty was as good if not better than what I get up there in Escanaba. My wife had a salad that was 100% fresh lettuce and vegetables. They have an excellent choice of beers on tap and a very friendly atmosphere. I will most definitely be taking my Michigan guests there for dinner when they come to Phoenix for a visit. Once again great job Leah thanks for a memorable lunch.",

Saying she ASSUMED I didn't want them?!.  Im so glad I kept my cool on that chick and she walked away.  I will NEVER step foot in that place again.

The downstairs captures a mellow speakeasy feel. The upstairs has darts, pool tables, and a pew style seating area. The UK style menu has savory pasties (pastry case with beef and veggies) and even some Indian style dishes like chicken vindaloo.

They told us it would be about 15 minutes because they make them fresh and we enjoyed our drinks. Everyone loved theirs. I had the adobo and it was the right blend of cheese and sauce and pork. Came with sour cream and salsa. We got banafee pie for dessert and it has become one of my favorite desserts. Service was good, place was packed, they maybe could have used one more server but someone else came grab our checks so it looked like the manager was helping out to get everyone out in a reasonable amount of time.

The cocktail menu selection was very limited, so again, it was choose from this menu of three things or get a glass of wine. I guess I just expected a wider menu for signature cocktails given it's such a niche restaurant.  On top of that, we had a table that was pretty much no lighting except for the two tea light candles. I couldn't even see what I was eating, so that was a bit of a turn off from coming back.   The food was okay, the music was too loud to have a normal conversation, and there was almost no light to even see what was in my food.

I literally thought they gave us the wrong one because the fake chicken was so convincing! Drinks were really good, rosemarys baby cocktail was the all around favorite but the lavender honey being a close second. Great service from the server who's name I forgot with the long dark hair who makes boom boxes out of old suitcases. Will be returning!",

Watch the homeless population for this location, it can be a bit distracting when trying to enjoy the outdoor seating area.",

    "text": "I'm going to start with a confession: I've been to CPC three times in the last week. So I might be a bit biased...in a good way. Cornish Pasty Company brings the charm of a British pasty shop and placed it in a low key setting (several, actually) in the Valley. What they have created is a family-friendly dive that's great for food and drinks.  As for the location, the Phoenix spot is amazing. You might think of it as one restaurant but it's actually a restaurant and three bars, each with its own character. The basement is a lounge, the ground floor is a pretenseless pub, and the top (where I always end up), is a chill bar. The place keeps their food simple, while offering a vast array. Seriously, there's gotta be about 40 pasties, a third of which are vegetarian (and maybe even vegan). I've tried about six of them over the last few visits (go with friends so you can share) and, while I have favorites of the lot, I haven't had one that disappoints. Speaking of other things that don't disappoint--the beer list. While not as expansive as the pasty list, there's something for everyone. Oh, and the bartenders can mix up great cocktails. Seriously, I love this place--whether it's a stop on a night out or the main event, it doesn't disappoint.",

I got the spicy Asiago chicken Pasty and I also tried the carne adovada Pasty.  I really like the carne adovada Pasty as opposed to the spicy Asiago chicken. The port in the carne adovada was really juicy and flavorful. You get a side of sour cream and salsa, which I just lather onto the Pasty. Would definitely recommend trying the carne. The spicy Asiago chicken was okay, I'm but I'm not too big into the Hatch Chiles, and there was less flavor with the chicken compared to the pork. Wasn't really spicy in my opinion.  Spicy Asiago chicken was around $10.50 + tax*  The carne adovada was $12 plus tax.  Really like the free pool tables that they have upstairs, easy way to pass the time. Also good window seating upstairs.  The Waitresses were super friendly and attentive.   Come check this place out.",

    "text": "I'm a Brit and I took my co workers to this location last week. I love the East Valley Location's and the food at those restaurants is amazing.   This review is only for the Phoenix location as I have previously not had any problems with the Cornish Pasty.   The service was not good, the young girl that served us made it feel like a chore for her to be doing so. My food was great, lamb and mint pasty is my go to!   Everyone else's food was not even okay. One persons food was forgotten, they brought it out later but it was cold in the middle. She begrudgingly took it back, and bought it back to him, practically threw it on the table, still cold! They didn't charge him, but he was turned off by the service and look of his meal, that he left it behind anyway.  I asked for extra gravy as the portions for gravy are way too small. She said, \"well I have to go down stairs to get it\"! Like she was trying to get me to say don't worry about it. . She did come back with it quickly despite \"having to go downstairs\" and once again kinda dumped it on the table, along with salt and pepper that another person requested.  No one got a drink refill automatically. We had to wave her back to us to order our food and to get a drink refill, which was again dropped on the table I thought it would spill over.   Really unimpressed with this girl. Not the one with a bunch of tattoos, but a younger girl.   The Oggie my friend ordered was \"dry and tasteless\" and my other co worker reported his food was warm but not hot. So generally a disappointing experience, especially considering that the other locations in Mesa and Tempe have been completely different experiences for me.   I have been to this phoenix location a few times now and each time received a sub par experience especially with service and quality of the food. I'll avoid this location from now on I think. The East Valley Location's are worth the travel though.",

Besides the lag during the lunch run, the peppered steak pasty with mushrooms and leek, was a bit on the salty side, but very homely to eat.  It was surely a filler and complimenting with a beer, which they have a variety to choose from.   There were other pasties to try as well. Thanksgiving is coming up so I was on the edge to try turkey with stuffing pasty, but was thinking that I will have a feast of that in the coming month!  One staff knew his pasties so he recommended well.  They have 3 tea selections and it was refreshing for the warm day.    It's a spacious pub and sort of looks antique.  It suits the pub pasty experience.  Lots of room for dining!   Comfort spot!",

You can pick between three levels (basement, main floor and loft) and the patio - which is a rare treat in Phoenix. It's the perfect dark, cool spot to beat the summer heat.  They have a vast array of vegetarian pasty options and always have up to four vegan options on hand. I've had the vegan southwestern pasty before and enjoyed it, but had a hard time believing it was vegan! They used a mock chicken - probably Gardein - and vegan cheese. However, the vindaloo is my favorite of the vegan options. The first time I had it, it was almost too spicy for me (which is rare) but my second try had the perfect amount of heat. It was a little heavy on the potatoes, and they could have been cooked more, but it was filling and delicious. The best part is always the crust!   Service is fast and efficient - no issues. And the location is close to everything. So if you need a cool place to eat and drink in downtown Phoenix, don't overlook Cornish Pasty!",

Unfortunately, I'm experimenting with a low-carb diet right now. :(  I ordered the scotch egg to start. It came warm and quartered on a shallow bed of lettuce with a mustard sauce. (Despite years in the U.K., I never learned to appreciate \"brown sauce.\") The reheating (you have to do that) made the edges a little crispy but I didn't mind.  Since the sausage on the scotch egg was tasty, I decided to get the sausage salad (low-carbing, remember?). Unfortunately, they were out of sausage. So, I decided to get the tandoori wings to go.  Tandoori wings: Yum! Full of flavor. Tender. Meat easily separating from the bone.  So, why only 4 stars? The restaurant is too dark. They didn't have what I ordered. My tomatoes (accompaniment for the wings) were slightly white and puffy. (I didn't try them.)",

It was pretty cool getting to watch all the pastries get made. They measure ever ingredient. We split both The Oggie (The Traditional Pasty) $9.75 Steak, potato, onion, and rutabaga (swede) with a side of red wine gravy and Cubano $12.00 House pulled Mojo pork, ham, swiss cheese, dill pickles, and yellow mustard. Served with mustard cream sauce, spicy mustard, or extra yellow mustard. We wanted to try the Oggie because it seemed like the traditional thing. It was good but OH MY... That Cubano was one of the best versions of a Cuban I have ever had and this girl loves her Cubans. That mustard cream sauce paired perfectly with the ham and pickles. The crust was out of this world. I will go back just for another Cubano and this time keep the whole thing to myself. One of my favorite things about this place is the cool vibe too. I believe it is all original furniture, carpeting, some fixtures, booths, and bar's from the original building. I found that very charming! Next time I come I want to check out the basement, I heard it has speakeasy vibes.",

Honestly, I just ordered them yesterday same this order and before in many times except I order just one side order of pastry chip. I know what exactly size is. They always give a big box and full for one side order. (You can see how it differ from yesterday and today from the picture) This time, I order one more side order. It means two of it. I suppose to get two big boxes. When I got it, I saw just one box. Then, I ask Lucy (who took my order) I got only one side. She said they put together. I told her last time I order one side why get the same side with last time. She just brings it back, and separated in two small box, and take some out, too. Really!! You do that!! I've been there many many time, never get bad experience like this before. But this bad experience from Lucy will make me won't go back there anymore.",

The one thing on the menu I could order - the chicken tikka salad - is dry, flavorless and disappointing.  Cool building though! Patio is the hot commodity.",

You go down the stairs to a long narrow room, very dark with booths on one side and tall tables in the middle. There was only one girl handling service so she was swamped. We ordered two of the pastries from themenu, and a beer. The beer arrived. It took 30 minutes for the pastries and one of them was not what was ordered. The waitress apologized and took it back. We waited another 35 minutes for the correct one to arrive. By then the place was packed and so noisy that it was hard to hear. The manager came over an apologized, saying the waitress was doing her best but she was all alone on the floor. He said, and did, take one of the pastries off the bill. I told him it was not necessary but it was removed. Nice guy, with a goal to have a successful downtown restaurant, cannot fault him for that. The acoustics are bad as all the surfaces are hard and the sound just bounces off and around. Everyone there was having a great time, that is for sure. It is a popular place and seemed to have a loyal following. I am happy to see downtown businesses doing well. The food was OK, not much more. Seems this is a place to meet friends, have drinks, a bit of fool and a lot of loud, noisy conversation. I liked the place, but it is not for me, but for young folks, go and have fun.",

Not that the food tasted nasty, or gross, it's just that there was no taste! My wife had the  Chicken Greek Pastie which thankfully had sun-dried tomatoes and olives to provide flavor. I had the Roast Dinner which based on the ingredients, I had high hopes for. Sadly there was no flavor in ANY of the ingredients. It honestly tasted like a boiled roast and potatoes, with NO seasonings added. No broth, No salt, No pepper, No bullion, and the roast beef was dry. I try to judge a plate or a meal on its own in my first 3 or 4 bites and then utilize the dipping sauces. The horseradish cream and red wine gravy were good which help salvage some of the experience, but I wasn't looking for a meal of side sauces to fulfill my appetite. Overall, very disappointing experience. The Scotch Egg was average, again minimal flavor in the egg and having to rely on the dipping sauce for any taste. Would not recommend this place for the food.  I really wanted to like it here, but just having a hard time falling for the place.",

But a couple of friends recently moved here and this is a regular meet up spot for us and we even celebrated our birthdays here on a Monday night.  Other great savory pasties I have enjoyed are the Guinness beef stew, Shepard's Pie, Cottage Pie and breakfast all day.  Desserts here are huge and can be shared by 3-4 people. My favorites are the Banoffee Pie (not for those who hate whipped cream), sticky toffee pudding, and apple pasty. The PBJ pasty is also good but I don't usually go for that flavor for dessert, might make a good breakfast? Skip the chocolate bread pudding, its pretty dry.  Whatever you do, order the Transatlantique Lambic Kriek beer!! I don't drink beer at all, but I am in love with this one.",

It's pretty spacious and I could imagine coming back with a group of friends for happy hour too shoot some pool. Other then that, their Pasties are the shit!!! I've had a plethora of pasties from here and I don't have a single complaint. My favorite ones are the Chicken Pot Pie, Italian, Carne Adovada, and The Royale with cheese. Excuse me for moment as I wipe the drool on the side of my mouth. Lol. Their service is also outstanding and often come check up on you to see if everything is ok. Kuddos!",

We chose to sit upstairs...in air cond!!! The place is very well ventilated so it was super comfortable temp-wise. Lots of flavors to choose from. Hmmm. Lots of rib-sticking savory flavs. So i chose Greek spanokopita mini-pasties fm appetizer menu. DH chose Italian. Ok. The crust is the key. Oooh they are on key! Flaky & tender. The spinach & feta is fresh w side of thick tzaziki. Our lovely server offers a side of marinara as she likes it. Perfect. Makes it almost like a spinach lasagna. So i had two cuisines in one dish. Btw, the little envelopes hold their heat! Hot hot hot. Which is a good thing for food!",

    "text": "I never bothered going out of my way to Tempe since I knew this would open here. It just took forever! Like YEARS of anticipation. So...does it live up to the hype? Yeah, kinda, enough to be a happy return customer.   CPC's draw is an abundance of stuffed pastries that give diners dozens of choices. They range from the traditional, with stuff like roast beef or hamburger with gravy. But that's a snooze. I like the southwestern varieties like Cajun Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala, and even their vegan meals, which I believe was some type of veggie vindaloo. My only complaint: the slightly sweet dough tries to be one-size fits all, but misses the mark. There's something about the bread that can work great with chicken and peppers, but can totally miss when fused with other styles of cuisine. It's not a big deal.  They're all much more filling than they appear. There's something for everyone. It's good. Whatever you order, start of with their wings. They are *huge*, the 'HP sauce' is delicious, and I just can't get enough of the Stilton sauce. My friend swears by the pate if that's your thing.  Aside from dining, keep in mind there are 3 floors, so it shouldn't be tough finding seating. The basement and second floor have a dive-y feel to them, which is good for socializing when Seamus and Valley Bar are just too loud for ya. To make things better, there's a limited cocktail menu, and a formidable assortment of roughly two dozen beers. You'll need them, as it seems impossible to bring anything out of the kitchen in under a half hour.   Overall, I'm just not seeing a reason to avoid this spot despite a couple of faults. It's one of those few restaurants you can take everyone to, and have your entire group at least content. It's that sort of reliability, along with variety, that will keep me coming back.",

There was a mix up and the waitress comes by to let us know she had ordered my food wrong and they were preparing it. She then asked if I would like a side salad, and I said yes. My Mom and sister were done when my food arrived. The waitress never came back to check on us, and then cleaned up the plates from my Mom and sister. I felt rushed. She finally came back and brought our check, to which I asked if she comped mine, to which she said no, she comped me a salad. After I asked for it to be.comped, she stormed off shaking her head. She never did ask how our food was and she overall was extemely rude.  The food was ok, however, the service was horrible!",

We were given a full menu, then a soft opening printed out menu with limited pasties available. I asked if the pasty I wanted was available and it wasn't. So I picked another one and my friend picked his off the same menu. I asked when will the full menu be available?  She said they've run out of things since they've been so busy. **I hate this excuse, you knew you were going to be slammed as hell, people have been waiting and waiting for this location to open; why wasn't enough inventory ordered to deal with the deluge of customers and orders you know you'll encounter? We ordered our drinks and chatted etc, 25 min pass and the bartender comes over and says to my friend they're out of the pasty he ordered. So he had to pick another one real quick. Why weren't we told this 25 min ago? We were thinking our food would have been coming out shortly. We waited over an hour and finally had our food show up. We were upstairs and it wasn't packed. Soft opening or not. Hopefully all pasties will be available soon and not running out again. The pasties were good when they arrived. I had the Reuben, was glad to see homemade 1000 island, my friend the meatball. The meatballs were extremely salty though. Definitely to much added to the batch. We got our check and we were charged for the Peppered steak pasty on top of the other two so had to tell the bartender we never received the peppered one since you said it was 86'd. This new location is going to be very busy so I look forward to a lil better experience next time like I've had at the Tempe and Mill Ave location.",

The food served here is every bit as good as those wonderful meals from years ago.   6 of us visited this location for lunch, everyone of us had a delightful lunch regardless of what we ordered.  I an sure that you would be hard pressed to find a Cajun or Mexican pasty in Cornwall or Wales, they are excellent entrees served here.   Advice:  Allow time for baking the Pastys, I not sure of the logistics at CPC, but it takes some time to bake a pasty even if prepared ahead.  This is not Subway, add that they recently opened and are still making changes to the building service will be slower than a Fast food place.   Yes, Pastys are a lot of dough, and it's substantial.  It needed to hang together being carried down into a tin or coal mine.  An 'official' pasty is closed on the side rather than the top, and this rim is used as a handle and not usually eaten.  CPC closes dinner pastys on top and dessert ones on the side, Mom's were always the opposite.  One suggestion, pre-cook or use fully ripe apples, they were a little under done. This is really good food, eat in or takeout.   Plan ahead to leave enough time to enjoy you meal, or order to go and finish baking at home.  Really great food!!!",

I went upstairs to find more seating and 2 pool stables. I couldn't decide what I wanted to try (the pasties all looked so good) so I got 1 and my brother got one and we split them. They both were amazing- the Ruben and the Carne Adovada (was a bit spicy but I love spicy foods). The crust was thin and crispy and the fillings tasted homemade. They also had some craft beers, I didn't have one but my brother had an IPA and said it was really good. If we weren't at an event I would have brought one home-- you can get it half baked to finish cooking at home. I believe if you get the Oggie you even get a small discount if it's take and bake.

This is by far the most authentic pasty shop in all of the US if not the world. The wisdom they displayed in serving their pasty in the Cornish manner is astounding to me. Upon the first bite I was rushed back to my childhood and reminded as a food historian this is truly what's worth preserving. Not many people are daring enough to put the crease of a pasty on the top. The margarine and salt used was spot on in 1905 when the pasty became an International symbol of Cornish. The price was slightly higher then I would have imagined however, prices at this fine establishment are actually done in pounds sterling keeping with the authentic experience of eating a pasty. Well worth it! Simply delightful.",

We waited another 10 min for water and 10 for the two drinks we ordered. They seemed to be out of a lot- lemonade, beers, vegan Pasties. Again, not a big deal. We waited 30 min for our food and when we got it they didn't give us silverware. We waited 10 min with hot food in front of us for the waitress to come back with only 2 sets (there were 5 of us). We dug in anyway, and it wasn't until we were 3/4 of the way done that we got the other 3 sets of silverware. On top of it all, 3 of us came down with severe food poisoning. We didn't eat anywhere else, so it had to have been from here.",

    "text": "The food is phenomenal, hands down! Love the atmosphere, from the pool tables upstairs to the old Italian booth seating in the dungeon. There are bars located on all 3 floors, super convenient and should make things go smoothly. It definitely has an edgy vibe, with interior and most guests doting black, slight goth meets new English pub. The pilgrim is a must try on the menu, also the chicken pot pie will make you feel like your home. I give four stars simply because of the service. While I attended the soft opening and after several times, I was highly disappointed in the service. Granted, I've taken into account soft openings and openings in general, but it seemed as though most of these servers/bartenders didn't have a clue as to how you  actually serve patrons. From having staff just stare at me when I come in without speaking, to being completely forgotten about at a table and having to ask for someone else to bring drinks, silverware and eventually food, amongst other things that aren't necessary to explain. It's a great place, decor, food, liveliness, but the staff sure needs some training in plain old customer service. Will I go back? Yes, because the food is that brilliant.",

What I don't expect is when some entitled people come in just like other places downtown and throw a fit when things are set in front of them right away.  Last night had to listen to this obnoxious man(being nice about it) complain he had to wait for his food. It takes time to cook something unless it's pre-made! What this place does need is a bouncer at the door to kick people like that out so the staff doesn't get frazzled and everyone else can enjoy.",

Myself and a couple others chose to try this place out as it was close to where we were, and it didn't disappoint.  We had gotten to the restaurant before the theater crowd showed up, sat downstairs and it felt like a True British Pub.   Shortly after getting our beverages, it started to get a little busy, yet the wait staff couldn't have been more professional and on point, especially since it appeared many of the patrons were on a time limit.  I ordered the Bangers and Mash pasty, along with Salt & Pepper Chips (fries) the pasty was awesome, while the fries fell just a little short of True English style chips.  One of my companions ordered a salad, and the other ordered a different type of pasty. Needless to say, we all did a pretty good job devouring our food.  I would definitely go back and order a different type of pasty as the food was very good.",

    "text": "\"Eating out doesn't have to be a formula. Eating out is about having fun. I get really frustrated when it's badly done.\"  Gordon Ramsay  Wow, what a location! We managed to snag a sweet spot in the upstairs loft by the windows that look out into Downtown Phoenix. Eleven of us squeezed ourselves into two church pews and a table. We had Oven Chips (one garlic and one jalapeno, the garlic fries were better), a Cobb Salad, and ten different kinds of pasties. Scooby Doo shots were had (Thanks, Simona!), cocktails were stiff, waters were filled, and food was demolished.  Cornish Pasty throughout the valley is pretty consistent but this location might edge out the rest from the views alone.  It's super dark inside as per usual and many of us blind bats had to rely on our phones to light up our menus but hey, it's all good.  Some of my favorites are the Shepherd's Pie, The Pilgrim, and Roast Dinner.  The Italian is also a great alternative to a calzone if you're in the mood for a cheese bomb.  Whatever you choose, I'm sure it will be an amazing bite.  Enjoy!",

I've had a ton of the Pastys. I've sampled more than 20 different kinds. Never ask the server / bartender which are their favorite because there are too many killer patsys- spanning different flavors - and countries. I genuinely like almost every one I've tasted. Don't ask the server which are their favorite - it's impossible to answer. Ask the server which they don't like - which will likely equal one or two out of 45.   Literally 25 of the 30 meat based pastys on the menu are insane!!!  Please try everything that looks good to you. The only things I didn't like were some of the apps.   The pasty rock!!!",

I make it a point to stop by a Cornish Pasty Co at least once every trip and I'm leaving a 5 star review at this particular branch because this one I had were the best tasting ones and the employees were awesome.  Seems like I went during an off-hour timing since it wasn't that busy and everyone was very chill.  The nice servers really tried to keep me feeling at home. (I think the Scottsdale and a few locations have really awesome servers as well!)  This location was the one that really made me wish one like this one existed in DTLA or Culver City. (which would fit in really nicely)  Anyways, keep on doing whacha'll doin.  The pasties are amazing.  Especially the non-traditional ones.  They reheat well so I enjoy keeping a couple extra in the hotel room when I'm way too tired but I need dinner.  I even brought a few back to LA and probably will do so again soon, hopefully. :)",

There were 3 of us and we shared 2 and some fries which was plenty of food.  We had the New Mexico one and the special that day which was corned beef.

The restaurant itself is really kool the inside set up of upstairs and downstairs creates a kool vibe. When we first got there we we told to seat ourselves.  We were still waiting for someone so we just ordered waters to start. In the beginning me and my friends kinda got an icey vibe from the waitress.  I'm happy to say though that did change.  We ended up ordering drinks and the drink I wanted wasn't available.  I'm super weird about trying new things but the Ace space blood orange ale I ordered was great. I'm a picky eater and was hesitant at first because everything is premixed and the 5 or 6 options I wanted all had something in them I can't eat. But I found an option that would work and I was able to pick out the mushrooms.  I ended up ordering the pesto chicken pastry.  Let me tell you every bite of this was heaven on a plate. For desert I ordered the bonoffe pie but with no whip cream.  It was delicious.    When I travel I love to try out new places and places I can't eat at back home.  However I did find out they have a Vegas location as well and I was happy to hear so. I will be checking the Vegas location out soon.",

I wasn't sure how that would turn out, but I was pleasantly surprised. My salad was filled with fresh ingredients and the chicken was perfect.

Other members of my party had a wide selection of the pasties, and overall we were very happy. Portion size of the pasty is quite generous, and I believe most, if not all, come with a dipping sauce.   The beer selection was great. The only disappointment was they did not have black current to do a traditional \"cider and black\" from England.   Overall, definitely worth a visit for locals and non-locals.",

I enjoy those hearty types of meals at times, but they are hard to find without meat.  I have been wanting to get back here to try one of the many other vegetarian pasty selections from the menu.

I would have given this place 4 stars, but my experience at this location was disappointing to say the least.   I called in for pick up at 12. Person said it would be ready in 15 minutes. I got there around 12:25, which means my food should be ready to go.   Asked the waitress if this was where I picked up. She said it is, hold up. I wait on her. Then she give me my check and I sign for it. She then completely ignores the fact that I am even there, attending to everyone else, while I'm still clueless to where my order is.   I wait another ten minutes before I stop her and asked if my order was ready and she goes and check. I noticed upon arrival that there was a to go order in a black bag sitting there. The guy sitting next to the bag told me it's been sitting there for a while. She then tells me that order was mine. Had I not said anything, I would have still been there waiting not knowing when or where my order was.   What's the point of a to go order if it's as slow as if I was dining there?   Aside from that, the food isn't bad. And the gravy on top of the pasty just adds that much more flavor.   The atmosphere provides a great little hangout spot on the second floor. Pool, darts, bar, and tables accompanied by the church-like seating.",

I appreciate an owner who reached out to customers and I hope he has improved this location. +1*  Maybe it's me. I have tried several of the Pasty locations and haven't really loved any of them. This one, though, was particularly bad. Granted, I went here with a friend shortly after they opened, so maybe that was part of the problem. We arrived late -ish (around 9 pm). We ordered a Royale with Cheese at the suggestion of our waitress and a couple of beers. We then proceeded to sit there for over 2 hours. 2 HOURS! What happened? Apparently, they gave our food to someone else and didn't realize it. Then they ran out of premade Royale with Cheese Pasties and had to make a new one (or something). I have no idea, but we wasted our whole night sitting there. Then when we finally received the food, it wasn't good. It was super greasy. Not only that, but I wanted a different sauce to go with it and no one came to ask if we needed anything. Let me remind you, we had been sitting there waiting for 2 HOURS and then no one came to ask how the food was or to see if we needed anything...... that is insane. I just ate the greasy pasty without a sauce. The waitress ended up comping the pasty (but not the beers), so that was ok..... I mean, really I feel like they should have comped the entire meal given that their errors interrupted any plans we may have had that night, and their service was so non existent, we couldn't even cancel the order and leave.   PS the decor is nice enough, they have a decent patio, and their beer list was alright (though their draft beers were a bit pricier than other places around town).",

I ordered the Reuben. Nice and fluffy crust with all the fittings you'd expect in a Reuben. I loved my food. My friend complained that it was too hot and burned his mouth a couple of times  The real bummer moment for me was when I finished my food. I found a rather large piece of hair underneath my pastry. I let my waitress know and man was she embarrassed (it wasn't her hair). They were cool enough to take care of me and apologized many times. I get it, shit happens. But it's always the cool ones who actually do something about it and not just shrug to shit happening. I'll be back",

They had never been to any of the locations so I was excited to have them experience a favorite of mine. We went after they had a busy Friday/Saturday so the menu was more limited but everyone still found something that was appealing and our lunch was excellent. Tonight though we went after happy hour with friends and since I had just been I wanted to do a different pasty than my typical rotation. I had been avoiding the cottage pie because it seemed to simple compared to the rest of the adventurous menu choices but I went for it- it was literally one of the best things I've ever eaten! I love cottage pie typically, but in pasty form it's to die for! I cleared my plate, which rarely happens because portions are so generous. No wait for a table, our waitress was attentive, and our food came out quick. You really can't go wrong with Cornish Pasty!",

I've tried like 3 or 4 different ones and have not been disappointed yet. There are three floors in this bar, which is crazy to me living in the bay. But it's really cool and guarantees you can get a drink quickly and strongly at any of the three floors. Downstairs is my favorite, if I'm being honest- it's probably the best floor to end your night at. Upstairs is for the start of the night, before getting TOO lit. I'm going back to phoenix in about a month and I'm drooling right now as I type this thinking about the Philly cheesesteak pasty I'm ordering as soon as we hit Cornish Pasty",

Ask for the vegan pasty of the day...the vegetable vindaloo is one is great. Cider on tap. You can't go wrong here. They even have gluten free items...you can bring your paleo friends and make them jealous by eating a pasty right in front of them. ;P",

I appreciated their soft launch menu to ensure they could handle the volume and make all the hungry guests happy.

I bought a small sampling of different pasties, including traditional sausage rolls, beef and mushroom, and the vegetarian option, spinach and feta. We reheated everything for dinner several hours later, but nothing suffered the delay. The pastry was crisp and not too greasy; pasties were light but packed with well-seasoned filling.   Additionally, there's a well-stocked British goods section--Branston pickle, Heinz beans, Robinson's squash, and just about every kind of candy bar you would want. As I was checking out, I noticed a bowl of Scottish butter tablets, and grabbed a few for ol' memories' sake! I can buy much of this at Wegmans, and even have standing Amazon orders for PG Tips and Heinz beans, but seeing everything together with the pasties was a bit like being in England again!  I had read the rave reviews in WaPo, but never took the time and opportunity to go because it's so out of my way, but for a quick fix for authentic British fare, we will be back!",

I tried to have it excluded but since the pasty takes time to make, they are not able to modify what is listed on the menu.

I sat at the bar upstairs.  Brownie points for having purse hooks under the bar!  The bartender was very distracted and the only person behind the bar besides someone washing glasses.  She seemed annoyed since I only ordered water.  I tried to flag her down forever to order a pasty.  It took a really long time to get her attention.  Once she came over, she said the restaurant was out of my first three choices.  I heard her go through this with everyone around me - out of most pasties, salads, appetizers...it was pretty ridiculous.  I settled on lamb and mint.  It took a long while to come out, and of course it came without silverware or napkins.  The food runner found some for me eventually.    The pasty was burnt, and the lamb was dry, a bit fatty, and hard to chew.  When I finished, the server came by and I asked to close out since she took my card to start a tab.  She immediately got distracted and returned to making drinks.  I tried to flag her down until she finally brought my bill.  I just wanted to get the heck out of here.  I do not recommend coming - if a Monday night has no food or service, it must be worse as it nears the weekend.",

A pasty is essentially a meat hand pie, but Cornish Pasty would challenge even that definition as they have vegetarian and even vegan pasties! Their selection here of pasties is simply incredible. They have some of the classic fillings you would find in a pasty and some new ones I have never seen before as they are very creative.   As this is pub the interior is pretty dim and the vibe is ulta-casual. My colleague and I had lunch here when we were attending a conference (bonus: short walking distance from the Phoenix Conference Center) and we sat upstairs at their bar area. The bartender was friendly and attentive and brought us drinks right away. My colleague tried a few of their beers here and seemed to enjoy them. I didn't have a beer but noticed they had a pretty good selection.   I settled on ordered the Guinness Stew pasty ($12.00) which has beef simmered in a Guinness gravy, with red potato, mushrooms, carrot, and celery. Layered with cheddar, sauteed leeks and cabbage. It is served with a side of sour cream with chives in it. I devoured this pasty then waddled back to the conference. I did not eat dinner that night because I was both still full and not wanting anything to eat that wasn't as good as a pasty.   I wish that where I live there is a pasty place but because there is not this place would be top of my list to come back to next time I'm in Phoenix! Great food, casual atmosphere and good service made for a great experience.",

Cornish Pasty is directly next to our building, no reason why we didn't stop in sooner. We're all fans now!   Between the three of us we tried the tomato soup (delicious), the Italian, the Carne Adovada, and the Cubano. We all tried each other's food and enjoyed everything but the Italian and the tomato soup took the damn cake! The Italian is exactly what you would imagine, picture a warm Italian sub in a pastry kinda. Pepperoni, ham, salami, fresh basil, mozzarella and a side of warm marinara sauce. It's EXCELLENT!! Don't miss out on this gem!",

But I gotta give a quick shout-out to this obviously popular and well-loved pasty (no, not Patsy, nor pastey. That's pasty with a short \"a\") shop.   Seasoned goodies through whatever means nestled inside delectable hot bread is perhaps the one thing all 7billion of us can agree is a most exquisite invention, so I won't waste your time telling you how magnificent the dishes were. What I will say is the vegetarian options are out-o-freakin-sight! I don't remember a non exclusively-vegetarian or otherwise Asian food place I've been with so many. And beyond the sheer volume of options is the brilliant array and selection of meatless products. The Qorn brand chick'n they use is absolutely worthy of an omnivore's appetite, but they also had faux pork and beef and included a jackfruit based protein.  My second shout-out is to the cellar bartender. I don't recall her name; I want to say it was Brittany. But on a D-E-D Tuesday evening, she kept me company most wonderfully and offered the perfect balance of conversation and mind-your-own. Her suggestions were great and her charming personality just added delightfully to my experience of the place.   The place picked up around 8 or so, BTW. Pretty sure the locals love it here.",

Had the opportunity to meet with the developers during the summer expressing the amount of time taken to make this place absolutely perfect per the owners request. Even pushing back the due date just to make sure it was perfect.   Location and decor are spot on for a pasty establishment. Meeting with the bartender downstairs, come to find out it use to be a speakeasy with a hidden staircase leading from the street level. Pretty cool.   Then there's the food. Today we brought the family, which is also great for kids as well as couples and friends. We started as always with their bread and butter... everyone loves it... I always opt for a Kronenbourg 1664 (yep on tap) and my wife grabbed one of their many delicious cocktails.   Their tomato soup is amazing and made fresh in-house... we shared many things such as the pasta salad, The Royale with Cheese, and the Cajun Chicken. All really hit the spot with plenty left overs for dinner.   Really enjoy the history behind the pasty as well.   I highly recommend this to anyone...",

Having been to their Tempe location(s) on multiple occasions, I'm still working my way through the menu.      I love the vibe in the place, their eclectic music playlist, and of course the unique food and craft beer selection.   One my visit, we sat on the main level and service was great.     I've begun to try their vegetarian options and recently had the Veggie Cottage Pie with vegetarian \"ground beef\".  To be totally honest, I could not tell by taste or texture that the Quorn brand vegetarian ground beef wasn't the real thing.  It was delicious.    Last night, when we ordered pasty's for the family via Postmates, I had the good old fashioned Royale with Cheese...with real beef.  It did not disappoint.  Go with the 1000 island!    Kudos to both Cornish Pasty and Postmates because all four of our Pastys were at the perfect eating temperature when they were delivered.",

This is like a cross of Victorian England and a modern pub.  The pastys are, it is often said, like upgraded \"hot pockets.\"  They have a ton of flavors.  The PILGRIM is by far my favorite and is a pocket of Thanksgiving warmy goodness.  So is the Cubano, you can never go wrong with a Cubano.  You can't substitute ingredients.  They are pre-made in house, closed, then baked. Pastys are the ultimate comfort food. Basically, take all your favorite things and then wrap them in a pastry and bake it. OKAY. You can't ask for much more.   Happy hour has great prices for mules and beer on tap!  Seriously give this place a try. Perfect for a cold, rainy day, or a late night bite. Or pretty much whenever you feel like eating a bunch of comfort food (so always).",

This rustic pub /restaurant had both upstairs and downstairs seating. Friendly wait staff and interesting and extensive menu. Lots of Pasty options.  I like beer and I am an avid coffee drinker .... so, it is no surprise that I needed to try the coffee infused beer. It was cool and refreshing on a hot day in Phoenix - surprisingly tasty. To compliment my beer, I ordered a pasty called the Pilgrim. I was delicious - small pie loaded with roasted turkey, grilled onions, stuffing and sweet potatoes. This came with a dipping sauce of red wine gravy and cranberries.   Good food, great atmosphere, helpful staff and competitively priced.",

The basement is kinda an old speak easy there's even a hidden trap door above the side walk where people used to come in. The middle floor is the main floor where u can watch them make the pasty's which if you are really hungry will make you order the entire menu. The top floor is very comfy and casual and has pool tables and couches. This is a really fun and down to earth establishment.    Now the food is really good and filling I cannot eat a full pasty myself so I always have left overs. My favorites are the cubano, the Italian and the pilgrim. Don't forget to try the Scotch egg and the Cornish meatballs.  You have to save room for dessert the peanut butter and jelly pasty is really good and so is the banoffe pie.   I also love there cocktail menu their rum drinks are my favorite.",

The ground floor has a bar but most will head upstairs to fine more seating, another bar, pool tables and darts.  The menu appears to be more of a list of things they \"sometimes have\" so be prepared with second, third or even fourth choices. They were about of 2/3 of the apps on our visit leaving only wings available. So we had soup, which was pretty good.   There were out of about 1/3 of the pasty choices as well. My coworker was sad to miss the chicken pot pie - her second choice (pork, apple, sage) was \"ok\" but she said she'd probably have something else next time. My first choice was unavailable as well so I had a tikka masala pasty ($13?). It was HUGE - definitely enough to fill a hungry person up, and had a crust that would make Paul Hollywood proud. The filling was \"ok\" - I appreciated that it was a little spicy.   Service was great - never had to wait for anything honestly. A bonus is a really nice wine list at fair prices.   Overall, I liked it and would definitely come back. Hopefully, they're not out of everything I want to try!",

    "text": "Cornish Pasty is one of my favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area for sure, though the downtown location is not my favorite. It's very often quite busy, so you usually end up waiting about an hour for your pasty if it's a weekend. Which is totally fine if you plan ahead, but very anxiety-inducing if you're like me and rushing to get to a concert and high strung to begin with. The service is usually decent but nothing to write home about; sometimes you gotta work fairly hard to flag down a server if it's hoppin' and they're all busy. It's a seat yourself situation, so they don't always notice when a new table comes along.   However, 10 out of 10 times, I would say that all of this is worth the food.  It is truly one of my favorite Phoenix restaurants and I always recommend that out of towners swing by. I've had probably half of the menu at this point, but my tried and True go-to is the rosemary chicken. Ugh so flaky and delicious and wonderful and perfect. Another tried and True is the guiness stew; and that one is probably a little more hearty and unique. Plus! My vegetarian friends love that you can get vegetarian/vegan options!  They always have a really solid beer selection, as well as a full bar, so it's a great place to grab a drink. Never been for happy hour, but it's on my list to check out soon!",

My issue with the food is that it didn't have much flavor. My original choices were some of their spicier options, maybe if they were available I'd feel different about the food. A couple of suggestions, maybe they should go to having a chalkboard type menu and just list the pasty's they have and have more than one server/bartender on the main level.

This new location is massive.

I typically got the delicious vegetarian eggplant parmesan pasty, but I decided to try the Lovely Bit of Salmon and it was indeed lovely. The salmon was delicious and tasted amazing in a pasty filled with asparagus, tomatoes, spinach and potatoes. I also tried out the Apple Caramel Pasty with ice cream for dessert which was delicious.   I've read some other reviews about slow service and have to say that I experienced the opposite. While there, our waitress came up to apologize about the wait for our food (which really didn't seem abnormally long) and us offered the free dessert. How amazing is that?!?!

    "text": "I really, really wanted to love this place. I love a great urban patio, and this has it.  The space is amazing; beautiful old building with indoor/outdoor bar/patio.  I secured a great table on the street for people watching on a magnificent Saturday afternoon.  While my husband parked, i got a Guinness.  I let the server know there would be 2 of us.   He arrived shortly after, and we commenced to wait and wait and wait.  As we scanned, we could see the server was doing the entire first floor including bar-tending and cashier.  We finally after about 15 - 20 minutes asked a kitchen staff to grab our waitress.   A few minutes later she was back and took his drink order.  She also let us know the kitchen was understaffed and our food would take 35 minutes.  OK.  We had a great table and nothing else to do so fine.  But we put in our order.  My husband is vegan and that drew us here as they had a huge selection for him.  But, she advised they had only 1 of the vegan pastys available.  So he ordered that. Later she returned to advise his first choice was available after all.  The food did finally arrive in about 30 minutes.  I ordered a meat and cheese pasty and it was amazing.  Golden brown crust, spiced sausage and wine dipping sauce.  I ate every bite.  My husbands, however, was  visibly under-cooked.  He ate the brown part and liked it but as he worked his way down it became less done until it was finally raw.  He just at that point ate the filling.  I get places being understaffed on occasion, but she expressed no remorse for the horrible service or food.  We also had to send back a cocktail that was wrong, and she said oh i know what i did wrong.  The fixed one was no better.  Never an apology.  I'd love to try again, but not sure i can get my husband back.   Very sad as I was sure this was going to be my new favorite place.  A beautiful space cannot make up for a bad experience.  It wasn't even that crowded.",

This one seems to have more of a bar atmosphere than the one in Flagstaff, but of course it is Friday night. The music and the crowd were loud but we still managed a good conversation. We had a nice table by the window upstairs. Our primary server was nice and helpful, our secondary food server was full of attitude and rather gruff. The food was great! I had the chicken Greek and my wife had the roast. We shared the curried potatoes. We had the apple caramel pastie for dessert. The apples weren't done enough and all of the caramel and cinnamon were on one end. Overall the amount of food and taste were a good value for the money!",

We were their 3rd official customers and within the first few bites we knew it was our new favorite lunch spot in downtown Phoenix! Very cool tri-level space with an English pub feel. We sat in a church pew-like table on the main floor and the place was getting pretty packed around lunchtime.  We started off with an order of Scotch Eggs (my 1st time) and it was super tasty.. wish there were more than four slices but flavors did not disappoint.  As for our main orders.. I ordered the Roast Beef Sarnie (like an English take of a Philly) and it was so delicious!  Amazing crust, the best ingredients, and they were huge! The others ordered The Pilgrim x2 (Thanksgiving pasty) and the Oggie (the original pasty). They were all yummy, but I loved mine the most!  Loved the food so much, we recommended it to 2 other folks at work who each ordered the Reuben Pasty and they both had rave reviews.  One of the co-workers even went back the next day; that's how good it was!  And I plan on taking the husband this weekend so he can try, too!  Food was amazing.. service was outstanding & food did not take long to be prep'd during the lunch crowd.. Also, reasonable pricing as most Pasties were between $10-$12.. Portion is huge enough to share, but you probably won't want to share, lol! The only downside is there isn't a location near me in NW Peoria, but hopefully in the near future :)",

I have never tried pasty before so I can not vouch for how authentic it is however our server explained this dish very well ... a pastry and calzone had a baby. I loved the fresh baked pasties.  The one star is taken away only because we went here for late lunch and the first 3-4 items we asked for were all over. Good sign I guess however I wish the server let us know before hand. Instead each time we asked for something the server had to go in come back again and tell us to pick something else. I will definitely come back to try the chicken tikka and lamb mint.   Anyways ... so in this visit we tried the Shepherd's Pie Pasty & Salmon with asparagus & dill pasty both were good but I liked the salmon one better since it was juicy and unexpectedly good. I have never had salmon calzone or pastry so I thought this was very innovative.",

We were served by a bar tender and started with the tandoori chicken wings, very tasty! We split the cheeseburger royale as our entree, which we both enjoyed other than picking out the mushrooms. My only complaint about Cornish is that you cannot customize because they make the pasties ahead of time and just bake them when ordered. We were offered a nice selection of adult beverages and enjoyed the dark and swanky atmosphere this level offers. A good value for the food and just a neat place to bring out of town guests or when looking for a great meal when in downtown Phoenix.",

A tip from me to you, if you get chips (fries), ask for a side of HP sauce. It's a better than ketchup.  The location is near Walking Stick, makes for a great choice pre show to avoid the high costs of the food.

I go to multiple locations probably once a week.  BUT, this particular location REALLY needs some help.  I feel they are about 4 crew members down all the time.  Food is always great, but SLOW SLOW SLOW.  Don't sit at the bar, no bar back and service really suffers because of it, because they are constantly washing dishes to keep up.   As I type this I have waited at least 30 minutes for my favorite desert.   My server is busting his ass running all around, but you cannot have one person having the entire top area, at least that is what appears to be happening.  Again, love the place, BUT, staff UP!

Next time I will try the lounge since it was just me dining and I didn't need all the extra noise around me.  I tried the mushroom, walnut, spinach soup. It was delicious, very hearty and nutty. I don't like mushrooms at all but thought I'd give it a whirl. I ate almost all, and the bread it came with was nice, soft and dense. Like a good sourdough (but not sourdough). I could have had this as my meal alone and been happy.  The pasty's, they have soo many! It made choosing very hard. I decided to try bangers and mash, because I usually love the dish. It was cooked nicely and def a very generous portion size (esp with the soup) but there was some kind of spice they used in it that I did not care for. I have no idea what it was but it was too seasoned for a normal bangers and mash (which is pretty meat and potatoes style dish). The sauce it came with too didn't go with the flow of the pasty and would be better with a mustard I feel.   I am hoping with another visit and a different pasty (thanksgiving, Rueben and chicken pot pie are a couple I'm looking at) I'm hoping to be able to have a good experience. I love a good pasty!",

They crispy and taste good depending on your selection but presentation is below average. Served with just any sauce. They should definitely supplement pasty with some in house gravy. I ordered one (pastrami one) and server told they are sold out, so i had to select another and again she returned after 10 mins that they are sold out with that too.  I had to order #3 pesto chicken one and it tasted good. Other 2 friends and my wife ordered another 3 varieties and I would say mine was best tasting. 1 of the 4 was chicken tikka pasty and it was literally indian tikka curry inside pasty. So heavy and senseless expectations for any twist. Chicken pot pie was good but nothing special.  Average 11-13$ for just a pasty is not pricing they should offer.",

It has nice seating and can be a little quieter on a busy evening.  Upstairs is where the younger crowd seems to hangout and it can be loud, but good to meet people!  We have yet to have a pasty we didn't enjoy.  Today we had the spicy chicken Asiago and Greek chicken.  Both were incredible and True to their taste.  Our favorite though has to be the pot pie!! The way the pasty is expertly cooked to crispy perfection matches the amazing combination of ingredients inside.  If you have never been here, don't pass it by again!",

There a certain charm about this place. I couldn't get enough pics. I'm a happy camper for sure! And this is one more place I recommend.",

Great place to grab a bite with a brew. Awesome for hangover food the next day. If you want to take some pasty's with you, for the loved ones, you can ask for the frozen ones to take home.

It's interesting that this Cornish Pasty has such a different vibe from the one in Scottsdale. Both have their own merits.  Of course, I had to order the same thing that I've had several times: The Pilgrim (just liking that Thanksgiving feeling with the cranberries, yum). However, this time my Pilgrim had way too much dark meat. It's a sign: time to try something else the next time I'm in! Actually, I'm rather thankful that the Pilgrim just didn't do it for me this time since the menu has been screaming at me to try something else. There are so many good things on the menu! I can hardly wait to go back now that I'm liberated from the Pilgrim.   Guinness on draft ... not as perfect as being in Dublin and having a Guinness on draft, but it'll have to do.",

Downtown is a bit more busy than some of the other locations but like the Tempe location, there are several spaces within the building to install yourself, depending on your mood. Personally, upstairs is my favorite for solo dining and drinking but the street patio bar is great for friends. You'll find an extensive tap list of craft brews with something for everyone. And, when it comes to pasties, eat your heart out on the variety. Hipster staff with a good patron mix and excellent vibes abound here.  Oh!  And Jimmy just told me the stage is complete and they'll bring live music in soon. Can't wait!",

If you are craving a Cornish pasty and you are not fortunate enough to be surrounded by English pubs, the Cornish Pasty Company has transplanted merrie olde Englande to the Phoenix area.   The atmosphere almost replicates those darkly cavernous pubs found in the West Country of England. Although a pint of scrumpy is not on the menu, all manner of fillings are available for your gastronomic enjoyment.   If you are a purist, then the only pasty you are going to choose is the original-the Oggie. And it really is! Once you have ordered this numerous times, you may be tempted to try one of the other delicious flavors.  This is the place for downtown chow, but you'll also get what you want at any of the Cornish Pasty Co eateries. Try this place out!",

    "text": "I get it. This place is supposed to be hip. Literally, it's a hipster haven. I have nothing against hipsters, but I can't just give the Cornish Pasty 5-stars because to do otherwise is uncool. The truth is, there are a few things they could improve upon.  First, let's start with the good. The atmosphere/vibe of the place is different/neat. I like the dim lighting. Not everyone in my party loved it, but I don't mind (aside from it being difficult to read the menu). I dig the three stories and how every floor has a different vibe. The music was good; heavy on the Allah-Las, whom I happen to love. The English pub theme is actually really awesome. Oh and everyone seemingly enjoyed all of their pasties.  So what's not to like?  Well, the servers were okay, but we had about three different ones. With that, there seemed to be some miscommunication. My wife's pasty didn't make it out until the rest of our group had finished ours.  No one seemed to come around to refill our drinks, so I had to run to the bartender across the restaurant to do that. The same deal with napkins and straws. Lastly, we ordered wings specifically with no sauce for the kids and they came out smothered in sauce, so the kids had to wait awhile to eat as well.   Even though they held it back, I got the sense that the servers were slightly annoyed by our special requests (the naked wings & no ice in the drinks for my European in-laws). With all of this taken into consideration, it took what could've been a great experience and turned it into a pretty average one.",

Granted we were there late, but he was seemingly upset with us when we told him we we there for food not drinks. Also waited a long time for water refills and never got more than one.   It took us a far too long to get our order in, our food, and our bill. We were there much longer than we needed to be and ended up bailing on dessert since we didn't want to wait another 30 mins for that.   I may come back again but definitely opt for other locations around the valley",

It's a bit darkish on the inside, but it really creates a nice atmosphere where people can sit and enjoy each other's company. Even during a busy evening the service did not lack, and seeing so many delicious entrees passing by made the wait so much more worth it. When I say EVERYTHING that came out of the kitchen looked good I mean it. I saw a banoffee pie sneak out that made me regret not saving room for dessert. I was in a party of 3 so we tried each other's meals (2 pasty's, 1 Cobb salad, some fries, and cheesy broccoli bake). There were no bites that were less than tastefully orgasmic. I apologize for the use of the word, but the explosions of flavors in my mouth were legendary. Even my friend (from the UK) highly enjoyed it. I was more upset that my stomach couldn't hold more than it can. You will not go wrong with this choice. Also, everything was very affordable and the restaurant was kept nice and cool.

He's relocated to the hip section of downtown Phoenix and restaurant scene has some great options.  And for an authentic Montana raised (wannabe) cowboy like myself, pasty's (a Butte, America standard) are always a welcome addition to any menu, let alone one with two dozen options!  We sat outside on a beautiful fall Phoenix day, the restaurant faces north so there was plenty of shade to be had.  Service was fantastic from a cheerful, tattooed, redhead (The P is a ginger so I'm partial).   T got the Turkey dinner pasty and I went with the Cubano.  He enjoyed his but I think my Cubano was the better of the two.  The pasty's are made right in front of the bar and popped into the oven for finishing.  This is not McDonalds, it takes a few minutes to properly bake a pasty and it's worth it.  Nice hot, flaky crust and a cold beverage on a perfect day.  Did I say I was riding right before lunch?  It just doesn't get a whole lot better.  I'm looking forward to coming back for dinner and enjoying the old bar inside, great vibe, no charge pool and darts, and a second floor looking out over downtown Phoenix.  I almost felt like I was shuttled back to the mining days of Butte, MT.  Great place!",

Take flavorful meat, cheese, unique vegetable combinations, wrap it up in a flakey pastry, then bake it until hot inside and crispy outside.  Serve it up with a side dipping sauce, it doesn't get much better. While your waiting  for your delicious entree, take advantage of the great beer selection the Cornish Pasty Company has to offer.  Sip on a ice cold draft from a great selection while your delicious entree is baking.    The Cornish Pasty Company has a great atmosphere, very casual and comfortable.  Wish my phone wqs working because I would have taken pictures. I would  definitely go back to the Cornish Pasty Company again and again.",

    "text": "Wow, just wow. This spot makes me question all the negativity I've heard over the years towards British food; it's all BS folks. This spot is great. I ordered the original oggie, an iron maiden beer, and toffee bread pudding for dessert. The steak in the oggie was seasoned with the right amount of pepper and complimented the gravy and flaky crust perfectly. Not a huge beer drinker but this was pleasant: malty with hints of citrus. I friggin' loved the dessert; not too sweet and delicious with the vanilla ice cream.   The atmosphere varies based on where you sit or what you're in the mood for, e.g. downstairs = romantic date?, upstairs = play time with billiards &/or darts, and plenty of bar seating. You gotta check it out!",

Went in about 9 on a Friday night & sat at the bar. The staff at the bar were all friendly, not just the miss that was serving us. I had the sloe gin cherry fizz, which was very refreshing & perfectly sweet. Fiance & I shared the cottage pie & Cajun chicken pasties. Both were delicious! The gravy was intense, a little goes a long way. Can't wait to come back here & make it more of a habit.",

We wanted to take a look at their menu and get a good draft beer to take the heat off of the sweltering evening.   The pasty options are amazing - taking up an entire page of the large menu. We sat at the bar and watched them making a batch of 12 pasties. Their chef carefully constructed each pasty and cleaned the tables so meticulously. It was fun to watch!   We have a British restaurant in our home town and we were so excited to see mushy peas on the menu! We ordered some even though we already ate dinner a few hours before. They were cooked in a little cast iron pot and tasted delicious.   The bartender was super friendly and efficient. Beer selection is solid. Hoping to get back to try a pasty before we leave town.",

    "text": "There are few restaurants I can remember in the valley that had more buildup, more anticipation, more frustration, and more confusion than when Dean Thomas decided to open his fourth valley Cornish Pasty location in Downtown Phoenix.  What started out as universal excitement soon turned into a years long nightmare for Thomas and a long confusing wait for Downtown patrons.  Dean was determined to make his Downtown Phoenix location the biggest and best in the chain and bought out a huge three story space on Central & Monroe back in 2010 to prove it.  But the more they renovated, the more problems they encountered (including having to rebuild all the building utilities from scratch).  Thomas was constantly forced to move back opening date due to all the calamities (and the escalating costs).  Seven years after Dean got the keys to the space, Cornish Pasty finally opened in Spring 2017.  Having been to Dean's restaurants in Tempe and Scottsdale, I was joyous.  For today's Saturday lunch, it was time to give the new place a spin.  Located directly across the street from Seamus McCaffrey's, Cornish Pasty's newest location evokes many of the familiar vibes you've probably encountered at their other locations, but with a larger and arguably more energetic vibe.  The basement floor in particular reminded me of Pasty's Tempe location with its darkly lit room, dark trimmed booths, and wooden accents.  The top floor is also somewhat dimly lit with wooden furniture all around, but with almost a sports bar feel with pool tables and its own separate bar.  And then of course there's the ground level, reminding me a lot of their Scottsdale location with patio seating out front and bar area seating that looks out over the kitchen.  At max capacity I'd guess the new Pasty can seat between 150-200 people.  A couple friends and I were able to get seating upstairs right away during today, but it was still an almost full house.  There are three main reasons why all the Pasty locations get 4.5 stars on Yelp.  For one, Pasty has an abundant beer selection on tap (typically a couple dozen) and there are usually multiple bar areas so as to serve patrons quickly (the Downtown location has three separate tap stations).  Another reason?  The pasties of course.  A wide array of foods stuffed into a pastry dough then cooked until the dough is hot and flaky and the ingredients inside are warm and stick to your ribs.  The third reason Pasty is so popular?  The prices.  The original location in Tempe opened with the idea of gaining traction with the legions of poor starving ASU students, and today you can still get a full sized pasty and a beer for $20 or less.  As this was my first meal at the new location, I decided to do a throwback to my first visit at the Tempe location.  I ordered the same thing I ordered all those years ago in Tempe.  A glass of Hoegaarden White Ale and a whole Chicken Pot Pie Pasty.  Total cost including tax and tip came to about $22.  The pasties may not look like a lot of food when you first order them, but there's pretty much no way you'll leave hungry if you have a whole one.  In fact most people I've dined with are good after a half pasty.  Me?  Well I couldn't help myself to all the chicken, carrots, green beans, red potatoes, celery, rosemary, and onion.  Oh and of course the gravy that comes on the side.  Hearty, old school, and pure.  I would say my favorite pasty of theirs to date has been their Carne Adovada, but I'm also a fan of about a half dozen other ones too (including a few of their dessert pasties).  In any event, you get the picture.  Good hearty food and beer for a reasonable price in a space that has many personalities.   The Downtown location fits perfectly into the neighborhood, offering a lengthy menu of delicious pasty concoctions sure to appeal to just about anyone.  Happy hour and late night will no doubt be epic here with a mix of Downtown college students, Downtown workers, and Downtown visitors likely filling up all three floors.  It was a cartoonishly long wait for the doors to open.  But Dean and his staff have made certain Pasty's newest location lived up to his dream, making the wait completely worth it.",

It definitely did not disappoint, the space is amazing and every level is different and well done. The second story was full when we got there but we were still able to find a table against the wall for three.  Everyone was BUSY but our server promptly brought menus and waters and beers soon after.  Their beer list is pretty impressive, nicely varied.  But we couldn't wait to get our hands on the food as we'd practically starved ourselves all day in anticipation of this visit.  We ordered the Cornish Meatballs and Garlic Mashed Potatoes with Cheese to start.  The meatballs are wrapped in bacon and covered in sauteed onions then served in a white wine mustard gravy  - every bit as delicious as it sounds.  For the Pasties I had the Chicken Pot Pie for the first time, I've tried a few others and this one is right up there on my list of favorites.  Basically a pot pie filled pasty with a side of rosemary gravy, awesome!  We all had a great time and enjoyed the delicious food and cold beers.  I have been back since and will continue to stuff my face at this location, it is the best!",

There is a bar in the basement so it is easy to get your drink on. And the foot was terrific. I had never been to a Cornish Pasty location, so I tried their Oggi, which is their basic pasty. It was so well done. The crust was just thick enough, the meat and veggies were tender and juicy, and the red wine gravy...wow. You could drink that stuff, it is so good.  Portions are huge. I had to take home half. If you do that, be sure to reheat your food in the oven. It is worth the extra time so it comes out heated through and with a crispy outside.",

I am currently writing this at midnight, and I feel that's why it's important. Dinner service was way over and I know they're open late but it's drinkers. These mashed potatoes were just as good as you'd expect them at 6 at night. It says A LOT out of a kitchen that cares about its last dish as much as it's first dish of service; even if it's just mashed potatoes. Bar staff was great and gave me the laugh I needed, even if it was brief. Always loved the Scottsdale location, but we will definitely be back here, except when my son can actually eat a pasty!",

We sat watching them make the Pasties (a folded pastry case with a savoury filling, typically of seasoned meat and vegetables) and I vowed to come back later during the week. Get the chance right before leaving for the airport and ordered the Pasty we watched them make. Wow, so delish! I ordered the meatball with buffalo mozzarella and basil. Yummy.

It was my birthday and I went as a treat on my 85 yr old next door neighbor. He rarely goes out but I'd mentioned I wanted to check the place out. I had heard it was good. My biggest complaint: with three levels of seating, someone forgot to include handicapped accessible?! My neighbor could neither go up or down stairs and there was hardly any seating on main level. Worst of all, none of the staff seemed to get it. We won't be the first or the last, eventually they will catch on.",

It's much more charming then the Tempe and other East Valley locations we've been to. The food is always delicious--I love the red wine gravy that comes with some of the pasties. The service was really neglectful that night and we were charged twice for one glass of wine that we asked two other servers to bring or find our server. We got it straightened out. They are very nice; just not 'on it' that night.",

Me n my friends had the rudest server though... so I feel compelled to complain. Im a bartender myself and have been working in the service for awhile so I can be a harsh critic but this was just soooo bad.  She clearly didnt want to be there, which I get, dont let your customers see that though. She did the thing where she would quickly stop by to mumble \" can I get you something?\" before any of us could respond shes already walking away.. Slow down girl, damn. We put in chips with our first round of drinks. They took awhile so after not seeing her for 10 min ,and they didnt show I asked her about them. She said they would come with food, okay no problem. Our food gets there with no chips, cool. I ask the gentlemen who dropped our food about them, he checks, our server never put the order in ?! Why didnt she check on em when I asked her the first time? I think I left her 3 bucks on a 70 dollar tab. Im a good tipper too but I actually have to get table service. I feel just taking the order and dropping the drinks doesnt warrant anything close 20%. Guess she didnt want the money. shitty attitude . HOwever ! some dude in a beanie had a clue , he comped the chips we didnt even want anymore and apologized on behalf of the server. Thanks dude ! Whoever you are !",

The problem I have with the Monroe location is that it just seems a little dingy and dark to me--more like a bar than a restaurant.  Also, we've been at least 4 or 5 times and the service ranges from bad to mediocre.  The last visit we ordered a salad and a pasty and they brought both at the same time.  Our waiter said if we wanted our salad first, we should have stated that.  Really?  I'll continue to eat at Cornish Pasty because their food is good, and I'll probably continue to save money on the tip . . .",

That said, in four tries, I've never had a positive experience at the downtown Phoenix location. The first time, my order was incorrect. The second time, it took 20 minutes to be served drinks, and another 45 minutes to be served food. The third time, my order was incorrect again. Today, on my fourth visit for an early lunch, we ordered immediately -- a veggie tikka masala pasty and my usual, the Caesar salad with salmon. My boyfriend also ordered a draught IPA, and we were served at the bar. Our food took more than 50 minutes to arrive, without apology or explanation. It was delicious, as usual, but the kitchen at this location is clearly having a hard time making things work. What's more, for a little day drinking, the beer prices are dumb. $6.40 for a local IPA is pushing it, especially when this location doesn't offer the cheap beer options (Mickey's) that we all know and love from the Tempe location. Really hoping that this place can pull it together.",

I ordered a roast beef sarnie with a horseradish sour cream and a drink. The drink came out right away and the food too a bit of time, but it was well worth it. It was VERY fresh out of the oven and I burned my fingers several times but I kept eating because it was so good.

Ariel was our bartender and was great but the most amazing part . . . I left my phone sitting on the bar and left for the show (I know, I'm a moron). We called 20 minutes later and Ariel had turned it in and the street level bartender offered to personally hold it himself until we returned to pick it up after the show. True to his word, he had it in his pocket when we got there 3 hours later.  We will definitely be back for the drinks, food and especially the service!!",

Very fresh and tasty. The drinks are strong and crafted beautifully. If you are looking for something better than typical Pub Fare then this is your place, it's comfort food in a place where you have three entirely different settings; al fresco, bar and romantic! All in one place. Very hard to find a concept like this and it be enjoyable. Service was great and if I'm ever in the Phoenix area again I am definitely coming back.",

It's an interesting setup; they've got some outdoor seating and you walk in to what seems like a small space. However, they have a basement as well as a second floor, both set up lounge style. They really took a creative spin and I thought it was great. The hostess greeted us and gave us the rundown: we seat ourselves and the server comes by with menus. We chose to sit downstairs and I loved all the booths and private spaces. It was dark in typical CP style but didn't detract.   My friend and I ordered waters and their oven chips as an appetizer. Delicious! They came with complimentary jalapenos and garlic topping and the potatoes were crispy and flavorful with no hint of greasiness. My first choice of pasty was unavailable unfortunately so I went with one I've tried before, the veggie chicken tikka masala. My friend got the veggie Mexican. My order came out wrong and I received the veggie cottage pie instead, and I decided to take it instead of waiting longer for my original order. We split our pasties and I liked the Mexican but not the cottage so much. However, our server was apologetic about the order mixup and didn't charge us for the second pasty.   I do love the buttery flaky crust (props if you get my reference haha) and I learned that the crimped edges means those are the vegetarian pasties. Way cool! Despite the snafu, I will come back to CP. This is a neat location to check out in downtown Phoenix, walking distance from other entertainment venues.",

    "text": "The wait is *finally* over! Cornish Pasty has soft opened their downtown location. And I couldn't be more smitten.   Allen texted me during an especially gruelling day of work announcing this restaurant was opened and invited me to dinner. How could I resist?! When we arrived, the place was bustling and the main floor was packed. So we made our way upstairs to the huge dining area. We were promptly brought waters and menus, and asked about the best appetizers to order. We opted for the chicken liver pate and an order of Scotch egg. The pate was fantastic! The flavors popped and we agreed this was something we would eat with a spoon if no one was watching. I recommend getting the toasted bread with this. The Scotch egg was perfectly cooked and served with a side of honey mustard. It was good enough without the dipping sauce, but it added another layer to the experience.  Now, for what they're known for: the pasties. I ordered the lamb and mint, plus a side of mashed rutabaga because I've never had mashed rutabaga. (Truth be told,  I actually ordered the rutabaga because it was a code word in an episode of Charmed. Gosh, did I really admit that?!?). I love lamb, and this played perfectly into my love of this meat. While the mashed rutabaga was a tab salty, it still had great flavor and together with the pasty made for a filling meal. So much so that I ended up taking half home. I'm thinking lustfully of heating this up for lunch tomorrow.   Service was pleasant and the atmosphere was wonderful! Allen mentioned it would have been great if they had opened when his dad and step mom were in town, but we'll have a destination for them next year when they are back in town. For being their soft opening, everything appeared to go without a hitch, and I can't wait to get back and eat through the menu. I even think there is something my David will find familiar enough to eat.",

    "text": "Located in the heart of downtown, this is a great place for the working person, student, or juror to grab a meal.   This place was pretty packed when my fiance brought us here for lunch. We walked up to the upper level which was dark and had a great pub feel. We took a seat by the windows and waited for a server to come around.   Service: it took a while to get a menu, but once they came, they returned frequently to check up on us and grab the order. Service isn't the fastest here, partially because it's a more casual environment, and partially because the food takes a while to make.   Food: its worth the wait. We ended up getting the Pilgrim after we were told that they were out of the Bangers and Mash. These Cornish pasties are humongous and delicious. We split the one pasty and it was the perfect lunch, but maybe on the lighter side for my fiance. The thing is, they're dense meals, so be prepared to feel heavy if you end up devouring the whole pasty by yourself (which is always so darn tempting). Sharing is recommended.  The Pilgrim was excellent and filled with a savory mix of stuffing, sweet potatoes, and turkey. Covered it gravy and cranberry sauce, it was too good. Hello Fall.   We'll be back!",

The atmosphere was...gothic, maybe? I'm not sure how to describe it. It was darkly lit (mood lighting), with long, heavy wooden tables, wooden pews for seating, ornate black lanterns, etc. Overall, we enjoyed the atmosphere.  As for food, we ordered The Oggie (traditional pasty), which has steak, potatoes, rutabega, and is served with red wine gravy. We shared one and immediately regretted that we didn't order our own. We finished it so quickly because it was that good.  We are giving this restuarant a 4 star because we didn't try any other foods or drinks, so we can't say overall how great this restaurant is.  BOTTOMLINE: we will return and we recommend! (We actually did return the next day and bought another one to go, but we were approached by a homeless man who asked if we had any food. With a metaphorical tear, we gave away our untouched Oggie to someone who needed it more).",

At this point, we were considering leaving.     ...On a whimsy, we went downstairs to check the space out, and it was largely empty.   The server downstairs was rude, stating that it would take 45-60 minutes to get food (so why bother?), and not to order drinks from him but go to the bar instead.

I've always enjoyed meats and savory ingredients stuffed inside pastry dough, and I'm glad I tried my first ever pasty here.  The cool part about this place is the open kitchen concept. Sitting at the bar, enjoying a pint with your pasty and chatting it up with the bartender, you also get to see the pasties being made from start to finish.   The prep and wait time are both worth it (about 25-30 min wait). These things are a meal in themselves and the quality of the ingredients is very fresh. I went with a classic shepherd's pie. Lots of ground lamb, potatoes, peas, carrots and cheese. And the pastry was cooked perfectly. Washed down with a proper pint, you get a satisfying meal.  The only downsides were of no fault to the restaurant itself. A lot of the patrons seemed to be bar hopping as a few drunk girls didn't know what pasties were (pronounced rhyming with \"hasty\" thinking it's the decorative thing you put over your nipples) and asked for really specific mixed drinks, one guy broke a glass by the entrance, and one 40-something Guy Fieri type didn't know \"what are those pastries.\" The music was loud and likely a playlist the cooks put together as I wouldn't think of Metallica and Black Sabbath pairing with pasties, but I give it a pass because they are hard at work and just want hype music.  So, do check this place out for a proper pasty, but don't feel obligated to eat in house. They also ship their products, which is a plus until they open a location in Tucson.",

What is a pasty you say (pronounced Pah-stee, not Pay-stee)?! A pasty is a delightful breaded pocket of deliciousness stuffed to the brim with a whole slew of different fillings--think a baked empanada. The more traditional pasties are chunks of chicken or beef with gravy and carrots, onions etc (think a hearty stew). Cornish Pasty Co has gone where no pasty has gone before and has a huge selection ranging from Mediterranean, Mexican, traditional, vegetarian, and sweet. I live in Tucson, but any time that I make it up to Phoenix this is often my first stop. They make these ultra fresh, so the wait time can be a deterrent for some; luckily you can enjoy a pint or cocktail in a quaint and comfortable setting while you wait. They also sell half baked pasties to take home and finish in your own oven, we end up doing this far to often!   Overall, I think the Cornish Pasty Co has something for every taste and desire. Give them a try and learn some of the cool history behind this delicious pocket of goodness.",

I also ordered the Carmel apple pie pasty which was very good as well, my only complaint is the whipped cream was bland. Like no vanilla flavor, no sugar. It was like eating whipped half and half or fluff with no purpose since so tasteless. My other co workers complained about it too. Portions are big, even with one pasty, you'll have leftovers.   The place just opened across the street from my job. You enter from the street into a bar area to the left and a few tables to right (plus the tables on patio out front). In the middle is stairs going down to a basement level. I didn't go down there, so not sure if it's for workers or open to public. Then there are stairs on both sides of the restaurant going up to another floor with more tables to sit and eat. I really liked the feel and look of the place. It was packed with lots of people.

I'm also a big fan of the vindaloo. They building is has 3 levels, and it open and airier than the Tempe site. Thanks for love.",

When we walked in, the place was packed and, with open seating, we had a difficult time finding a table.  However, once I began eating I totally changed my mind. The roast pasty was delicious. Full of roast beef, vegetables, and gravy in a great tasting pastry. And quite a sizable portion that my wife and I split.  I also had a cup of potato leek soup. It too was very flavorful. The soup was only lukewarm but it tasted so good I ate it anyway. I should have mentioned it to our server but it was St. Patrick's Day and they were so busy. Considering the day and how busy they were the service was excellent. I can't wait to go back!",

It took about 15 min and three different people to confirm there was a vegan pasty available though the menu said there would always be two options and none of the dessert ones we wanted were available. Everyone in our party thought the food was overly salty, including the mushy peas. The service wasn't great, but forgivable since he was brand new and was trying so very hard to please us with a great attitude while being completely lost. I hope they can improve over time. I would try it again maybe after giving them a few more months.",

How embarrassing and sickly of them to do this to us! We were followed for blocks back to our vehicle in a parking garage and the guy proceeded to yell that he was calling the police and that we needed to pay.

The Guiness pasty has much cheesy goodness and some hearty flavor and good presence of rosemary. You can see the staff making fresh pasties front-of-house as you sip a brew on the first floor. Their desserts are all house made and the dark chocolate brandy bread and butter bread pudding is excellent (with the creme anglaise of course!). The banofee pie is great as well.
