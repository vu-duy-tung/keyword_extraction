My friend ordered the truffle bacon burger, and it came with only bacon. I got the Gorgonzola apple salad and it had no bacon, the dressing was watery, and the chicken was undercooked. The service was terrible. There was one server for the whole restaurant and there was a large party so it was ok for it to be slow, but we were literally at the restaurant for an hour and a half. The server was unapologetic and it took him 5 minutes to greet us. We will not be back. Guac was brown and also a disappointment. It tasted like it came from a tub.",

I think they were cooking on a one-burner sterno stove, and then they'd carry out one plate at a time. The French fries were great but everything else was pretty inedible - either way too spicy or no flavor at all. Mac and cheese tasted like velveeta, twice baked potato was just a regular baked potato.  Bathroom smelled awful and whole place smelled like beer. Eau de frathouse.  Wanted to like it but I can't recommend it other than the fries.",

    "text": "This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. Literally the worst. After seeing all the good reviews I am convinced there is an integrity problem with Yelp. If I had not been with a group of friends I would have gotten up and left. It started with them being out of the beers (plural) we wanted to try. Then tried ordering a fruity drink and out of fruit. The food came out at different times and we had to keep asking for our sides and other stuff and get up to find our server. We were the only people in the place. I understand why. The service was so unforgivable we will never be back. My bad review will probably not show up sadly.   UPDATE: The owner or manager did respond to my review very professionally and offered a gift certificate to give them the opportunity to wow us. Unfortunately while I appreciate this appropriate and professional response and do give great credit to them for it and for our server for warning me of the allergy contamination, I am not taking them up on the offer. An additional issue we had was that they fry fish and shrimp in the same oil as everything else including bacon apparently, and cook fish on the burger grill so as a fish allergy sufferer, I was not even able to eat anything. I ordered several things but kept being told they were for one reason or another fish contaminated. I greatly appreciate that the server and cook did inform me. This is the one saving grace in the service. Many restaurants will pan cook something if they do not perform other cross contamination limiting practices. This restaurant won't even pan cook a burger!  Fish/shellfish allergies are so common it is surprising a chef run restaurant would not have a plan in place for pan cooking or a separate fryer for fish. I did not include this in my original review since it is only of consequence to 1 in 25 diners but to further explain why we are declining returning.  This is not an allergy friendly place so not good for groups and my son and spouse who were able to eat (at different times due to service/ kitchen issues) said the food was uninspired, tasted of the fridge and was the worst mushy mac and cheese ever.",

We received a couple more passing snide glances from the hostess as she walked by. Mike the trivia guy was fun and the food ( we ordered appetizers) was decent. The atmosphere was good. Overall, a middle of the road rating. They could do better- maybe start with teaching that rude hostess how to smile and feign interest in customers.",

They do wings and a PITCHER of beer for like $11 (happy hour). The wings are plump- tasty- and I think you get 10 per order. Very worthwhile. Try them dry rubbed with the sauce on the side. They also do a burger, fries, and a PITCHER of beer for $13.50. You really can't beat it. I believe if you just want to drink on happy hour, a pitcher of beer is $5, and one of their signature cocktail is $5 also. They have delicious guacamole and chips (a happy hour thing) and the one thing I have had that isn't on happy hour but is pretty dang tasty is their appetizer board... It comes with sausages, DELICIOUS pretzels with cheese, fingerling potatoes... Yum. But it's like $14. Pricey, but worth the occasional splurge. They also do team trivia one night a week.   The main point to take away from this is to ride your bike in anytime for happy hour- or just go during happy hour. They have ample outdoor seating, but do get pretty packed later in the evening.",

It seemed like they were short on waitstaff, and although my server was friendly, she and the other waiters/waitresses appeared a bit frazzled with all the running around they had to do.

It was a bit of an older crowd, but a youthful place, if that makes sense.  The seating area was nice and updated, tv's everywhere with football on, and nice chill music.  The food is what put us off.  I ordered the ribs.  The smoky smell of bbq when you get close to the place put me in the mood.  But, they slathered so much sauce on the ribs, that's all you could taste.  I also liked the sound of their jalapeno coleslaw listed as a side.  I even commented to the server how much it sounded interesting.  Needless to say, just a plan ol Cole slaw showed up.  No jalapeno, no hint of heat.  My wife ordered their southwest salad.  Chipotle Caesar dressing was listed.  But just plain ol Caesar dressing is what came out.  Again, no hint of spicy.  The main reason we will be coming back... everyone else's food looked great!  It made us regret our choices for that night, but interested enough to give it another shot.",

We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon and we expected it to be a lot more busy than it was.  They have a huge dog friendly patio where you can park your bike while you eat.  The inside feels very cave-like and home-y.  We sat at the bar, which meant that we could take advantage of happy hour food and drink specials even though it wasn't quite time for food specials to go into effect.  The drink specials are some of the best in the valley.  A pitcher that yields at least 2.5 pints for only $5?!  Sign me up.  the red sangria for $5 was amazing too.    My hubby and I both ordered side salads to start.  My only critique is that the salad bowls were so small and so full that I was dumping stuff all over the bar.  The bowls were far too small for the salad in them.  I ordered the Ahi tuna sandwich and cole slaw and my hubby got an Italian sausage Panini with macaroni and cheese.  We both really liked what we ordered.    The bartender was very friendly and attentive.  The music that played in the main restaurant/bar area was so good that my hubby thought they had stolen his iPod!  The whole experience was great.  We now wish we lived close enough to ride our bikes there and get happy hour all day!",

I had the carne asada tacos which were seasoned perfectly and was topped with guacamole and lettuce. They had beans in a warm broth on the side which were great! My sangria was sweet and had fresh fruit. For sure will be back!",

I am pescatarian so i always get their Ahi Tuna burger and it's not only the best in Arizona it's the best Ahi Tuna burger I have ever had and I had many of them all over . The Tuna is always fresh and the pieces of fish are big and nice . It comes with grated ginger inside and aioli which work perfect together ! I never tried their hamburgers but my friends told me they are amazing I had their veggie portobello \"hamburger\" which comes with goat cheese and it was awesome too !   Ps  The ratio of fish and bun is perfect  The service was always good  And I have nice experience working and making fresh fish and if I love it I think I am pretty sure u will. .",

They did appear to be overly busy as we walked through the bar to sit outside. It's not that our food took a crazy amount of time to come out it's that our waitress rarely checked on us. We ordered chips and queso with our drinks before ordering our meals. We were served our drinks but never received our chips and queso. Our meal came out as we ordered it. Yet again we were not checked on by our waitress until I was ready for the check. I'm all about service and unfortunately we just didn't get that here today.",

The menu is pub fare that has been fancied up a bit, but it's basically a bar that has good food. I don't know what the negative reviews are about. I get the idea that some of the negative reviewers are expecting a 3 Michelin star experience for $20.00. It doesn't work that way. A reviewer should have appropriate expectations.

Loved the atmosphere and the size of the place was really big! The service was great too! Very friendly waitress. Decent prices too.  We happened to have come on a night when they were doing a trivia thing and I really wish I woulda known that because I totally would have come on time so that I could play too! It started at 7pm and I got there at almost 8pm so bummer- was too late in the game to start. The people playing though seemed to be regulars and they were having a lot of fun playing. And btw- did ya know that the first male music artist to be featured on the front cover of \"Rolling Stone\" was John Lennon? And the first female was \"Tina Turner?\" Lol   So I ended up getting their deviled eggs which is one of their specialty items, (there's a little bicycle next to these items) and another specialty item was the chicken pozole soup which I also had, and I had a side order of the Mac and cheese. Everything was amazing! So glad I took the opinions of my fellow yelpers haha great place!   My only regret- not coming by earlier so I could play the trivia and hang out longer. Great place overall! Stop in!",

Once we got past the smell, we started to order and they were out of so many things to drink and eat. We decided that we would not stay and told the waitress we were out of here. There are plenty of restaurants and bars around the Phoenix area that are open on Sunday and are clean and well stocked. The place does advertise that if you ride your bike there you get plenty of discounts. Well I suppose that if you ride your bike there in summer you yourself smell bad enough to not smell the odor or the bar.",

Had to go inside to come out the patio so we could lock up our bikes. Do they not expect cyclists to stop in on a Sunday...?  Service was lacking big time. Attempted to order a cherry Coke, was told they don't have that... right... Apparently their bar doesn't stock grenadine, or this waitress was clueless. Thinking the latter. I shook my head and just ordered a Coke. Starting off on the wrong foot already.  Supposed to be all day happy hour if you ride in. Had no problems taking advantage of that on my first visit which was outside regular happy hour. This time, I had to point it out on the menu to the waitress before we ordered food, and this is after we had mentioned that we rode in when she took our drink order. As if us being red and sweaty wasn't indication enough.  Speaking of sweaty, this place is a sweat lodge. Never got below 84 per my phone in the booth we were in. They had a few portable a/c units near the windows, which are of no help unless you're sitting 4 feet away from them.  Spent most of our time just waiting for our order in the hot stuffy dining room. Food and drinks  service was VERY slow.   Could not wait to flee this place for good. Not recommended. Could be good, but service, atmosphere and food is severely lacking. Just head up the street to North Mountain and have a much better time.",

Nothing nada. We sit down to eat and wonder why it's so hot we ask the waitress and she tells us how the air isn't working. Cool wish we would have known that before we walked in...  We order food and I ordered a quesadilla that was smothered in some sort of chipotle sauce like the chef was fucking sauce happy.

I'd like to think it was the product of an amorous relationship between a cow and pig but I'm pretty sure they just cooked the steak on top of where they cooked our sausage appetizer without cleaning the grill.   The calamari tasted like it was the byproduct of an actual spoke and wheel. I assume it was the wheel based on its texture.   Maybe this is my fault. I should know better than to order sea food and a steak at a local watering hole. Please do not make the same assumption that ordering food on the menu will be edible.

    "text": "The husband and I went to Spoke and Wheel last weekend to check out their awesome happy hour! I have been to Timo a few times and liked it very much, so was excited for S & W. We sat at the bar so we had access to their 'bar only' menu of specials. This was cool because they had food specials at the bar prior to having the specials for happy hour in the rest of the restaurant and the specials were slightly different. We got a cheeseburger with fries (7$), guac and house made chips (4$), and wings (7$ I think...). We also had the sangria and beer, which were good and affordable at 5$. The food all sounded good, but none of it was anything terribly spectacular. The burger has house ground meat and house made buns.... sounds great, right? Well, it was good, but it lacked some flavor. I know it was a very simple burger, and their menu has several other burgers on it that look more delicious, but I was a little disappointed with this one (would definitely go back to try one of their 'fancy' burgers though). The garlic fries were delish. The wings were standard wings, good, but just typical. The guac was good, but I wish it was spicy.... the house made chips were nicely done, though, they were thin and crispy. I would definitely give this place another chance, but it just isn't at the top of my list at this moment since nothing really stood out (prices were good though!).",

    "text": "Holy mother of God, I think I've had my worst restaurant experience...ever! Tonight we decided to try out the new Spoke and Wheel restaurant. Their signage and billboards looked promising and my friends and I like to try new places. I almost didn't post this, but the longer I thought about it, the more aggravated I got. For the record...I really, really wanted to like this place.   Here's the rundown of my experience. Upon entering the restaurant I could tell there was something wrong. The parking lot was empty, along with a whole dining room, but there was a 20-minute wait for a table. Now, I may not own a restaurant, but I am pretty sure they make money by turning tables. The first round of drinks took almost 30 minutes to get to us (including water). Secondly, I was not able to order my burger the way I wanted because it was not the half-pound burger. What?! Another almost 30 minutes later our food is dropped off. I say \"dropped off\" because it was literally placed in front of us and that was it. While we ate, we started seeing guys going around the dining room and start taking tables and chairs outside. We watched and watched as they emptied the whole floor leaving the perimeter booths full (and not served) and isolated two tables of customers to the middle of the floor. Awkward! The whole time we watched them clear the floor we were never asked to have our drinks refilled, if our food was OK...nothing. When the server finally came back to the table after we had eaten, I asked what was going on to find out there was a big, reserved party being set up. My experience as a new customer, at a new restaurant, was cut short because they were too busy setting up for other customers? It just seemed to me they would have been better off having the host start seating the totally empty dining room earlier rather than keep filling the one that was going to be used for the party. As it came time to pay our check the slowness worsened. It took as long to pay the check as it did to order and eat our meal! After finally being able to pay I stopped at the front to see if I could get a card to speak to the owner. The owner was there and I explained that I thought it was a bit rude and classless to start emptying a dining room around customers because of improper management planning. It might have been a better idea to have the crew clearing the floor helping the servers getting customers cashed out BEFORE taking all the furniture out. All I got was the standard \"let me make it up to you\" response like I was going to come back. As I looked outside, I saw 4 busloads of 20-somethings in atrocious clothing surging the front door (which was now totally blocked by the crowd). Pretty sure that is a fire hazard. I didn't take the free meal we were going to get on principle alone. They can have their other customers who will accept that sort or service (and I blame for making this kind of thing acceptable) while I go other places more appreciative of my business. Like I wrote on my credit card draft \"I AM NEVER COMING BACK\"!",

I got a regular cheeseburger with sweet potato fries which I think would've been better if it wasn't cold by the time it got to me. Also, the waitress left quickly before I could ask for ketchup and mustard and didn't come back for another 10 minutes... So I had to wait to eat. Who brings a burger without ketchup and mustard? And the deviled eggs were unlike any deviled eggs I'd ever had (not in a good way).... Some kind of weird flavor inside that I didn't like.... And they had capers on them and the oil from the capers made them oily and hard to grip...Maybe it just wasn't my favorite idk what others might think...  And as for the service... I'm hoping that it was just an off day? They did look understaffed and I think my waitress was pregnant so I'll give her a break. Willing to give them another try in the future because the atmosphere is really cool and they seem like they have a pretty good happy hour.",

My girlfriend and I were waiting for almost an hour for our order when the waiter finally tells us he forgot to enter the order in the computer and they never started preparing it. He seemed to be on something if you know what I mean. He offered to put it in with a discount and apologized.  When our food finally came out the crispy chicken sandwich I ordered was pathetic. After the meal I received the check and it was barely even a discount. Not once did the manager check in on us and the discount on the ticket was for an employee meal for around five bucks. I bet management was unaware of anything happening on the dining floor. All though I've  enjoyed meals here in the past I doubt I will ever return after tonight! Poor service, poor food and even worse management! (Well lack of management. ) Hopefully this place gets it together.",

Why this place is five stars for me:  1) Probably the best and most consistent service I've had in Phoenix so far. The waitstaff is very quick to greet you, quick to take orders, and the food is always fast. Never have had to wait for anything.  2) The food that we have tried is incredible. Burgers are the best I've had in Phoenix to date. The mussels, calamari, and salads are great. Great happy hour specials and good beer selection on tap.  3) Atmostphere. Nice sized bar. Clean, up to date. TV's EVERYWHERE. This is a great place to catch a game. I've only been here on week nights, but I've never had to wait for a spot at the bar or a table.",

The food was decent, the staff was friendly, and I had a lovely time!  Let me first say that their Bloody Mary is amazing.  Good flavor, nice heat [although a bit too spicy for me but that's because I'm weaksauce], and what a generous serving.  No skinny collins glasses here!  Anywho, I got the Sonoran dog with the mac and cheese.  What can be said about a deliciously grilled hot dog with bacon, tomatoes, beans, mustard, mayo, and grilled onions?  It hit the spot although my bun completely fell apart about halfway through.  I'm a slow eater and I had great company that kept me distracted and laughing!  The mac and cheese was alright, nothing spectacular to write home about.  I also got to try the chips and guacamole which I apparently forgot to take a picture of.  Oh well!  It's just regular guacamole and chips, y'all.  Nothing fancy.  Would I be back?  I probably would stop by if I were in the area for that Bloody Mary.  Jayzus!",

The parking is easy, in a lot to the south of the restaurant.   Food: The food is OK. I eat mostly vegetarian and have been able to find foods. The tomato soup was surprisingly decent, and the pretzels/cheese are OK. The vegetable side dishes have been tasty though a bit overly oily.   Service: fast and friendly *usually*. However, sometimes it takes forever to get checks.    Events: This particular location has Team Trivia on Saturdays evenings at 6pm.  They do take reservations, and I am often editing the reservations since our group ranges from seven to 15 people at any given Saturday.  The Team Trivia hosts have changed almost every time I attend, but it's easy and free to play.",

I came out on a Tuesday so it wasn't too busy, but it quickly filled up for Trivia Night! We did not sign up but my friend and I participated in the background which was still fun. The annoying part of trivia night was that they would ask the question and then would play a whole song or 2 in between, hence it lasting 2 hours. But this was my first trivia night, so maybe this is quite common.   My friend and I shared two shared plates which was a great idea. We shared the Nachos and the Pig and pretzel plate. The pretzel plate was my favorite! It had lots of variety and plenty of food which I find hard to find when ordering a board like that. It had 2 large sausages, 3 pretzel balls, plenty of cheese, mustard, and 2 ribs. The menu was HUGE and didn't even have the chance to look at it all the other options because I was so hungry.   I would definitely want to check this place out on another night, there were plenty of TVs to watch sports and the booths were super comfy to sit in!!!",

Trust me that this isn't the case and go in! You go slightly down from the entrance into the CUTEST bar. The bartenders are so nice and down to earth. They're very talented with their cocktail creations.   My favorite part was the wine on tap and sweet potato waffle fries.  After I finished my homework there was live music (on a Thursday!) with a guy that sounded similar to Jack Johnson. I had goosebumps. It was so relaxing and I promise that's not just the wine talking. I brought my \"adult\" zen coloring books and didn't even feel judged.   My recommendation would be to get here at the beginning of happy hour as the bartender(s) get busy closer to the heart and end of happy hour.",

He did to keep our beverages filled.There were three of us in our party. We each ordered different items and the food sucked. I had the veggie omelette and it came with toast and potatoes. The omelette was very thick and heavy. The vegetables were simply mixed into the egg and whipped together and put in the skillet and cooked and then folded over. It was not an omelet. The toast was served dry, no butter no jam, none offered. We had to wait for our silverware after I food arrived. The potatoes were cooked with hot peppers which I don't care for. Another ordered the veggie tacos which she would not order again. The third person in our party ordered meat tacos and would not order those again. I'm pretty certain that none of us will be returning.",

He said the cigar could be smelled from inside the building and had to move to the farthest end of the patio. I asked who he was and then at thst point he identified himself by name and indicated that he is the general manager. My background includes managing and owning a restaurant so it became a  teachable moment.  I gave him a polite dressing down as to how to address a situation like this in the future by introducing himself first by name and title before asking for action to be taken.  I was beyond the legal distance from a door for smoking and no posting was present with regards to the patio smoking policy. Perhaps a small investment in a sign for the patio may save him in future embarrasment.",

Drinks are watered down for sure.  Update- went back thinking \"maybe someone had called in that night and they were doing the best they can\" and regretted it a second time.

They advertise two over easy eggs because there really isn't a lot of gravy involved.  The eggs yolk would have made this dish.  Fried chicken layered in was not very browned...you want a nice crunch even if you know it may come out soft mixed in a dish like this.  I probably wouldn't order this again.

    "text": "Great patio, but they need a stout on the beer menu and the kitchen needs to learn how to cook and season food.  We ordered a pitcher of beer, it was cold with chilled glasses!  It was happy hour so we ordered the sonoran hot dog and the jalapeno poppers.  The hot dog and fries were good, but not hot (temperature).  The poppers were barely grilled, like eating a raw jalapeno.  Very HOT!! We couldn't get anyone's attention, so went to the bar to get water.  The waitress had the poppers taken off the bill and we ordered calamari.  It didn't have the golden color that make it appealing and it was VERY greasy, plus it didn't have any seasoning.  A little salt and pepper go a long way.  Like we said the manager took the poppers off our bill, but we didn't have the heart to send the calamari back too.  Bottom line; nice place we will stop for a beverage, but the food will keep us heading up the street!",

Had the Deviled Eggs, Chicken Chirizo Nachos, Grilled Calamari. Excellent and very delicious.  Their prices are very good and the food very fresh and tasty.  Love what they did to the decor.  Very open and inviting. The Bar Tender Brian was excellent. Great service.  So glad they are close to where I live.  Another great place to go in the neighborhood.  Cant wait to go back and try their burgers and sandwiches and more.  A big thumbs up!!  If you havent been you must go. Definately recommend. :)",

The restaurant looks nicely redone, paint, flooring and lighting are comfortable and fitting for a tavern.  That unfortunately, is the high point of our visit.  The staff is not well trained or coordinating well with each other or the kitchen. Several tables around us were having difficulties with incorrect orders and poorly prepared food.  My husband wanted the Pale Ale, Lagunitas, however they were out.  The restaurant only opened the day before. I ordered a salad and sweet potato fries, the fries were forgotten. When the fries did arrive they were hot, crisp and delicious.  The salad was over dressed.  My husband ordered the green chili chicken wrap, it was good.  We hope they work out the kinks and take the time to train the staff from the hostess to the waiters.  This place  looks like it has potential we hope they smooth things out.",

    "text": "It seems like every restaurant and bar concept has been tried at this location but nothing has ever stuck for one reason or another.  This building has been several different bars, several different restaurants, and most recently a Dillon's BBQ restaurant.  Will the newest concept stick?  Well, if it does, they'll need to improve on the quality of the food in my opinion.  My brother and I came here by chance while driving north on Central Avenue.  The place bumps right up against the canal midway between Northern and Dunlap.  The namesake is very much geared toward the many bikers and runners who traverse the historic Murphy Bridle Path from Bethany Home road to where the Path ends right here.  They even give discounts to folks to ride their bike here instead of their cars.  Great way to get patrons in the door.  The interior is pretty roomy (bordering on cavernous) with booths against the wall, a bar, and tables in the middle.  The patio in the back is right up against the canal on one side and Central Ave on the other.  There were flat screen TVs at every booth tuned to football so we went with a booth.  None of the main entrees appealed to me at the time so I actually went with the sausage and soft pretzel platter.  I love sausage and I love pretzels, so why not.  It was served with two different Schreiner's sausages, two small pretzel rolls, a cheese dip and potatoes.  The sausages were very good, though I was disappointed with the portion sizes.  The platter is meant to serve two but I easily took the sausages myself as the portion size was relatively small.  The potatoes I got with the platter were also super dry and tasted like they'd been stuck under a heat lamp for awhile.  The cheese dip was pretty good and was a decent compliment to the pretzel rolls, but not necessarily the sausages.  Overall, the place was sort of meh.  The food was acceptable, but didn't wow me.  The vibe of the restaurant didn't excite me, though this place would work very well as a place to watch the NFL on Sundays with all the TVs they have in there.  And I like the concept of catering to the neighborhood bridle path crowd.  But if my dish was any indication of the rest of their menu, they should focus their improvement efforts on the food.",

My friend exclaimed that we sounded like a bunch of hillbillies who had never been to a restaurant before. It was just so good. The mac & cheese was the best thing I've ever put into my mouth. It was like one big food orgy. It wasn't pretty, but I wasn't on a date ... and if I were, well, I wouldn't change a thing. I would still be moaning with delight and shoving food in my mouth until it was time to go home. Oh, I'm sorry, were we supposed to have a conversation?",

The street tacos are super flavorful and you can mix and match your filling:  chicken chorizo, fish, veggies, and one other choice.  The side beans are good too.  Everything I've ever ordered is high end with good rich flavors.  I also appreciate the deep booths, outdoor seating, bloody mary bar, mussels, guacamole, and menu variety.

The ambiance was nice & that's where it ends pretty much. This was a Sunday. around 6 p.m. & there were 2 servers for the entire place (incl patio)  so the service was lacking to put it mildly. The what appeared to be the manager was bussing & taking drink orders, refills & he got mine wrong. I ordered a cocktail & got a beer that sounded like the cocktail I ordered. Major bummer but I like beer so I sucked it up. The burger we tried was mediocre but was cooked properly. Needed seasoning & the garlic truffle fries were just greasy & shoe string cut. Which is good for me on the cut but not the hubs fave. We tried an app as well but it escapes me what it was now (been a few weeks) but that tells ya something. I can't remember it must have been lacking. So disappointed that we can't give it a second try. Usually if we are into the concept or idea of place we give it another try. Because every single restaurant in town can have an off weekend with a chef or server or barkeep calling in sick. But this was just more bads than good unfortunately.",

    "text": "Great little neighborhood hangout in North Central Phoenix. The food is good, the service is friendly - although not always that fast - and the selection of beer, wine, and cocktails will keep you going. They have a nice large patio for when the weather is nice and plenty of room inside. The parking lot seems a little wonky, but considering its called Spoke & Wheel, you are really encouraged to ride your bike. All in all, this is a nice little place in the center of town.",

    "text": "Wild Thyme Restaurants never ever dissapoint me with food. With that being said I can tell Spoke and Wheel will be just as phenomenal as Brick and Timo (I have not been to Ken's Creekside.) The new ambience is SO much better than Dillons BBQ and the music fits the theme perfectly :-) we had the Mushroom Burger (no meat) which is super phenomenal. My son got the mac & cheese with fries, the mac and cheese was really good too! The homemade Guacamole is to die for. For opening just Monday this place was rockin and busy, I have no doubts that it will thoroughly please the neighborhood as much as Timo and Brick (and I'm sure Ken's Creekside as well ;-) ) Keep up the good work guys  I posted a picture of the Mushrrom Burger and deviled eggs",

    "text": "We had some time to kill between the last of the hotel swaps and my son was craving chicken fingers... again.     I was actually pleasantly surprised by this place as it had a very deliberate theme: bike rack just inside, music from screamo to more classic rock type, and minimal lighting (the most light coming from a glass door).     The food was nothing totally outstanding, but no issues is something I can get behind! I'd rather my stomach filled with nice food than be delayed by mistakes.     If I was a local, this restaurant would almost certainly convince me to get out on my bike more often and I can envision myself coming here with a group of friends for a consistent casual.",

I don't eat meat or milk products and I really appreciate and like restaurants that honor people choices of lifestyle. This is a regular food restaurant but our waiter and kitchen staff went on and beyond to accommodate my needs. I do have allergies and my food was prepared and served accordingly. Which I m greatly appreciate!  It is a very nice place with lots of room inside and also have outside seating.  I ordered fish and veggie street tacos and our server made sure that any parts of sides or souse was milk free or was substitute for milk free one.  Tacos was very delicious and feeling. White sangria was tasty and booze and as of happy hour was only 5$.  Paid with card and as a surprise got 5% back from Groupon.  Would definitely go back and will recommend.",

    "text": "Let me start this review by mentioning that I absolutely never write reviews.  This place is pathetic!  My wife and I used to come here regularly as it is walking distance to from our house.  We quite going because we had a few cases in a row of incredibly horrible service.  Fast forward a year and we thought we would give it another try.  We were sat immediately after walking in.  Then that was where the service stopped... literally we sat for 20 minutes without a single person coming by to say anything to us much less get a drink ordered.  I went to tell the hostess and ask for the manager.  At first she tried to lie and say there was no manager and then when I told her that was not likely she went to get one.  I waited for another 5 mins for the manager to come out.  When he did he carried a tray of food past me.  I asked as he passed if he was the manager and acknowledged he was and continued right past me with out a care in the world.  My wife and I walked out. (I did leave the hostess and a server that was standing there with some choice words as we left.  Bottom line is that I will NEVER go here again.  Its ridiculous that a manager has zero care about the service that goes on in his restaurant... maybe this is why the servers are so bad also.  Poor example of leadership!",

Perfect setting for brunches and dinners -- whether it's with a date or a group. Caitlyn was my server and all I can say is she really knew her stuff! She greeted me right away with a smile, knew the menu and suggested some cold beers off the tap and mentioned the canned beer of the month and some great starter foods off the menu. The carnitas tacos are banging and you should seriously try the nachos, you wont be disappointed! The atmosphere is really chill and laid back with a dog friendly patio. Thats definitely a plus for me and my three dogs, Wes, Molly and Chata!  The restaurant is located right off of Central, great location for a pre or post meal walk especially since the canal is right there! And Happy Hour all day if you ride your bike in!!!  Spoke N Wheel is an awesome tavern and I can't wait to come back again with my wife and bring our newborn baby, Brody and three pups!  Thanks for being my new favorite neighborhood bar!!",

It's our absolute favorite neighborhood spot, for a few different reasons. The food is tasty, super consistent, and always comes out nice and hot (unless you get the chilled shrimp, which is my go-to on happy hour). They serve our favorite beer - San Tan Epicenter which is actually hard to find on draft! Anything from burgers, to the Sonoran dog, to their awesome deviled egg apps are just so great.  We usually see Ryan there, or on the rare nights that Eden is serving and not behind the bar, we are always so happy to have them as our servers. These two seriously just hit it out of the park with their personable, friendly and overall fantastic service.   The patio is THE BEST, with a variety of seating from raised booths to lounge-level couches and Adirondack chairs/coffee tables. This is perfect if you bring your pup, or like us, ride your bikes in for all-day happy hour and enjoy the beautiful AZ weather.   We still have yet to participate in the Trivia nights on Tuesdays and Saturdays, but have sat and enjoyed our dinner/observed the fun. While it's a full house on these nights, it's such a chill crowd and great for date night or families.   Big props to the S&W staff--we LOVE you guys!",

They have a good selection of drinks, I personally love the white sangria. The first time I ate here I ordered the nachos as my entree. They tasted great but I was more impressed by the portion, I couldn't finish it by myself. The second time we went, I ordered the chicken, biscuits & gravy. I don't think I will get a chance to try any other dishes because this dish blew me away! It was seriously delicious. Everything on the plate was on point. The chicken was so juicy & flavorful (says alot because I prefer beef to chicken usually) the biscuits & gravy were rich & satisfying. To top the already sinful meal, it came with a side of mac & cheese! I often think about it & when I can go back just to eat it all again.",

    "text": "I am adding an update. I went here again last night (okay, I might be an addict).  Yes, as always we rode our bikes along the canal to get here and hitched them up at the bike rack (yes, you have to love a restaurant with a bike rack inside).  We chose spoke and wheel for two reasons: (1) They have a bunch of TV's and we wanted to watch some sports in comfortable booths, and (2) We love their hot dogs and my buddy Dave and I wanted to do a \"dog throwdown.\"  This is the place to do it.  Their sonoran dogs are amazing.  Whooops, I forgot, there is a #3 reason - you get 1/2 off pricing if you ride your bike.   I think most of us are now familiar with the amazing \"Attorney Steve Dog\" (no it's not on the menu and you might get some funny looks if you try to order it) which is a sonoran dog with an impressive mixture of nacho cheese and jalapeno - with a side of bacon to boot.  I know, your mouth is watering right?  Well my buddy Dave has been going on and on about \"Dave's Dog\" which he claims is the best sonoran hot dog in the world, (okay, at least the best dog on Central Avenue in Phoenix....hahahah I had to take him up on that).  Anyway, his dog has nacho cheese, mac & cheese and buffalo sauce on it.  I know, that is a pretty mouth-watering concept and a formidable competitor to the Attorney Steve Dog for sure, so we had to know who's was best.  We decided to conduct a sonoran dog throwdown and ordered a couple Dawgs for some other great folks at the bar (it was a birthday party).  The waitress Jennifer (awesome gal, best we have had) brought the Dave's Dog and the Attorney Steve dog over to the table of guests who were kind enough to help us resolve this pending challenge.  There was a lot of chewing going on, and a lot of back and forth raised eyebrows.   There was also a LOT OF FUN.....which is why we love this place.    If you want to know who the sonoran dog throwdown you will have to watch this video.  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F75118756&s=a1054e9f64f44df5b751e7242fb6f135005828f6d20a3c415848d8bef9e3f8d3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">vimeo.com/75118756</a>  As usual, this was yet another great time at the spoke and wheel.  Jason, the manager is also an awesome dude, and he came out to say hi and to make sure everyone was enjoying their meal adding a real nice touch to the evening.  What kind of sonoran dog can you create at the spoke and wheel?   Keep us posted!  - Attorney Steve -",

Great service and food. My personal favorite was the banana stuffed churro. To die for!!! This was a great find on Yelp, since I am not from here and not too familiar with the area!",

    "text": "Such a great location, wonderful ambiance and great idea! The reason for only two stars... Below average  food and cocktails.   I rode my bike here with a friend on a Friday afternoon. The outside patio is wonderful and the inside restaurant is pretty and clean and trendy. The special for bicyclists is all day happy hour. Which is discounts on a couple appetizers and drinks.  We started with two cocktails, queso dip and mussels. The Paloma margarita type cocktail was great, the citrusy cocktail with vodka that I ordered reminded me of college when we attempted to make drinks as sweet and sugary a possible so we couldn't taste the booze. I was told it was supposed to be sweet, but quickly exchanged it for a glass of Chardonnay. The food came out and the chips in my queso dip were stale as for the cheese it was electric orange in color and appeared to be poured from a can. Similar to baseball game nacho cheese. Unimpressive. The mussels were apparently tasty but tough in texture, although I didn't try them.   A couple drinks later with more people joining us we attempted a couple more items. Parmesan fries which were undercooked and mushy, but flavorful. Cauliflower mash which was tasteless. And a salad which was just okay. The winner of the night was the burger which was wonderful.   This restaurant is so close to being good. They have so many great things going for them. Their major hang up is mediocre food. Id be back for more happy hour beer and wine but I would be afraid to eat here again until they got they menu right.",

Food was good once you got it.  Our server was great and manager, once he appeared, appropriately apologetic.  Comped a meal and gave us a dessert.  I want them to be successful so we will certainly give them another chance.  So we went the next night with other friends.  Like I said, we really want this restaurant to be successful.  Service was somewhat better, course we had the attention of the manager.  Still got some things to work out...its slow and forgetful.  The food is quite good.  We sat on the patio which is great.  As we were leaving about 8:30 - 3 bus loads of ASU college students were arriving.  OMG!.  They are not prepared for that kind of crowd yet.  I'm sure they had a good time anyway.  I'm upgrading my rating to 4stars.  I've been there 5 times and each time service gets better and better.  Food is always very good. My husband had a pork chop that was heaven on earth.  It's not on the menu any more but ask.  Drinks are now coming quickly and they haven't forgotten anything (ok except for the apples on the apple Gorgonzola salad which was more hysterical than anything) in the last 2 visits.  We live a hop, skip and a jump away so it's becoming \"our place\".   Give it a try.",

We arrived super stoned and it still didn't taste good. I ordered the Mediterranean pasta. It tasted like a $7 pasta but was priced at almost $13. My man ordered the magic mushroom burger which smelt like dirty boy socks and tasted average. We got Mac n cheese as a side and that was pretty good (velveeta-like taste though), but I could probably make my own version 10x better for the same cost. It had the little crispy topping to it which was a nice touch. Towards the end of our meal we ordered the $7-8 chocolate cake to-go. No one can mess up chocolate cake though... I hope.....",

For example: Incredibly skimpy servings for very hi prices! Wine pours are the smallest you have ever seen at any establishment, and at $9. a glass. We ordered guac & chips and could not believe the small anount oif chips in the bowl. Cmon, how can you skimp on chips? Another person at the table also ordered it, and again it came out with a few chips scattered on the bottom. The guac tasted really odd, and when I looked, I saw it had a lot of goat cheese on top. Yuk!   Thankfully, our waitress brought me out some guac with no cheese. She said she was sympathetic because she was a vegan. I left her a good tip - I hope she got it! There were plenty of servers, but the food took forever to come out, our fries came out COLD and mushy and tasteless.   And, one person ordered a \"bottle of beer\". She was given a glass of beer that was completely FLAT! Not one bubble! It must have been sitting on the counter for hours to be that flat! When she asked the server why she did not get the bottle she ordered, he said: \"we don't serve in a bottle, we pour it into a glass for you\". Did not ask if she wanted a bottle, or ask \"how is it\". Let's insult the customers' intelligence in additon to insulting their taste buds! DO NOT go there, let them go out of business, ASAP!",

Friend #1 had the spicy chicken sandwich with sweet potato waffle fries and she raved about it. The portions were very large, easy to split with another person. Friend #2 had the fish street tacos and was just as pleased as me.   Great place, they're having a Halloween party we're now going to attend.  The only downside was the service. The waitress was nice, knowledgeable and did her best. But she was the only server for the bar, patio and dining room. Not at all her fault and she did her very best.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went to Spoke & Wheel for lunch after a bike ride, the day after it officially opened. We were greeted and seated immediately at one of the curved seating booths. We decided on the outdoor patio seating instead. The patio was covered, had lights, and we could see misters set up. There was also a fire pit. The smoking area was set far back on the northernmost part of the patio. There were no smokers so we don't know if that would have affected our outdoor dining experience. We were served by Rachel who made some beer suggestions and took our drink orders. I had the vanilla pomegranate, a virgin cocktail of pomegranate juice, vanilla, and lemon. My bf ordered a Sleepy Dog Irish Ale because Lagunitas wasn't available. Both drinks were excellent. For lunch we decided to try a 1/4 lb burger (the \"smash burger,\" not to be confused with the 1/2 lb \"phat burger\"). They grind their own meat on site and cook it to your desired doneness. We both preferred medium rare for our burgers, and they were cooked just right. The seasoning we both selected was the Black Truffle burger, which had truffle oil, bacon, and port wine seasoning. Phenomenal. Our sides were the cactus salad (another great suggestion by Rachel), and waffle cut sweet potato fries. We couldn't finish everything but we were extremely happy with our lunch experience at Spoke & Wheel. For only being open for two days we were pretty impressed. We would have liked a stronger bike theme (a few random cruiser bicycles were scattered for bike theme decor) and for the owner to actually subscribe to Pandora (ads in between songs??). Beer selection was decent - while choices were limited, they were good quality beers. The menu had some great appetizer choices as well as a broad selection of side orders. We love that it's right off of the Arizona Canal so accessibility is great for a beer after a bike ride, though we didn't recall seeing a bike rack outside. We will definitely be coming back here to try some of the other menu items, and we will definitely recommend it to friends.",

We rode here with a group from Rio Vista park and were thrilled to find the outdoor patio with lots of bike parking and a waiter who kept the water pitcher full! The burger was great as was all of the other food. This is an awesome biking destination. My only real complaint was that the misters outside were a little overambitious- all of the food at the table was wet within a minute or two.",

S&W offers up a great place to stool up and watch a game on their many connected TV's.  Sports fan fantasy.   What is a game without a Hot Dog - Sonoran Hot Dog to be exact.   I got mine with a side of Kale - yep, that healthy leafy green that is all the rage of 2013 is offed as a side.  Delicious!  Bar aside, the Restaurant is lined with huge booths around the parameter and the outdoor patio is HUGE.  Perfect for the midsummer nights.  In addition to the Sonoran Hot Dog and Kale - I got a side of wings...  Dry Rub, crispy on the outside juicy on the inside wings and they may go down as my favorite secret wing spot.  I don't like over sauced wings!  Add a huge range of beers on Tap and this Baseball dude is in the sweet spot.  Check out the Spoke and wheel...  ...  they also offer a discount to those who ride a bike.  Pedal out!",

One waitress, Rachel was right there when we sat down.  Ordered drinks and she was in no hurry to take order (nice). $5 for a pint of draft or $7.50 for pitcher (mini, 2.5 pints) better deal. Ordered Cheeseburger with garlic fries, medium. Soup steak and onion. Also side of sweet potato fries.   .  Meal was on table in about 10 mins.  Cheese burger with chipotle mayo sauce was outstanding, done just right with a fresh bun (Sunday nite) and as ordered medium. Garlic fries,  lots and good. Now the bad news. Sweet potato cottage fries were over cooked. Soup was OK, nothing special.  Told Rachel she  said sorry but nothing else offered, like new order or no charge. Total bill $40.00 without tip. Nice place but this location has a habit of losing restaurants. 3 in the last several years. Calico Cow, Dillons and now this. If you want the locals your going to have to go the extra mile which they didn't.  First and last time.",

We took my mother-in-law who we don't see very often, and ended up feeling embarrassed.  We had 10:30 reservations, and while it says \"Free Mimosa for Mom\" on arrival, our wasn't even offered a drink.  Our waitress took one drink order right away while the rest of us looked over the cocktail menu, and when she came back about 15 minutes later only brought that drink and one water, the other three of us were left until she made it back another 15 minutes later with waters.  At least give us a glass of water to sip while we wait for the bar orders.  Needless to say now.... but we waited about an hour and 15 minutes for our brunch order, and mine was served to me cold (eggs benedict).  Besides being cold, the eggs were overcooked, and there was barely a spoonful of hollandaise sauce.  I didn't ask the others at the table how theirs was, because it was just to horrible, I didn't want to focus on it.    For happy hour, it's great.  There are good beer choices and you can't go wrong with a burger and fries.  But, please don't go for a special occasion, no matter how enticing their plans seem.  It wasn't worth it.  :(",

The decor was rustic and cycle themed of course. Our server had personality, the drinks had the right amount of alcohol and the HH food tasty. We got there before the Friday dinner rush. But as I looked around, I figured somewhere so off the beaten path, full of people could not be all bad.  It's hard to see right off the road (at least it was for me, I'm blind somwtimes). I've got to come back here and try the rest of the cocktail drinks and some more things on their menu and maybe I'll even get a bike or something.",

The rest of our experience was just average. Once the rest of our party arrived we moved to a table and our service went downhill. Several times it was faster to go back to the bar and order, mind you our table was still in the bar area she just wasn't  as quick. Restaurant and bar are nice, I will give them that. Restrooms outdated and only 2 stalls in women's making a short line form later in the evening. Patio for outside dining. We ordered 10 wings, buffalo style. Food delivered quickly but these were frozen baked wings. The kind I buy at Costco.  Beers, expensive. $5 for a can, yep a can of Modelo. Be prepared to spend cash, for the wings and 4 Modelos and 4 Mich Ultras with tip it was just shy $100. At our normal happy hour spot we would have spent half that.",

When we got here i was a little thrown off cause the outside isn't so drawing to the eye. However, upon entering i was very impressed by the atmosphere. We were seated right away and a waitress introduced herself within a minute of us sitting. The atmosphere is relatively dim and intimidate. Full bar with plenty of tvs and room for bigger parties. There's a patio as well that looked pretty large.  The menu was short and simple. Three pages. Drinks, lunch, and dinner. I had the green chili burger with sweet potato fries and it was very very good. Me and my roommate also had a drink. We came during happy hour so i had a pitcher of dales pale ale for $7. The food came out fast and our waitress was attentive but not over bearing. We checked out in a timely manner and also took advantage of the 10% the check promo without hassle.   Overall the place is great and i have already made plans with another friend of mine to come with. The one critique i have maybe is the pricing on the burgers. They were delicious, but close to $15 for a burger and fries threw me a bit. Nevertheless, I'm still coming back. Great job Spoke & Wheel!",

    "text": "Me and my boyfriend went here for the first time Tuesday night, and it was really good. They were having trivia night so it was pretty busy but everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. We started out with chips and salsa, the chips were warm and the red salsa was good. However the cup the salsa came in was only half full so we ran out of salsa by the time we got through only half the chips. I got their Mediterranean Pasta, and I have to say it is one of the best pasta dishes I've ever tried. My boyfriend got the Philly cheesesteak, he said it was good however he said he thought it was a little dry and not cheesy enough for being a Philly cheesesteak, but the flavor was still good. Our server was super sweet and did a good job on making sure our drinks were full. Overall the experience was good and I want to go back to try their chicken and biscuits",

A little pricey @ $6.95 for the portion, but they're not using crappy gristly meat like you find in soup too often, and the flavor was great. My green chile burger was insane good, cooked just medium rare (YAY) and HUGE.   Service, meh. It was a very slow late Sat. afternoon, 2:30-ish, no big crowds, but took a long time, and then the order was wrong. So we waited some more--lucky we had that yummy soup!   Half way thru the meal, and a hazard of course of being outside, a big honeybee landed on Mom's salad. Hmmmmmmmmm. So we pushed the salad aside after trying to swat if off. The server just said OMG and took the plate. Am I wrong in thinking well, maybe get us a half serving or something, or offer a free dessert?   There seemed to be a LOT of servers for such a quiet time, but it didn't improve the service. Oh well.   That said, I'll go back--lovely sitting outside, and there were some damn fine looking options on the menu that I'd love to try.",

The atmosphere is very comfortable, with booths along the tables, a nice bar with comfy stools/ chairs and an eclectic mix of music that is not so loud that you can't talk.  The bartenders have all been very friendly and helpful. Brian stands out as a great guy and bartender. The entire staff has always been very accommodating and friendly.  The food......  The food.....    So good!  The burgers are delicious and cooked the way you ask. Lots of diff styles of burgers. My fav is the green chile burger. Garlic/ parm cheese fries to die for. They also do mussels in a white wine, tomato  and herbs broth that is incredible!!  My partner in crime has had a few of the salads and raves about the Apple, Gorgonzola salad.   I hope business picks up for them. I would hate to see them disappear. It would be a big loss for the area. And me!!!",

Ride your bike here for happy hour all day! I like that they have small pitchers of beer; its just the right amount for two people (if you just want a beer each) or one person (if you want a couple beers for yourself) There are small tvs on the walls behind the booths; not the greatest to watch a game but ok if don't care about the game and are more focused on food.   Just about everything I've had here has been good. The pretzel and sausage plate is a really good app. The crispy chicken sandwich and chicken and biscuits are my favorite. The burger was, surprisingly, just okay.",

    "text": "Today was the second time I've visited this restaurant. Just like the first time, the wait staff greeted us like a bad smell. Unlike the first time, however, the service did not improve. My friend saw a sign that said seat yourselves, so we did. And there we waited for about 10 minutes at a dirty table while not a single solitary employee came by to bus the table. After they did, we ordered food. Two of the items we requested were sold out, which we were informed of after we placed the order (and waited a fairly long time). When our food arrived via someone other than our waitress, we were asked if there was anything else we needed. Yes. Silverware. The not-our-waitress never returned and 5-10 minutes later our waitress did arrive. I requested silverware. She was gone for at least another 2 minutes (luckily my lunch date was a great conversationalist) but as we sat there with the breeze blowing across the patio, of course our food got cold. I didn't dare send it back and ask that it be re-heated. (We've all heard the many horror stories, and if the staff can't even mask their ill will toward their patrons, I wouldn't risk have my food mishandled in any way.) So, I ate my $15 lunch, cold. Also, when the waitress did procure the silverware, she mentioned that probably the reason the other wait staff never returned with it is because the kitchen didn't have any. Overall, the atmosphere was disorganized, unprofessional, frankly a joke. Although the food had good flavor, we probably will not return. To our waitress's credit, aside from not knowing which dishes were sold out, not noticing beforehand that we lacked silverware, she was more courteous and professional than the 3-4 other employees who interacted with us.",

    "text": "My husband and i have wanted to come here for a while... Im sad that our experience was so \"meh\".   The place had a couple tables, maybe 6 and a few people at the bar. We sat at a table along the wall looking towards the bar. I thought the TVs were kind of awkwardly placed.... I couldn't really see the ones on the opposite side, and i was sitting under the ones closes to me. I made it work. Our server came over for a drink order, he barely said hello, kinda making us feel like we were inconveniencing him. Drinks were just ok. My husband ordered a margarita, he said it was ok. The issue i have with that was, he ordered it with out salt, as he does EVERY time. Our server brought it out with salt on it and when he spoke up about it, the server looked at his book and snatched the glass off the table. All they did was wipe the salt off with a bar napkin, pushing all the salt to the bottom and dumped it into a new glass,  so basically he had a margarita mixed with salt. All my drink was, was syrup. We moved on. The plan was to have a big enough meal that we would not eat dinner (it was like 3) and watch some football. We started off with the wings, since it was our first time there we wanted to try a couple flavors. When we ordered half chipotle bbq and half sweet buffalo, our server said \"yeah, i'll see if they'll do that\".... As if was difficult for the kitchen, I've never heard of a sports-type bar declining that request. The description of the wings was definitely better than the actual flavor... we still ate them. My husband also ordered the guacamole and chips, that was terrible. Tasted like that fake, store bought holy guacamole. We decided to not have dinner. Neither of us were really excited about anything on the menu, since our appetizers fell flat.   We may come back... its not close enough for us to really go out of our way though.",

She was extremely knowledgeable and extremely personable. Keep up the great work Kaitlin!  Try they tacos all of them are great! (The fish tacos are a little bland but still pretty good!) The Sangria was also really delicious... Very fresh!  I also like what they have done with the inside... Still a little gloomy and dark inside but not to shabby on the new decor. The patio is great and could use some decoration love or maybe some cool plants but still has amazing potential!

    "text": "Our group comes here regularly because it is very close to where we meet and has a great atmosphere, good food with really good drinks/specials. We have been there maybe 50+ times. I have never heard anyone complain about the food. However, I would not recommend ordering the nachos if you're in a large group. It seems like they were one of the first dishes made and sat there, getting soggy until the rest of the food was done. The bits that were not soggy were tasty, so I'd say that they would be good if you were in a smaller group of 1-5 people maybe. We usually have 6+ people, and that means we often have a longer wait than usual. It's worth noting. None of us are in too much of a hurry, so that will not affect my review. Recently, they changed the fries from the thin, natural cut style to the stereotypical bar fries that are thick and battered and obviously came out of the freezer. Fries are just too important to me to let that slide. :} If that were not the case, I'd probably rate this place a 5.  2018 update: our group frequents this place less and less often. Their waits are getting pretty long and it's getting harder for me to defend them. Add to that, they play exclusively country music now. I wouldn't say that's usually a deal-breaker, it certainly is not a positive",

The exterior is unassuming, but the space inside is clean and spacious.  I like the menu.  Sure, they're $9, but they do have Sonoran Dogs (comes with a side).  Not sure how authentic they are.  They have a fair selection of burgers and sandwiches.  I went with the black truffle burger, which was tasty, and possibly one of the best burgers I have had in Phoenix.  The parmesan garlic fries are excellent as well.    I also really liked how they had several specialty sodas.  I had the ginger hibiscus soda, but I would like to try them all.  I wish more restaurants offered something better than water or crappy fountain drinks for those who want something non-alcoholic.  And all day happy hour if you come on your bicycle?  I don't even ride, but that's pretty awesome.  Spoke & Wheel has good food, and it's a nice, relaxed place to hang out.  Another excellent spot in the North Central neighborhood.",

Being that my friend is Salvadoran and I am Cuban we don't take race into a factor when it comes to your profession. By the way if the owner were there he  would have noticed that before he tried to discredit my review.  The food was terrible my opinion if you as a reviewer want to spend your money to find that out go for it or read the other reviews. Trust..   Like I said if you can't even wipe clean bathroom walls from a review from 5 months ago..

This is definitely my vote for Bar Rescue Phoenix edition.  Service was weak for starters. Our server / bartender was more concerned with texting and social media then customer service. In fact the chef was more attentive and helpful. On your phone behind the bar is very unprofessional especially when you have customers waiting.  The food is waaaaay overpriced! Nothing under 15$ for lunch or dinner entrees. Salsa from a jar.. (they make sure to charge for even a small side of salsa from that expensive jar salsa also) Stale tortilla chips and microwaved queso. Street corn was ok. Fish and chips basically pre breaded boxed and bagged French fries.  Beer selection is basic so no complaints there but nothing really unique either.  Pricing is ok I wouldn't say competitive but not overly exaggerated.  Also the bars sewage or grease trap perfumed most of bar and restaurant area.  A previous reviewer had pictures of barf chunks all over the wall in the men's restroom.. Its still there 5 MONTHS LATER!!!",

I definitely recommend sitting outside if you can!  I ordered the veggie tacos. Our waiter made sure to clarify with me that the beans had animal product and let me switch out for cole slaw. I always appreciate extra consideration like that from servers. Pricing is super reasonable and the food was great. Oh, and get a Bloody Mary if you go around brunch! Tbh, the one I had was one of the best I've had in the valley (and that's saying something because I, like, love brunch).  I have absolutely nothing negative to say. Good food, good service, reasonable pricing. The restaurant was clean and definitely on par with the cycling theme. If you have friends who cycle, they'll love it. It's also right next to a canal with a walking path so if you want to walk off some of your food, you can head right out back!   I will definitely return. Thanks Spoke & Wheel for the great experience!",

    "text": "Disclaimer: If I sat at the bar and ordered the burger this would probably be a 4 star review.  1st time in. Arrived just at opening. Sat in bar area. Server was Caitlyn. Ordered drinks, didn't receive straws. Ordered appetizer, didn't receive plates. Appetizer was chips and queso. Dip was room temp, chips were cold. We graded the dip somewhere above Denny's but below Chili's. Underwhelming for location and price point.  Lunch was Sandwich of the day for me, cheeseburger for the Mrs. Sandwich was BLT in a panini style. Problem is, they grilled shredded iceberg lettuce. Just makes it brown slime. Her burger was pretty good. My side of mac n cheese was solid.   Service: We saw the bartender, Caesar if I recall, more than our server. He was great. She clearly didn't want to be at worked. While there, we heard our server complain to the bartender about taking a table that was a mother and her wheelchair bound child.  Cleanliness: pictures attached. Remember, they just opened, no excuses. The men's urinal had a significant amount of boogers on the wall above it. Given the shear quantity I assume this has occured for some time.....maybe a staff member? There were footprints in the restroom that consisted of maybe blood and feces? I'll include pics.  I really wanted to like this place. The bar is large with nice booths and there is a decent patio. The drink menu looks great too. But....I can't do it again.",

If you have any children who love buttered spaghetti do not bring them here and order the \"buttered noodles.\" We assumed this would be spaghetti noodles because it says it comes with a side of marinara, but instead it turned out to be macaroni noodles. The beer was fine, the restaurant was hot and the waiter stated he was unable to turn on the fan. However, he did try to cool our section down by turning on a \"swamp cooler\" but it didnt help. The fries were soggy from the oil, the burgers were dry and the \"mexican street corn\" was sour. Unfortunately, seeing the pictures looks more appetizing than actually eating here....",

From the outside it doesn't look all that welcoming, but once inside the atmosphere changes to new age hip meets traditional sports bar. The decor is great, the tables are clean, and the staff is super nice. During our dining experience they were hosting what looked like a baby shower and still had amazing service for the rest of the customers.   They had great beer, liquor, and wine specials during Happy Hour (Only knock was they were out of the beer I wanted, Goose Island). Appetizer selection was nice along with a wide variety of foods, soups, and salads.   Appetizers came out first like they should. Food came out hot and fresh all together like it should. Out of 5 of us eating, not one messed up order and all toppings were perfect. This place gots the dining experience just right.   We will return here for sure and also suggest it to friends and family when they travel to Phoenix. Keep up the awesome service guys and gals.",

A short bartender with arm tattoos took my order. I waited over An hour. I finally asked the bartender how much longer... he said the order was canceled thru DoorDash. I agreed and that is why I placed an order with him because the DoorDash order was canceled. I simply reminded him you asked how I wanted my burger cooked and what side I wanted. He proceeded to say the door dash order was cancelled. I kept asking him what happened to the order I placed with him and he had no recollection of it. Instead of admitting he was wrong he proceeded to argue with me. I am appalled about how I was treated. As I was leaving he shouted you're not paying for your burger. I simply stated it was canceled and you never took my order. My boyfriend and I ate here over A year ago and had a similar experience of waiting over an hour for his food because they messed up the first order. Clearly, nothing has changed.

It's a great idea, like an oasis in the desert for cyclists.   I ordered the Spoke N' Wheel Burger which was divine! It had caramelized onions, jalapenos, cheddar, sweet potato fry, and a sweet chili sauce. It was phenomenal, very juicy, and delicious! I also ordered it medium rare and that was done right as well. They had unique sides which was refreshing. I ordered the Sweet Potato Waffle Fries, but they also had Sauteed Garlic Kale, and Grilled Asparagus, among many others.   On another visit I had their hatch green chili burger which had \"honey, hatch green chili, pico de gallo, queso anejo enchilada (Mexican style feta cheese)\" which was delicious as well! And I ordered it with their parmesan and garlic fries which had actual garlic, not just garlic powder, they were great too!  The place is clean, the bathrooms had beautiful finishes, and the service is great! The only downside are the prices. The burgers are between $13 to $16. So keep that in mind unless you come in with a bike, then you're always welcomed to the happy hour menu at anytime of the day!",

The sandwich was delicious / packed with flavor and served smoking hot so the cheese was perfectly melted . However I took away one star because my fries were cold and had fresh grated garlic on top but no taste or sight of Parmesan.  It was not was I expected.  The staff was friendly and attentive. Aside from the cold fries I'd definitely recommend going.",

    "text": "Spoke and Wheel is located just south of Dunlap and Central Ave - This place has been several different restaurants but with the updated place the decor is super cute and trendy.  Bar; We came on Easter and you could tell it may have been busier than expected - so we all had the Bloody Mary bar that was Amazing.  The bartender did tell us please let her know if anything was not avail and she was replace immediatly.   Food; I tried to Easter Brunch menu and this dish was Avacado on a Toast dish, while it doesnt sound delicious it was Amazing and the hash browns if that what you want to call them are amazing.  Its hard to decribe these hash browns - they are whole potatoes in diced into large piece than maybe fried and/or baked but delicious.  Service; Oh boy - like mentioned above not sure they were expecting to be as busy as they were and service was a bit slow. But our server was definietly working his butt off - and you could tell her was super busy, we didnt mind helping him out.     Will def go back again and again.",

The wings were not cold but they were definitely not hot enough temperature wise or spice wise.  All visits were at opening time and every time there was one bartender on duty and no service staff.  Bartender was doing prep work (cutting fruit, stocking) with her back to the room.  Service was very slow and bartender was so focused on prep and set up that it was difficult to get her attention.  For the price, it was an okay deal.  For the service and attention, it was very overpriced.  The last visit sealed the deal.  I will not return.",

    "text": "First, the good. Spoke & Wheel offers deals for those who ride their bike to the restaurant. This is a fun way to get there and you get some exercise to and from the restaurant. I'd love if more places did this kind of thing.   As much as I want to like Spoke & Wheel it's honestly nothing special. For an appetizer, Chips and Guacamole were okay, the chips are thin flimsy plain Tostito's type chips with your run of the mill guacamole.   I got mushroom burger, which was the only veggie burger on the menu. It was fine but the sweet potato fries I ordered with it were sparse and average. I don't get why some restaurants serve ketchup with sweet potato fries, like.. come on. They don't go together. It's the small things like the chips you get with guac, the fries you get with a burger, the bun of your burger that can make a place seem like they care about their product, and that is where this place lacks.   Although there are a lot of televisions in the dining area, they aren't positioned well to be easy to watch. The booths lining the wall are a half circle shape, with televisions on the wall above the table. So really the only people who can see the closest tv are the people on the ends of the booths. It is seat yourself, so if you decide to go, just make sure to pick a table or a seat that you can easily watch tv from, because many spots are the equivalent to obstructed view seats in a stadium.  If you're going to this place on bike to get a couple beers and drunk food, yeah that would be an okay idea. If you're going to this place with hopes of enjoying a quality meal or trying to impress a date, I'd pass.",

The server was excellent and was definitely on top of everything. Thats very refreshing. Some places you wish you had some flares to light ..not the case here. My food was also spot on. Let me go into detail about how happy I was that my burger was cook perfect med. This doesnt happen very often when the gf orders hers well done. Both came out as ordered. Great tasting and great fries! Now the reason for the 3 stars. Cleanliness.. please clean your light fixtures.. they are full of dust and bugs and its a very big turn off. This is not a few weeks worth..this is years worth of grime. I hope you spend more care in cleaning the kitchen and to be honest the only reason we have not been back. You did everything right except make sure to clean. The thought of a dirty kitchen is whats kept us away..because if you dont care in the dining room..most likely the practice is the same behind the closed doors. I wish this business the best.. we will be back in a few weeks..if its still dirty. It will be our last time in",

The banquet room was fully decorated, and made formal with linen tablecloths and napkins, they even printed a custom menu for us.  Even with their most modest price point, the food and service was absolutely 5-STAR... Today is the day after the party, and my crew is still talking about how good the dinners tasted. Additionally, we had appetizers and dessert.  Our event was just about 3-hours and included a cocktail hour too.  When considering a restaurant, where a private room is necessary - and modest cost is a must; I would say look first at Spoke & Wheel... You'll be delighted with your choice.",

We brought our 6 month old baby and our dog to enjoy a family meal together which we rarely get to do.  I ordered the Sonoran hotdog. It was awful. Extremely dry, bad bun and not much flavor except for the mustard and salty dog.The hotdog itself was hard, crunchy and old looking. I am a huge foodie and always finish all my food...this, I could not. It was that bad. I hardly ever take time to write a review unless something is spectacular or so awful that I want to help others save their money.  My husband ordered the the truffle burger and mac and cheese. Burger was mediocre at best. Mac and cheese was so bland, I looked to make sure it wasn't buttered pasta.  We definitely will not be returning here. If you live in the area and are looking to just ride in on your bike and have a beer this place will serve just fine...other than that, save your money and go somewhere else.",

We've been to all the previous establishments at this location and liked the look of its latest incarnation. We invited some friends to join us there last night. After looking at their menu on line and reading some of the reviews we almost changed our mind about going but are so happy that we did. We like what they have done with the interior and the patio. We chose to sit on the patio since it was so nice. Our friends got there first and had ordered a $5 pitcher and white sangria's. The White Sangria's were out of this world. Also, the Happy Hour menu was pretty good. $6 for a bowl of mussels? Crazy. I ordered the ahi tuna street tacos and loved them. They came with a side of beans which were great. My husband ordered the Fish & Chips with the charred kale as a side. The kale was fabulous. Our friends ordered the cactus salad which was interesting, though not my favorite. Nice that they have several types of fries. We got the sweet potato waffle fries which were pretty good. For dessert we decided to try the banana churro and were not disappointed. Very tasty. The service was pretty good though it took the waitress quite a while to come back after she dropped off our check. They also didn't have a few of the beers that my husband was hoping to order. Otherwise, everything was spot on and we will be back in the future.",

The lovely patio was empty, and indoors it was pretty empty.  As other establishments, there was a Sunday brunch on the menu. We were invited to only sit at the bar and the very limited happy hour menu was our only choice, unless we were willing to take part in the $30 brunch. The food was very good and the brews hit the spot after the very warm bike ride. I may revisit. The female bartender finally warmed up to us, but the initial continued stop signs of, your options are only this and that, was not a way to start off my first experience with Spoke and Wheel.",

The food took about 40 minutes and this was after we politely asked if our order was placed.  We had to ask for refills and our check at the end of our meal.  The server brought us our credit card receipt and then said. \"Let me get these plates out if your way\".  Slow and poor service may be acceptable if the restaurant was busy.

    "text": "After Strong Beer Festival on Saturday, we were in desperate need of a cool place to chill, hydrate, and eat up and this was the chosen spot. We got a nice spot on a patio and really enjoyed it out there, it was a perfect evening for it. We shared some nachos, chips and queso, and my friend had a burger and mac and cheese. Food came out quickly, drinks weren't as fast but we did get an update from our waitress on those so that was just fine by us. I thought the food was pretty bland and unremarkable, the chicken \"chorrizo\" on the nachos was nothign more than ground chicken with some onions and spice which left me wanting more.   Downside is probably the lack of attentiveness after the food was dropped off. I would see our waitress go by and look at the table, but because we had drinks on the table, she assumed we weren't ready to go. After about 30 minutes of being done and ready to pay we finally waved her over, while I understand that a half-full beer might mean to you that we're just taking our time and you shouldn't bother us, it could also mean it just wasn't good and we're ready to head out.   That being said, not a dealbreaker or really a reason to not to come back. After all.the entire menu looked great, the setup was nice and the decor was very inviting. I'd like to come back during the day and enjoy the patio along the canal, get a full meal and the full experience but for now was just kinda meh.",

We tried the Mack and cheese with fresh fruit fish and chips three street tacos and the burger with garlic Parmesan fries. The fish and chips was bland fish that was fried with a plain tempura on it, however the regular fries were tasty as if they were cooked in a high-quality oil. The street tacos had excellent presentation and the steak taco was my favorite of them. The burger was outstanding as you could taste the quality of beef. The garlic Parmesan fries were overwhelmingly garlicky and would probably knock Dracula dead! Not sure we would come back because there was nothing to write home about out of the four meals we had.",

First, nice staff, on point with us, taking the orders and such. The place had less than 30 people in it and it took quite a long time to get out dinner, not that big of a deal. Most of us ordered burgers and fries, which is about $15.00 each. Here's the important parts. $15.00 for a burger and fries? The bun was enormous and the burger wasn't anything special. The fries come in a basket and we're also small in portion for the $15.00 price. Trust me, it's definitely not worth the price!!!!! Even the French Dip was 15.00 and that wasn't anything special either. After reviewing the menu we all agreed the prices are to high, exaggerated for the portions and it definitely wasn't anything tasty.   Save your money, time and effort...Go to Fuddruckers, Red Robin or even Smashburger",

We were able to sit 6 ppl on the patio in comfortable furniture. The service was slow. We actually had to flag down a waiter several times. We ordered, I got the 3 street tacos from the happy hour menu and garlic fries as an appetizer. My water tasted like it came from a sink but was made tolerable by adding lemon. My husband and friends ordered pitchers of beer that were warm and flat. The pitchers were small, about 2 1/2 drinks in each. They were sent back and the waiter suggested another beer that they had on tap that was better.  When my fries came we didn't have any napkins or plates, flagged down waiter again. When the food came it was delicious! Everyone seemed to be happy with their food. The garlic fries were really good as well as the street tacos and the beans that came on the side. When the bill came I was shocked to see that the mixed drink I ordered was normally 9 dollars! I thought that was a lot for a drink served in a mason jar. Luckily we received happy hour prices because we rode our bikes in.  I'm giving 3 stars because of the beer, expensive mixed drinks, having to ask for napkins and the poor tasting water.",

Tons of seating with a nice large bar on one side. And a large covered patio area outside. We sat inside. It was too hot still to sit on the patio. The lighting was just right. The booth was nice and comfy. They had a nice full bar drink selection. Good Happy Hour prices. We were just there for burgers and soda's that night though. We had the Spoke and Wheel Burger: caramelized onions, jalapenos, cheddar, sweet potato, arugula, sweet chili sauce. It was a good burger with a nice kick. There isn't one thing I didn't enjoy on this burger. It surprisingly went together very well. The other burger we got was the Hatch Green Chili Burger: honey, hatch green chili, pico de gallo, queso anejoenchilado (mexican feta style cheese.) This one was a tad disappointing. Not as much flavor as I was expecting. But still a good burger. We both got the delicious parmesan garlic fries. I look forward to coming back and trying a few new things.",

The service is always what kills it each time, the waiters either didn't know the specials, beers, or just rarely came by. Each time the waiters were never very friendly.  Today, the 18th, we were attended to once every thirty minutes, our waters sat empty for quiet a bit of this time. When we finally got our orders in, the food came out burnt. Both orders the same, my girlfriend ate hers due to hunger but I had mine taken off our bill. No apologizes were given, or even empathy, just a simple \"ok I'll comp this\".  I'm extremely disappointed, I'm still hungry and now in a bad mood. I won't be coming here a fifth time nor will I be recommending to anyone.",

    "text": "A friend told me about The Spoke and Wheel. She said it was a bar that catered to cyclists. Her description fell short. I rode my bicycle there because they advertise \"Bicycle in for All Day Happy Hour\".  From the moment I arrived I was impressed. They have an enclosed patio (with a misting system) and that's where they provide their guests with parking for their bikes. I quickly realized that this is *not* a bar, but a family friendly restaurant that encourages folks to get out, be active, and have fun.  I had the Fish Street Tacos, and the fish was grilled - not fried. It smelled wonderful and tasted even better. The staff was very accommodating, friendly, and attentive to their guests.  I saw a review where someone regretted not living close enough to ride in. So I have to suggest... If you live too far away? Drive to one of the parks along the canal, and ride in from there. The paths along the Arizona Canal are wonderful to ride, or run, on. You'll have a beautiful ride and an excellent atmosphere to relax in, cool off, and enjoy yourself.",

    "text": "WOW!  Order for pick up: Signature Ahi Tuna Burger s/o Sauteed Garlic Kale, Bacon Truffle Burger s/o Mac n Cheese  1st entree: I'm so freaking happy I ordered this. My first thought was tuna atop a beef patty (as it says burger). Though i was first surprised by no beef patty I was blown away again by the taste and texture of this patty! An absolute gem of flavor, hats off to your kitchen staff I will definitely order this again!! However, the kale was a little tough to eat on the basis that it needed to be chopped or sliced thinner. But once again the flavor of this side did not disappoint. Great texture so it was cooked with care. The garlic was clearly visible which for me is a total plus and the use of vinegar on the greens cut through the delicious fattiness of the tuna. Near prefect dish. I drank a coffee porter with this dish and would instead recommend a non-soliciting porter or stout (up to Russian Imperial -- this dish can handle it for sure).   2nd entree: A quintessential comfort combo. The mac n cheese was prefect! We all know the nightmare of mushy Mac n cheese where you can't tell cheese from noodle, well this was none of that. If they make this cheesy yummy sauce in house i would be even happier with this side ( also good choice of noodle ). After devouring that first I wasn't ready for more richness or so i thought! The Bacon Truffle Burger was an unctuous culmination of intense flavors embracing the palate not too intensely, which was very pleasing. Ordered it medium, but it was medium rare (i assume because they expected carry over due to pick up order) but I wasn't upset it was still delicious. I recommend a light/ citrus-y IPA with this meal to break up the richness.  Thank you Spoke & Wheel, i thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience.",

It has tacos,  soups,salads, sandwiches, burgers, ribs, Carne asada plate and the list goes on. I came in craving tacos today, so I had their street tacos and though the 3 taco platter was about 10 bucks, I must say there were no regrets. I tried their hoki fish tacos, their steak tacos, and their braised short rib tacos and I have no complains about any of them. The ingredients were fresh, everything was well cooked and the flavors on each had a tasty, refreshing balance.  Also, the service I had was phenomenal. I was seated and had my drink within 2-3 minutes of my arrival. Then the food took no longer than 10 minutes after ordering.  I will definitely be visiting again.",

They were good, but they weren't anything special. A few of the wings actually came to us dry; without the buffalo sauce on it. I did like the plate for the wings, though. It had a built-in dipping bowl for ranch. We also ordered a shrimp po' boy and sweet potato fries. The fries were good and were waffle cut. Unfortunately, the shrimp po' boy didn't have enough flavor. It was decent generic bar food, but that wasn't was I was looking for and hoping for at this place.",

We only has one drink each and Granted we were sitting at a table and there was one other table in the room that was occupied and one person sitting at the bar so it would be hard to keep track of what was going on,  but it only became a problem for us after we paid the bill and the bartender REFUSED to give us our credit card back until we virtually handed her the empty mug and stood up to leave!

Without hesitation,  he said \"Ross you need to go to the Spoke and Wheel, you're going to wheely like it!\" I gave him a courtesy laugh, rolled my my eyes, and proceeded to drive down to the restaurant.  As soon as I walked into the restaurant, I was promptly seated at a nice table near the patio. What a cool place! I liked the bike theme they have going on all around.  My server (Caitlyn?) was very helpful with food and beer recommendations for me. I told her I was looking for something on the lighter side since my metabolism seems to have halted lately. She recommended a the Veggie Street Tacos. I was skeptical at first as I'm not a fan of just veggie only dishes, but she had nice legs so I decided to trust her. BOOM!!  She hit the nail on the head! The tacos were Amazing!! Plenty of guacamole which I love, and super fresh Pico de gallo, crisp cabbage, and a little bit of creme dressing on top for flavor! I can honestly say I am now a fan of veggie dishes! I was so happy with her recommendation, I asked her to surprise me with dessert.  KAPOW!! She did it again! She brought out some sort of Banana Churro dish and Holy Smokes!! It was so good!! Just writing this is making me want to go back for more. She told me can can bring my dog in there next time which I thought was pretty cool. Thanks Spoke and Wheel, this was a nice welcome for a guy new to the area. It \"Wheely\" is good!",

    "text": "I recently moved into the area in November and have been exploring the neighborhood restaurants.  I had seen the restaurant before but had never stopped in for a bite.  Located right along the canal as well as the Bridle Path along Central Avenue makes it easy to get to on bike or foot.  I don't have a bike, but contemplating getting one to take advantage of their bike-in for all day happy hour.  Too bad there isn't a Lyft/Uber for bikers.  Their french onion soup is delicious and only a small upcharge to replace your side with the soup; I think it was a dollar more.  I've also dabbled in their fries and sweet potato waffle fries, which are delicious; so is their mac n' cheese.  Their burgers are juicy, the buns are beautiful, and the blacked chicken sandwich is awesome.  TBH, we have gone probably 15 times so far and everything we have ordered has been tasty.    Great draught beer selection.",

    "text": "I guess I would say 3-stars - though the Yelp-explanation of 2 stars is more what I was thinking: \"Meh, I've experienced better.\"  I have driven by here a number of times and wanted to check it out. I see people biking and going in, which seemed fun, like a great neighborhood spot. We are a little bit far to bike, and seeing that it was a Friday night that we decided to go, we drove.  We waited a bit to be seated, as we walked in at the same time as another couple and we all kind of stood there unsure of what to do since there was nobody at the host stand for some time. Finally a young man came up, sat the other couple and then us. The dining room wasn't too full, and they seemed to seat people in the surrounding booths first which was all good for us - until we saw the booth we got. It didn't seem that it was a big deal to sit right next to the bar, until after awhile we learned there was a server's station right behind it in a little spot between the edge of the booth and the bar. Constantly, server's were squeezing in and out of the spot and talking there and it got to be a bit much.   Our server was polite, but not all that friendly. I would say service was just average, no connection there. Maybe she didn't want to be there, maybe she was working a double, maybe her knickers were literally in a twist - who knows?  We ordered a round of their signature cocktails - see photos uploaded. Nothing special, a little overly sweet. I switched to beer.   We both ordered burgers, medium. They came to us medium rare but by this point we were over it and just ate them. I had the Spoke and Wheel burger, good flavor and combination of ingredients, I wouldn't not-ever eat it again. He got the Bacon Truffle Burger and thought it was okay, nothing to write home about.   I don't know what it was with our experience that just nothing really stood out. I mean, the place looks cool, we liked the decor and lay out. We were more impressed by their cool light fixtures than all of the TVs. It wasn't really busy for a Friday night, so the energy level was 'meh'. The service wasn't great, I mean, the host who couldn't have been over 20, seemed to be the most chipper person in the place. The food tasted good but wasn't cooked to order. The drinks, well...  I guess that's why we agreed it was just a \"Meh, I've experienced better.\" But on my scale, I would still say it's a 3-star, good not great. But to each their own! I am sure this is some people's favorite place in the city.",

That and $5 pitchers during happy hour make this a great local hang out. Trivia nights on Saturday are a lot of fun too, but look out for the \"wild and crazy guy\" he usually wins every time.",

    "text": "I love a restaurant that is has a dog-friendly patio, that will always get my business at least once.  We've eaten here twice this week, and I found it to be a mixed lot.  On both occasions the service was not as good as I'd expected: I don't want staff at my arm every five minutes, but letting my tea go empty for 15+ minutes is excessive.  Sunday visit: had the bacon burger with the truffle oil, ordered medium well.  Medium well means between medium and well-done.  It was decidedly more on the medium side of that scale, which made for a sad burger.  Having said that, the parm/garlic fries were quite good, though I thought they were also a little under-done.  We also had an appetizer basket of fried calamari, sadly it was very chewy.  The breading flavor and dipping sauces were good, but it took a lot of jaw action to get them down.  It also seemed like the wait staff was busy bustling about and not getting a lot done, full of sound and thunder but signifying nothing.  It's possible they were under-staffed for a Sunday afternoon, I don't know.  Wednesday we met friends there, some of whom frequent the place, we walked and brought our dog.  The patio seating was nice, but again, the service was not up to what I think are decent standards.  I think they should have one person on the patio with a ticket station out there, instead there were long periods of time that no staff were out there.  The food was a much better experience, I had the Sonoran Hot Dog and it was excellent, I'd definitely return for it.  That being said, everyone else liked their food, so overall, I'd say good food but don't expect top-notch service.",

It advertises as a family place, but a family of four eating reasonably can't get out of there for less than $50. There's something there called \"Spot at the Bar\", where you can get HH drink prices all day. Ride your bike, HH drink prices as well. Otherwise, a very short HH that ends early... Not good if one has to stay later at work.  The wings are excellent- we had the chipotle wings. The burgers are solid, but I wish they had some pizza selections. The mixed drinks are great! Beer and draft selection is average. It would be nice to install a double fridge with some unique craft bomber selections. Trivia nights are packed and fun! The overall ambiance is nice, although I can never quite get the right angle for TV sports, especially when sitting at one of the booths. The service is inconsistent, but has been improving... Brian (does he still work there?) and Ruby are friendly and quick. The location is great, too. Located on the canal, so it's nice to stop in after a run or ride in NorPho. Views of PHX Mountain Preserve are great. A big plus, dog friendly patio. Definitely worth a visit, even a return visit... But have some bucks saved up.",

We were really excited to try this place...we had been fans of Dillons and the countless other restaurants in this spot and went with an open mind.  First off, it was noon on Monday and there were only two other tables with customers.  It took forever for service, our waiter was not helpful, in fact, we ordered our appetizer and he assumed we'd want it with our lunch (you know what they say about when you ASS-UME).  We had to ask for silverware - he brought out two of the lunches and did not return with the other two.  He finally brought out one more and totally spaced the fourth.  The portion...another ASSUMption.  My friends did not order lunch portions, they ordered off the regular menu and when we questioned we were told the computer ASSUMES you want lunch.  Communication, caring, personality would have made this such a better experience especially since we live nearby and would love to frequent the place.  Have to say, the food was good.

    "text": "We were really excited for a nearby, bike friendly restaurant/bar, but tragically we were met with one disappointment after another. Despite eying open tables in the main dining room we took a seat at the bar after being told by the flighty hostess that here would be a 30-45 minute wait.  First visit, we decided to play nice and stick around.  Once at our table I ordered a margarita, about 10 minutes later it was delivered to the table but with sugar, not salt.  Ok, simple (not really) mistake, but when I sent it back, asking for salt the waitress returned and let me know that it was the first they made that night and they only had \"sweet and sour\" salt.  I knew for a fact it wasn't the first since someone next to us that the bar ordered two earlier, and honestly, invest in some margarita salt.  When it came to the food there was nothing of redeeming quality.  We ordered the calamari as an appetizer, the fish and chips as a main and I ordered a side salad with the dressing on the side. The calamari took quite some time to arrive, then literally about a minute later the meal arrived.  Bad timing.  The calamari was rubber-tastic, my side salad was smothered in dressing, and the fish and chips were nothing special in the least.  You think fish and chips, you think cod or halibut, not trout.  Why ruin a good thing with a fish that doesn't belong.  The fries were lack luster and cooled almost immediately after arriving, meaning they'd been sitting out for a while before being delivered.  On an atmosphere note, whoever designed the space should really reconsider another career.  Due to a low ceiling at the miniature bar the stools were shorter than usual, making the bar surface a bit too high.  No one likes feeling like you're in a high chair when you order an adult beverage.  Moving into the massive, rather bland, far-too-many-TV's-mounted-on-the-walls dinning room, I noticed a random video gaming area in the far left corner and next to that was a massive TV blasting FOX news. On a personal note, YECH, but on a customer note, honestly could you not pick a more one sided, alienating broadcast!!  We almost left at the sight of the station choice and should have taken it as our sign.   Moral of the story, if you have decent taste, and appreciate good service, this is a place to pass up.  We paid way too much money for a bad bar scene, bad food, and a design confused atmosphere.  Despite the close ride, we will not be returning.",

The happy hour prices are fantastic - $5 sangria that is full of flavor and plenty of booze, $5 pitchers of local beer, and great food options to boot. The regular dinner prices are also good, and the food was all around pretty tasty. The fish and chips are crazy delicious - literally some of the best I've had - but the chicken, biscuits, and macaroni and cheese were lacking in the same sort of scrumptious-ness. The chicken suffered from what I detected was an improper breading process, so the coating fell off quickly and grew soggy as well. The macaroni and cheese was made with cheese that coated my palate in a weird way, though it was seasoned properly unlike the chicken. The biscuits, however, were fluffy and delicious. Overall the food for the table was so tasty it still deserves 4 stars!",
