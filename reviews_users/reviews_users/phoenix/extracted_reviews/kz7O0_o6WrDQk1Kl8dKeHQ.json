    "text": "Tried out this place on a Friday night recently.  I was impressed with the decor.  They have those popular Edison style lights everywhere, very cool.  Also pretty dark but not too dark.  All the staff I encountered were also very nice.  The place was pretty packed and noisy as to be expected on a Friday night.  We sat at the bar and the service was good.  I was impressed with their craft beer selection on draft.  I guess you could call this place a gastro pub but they also specialize in mixed drinks.  I tried one and it was good.  So was the beer.    The food, on the other had, was hit or miss.  We started with the beet salad which was amazing.  I can't recall a better one that I've had.  Then we had the pork chop and swordfish. the pork chop was $19 and did not come with any sides.  The green beans were $6 but enough for two.  The pork was cooked just right, juicy and pretty tender.  My only issues was it lacked in flavor.  Salt helped some but not enough.  It was all right but I wish it has more flavor like it had been marinated or cooked on their grill!  I ordered green beans with that which were grilled and they were great.  I just wish the grill flavor was on the pork chop too!.  The fish, on the other hand did not seem like the freshest.  It was also a little dry, overcooked.   It was not bad enough to send back but  wasn't very good.  It was also very thin so that makes it harder not to over cook it.  I wish I would have tried the Beer Butt Chicken, that looked good.  Maybe next time!",

Hardly any options for someone who doesn't eat cheese or meat. I know that's specific but usually I can find more things. Had the brussel sprouts and they were boring with little flavor for an app. Dinner I had a sea bass special. Fish was cooked well and sauce was good. Best part was the bread that came for dipping. Tried the sticky bun for dessert and it was incredibly disappointing. Dry in the inside and not enough cinnamon with bad icing - who knew icing could be bad? The drinks were good so I'd recommend for a happy hour.",

    "text": "I normally love Stock & Stable, but so many things were off on Saturday.  First, I reserved a \"high top\" table via Open Table.  It wasn't available.  Why ask if you can't deliver? Then the table wobbled, so we moved over one.   Dinner starts with the server pushing us to take our order before we were ready then not asking if we were ready for another cocktail when our drinks were empty, busser trying to clear plates while we were eating, server offering a box while we were still eating our appetizer. Geez.   Moved to the bar after dinner and had 2 more drinks and got the \"last call\" (at 11PM) while the bartender kept serving the party next to us. Perhaps his friends? Doesn't matter, it offended us.   Food was so so (except for the amazing Philly egg rolls) and the worst part was an over the top obnoxious birthday party (and I was a good sport and sang happy birthday when they got the WHOLE restaurant to sing) but they kept going and going and were yelling and shrieking and were clearly drunk.  Restaurant management should have intervened.  So, instead of offending one obnoxious table, they alienated an entire restaurant.    Many say...why didn't you ask to talk to management?  Because, it wasn't one thing; it was many many things that just added up.  We go there at least once a month.  Sad to say we'll be taking a break. There are MANY great restaurants in the area.",

    "text": "Yep, only two stars from me for this place. My friends and I were so excited to try this place after talking about it for weeks.   Being on Open Table-5 stars Building/restaurant itself-5 stars Hostess-5 stars Service-5 stars Food-1 star  Sure, that should probably bring it up to a better star average, but it's really about the food every time right?  Party of 4, we liked 1 out of the 5 dishes we ordered and shared.   Started off with the potted crab and the roasted cauliflower. The potted crab is basically a crab dip served with grilled bread. The bread is from an outside source which is a thick sliced white/sourdough type. The potted crab was a pot of crap! Hardly any crab flavor let alone any flavor at all. Not even any spices.   The roasted cauliflower was even worse. What really disappointed me in the cauliflower was that our server recommended it over another side that I wanted to try. She even said \"oh the cauliflower is the way to go because of how flavorful it is\". Did she mean it was the least flavorful? I hate to say that too because our server was really good.   Moving on to the main events. Two of us had the NY steak, another had the chicken sandwich and I had the Cuban sandwich.   The steaks were served sliced. I actually love this concept and it reminds me of a famous place in New York (I have a personal rule against naming another restaurant when writing reviews no matter how poor). I was so excited for the first bite and again was let down. Zero flavor, not even any salt and what was worse was all the fat and gristle, like hard gristle. Gross! It was like this on both steaks!   As for my Cuban sandwich, it was decent. I think the bread they used is the wrong choice as it's just over powering and takes away from the important stuff between those two slices!   The winner was the chicken sandwich. Fried chicken breast with sweet and spicy toppings. The bread for this one is a bun which nicely complimented the important stuff!   As I said, we liked 1 out of 5 dishes. That's pretty disappointing. I think simply adding some salt to a few of those dishes would have helped. Speaking of which, what is with these trendy places not having salt and pepper on the tables? Your food is not that good, get over yourself!   Sorry Stock & Stable!  Look at your reviews, people like your place but hate your flavorless food!",

The outside of the building is modern and just looks classy. We had the BEST waiter, Jeremy. He went above and beyond for us and really made our first experience. He was friendly, funny, and genuinely cared how we were doing. We ordered some drinks to start, North by Northwest, which is the name of the drink. It is made with egg whites and I have got to say, if you haven't tried a drink a with egg whites, you are missing out! It was a smooth drink with bourbon and a hint of grapefruit and the frothiness of the egg white on top. I, myself, had the Salmon and my girlfriend had the linguine (see pictures). The salmon was outstanding, juicy, seasoned and perfectly cooked. It is a light dish so you aren't bloated afterwards but it will leave you content. The linguine was very flavorful from the clams to the bread to the broth. It was just a pack of flavor with a subtle heat to it. It was the perfect amount of spice so you can still taste every bite but still get that little kick. Last but not least, the dessert. We went with the cheesecake and our waiter, Jeremy, made it himself! It was so good! It had pecan clusters and salted caramels drizzled and nice slice of cheese cake and with every bite it just melted in your mouth. Overall, wonderful experience and will definitely be going back. Thank you to our waiter Jeremy who made the experience that much better. I would recommend this place to everyone.",

The dumplings were tasty and served fried wonton style, topped with apple compote (seemed more like applesauce) and fried leeks (yum!). They were placed atop demi and a cauliflower puree which was a tad too room temp/chilled for my liking (don't place warm food on top of chilled sauce).   The Cubano was tasty - a great ratio of bread to meat/condiments and the bread was not too thick and was just slightly crusty on the outside and pillowy on the inside. Husband liked how much we could taste every ingredient on the sandwich and it all worked really well together. I'm thinking the pickles were house made and they added a wonderful sweet tang to the sandwich.  The atmosphere is warm, calming and inviting - a bit of old fashioned meets modern industrial charm. Darker tones, muted lights and candelight offer a perfect vibe for date night or get together with friends.",

I have kidney issues which means, I rarely (if ever) eat steak. So I figured for my birthday dinner I will order the NY Steak. 1- it is a tiny portion 2- it was over priced for the portion and the fact that it comes with no sides. Food overall was just overpriced and small portion. In addition, my guests went to \"the restroom\" aka to ask the waitress if they give bday cake or ice cream for the guests (usually it's complimentary).. they said no. There was just no accommodations for for a special occasion. So, as much as it's cute on the outside... not going to be returning anytime soon.",

Many tried it and concurred. Now if I could just accept the $6 price point.  For drinks, I had the Mission Hard Root Beer and tried my buddies Smith and Wesson pitcher.  The root beer was great and would order again for sure.  The Smith and Wesson was okay but doubt I would order in the  future. Many drinks to choose from here so there is no need to settle.

    "text": "So what's with the ampersand trend lately? Seems like all the hoppin' new restaurants are named with two arbitrary nouns and an ampersand thrown in between them. Not saying that I have a problem with it, just an observation.   Anyways, I met a friend here after work one day, and we decided to kick off our S&S experience by boozin' it up at Honor Amongst Thieves (now THERE is a kickass name), the speakeasy in the back and up the stairs. First thought upon walking in: holy shit is it dark. I know, I know, it's gotta have the whole speakeasy vibe. But they could turn it lights up just a smidge and still maintain that. They did a great job with the environment though, with the plush leather chairs and giant wall of illuminated liquor bottles. The bartender was nice and attentive, and didn't hesitate to answer any questions we had and provide his own recommendations. I ended up going with the Stole Fashioned. It was fine, perfectly acceptable, but not mind-blowing. To be fair, I'm kind of a snob when it comes to old fashioneds. But I likely would not shell out $10 for another.   We headed down to the restaurant after our drinks, really just looking for some snacks to graze on. It's a pretty open space, not terribly crowded with enough room to easily walk between tables. There weren't too many people there when we arrived, but it was still pretty noisy even though we were seated more towards the back. It took a bit before we were visited by our server, who was nice enough, just not terribly attentive. The service was in general was fine. It seemed to take quite a bit for us to get our food, despite it not being too busy in the restaurant. When it came time to pay, the server returned my friend's check without the card? She asked about it and the server looked momentarily confused before throwing out a vague apology and rushing off--presumably to find it. She returned a few minutes later with \"Oops! It must have flown out on my way back!\"   I appreciated that their menu was pretty succinct, but still diverse. We decided to go with the squid ink cavatelli and some frites. The cavatelli is life changing. Get it. And don't be freaked out that they look like little worms :) The frites were fine, but nothing to write home about.   My friend had the Eastern Promises, which I also had a sip of. In theory, this drink should be my Mecca. I love Thai tea and god damn it if I don't worship bourbon like a deity. But it was just... Disappointing. My friend told our server that she wasn't very into it, and she was nice enough to comp it for us on our check.   Overall, fine experience. Wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but I'd come back if someone else suggested it. The cavatelli was for sure their saving grace.",

    "text": "So...It was a great addition to the area but just wish these new restaurants weren't so trendy and expensive. I went with a group of 7 ladies for a friends birthday, they took our reservation and were even about 15minutes late and nobody said anything; showed us to our table right away. We had great service and our waitress was super friend. I loved the atmosphere with the big patio and plenty of seating inside as well. I would definitely be back to sit at the bar, but not for the food.  We decided to share a few appetizers for the table. We got the Salumi Board...DEFINITELY not worth the $25. Had a few pieces of bread, some thin sliced salami, a couple wedges of cheese, jam, and some mini sausages. I think it should've been half the price; pretty disappointed. We also ordered the Fermented Beets (yummy), Brussel sprouts (tasted like brussel sprouts), and the chili queso dip (small portion). If you're in the area, stop by for a drink and a shared plate, just know you won't get much for the price.",

No problem, we sat in the outside patio seating and it gave us time to look over the menu.  Scott brought us ice water and was excellent at describing what was on the menu.  We started with an appetizer that was linguini with seafood, artichoke hearts, tomatoes and sausage.  It was excellent however, a bit spicy for us but delicious nonetheless.  I had the Cubano sandwich which was spot on and I would order it again in a heartbeat.  My son had the Chicken & Mint salad and he loved it, not sure where the mint was, guessing it was in the mix of things but the swoop of creamy cashew butter was great.  We will definitely be going back!",

It was a good amount and perfect for sharing.  It was the cocktail menu that really turned us off.  None of us were familiar with the ingredients.  It's kind of intimidating and not cool when you have to google what each ingredient is. I understand trying to be unique, but there are limits!  I ordered the Green Acres...what a bizarre drink.  Maybe I don't have the right palate for this restaurant, but I did not like it at all.  Also, our group sat at the bar.  The service was less than impressive.  I felt like the bartender was just put out trying to deal with us.  She seemed annoyed, and barely checked up.  I may or may not give this spot another chance.

Also, the ambiance of the place is quite nice with little touches like a leather covered cocktail menu that play into the name which is cool.   However, we were disappointed with the food. I ordered the steak and eggs which was supposed to be a  5 oz NY strip but I'm not sure that was the actual cut of meat. I asked for the temperature of medium and got a well done piece. A sin against beef. Also at the table was pancakes. Although the portion size was enough for 3, the cakes were heavy, cold, flavorless and without the honey the menu claimed they had. The cakes did not come with sides. The preference would be a smaller portion of cakes served with at least one side. The maple syrup was cold. We asked to have it heated but their heating lamp must not be functioning properly because after 2 attempts the syrup was still very cold.   Last, the online menu is not aligned with the actual menu. We came for the Belgian waffle as seen online, but found they were not on the menu upon arrival.   Overall, a disappointing experience but the place has potential. They've got work to do.",

They have a separate menu for drinks however NONE of them looked appetizing and there weren't many to choose from. The wine list is even worse!! I wanted a glass of Rose which they had but they only sold it in a bottle.. I don't really understand that concept. The food was good! I got the cheeseburger but again I only had 2 options for cheese and only a few options for sides... Amanda was our server and I thought she was awesome!! A couple of my friends didn't feel she was attentive enough on drinks but she was super sweet and answered the 10,000 questions we asked. Lastly, they do have a very cool speakeasy themed bar upstairs. And by cool I mean literally.. It was freezing!!! My friends and I could barely stand being in there.  I recommend trying it but I probably won't be back",

Not slow as in speed of movement but in thought process she couldn't answer basic questions about anything and she didn't have a lot to offer us as guests in a new restaurant. Maybe it was her first server job so idk but like i said she was nice so it was whatever. The menu was a good combo of breakfast and lunch options which is what you want for brunch, hubby ordered the beef tongue hash, I ordered veggie hash, girlfriend ordered biscuits n gravy everyone enjoyed their food. The flavor on the veggie hash was really good. I enjoyed it. Oh Yea they have $5 mimosas and bloody marys so we had two rounds of these that's always great for brunch...probably got them that extra half mark to get to four stars. They have a speakeasy lounge upstairs that opens in the evening I want to try. I will definitely be back other menu items looked good and it's in my hood.",

As we stood at the hostess stand reading both the brunch menu and the regular menu, food was going by us and it looked damn. We could have waited 20 mins but we decided to go ahead and get seated on the patio. First and foremost it was a beautiful day, the patio is in front of the restaurant in a shopping center called The Colony right off 7th street and Missouri. My husband ordered the burger and fries and I ordered the chicken sandwich with a simple salad and the best dang chili vinaigrette. While basic food on a brunch menu my husband ranked it up there in his top best burgers. The fries were hot and tasty with sea salt. My chicken sandwich was deep fried but not greasy and the pickles and bun made this a great sandwich.

    "text": "This was a great lunch choice for my business meeting.  The crowd was mostly professionals at lunch meetings it appeared. I had the Cuban Sandwich with a side salad. It was amazing and full of flavor. Frankly, I could have taken half of the sandwich home but I choose to eat instead. (So much for portion control).   The service was fast and the server was on top of her game, even with a large group being there.   I would recommend the patio if possible as it is fully covered and gives this venue a SoCal vibe.   There is also a full bar which I didn't have a chance to try, but I will looking forward to sampling the offering in the future.   Check out this great spot!",

The atmosphere is great but then the hipsters come out & service is one area where this place is weak. Our server was friendly & just didn't have that snappy attentiveness I expected given the menu prices. $42 for a filet that should have been medium but was overcooked to well done. The food is ok but overpriced for what you get. They need to step it up in the kitchen or lower the pricing. Best thing eaten were the Philly egg rolls. Lastly, I ordered an old fashioned that was drinkable but not enjoyable. It wasn't well balanced. We won't be back.",

I asked for my burger to be well done and waiter said it usually comes medium to well. I thought that was odd but made sense when my food came so quick. They don't prepare to order. Burger was smothered in toppings and I couldn't even eat it. Fries were amazing tho.  My friend ordered the yellow tail tuna fish and said it was gross and should not charge $22.  Kung Pao califlower appetizer was actually unique and tasty. So I recommend coming for drinks and appetizers.",

The AGM made a point to swing by and welcome us, and the servers were very attentive. And what a gorgeous restaurant, to boot! The beer list was also smartly chosen, too. Hard to do, nowadays.  A wonderful smoked corn manti to share was a great way to start. The manti was perfectly al dente with this ridiculous butter sauce. I could have licked this plate.  We also tried the jalapeno popper, and these crazy people serve it with stuffed with a soft and melty marscapone mixture. It was pretty perfect.   Then I got the fish, a black cod with this tasty tomato sauce with so much flavor. My fiance got the Cuban sandwich. He was happy with it.    I would certainly come back for more. I am particularly interested in their brunch!",

The service was fast and friendly; the real standout here however was the food!! In True gastropub style this was innovative and delicious!  Our group of 5 decided to order a bunch of appetizers; the white bean hummus was delicious ( it looks a bit thin but more than makes up for this in taste ), the Shishito  peppers were great, but the two standouts were the Kung Pao cauliflower, we ended up with a second of that one and even our one non adventurous eater enjoyed this fish assuming it was chicken and not an actual Veggie!! And the seafood plate was a surprise - more of a ceviche and so fresh and delicious!  The appetizers were so good we just kept ordering more and skipped the mains entirely. Good beer and wine selection to wash the food down and placed looks great with a nice low key vibe",

The server stopped by our table once to see if we wanted something to drink, before we got waters. After over 10 minutes of repeatedly walked past our table with any acknowledgement, we left. The hostesses just said, ok- bye. Sad when you want a fun night out with family and a fun dinning experience.",

The burger was pretty good, nothing super special but the fries were very crispy. My wife ordered their chicken and mint salad and that had really good flavor. It was basically like a chinese chicken salad, very good. We also got a side of the pesto mac n cheese. Pretty cheesy and had good flavor overall. Drinks were delicious. Their specialty cocktails are very balanced and not too sweet. Would definitely return to try some more things on the menu. Entrees are not cheap though so plan on spending some extra money here.",

    "text": "Celebrated my wife's 30th birthday here with 13 of her close friends and family.  Over all the experience was enjoyable but there were a few issues along the way.  Setting up the event was simple and difficult all at the same time.  I set up the reservation with the gentleman that answered the phone for the group and he confirmed it but also said that a manager would have to call me back to fully confirm the reservation.  This was on a Thursday and Wednesday of the next week I still had not heard anything back, so I called to confirm the reservation.  I was transferred to the manager who told me that he had been on vacation, which is not a big deal but have someone else cover your job or have your staff let customers know it will be a week before they get a call back.  After talking to the manager he did confirm the event and told me that he would be sending an e-mail for confirmation right when we got off the phone.  I never received an e-mail (yes I checked the spam folder).  As I had already got confirmation over the phone I was not to worried but if you say you are going to email then send an email.  The day of the event went pretty well.  We had a single server for the table and he took care of everything with no issues at all, I wish I could remember his name, as he did an amazing jog..  They manager did put together some great whiskey tasting flights for the group and our food was all served at a single time, which is amazing for a table of 15.  My biggest issue was with the whiskey selection.  I chose Stock and Stable based on what they had listed on line for their whiskey selection (me and the wife are big whiskey drinkers) because we were planning on trying some really rare whiskies.  Unfortunately they literally only had 1 out of the 5 we were expecting to try.  Other then that everyone enjoyed the food and the atmosphere, I would say the price is a little high for what you get and have had better food other places for the same or less.  Overall the food and whiskey selection is a 3/5  The service while there is a 5/5",

The service and food were both excellent.  We started with the dirty fries and they were amazing.  My wife got the cheeseburger and I got the crispy chicken sandwich and we were both very happy with our choices.  Even now, I'm eating the second half of the sandwich a day later, reheated in the microwave, and it's tasty enough to motivate me to write this review.  Drink-wise, my wife got a couple of glasses of white wine and had the rambling man.  You might balk at a peach/whisky drink, but this was amazing.  I'm no somm, but I enjoyed every last bit of my glass.  All in all, we had a great experience and will definitely be going back.",

Perfectly spicy and, I'm not sure if they fry the cauliflower, but there is a great crunch to each piece! It's almost like you're eating meat. The Crab Cakes are interesting as well. They aren't like any I've tasted before. There is a slightly Indian flavor to them from the curry and peanuts. The spice really hits you when you eat them, so make sure you have some water.  All in all this is another great restaurant to try in the Arcadia area. Definitely sit on the patio! It makes for a great atmosphere.",

Their Beer Butt Chicken was definitely my favorite of the scarce entree selection, but the NY Steak and the Double Cut Pork Chop didn't disappoint, especially paired with the Tuscan Kale. As far as cocktails go, the Cottontail was my favorite of the few I tried, and the least favorite was the St. James Infirmary (a bit bold for my liking), all in all it's definitely a place we will revisit and a great addition to uptown.

We had the garganelli, fresh greens, frites and the steak.  Everything was fresh, tasty and well prepared.  Good wine and beer selections.  Looking forward to exploring the menu.  Recommended.",

The warm kale salad was definitely large enough to share. I liked it but not enough to finish it (even sharing with a friend). I wish there was an option for a simple side salad.  The Cubano was a good size and pretty tasty. The smoked pork shoulder was delicious. The service was good but it was a little pricey for lunch.",

It was placed between two rather thick pieces of Texas Toast, covered in a sausage gravy, and too with two eggs, over easy. The sausage gravy was unremarkable, not much flavor, the two pieces of Texas Toast overwhelmed the meal. Due to the thinness of the meat, iI would ask for it with one piece of Texas Toast.  The location, ambiance, and service were wonderful. Overall, it was a positive experience.",

Now, They have changed the bread, have put a little pulled pork,  and I mean a little ,some cheese with their pickles and mustard, and that is it. I am very Disappointed!  Also they have now raised their prices! They also have added their Pork Chop back on the Menu, but it is no longer stuffed. I have not tried it. I probably won't at this point!   Sorry guys!

We were seated promptly, but then it took about 15 minutes to be served water. The waiter claimed that there was confusion between who had our table. This is with the restaurant not even a quarter full.  The no substitutions thing I can understand, but if you're paying $15 for a sandwich, you should be able to swap a side for an up charge and not have to pay the full price. It's not that upscale of a restaurant to demand such a thing.  There is an aura of attitude that is not yet deserved.  The wine selection, while interesting, is very limited; they did not offer a Pinot Noir. In addition, there were no flavored (limon, raspberry, etc.) vodkas.  My meal was indeed tasty, but nothing incredibly special. The fries with truffle and Parmesan were good, but not the best I've had.  It's a new restaurant, and I think with time they will work some of the kinks out. I would recommend waiting until then to eat here.   Will try something else next time I am in Phoenix.",

Fork tender premium cuts of meat cooked perfectly and farm fresh (super high quality) veggies... Need I say more?    Well done for a brand new restaurant still barely open a full season.  I say this because new restaurants always have kinks to work out as does this one, I'm sure. But to be so young and still manage to impress is deserving of the high rating.

Had heard great things that were supposed to come from this new place so we were pretty excited.   First impressions of the decor was that the place looked amazing. Rich colors, county accents with leather and wrought iron, looked great!   After staring at the drink menu for a while trying to figure out what in the world all these fancy words meant (thank you Google dictionary) our party of 4 ordered the Green Acres, 2 Solera Gomez's and the bartender's Blue Ribbon drink (rummer time(?)). Our excitement disappeared as soon as we took our first sips. Now I've had some bad drinks, usually it's the bartender pouring too heavy, but these just tasted awful ingredient wise. They didn't blend well at all and just seemed like someone was trying to be too artsy and out there. We all looked at each other, said ok chug em down and let's go somewhere else cause it was obvious we didn't have the palates that this place was concocting for.  Hopefully their cocktails will be switched up regularly to something more edible or we may come back for just wine and to sit on the patio to enjoy some appetizers..or we could just go to Postinos which always impresses.",

Got our drinks right away and thought the food cam out quickly...everyone who waited on us were great.  Then we headed up stairs to the bar. AWESOME and will definitely be back.  Decor in restaurant and the bar were well done.  Very excited for a fun new bar in the area!",

Ordered from their well prepared Easter menu.  My wife & I shared the Smoked Salmon-N-Eggs with mascarpone, fresh sliced tomatoes, chives & arugula.  The Green Chili Strata was so flavorful, and finally the Eggs-N-Purgatory with sausage, pomodoro sauce & Noble toast topped with a sunny side up egg. All orders were cooked to perfection!!!  For children 12 and under, a special table for them was set up where they could build their own pancakes with several toppings, cereals, yogurts, etc.  Looking forward to our next visit.",

The place is nice inside and out, the patio is great during cool weather. The service we received was good, very attentive and friendly. We all ordered something different from a pretty simple menu which can still be challenging. I ordered the biscuits and gravy which had the right amount of salt with biscuits that were fluffy and moist, topped off with a sunny side up egg. Others ordered French toast sticks. I didn't feel compelled to order any cocktails on this particular day but the list looked amazing. So the 1 star missing is for the next visit for cocktails to determine if I can change my score. I recommend going on a Sunday after 1 to enjoy a non crowded meal.  Everyone enjoyed their meal.",

Weekends there are brunch and late night is supposed to turn into a lounge with a DJ.   I got to try an array of different food from their menu and I loved ALL of them and recommend them as well. - Prosciutto Benedict: perfectly poached egg with abundant holidase sauce, topped with arugula, salty proscuitto, and gruyere -Cesar Salad: light vingarette like dressing on top of smoked toasty bread with avocado - Crispy Chicken Sandwich I didn't get to try their pecan pie but it looked like it was to die for.

But first, I want to credit how amazing the service is from the host that takes my order over the phone, to the server that brings me water as I wait and to the bartenders that are extremely knowledgeable of their wines and very accommodating.  I typically call in my order for pick up or I will have a glass of wine at the bar as I order my dinner to go. Although the ambiance of this place has an upscale trend and amazing bar, while at the same romantic with the lighting and rich dark wood... I always show up in my pajamas or gym clothes, head straight to the bar and receive the same cordial treatment as anyone else. Note-the menu has changed a bit but still just as delicious is not better. The portions are extremely generous for the price and I always have left overs. The to go containers are pretty legit and dishwasher safe for reusing.  Definitely recommend stopping by.",

The crab Mac and cheese was a little too fishy for my taste but everyone else loved it. The Philly cheesesteak egg rolls were excellent, the aioli puts it over the top. The corn dog appetizer was okay, good sauce options but overall nothing Id reorder.   My husband had the filet and said it was absolutely amazing, it was flavored and cooked perfectly. The creamed corn was spicy but delicious, the corn was crisp and sweet which brought a needed burst of sweetness between the cream and spice.   I had the salmon, cooked how the chef recommended and it was moist and flaked perfectly. The salmon and the accompaniments had no flavor even though the description boasted Asian flavors. Other people tried it and agreed they would never order it, many stating it wasn't anything they couldn't just do at home. It may have just been an off night because other people have raved about it. Maybe if it had more sauce it would have boosted the overall dish.   The cocktail drinks are creative and delicious, I don't know if you can go wrong with any of them.   Service was excellent but both times it was difficult finding our server to get our check.",

I didn't know which route we should go down: lots of small plates (which are hearty portions BTW) or a small plate and entree. The hubs and I ended up starting with two of their specialty cocktails: I had the Busty Lou (in honor of my ample bust-not) and he went with the Sonoran sunset. Mine was better it was grapefruity and I dig the hell out of grapefruit. The hubs's cocktail was almondy and I like to eat almonds not drink them--can't handle that.  Anyway to the food! We shared the jalapeno popper and the linguine. The popper was less of a popper and more of a torpedo. Big, but great flavors. Don't expect it to be your run of the mill TGIF frozen jalapeno popper because it's not. It's so much better than your average popper so respect. The linguine was phenom. I wanted to put the leftover broth into a coffee mug and take it to the house. But I didn't want to embarrass the Hubs. Our salad course was good too! I love a good panzanella salad and this one was top notch! I'm not crazy about burrata like some people are so I would have enjoyed this salad more without it but whatever.  The NY steak was perfectly prepared and seasoned. So good. That's really all you need to know about that. The frites are more like your traditional French fry. IMO if you are going to call a potato product a frites they have to be like matchsticks. The mushroom side was really solid.  And let me not forget their fricken awesome 80s music station that they are tuned to. I could sit there all night and get lit up listening to Hall and Oates do their thing. Super solid music going on.",

Would never tip this man again or go to this restaurant for making it seem like the world is ending to separate a check. It's 2019 chill tf out. People separate checks.

We ordered our drinks of the Coco Verde and Old fashioned and were given waters in their signature cups. The gentleman who was refilling our water cups and our waiter were very polite and generally checked in on us here and there to see if we were enjoying ourselves. We ordered our pork belly buns and they are a high recommendation on the list. We also ordered the bolognese and the beer butt chicken w a side of pesto Mac and cheese. The bolognese pasta was definitely my favorite because of the pasta itself. It was a good texture and perfectly cooked. The beer butt chicken was seasoned well, maybe a tad less salt but that skin was definitely to be desired. The pesto Mac and cheese was a nice addition w the creamy sauce and pesto combination. For dessert we ordered the chocolate brownie which was nicely topped w caramel and ice cream. The one thing I like about this restaurant that out to me was the consistent picture perfect presentation on each dish. As an amateur food photographer that is what made my day as I look back over the pictures. Definitely will return to try more soon",

There is something off about this place--the service wasn't bad--but it wasn't right--here are things that were strange.  I am a tea drinker--i ordered hot tea and the only tea bag they had was chamomile.  I know how  herbal teas are popular now-- all that they had was chamomile-a very odd choice as it is usually used at night to calm ones' nerves (oh wait--maybe now I understand)--there wasn't a black tea--ie. earl grey, english breakfast or even a lipton tea bag available--so i ended up not having tea this morning  (which does make a girl cranky)--my friend and i ordered a drink--they brought her gruet first and then after several minutes brought my virgin mary--really they couldn't bring the drinks together?  it is not like the place was overwhelmed.  They overcharged my friend for her gruet--only by a $1 but made no effort to resolve it even after my friend brought it to their attention.  As we were leaving--now about 11:30 they posted their $5 specials on mimosas--did our server mention this when my friend ordered the gruet?  Nope.  the menu is trendy--but not particularly interesting--they would have been better off with doing a straight ahead menu and doing it well.  there is something off about this place--maybe because they are still working stuff out-I might go back because friends want to go there--but it would not be a place that will come to mind that I want to return too--",

We found Stock and Stable, and on the spur of the moment, we went in and grabbed a couple of beers and some food. I couldn't believe what a knowledgeable waitress we got on the beer department - and she recommended a sour that was just out of this world. Then, I tried a burger and fries and it was the best thing I'd eaten all week. Their fries are fat and full of parmesan, crispy on the outside and soft like mashed potatoes on the inside. Unique! The burger was to die for. My colleague had some kind of salad and she was raving about how good it was. We thought it was a cool vibe and we're so happy to have run into the place. Midway through our meal, the GM brought over the beer and spoke to us -- super nice guy, not the normal \"Everything OK?\" question, but a real conversation. I would say that this place is going to be on our list as a go-to destination from now on!",

There were not any shortcuts taken on having this place come together the way it did.  From the food, service, lighting, decor, ambiance, and just overall feel, this is an excellent place for  a date, or a larger party.

I can't comment on the food, but the drinks we had were just alright. The hh specials include 3$ off specialty cocktails and some food specials, which is a decent deal. I got a very odd green drink that had matcha, honeydew, and wasabi... it was super weird. I didn't love it, but my friend liked it alright. To be fair, the bartender offered to make a different drink, but I didn't think it was bad enough to warrant that. My friend had a gin drink with blackberry that was much more pleasant. The drinks that look the most delicious were the cocktails that came in a pitcher... not sure how large a party you need to order a pitcher, but I would like to try the one with the chai... yum. The service was fine and the food coming out looked good. I would definitely like to come back for happy hour another day and try some other drinks and some food. I also love that they get their pastries from Lux... awesome!",

I am an avid Opentable user and do not like going to a restaurant with out a reservation but when I tried to book a table, it said that they were no times available for the entire night. So I called and the hostess, Alexandria, told me that if we got there right away then we could get a table otherwise they were booked until 8PM. Alas, I went back to Opentable to try and book something for after 8, still no availability. So we immediately ordered an uber and arrived to see that there were 9 (I counted) vacant tables and it was 6:40PM. Alexandria told me that they were all booked for 7:00 resos. We went to the bar and noticed that there was always at least two empty tables for the entire night. Alexandria was not rude or unpleasant, they just don't know how to operate reservations. When I was in college I was the maitre d for four years at a $16 million dollar restaurant (Mastros) so I get frustrated when I see restaurants not efficiently running the dining room.   More importantly, the food was good. The bartender with purple hair was incredibly nice and had great recommendations of what to order. She told us her name but after a few titos, I could not remember. We enjoyed the food, atmosphere and sitting at the bar. Just spend a little time teaching the hostesses how to use Opentable and maximize capacity!",

The brunch menu is pretty concise and there's something on there for all palates. My wife had the Prosciutto Benny which was pretty good. It wasn't the best she's ever had, but she liked the pesto and arugula that was included and the sauce though quite pale was tasty. She found that the prosciutto was  a little too thickly sliced, and that there was slightly too much of it. (Never a complaint about too much from me!) I had the Cubano sandwhich with a salad. It was really good! Generous portionof smoked pork and ham with lots of melted cheese and pickles. The bread for both dishes was perfect! Crispy crust, light fluffy inside and mine was toasted wonderfully and glazed with oil which I love! The salad was also a nice mix of leaves with a tasty and balanced vinaigrette. I was going to try their chicken-fried staek and egg, but it seems it's served a la carte without any sides. I asked if it came with any and was told that it was just the fried steak and egg on the plate. I suppose I could have added a side of fruit for $4 but I generally dislike fruit at brunch, being a savory kind of guy. I would have ordered that had it come with a handful of salad or slaw on the side, just so I could minimize any nutrition guilt.  The only do French-Press coffee so don't expect to order an espresso or cappuccino, but the coffee was dark and flavorful. I had their iced tea which was fine.  The Hostess was friendly and our server was also top-notch answering all of our questions.  We are interested in seeing what this place will be like for dinner. I can imagine with a bar that huge there might be a bit of a scene developing there. Once I try their dinner menu, I will update my review and possibly upgrade them to a 5-star.",

When we order waitress asked if we would like salad instead of fries....well sure we thought (even if uncharge would still be worth it).  Our party wasn't being cheap; about 6 drinks; sausage plate AND 4 entrees. So when we got check:  we were charged for $15 burger.  When we ask waitress her exact response was \"ohh; that is a smaller burger and i didn't know that is what you wanted\"  NO offer to make it right or even meet in the middle.

However, after checking out their menu, I knew I wanted to stop-in for their food too. We went on a Saturday around 3:30pm and sat on the patio since the weather was beautiful. At that time, they were offering their dinner menu.   Chicken wings: Absolutely fantastic! The chicken was fried to perfection but not greasy. While the menu says it's a BBQ sauce, I would consider it more of a hot sauce base since it's spicy and vinegary. You get 3 large wings... the 3 largest wings I've ever seen.  Beef pot roast: Melt in your mouth deliciousness. The mashed potatoes were also really good. The portion is very generous, I could only eat half before I was about to go into a foodcoma.   Fried chicken sandwich: I had a bite and it was just as good as the chicken wings. Again, the chicken was fried perfectly so that it was crispy but not greasy. My BF said it was the best chicken sandwich he's ever had! The fries were also really good, I definitely stole my fair share.  This is definitely a place I would love to come back to, especially for brunch since their brunch menu looks really good. Definitely check this place out, especially if you like craft cocktails... you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "I was super excited to try this place. Why not Valentine's Day? Reservation made, great. Get here, one of the hostesses refuses to seat us at a table closer to the heaters because \"they have other parties coming in and it's for a four top\". At the time of this post, which is 2 hours after being sat, no one has been seated at that table.   I ordered the double cut pork chops. I understand the kitchen may be backed up due to it being Valentine's Day. I ask for the pork chop to be seared with a brown crust. The server, Aaron, hesitated and responds with ok. At that point he should've made it known that the double cut pork chops are broiled and not seared. The pork chops come out and they are not brown at all. They haven't been seared at all. I let the runner know I asked for the pork chop to be seared with a brown crust. He says it's well done. Thanks, but I didn't ask for a well done pork chop.   They take the pork chop back, sear the already well done pork chop, and bring it back out. I take a couple bites and it was like eating paper. Completely ruined. I called Aaron back over to explain that I still would like the pork chop, but this one wasn't edible. Before I could explain that I just wanted the pork chop broiled less and seared more, Aaron cut me off and said \"the kitchen was already pissed that you wanted it seared so they aren't going to make any substitutions because of how busy we are\". Irrelevant and insensitive.   I asked for the check and Aaron brings it, along with an apology about the food stating he just knew they weren't going to change anything when he already knew what I was asking. I politely let him know he could have no possible clue what I would like because he cut me off. He takes our card and returns to let us know our meal is on him and that he again apologizes.   I'm pleased with his final solution, but not pleased with how we got there. I was hopeful about this place. I appreciate his gesture, but I do hope the service improves. The twice baked potatoes and creamed corn are phenomenal, as well as the crab mac and cheese.",

    "text": "If you grew up in Central Phoenix as I did, then you can empathize with the fact that the 7th Street corridor is becoming more and more unrecognizable from years gone by.  What was once a landscape dotted with small to medium size businesses ranging from craft stores to equipment rental shops is now absolutely jam packed with new restaurants everywhere you look.  So many in fact that I feel like some will inevitably fail.  Its just too saturated for all of these places to survive.  Only those that can carve out the right niche and step up their game to impress the increasingly sophisticated palettes of the CenPho crowd (and deliver value) will last.  Tonight with a free cocktail coupon in hand, I met up with my Dad for dinner at S&S to see if this place has what it takes.  S&S advertises themselves as a gastropub with an emphasis on simplicity.  Where it relates to the decor, they certainly come as advertised.  Simple (but fairly elegant) wooden tables and chairs, soft lighting, and a surprisingly large restaurant (seating for almost 200) that somehow retains a fairly intimate feel.  It can be a bit noisy in here when full, but for the most part I couldn't have been more relaxed just sitting in the dining area.  The staff was super friendly and unassuming all night and served as a great compliment to the meal we had.  I've heard from a few folks who've been here for brunch, but not a soul who's done dinner here.  So I was flying blind on this one for the most part.  The waitress recommended the Sweet and Sour Meatballs as a starter.  Good call.  Admittedly the sour note wasn't very well pronounced, but the sweet part certainly was.  Sweet potato, golden raisins and a little bit of fruit (I think it was persimmon) were in this dish which acted as something of a palette cleanser to the meatballs.  For my main dish, I always have a hard time saying no to short rib and this was no different.  My short rib was also dressed with the same fruit and sweet potato as the meatballs were.  The short rib itself was cooked perfectly.  The meat pulls off easily with a fork, was super moist on the inside, and only had a light amount of seasoning.  The meat juices here are really all the flavoring this one needed.  For dessert, I got the chocolate peanut butter mousse.  Came in what looked like a mini mason jar.  It may have looked small, but wow was it dense.  Think of it as the richest most dense Reese's peanut butter cup you've ever had, and that gives you a pretty good idea.  Both my Dad and I were stuffed to the gills, but super impressed by the creativity and the approachability of the food and the great service we got from our waitress.  Total cost for an appetizer, two dinners, two desserts, three drinks (not including my free cocktail), tax and tip came out to about $80.  So about $40 for each of us.  Admittedly we went pretty nuts tonight getting the most expense entree items on the menu (most of the entree menu costs half of what ours did), but boy was it worth it.  I'll be back to check out the brunch menu at some point, and would certainly come here to try happy hour as it looks like they've got about 10 food options for $6 each during that time.  Stock & Stable has hit on a winning formula which should keep them in business for the long haul here in CenPho.  Creative food, relaxed atmosphere, good value, and unpretentious.  Pretty much everything you want in a neighborhood haunt.  Another 7th Street restaurant down.  A gazillion still to go (assuming I can keep up).",

We shared the special (fried chicken dinner) and it was better than any fried chicken we've ever had.  We used to visit the south frequently and have never had fried chicken this good.  After dinner we went up stairs to Honor Amongst Thieves.  The music and vibe was the best in the city.

So far, I have tried the Beer Butt Chicken ($16), the NY Steak ($21), and the Eggplant Parmesan ($12). While the Beer But Chicken is good, I don't exactly think it's worth the price--plus, since it's boned chicken, you might want to factor in how elegantly you can dissect boned chicken if you're out on a date. The NY Steak on the other hand, is hard to find fault in. It is well sized and comes with some amazing dipping sauces.  They have happy hour from 3-6pm, which serves as a great opportunity to try out some of their cocktails for $3 off.  My favorite drink so far is the perfectly sweet bourbon based cocktail called Church on Time ($11 Regularly/ $8 HH).  Also, if you're up for drinks after your meal, ask your waiter or bartender to show you how to get up to the speakeasy-style bar called Honor Amongst Thieves upstairs for some unique drinks.",

So, take this for what it's worth but I really enjoyed my meal and I will be back.  Went for dinner on a Wednesday night with a cousin from out of state.  Got there at 6:15pm, promptly greeted and seated.  We elected to sit on the patio.  Typical nice October night in Phoenix.  My first impressions, very comfortable, casual restaurant.  Since we were there so early on a week night parking wasn't an issue but I could see it being a little challenging on a busy weekend evening.  It's next block south of Culinary Dropout on 7th Street so if you've been there you know how busy this part of town can get but we didn't have a problem at all getting a space.  We get our table outside, waiter came by to get our drink orders.  Neither of us had alcohol so I didn't even look at the available choices.  I had iced tea which was a little better than normal iced tea.  My cousin ordered the 10 oz New York steak.  It looked perfectly cooked from what I saw.  He wolfed it down pretty quickly so it must have been good.  He ordered a baked potato with bacon and sourcream.  Typical side for a Minnesota guy eating a steak!  That was a sizable potato and it also looked pretty darn tasty.  I ordered the grilled cheeseburger.  It was fantastic.  Perfectly cooked to medium.  The stock and stable sauce was delicious if not a little messy.  I was too busy talking to pay attention to the flavors but it was definitely worth a repeat visit.  It was a messy eating experience but sometimes those are the best.  The fries had a special seasoning of their own which I really enjoyed but again, too busy yapping to pay attention to what it was.  Next time I'll do better.  :)  And there will be a next time.  I will be back.",

I can't speak for dinner, and I do agree the brunch menu was slightly limited - buuuuut better to do a few things GREAT than many things AVERAGE, right? :)  Everything was super yummy, I had the chicken and biscuit (see photos) and loved it. Service was quick, split checks without a problem, and the location and patio are adorable.  Highly recommend sitting outside, it is kept well-cooled for Arizona. They do take reservations which is a plus, though it wasn't super busy (I heard they are more popular for happy hour, and we did see an extensive drink list!).  Hope to return soon!",

Another pro their happy hour menu items are very substantial compared to other restaurants. From the happy hour menu, we got the Kung pao cauliflower, fruitti de mare, salami board and also got other appetizers that weren't on hh: short rib dumplings and crab Mac n cheese. We ordered a lot thinking hh items would b super small but we were wrong!! They were huge portions! Everything was delicious!!! We had extra bread from the fruitti de mare and from the salami board which went amazing w the left over crab Mac n cheese! They should seriously add some bread to the Mac n cheese! Very good!  As my entree, I ordered the short rib since it was highly recommended w a side of brussels sprouts. This is where I was a bit disappointed hence the minus couple points. The short rib was very tender but soooo salty!! The first bite w the glaze made me cringe. Way too much salt in the glaze sauce. So after wiping the sauce from the short rib, it wasn't as salty but needless to say I was disappointed w this dish especially reading rave reviews on yelp. And the brussels sprouts were super salty too.   So overall the atmosphere, service and all the appetizers were amazing and worth trying.",

I'm not one to send it back so I just ate the waffle. All this for $14.  Additionally, they service was terrible. He never once check on us. Took forever to get another drink to the point where I had to ask the bus boy to go get the server. The server arrives and takes our order for more drinks. He proceeded to bring the check along w the second round of drinks. We paid that tab and had to start another one dedicated to drinks. Keep in mind it was not busy at all and open tables everywhere.

On top of that, you had to pay extra if you wanted a side to go with your meal. For how much I paid, I was not impressed.

    "text": "Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Stables? Just kidding, this ain't no Guy Ritchie production but they do serve some tasty brunch! It wasn't too busy around noon on Sunday when we ate here which made for a pleasant and relaxing atmosphere for enjoying our meals.   After browsing through the menu I decided on the shrimp and crab benedict ($13) and a Stumptown cold brew ($5). The more I drink cold brew coffee the more I'm thinking I don't like it? Most times I've had it I encounter a bit of a sour flavor profile in the coffee which I have to mask by using multiple packets of sugar. This was the case today, as I had to ask for a basket of sweetener to make the brew more palatable for me. The sweeteners they offer here btw are honey crystals, stevia, and regular sugar (I think it was Sugar in the Raw).   I did enjoy the benedict though. It was beautifully presented, with a well balanced portion of shrimp and crab with eggs, arugula, and some thick toasted bread on the bottom instead of English muffin. The combination of the creamy Hollandaise sauce with the peppery arugula, preserved lemon, and the natural sweetness of the crab and shrimp was nice. The eggs could have been a bit more runny for my tastes but that was just a minor point.   Service was decent and we were checked up on as needed.  If I were in the area again and looking for a good place for brunch this would be a good option.",

We didn't have a reservation, but were able to be seated outside right away, which was fine with me because I love sitting outside and they have a great patio. Even though it was over 100 degrees during the day yesterday, you couldn't tell here because they do a great job of keeping it cool without soaking you with misters.  Right away, we were really impressed with the draft beer list. They have a lot of lesser known options, and we were both able to try beer that we hadn't had before, recommended by our server, Andrew. Andrew was awesome, and gave us great recommendations on food as well. It was the best service we've had in a while, and he was actually honest with his opinions and told us when we asked about a menu option he didn't like :)   For dinner, my boyfriend had the Beer Butt Chicken with a side of frites which he loved, and I had the Cubano. I hadn't really thought to get that myself, but I was trusting Andrew's recommendations and I was really glad I got it. So good! The frites are really good too, and are seasoned with rosemary and parmesan.   At first, I thought this place seemed kind of expensive, but you get a ton of food for those prices, so it's really not bad. For happy hour (M-F 3-6p), they do $6 burger and fries, so I definitely want to come back for that! They also have a cocktail bar upstairs called Honor Amongst Thieves, which I can't wait to try. We don't really like cocktails so we were unsure, but Andrew let us know that they also serve all the beers that Stock & Stable has on draft.",

    "text": "Stock and Stable has disappointed me yet again. I made a reservation a month ago and had to wait for 45 min due to the incompetent hostess, which sat 4 tops with two people. My reservation was at 8pm and we did not get a table until 9 pm. The hostess made an attempt to make things better by giving us a free appetizer and one drink for a table of four that ordered  appetizers, wine bottles, entrees and dessert.   I went there with a friend for happy hour and the  waiter was a bit sassy when we asked him to pre order some drinks before happy hour was over.   Then today was the last straw, a group of us showed up early and some folks decided to join us and the hostess stated they could not accommodate several additions to our party and the restaurant was basically empty. I am not sure who is running things there but customer service is not a main focus.  I called the Herb Box next door they were able to accommodate us and have a great time!!! BTW they have a great happy hour!",

    "text": "The service was seriously wonderful! Every two minutes someone would come by and refill our water and make sure we had what we needed which was nice. The crowd was around 40-50 year olds. The menu was not huge but what we ordered was very good! The menu prices range from $14 to around $30, with most things being around $20. We got the Cubano sandwich and the burger and also split the philly steak egg rolls. The cubano was delicious! The poem was nice and tender and then bread was really chewy and good. The burger was really good as well. It was juicy and tender and had two patties with cheese melted in between. They forgot to put the egg rolls in and brought our dinner out first so the waiter comped the appetizer and brought them out with our dinner, which was very nice. They were also great- super cheesy and beefy and came with spicy mayo to dip them in. The waiter was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and all their drinks. Overall this place was good for a date night, just a little more expensive than I wanted!",

Service sub-par. 105 degrees out and had to ask twice for ice in tea. Ordered the crispy chicken sandwich -- this was a pre made chicken patty on store-bought bun. (Was told use Noble Bread on other sandwiches so expected a bit more from buns) At least the pickles were good. My friend ordered the burger--again, store-bought bun and was told could not cook beef to temperature. For a place touting 'Stock and Stable' expecting a rock-star level burger. Would have had better sandwiches from Chick-Fil-A and In-N-Out. Definitely not the quality product have come to expect based on other restaurants in the area. Hope they get it turned around as this is an interesting concept with potential to be great.",

    "text": "The value alone makes this place a great choice and hangs up on your usual avenues in dining and drinking.   The ambiance is spot on. A nice wrap around bar in the center and tables surrounding. Stop cooled down and pretty perfectly placed for a sundown drink.   Ordered a lot so try and keep up.  Port of call - perfectly balanced sweet coupe cocktail.  Dog and pony show - quasi Moscow mule sub gin. Prob the easiest to drink when it's 100* out. A table favorite. Carolina red - personal favorite. Most flavored cocktail, I could see this as a hit or miss for most. Not a new drinkers cocktail. This guy has some heart to it. Solera gomez - Least favorite. But not bad, expected a tad bit more sweetness but had a touch too much bite for the group Remember the Alamo Pitcher - They have cocktail pitchers, multiple choices too. Really great idea. Fun way to share and commune. Def jump down this road because it's served in a classy glass and packs a bunch of flavor and balance.  Roasted cauliflower - solid side dish. A good amount of salt, perfectly cooked cauli, good texture with the breadcrumbs. Could've used more of the cream sauce. That stuff was legit. Salt cod tots - A fun little fish tater tot. A tad heavy on salt but two people at the table absolutely loved these. Ate every last bite. ****Beef tongue pastrami - By far my favorite dish. It's playful, full of flavor, perfectly cooked. I could eat this guy every day and still want more. **** Potted crab - not good. Most pricey app but he least favorite. Texture was too wet and soft. Crab was lost in the mix. Wouldn't get again. But definitely didn't ruin the experience of the place.  Overall I loved stock and stable. Small personal preferences prob knocked them down the one star but I'd recommend it to anyone. I'll def be back and do another gauntlet of food and drink soon. There is still around 30 other dishes and drinks to try. See y'all soon!",

    "text": "Nice ambience. Stock & Stable is located in an upscale, up-and-coming area of Phoenix. If you sit outdoors on their posh patio, you'll also have a view of the Circle K gas station down the street. It's kind of unique in an endearing way. They have a great beer and wine list, though the selections for food seemed a little narrow and heavy. Restaurant was much quieter than the other places nearby. I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "I went for Saturday Brunch. For the short review: The ambience of the outdoor patio was great! The service was awful and the food lacked flavor including their sausage gravy. I don't plan to come back.   It took over 10 minutes to order drinks after we sat down and spoke with our waiter. We ordered our food and drinks at the same time. 20+ minutes later we got our food but still no drinks! When our drinks finally arrived I realized what a ripoff their cocktails were!  $12 for a small old-fashioned champagne glass. (And this took you half an hour to make! At 1:30 pm, your place is practically empty!)  We were very specific that we wanted the bills split between the food ordered for here vs the food to go. The waiter simply split the bills by every party member.  It took another 10 minutes to pay the bill.   I have a friend that loves this place. If it weren't for the ripoff cocktail prices and the horrendous service, I could see going back. However, the service was so awful that I will probably recommend The Yard just up the street instead.",

One person wasn't drinking and she just sat there. Took forever to get a menu. I don't blame the service entirely, maybe understaffed, but without a doubt he was far nicer to the guests around my girlfriend and I. We did nothing but sit at his bar and it appeared from the first minute he wanted nothing to do with us. I've bartended and served and I hate having to give these reviews. But his service was rough. My girlfriend is much nicer than me so I didn't say anything. Again, great food. But if you're not a regular prepare for rough service.",

I would definitely come back to this restaurant again and recommend it to friends!!! The food I had (minus the super dry pork chop the person I was with had) was amazing!!!

You add 2 bucks to an old fashioned because of bitters????  Who adds money for bitters??? An old fashioned is a well drink..yet not considered a well drink on happy hour..so they charge the extra money for bitters.  Never seen anyone do that.  Was our anniversary...and it was a wreck.  Overpriced....had better steak at Applebees.  With the name of stock and stable...steaks should be amazing.  Also for the price of steak..a small amount of potatoes and mushrooms shouldn't cost extra.  Total bill after 4 alcoholic beverages on happy hour..a ribeye...a NY strip..mushrooms..and potatoes was around 130 bucks...way too expensive.",

But back to reality, we had a lot in common from our favorite foods to our philosophies on life. He has such a beautiful smile so of course I was doing everything I could to make him laugh. He was so sweet, complimenting me every other minute. He's a good kisser too. Because he's so busy he's basically a homebody but when has that ever stopped me.",

Pastrami Buns: Not a fan. The buns are supposed to be soft but they seemed old and were really hard. I took the insides out and tried to eat it with a fork- which still didn't help.

    "text": "We came here for a birthday celebration. The ambiance was okay, a little dark and couldn't take a good picture. There's a bar upstairs you can go to after dinner for drinks. Maybe I'm a little old, but a DJ with no dancing was odd to me lol, especially with the type of music playing. If it was Jazz, it would make more sense.    Food: the hubby and I order the rib eye steak medium. But I didn't know medium meant burnt. I don't like my steak overcooked or too raw. My husband's words, \"it's Denny's steak with a little bit of flavor for $38\". We were going to take it back, but we really didn't want to be \"those\" people.  Good thing we shared.  The sides don't come with it. The sides were pretty good (asparagus) and for appetizers, it was one with a seafood platter, it was decent.   The best part was the company and group of friends we were with.    Not a big fan and I'm not sure I would try this place again.",

It started off bad right away with the hostess and continued throughout our meal. The ribeye and sea bass were very over cooked and took 55 mins to come out to our table. Our server was very short with us and did not make us feel welcome at all. I expected more from a restaurant were i spent $150 on a Wednesday at.",

My friends made a reservation for us and we walked in and got seated right away. Started off with a bottle of bubbly, I think it was LaLuca Prosecco and that simply just hit the spot. For our appetizers we got the Kung Pao cauliflower and the Frutti Di Mare. Both were simply amazing. The cauliflower was exceptional if I may add.   For dinner we switched to a bottle of red (unfortunately don't remember the name) and for my dinner I got the the Rib Eye, and my friends got the Bolognese and the Hot fried chicken. Everything was just done tastefully and was delicious.   Server was very friendly, very attentive and took good care of us. The manager also stopped by when dropping off food and said hello. Nice staff overall.   For desert we got a piece of this crazy flavorful cheese cake that made me want more. The restaurant made it special and put a candle on it. This was an amazing   Can't wait to come back.",

    "text": "Full disclosure, this is just a brunch review. I used to come in quite a bit for a happy hour and once for a really nice dinner, never a complaint. However, this time was a little bit different. I came in on 8/17 about 1:40pm after work. Really I just wanted a beer and a snack.  I will say I could tell right away that bartender who was also the floor server just did not seem happy. I got my water and menu right away, but Barely any eye contact, short answers, no smiles. Not welcoming at all, not what I'm used to here.  I was greeted with the brunch menu which apparently goes until 2pm. Keep in mind, it about 1:35 or 1:40 and outside of me there are 2 tables with people there and an empty bar.   She finally comes back around I ask if there's an option outside of brunch because I just wanted a snack and it was 20 minutes until brunch ended. Her reply with barely a look \"No, just brunch.\"  Alrighty then.  Looking for something small, I opt for the biscuits and gravy. The menu describes it as sausage, fried egg, pull apart biscuit. Sounds good.  What actually arrived was a bowl with a fried egg over plenty of gravy and what I though was one biscuit and one sausage patty. Unfortunately it was actually two very large and dense biscuits. Not pull apart at all, and not very tasty.  I was looking for the sausage but did not see any until closer look, which turned out to be a very small bits mixed in the gravy, which maybe I should have expected, but did not. After a closer look, it was a lot of sausage skin and if you're lucky, maybe a quarter link ground up in the gravy.  Having to wait for her to come check on me, I took a couple of bites, ate the fried egg, got through a little bit of and biscuits, lost my appetite and was done, it just felt gross. I asked her if they forgot the sausage or if that is how it comes, she replied with absolutely no concern at all \"no, just the gravy, would you like to order a side of sausage?\" Ok, I was officially over it. I declined and then heard her yell to the kitchen \"side of gravy!\". Was that her passive aggressive way of trying to appease me? It was a huge turn off. I Tried to ask her if that was for me and said it wasn't necessary, but she didn't reply and walked away. I just wanted out, had to flag  her down for my bill, and ended up paying just over $20 for a beer, a fried egg, and a couple of bites of gravy and biscuits.  Ended up leaving the opposite of relaxed and unwound. Yay.  Note to self, avoid between 10-2 on the weekends. 2 stars for the beer and fried egg, which came as advertised. I doubt this is the new normal here, it had been a while but with the competition around, I don't think I'll be back. Why bother?",

We were greeted politely by Ben and another tall bar back (male with dark hair).  Ordered a glass of wine and was given a decent pour.  We have both eaten and had drinks here before and enjoyed it.    This review of one star is for the other server (Red haired pregnant) working that night.  As my wife and I sat there enjoying our glass of wine we witness this server notice lipstick on a glass that she had just made a cocktail in.  Instead of dumping it and getting a new glass and remaking the drink, she used the bar rag to wipe the lipstick off.  The worse part of this was that we watched her do it twice while we had our one glass of wine....surely wasn't pleased with the sanitary conditions we were witnessing.    To make things worse, we also, in the span of one glass of wine, watched this same bartender wipe her nose across the back of her hand and then continue to make drinks, not stopping to wash her hands.    Sorry, but this could be a deal breaker for me coming back...too bad, we have always enjoyed it each time before this.",

The waitress, unbeknownst to us and without request, apparently decided to add premier liquors to the couple beverages that we ordered, because our bill reflected upsells.  This place refuses to split bills for larger parties, or at least it did for us, and our waitress was rude.  When a manager was requested at a subsequent time, the staff member refused to get one.  A manager later called and was rude and disinterested herself.  If I were the employer, I would be very disappointed.  As a customer, I am disappointed.",

It looked about half full but they had us wait at the bar until our reservation time, which was weird. We didn't get any service near the bar for about 10 minutes, until some server walking by asked if we were ok. We told her we were waiting for our reserved table and she left. After a few more minutes, we got sat at a table close by. We sat for 10 minutes without anyone so much as even stopping by. Two other tables were seated nearby us after we were seated, and they were both given water and service. After being ignored for about 15 minutes with no water, no server, and no contact whatsoever, we gave up and walked out. The hostess and some other employee hanging out at the front desk didn't even look up as we walked by and left. Pretty sure we're not coming back.",

I asked about gluten and our server, Jeremy, told me they could pretty much make anything not requiring gluten work for me. S,o no linguine, but lots of stuff on the menu is gluten-free without modification. We started with the white bean hummus which came with an delicious mountain of very fresh vegetables; the mixed carrots were like candy. This might sound like a weird complaint, but there were so many veggies that we could have used more hummus. (The hummus itself could have been a tiny bit zingier.) I'm doing whining; everything else was perfect. I had the perfectly cooked pork chop. The herby butter sauce was sinfully delicious. My husband had the Caesar salad with chicken. About the dressing he said, \"It has so much garlic in it, it ought to be illegal.\" We shared the grilled asparagus which must have been prepared over a wood fire because it was distinctly smoky, a good thing in my view. We shared a bottle of the Ano Verde Pinot noir. It was as good as any Pinot noir I've ever had, and at $40, a very good value. And then we discovered that bottles are half off on Mondays and Tuesdays, so we only paid $20 for it! We didn't have room for dessert, so obviously we'll have to go back. (Hint to my husband) I love the decor and they were playing blues, but not so loud that we couldn't talk. Jeremy provided excellent and charming service, and then at the end of dinner, showed us upstairs to the speakeasy. Another patron told us it's crazy busy on Friday and Saturday, but it was delightful on a Monday night. And we discovered white port; who knew such a thing existed? Definitely have to go back.",

    "text": "Yum yum yum! I don't live in Phoenix but I've been trying to make my way through the new 7th St restaurants every time I visit. I ended up at Stock & Stable for Easter brunch this time, and it was such a good decision!  The restaurant was pretty busy, but we didn't have to wait for a table. We asked for a table outside and got a seat in the sun, which was okay with us (the hostess asked first). Note to S&S: on hot days, maybe don't put the silverware out until the party is seated, since it heats up and is too hot to use! In retrospect I shouldn't have been too surprised by this, but they had a special Easter brunch menu, instead of their normal brunch, which had looked amazing and that's why we picked to come here in the first place. No matter though, the Easter menu looked delicious and we settled on the salmon and Dungeness crab scramble and the Scotch egg with a side of toast.   The scrambled eggs were for me and I was so pleased with my dish. The eggs were cooked with the crab, chives, and Mascorpone, there was a sprinkle of arugula, and a good-sized piece of grilled salmon lay on top of it. When I first started eating the eggs, I had my sunglasses on and couldn't see the crab, but I did notice the crab taste. After I took my glasses off though, I realized that the egg to crab ratio was like 50-50. There were also large enough whole chunks of crab that I could pick a couple out for my husband. The eggs were creamy and the crab tasted fresh. I thought the salmon was a little overgrilled, but I like that charred grill taste so I'm not complaining. It was a nice accompaniment to the eggs, which I thought were really the star of the dish. My husband seemed happy with his meal too. The Scotch egg is a 6 minute egg wrapped in sausage, breaded and fried, over an arugula salad with grapefruit. I didn't have any of his food, but he ate the whole thing.  I'm not sure I'll ever be in a position to recommend a brunch place in Phoenix but if I am, I will for sure mention S&S. My sister-in-law says their dinner menu is great too, so hopefully I get to test that out soon!",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Good, solid dinner.  Not all the dishes were great, but many were something we'd come back for.  I'll start with the main drawback of the night.  Busy Friday night.  It was crazy loud.  We were near-shouting the entire time.  Now on to the food.  This place is all about sharing.  We shared every dish that we ordered between the 4 of us.  Even the steaks come pre-cut for sharing purposes.  We ordered the following:  Salumi board - Probably the best dish of the night.  5 meats, 2 cheeses, Noble bread, tapenade, some pickled veggies.  It was a good size and each component was pretty darn tasty. Pork n beans - Actually green beans cooked in pork.  It was fine.  Beans were crisp and cooking in pork added some meatiness to a veggie dish. Farfalle - Slightly spicy in a seafood broth, this was maybe the second-best dish.  The spice saved it from general mediocrity. Gnudi - Decent gnudi, pretty heavy on the truffle.  These little suckers are pretty filling for their size. N.Y. Steak - A good steak for a non-steakhouse steak.  Definitely need the butter and chimichurri on the side to liven it up, but it was cooked to a good medium rare (a little closer to medium) and had decent flavor on its own. Frites - Decent fries, nothing special. Tuscan kale - Decent kale, nothing special.  So even with the shouting, we'd probably be back.  It's nice that parking seems easier here than across the street at the Yard.",

    "text": "To be fair, I've never been one to get too excited over gastropub-style restaurants. There's already too damned many of them in Phoenix as it is - making it incredibly hard to really stand out. I think Stock and Stable makes a solid effort at trying to pull it off, but I'm not quite sure if the food is memorable enough to be called anything special.  What we have here is a highly stylized restaurant that offers a rotating menu. Yelp pictures might be misleading, as certain items, such as the Noble rolls that I saw pictured, were not available during our particular visit. That's okay though, as there were still plenty of things that we could try.  Philly cheesesteak eggrolls were interesting, although this was more along the lines of ground beef and cheese than what I'd call cheesesteak. Their salumi board, which you can obtain for five dollars less during happy hour, was a nice creative effort, filled with all kinds of meats, cheese, and the always delicious Noble bread.  For fear of going overboard, my girlfriend and I simply split a Cubano sandwich with fries, as well as a side of street corn. Neither of us were fans of the corn, which included onions, which kind of mucks up the flavor a bit too much. The fries were very crispy - some might say even too crispy, while the sandwich was a decent enough take that I'd probably recommend to others.  For dessert, we opted for their German chocolate cake, which was brought out within a matter of minutes and served warm. My girlfriend compared it to the texture of a lava cake (sans the lava). It was okay, but kind of forgettable.  Money wise, the food here is a little pricier than I originally expected - especially considering we skimped on our order by splitting one main course between two people. On the plus side, our server was very friendly and positive, checking up on us regularly.  Don't get me wrong. The food here is by no means bad. It's just really hard to differentiate it from all of the other gastropubs in Phoenix serving similar food at similar prices in similar settings.  Seen it. Done it. Over it.  But if this style of food is your thing, you're bound to have a grand ole' time here. Although it might not be for everyone, I think they're at least worth a try.",

For us who enjoy the company of animals and prefer not to snack on them I tell ya to stay away. The options are very limited to vegetarians and even more so vegans.   Pros: -Waiter offered to make me a mocktail since I am pregnant. First waiter to do that, all others just offer me water/tea/soda.  -Hummus had a great consistency and loved the oil and herbs that topped it. I didn't however enjoy the pita, it was cooked to be pita chips some areas were burnt. I would have preferred soft pita.  -Favorite thing about this entire place is there dessert. LEMON bars are to die for...and just the perfect portion.   Cons: -Limited menu for vegetarians -Cesar salad was dry and the dressing seemed odd when I ordered a side of it.  -Street corn was good but they covered it in an avocado paste that seemed artificial and was just too much.",

    "text": "This is a hidden/tucked-away gem of Phoenix, definitely perfect for a date night. I booked a table for us two on OpenTable and surprisingly they had fairly open availability on a Saturday night. He picked out the spot and so glad he did- it was probably one of the best meals I've ever eaten in the Valley. And the romantic decor/restaurant layout made it better. Like a well-decorated basement of a multi-level home that opens to the great outdoors. I looked ahead of time online to peruse the menu and discovered they had recently changed their menu. A few things I was hoping to try disappeared!   The staff were nice, but a little space-headed unfortunately. It probably was a good 10-15 minutes before our waiter came by the table, greeted us and served us water. At this point we both knew to order food and drinks at the same time (and to err on the side of caution if they kept forgetting about us). We wanted elote first (a staple in our dining if possible) and we probably could've eaten two sides of it- absolutely delicious. It came out with our main dishes though and drinks which was a little odd/surprising. And the drinks came out with dinner which didn't make sense at all. Perhaps it was an off night for service for the restaurant. My gin drink was good, but not really worth the $12. The lavender ice cube was cute though.  I saw stroganoff and my heart skipped a beat because not many places offer that on their menu. The flavors reminded me of a childhood recipe, amplified x1000. Umami, rich and filling- do not pass on ordering this if it's available. His short rib and potatoes were good, but not nearly as good as my main plate. As we winded down our main meals, a few of the desserts passed by and we went with the cheesecake. I'm not a huge fancy cheesecake fan (my go to at The Factory is vanilla) but this had me wrapped around its finger.   Definitely worth coming back for another fun date night. If you stay later, ask your server to take you upstairs the back way to Honor Amongst Thieves.",

The servers were friendly and attentive throughout the evening & helped us out with recommendations / questions.  The 4 of us started off with the Crab Cakes. I actually hadn't checked any photos or reviews on Yelp prior to us dining here, so I'm not sure if it has been mentioned; this appetizer actually only comes with a single crab cake. For 4 people, it probably wasn't the best choice. The Crab Cake itself, however was good, it was crunchy & flavorful. I personally thought the red curry was a bit too spicy with the crab but others liked it.  For entrees, I got the Butter Butt Chicken (with whipped potatoes), my mother in law got the Pork Chops (with ricotta, spinach, pomodoro), and my husband & his dad got the special which was a filet with potato on bottom (I can't remember exactly what it was called). The chicken was super tender & juicy and fell right off the bone, I ate all of it! I wasn't a huge fan of the whipped potatoes as they were a little bland. Everyone else also enjoyed their meals! They were a good size & filling.  Birthday's can't be complete without some dessert! We split the cheesecake & chocolate brownie with ice cream. Again both were good, the brownie was super chocolate-y & rich and the cheesecake was soft and fluffy. Overall, an enjoyable experience for dinner. I would return to try out other menu options!",

The main entrees were decent- nothing extremely memorable. The portions seemed too small as my date and I both were not full after eating both pasta dishes.

Overall, I would have given stock and stable a 4/5 for food and ambience, but I am taking off a star for service.   SERVICE: Their service was so slow. One waiter asked us 2 different times if he could get us anything (once I asked for large plates to share, and the next time I asked for the dessert menu). Both times, he did not follow through and we ended up having to ask another waiter walking around. We had to wait a long time for the dessert menu but luckily that brownie made up for everything and was to die for!)",

It was way too sweet for the dish. I ended up eating so much apps, I didn't really have room for entree.  Which I'm not upset about because my short ribs with mash was not that great. The ribs were stringy and the mash was dry. The other entrees seemed really great tho. Especially the salmon.  You would think that I couldn't fit dessert but i couldn't resist sharing the brownie and cheesecake. The brownie was warm and yummy. The cheesecake was too dense and difficult to finish.  Overall, cute spot with great plates for sharing",

Never having been here before, it was exciting to decide on what to eat and drink. The golden heart was so delicious. The philly egg rolls were not what I was expecting. It was way better than I ever thought they would be. My short rib with fingerling potatoes was perfection. Cut it with a fork. Hubby had the Stroganoff and the bite I had was superb. He sure did finished it to the last drop.   They were on the AZ Restaurant Week menu and it was awesome.   We can not wait to return.

    "text": "(Lyrics - Joan Jett - I Love Rock N' Roll)  I kept on staring there right down by 7th Street I knew I must a been a foodie scene The drinks were coming strong Yelping my favorite songs  And I could tell it wouldn't be long Till I would try  it, Yelp it And I could tell it wouldn't be long Till I I would try it, Yelp it, singing  I love Stock and Stable So put another bite in my palate, baby I love Stock and Stable So come and bring your appetite and eat with me  Stock & Stable has a nice vibe and view.  I've been eyeing this place from the road every time I pass and finally just gave in to check them out!  A lot of wood as I recall and not a bad thing.  Almost vintage to some point, but wood....    We started out with some cocktails and to my surprise they have a bar upstairs.  A some what of a speak easy of sorts since you have to be brought up by your server.  Definitely something I gotta check out next time.    For our food we started with their Pork Belly Buns; pork belly marinated in a sort of Korean BBQ sauce with pickles and sprouts.  Served like a triplet of tacos, I would say you should eat quickly so that the sauce doesn't make the buns soggy.  Moreover, the bun was sweet and sour because of the BBQ while the pickle provided a much needed texture.  I would say another element of texture would have been nice like cabbage or something.  For our entree I ordered the Bolognese and my partner went for their Linguine.  I really enjoyed my pasta dish since it was large flat noodles which paired well with the meat sauce.  I was able to scoop up both was ease and lay some on my toast it came along with.  The sauce itself was thick and slightly sweet, but just perfect to my palate.  The Linguine my partner said was good, but was a lot of broth and little substance.  She brought some broth home just to finish off with some bread.   In the end, Stock and Stable is located in the heart of PHX's next restaurant hot bed.  It's definitely worth the visit for drinks and a revisit for me to check out the \"upstairs\" bar! - Enjoy!",

The Salumi Board was really good but that is where it ended. I tried the Stroganoff and was less than enthused.

    "text": "After getting a few recommendations from friends, my boyfriend and I finally tried Stock & Stable and it happened to be Restaurant Week! We totally forgot that was going on, so that was really lucky :)  For the starters, we chose the Kung Pao Cauliflower and the Frutti Di Mare. Even if you're not a fan of cauliflower, I highly recommend the Kung Pao! We both loved it; the sauce was delicious and so were all the toppings. I don't like cauliflower that much, and I've had cauliflower nachos at other places where it's like, \"okay, this is still just cauliflower with a tiny bit more flavor...\" lol, but this one is really crispy and is a great sub for meat. The Frutti Di Mare was awesome too; the bread was a bit charred for my taste but the seafood was pretty tasty!   Then, for dinner, we did the Beer Butt Chicken and the Short Rib. I thought both were good; I'm not super into the \"homestyle\" type of foods as much and that's more what they were. Still, I loved the fingerling potatoes that were served with the short rib and everything was well-made and great quality! :)  Dessert with Restaurant Week were Cheesecake Bites - one regular cheesecake covered in chocolate, and one pumpkin cheesecake covered in white chocolate. Those were delicious! I think we'll for sure go back here again. The inside is also beautiful and a lovely place to be when it's nice out and they have the windows open!",

For the first course, we got the cauliflower dish which was unbelievable, the frutti de mare, and I got the arugula salad. All were delicious - and very filling. When we finished course one I was already worried I wouldn't have room for the entree. My two friends got the beer butt chicken and I got the salmon. Both were incredible, especially the chicken. It was super juicy and the seasoning was insane. The salmon was also delicious, one of the best salmon dishes I've had.  For dessert, we asked for a to-go container and ended up enjoying the chocolate cake at a later time.  I believe all the items we got are on the regular (non restaurant week) menu. This place is definitely on the pricey side, but if you are willing to splurge a bit you definitely won't be sorry. The service is also excellent, and the patio is super comfy.",

Good/not bad orders: rib eye (10 oz, tasted like beef teriyaki), short ribs, chicken and mint salad, ny strip (came with a weird spicy green sauce on the side that was kind of unnecessary), side of mashed potatoes (smaller than you would think, but it's pretty rich/creamy/cheesy so it's satisfying. Just overpriced), brussels sprouts.  Less good orders: The fish of the day (Chilean sea bass) was overcooked and a little tough on the outside. Also its description includes baby clams and shrimp, but I think it's pureed into tomato sauce because there were definitely no clams or shrimps on my plate. The Caesar salad was overpriced, the only good thing is that it comes with avocado toast. Would recommend the chicken and mint salad over it.   It looks like this place has good happy hour deals that would make it worth coming here, but otherwise I think I could find food that tastes just as good for a better price elsewhere.",

Fritto misto is served ceviche style and is nice and light. Farfalle pasta is homemade, good flavor, although least favorite of all the things we ordered. The crispy chicken sandwich is really good as well, good breading, not too heavy, and good kick from the hot sauce. Definitely will be back!",

I love coming here for a quick happy hour (Monday-Friday 3-6pm) featuring $3 craft cocktails, $5 well drinks, select wines, and beers as well as half off appetizers. I personally love the Busty Lou {Absolut Vodka | Pampelmousse | Fresh Lemon Juice | Champagne} let's be real, anything with champagne is going to be great! A must order appetizer is the kung pow cauliflower with cashews, cilantro, and bell peppers- I don't know what it is about it but its a fabulous flavor explosion in your mouth. Most recently I ordered the burrata and tomato appetizer and my server was kind enough to remind me that the tomato is a jam that is spread on the toast and not an actual tomato. Yes, it is stated on the menu but I definitely missed it and it's always nice to have servers who look out for their customers (however illiterate we may be!) The presentation was great and the creamy burrata was fresh and delicious. I will continue to come here and encourage you to as well!",

    "text": "This review reminds me of a Date-  Stock & Stable being a really Hot Guy you've heard some positive things about and he definitely Looks intriguing, but upon Actually going out with the guy you realize he's really nothing substantial under the surface!! And dang it you really wanted to like him!! Such is the case with Stock & Stable. Heard raves but the minute I stepped in the door it began to under impress. Hostesses were lackluster in their welcome while I stood waiting for a table to clear they made no effort to engage in conversation. The atmosphere was cool and had interesting details but you need to be able to hear your conversation. The restaurant isn't very well designed for buffering the noise- like a garage, the noise may not be bad when it's quiet but it was Friday so it was difficult to hear each other across our table!  The food was interesting...most lacking the punch of what I have experienced elsewhere. Nice presentation on some meals but again nothing that Wowed me! I guess I may have been more excited about the experience if our server would have been more passionate about the menu and making his suggestions. Our meals weren't disappointing or bad but in this area restaurant competition is Tough and this establishment just isn't on point- perhaps they are still finding their groove. The pasta we shared was lovely but left my tastebuds disinterested. My Cuban sandwich was pleasant enough with the sweet pickle for contrast. My fiance had a burger that looks wonderful but it was greasy. My cocktail was delicious though.  Again, genuinely bummed that we didn't hit it out of the park in this one cause I was super excited to check it out for Date Nights! With so many other interesting places to try I just don't know if I will be going back because we both left thinking...Marginal. And what's up with no Salt & Pepper?? We chuckled that maybe that would have Saved this review...our Tastebuds need coffee to wake up from their nap.  Also, servers- you are an important factor of the evening! Your guidance, passion for the food and welcoming pleasant manner can determine the evening for customers. Perhaps if you were more engaging I would have enjoyed the evening more who knows?? If you follow my reviews you will see I'm usually very generous with stars- and I wanna be kind but 2 was all I could give 3 just seemed over generous.",

    "text": "First of all, I'll be clear - I'm not in to writing reviews everywhere I go... it's usually done if it's really good or really bad - or more importantly - 'memorable' in some way...  So Traci and I (who eat in the nearby Arcadia area 4-5 nights a week) decide to try a place that has clearly been on our radar, has the buzz and been open a while.  It's hopefully found it's mojo, and should be 'singing' by now - as they opened in (approx) October of 2016.  Today is March of 2017 and it's a Thursday.  So how do they do?  Traci and I sit at the bar for dinner and here we go...  We're greeted by Jackie and the entire bartend staff (who clearly share the guests for quick and prompt service) and has immediately made an impression:   knowledgeable, warm and comforting with a clear awareness of everything on the drink and food menu....  Already off to a good start...  We get a couple cocktails as we watch them being made - clearly hand-crafted with a little extra effort... love it... already impressed.  Traci had the Stock and Stable Whiskey Sour and I had the 'Remember the Maine' (unbelievable, look on the menu for ingredients).  Life is good...  On to dinner... we start with the brussel sprouts (honey butter, pickled crasins, breadcrumbs with a drizzle of balsamic) - and as you all know - they can be 'great', 'good' or 'no thank-you' - depending on how they're prepared.   These were charred to perfection and amazing.  Well done!  Traci got the braised short rib for dinner and I got the beer butt chicken.  Both were fabulous - nicely prepared and 'fresh'.  Not warmed from the day before.  They truly had a 'prepared for you' TODAY feeling.  Continuing the good experience....  We passed on desert.  But Jackie made us aware of the SpeakEasy upstairs and after settling up with our tab, she personally assisted us to the the very cool upstairs bar for a nightcap.  Walked up the stairs, found a place at the bar and Ryan greeted us with thanks, appreciation and a genuine appreciation for our business.   I asked him for his recommendation for a good 'brown liquor' night-cap drink and without flinching - made us a couple unbelievable Manhattan-style drinks.  Sometimes you just have to trust the good time you're having and have the wait-staff use their experience to impress, comfort and make you happy.   These guys delivered.  Unbelievable evening!  Would not have changed a thing!  Although the amazing 7th Street restaurant corridor is loaded with great options - you owe it to yourself to give this place a try and follow our lead.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!  It is truly a 5 star experience!  Have a good time and CHEERS!  Bo",

It's so nice here Arizona that I find myself always asking for outdoor seating when I'm here. The main dining area is absolutely stunning. It's spacious and warm. Now, let's get to the food. I was lucky to try some of their new dishes recently. Please refer to my photos. All dishes were delightful and well seasoned. Their cocktails were exquisite to look at and enticing to the taste buds. For appetizers, I highly recommend the Kung Pao Cauliflower and the Philadelphia Cheesesteak Egg Rolls. I loved the Yellowtail as my main dish, while hubby adored the Beer Butt Chicken. It's a win win no matter what. This is a pretty casual cool date night spot for sure. If you haven't been here, I highly suggest you add it to your to do list. Until the next review, stay hungry everyone!!",

This place reminds me of restaurants that I've been to in San Fransico and Chicago, the food was fantastic. I had the pork chop which was delicious and I also had part of the New York strip which was also amazing. The ambience is something special, it's elegant but comfortable and so many details went into the interior. They also have a great patio and they have a very chic upstairs lounge. The service was exceptional and the staff was very well-trained on the menu. I expect this to be a big hit once it opens to the public on Friday.",

I ordered the crab benedict, she ordered the Belgian waffles. Drinks? Yes, I got the port of call and she got the eastern prayer (prob messing up the names, but you'll know which ones I mean). Anyway, my benedict was terrific! Lots of crab and shrimp with poached egg, hollandaise all over toast. I asked for Frank's red hot on the side, which I recommend if you want a kick. Her Belgian waffles were good, I tried them...a tad dry, but fresh blackberries were a nice touch. My drink was outstanding, I highly recommend during the summer. It was very refreshing, I could have had 2-3 more. I tried hers...it tastes like a spiked Thai iced tea, so yeah. Decor is homey, comfortable, what you'd expect from a trendy new spot in midtown. For my money, I'd hit up Daily Dose or Ocotillo before I went to S&S again. But I'll prob be back for dinner at some point.",

We went just for drinks on Saturday and had a few of the bees knees and their version of a Moscow mule. Very refreshing, and I'm sure we'll be visiting again and again!",

The pork chop was cooked perfectly and the salad was very flavorful.  For dessert we had the chocolate peanut butter mouse. We would have liked it fluffier and more airy with more peanut butter flavor, but never the less it was delicious. We will be back for sure. I am hoping for a perfect chocolate martini with my next meal.",

    "text": "7 of us went to have Brunch on a Saturday at Stock and Stable on 7th Street. Since this is a new restaurant we decided to forgo our favorite Brunch stops and try out Stock and Stable. When we arrived there was one table outside and one table occupied inside. The service was slow and it took a while to get our drink order of Bloody Mary's. The Bloody Mary's came with a  1/2 of sausage link and a lime in a low ball glass. Not what I was expecting but they were good and spicy. For Brunch I ordered the Steak and Eggs and the Steak to be cooked at Medium and the Eggs over Medium. When my plate arrived the Steak was Rare and the Eggs were runny. I will occasionally eat a rare Steak if the flavor is good and the meat is tender, however there wasn't any flavor and the Steak was a little tough. Not what I was expecting from a Restaurant called Stock and Stable and the decor showing Cows. Speaking of the Decor the Blue tile surrounding the Bar looked awesome. A few other dishes that were not up to par were the Croque Madame and Biscuits and Gravy. The Croque Madame didn't have enough Pork Shoulder in the middle of the two pieces of thick bread and the Biscuits from the Biscuits and Gravy plate were dry even the gravy couldn't help. I understand that when a new restaurant opens up there are a few things that can improve but the food should come out of the kitchen with no flaws.  Maybe I may return to this Restaurant when it has been open for a while. Maybe...",

If you are planning to talk in this restaurant, it is very hard to hear. We ordered the beet salad which was great. And then ordered the cauliflower which was ok. I thought it would be better. The male server with stubble on his face was non personable at all. I noticed other wait staff being extra friendly and outgoing.He didn't really go over the menu, explain the concept or give any suggestions. I asked about a non sweet vodka drink and he showed me a drink that had Gin. I asked if he could swap Gin with Vodka and he said no. He said they have a full bar, which I could obviously see. But, wanted to try one of their signature cocktails. I ordered the pork chop which was good. Another person ordered the steak which was ok, a bit fatty. Overall it was ok. Would I come back? Not sure.",

The wine selection was not familiar but she was helpful in explaining things  and there was a cool list of cocktails. They need really more options or at least more flexibility with their dishes. Ie: shrimp cocktail is actually a multi seafood ceviche! Huh? And you can't just order a plain shrimp cocktail. The $24 meat/cheese board cannot be sold as just a cheese board. Why not? We did not want salami and sausage. Some cocktails can only be sold as pitchers, not singles. Several time we heard \"sorry, it's pre-mixed,\" or \"sorry, the chef can't do that.\" Everything was fine, nothing amazing but fine. My companions and I said we would try it again in a month or so with the hope that they have tweaked the menu. There are too many other places that have more options, especially for vegetarians. I'd probably give it an extra half star if that was an option but it's not a 4.",

The first time I dined there with friends, the service was horrible.  One of them had a dairy allergy which he advised the server about when he ordered. Later he asked about the fries and she told him there was parmesan cheese on them.  This really alarmed him and he reminded her that he has a dairy allergy and asked her to confirm whether they put parmesan on the fries.  Instead of being helpful, the server gave him a dirty look and walked away.  We had to seek the chef ourselves.    Unfortunately, the service was horribly slow last night.  The restaurant wasn't that busy.  Server was nice, but very slow and needs training. We waited a long time for our cocktails.  Then we waited a long time for him to take our food order.  When food was served, we were missing a napkin and silverware, but server never brought one and we had to go get one from another table.  The server never checked back to ensure our food was okay.  One of our diners ordered her food to go and asked for a separate check.  Server never brought her check and so she finally had to leave and we covered her portion.  I think this place needs to change its management if it hopes to survive.  The server that we had last night needs training and the server from the first experience needs to be replaced.",

    "text": "We dined here tonight and had an awful experience. For starters we are in the restaurant industry so we are very understanding, and we especially understand how customer service is supposed to be handled. We ordered our apps and received them after we put our entrees in. Our appetizers tasted spoiled rotten to the point we had to spit it out. This was our first dining experience and having such a bad experience with our starters made us feel concerned about how our entrees would taste. Mind you, all of this tasting of the appetizers happened right after we took our order. We were so disgusted we didn't want to eat any other food for the potential risk of receiving our entrees which would contain similar ingredients our appetizers consisted of and did not want to risk having to feel displeased nor waste any food. Instantly we tried to notify our server because we didn't want the food to be prepared and wasted. We couldn't see her so we grabbed the first person we could find and let him know we needed to cancel our order before it was started. We let them know it's nothing they did personally, we however would like to cancel our order. Our server then came out afterwards and confirmed we needed to cancel our orders and we apologized for any inconvenience. We would like to mention we felt embarrassed for even having to do this because it is an uncomfortable situation to be in. After this situation happened, next the gentleman we notified of our issues and decided to come back to our table and inform us he was thankful we cancelled our order because he was thankful he could order it because \"it was awesome\". His comment was very rude, passive aggressive, and unnecessary. We already felt rude for having to cancel and the comment he left was very unprofessional. I spoke with the manager on shift and he was very kind. This team needs to learn how to give proper customer service because how situations are handled truly influence whether or not we would return, and as of now we will not return nor recommend this place.",

Who knows...we'll let them get settled and consider a brunch in the future.",

I love intriguing drinks and this one topped the chart. We arrived just in time to order the deviled egg dip, it was decent, needed a touch more flavor, as in salt or even mustard. We also shared the basic brisket cheeseburger and cauliflower appetizer, both were outstanding. The brisket burger had a ton of flavor, the french fries on the side were cooked to perfection. We will be back and I mean soon... like this weekend soon!",

I had the beef stroganaff and the wife the linguini. Friends grabbed the ribs. We all shared and it was amazing. Plus I work for a commercial pest control company and the kitchens we see are horrible. This one was spotless. We had reservations and sat at the table for 15 minutes before someone came by but once we told him dude gave us free shots to make up for it. Then went up stairs and enjoyed the music. This is my new go to In Phoenix. Thank you very much!",

    "text": "I have wanted to try Stock & Stable for quite some time. They have a nice patio and the weather was just right so I thought I would give it a try. They have a nice selection of drinks. The price seemed a bit on the pricey side but they were well crafted and tasted great. We started with the Kung Pao Cauliflower. It was excellent!   Next on to dinner. The Salmon was good. Descent portion cooked just right.   I also ordered a NY Strip and this is where it went wrong. The price is $36 just for the steak and they served me a vein end NY Strip. Not only was the 10oz portion very small when you add the chewy connective tissue in the middle of that steak it was absolutely awful. I would expect any restaurant with a name like theirs to serve quality meat. What made it worse was the chef sliced the steak as part of the presentation. So if they didn't know it was a garbage piece of meat when they put it on the grill they should have noticed it when they cut the steak. Honestly I can go to a national chain restaurant and get a better steak with a side and a salad for a lot less than the cost of the dog food I was served.  Overall this place is trendy. They have a nice atmosphere and the service was excellent. My only complaint is their menu is overpriced for the quality of food I would expect from an establishment such as this one. I don't mind paying for a quality meal but this certainly wasn't quality.",

    "text": "Wow wow wow!  Been talking about this place for a bit and finally decided tonight was the night. Wow what a great night. Only thing that could spoil it is thinking how lame I've been for not trying it sooner.   To start we had the lobster mac and cheese. So creamy and a slight hint of lemon. The only thing that could make this better is if they threw in a couple pieces of crusty bread to mop up the sauce with. Felt a sin to waste such cheesy creamy greatness.   On to dinner...I went with the braised short rib. So you know when you order food in a large group and you look across the table and notice someone's dish? That feeling of food envy that washes over you? Well this was that dish!  The blend of flavors was super and it was pretty to look at as well.  Order this!!  My friend got the New York strip. It was sooo yummy. Cooked perfect. He also went with the asparagus. I love asparagus any day but this dish was extra good. The smoke on the grill added just enough flavor to really set it off.   As if that wasn't enough I saw the dessert board and on it was \"affogato\". What is this I wondered?  Isn't gato equal to cat?  Hmm what kind of dessert has cat?  Turns out it's marscapone ice cream and you pour fresh French press coffee over. OH MY. Why isn't this on my breakfast menu?  The man the chocolate cake. It was so warm and gooey.   Oh wait, our server Arron was awesome for sure. Very knowledgeable about the food and attentive enough without being a pest.   I'll be back here for sure. Hardest part will be trying something new when what I ordered was the ultimate in goodness.",

The one with crab and shrimp had lots of real crab and large shrimp.

    "text": "Stock & Stable is an American Gastropub. They offer New American Cuisine that slants Italian on some of the offerings. The dining room is elegant and masculine with lots of dark wood and leather. There are many portraits of cows. It looks sort of steakhouse like to me. They also offer a large bar, traditional tables, benches, high tops and patio dining.   We started out by sharing the Fermented Beets. The red and golden beets were very tasty and were tossed in an almond butter dressing along with crunchy fried goat cheese curds and lots of very crisp carrot ribbons. It was delicious all together. The carrots were raw but hard and crispy like maybe they were soaked in ice water and were just texture for the salad.  I had the Tuna Sandwich. It's enormous! (prepare to share or to take half home) It's very elevated tuna that's incredibly DELICIOUS and Spicy!!!!!!!!!!! THIS SANDWICH IS NOT your mom's tuna. THIS SANDWICH IS NOT FOR THE FAINT of heart.  They serve the tuna on what taste like thick sliced grilled Noble Bread. They add muenster cheese and Calabrian Aioli. It messy and full of lots of flavors! There are a lot of flavors going on. Really delicious and one of the best sandwiches I tasted all year! I picked the mixed green salad over the frites. They offer this Calabrian Vinaigrette that also is absolutely delicious and spicy. This plate is not for the masses. Really delicious and spicy!  The No Baloney (Mortadella) Sandwich is just ok and not as elevated as the tuna sandwich. The sandwich we got was like sliced lunch meat that was lightly grilled on both sides of the meat pile. It might have been more enjoyable if it was like a steak of mortadella that was caramelized on both sides. The sandwich is suppose to be spread with an unusual combination of maple mustard and chipotle herbed aioli. My husband asked for the sauces on the side. We both liked the taste of the chipotle herbed aioli but they seemed very strange together and we weren't sure about either flavor mixing with the mortadella. The sandwich came with tasty Frites that were nicely seasoned with fresh herbs and grated cheese.   Tried the Key Lime Pie for dessert. It had a nice tender delicate graham crust. The filling was creamy and a little limey. It was topped with a generous serving of fresh made real whipped cream.   Our server was friendly and efficient. He tried to get us to order the hamburger because they ground the beef in house and is a specialty here. I guess that explains the cow portraits.  Like from any other restaurant some things we liked better than other things.  3.5 stars rounded up because three out of four were winners!",

    "text": "I am torn between giving this place 3 stars or 4.  On the one hand, I really enjoyed the appetizers and dessert.  On the other hand, I did not enjoy my entree.  For appetizers, I got to try a little bit of a lot of them.  The hummus was great and I enjoyed the vegetables that accompanied the hummus.  There was the normal carrot and cucumber, but there were also some unusual vegetables tossed in there (like something that resembled a white carrot? and a purple carrot?)  The shisito roasted peppers were tasty, but 1 pepper was enough for me and it came with probably 15 in the appetizer so definitely make sure you have a large group to share those with.  The kung pao cauliflower was I think my favorite appetizer.  I would have liked for the cauliflower to be crispier, but it was still really tasty.    The philly steak egg rolls were alright, just tasted like meat inside of an egg roll wrapper.  It came with a cheesy sauce to dip that I didn't try.  For my entree I wanted to get shortribs, but since I can't eat dairy I wanted to substitute the side of mashed potatoes it came with for something that didn't have dairy.  The waiter told me that the \"chef respectfully declines to allow substitutions\".  He told me that they could leave the mashed potatoes off my plate and I could pay to order a different side if I wanted.... wow, what a great deal /sarcasm.  If they can leave the potatoes off and add a different side... why couldn't they just do that without charging me $6 more?!  Anyway, so I didn't get the short ribs and ordered the cod.  I liked the little clams that came with it and the crusty bread.  The red tomato sauce was entirely too salty.  I only ate a few bites of it.  The other entrees didn't look that impressive either.  My boyfriend said his burger and fries was only \"okay.\"  If I came back I would probably load up on appetizers as my meal and skip the entrees altogether.",

    "text": "I must admit I was a little hesitant to try out Stock and Stable at first. I'm not really sure why, I was just nervous that it would be another trendy hipster kind of spot with a great atmosphere but mediocre food. But boy was I proven wrong! My husband went for dinner on a Friday night and everything from the service to the dessert was absolutely lovely.  To start, we got the smoked corn manti - if this would have been a bigger portion, I could have had it for my meal. It was delicious! A little sweet from the corn, and little savory from the cheese, and a perfect way to start off our meal. My husband got the braised short rib for his main and had great things to say about it. The only downfall for him was the mashed potatoes. He said they didn't have much flavor, but the rest of his meal was on point.  I had the crispy chicken sandwich and I have been craving it literally every day since. It was AMAZING! Literally the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. The chicken was perfectly cooked and very crispy on the outside without falling apart, and the slaw on top was seriously to die for. I had zero complaints with my dish.  We ended with their salted caramel cheesecake, which is huge btw, and it was absolutely scrumptious. Here's the only downfalls from our experience with Stock and Stable:  I'm currently pregnant, so I ordered a cocktail off the menu and told our server about my \"condition\" so she made sure it was made with no alcohol. However, when I finished the first and ordered a second, the bartender made it with alcohol... I only found that out after having a drink of it. No bueno. Our server assured us she had told the bartender no alcohol, so who knows where the fault lies, but it's pretty darn important to make sure there's no alcohol in a mocktail for a pregnant woman, so it definitely should not have been overlooked.  The other issue is with the hostesses. I've been to Stock and Stable twice now, and both times the hotesses have barely even acknowledged us when we walk up. They just look at us and wait for us to say hello and how many are in our party. No smiles, no niceties, nothing. It's a pretty downer way to start a restaurant experience, so I highly suggest either training them up on how to greet people or hire new hostesses who know how to smile and act nice. It's a big turn-off.",

Would have loved to try the 8oz filet but wasn't up for spending $41 on it; it is a bit pricey ($80 for two) but considering we got (noble rolls, ricotta & pistachio, cubano sandwich, grilled cheese burger, apple pie, brownie + two cocktails) I don't view that overly priced. The ambience was more upscale than we normally visit, but the staff was extremely attentive & we never had to wonder \"where are they?\" because they were always asking if we need this or that. After a few bites of the apple pie, I realized it was cold. Took for a few more bites thinking it was some new fad I was clueless about but decided to ask the server anyway. He was very apologetic so yeah, it should have been hot (the brownie was piping hot & damn! was it good). I started to laugh, thinking nothing of it but he insisted on taking the price off our bill AND bringing me a hot one to take home. Which was very nice of him in theory but since it was cold by the time I got home ... well, whatevs. I appreciate the thought, though, and he gets an E for effort. If I have have a major life event worth celebrating & feel like like spending extravagantly on a meal, I will come back here for the filet for sure.",

Came here during restaurant week, so I was able to try several different things. I started off with the Kung pow cauliflower. This was fantastic. It's breaded and soaked in their Kung pow sauce and served with peppers. Honestly, from someone who hates cauliflower, you couldn't even tell it was a vegetable.   I ordered the beer butt chicken and my boyfriend ordered the pork Milanese meaning I ate both. The pork Milanese was like a chicken fried steak except fancier and you won't hate yourself afterwards for eating an entire one. The beer but chicken was so tender and moist, with a little crisp to the skin. Yum!! I also thought it came with a potato wedge, but I attempted to cut and bite into it, only to find out it was a lemon. Lest you not make the same mistake as me.  We ended with the chocolate cake and apple crisp. Honestly, you can't go wrong with either. Both are served warm and are really yummy! Lpl  A few downfalls, parking kind of sucks, especially on a busy Friday night.",

This is beautiful and had ample fans on the patio to keep us comfortable with the 90's temps. My friend ordered the biscuits & gravy and I ordered the Chicken and Waffle. Yum! Perfectly battered juicy fried chicken and they added some cinnamon to the waffle for a sweet kick.   $5 mimosas & bloody marys...hard to find those prices in this area of town and they didn't make the drinks weak either!   Glad we kind of stumbled across this gem...I'm excited to go for dinner next time!",

    "text": "We love it when we're \"mooved\" by a new restaurant with a great menu and has something to offer. You know we wouldn't want to \"steer\" you wrong. We expected the newly opened Stock & Stable in the hip, happening compound called The Colony on 7th Street to be serving up plenty of old fashioned meat 'n' potatoes kind of grub. It ain't necessarily so, pardner. There's more than meets the eye. And mouth.  Stock & Stable isn't the cow palace kind of steakhouse we were expecting despite the moniker, the bovine portraits adorning the wooden walls and the chic, modern, copper-ceiling tiled \"saloon\" feel it has. The name is a nod to the venerable, nearby Murphy Bridle path through the North Central Corridor. The smart, classy \"gastropub\" (a name that's bandied around way too much these days, much like the \"restobar\" of the early 2000's) is the incarnation of Chef Joe Absolor, formerly of The Clever Koi, Parlor and R&R.   We were pleasantly surprised at the variety of fine comestibles available. Stock & Stable goes beyond the \"chuckwagon\" fare you might be expecting with a name like that.   Consider starting with something from the \"Shared Plates\" offering. (You might not even want to share.) We tucked into the almost misleadingly labeled Pork n' Beans. There's no barbeque and it's nothing like the Van de Camp's you might be imagining. Served chilled, you get a generous plate of green beans, smoked onion cannellini bean puree, heirloom tomatos and guanciale--a slightly bacon-like cured pork jowl (of which we wish there were more.) A hint of mint in the dressing brings out a burst of summer flavor. $12  More light and fresh shareables like Fruit Cocktail, Frutti di Mare, Roasted Cauliflower and more tempt you to return.  The Baby Gem Salad is a miniature reimagining of the classic Wedge Salad with five fist-sized halves of sweet lettuce with a tomato confit, shoepeg corn, almonds, a cheddar-y shopshire blue cheese with buttermilk vinaigrette. A scattering of succulent pickled grapes will have you begging for more. $10.   There's more than \"meats\" the eye at Stock & Stable. Pasta! We opted for the housemade Farfalle with Schreiner's sausage, clams, shrimp, heirloom tomatoes and crispy artichoke. We loved it, but they skimped on the actual pasta. Crostini provided gives you a chance to sop up the tasty broth. $14  Five sandwiches make it hard to choose, but you can't go wrong with the Cubano. Two slices of country bread are stuffed with a mouth-watering, tender pork shoulder smoked on the premises. Pad it with mortadella, provolone cheese, Tony Packo's sweet-hot pickles (a to-die-for Ohio specialty that packs a punch. Get some at AJ's) and dressed with yellow mustard. The succulent pork is $14.   More sandwiches like the Turkey Bacon BLT, Grilled Cheesburger, Crispy Chicken and Tuna are also up for grabs. Each come with your choice of frites or side salad.  Big appetites will love the Double-Cut Pork Chop topped with a warm compote of roasted peaches for $19. The sweet and tender chops satisfied, but could've been a tad bigger. You can also Beer Butt Chicken, New York Steak, Swordfish or Trout.   The menu changes here and there according to seasonal bounty, so you'll want to check in from time to time. Our summer dessert pick was a tasty, housemade Peach Shortbread with Whipped Cream.   The \"fire water\" cocktails on the menu won't disappoint, but don't miss out on the \"secret\" Honor Amongst Thieves speakeasy upstairs after 6 p.m. for some boozy fun.   Stock & Stable offers late night options for night owls and weekend brunch. Feed 'n' supplies are locally sourced whenever possible from places like Noble Bread and Lux Central for pastries. Don't miss their Social Hour with treats like Chili Cheese Curds, Deviled Egg Dip, and Philly Grilled Cheese.   All in all, it's a right fine round-up at Stock & Stable.",

    "text": "We have been back several times since my review below, and have noticed changes they have made. It's been a good improvement and we are cautiously optimistic. I would give it 3 1/2 stars at this point.   OLD REVIEW:  Our several visits to Stock and Stable gain mixed reviews from us.  We have been there about 10 times. The food has been decent to very good. However, the last three visits have been unsatisfactory, and may be our last ones.  We brought a professional colleague to brunch a few weeks ago. When he placed his order, he asked them to hold the pesto and the cheese.  The server asked him if that was a personal preference or did he have an allergy. This is an inappropriate question when a customer asks for a specific accommodation. He responded that it was an allergy, but we are quite certain he would have preferred a little more privacy about that.  Today, we brought a group of 11 in for brunch and had pre-reserved a table for 13. They were seating us at a tall table, and we interrupted that to tell them that we needed accommodations, because three members of our group could not balance on higher chairs.  Although there were many places they could have seated us at a traditional height table, we had to get into a skirmish with them to accomplish our goal. The hostess remained rather sour toward us during our entire stay.  In these two instances, they definitely have demonstrated that they are not accommodating to people with limitations, which is rude, embarrassing, and I thought illegal. In any case, they had better step up their game. There are very many choices for great dining spots in the area, and they would be wise to remember that.",

Parking:  We arrived at 5:30 p.m. and there was plenty of parking in the huge lot behind the restaurant.  Did not see any valet service so not sure if that is available.  Service:  We were immediately sat at a table near the bar.  Our waiter (Matt) was excellent!  Other staff members that we came into contact with were very friendly.  Food:  I had the Double Cut Pork Chop.  There were two rib bones - everywhere else I've had a DCPC it has been only one - no big deal at all.  It was served with a mixture of peaches and onions on top.  My 'mental picture' when looking at the menu was one of having grilled peach halves on the plate beside the pork chop, with the pork chop showing the grill marks.  Although the presentation did not match my 'mental picture' - it was o.k. and very delicious.  The pork chop alone was $19.00 - would expect that there would be a side item included (don't really consider the peach/onion topping to be a side).  Ordered the Asparagus ($6.00) and the Frites ($6.00) as sides.  Had the Blackberry Tart ($6.00) for dessert - the crust was like a brick; you could not cut it with a fork or even a knife so I just ate the lemon custard & blackberries.  My friend had the Tuna Sandwich with Frites ($12.00) and he stated both were tasty.  I rated this experience as 3 stars instead of 4 as I'm not yet a 'fan' - while the service was great and the decor nice, just sort of feel that it was a bit over-priced for the food value received.  I'll give it another try and then update this review as needed.",

It looked small but was very filling. There was more prosciutto than expected and the flavors were in great. The ONLY issue- a benedict should come with a poached egg. This came with a (slightly) soft boiled egg. They are close but not the same thing. Poach it!!! I would recommend this place even though they don't know their eggs and I would even try it again!",

The \"shrimp cocktail\" has no cocktail sauce, which was more of a seafood salad... Which was also lacking seasoning.  Definitely not worth it if you're coming here for the food",

As far as the food; the shrimp cocktail was more like a flavorless ceviche, the steak in the dry side for a medium rare, flavor average.  The beet salad excellent; but suggest to incorporate more beets.  Good experience overall.  I am looking forward to return and see the improvement.",

    "text": "We are excited about the new restaurant row in our 7th and Missouri neighborhood and watch as each new restaurant builds and opens.  We have watched the Stock and Stable build and were anticipating the opportunity to try out this new offering.   We browsed the menu online and commented that the offerings are a very eclectic mix of smaller plates and sandwiches with 3 standard main plates.  We decided to try it out. Starting with drinks, the bar menu is very creative and the cottontail cocktail (I tend to favor scotch) was creative and refreshing.  The addition of the Thai chili was colorful but didn't seem to add the expected hint of heat. For starters we selected the Tongue Pastrami and the Squid Ink Cavatelli.  The pastrami was very flavorful though the meat felt to be over cooked and a bit of a paste, the Cavatelli, was rather bland.  The tongue was served with tasty homemade chips. We ordered a brisket cheeseburger and the Cuban sandwich for our mains, both where OK, neither remarkable. Service for the most part was perfunctory and cold, three servers helped us and with one exception did not appear to be happy or positive about their work or restaurant. The decor is a mix of period with modern touches, eclectic would be one word to describe the space, for us it matched the undefined, unfocused overall presentation.   The restaurant was very loud, and the acoustics presented the music as just large noise in the background. Perhaps this offering just wasn't' what we were looking for.  We shall see how this works out over time.",

We knew it was a Saturday afternoon/evening so we went online through their website and even made reservations. Then when we showed up they told us they were closed because someone bought out the restaurant for an event. We were both pretty disappointed especially because we made reservations and then drove from Tempe.  As much as I wanted to try it, I highly doubt I will go back. How will I know that I won't show up again just to be shoo-ed away. If you are thinking about going to this place, I would suggest calling ahead to make sure you can actually eat there....even if you make reservations.",

Last time they were out of desserts but this time they had them all so we got a the Key Lime tart and shared it.  Yummy!  My dinner date and I decided to walk upstairs and check out the bar after dinner and we were both very impressed with the space.  Will have to go check it out soon.  Keep up the good work but can you do something about the noise level?  LOL",

    "text": "When you walk into a hip, trendy and new restaurant you automatically discount that the food is going to be as good as the overall ambiance....not in this case! Stock & Stable crushed in all categories! First, you have to get one of their fantastic cocktails. Yes, they've got cool sound names, but the bartender backs it up with a solid concoction! Next, the appetizers tasted great and were not the same old same old. Definitely try the unique Philly cheese steak egg roll especially if you are eating with someone from Philly! The Brussel Sprouts are the it vegetable right now and these did not disappoint while I still thought I was eating something healthy. The beet appetizer was on point! Very original and extremely tasty. Side note a few people in our party thought a few of the dishes were salty. Next we got a nice bottle of red wine to go with our dinner. The fish special was phenomenal; the red broth was delicious and they use Noble bread which is a huge plus. Other people in our party got some other dishes which quiet honestly I don't recall as I was really into my food (and alcohol). Decided to skip desert and head upstairs to a lounge, yes a lounge in Cenpho! Definitely give Stock & Stable a try well worth the reasonable prices for high quality.",

I ordered the prosciutto benedict with a small french press coffee; my husband ordered the croque madam (french toast stuffed with pork and topped with a poached egg) and a specialty cocktail. Both our dishes and were decent tasting and relatively creative (for breakfast fare), but portions were small for the price of $11-12 for each of our dishes.  My husband downed his cocktail with glee but my french press coffee wasn't so good.  It kind of tasted like they may have re-used the press w/o fully removing the grounds from the previous use, and the coffee was only luke warm. Service was cheerful and attentive, and the restaurant appeared very clean despite it's large outdoor exposure.",
