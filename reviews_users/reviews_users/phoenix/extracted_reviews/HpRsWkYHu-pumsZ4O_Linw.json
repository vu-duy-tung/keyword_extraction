    "text": "We visited The Habit Burger Grill on a Friday night.  After reading Yelps that were ranging from 1 to 5 stars, I had no idea what to expect.    Parking was very limited and I was lucky to get a spot.  I'm not sure if it's because it's new, or it was Friday at 7pm.  So, in we go and it's pretty darn packed.  I was prepared to wait a lifetime.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  The menu is small, so we decided pretty quickly.  I had a mushroom swiss burger with bacon and my boyfriend had a charburger with cheese.  We also ordered regular fries & sweet potato fries.  We were handed a beeper, and went off to find a place to sit.  We found booth and prepared to wait.  Happily, that was only about 5 minutes.  Our beeper went off and we grabbed the food.  On a tray with the fries in a paper 'boat', our burger was wrapped up with one end sticking out for immediate consumption.  I would have liked a 'double wrap' so that one paper could serve as the 'plate' to hold the burger.    The burger patties were more substantial that Smash Burger or Five guys, the bun was toasted, and the ingredients were fresh & tasty.  The regular fries were better than the sweet potato fries.    The food was hot, fresh, and really tasty.  I will absolutely go back & try more.",

Nice Decor and it will be nice to enjoy the patio once it gets a bit cooler. My husband and I are big fans of Culver's so it will be tough to change our favorite fast food burger eatery but Habit came in at a close 2nd! Only complaint....it smelt really bad outside. I am guessing it was the dumpster but it was overwhelmingly smelly. Luckily, the smell of burgers and fries quickly filled the air!",

The first time I had a Tuna burger which was good but was craving a regular burger this time. I got there right at noon and it was already very crowded and I had to park down the street since the parking lot was full. No huge biggie....I have a very short wait and had the #1 Charburger with cheese, fries and a drink (combo meal). I found the last table open inside as it was a tad warm to sit outside and grabbed my drink. I only waited a few minutes before my pager was going off that my burger and fries were ready. The burger was great and the fries were too. I normally order crispy fries and this time I didn't. They were still very good but will order them crispy next time.  The staff was extremely friendly and the restaurant was very clean. I know I will be back again for lunch!",

The Habit kind of meets you halfway as far as fast food is conserned. It's definitely a fast food burger but with a little gourmet flair.   I like the way the place is set up. Kind of like a Culver's or something with those buzzy pager things that notify you when your oder is ready.   The burger was actually good as was the bacon I ordered on top. My son ate all his food. Chicken I thinks. Also they gave him strawberry milk and a free refil before we left.   Over all a nice experience. I am not dying to eat here again but I am also not opposed.",

Fair prices for quality food. 6. Convenient location.  7. Fresh ingredients combined in a delicious way.  My favorites: mushroom swiss burger in lettuce wrap plus bacon! Cobb salad is big and fresh. You can eat at least kind of paleo-style at this place without much effort. I've eaten there many times and never feel lousy afterward when I choose carefully!",

The place itself is kind of small, not great for a big group & it can get very busy with no where to sit during peak times.  The workers are so helpful & actually seem happy to be working which is hard to find.  Prices were great! I LOVED that you could get an order of  1/2 fries &  1/2 onion rings.  The burgers are so fresh & flavorful & the fries/rings have always been hot & crispy.  I wish this was closer to us as I would definitely be frequenting The Habit MUCH more.",

Habit not only does these things but does them EVERY time.  The Habit has to be the best chain fast food burger spot in AZ.  Many chains come with hopes and dreams of being the next best thing and they usually start out great and then quickly fall to pieces.  Not only has Habit delivered but their fries are much better than some of the better burger chains out there.  I also like the fact they have a good selection of drinks, a bar with jalapenos, peppers, and chiles.    If they could open a few more spots in the valley I would be all for it.  Great work!",

After making the always difficult decision of what to eat for lunch, I couldn't get the thought of a juicy, flavorful burger out of my mind. So after ordering my typical Teriyaki Burger, med-rare, sans onions and waiting the ever long wait time of five-ish minutes. I was shocked to see a sandwich that looked nothing like the burger I had envisioned just minutes earlier.   The look on my face, dumbfounded and deflated, must have been the clue to the lady presenting me with this meal that something was not right. After explaining to her that I thought I had ordered the Teriyaki Burger, she apologetically took the sandwich back. After reordering my burger, said I could take the Tri-tips sandwich home and try it. On top of that, since it cost more than the burger, she tried to force a free sandwich coupon my way. Who does she think I am? I refused of course! You can't buy my integrity with free food! No way!    Of course I'll be back and continue to eat their delicious burgers. Maybe even the occasional Tri-tips sandwich depending on how good this one tastes for dinner.   Thank you management and staff for a great meal and service at a great price!",

The chicken filet is at best, 1/4\" thick. The XL sized bun overwhelmed it. I don't know why a restaurants would be so skimpy with chicken. The Habit charges a large premium for a chicken sandwich over a burger but I doubt it's any more expensive to procure than hamburger. And the wheat bun was burned. I won't order it again. Chick-Fil-A chicken sandwiches give you 3 times as much protein for a lower price !",

On the fries they need to take a lesson from Smashburger--their smash fries are really, really good.   The cooks made a mistake on one of the burgers and management more than made up for it.

The fish was very underwhelming, which is perhaps why it comes with a sweet sauce, such as Teriyaki. There was no indoor seating available due to the slow turnover of tables, and by the time I returned home, the bun was a bit soggy. Even though it was the standard lunch hour at the time of my patronizing the restaurant, I consider it unacceptable for a restaurant of this style to not be able to accommodate its customer volume with seating. Based on my experience today, I will not return to The Habit.",

    "text": "1st time trying The Habit Burger Grill out. I received a mailer in the mail promoting a free sandwich. This week highlighted the grilled chicken whic is perfect because I don't eat red meat.  The Resturant is a cute modern style establishment. Hip music playing when you walk into the small dining area that includes outside patio service. The establishment is very clean and organized.  I came during lunch hour so it was busy. Limited parking and a long line that went fast. I decided to take my order to go. I have say I was not greeted when I walked in which could because the Resturant was slammed. There is a trendy virtual menu to look at while waiting in line. The cashier noticed my coupon and said \"there are many steps to this sandwich order.\" Then she asked me questions on what I did and did not want. It was confusing because I did not see these options on the virtual menu like Smashburger. I also felt rushed. See at Smashburger they always ask you if this is your first time dining at the Resturant. Then they welcome you or they thank you for returning. I added onion rings to my order and that was it.   The wait time was not long. They give buzzers to their guest so you know when your food is prepared. I feel it takes that personal touch away. At Smashburger your assigned a number then your food is delivered to you. This is for dine in. Takeout they walk the food over to you. I checked my order to make sure my food was accurate. My sandwich was prepared wrong. I asked for no cheese and they put it on there by accident. My sandwhich was quickly remade as the grilled chicken is already prepared. They just pull it out of a silver heated container and reheat the meat. There was never an apology. I was just ignored and told to wait.  I got home to indulge and noticed I was not given any napkins or condiments. My food was nicely wrapped which helped it stay warm. My chicken sandwhich had a nice presentation garnished with lettuce and an orange slice. My sandwich bread was soaked in butter. I like the type of bread but way to much butter. The chicken and veggies were good. My onion rings were good as well. They were not salty or to greasy. I have to say it was not bad but I am all about customer service and a great experience. I may try them again but I am not in a hurry. Smashburger has sold me since the very first time I walked through there doors. I have been to three in the valley and have had the same great experience at each location. Which is why I now eat there at least 2-4 times a week.",

Having been disappointed by some of the other hamburger chains that have come in here in the last few years with much fanfare from people that came from the same towns I was worried that a hamburger from my own home town might be a let down from either a taste or value stand point.  I need not have worried.  I took a friend with me and we each had a mushroom swiss  burger and I had onion rings and she had sweet potato fries.  We both liked the food.  2 burgers, 2 drinks, fries and onion rings were under $19 incl tax.  And being a lovely day we found a spot on the patio and camped out for over an hour.  The staff was friendly and close to being too attentive.  Parking sucks.  Even after the original opening hype they are still packed for a Sunday lunch so they must be doing something right.  I know I will return.",

I would say that I might have a Habit problem since I eat here about 4 times a week.   Think of Habit as the love child from an orgy between In-n-Out, Five Guys, and Smashburger, but cheaper and more delicious. It is from California like INO, it has many topping choices like Five Guys, and it has other non burger options like Smashburger (although, no alcohol unfortunately).  I've had almost everything on the menu, and I highly recommend the Swiss Mushroom Char and the Albacore Tuna Sandwich. The Sweet Potato Fries are very good. I would actually say that they are better than anything I've had at more expensive burger joints (*cough* that means step up your game, delux and FEZ *cough*).  The malts and milkshakes are pretty good also. I haven't tried requesting anything crazy like a Neapolitan shake, but I don't doubt that they would make that for me.   All in all, this is a great regular spot because it is cheap and consistently delicious. And consistency is a very rare quality to find in these kind of fast food-like restaurants.",

For about the same price at The Habit that you might spend at one of the other guys, the food is just so much better.  Grilled burgers the way a burger shoud be prepared.  I ordered the Teriyiki char-burger.  It had a teriyaki glaze, Grilled pineapple, mayonnaise, pickle, swiss cheese,fresh tomato, lettuce and caramelized onions on a toasted bun. Sooooo good and I think it costs $3.69.  I also ordered a side order of Tempura Green Beans. Fresh-cut green beans lightly battered and flash fried to perfection. I honestly am not a big fan of green beans but you MUST try these.  This is how green beans should be prepared.  The staff was super friendly and at one point someone came to our table to make sure everything was ok.  It you have not tried The habit Burger Grill, what are you waiting for?",

The burger was really good and juicy and reminded me a lot of Fatburger in both presentation and taste. The shake was also pretty good - says right on the side that they use real ice cream. It wasn't very strong in coffee flavour, though, and had no real coffee in it (that would be something to entice me to order it again). The fries were good but far from the best sweet potato fries I've had. There was hardly any seasoning. They should try battering or glazing them to make them stand out. They were much tastier than their regular fries, though - those were limp, tasteless and boring.   It was a decent meal and fun to try but I'm not sure if it was worth the $10+ dollars I spent.",

Last time we came in we noticed a new manager and new staff. I could tell things weren't running quite smoothly. Sure enough when we took our order home there were items missing so I wrote a review to that effect, but I don't believe it posted at the time.  Today we came in again to find the same manager and crew and it took forever to get the order completed with the cashier. She would stop to keep asking other staff about the items we were ordering. The person behind us came up to another cashier and was able to get his order completed quickly. Then when we were picking up our order \"to go\" and we were almost given our food and then the girl realize none of our french fries or green beans were in the bag (which is now what I remember happening the previous visit). While we were sitting waiting for order to be called we notice the manager in the back frantically cooking orders, whereas the previous manager used to walk around friendly greeting guests and checking on the cleanliness of the operation. I guess im questioning the qualifications and ability of the staff as they have been here a while and should have it worked out by now. Does corporate not train or check in on these guys. Terrible representation if what used to be a swift and fun experience. I know for one I'm gonna be going down to McDowell location from now on to give it a try until this is fixed. (Spent $45 tonight and No Ranch dip for the tempura green beans)",

I was a little surprised that they wanted payment over the phone, and would not allow you to pay in the store. I think that is very poor service. I took my business elsewhere.

My only mistake was I took it to go and by the time I got home the tariyaki glaze on my chicken made the bottom bun soggy.. Still tastes good! For my drink I tried their strawberry limeade with cucumber and it tastes very refreshing and sweet!   Have to say in my opinion it's All little pricey for a burger joint but the taste makes up for it! $14.59 for my chicken sandwich fries drink and a side order of onion rings! (I couldn't resist) My service was very friendly as well.   A must try!",

I've never been disappointed in my food choice. They offer a tea variety, some very sweet, some not. The tea and soda are serve yourself. I like that! Parking is limited but people are usually in and out rather quickly. The Habit offers outdoor dining. However, there is nothing quiet about the outdoor dining area as it is right on Glendale Ave.  It's a fast food set up. Counter order & pick up your food when your hand held buzzer buzzes. Very reasonably priced. All in all it's a big thumbs up. It's a happy chow down time.",

Less than $7 for lunch that's freshly made and delicious in this part of N. Central PHX is a win and you won't need to tip anyone or wait long to eat.  Is there a friendlier staff? Hard to find one. The dining room, the soda and drinks and the condiment area are always clean. Sometimes the tables could use more frequent cleanup and I've been here twice where someone has dropped a heinous deuce in the bathroom that the ventilation couldn't handle. It emanated into the dining room so I moved outside.   I think the burgers are some of the tastiest around and the fries are pretty damn good, too. I need to venture off of just burgers because the menu definitely offers more, but I love the char-burger so I can't quit it just yet.  Yeah, if management reads this...do something about the crapper, definitely. Bigger & badder exhaust fan or something.",

We ordered two veggie burgers with mushrooms since we are vegetarians.  We were given a beeper and waited just about 4 minutes until the beeper went off.  The veggie burgers are delicious.  There are real vegetables in the patty and they have great flavor.  It is served on a whole wheat toasted bun and has lettuce, tomato, onion, dijon mustard and sliced cucumber on it.  There are self serve cups for ketchup and various pickles and hot peppers.  We loved every bite!  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  I am thrilled that this is in our neighborhood as I plan to return again and again.   There are a lot of hamburger places all around but not that many offer a veggie burger.

I appreciate that for my vegetarian brother, they cook all their veggie patties on a separate flat grill with the buns. I feel like a lot of places don't pay attention to things like that.

I was a little surprised that I had to pay extra for cheese - especially when there were only 2 choices (American or Swiss).  I may have added on avocado, too, if it wasn't $1.00 (mainly because I can buy an entire avocado for that price across the street at Safeway...).  The burger was really good but the onion rings were EXCELLENT - and believe me - I know my onion rings! :)  They were thickly coated and perfectly cooked.  There were no puddles of grease left behind, either.  You know what was odd, though?  When I asked for ranch for my rings, they gave it to me - for free!  They'll give me a huge cup of ranch for free, but charge a whole dollar for avocado? Not sure how that makes sense, BUT - it was tasty, so whatever.  The chocolate shake was only okay - it tasted very strongly of Hershey's chocolate syrup...there's gotta be a better way to make a shake, no?  Overall I was pleased with my visit and will definitely go back when I need a burger and rings fix.",

The bun was nicely grilled and the onions were ok, but the tomatoes were under ripe, the pickles were cafeteria tasting, and I swear they got their burger meat from McDonalds. The fries were pretty good, though.  They renovated the place just before they moved in (the last place there had a bug infestation) and I think they didn't really think much about people attempting to move around inside.

    "text": "In the heart of midtown Phoenix, this tiny place serves up killer charred burgers. The restaurant is one of those (order and come pick up) kind of places, so no servers, your food is ready when the vibrating device lights up and vibrates. I walk in and was greeted by a lovely employee who was ready to take my order. I ordered the BBQ bacon char burger with portobello mushrooms and avocado, and sweet potato fries with a medium drink. They also had different type of goodies like tempura green beans so I got me one of those.   It took a little time, but for quality food I guess the wait is worth it.   The taste was good. I think I may have had too many elements in my burger that I didn't taste the flavors but there also was too much BBQ sauce. The geek beans were very tasty and my favorite was the sweet potato fries. Surprisingly they were very crunchy for a sweet potato fries (which is A+ for me)  I will definitely come back here, as the food was delicious, and the staff was very friendly.",

Being from Southern California, In n Out was always at the top of the fast food burger chain, but the habit sure does give it a run for its money. Every time I go to the habit I know I'm gonna get a consistent good tasting meal. Burgers are always nice and juicy and the caramelized onions are great. Their sides are also fantastic. Fried green beans and onion rings are delicious. Their ranch and thousand island dressing are on point too. I love how they have the hot chilis so you can use them on your burger if you like. Lastly, their specialty drink is freaking great. They know how to make a mean burger, and sides, and sauces, and drinks. They do the dang thing.",

    "text": "There are so many burger places littered throughout this city, all charging upwards of 10-15 dollars for a burger because the meat is grass fed, organic, or comes from some fantasy land that can only be accessible by white hipsters with beards. Then you have places like The Habit that do things the old school way. Or better yet, the easy way! The burgers taste great, the quality is consistent, and get this - the prices are actually cheap!  How is this possible, you might ask? Simply put, they don't feel the need to feed you the BS. Like In-N-Out, The Habit knows exactly what it's doing. There's no need to try to be all unique and \"ironic\" with your burger creations. Keep things simple, keep things cheap, and keep the quality high. It's an automatic recipe for success.  The Habit, despite being a fast food joint, offers burgers that are easily ranked right up there with some of the more upscale places you can find nearby. I usually opt for a single Charburger with fries, which is more than enough to fill up the average person. However, I intend to take things up a notch and try their Santa Barbara style burger during our next visit.  This is a place that offers a great no frills approach. No silly gimmicks, annoying trendy decor, or some desperate attempt to justify overpriced crap. It's simply just traditional burgers done extremely well. And judging by the business they get, I'm pretty sure that's what most people want.  On a side note, their chocolate malts are a great dessert, although I wouldn't recommend getting them until after your meal. They'll fill you up quite fast otherwise.  Does it exceed my love of In-N-Out? Not quite, but it's pretty damned close!",

The taller lady with black hair didn't seem enthusiastic or even happy to be taking our orders. When we get our food back there is more tomato than chicken on the sandwich, you see we have been to quite a few habit grills and the other places usually give us a decent piece of chicken on our chicken sandwich, but this experience is absolutely pitiful and the chicken was tough. Also, P.S. please don't give your coworkers a back rub when you are expected to be dealing with my food and the food of others.",

It's not legendary in the sense that Zinburger is and it lacks that level of awesomeness like Remington Grill in my home state of NC has, but it's pretty good. Imagine someone taking a frozen burger like you'd buy at Fry's, Sam's Club, or Costco, and they do a really awesome job grilling it. That's the best way I can describe the burgers here. They are really good - just in that \"best runner up\" category - rather than True champions.  As for the restaurant itself, it was pretty clean and had a decent selection of both indoor and outdoor seating.  My only real complaint is that the cashier who took our order had that \"hurry up and get it over with\" attitude. Other than that, I wouldn't mind coming back to this place.",

They don't list calories on any of their offerings as other burger places have started to do, so hard to tell how unhealthy it is. The Charburger is their standard burger and comes with caramelized onions, mayo and pickles. A lot of folks order the Double Char. They have a variety of salads, too, including a Cobb and grilled chicken. Prices are a tad higher than standard burger places but a little bit better too!  There is often a line at lunch and parking is sometimes hard to find at peak hours. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, so someone does a great job with hiring here.",

I asked for avocado on my chicken Cesar salad and she said it was extra I said ok, but I didn't get avocado on it. I also Asked for sweet potato fries for the kids meals and got regular fries on one and the other one the sweet potato fries tasted old and dry, no taste. Again I've never had issues with this place even when they're busy and today I had so many issues and it wasn't as busy. Very disappointed, won't be coming here again.

    "text": "I had high hopes for the Habit since I live only a couple miles away, but it was mostly disappointing for me.  I'm vegetarian, so I have no idea how their meat burgers taste, and they may be the best in the world for all I know, but the veggie burger was a tasteless lump for the most part.  I do give them kudos for having a veggie burger, but either put more effort into it, or take it off the menu and go full-on meat!  The service was nice, and I like the design of the place, but there are too many good veggie burgers to be had in the Valley to waste my time eating this one.  Parking lot is super-cramped, so if you need your meatburger fix, then don't come right at 12 or 6, unless you want to park in someone's yard.",

The sweet potato fries were also good, but again, nothing that you can't get at other burger joints. The restaurant was very clean and the staff were courteous and friendly.

Clean bright and staff was friendly.  Ordered the Santa Fe, fries and onion rings.   Told them it was to go and I was given a restaurant tablet that signals when ur food is ready (I don't know what to call that thing that vibrates and lights up when ur table is ready).  The best thing that I ordered was the onion rings.  The French fries had that dried out cheap diner feel.  The sandwich left alot to be desired.  The beef was low quality and the bread was toasted/fried with butter and oil.  The overall thing was a wet soggy mess.  I didn't eat the entire thing and ended up throwing it away.  I was hoping for a nice grilled quality beef hamburger and instead had a small step above a $1 McDonald's patty.  Either way in a pinch I would be back....I just know now what to expect however Will keep looking for my go-to burger place.",

I have been here way too many times the past month and have made it a habit.  I get a double char with cheese.  The onions don't leave the nasty after taste in your mouth.  I get onion rings instead of the fries as the fries are not spectacular.  Their onion rings are great though.  They also have a strawberry, lime, cucumber drink that is good.  Usually I don't order a drink from places because I am not big on soda or teas but this is a nice change.  Their milkshakes are nothing special.  Their chocolate sundae is good though and comes with whip cream and nuts.  I would give them a 5 if they had better desert options.  We have been stuck on coming here for the past month.  I am not a big fan of Smashburger, In & Out or Culvers (except their ice cream which is my favorite) and don't understand what the hype is about their burgers but the Habit's burgers are worth eating.  And to top it off - every time we have been there the staff has been great!  Bad thing I found out today though - they don't open until 10:30 am and sometimes we like to eat lunch earlier.  Total for two double char's with cheese, onion rings instead of fires and two drinks comes to $19.00 and some change.  If I get a sundae with it then it is $22.00 and some change - not bad for a meal that is good and I don't have to throw out.",

I am not a fan of open condiment stations.  The team members were cheerful.  Lots of smiling going on.  This could be because they just opened.  They are getting a lot of traffic from up the hill judging by the peeps I saw today.  Paradise Valley - Tons of Brophy kids - Veritas.   I ordered a single burger, sweet potato fries and a soda.  The burger was really good.  It was grilled very nicely and was fresh and juicy but not runny.  I loved the caramelized onions - shredded lettuce - mayo - fresh dill pickle chip - I think that was it - very good.  The bun was even good.  The sweet potato fries - not so much.  They were okay.  Delux and Maizie's still are the best for sweet potato fries.  The have Coke products.  I am a Pepsi girl, but I can sacrifice when necessary.  The prices were very good.  Not at all expensive - in fact, I think they are cheaper than In n Out.  The two of us ate a la carte (we didn't get the uh bundles? or whatever they are called) - for around 18 bucks.  We were both generally pleased.  We will be back - maybe take out next time? I was using a walker and tangled with the carpets a couple of times, but then, that is what happens when you have open condiment stations and self-serve soda.  Urghhh.  If you are on crutches or a walker, use the front entrance and have someone do your drinks and condiments.",

If you're going for a meaty burger, there are loads of options, and still a couple options for us veggie-only eaters, too. You can request grilled onions or raw, but don't choose grilled if you're a vegetarian, as they are cooked on the meat grilling surface.   They'll serve your sandwich/burger on any bread you choose, so be creative. Also a nice touch is the peppers bar to add to your burger. Fries and rings are a la carte, but worth the buy. Those onion rings are delish.   It's a solid crowd pleaser and the fancy cucumber lemonades and such that they have as refillable fountain drinks are great, too.",

Looking around the dining area it reminded me of a modern burger joint with favorable seating outside. Somebody ordered a salad that looked delish...Hmmm, maybe I'll get one too next time?    The wait time was only about 10 minutes. The food portions looked small on the tray but it was big enough to hit the spot! The burger was juicy and the onion rings crisp and crunchy with flavor (salty-ish?). Not sure, but I really dug them both. I had a medium drink I crazy mixed of peach ginger and strawberry lemonade. The ranch dressing for the 'rings rounded out a great meal, and if I'm in the neighborhood again, I just might try out that salad I was peepin' at!

Pathetic and sad performance by one of our former favorites - plenty of other and better choices all around. Would advise everyone else to do the same.",

Decided to splurge and ordered a Char Broiled Cheese Burger and Boy am I glad I did! Yum ME!!  Thick, char grilled patty loaded with grilled onions and the usual toppings. The kids size burger seemed to be the same size as the regular burger which my older boys gobbled down in mere seconds.   The milk shake machine was broken which was a bummer but all in all a great lunch! Fast and friendly service to boot.",

We both got burgers and they were not memorable. Fries were okay. The only good part of our meal were the milkshakes that were pretty tasty.   Overall, highly disappointing.

    "text": "Normally their burgers are awesome. I have had their chicken sandwich, tuna, and regular burger and have never been disappointed, until now. I ordered a burger and onion rings to go via Internet. When I got there my order didn't appear to be ready. After a short 5 minute wait my order came up. Cool, back to work I go. When I got back to work and sat down to eat, it looked like my burger had been stepped on, smashed up with a dry bun. As stated before , their burgers never disappoint. This one had a flavor like it had been sitting for a while. Onion rings were hot because they cook them when you arrive. Everything else was spot on including the service.  I think next time I'll just walk in and order to go so my food will be fresh as possible. The stale burger most likely a product of bad timing. I recommend eating there, just be careful ordering.  Update: I just took the wife there for supper. I had my usual double with cheese, onion rings, and a very nice flavored tea. Mrs. had her usual single with cheese, fries, and soda. The food came out hot and delicious as usual. I especially like the unsweetened flavored teas they serve. Very nice change of pace from the usual sodas.",

Rare as requested; * great flavor. Flavor is the key.   Maggie helped at the counter, a consummate pro?  No. Just well-trained, friendly, smiling, helpful, everything an employer would want.   And she remembered to ask me for preferred cooking temperature. I forgot and since I like it \"rare\", it's important. You know, she could've just had it cooked \"medium\", neglected my True temperature choice and let it go. But she checked, I'm happy!  The Habit advertises, \"sushi-quality\", but this expression has no real world food meaning.   It's like when they say \"voted best buffet\". Who said? Who voted?    I guess what it really means, what it's supposed to mean is it \"really good tuna\". AND IT WAS!!!  REALLY GOOD TUNA. See photos!  I don't like The Habit 'beeper alert system' they employ, but this was mid-afternoon and it was PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!!  I watched it being made.  Sometimes your food sits there; sometimes it sits there BEFORE the beeper fires up. Quote me: The First 2-3 minutes when a burger is done is critical!  You're gonna pay $15 at Bluewater Grill for a sandwich not this good. I paid $7.15.",

Oh wait i'll tell you, they have front parking for pickup orders and you can call your order in ahead of time so it's hot and ready to go when you get there. The prices are under 20 bucks for two combos and that's a steal Defiantly making the habit my go to burger stop from now on.",

Changes were noticed and I have been a regular customer since, although a visit on Saturday (Apr. 28th) will change that again.  As I was eating I witnessed an employee wiping tables with a rag.  Someone behind the counter yelled at him to clean up a mess on the floor so he bent down and wiped up the floor with the same rag.  Then he proceeded to wipe off all the used trays with that same rag and put them back into circulation to be used by the next customers.  I got up to leave and said something to the girl behind the counter about it and she just ignored me.   So I will be ignoring this restaurant from now on.",

    "text": "So, I was a little hesitant to try this place.  One, because of the name and two because I just thought it was meat burgers.  That all changed when one of my coworkers told me they had a ridiculous veggie burger.    The veggie burger comes with honey mustard, cucumbers, sprouts, lettuce, onion and tomato.  I added pickles to mine, cause I love them.  They have a lovely little condiment bar, packed full with items like: jalapenos, pepperoncinis, ketchup, malt  vinegar, A1 sauce and more!  I may or may have used any and all of those items:) The little woman indulged in one of their chocolate milkshakes, which was ok, but I prefer shakes made with chocolate ice cream and not syrup.  The food is pretty cheap and the register gals are very bubbly.    The only downside is that the closer you get to the bathroom, the more it smells like stinkin' sewage. Bleh.   Oh, right! They also have beef burgers (duh) and grilled chicken sandwiches and things of that nature for you meat lovin' folks.",

So, when I go and special order like no mayo or such - anything to keep liquid off it! - it becomes kind of a major ordeal there.  Almost not worth it and just suffer through a soggy sandwich.

    "text": "So I know 5 stars may seem a little crazy, but the burger was absolutely delicious!!!  My friend and I hit up The Habit tonight a little after 5pm. There was plenty of parking (found a shady spot which was awesome since it was pretty hot), open booths (that were clean), and I didn't have to wait in line (which I absolutely do NOT have patience for...especially when I'm hungry).   I looked over the menu for a minute and decided on the Double Char combo...when in Rome right? SO happy I went with the Double because the burger was absolutely delicious!!!  THE FOOD: The burger was hot, juicy, cheesy, cooked to perfection (well done which I emphasized), had a great charbroiled taste, and was topped with fresh veggies and encased in a perfectly toasted sesame seed bun!!   I went with plain ole' french fries. They were crispy, not overly salted, but just ok. Nothing to write home about.   My friend got the sweet potato fries, so I was able to steal a few and try them out. They were pretty darn tasty, but I'm not a huge fan of sweet potato fries, nor a connoisseur, so not sure how good they really are compared to others.   We didn't get a shake or ice cream, but after just the burger and half of my fries, I was stuffed!   I think next time I'll go with just the burger and get a shake!! Or share an order of fries. They weren't huge like 5 Guys, but they were still a pretty big order, and pretty big french fries.   THE INSIDE: The restaurant was clean, had plenty of seating, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and I didn't have to wait long to park, order, or pick up my food.   I like that they didn't have music blaring on the inside like another burger joint I know *cough*5Guys*cough*. My friend and I were actually able to sit and chit chat without screaming across the table to each other. The inside was pretty modern, clean, industrial looking which was nice. The Habit has a great feel to it overall.   If there's one complaint I have, it's that the outside seating area faces Glendale, which is fairly busy any time of day, so it gets really noisy.   THE PRICE: The price point is fairly reasonable. My total came to around $8 and change for the #2 Double Char Combo with french fries and a drink. Not too shabby. But the a la carte burger prices were pretty decent too.   THE VERDICT: Habit cherry popped? Check! And all in all, it was a great first visit!! I'm definitely a new fan, and have already raved (and dreamed, and salivated) about my dericious burger, and keep thinking about the next time I'll have one. Seriously can't wait to go back for more!!!",

Between Five Guys, Smashburger and The Habit, my vote and my money would definitely go to The Habit.  First of all, their prices are so much more reasonable than any of the either places, you can get a burger and fries or onion rings for around $7, while just a burger can be that much or more at Five Guys.  The interior is bright and clean, and the service was fast.  My cheeseburger was juicy and the toppings were fresh, and I am a big fan of their onion rings!  I also like the fact that they have other things on the menu, the shrimp burger looks intriguing!  For a quick lunch that is easy on the wallet, The Habit is a good choice.",

The fries are also spectacular.  I brought my six year old here last week and we tried the Caesar salad which was surprisingly good.   I am truly amazed that they can have a typical hamburger, fries and fast food menu alongside chicken, tri-steak, salads and other options.  The selection is first rate and the prices are reasonable.  The wait staff are friendly and courteous and truly want to assure their customers are satisfied.  The reason I did not provide a five star rating is due to the size of the restaurant.  The inside is small and it can be a maze to make it to the fixin bar to get a refill.  The restaurant is normally at least three quarters filled and should be probably be expanded in some way.  The parking can be a challenge.    Give it a try, you will not be disappointed.",

You'll order one fucking burger and get a huge ass plastic container with a lid and a piece of lettuce with a fucking orange slice on the side, taking up half of the container. WHAT IS THAT FOR. Get some more size appropriate containers and package things more efficiently. 7) The uniforms are outdated and dull, I feel like I'm looking at a hospital wall when I see The Habit polos. 8) The food is trash. The buns suck. In summary, The Habit is unsatisfying, illogical, wasteful, crappy, outdated, and inefficient.",

I am from New Mexico and am always looking for restaurants that cook with great New Mexico Green and Red Chile.  Today was my first experience this new offering from Habit and it was fantastic!  Since I am sort of a purist when it comes to green chile,not chili, burgers, I would suggest you try it without the chipotle salsa, swiss cheese and mayonnaise and opt for American Cheese and raw onions with mustard.  MmmmmmMmmmmmmMmmmmmm!",

    "text": "This place isn't half bad.  What they lack in some areas they make up for in others, and overall, not a half bad place.  The Habit is more of a fast casual dining experience, where you order at the counter and they have you pick up your food when it's ready.  The place is well decorated, colorful and had a decent menu selection to choose from.  Prices are fair, but I did have a few issues with how they rang up my order.  For starters, you can get a basic burger combo for $5.95.  This includes fries and a drink.  Awesome!  Plus, you can refill your drink a lot, which is a bonus since I go through a bit of pop when I eat out.  The down side?  If you want anything else but the regular fries, its going to cost you, and that upset me.  I didn't want the regular fries and I wanted sweet potato fries instead as a treat.  The down side?  They charged me a la carte for my order instead of the value meal price, so my order was twice as much as I was hoping it would be.  I think the sweet potato fries ended up being $2.95, or something ridiculous like that.  I mean, I understand an extra 50 cents, but really?  a la carte? UGH.  I mean, the foods good, but not THAT good.  Service here was nice and friendly.  The manager walked around to make sure we were happy with our order, and the food was filling and tasty.  I like it as an alternative to fast food, and it was a great quick meal.  Next time I'm here, I think I will stick with the regular fries since I didn't like the extra charge.  Not a half bad place.  It's worth giving a shot.",

I've tried the burgers, fries, tuna sandwich, and chicken sandwich, and have always been satisfied with my order.  Their teriyaki sauce is actually decent.  Only once have I managed to get them to input in the register and correctly leave off the orange garnish that comes with the tuna sandwich.  I can't do citrus, so that takes off a second star.  The Habbit is a nice \"fast casual\" middle ground between a gourmet burger and Sonic or Wendy's.  I actually prefer them to In-n-Out (better fries), though lack of a drive through makes them less convenient.",

There are many delicious burger options in Phoenix and The Habit Burger Grill is worth mentioning on that list.  The burgers are tender and juicy, very delicious and cooked just right.  Delicious salty fries.  Service is fast and perfect for to go orders.  Upon my return to the Phoenix metro area, I will consider The Habit more often when I crave a burger...and that is pretty often.",

Pei Wei, Sauce and Qdoba on the North side of the street have now been joined by The Habit on the South side at a site that once held a sub sandwich shop and later, a local coffee house.  I ordered the double char burger and while it was not up the quality of burger found at Delux or RnR, it was better than most chains and just as good as anything found at Five Guys or Fuddruckers.   So, if you're looking for a quick place to get a burger and you want something better than McDonalds or Burger King, you could certainly do worse than taking up this Habit!",

    "text": "Visited the place after church yesterday evening (9/11/11).  Not really sure if they were officially open yet since they had a pre-opening  charity lunch early in the day.  First impression:  they completely transformed the old space (Unlimited Coffee) into a fresh, bright & modern food joint.  Although I found it small, I'll give them a pass since they only have that much real estate to work on the former cafe.  The only other thing I also noticed, there were a lot of employees.  Most of them cramped inside the counter area.   Must be THE training day!  On to the food:  we ordered a mushroom burger, a Charburger and a double Charburger, side ceasar salad, sweet potato fries and drinks - rang at about $20 with tax.  We were impressed with the taste knowing that we just saw them grill those patties on a barbeque grill (not a flat grill). Some people may or may not like that way but we personally like how they grill it similar to how Original Hamburger Works does it.  We sat at the outside patio area which should be good during the times when the weather is much nicer.  Yesterday though, it was a bad decision since we saw the haboob fast approaching from the east (can't see Squaw Peak from where we are seated).  Made us chew our burgers faster :)  I think this joint is a welcome addition to the CenPho neighborhood.  More burger competition can only mean better things for us diners.  We will definitely come back again.  Next time will probably try the entree salads or the tuna sandwich.",

I found this place on Yelp with the delivery/pick up filter.  I used their website to place and pay for a pickup order.  Website was easy to use, and as soon as I finished the order we left for the 15 minute drive to retrieve the food.  Food was ready when we arrived and pick up was easy.  Food was fresh.  Picky kids all ate dinner without complaint.  The real challenge was my husband.  He enjoyed the burger and the side Caesar salad.  Very good was his rating, which is akin to a rave review.  I marked down one star as my salad had no dressing.  The salad, the Cobb, was tasty without the dressing, but I still would have preferred the option of having some type of dressing for my salad.",

Plenty of wrap to hold the burger, and not have to use a fork/knife, but you can still enjoy all the flavor of burger!! Very fine line! Perfect burger for my low carb habits! My kiddo had fries, and they weren't super hot, not totally impressive, but I also wouldn't call them bad. Hubs had the double char lettuce wrapped, which was just as delicious. Very yummy tropical tea as well! The best thing about this location though, the service was excellent. Several attentive workers grabbing trash and asking if we needed anything! Although busy, everyone had smiles and it felt like we were the only people in the restaurant. I will definitely go again!",

It was better tasting and slightly cheaper than the nearby Shake Shack.   However the music selection was downright odd, and awful. It seemed like it was selected by someone with multiple personality disorder (no offense to those who actually suffer from it). It went from typical whining country music, to Destiny's Child, to Avril Lavigne, and other I don't know what. To add insult to injury it seemed to be the worst selection from every genre. I mean it was bad. It left me confused . And this is from someone who usually could care less about the music in a restaurant.",
