    "text": "I used to go here a lot as a kid. It was kind of a tradition for my family to go there after Phoenix Giants/Firebirds games. Or was it before the games? I don't know. Anyway, as a kid, it was my favorite pizza. Then we lost the Firebirds, and a few years later I moved to Los Angeles for school, and I went several years without going here. In the last two years, I've finally made it back to Red Devil on a couple occasions.  The restaurant is just as it was when I was a kid, right down to the old-school arcade game in the corner. And the pizza tastes the same too. And while it's still very good, I've got a couple favorite pizza joints in L.A. that edge it out. Still, when I'm in Phoenix and I'm hankering pizza, I don't know of a better place to go to satisfy the craving.",

The server was very courteous and attentive.",

I always get the same thing but occasionally when I bring friends, they order different things and I try them. Always delicious. The cheese sticks are perfect, the garden salad (you can get get small or large, small is big enough for 2-3 people) is pretty plain but the house made italian and bleu cheese is great and then there's the pizza. I've tried a hell of a lot of pizza and this is definitely up there in the top 5. Seriously, no bullshit, just great pizza with delicious sauce and it heats up perfectly fine, too. I've had just about every server in there and service is always fantastic. Try this place, you won't be sorry.",

We ordered three entrees and four desserts (It was so early that I was still full from lunch!) Anyway, they bring out our desserts first! We kinda all look at each other and the waitress takes a cue and says, oh the food isn't ready yet so I thought I would start you off with some desserts. Okay, cool, we will take it. We ate our desserts and were still waiting for our food! It was nuts. We went in for a quick bite and it took 2 hours! Haha and flagging someone to get us our check was darn near impossible. Oh and it is in a sketch part of Phx. haha!  The food: Their Tortellini Alfredo was good! I think that was my fave of the entrees brought to us. None of us tried their calzones or pizza, but we were close!  Their desserts: They only advertise one...their trifle. It is good, but not damn near as incredible as their version of the pizookie! I had a friend who wanted to make a baby with the cheesecake and their brownie with ice cream was respectable. Save room for dessert here...and just get the pizookie! Yum!",

The pizza is always piping hot, cheese that is like liquid, crispy crust, fresh toppings that seem to be made just for you.   Always ask about the special. We get the pizza and wings special when available.  The wings are always crisp like a they were flash fried.  The sauce base is a BBQ sauce instead of butter like many chains.    The service is always attentive, seldom do I have to ask for a refill or other item.  This makes Red Devil a must for our birthdays, date night with other couples or just some comfort food.

There is an outdoor window for takeout orders an you can watch as the pizzas are made.   The wait wasn't as long as thought it was going to be; the person who cashed me out told me it would be over 30mis AFTER my card was charged. Luckily it only took 15-20 mins MAX and we were on our way.   The good part is that the pizza is very fresh as its VERY busy. I liked the taste of the outermost crust and the toppings were generous.  The sauce was a little sweet for my taste; I prefer a more savory sauce paired with most dishes.  The bottom part of the crust was much more soggy and didn't hold up to the toppings, this was not good as it took away from the pizza in that I almost wish the whole crust could have been like the outside. It makes me think that maybe it was streched to much or not cooked enough.   I don't know that I would try this restuarant for dinner, especially if the sauce for entrees is just as sweet. It was just ok to me and not a place I would go out of my way to head to.",

Even with the volume of take out traffic- they were spot on. An order picked up ahead of me had 10 large pizzas- and my pizza was ready to go too. So needless to say- they have their timing and system down pat.  It's a little place. I remember coming here a few times as a child in the 70's and dining in. I thought it was long past time to stop by again. So- what's better on a Friday night but some classic pizza and watching the opening ceremony of the Olympics? They did not disappoint!  I ordered the large pizza with pepperoni. I figured, keep it simple and classic and I wouldn't be disappointed. It was EXACTLY as the pizza I remembered as a child. There were plenty of pepperonis that were full of flavor. Thin crust, simple sauce and fresh mozzarella cheese. Yes, there were pools of grease- but hey- it's real cheese and real pepperonis- that is what it is suppose to be. None of that designer stuff like arugula and grilled chicken, Don't get me wrong- designer pizzas are good, but this is True old fashioned pizza.  Parking is limited and there is usually a line at the take out window, but it moves quickly. While you are at the window, you can see the process. It is a narrow kitchen, but the staff communicate well and everyone moves in synch.   I will be back, and I hope to make it for a dine in experience some time soon.",

I've had several of their dishes which are also delicious, but I would be doing a disservice to pizza lovers if I didn't recommend this place!   PS, when you ask for extra cheese, they aren't messing around either!  LOVE IT!!!",

The best part was the desert.  I ordered the desert that has the pudding.  It was good.  My mom used to make a similar desert when I was a kid.  My mom would add oreos to it also.

We took it as a good sign that the parking lot in front of the restaurant was completely packed & the extra parking lot off to the side of the restaurant only had a couple of empty spaces. When we walked in, we were promptly seated & the first thing we noticed was that this is very much a family-style restaurant.  After taking a look through their menu, we decided to get the fried zucchini & mushroom combo for appetizers and the barbeque chicken pizza for our meal. While we waited for our meal, we were served two rolls with butter which were good. The appetizer was also good - crunchy breading & not greasy. The barbeque pizza, as the previous items was good too - lots of barbeque sauce, chicken, & onions. Some bites tasted a little burnt so it was nothing to rave about. We ordered the 10\" size which had 6 pieces ... I'd say this was the right for two if you're hungry & also get appetizer to share. Lastly, we finished off with snickers cheesecake. I personally wasn't a fan of it, especially compared to other cheesecakes I've had in the past.  Overall, the impression was that everything was just good ... Nothing great that you'd rave about to friends & family but nothing bad either; we're undecided whether or not we'd go back.",

My husband and I both ordered pasta dishes.  The pasta itself was ok, but I am a big stickler for a good sauce, and this didn't fit the bill.  I expect my marinara sauce to have some tang, and not taste like jarred tomatoes with no spice.  It almost seemed as if the joint had toned down the sause to ensure it would be more palatable to the masses.  There are much more delicious places in town, but the service was good, and you could bring your entire family here and squeeze them all in.  If you're simply going with your spouse or a friend or two, I'd give it a pass.",

I love their blue cheese dressing, I get on a garden salad, which is just iceberg lettuce and few different veggies( probably bagged salad) this dressing makes it delicious.

Definitely different and definitly tasty.  However, I had a HORRIBLE experience with the eggplant parmesan here.  It was just glops of cheese and really bitter eggplant.  One of the worst dishes I have ever eaten at any restaurant.  I'm not one to complain about my meals, though, so I picked through it and left the majority.  On a really positive note, the waiter asked me if there was something wrong with my food.  I replied, \"Oh, no, I'm just not that hungry.\"  He insisted on asking if I wanted something else, and he took some of the charge off our bill when it arrived.  So that was pretty cool.  Word to the wise... stick with the apps and pizza here.  Eggplant parmesan, not so much.",

For our entrees, I ordered the baked lasagna and my boyfriend ordered the double bacon cheeseburger.  I only took about two bites of my lasagna which was so overloaded with flavorless marinara that I could not bare another, and my boyfriend only ate about half of his double cheeseburger that looked comparable to a McDonald's burger and tasted like a \"slightly better quality school lunch burger\".

Both flavors had great taste. For an appetizer, the restaurant always provides fresh dinner rolls. They definitely were slightly different than I remember. My sister and I always opt for the small garden salads as well. The ranch Red Devil offers, is hands down the best ranch ever. The taste is something you just cannot get anywhere else.

I've only had it once before coming for dine in and it was in the top five in town.  The house margarita however - has hot sauce in it - which is fine, but one should be reminded of that before preparing ones mouth for standard 'rita flavor.   The main course, was about as basic as it gets. The pasta was still watery and the sauces were bland.  Service was solid - but if I ever eat here again it will be pick up or delivery pizza.",

I'm really pretty easy to please.   Give me a place that has good wings and cold beer and I'm happy.  Well, I know, I know, most people probably don't go to Red Devil for wings, but my eyes went to them on my first visit and again on my second.   And those eyes were much larger than my stomach on my 2nd visit, so it was wings for dinner the next night too.   Anyway, the \"hot\" wings and the bbq wings are my fav.  With a side of \"hot\" sauce and ranch.  The hot is not really hot, but it tastes good.  And they're priced right and the wings are really pretty hearty.   They're good wings.   I really need to order something else on the menu next time!   And the beer is cold ;)  But don't order sparkling wine.  J. Roget is your only option.  Trust me ladies, don't order it.     I like Red Devil.",

Red Devil has been a favorite in our family since I was a small child! In fact, for a while it was our Friday tradition!   My favorite {& I literally get it every time --SUPER unhealthy, but worth the cheat day!} is the Chicken Romano. It is DEFINITELY enough for two. It is two pounded out, super thin chicken cutlets, deep fried and floating in garlic butter, lemon, green onions and Romano cheese. Can you say YUM?! I always get it with a side of their spaghetti marinara (You get to choose a side of your choice). It also comes with a salad -- their ranch is AMAZING. I know, this meal is worth a whole week of calories but it is seriously delightful.  I promise you won't be disappointed at Red Devil!",

What stood out most however was the service. I am not sure that this was his name but I believe our server was Jesus. Even though this isn't a fine dining restaurant so over the top service isn't expected I was pleasantly surprised how attentive our server was. Aside from being attentive his attitude was great the whole time. I hate nothing more than going out to eat and having a server who clearly doesn't want to be there and Jesus was the opposite of this. Seemed happy to be there and intent on making everyone's dinner enjoyable. Thanks! Will definitely be back",

    "text": "I love this place...best pizza in Phoenix- hands down! Wings are amazing, service is always phenomenal. I simply love this restaurant. I have to admit that I may be a bit biased as this place holds a lot of sentimental value to me. My family and I have eaten here for years and years. At this point- 4 generations worth, that I know for sure, have dined at and loved Red Devil. My husbands favorite is the sausage and artichoke pizza- while mine is the Red Devil combo. We always split an order of medium wings and get bigger then we know we will eat- pizza so we can have some to bring home.   This restaurant also does well balancing the \"family friendly\" with the \"date night\" crowds. I will say that we live much closer to the Mesa (Tempe?) location and have gone there 4-5 times...completely not the same. Yes, same-ish food, but the other location just simply does not have it like the McDowell one. Dont waste your time at the other one- just go to the McDowell location and enjoy!",

They weren't considerate and told us we needed to wait another hour until the other party was done. They didn't accommodate us at all when we then decided to order take out they said we would need to wait another 30 minutes. We left and they lost out on money and 25 customers.

    "text": "This is the original, long standing Red Devil restaurant that has been in this location for many decades. When you walk in, you'll notice even the decor hasn't changed. This is affordable, Italian comfort food at its best. They also happen to make the best hot wings! (The pizza is not bad, either).  For some reason, their 'medium' hot wing sauce is a mixture of hot sauce and BBQ sauce. I think its disgusting. But the mild and hot are normal. However, for me the mild is just too mild and the hot is just too hot. Well, they also offer a 'New York Mild' which isn't quite medium, but is very flavorful with a hint of hot.  I recommend ordering the wings crispy, New York mild. Soooooo good!  I wish they would serve celery with the wings and I wish they served Coke instead of Pepsi. Those are my only complaints...  The staff is always friendly, there is never a long wait to receive your food after ordering and its not too difficult to get a table on a typical busy Phoenix Friday or Saturday night. And did I mention how affordable it is?   10 wings = $7.99 1 soda = $2.49 1 Small Garden Salad: $3.59  Of course they have manicotti, ravioli, speghetti, etc... Lot's of Italian comfort food to choose from on the menu. This is my favorite place for wings!",

Now I'm out $25 because apparently no one answers the phone. The only option is to re route the driver 50 minutes away and I get a nasty cold pizza.

Since there are very few landmarks in Phoenix, or anywhere in the Valley for that matter any more.  It is nice to come in here. I love the look of it. It is not fancy, but very cool indeed! We had to run some errands in Downtown Phx right at rush hour last night. So rather that be on the road for 2 hours trying to get home,we thought we would just go to Dinner. Since we had not been to Red Devil in so long,it was a great choice.  I love the ambiance here. Good music playing. A couple of different things on the telly.  We had a great server, Megan. She was everything perfect for our server. She knew the menu and how things were made. She was attentive and took away the plates and trash items promptly.We really enjoyed our experience. While I have always loved the food here,it has not changed. We got pizza and 2 types of wings. I do not know what they do to the Pizza Crust,how they make it.  But, it is thin, crisp, and delicious. It is perfect. They use real mushrooms ,not canned, and the cheese and sauce are wonderful! The Wings also, Fantastic. They are big, both the drumsticks and the wings. But, not full of fat like some places. These are all meat and no fat. The sauce they put on them are homemade right there in house.We got New York style Medium and the Hot wings.  They also have Rolls with butter. I am not a fan of Bread, however the rolls here are amazing! They have a secret for making great food. I do not what it is but, I hope they never change.  They even have Happy Hour drink prices in the Dining room. Once again they made us so happy. What a wonderful place to spend rush hour. There is a Red Devil in Tempe as well. The customer service there is not even close to this location.  I just love everything about this place. Even the smell here is great. Like a real Italian Kitchen.",

I know the people from Phoenix truly enjoy this place if they were able to expand only would not for sure if there's any other locations in the valley but it would be awesome to get 1D peas and deep last so everyone can experience Red Devil Italian restaurant tremendous flavor and quality in ingredients that they serve you you can't miss out on this excellent restaurant that's been around the valley for over 50 years I can menu in the staff in the Cubs for continuing to bring the quality that is necessary to continue to keep up the good work you will see me again.",

The only way to get the coupons is to sign up through email, and then the Coupons are emailed to you. But, I never got the coupons through my email. Fortunately, the waitress understood the situation, called over the manager right away, and the manager honored the coupon even though I didn't actually have it in my possession.

Good energetic people make all the difference and Red Devil has plenty.",

    "text": "So, for more than a year, I drove by this place on my way to work but never checked it out. I wasn't sure what to make of a place with a walk-up takeout window. Last night, I followed a group of friends there for a late dinner. Didn't try any appetizers. I just split a 14' Italian special pizza--sausage, green olives and fresh garlic. The pizza was pretty good, not spectacular but definitely a couple steps above a place like Mamma Mia's whose pizza has a fast-food quality at times. Red Devil is very generous when it comes to toppings, at least on this one. I am an olive lover but haven't had green olives on pizza before. I enjoyed olives in every bite. But if you think olives are just okay, you might have found it a bit much. The pizza was kind of big for two people and with tax, it was about $18. So, I'd say it's fairly priced.   I have to say that the service, more than the pizza, would draw me back. Servers who think of the little things before you even ask are much appreciated. We had a party of nine and our waiter was super patient. We also brought a birthday cake on the premises, which they allow. Our waiter started clearing all our plates and silverware and before I could ask, he said not to worry, he'd bring us clean plates and forks for the cake. He also saw someone with a camera and asked to take a picture. He just gave off a genuine vibe of being helpful. I would definitely consider it if in the mood for something casual but not carbon-copy fast food.",

    "text": "Red Devil catered a Junior Classical League (for students of Latin and Greek) lunch for our annual convention last month. Getting the food was one of my responsibilities and I had considered deli trays and had also looked at a few other catering places on line. All I knew is that I'd sooner die than call Fazoli's (who has often catered this lunch before). So it struck me suddenly with about a week to go- Red Devil! It's Italian, so it fits the theme, and we have always had a good meal there when we've gone.   I stopped in to see the GM, Doug, and he took my order, assuring me that the portions listed for the hotel pan sizes I was getting are generous- I was feeding teenagers, after all, so I had my concerns. I was relieved that they could easily and pleasantly take my order so late in the game. They dropped off the food at our location on time, hot and fresh, and they even brought the napkins, plates, and plastic-ware.   The food was a HUGE hit with everyone. The first pan to be emptied was the meat lasagna, followed by the chicken lasagna, and then the veggie penne pastas, one with chicken. The rolls were fantastic, and they even gave us plenty of real butter. Even the salads were by far a bigger hit with the kids than I had expected. And Doug was right- there was plenty of food and lots of people went back for seconds.  Best of all, when I gave the receipt to the treasurer of the organization, she was shocked at how low the price was, since last year, Fazoli's had cost close to twice as much! There is absolutely no comparison between the two when it comes to quality.  I would heartily recommend Red Devil for your catering needs- as well as for dinner. My colleagues and I have since fielded many requests from attendees and their parents for the name of the restaurant and we will continue to use them from now on whenever our convention is in the Phoenix area. Gratias vobis ago, Doug and Red Devil!",

Thankfully I was the one to go and pick it up, otherwise I would not have seen the APPALLING kitchen conditions. Takeout orders are picked up from a window directly into the kitchen. Now, this may not be an issue for someone who doesn't have food allergies, but I was able to see that literally every surface in that kitchen was covered with a layer of flour - wheat flour.  This included: the cook's hands and arms up to the elbow, the cash register, the money he gave me as change, the entire food prep area, as well as the take-out boxes and bags that the food was in (the bag even left flour smudges on my car mats!).  As I said though, that may be completely irrelevant to anyone who doesn't have allergies.  But to me, it was the equivalent of seeing a dozen cockroaches scurry across the kitchen floor.  When I placed our order, I specifically told the guy on the phone that I had a gluten allergy, and can you please check to make sure there is no gluten in your salad dressing, and no croutons on my salad.  He said it was fine.  Of course when I opened the box it did have croutons, and the box itself had flour fingerprints on it.  No way I was touching that food!  The rest of the office said that their meals were ok, but nothing noteworthy.  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere with better kitchen hygiene practices (because you never know what ELSE they don't clean up!).",

Four of us came here last week for a birthday dinner, and I honestly just wasn't impressed. We ordered the Italian Special and the Greekfest, and both were overloaded with toppings and falling apart, and overall not too flavorful. Olives were everywhere, and if you are only a partial olive fan, it isn't too great.   Plus side- the service was very good and I had a cup of the soup that was decent.  overall probably wouldn't come back.",

Not that it is a bad thing to remain the same.   We after going to see the Chihuly exhibit we decided to stop here for dinner.   The two women who greeted and served us were fine I guess. Timing when you put the order in to come out when salads are eaten would be nice, but what the hell.   Antipasto Salad .........................................................Small $7.95 Large $10.95  Artichoke hearts, fresh Roma tomatoes, pepperoncinis, black and green olives, provolone cheese, Genoa salami, red and green bell peppers, radishes and cappicola.   We ordered the large for four people. This salad was a joke, three small artichokes were found, less than one full sheet of cheap cheese and salami were used and no Roma tomatoes. perhaps a half of a radish was sliced in to it and a bunch of lettuce all for $10.95   Gus and I shared a medium: Red Devil Combo $17.70  Pepperoni, chunky sausage, onions, mushrooms & green peppers   The taste was OK I guess even though the onion was the part I would throw away. But the crust was like shoe leather. I have all my teeth and could not bite through it and the knife too had one hell of a time cutting it .   Our Friends ordered something else; what I do not know.   The prices here are much too high for the quality,",

I have been going there for years and one of the reason why I like it so much is because it is a place you where don't have to worry about bringing little kids.  The traditional \"Mom and Pop Atmosphere\" makes this place a great escape from the franchised world.   The wings are great. I just have one caveat: If you have never been there before: Medium Wings translate into Mild Wings, and Mild Wings translate into Barbecue Wings. Personally I prefer the Medium or Hot Wings.  Nevertheless the wings are great and the pie is no-nonsense style Italiano.   The Red Devil is overall a great place (perhaps can be considered a Phoenix institution) where you receive plenty of food at a decent price.",

    "text": "Alright, I'll admit I've been driving past Red Devil for a decade now and always wondering what it was all about. It was always busy, seemingly always open, and really odd looking enough that it drew my interest.   After all these years, I finally decided to try Red Devil only because it was time I actually stopped, and I had a craving for spinach and artichoke dip. Upon walking in, it was obvious this place has been here forever. It's a relic, and it probably hasn't been remodeled since, well... ever. They still have the light up signs for hte order numbers, and the entire restaurant feels like a cave. It's reminiscent of all those old school Mexican restaurants you find scattered around town with no windows, etc. We were friendily greeted twice upon entry and seated almost instantaneously. The crowd was mixed, but one thing everyone had in common is it was almost an entirely blue collar lunch break crowd. There were some people from Honeywell, and some contractors, as well as some teachers.   The appetizer spinach and artichoke dip was very tasty... if not a bit overly greasy but with the right amount of fat, salt, and other artery clogging goodness. I ordered the lunch special small cheese pizza, and at the table was also a small white pizza. The red sauce pizza was average, with a very sweet sauce, a tough crust as if it had been made earlier in the day but overall a \"it's low quality but oh so tasty\" kind of taste to it. The white pizza had no olive oil, no garlic, no anything outside of breat and cheese. It was cheesy bread, make no mistake.   Overall, I thought the food was average if not slightly below average, but there is something about Red Devil that made me feel comfortable here and welcome. The staff was friendly, there was no sense that you were being judged... it was just a good happy experience... with sub standard but still acceptable food. I walked out the door under $30 including tip for an appetizer, two pies, and two iced teas. I felt it to be very reasonable.",

The accompanied sauce was just more of a magnified flavor of mushrooms which repelled rather than delight this diner. This sauce should be 86'd altogether and replaced with a more appealing marinara. The restaurant itself is tired and old and in sore need of upgrade and redecoration. The service is very s-l-o-w but cordial when you get it.

Well, Danny had nothing but excuses about the INEXCUSABLE bad service, long wait for food, (though they were nearly empty) and his feeble attempt at trying to make it our problem, only made matters worse. The understaffing is not the concern of the customer, \"Danny\" and is completely a management problem. In all reality I thought he was the dishwasher.

They have a pizza and wings special for $26 and it's the BEST pizza in town. I've been to the other locations but for some reason the pizza and wings taste best here. I live in the far west valley and I make the trip all the way to east Phoenix to enjoy their pizza. If you're ever in the area I would recommend the pizza and wings special to anyone.",

    "text": "This is another place that is commonly suggested by friends that we end up going to, only to be disappointed afterwards.  Its a loud, boisterous sprawling place with a bar and plenty of large tables. Service is pretty good, and they handle large parties well.  The food...is uninspired and bland. The bread is commercial (not made in-house) but pretty tasty.  The red sauce is...pretty bad. Its watery and seems to have no spice to it, certainly no detectable garlic or oregano. The pasta was overcooked and the minestrone (supposed to be a specialty) was uninspired.  The veal parmigiana was HORRID. Pounded so flat that frying made it tasteless like a piece of breaded cardboard, covered in cheese and that tasteless sauce. The spaghetti side was forgettable. My wife's fettuccine alfredo was watery the first time and too thick the second, and both times gritty.  Next time we're dragged here I'm going to try the pizza, which actually looks good...they'll need to impress me quite a bit for me to ever actually suggest this place on my own.",

Anyway, I went by Red Devil last night to pick up a pizza after getting out of continuing ed at 8:00. I had ordered a half cheese half Mediterranean pizza (spinach, ricotta, garlic, tomato). The pizza was 16$...a little pricey, but not for a specialty pizza. I brought the pizza home and unfortunately it was on the cold side (always a hazard when picking up a pizza) and they didn't include any crushed red pepper in the box (I guess I should have asked). Anyway, the pizza was good, but it was a bit too garlicky....and from me, that is a statement (I'm a huge garlic lover). The garlic stayed in my mouth after brushing my teeth so strongly it was hard to fall asleep....kind of a funny thing. Anyway, I will probably return here, but it isn't at the top of my list for pizza.",

Waitress said it took a little longer, 5-6 minutes longer, since it was gluten free. We all finished our food, all of our drinks were empty and we didn't see the waitress since she dropped the food off and still no pizza! She finally brought it out and of course we boxed it, paid and left! She NEVER once apologized and she kept making excuses as to why it took so long- oven was way in the back and there were a lot of catering orders! Anyways if she would have just told us the truth-that she or cook forgot it  we would have left happy customers but that's what makes the difference between a good waitress and a bad one! Still love your pizza! Hated our experience tonight! We did give her a \"written\" tip and maybe this won't happen again!!!",

I had soup and fettucine alfredo, one of my favorite dishes. It wasn't as great as others I have had, but it still hit the spot! Our server was very friendly and we had very prompt service, especially for the rush hour at lunch. This place is not fancy at all but they had good food and service, so if you're looking for a decent and filling meal for lunch, I'd recommend Red Devil on McDowell.",

They often have a 25 dollar special which includes 20 wings and a large pizza or some kind of 2 pizza wing combo for around 40 dollars. I'd recommend this spot to anyone looking for some family fun times surrounded with fun people and good food.",

Red Devil is pretty close in terms of quality and it's a lot more laid back.  During our last visit, we sat in back. The space has several nice little tucked away areas so everywhere has a nice private feel. Our waitress was really nice and accomodating and was with us in just over a minute.  Some of the fancier drinks were recommended, but we were content with just plain old lemonade. Just the right balance of sweet and tangy.  The bruschetta arrived quickly fresh out of the oven. The oil and tomatoes were spilling over the top and had a very rich flavor.  The Italian pizza was just right temperature wise and the green olives added a nice salty kick to the sausage.  The prices are reasonable. The staff is great and the pizza is delicious.   Plus we met a 6 year old in the parking lot who claimed to be a princess. How great is that?",

The wings are solid, and good for a group to share ($27 for 40 wings).  The honey heat wings are better than the original flavor wings, but both are above average  The salad is standard bagged mix greens and bottled dressing.  Move on.    The pizza - decent crust, but totally lacking flavor.  The cheese, sauce and toppings amounted to nothing.  Better than domino's (what isn't?), but lots of better options for checkered tablecloth style pizza.  Entrees were huge.  Chicken Parm was crisp and moist but again had no flavor.  The red sauce was also just plain and the side of pasta was overcooked.  Another guest got the Chicken Marsala and there was agreement it was better than the Parm.  The room is barely decorated and unmemorable.  We got there at 5 on a Sunday and the place was packed full.  My party of 8 was squished uncomfortably into a table against the wall.  It must be noted our server was extremely nice, prompt and thorough.",

We were seated immediately and greeted by our server Alberto. Wow, this guy had a golden personality and was working his station like a champ. He was making great conversation with every table and attended to us like royalty.   We ordered the fried zucchini & mushroom plate and a medium pepperoni pizza. The friend zucchini and shrooms were very tasty and we were provided plenty of ranch for dipping.  Our pizza was delivered to our table still bubbling and with a warning from Alberto, \"Now you two take it easy, this pizza is Super HOT and I can tell you from experience because I no longer have the roof of my mouth, Enjoy\". So I lifted the toasty-melty-saucy slice up to my face, hoisted it into my mouth, sank my fangs into it, and almost fainted with pleasure. I swear I could hear Lou Rawls singing in my ear as I worked my way down the slice to the crust.   This was one hell of a Pizza and a great price to boot. Dinner (Appetizer, Pizza, and Root Beer) for two under 20 bucks. I may have to give in and be a repeat offender next week. Oh well, I'll just tell them the Devil made me do it.",

I ordered wings (well done) and spinach and artichoke dip. He said the chicken park was just ok. The cheese was like a large semi melted slice of mozzarella. Sauce was ok. Not wowed, but cool for a \"we just got off the plain and wanted to eat\". It comes with a size of fries. Broccoli or spaghetti, he ordered fries. They were decent. My Wings were ok as well. Bbq. Cooked well done. I kinda expected a little crisp, but nope. Spinach dip was like sauteed spinach with light cream. Definitely not what I was expecting. Was more of a side dish than a starter/appetizer  not a place I'd rush back to.",

    "text": "We've always loved Red Devil. My family has been eating here for years. Tonight, my son broke his leg. I decided to order pizza when he was discharged. I was having a bit of an issue ordering through the Yelp app. It had taken a few minutes and I got a bit frustrated. So, I decided to call and order. My call was answered at 9:31. I was asked what I wanted. I stated I wanted to place an order. The young lady on the phone told me it was too late and I had missed \"last call.\" It was at 9:30 and they close at 10.   What?   It was 9:32 when we hung up. I went back on the app and was able to place my order. If we weren't hungry, tired (I'd been up since 4:30 am after 2 hrs of sleep) and my son didn't have his heart set on pizza, I wouldn't have bothered. There are TONS of other places that will allow a customer to order food while the place is actually open. I placed a $51.00 order that I won't be placing again. If the customer isn't first, I can find a restaurant with a more customer friendly policy. Even if it makes their Friday night later.   Thanks for making my night that much harder lady.   Follow up. I was actually nice and originally gave 3 stars just because of the relationship to this place. But when I got here, my order that I had to place online, the one I was having trouble with in the first place, was WRONG. So I had to spend another $17.00 for another pizza. What's weird is that when I was waiting at the window, people came up to order. The guy at the counter told me that they don't stop taking orders until 11 on weekends. WTH Brenda. Don't you want to help keep long-time, loyal customers. The guy at the window also originally told me that I ordered from the wrong place. I called bRenda and verified the address and phone number. NOT ONE person offered to make any of this right in any way. No discount, no soda while I waited. Nothing. I'm now waiting for another pizza. And spent $70.00. Customer for more than 25 years and I'm NEVER coming back.",

In any case, it was an unprofessional way to deal with the situation.  It took about 10 minutes for our actual waiter to come to ask us what we wanted to drink. Still he answered our questions well, even if they didn't turn out to be 100% factual, he helped stear our decisions. There were spicy honey wings that we were interested in, but I can't stand the chilli vinegar taste/smell of buffalo sauce...I asked him, \"Is it light on the buffalo and heavy on the honey?\" he answered yes. INCORRECT. Probably the strongest buffalo tasting/smelling chicken I've even been close to. I had to push it further to the other side of the table to keep my eyes from watering.  Oh and Faux news...err I mean Fox not-really News was playing on the TV in the bar :/  Lame. I'm not going back.",

I thought maybe it was just our server until I heard the server at the next table refer to her diners as sweetie and hun. Not a bad thing at all. Just kind of funny.

I rephrased the question.. No we dont have anything gluten free.. I asked.. Salad? She replied oh yeah i guess that is gluten free.. so anyways.. I have been gluten free for a couple years now so i can pick out things i know i can eat and what i cant.  I ended up ordering.. Salad - no croutons please... of course, the salad came out with croutons... i sent it back asking for one without.   Wings came out after entrees...  food was mediocre at best.

Red Devil Pizza is at the top of my list for great NY style pizza. Forgetting fancy pizza, this place offers really tasty pizza, at a good price for what you get. Red Devil uses quality ingredients, and doesn't 'church it up' (with apologies to Joe Dirt).  If you are ready for an extra treat, ask for your pie to be 'well done', that gets you a bit of char on the crust, and takes it from good to great. The guys behind the takeout window work hard to make some of the best pie in the 602, so enjoy!",

Can't get any better than that. Their BBQ sauced wings are amazing on a dish. They're known for their perfect ranch sauce and fresh dinner rolls. I'm not big on hot wings, but my dad devours their hot wings every time we go, so they much be good!   Great place to go and always great service!",

On a Saturday night my husband and I went to try this place.  We were really impressed they had a to go window so we didn't have to go inside to order.  We ordered a pizza with half cheese and the other half had sausage,  bacon,  and pepperoni.  We also ordered a small cesar salad and half order of buffalo wings. The food was done in 15 minutes.  Really quick service for a Saturday night.  The pizza was pretty good. A little too greasy but overall it was tasty. I like the crust on the pizza. Also, the ceasar salad was really good. I really liked the dressing. My husband ate the wings and he said it was pretty good. Not too spicy and good flavor.  Overall I was happy with our food.  We will definitely be back to try something different.",

The pizza is just as good as the one up off of Bell Road and the 51 however, with super fresh ingredients.  The 10 inch Supreme pizza is perfect for one, and too good to leave just that last slice behind!  They have more tables than booths here, but the ambience is nice and quiet and the parking lot is large enough that finding a place isn't a problem.    Although this location is probably closer to where I live than the one in north Phoenix, I probably will only hit this spot if I'm in the neighborhood doing something else as unfortunately the roads down in this area are a mess, and driving around down here is sort of playing Russian Roulette with my insurance.",

    "text": "First, they are open at 9:30 in a Sunday night...pretty busy too.  I would call them an Italian restaurant with a nice pizza selection.   I was tempted to try the Trio but went for the Chicken De Parma on the \"Favorites\" menu.  You get a choice of pasta.  I went traditional with the spaghetti.   I got a side salad with oil and vinegar.   It was fine.  Nothing special but it was cold and so was the plate.  The staff was attentive.   My main was good. The artichoke hearts were s bit too pronounced and I think the prosciutto was thin sliced ham; it worked.   The \"bread\" that came with dinner was a dinner roll and some butter.   I had expected garlic bread or, at least, garlic butter.  Am I glad I found this place? Yes.  Would I come back?  If it were late on a Sunday and I was out this way, probably.  One disturbing thing.  The couple at the next table had a coupon for a special.  The bill rang too high.  They talked with Carol (owner) who agreed the tab was a couple of dollars high but said, \"That's what came out of the computer and I can't change it.\" They paid the higher price and left.  I would have held out for something.  A to-go drink or something",

They were dried out, bland, no seasoning and for some reason our wing sauce was on the side. When we got back to work we had to pour the sauce In the wing box and then shake the wings to get them wet. It was pleasant.

Our server, and every server we saw which was many, were very pleasant and had no trouble saying \"You're Welcome\" in response to a Thank you.  Crazy how many people in the service respond to a Thank you with \"yeah, no problem\".  Full bar/wine/beer.  Drinks poured deep and pricing is fair for a restaurant.  On the darker side for atmosphere and also a tad warm.  Dress lightly.  TV's with sports on all over but no sound so it doesn't disturb you.  Now the pizza...  Wow!  The waitress told us they've been using the same Pizza ovens the entire 55 years and the recipe for the crust has never changed during that time.  I believe it... when something is right, don't screw with it!  Outstanding pizza crust with an excellent crunch on the outside with a chewy texture and no crumbling of crust to the table.  A very large selection of toppings too.  I decided to be a little unconventional and went with Red Onion, Hamburger, and Green Chile.  Outstanding!  These guys are going on my Pizza LIST.",

I wouldn't come here to dine-in, based on the quality of the pizza I've had (at least three times, if not more).  There's an enormous selection of quality Italian restaurants north of here that I would recommend, including Pat's Pizza Plus, Federal Pizza, Spinato's, Niccoli's, and of course Bianco.",

    "text": "I remember my first red devil experience vividly. It was almost 5 years ago. I was having one of those typical really crappy IT industry days. The NOC was slammed with calls and of course all from the worst of the worst customer wise. My manager at the time says he has something to make the day better. Takes off for about 45 minutes. I didn't know what to expect... hookers? blow?... no.. its a huge pizza and a giant pile of wings.  Holy crap these wings are AMAZING even with the steam effect you get when you take out wings. They are super crispy and sauce is the baseline hot/vinegary/buttery awesomeness by which  I measure other wings. Their ranch is absolutely amazing and they are not stingy with it. Enough left over to dip pizza in afterward for the ultimate in glutton. I always go for the hot but their other flavors are good. If  you want a real treat just ask them not to sauce the wings and get a few sides of dipping sauce. The teriyaki they coat their chicken in for their oriental salad makes a GREAT wing dip.  The pizza crust is super crunchy and has an amazing flavor, cheese is nice and greasy, and the toppings are good quality. The sauce is a little flat but I can look past it considering all the other pros.  If you are lucky enough to dine in the wings are even better and they will serve you these delicious pizza bread rolls. They tear like string cheese and are always fresh. Sometimes they come right out of the oven mmmmm.  I have never once encountered a rude server. Service has always been at least 3.5 stars.. mostly 4.5 or 5. This is just a fun place to go and a great family restaurant.  This is a valley icon/staple and has been around long before I was even a thought. Apparently we have some family history. This used to be my uncles college stomping groups and Tee Pee used to be my dads. Guess love of the local grease pits is hereditary.",

Now that we have moved downtown we finally decided to give the original Red Devil on McDowell a try.  I was surprised and I'll just say \"what a great place'!  Our server was Jenny . . . very pleasant and didn't hover over you.  We had our usual \"Supremo\" all meat pizza (pepperoni, sausage, canadian bacon and hamburger).  it was so good and tasted so close to what we had grown to love at our old stompin' grounds.  But the chicken wings were the star of the show.  Wings don't get any better that this.  Crispy, hot and I dare you to eat just one.  I'd go here just to order the wings to-go.  By the way, there is a $5 off coupon on their website.  $5 off any order of $30 or more (so get it before it expires).",

The bread was nice a toasted with a garlic cheese butter and they add fresh cold chopped tomato with fresh cut basil with a little olive oil. The pizza is great sauce taste as it should and they don't use the generic cheeses and ingredients, plus they always have great specials online and on social media. The wings are also great big and tasty with lots of sauce which I find it comparable to long wongs med sauce.  The bad Pretty common thing for me with parking but this is particularly a bad area to park and not the greatest of areas especially at night have seen some seedy people.  Overall this place is a Phoenix staple and great for dates I would recommend it.",

Would have given more starts- but the customer service desperately needs work. Sat for close to 25 minutes before anyone came to ask if we needed drinks or had been helped. Plenty of servers walked past our table and saw us just sitting and staring waiting to be helped. Asked a waitress who passed us if we could order since we where ready and was told \"we'll get you your server to take your order,\" and did it happen? No. Was there an apology? No. The staff acted as if the customer was bother. Not a busy night for them either.",

I love to get a side of ranch and a side of the hot wing sause and dip this pizza in. Mmmmm my mouth is watering just writing this. The wings are damn good too.

We were immediately greeted, and they put our names down and we waited. Was about a 20 minute wait, so honestly not as bad as I had expected considering how busy they were. We were offered water to drink while we waited. We were seated at a nice clean table, and our server this time was Jonathan. The love got a cherry Pepsi (well a Pepsi with cherry flavoring or something like that because they didn't have cherry Pepsi but were more than willing to make it) and I got an extremely delicious sangria with cherries in it and that tasted more amazing than any other drink I have ever had. We shared an order of 10 mild wings (the spicy sauce mixed with barbeque so it was amazing) then I ordered the trio which came with chicken Parmesan, pasta alfredo (which I added shrimp) and cheese raviolis. The chicken was good, the alfredo was good, and the shrimp were simply amazing. The ravioli was also good, I have zero complaints about my food except for the fact that I don't have any left lol. There was definitely enough for two meals though, which I did end up taking home and doing. Josh got a chicken Parmesan sandwich, and that sammich was so big he was stuffed even though he hadn't eaten all day. I finished the meal up with a piece of their amazing cheesecake, and I must say it was a great Valentine's Day. Wings: $7.50ish for 10, sangria:$7 Trio:$14(I think....) Sammich: $8 Cheesecake: $4. Oh also, the trio comes with soup, and you should try the clam chowder...yum. So food was great, price wise, about average for a fancier Italian place, and service was amazing. Even under all the stress of the day, our server never once lost his patience, and continued to be helpful, friendly, and informative the entire night. Also, something I don't usually see at restaurants, the manager was walking around checking up on everything. We'll be back.",

It was very fruity , with just the right amount of dryness.    My husband ordered a large, thin crust cheese pizza and I ordered a spinach and strawberry salad with grilled chicken breast.  Now I am not one to brag about a salad, in fact it's very, very rare for me to even order a salad, but that night a salad made sense so I went ahead.  Man, am I glad I did...  It was the most amazing salad I've ever had.  EVER.  The chicken breast was a quality cut and grilled perfectly, and the salad greens were flavorful and crunchy and the strawberries were sweet, fresh and delicious and the whole salad was dressed in an amazing, light and tangy dressing that was almost non-existent in appearance, but exploded in flavor on the first bite.  I can't explain it better than that.  It was just the freshest, most flavorful salad ever.    My husband enjoyed his cheese pizza quite a bit as well, but he still found room to steal about half of my salad off my plate too!",

I finally stopped in with some friends for dining, they arrived first I was the last to get there we ordered shortly after that (nothing fancy) and our food arrived about an hour and fifteen minutes later - apparently they blame the chicken parmesan as the culprit for the time delay. Other tables got their food in a reasonable amout of time and yes the place from not bust to very busy while we were there, but still our food order went in first.  Then, it was as if the 5 guys in the middle of the room went invisible and no one came buy. I have the grilled sausage sandwich and it was okay, wasn't the best Ive ever had.  I think I'll stick to pizza from this place and leave the dining alone.",

More like NY or Boston style. The ambiance is a bit old school, looks like they have had the same wooden tables and chairs for the past 30 years, but I do like it. It has an old school Phoenix vibe, which there aren't many places that have that anymore. They also have good lunch specials.",

The pizza was just not good. Nothing about it was appetizing. The middle was soggy and the crust was soo crisp and crunchy it was inedible. My kids didn't even  like it. The sauce was pastey and tasted off. It was overall just bad. We had a whole pie left over from 6 people. The pizza was even worse the next day, and we love cold left over pizza. We ended up just throwing it out. Won't be back to this pizza joint.",

    "text": "I have been coming to this place since I was in Kindergarten. The thing I like most about this place is you can see the pizza being made right in front of you. Outside of the restaurant they toss up the dough, work those arms, place the pizza sauce and toppings and place it in the oven. As a child this was my favorite part about coming to the restaurant. I could sit there all day and night watching them make pizzas. Now as an adult, I bring my children here because this place is a special place where I shared many childhood memories with my father. My kids love their pizza and wings. Although I have only ordered two other different things on the menu ever, I stay traditional with the pizza and wings.   Their food is your average, nothing short of your neighborhood Italian restaurant. They could use a remodel inside. Service is always with a smile and food comes to your table in a timely manner. If you are visiting this place on a Friday or Saturday evening, you may need to bring a couple of extra minutes with you for the wait time. My children and I continue to make happy memories here and I hope they continue to do the same when they have their children.",

The outside order window can't be beat, and I don't know of any other place like it...the only thing missing is an outdoor place to sit and eat.  Last night (Saturday) was a typical busy night, and I appreciated the attitude and patience of the employees, as the entryway is tight and crowded and not a lot of places to sit and wait for a table, let alone stand. Fortunately it had stopped raining and waiting outside was an option.  The pizza was better than expected and I was surprised it was as flavorful and fresh as I remembered. I guess I shouldn't be, for Red Devil is still around and as popular, if not more so, than it was back when I was a teenager and didn't appreciate quality like I do now...oh, and my 3 yr old granddaughter thought the cheese pizza was great!

I was in the area tonight and decided to hit the old place up with a buddy (fellow yelper Joey L.) of mine. Upon entering, I remembered the place like it was yesterday. How, you ask? That would be because it looks the same inside as it did a million years ago. That may bother a few, but I love the old time feel. It brings you back to going to a restaurant for the food and food only. As for the grub, my friend and I started by knocking out an order of 10 wings coated in their medium NY sauce. I had to ask our waitress what the sauce was made of because it was that good. She stated the sauce is a combo of hot sauce, butter, and vinegar. Whatever it was, I wanted more. For dinner we had the Devil Special Pizza, which included pepperoni, sausage, onion, green pepper, and mushroom. The pizza was great. The crust was soft and firm in all the right places; while the cheese was very cheesy, and the meat was very flavorful. Definitely one of the better pizzas I have had in some time. On a side note, the ranch provided for the wings was very good and was not watered down as many pizza joints seem to do these days. Since I use ranch on my pie, it's a big deal to this guy. Overall, a very nice meal.",

    "text": "Worst Chicken Parm of my life!! No kidding, it was greasy and cold when I got it. The alfredo was sort of gritty, but the cheese ravioli was ok (you could tell that it was pre-made). I went because my friend said it was good pizza, but I wanted to try a little of everything. If there's a next time I will stick to the pizza.",

    "text": "Absolutely terrible. And I haven't even received my food yet, but it's been so bad that I need to leave a 1 star before I go crazy.  We were told a ten to fifteen minute wait. It was 40 minutes. Waiting was in the bar with super loud, rude, obnoxious people.   After 35 minutes, the hostess sat another group who came in after us. Did I mention I was with my mother and 4 month old baby? When we were finally sat, the waitress was nice but SLLLOOWWWW. We put in orders for waters and 2 beers. They came out in about 15 minutes. While we were waiting for drinks and food, we saw another party get up and leave. The clueless manager shook her head and said, \"why would anyone leave?\". If you had bothered to stop at our table and talk to us (even though you talked to the tables around us?), you would have known.   My wife ordered some fried mushrooms and zucchini. Below average to pretty bad. Her salad was eh. We got a standard pizza, and it was bad. Soggy in the middle, too dry on the crust. The sauce was mediocre and the sausage was pretty gross.   It was just a bad overall experience. Do NOT go here.",

    "text": "Ok, did they use Nacho Cheese on my $17.00 pasta dish? That's what it tasted like. Pasta Florentine should be called Pasta Quarantine...I guess I could go one step up and say that what ever that sauce was tasted like melted Velvita cheese. It was one or the other according to my taste buds. It was goopy and gross.  Husband said his Veal Parmesean was completely flavorless. Son said his Chicken Broccoli Alfredo was boring and over cooked. We probably spent $75.00+ on one of the worst Italian meals we've ever had. We'll stick with the pizza from now on...it's pretty good. But every pasta dish I've had there is over priced and completely misses the whole idea of good Italian food. I cook much better than that!! Why do I keep trying just one more time? Ugh.... Never again. Too many other places to eat with good Italian dishes now days. Took more than half home because I couldn't eat one more bite without feeling disgust for wasting my money. Most likey will toss it in about two days.",

    "text": "Would have been nice if we actually got the food. We called to place it girl answered and said hang on ill transfer you, few mins later another girl answers giving us a number to call. Why does one tell us we can be transferred and another gives us a different number? But my real problem was we did eventually call the right number and the guy told us 25 to 30 mins. We get there and they haven't even started it.  My suggestion if you don't want to wait for over an hr for carryout go elsewhere.",
