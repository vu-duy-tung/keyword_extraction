The music is always spot on, the couches are comfy, and when you leave your clothes smell like a nice dark roast for the rest of the day (I suppose some may not like this but I rather enjoy it).   As for the coffee, prepare to get your buzz on. I always get a hell of a pick me up from my go to Cartel Americano. Exceptional flavor, fresh, and just as good iced as it is hot, they rarely disappoint. My only complaint is the cost, but considering their support of local art and business, I can deal with the additional charge.",

    "text": "It's a Cartel Coffee alright. Mmmmyep. Drinks can vary in consistency depending on who the barista is, (sometimes my mochas have a little too much milk in them, but not by a lot - other days they don't maybe) but such is life I suppose; a bit on the pricey side, but you get a quality cup. They've recently started to foray into teas and the Oolong they served on one occasion was one of the best cups of tea I've had in a while... Though on another day, they served the same Oolong in a pint glass at far too hot of a temperature.. I let that slide though. In the shop they feature local art; last month ago or so they were lithographs of an E100 Corolla and a Previa, two of the most passionless yet innovative examples of Japanese auto engineering in the 1990's... Though that exhibit was actually about the artist's dad. At any rate, this month(?) they're featuring some local furniture pieces and Heavy Pedal track bicycles. It truly is a very eclectic display sometimes. Today, the cream pattern in my mocha looked like a dong.  Parking can be a bit difficult as it is on 5th ave with all the Indian jewelry, souvenir and what-have-you shops, so getting a cup in around lunchtime can be a bit difficult if you're a motorist. Interestingly enough, the pavement on 5th ave is pretty friendly for skateboards (as in, actual skateboards; though cruisers/longboards can absorb the pavement just fine), so provided cars watch out for you (which is unlikely in the wintertime due to snowbirds in addition to the typical elderly folk), it's a pleasant time to just skate on over.",

The dudes are nice, but must be lacking any previous cafe experience. The place is super busy on a Saturday morning, but due mainly to the exceptionally slow service. Lets do some numbers. We walked in at 10am, waited in line until twenty past, and still didn't have a coffee in our hands by 11. Then after much fumbling and confusion, they lost our order twice before informing us that the grinder was broken. We went down the road and had a great coffee from the ice cream shop in no less than five minutes. Perhaps this place really is a lab fronting as a cafe.",

It's half price during happy hour, you don't say?  Well, I'll have a slice then!   My cup arrived first, and it was a beauty, so cameras came out.  Soon after, V's and cuzzo's beverages and the cake arrived. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fa1G6WoSdvAO8dzM4FYbUA?select=oNUYZx9Eoo0dUE8Qa_lqkQ#oNUYZx9Eoo0dUE8Qa_lqkQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fa1G...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fa1G6WoSdvAO8dzM4FYbUA?select=4EqJGPxNYxB6-tek3iRPQA#4EqJGPxNYxB6-tek3iRPQA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fa1G...</a>  I offered first bites- V declined and cousin dug in, but only to find that it was \"a bit dry.\"  I concurred, but I figured I could just chase the bites down with sips of my delicious cappuccino.  V enjoyed hers, even though she forgot to have them add sugar.  (No biggie... she was able to add later.)  Cousin could hardly taste the honey in her latte, so she visited the sugar station.  She eventually had to abandon her drink when it became too sweet to finish-- all the honey she couldn't taste apparently had settled on the bottom.  I'm thinking this is going to be a tradition of mine when HH'ing in OTS.  :)  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fa1G6WoSdvAO8dzM4FYbUA?select=WnJrcqqxqDUrVBJ6-70yUQ#WnJrcqqxqDUrVBJ6-70yUQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fa1G...</a>",

Lots of seating (mostly tables and chairs, but some backless couches line the sides), plus a cozy, dog-friendly side patio.  The drink menu is simple - lots of coffees but not a huge selection of weird ways to have them (no almond milk, but they do have soy).  A few teas, hot cocoa (yay!), and they are now serving beer as well (pretty tasty stuff).  It's been quiet on my visits, which is lovely for reading, and the music is soft but awesome.  I haven't tried the food beyond the cookies (which are decent in a pinch but too dry to be scrumptious to this dessert snob).",

Stepping in the atmosphere is entirely different and welcoming. With a nice modern industrial design and a clean lobby. The coffee and espresso drinks are top notch and where before I could only take coffee with plenty of sugar and cream now with them I don't need any of that. They've opened my tastebuds up to how good coffee can actually be. So if you're reading this and want to expand your tastes away from quick cheap coffee give Cartel a try, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "The best coffee Arizona has to offer!  Cartel Coffee Lab does it all. They send their roaster down to South/Central America to source great coffee, they roast coffee themselves in Tempe, AZ and they brew the coffee in a way that respects the chemistry of the bean and ensures the resulting cup is of the highest quality. Other AZ cafes come close, often offering great cups of coffee, but none are as involved in the process from farm to cup as Cartel is! Trust me, you, the customer, are the beneficiary of all their crazy coffee worship.  Cartel also has several cafes that all have their own unique personality. This 5th Ave location in Old Town is one of the friendliest, most welcoming and relaxing of their cafes. Great place to get work done and the baristas seem to cater to the crowd in setting the ambiance. If everyone's in with friends getting (alcoholic) beverages then the music will be turned up a bit and more upbeat, if everyone's got their laptops out or their nose buried in a book the music will be a bit more calm.   My favorite drinks are any of their hand-brewed coffees, the cappuccino, the cortado and the one-and-one (ask your barista!).  Oh, and I could rant for an hour about why complaints about price are irrational but i'll keep it short. Coffee is an agricultural product that requires an ENORMOUS amount of work to grow and process. If you take a second to think about where your coffee comes from and all the hands that work to bring it to you, you'll wonder why each cup doesn't cost $10 and each bag doesn't cost $50!",

After living in the Northwest (Seattle area) for a long while we've grown accustomed to outstanding coffee (NOT starbucks) and this place was great.  Atmosphere was really unique and laid back as well with semi-outdoor seating.  I also noticed they have a small but legit beer selection.  When I was there they had on tap Odell Mercenary IPA, Firestone Velvet Merlin, and a few others.  Whoever orders their beers obviously knows what good beer is.  We didn't end up getting any but a good sign nonetheless.  Service was good and they were friendly.  We ended up buying a mug because they are pretty cool too.  Overall, superb place to stop in and have a leisurely coffee.  Definitely going back next time we are in the Dale",

Although I frequented this location's former coffee shop many times during its existence, I had yet to visit the new Cartel Coffee Lab when it opened...until today. I realize what I've been missing and I won't make that mistake again. The location was cool before, but now with the Cartel touch, it's even cooler. The coffee is the delicious Cartel coffee blend and the vibe is eclectic and coffee shop'esque. But here's a nice twist courtesy of Cartel's elves. Besides basic baked goods, they also serve a simple breakfast and lunch menu.   The breakfast menu includes items such as breakfast sandwiches and oatmeal. The lunch menu includes items such as a turkey sandwich with a delicious pesto sauce, a ham sandwich and salads like tuna salad. It's a small menu but it's good. Plus you get chips, a salad or fruit with your lunch sandwich. Add a non-fat vanilla latte and you've got yourself a delicious lunch, or at least I did!   Seating is slightly limited but you should be able to find a seat on a basic work day. Plus, the vibe is comfortable and perfect to sit and work (as long as you're ok with community tables).",

Very reasonable prices, friendly staff, and PLENTY of seating! Indoors, outdoors, I'd be surprised if you came here and couldn't find seat! They have a side patio and a back room behind the ordering counter.  Haven't had any of the beer or wine, but I love the idea of mixing coffee shop and bar lounge, creates a sweet atmosphere for whatever youre feeling!",

I've been hitting up Cartel for the past few years, and I can honestly say I have not, and do not plan on buying beans from anywhere else. Their coffee is just solid amazing quality. I don't live in Old Town anymore, and if I ever wander down there, it's either to see friends or to buy more coffee beans from Cartel. I have tried a few of their pastries in the past as well, but I always get an iced latte and a bacon pretzel when I come. Bits of bacon jammed into a pretzel...what could be better?!  I've always found the service to be fast and extremely friendly, but parking can be a little tricky. There's lots of street parking, and a garage nearby, but in Old Town, that doesn't really mean much since it's always packed. Love this place though!",

The taste was not all that exceptional and it didn't give me an energy surge like my usual black coffee. I'll have to go back and try some of their other more unique options under \"filter\" and espresso. Overall, it was a good alternative if you don't want boring ol' Starbucks.

I loved that he poured my drink in a tall glass, a real one, and topped it off with an artistic design. The only complaint was that it tasted lukewarm to warm and not near hot. The second visit the Barista made it twice (I think he may have been new), put it in a to go cup instead of a glass, and once again it was lukewarm and unfortunately was not a good taste.   Pros- great location off the main strip away from the tourists. Good atmosphere with nice music, good seating, wifi, etc. Awesome hours of operation- most of the area shuts down at 5 on a Sunday night but this place goes through 9. Thus my reasons for giving it four stars, I mean come on- until 9 on a Sunday!  Cons- latte's are not super hot, more on the warm side and pastries look better than they taste.",

    "text": "I have only been here once so you can take my review or leave it but first impressions do matter. I was looking for a coffee shop alternative that wasn't a big chain like coffee bean so I researched this place and watched their video on their website that made this place sound good. Aye, am I so gullible or what? Of course the video on the business' website is going to make their own business sound good.  Anyway, walked into Cartel and immediately was thrown by the hipsters sitting around chatting by the front door window as they were the mannequins to advertise the store. I hoped there would be no hipsters but that's exactly what I found at this place.  I ordered a green tea for $3.75. Eh.  The guy at the counter starting babbling about tea infusions and such that I really didn't care about. I once paid $4.25 for a tea but I at least understood why because they bagged their own tea. Now this one was just as expensive but it was just tea leaves and water, not even hand bagged or anything. I'm not completely poor so I didn't care as much about the price, but what really got me was that the ambience was so poor that I had to leave with my $3.75 tea since I just could not work in this place.   I had planned to do some creative work on my lap top and I wanted my own little space, even a small table to myself would have been fine, but no. They have bean bag-like cushion chairs on the sides with a low table that in no way resembles a desk and the only other seating is basically long benches you have to share with others. No personal space. I could see this place being really great for collaborative meetings or even social interactions, but that's not what I was looking for today.  I was looking for a cute, little non-chain coffee shop, not too loud, where I could work on a creative project. Didn't find that in here. The energy was just a little weird, from the seating to the staff, I just couldn't spend another minute. I got my tea to go and left and was pissed that I even bought the tea in the first place because I could have spent $3.75 in another place with better ambience.  But after letting the tea steep, it was decently flavored. It's not much to making tea though. Like I said earlier, take it or leave it. But I'll never go back in here again.",

I have bought beans from them to brew on the weekends, which is almost just as good as when they make it.",

The girl who was working yesterday was awesome, very friendly and we had a nice conversation. The decor has a similar vibe to the downtown location, modern....not as 'cool' as the Tempe location, but nice with a lot of community style tables. I would definitely recommend this shop over some of the other Scottsdale options!",

A little darker than I like, especially where the pastries are since you can barely see them..  Which is why I asked the guy what they were and turned out they were actually 3 items spread out over 6 display risers.  A little sign or something to hint at what these items were would definitely help the ordering process.  Especially if the worker missed the delivery and had no idea what was in them..    So we order 2 black coffees and turns out they didn't have enough to fill the tiny tiny cups for both so they say it'll take a few minutes while they brew it I guess manually?  They have the Aeropress (which is what we use at home), and various sized drip contraptions which I'm assuming they went with to make our coffee.    The coffee was a bit sour, which happens when the coffee is under brewed.  We do it ourselves at home once in a while, but we're not paying 2.50 per Dixie cup.  The scone was actually pretty decent but I was looking for a pastry, not the limited option of scone, muffin or cookie.  Even so, I wouldn't rate so low if the coffee was good at the coffee shop.",

It took all of the baristas no more than 3 trips from me before they knew what I wanted and had it ready by the time it was my turn to pay. As I always state, attention to detail is what sets a business apart and Cartel is fully focused on the details.  They boast a strong pastry section with the chocolate chip cookie, my favorite, leading the way. They will accommodate any order and always have fun facts about the great coffee you're about to enjoy. They have all the best methods of brewing including the Chemex.  The one thing that sets them above all other coffee shops, besides the coffee and pastries, is the music. They are always playing the coolest playlists and they don't discriminate. I have heard everything from 2Pac to The xx to 80s jams.   After studying for 3 Bar Exams here, I can truly say there is no better place to get your coffee fix while enjoying great music and a great atmosphere.",

I really liked the coffee joint that used to be in this space, but Cartel has taken serving awesome coffee to a whole 'nutha level by serving up fresh, delicious food, beer and wine!  Since my man doesn't like coffee, I have to have something like beer to lure him into a coffee shop.  Thank you Cartel for keeping relationships together!!  We will be back!",

    "text": "There's nothing I love more than a cozy coffee shop. In Saint Louis, you can toss a quarter and hit a coffee shop, here however, it's a little more sparse....maybe a handful of quarters and you can hit a Starbucks. There's nothing wrong with Starbucks, as the owner of Cartel Coffee told us, \"there's a time for Starbucks and there's a time for a fresh, good pour\". I like her. I like this place. It works.       The decor is bare bones, industrial-esque and I love it. Two chaises by the front windows are good for lounging and beyond that, there are wooden tables, replica wooden stumps, and some outside patio seating on the side as well. It's simple, it's down to earth, and you can get a damn good cup of coffee. Their dirty chai is wonderful, the fresh pours are delicious and truthfully, the pastries I've been eying are getting harder and harder to resist. They also have a variety of beers and wines to pick from if you're working from home, grading some papers or just really need that end of the day drink.      They've been featured by BBC Travel and Food and Wine Magazine which means, maybe I'm not the only one who thinks this place is a freakin' gem in Scottsdale. I wish there were even more coffee spots like this, but I can't deny my affections for Cartel. Don't miss out on a great cup of coffee and a perfect opportunity to people watch!",

Location, location, location is key for Cartel. Old Town is Scottsdale is uber-hip, chic, and the perfect place for this hipster paradise to call home. My apples to apples comparison for my coffee cravings is black drip coffee. Cartel's offerings didn't disappoint and represented the black coffee game with style. My wife's vanilla latte was equally delicious in addition to the homemade pop tart.   There was also a great mix of patrons walking in early on a Friday morning. Professionals, touristy types (us), students, and others all came in picking up varying drinks from lattes, to cold brews, to growlers.   Will definitely scout a stop here in the future. Really enjoyed everything about my visit and will continue to patronize small coffee shops.",

For a plain black coffee, nothing fancy.  I asked if their prices went up and the person behind the counter said she didn't know.  How do you not know, I know a large coffee was $3.75 just a couple weeks ago.  Anyway, there's nothing anywhere about the 17% inflation!  I then asked if they had refills, the person at the counter said, yes but they're not free, they're about a dollar.  So I just went in to get my dollar refill and it was $2.25!  Second time in one day I was price mislead.  That's a total of 6.75 for a cup of coffee and a refill.  Again, the coffee is fine but will not return due to being misinformed on the price of my items.",

I believe it's 8oz and 16oz, but don't bite my head off of those aren't the exact sizes but two sizes regardless.  Place has a little bit of a hipster vibe, and they definitely take their time making the coffee. I know a great latte is worth a bit of a wait but this wait (with no one ahead of me) was overly long.

Many of the friendly faces I knew and loved have since moved on from this location, but their product and atmosphere is still top notch. This location is more intimate than their Tempe location which I prefer as it was easier to get to know the employees and other regulars. I highly recommend, although it is not for Dutch or Starbucks lovers.

I would have been ignorant of the fact that the *correct* temperature is precisely 20 degrees cooler than what the (ugh) general populace would prefer.

It's super cool that they also have a handful of beers on tap, one of them, Mr. Pineapple, had me drooling- it looked so good.  The ambiance is really cool and comfortable and looks like a great place to sit and chill. It would be cool if they had a few more baked goods for morning grab and goes, but there is only so much space.  Cartel is yet another great reason to support local coffee, skip the chains- and enjoy.",

    "text": "It was already scorching hot here in AZ and I wanted to stop at the Coffee shop for an ice cold drink.  I just got into town and my friend was driving into Scottsdale area.   I looked up the coffee places on Yelp on my phone and luckily found several Coffee shops on 5th Ave.   I'm glad I walked into this place out of many Coffee shops in the neighborhood after having their tasty **cookies(Chocolate/Peanut/Bacon & White Chocolate/ Macadamia) and a delicious **Chai iced latte w/soy milk :P. Their Chai iced latte was one of the best I've ever tried before!!  It's a \"trendy\" coffee shop type of place. When I walked in, there were several people  sit around either working on their laptops or reading books.  I really like their very modern style of mismatched colorful furniture.  I enjoy the chalkboard menus on the wall as well.  It seems like they serve quiet a few selection of beers and foods:)  To my surprise and amazement, they had an alcohol beverage and keep in mind, this is a coffee shop. Most notable Wow, I would never thought this place might sell beer...   A place to come and do some work on your laptop sipping coffee and then transition to beers later in the day-sounds awesome!!  Maybe some people might think it doesn't look exactly a beer destination place, but I can see myself having a glass of cold beer on a hot summer night :P.  Definitely, it's a relaxing spot to enjoy a pint, or less in my case.  Don't forget., thumbs up for the Chai Latte!",

    "text": "The experience at Cartel is exactly what you'd expect at an independent coffee shop. The locale is artsy, the interior is sparsely decorated with geometrically abnormal tables at weird heights, wood and steel stuff and an exposed wood ceiling. If you're into wood and steel, Cartel has it. They were bumping dubstepLite from the overhead speakers, which was an unexpected change from the guitar + hi high and bass drum + croaking off-key vocals that hipsters seem to love. The dudes at the counter were wearing a sufficient quantity of second-hand clothing to make me certain that they weren't employees of a corporate chain, but that they were actually fulfilling their destinies as bearded Ferrymen helping the uninitiated cross the Single Origin river into the Alterlife. Among other customers there was a distinct lack of True artistic souls, which is disappointing, but really out of the control of Cartel. No one had a typewriter, or was knitting, and only one guy had the messy dreadlocks of someone who hasn't sold out. SOMEthing needs to be done before Cartel gets a reputation of being a scene for sellouts and generics.  Enough about the scene, on to the coffee. I had a black single-origin Chemex from somewhere in the global South, and the wife had the coldbrew. The Chemex is 20 oz., which is cool, but $8~. I guess if you think of it as two coffees it makes sense, but $8~? That's almost 50 cents/ounce. \"Well, you were dumb enough to buy it,\" you might argue. Don't use your laissez-faire logic on me, I expect my independent coffee to be fair trade, not free trade. Still, the flavor was mild and spicy, and the mouthfeel...whatever, it tasted like good coffee. The wife's coldbrew was good, but also a little overpriced. Cream is kept under the tight control of the bearded Ferrymen, probably to keep it fresh, and is served infused with non-verbal judgement over your poor choice of diluting the integrity of your carefully crafted beans. This bit of judgementalism restored my faith a little in Cartel. Maybe they have what it takes to be an elite hipster joint after all. Then on our way out the door I overheard one of the Ferrymen describing to Dreadlocks how one of the blends as \"totally cleanses your system,\" and reassurance washed over me. Cartel isn't just selling coffee after all. It's curing people of their ailments and helping them towards a healthier, less skeptical lifestyle.  Great for: people who enjoy the free market Not great for: people who believe in evidence based medicine",

All are medium to light roasted. The slower speed of service seemed to be a product of brewing to order.   The breakfast sandwich was good but pricey for what you got. It also had meat in the egg patty (which was not advertised on the menu). And NO condiments (salt, pepper, ketchup, hot sauce, etc). WTF?",

Having obviously grown their fan base and selections (now including breakfast/lunch/dinner/pastries) since my first visit nearly one year prior when I came out for my job interview/recruitment I still love Cartel and stand by my original assessment that both the shop and the beans compare favorably to spots in New York, Chicago, Seattle, and San Francisco - I'll have to come back some time to check out the pastries and sandwiches.",

This place has fueled my temptation to quit the 9-5 and do freelance out of a coffee shop all day! Nothing better than a dirty chai and an evening chilling on a chaise lounge chair! I almost lost all faith in Cartel after attending the Tempe location several times and getting bad vibes from the employees every visit. However I am glad I got over my \"cartel\" fear and checked out the old town location. This place is a 180 deg difference from the tempe location. I was greeted by a helpful, friendly staff that doesn't come off as coffee snobs, because their is nothing worse than a barista with an attitude. Keep up the friendly staff and great atmosphere and I will be a life long patron!  Plus they have a small but great selection of craft beers!

Not the experience I was hoping for. The homemade Pop Tart definitely salvaged the experience -- holy cow. Yum! And my wife's latte featured a solid espresso shot and even milk.

The only thing I don't like is if you get a loose leaf tea, instead of putting it in an infused, they put the leaves in a boiling cup of water which gets very bitter because it's obviously over steeped. I can't for the life of me figure out why they do this.   Otherwise it's excellent",

The place was clean and quiet, with ample seating as well as a shared courtyard patio to the west. For all of the time it had been there, I had never known, since it gets hidden in the location.  The staff was very friendly. The service was fast, and I had my beverage and muffin in no time at all. I'm torn about the whole get your own lid thing, since my drink was full to the top and it was awkward juggling my stuff, the drink and the lid and straw. Eventually I got myself coordinated.  I ordered a blueberry muffin and a large iced chai.  The 16oz. Chai was underwhelming at a whopping 5 bucks! (even overpriced Starbucks has the Grande, 16oz. At $3.65) The muffin was tasty, with nice crusty sugar on top. A bit dry, but still pleasant.  I don't know that I would spend the money for a substandard chai in the future.  While I like to support local businesses and avoid the Starbucks monster, I think I will keep looking for that right place.",

When you first walk in you'll notice there's art on the wall, and long couches, long tables. I actually love the furniture in here. There's a little indoor/outdoor hallway on the side that has a comfy couch and tables, one of which has a chess board, if you know how to play (which I don't).   Then the coffee stuff. This is what I love the most. They have all brewing methods. French press, chemex, aeropress, you name it. Not to mention a manual espresso machine and hand poured latte art. GAH!  The two guys working today are perfection. They are fun, friendly and efficient. Not to mention they make a killer latte. Yum. :)  Also, I had a blueberry muffin that made my tummy very very happy.   I love Cartel Coffee Lab. I will come back again and again.",

I know they are completely different from a place like Starbucks, but when there's 5 or 6 people in line at Cartel, it will absolutely take 20 minutes to get your drink, which is absurd and ridiculous. A place like Sbux would take 5 minutes. Let's give Cartel the benefit of the doubt with their solo machine and manual tamping. Even if you triple the time, you're still waiting longer at Cartel. Never go there if you are in a hurry. If my drink was ready just minutes after I order it, I'd be giving them 5 stars. Since they ALWAYS take forever, they get 3, it's that tough.

There is long bench-style seating in their main room which was very warm even at 9 a.m. Then there is a side \"breezeway\" area (much cooler) with standard tables but not-so-comfortable chairs. There's also a sterile looking back room if you want total quiet. There is comfortable, unobtrusive music playing in the background. The coffee offerings are limited (don't expect a Starbucks) and an even smaller offering of pastries, but they do offer local craft beers. The barrista(?) behind the counter greeted us with more of a sneer than a smile, and coldly stated they did not have the dark roast coffee I asked for but had \"lightly roasted coffee and roasted their own beans\". Sounded more like a public address announcement than a benefit. What I actually got was and expensive cup of acidic coffee. I assume they have a loyal group of local customers who prefer \"rustic\" coffee and the story that goes along with it, but I prefer a good, reasonably priced cup of coffee instead. I'll probably not return.",

They were helpful in explaining the different types of coffee that they were offering and were patient with all my questions. I normally order a pour over and expect a Chemex but they also had the aero press and the v60 which are each slightly different. I decided to give the v60 a try since it was getting late in the day and didn't want a gigantic cup to keep me up at night.   There's a standard small selection of snacks (soft pretzel/muffins). I grabbed a pretzel since I needed a light snack after dealing with overpriced airport food all day. It was pretty tasty and not too salty. There was a nice sweet savoriness that was a pleasant surprise. Though, I did not expect it to be room temperature. Still delicious though!  Now let's get to the coffee. It was smooth as a pour over often is. Lots of different subtle flavors that I enjoy from a quality pour over.   It was brought out with the coffee in a separate glass jar with a lid. Presumably it's so you can pour out what you want to drink and the rest stays hot while you sip it, which I think is a genius move.   The ambiance is very chill with lots of people working and hanging out or enjoying themselves. The WiFi is also fast and reliable.   It's definitely worth stopping by if you're in the area and need a tasty drink or a light snack.",

This is an overhyped coffee shop, thriving on popularity. This is easily apparent by a quick scan of clientele hanging out.  Now I can deal with this type of environment if the coffee is worth it. Unfortunately the coffee is miserable. The staff were overly pretentious, but maybe not their fault, just a victim of the surroundings.",

If any staff is reading this, please tell me the secret to looking cool so effortlessly... and the 365 good hair days too. Much thanks",

    "text": "Waltzed in on a late Saturday morning wearing the same outfit, wedge shoes, and makeup I'd worn the night before. And sure, maybe my hair hadn't been brushed either but hey, a girl needs her coffee. I was hesitant to stop where there wasn't a drive-thru option but I didn't want Starbucks or McDonald's coffee either. Boyfriend stops in front of the shop and lets me out. Feeling slightly self conscious, I said \"I'll take an iced breve or whatever your equivalent is,\" since I didn't see it on the menu.  The barista gave me a perplexed look and then turned to his coworker to ask what they might be able to make breve like. Next thing I knew they were asking for my credit card, charging me $5. A moment later they produced a cup filled with ice and coffee and, room for cream. I immediately resented the tip I'd left because I didn't ask for an \"iced coffee room for cream.\"  Disappointedly, I grabbed my iced coffee and looked around for the creamer station (I wasn't sure where it was as nobody had directed me). Now, I realize a breve is basically just an iced coffee with a plethora of half n half stirred to a delicious creaminess, and that I could at this point make my own breve. But for what had I tipped at this so called Coffee LAB?  When I stop at a coffee shop I expect the barista to make my drink with love and hand it to me in a way that gives me the sense that despite messy hair or sloppy makeup, it's gonna be a damn good day. Next time, I'll go through the drive-thru.",

First of all it was a bad sign when I was asking the barista to comment between two choices of coffee and she said \"I'm new here so I haven't tried all of the coffee's yet\". Now I appreciate her honesty and I understand from an average coffee drinker's perspective that's probably not a problem, however being a self proclaimed coffee snob from California I was surprised that any well deserved and respectable coffee shop would hire someone and not put them through the process of at least trying everything they have to offer. I think her pour was a bit off, The coffee was missing its unique distinctive flavor as during the brew process the water probably spent too much time in the grind. Had the pastry which was unremarkable and rest of the staff has kind of a \"Treat the regulars with more attention and gratitude then the other customers\" kind of thing 2.5 stars Btw I was so disappointed in this experience that the next day I took a 18 minute one-way Uber to Press coffee with a much much better experience.",

The price of coffee (which I don't drink) or tea isn't getting any cheaper. But $4.25 plus tax for some water and mediocre tasting tea is absolutely insane to me. Starbucks for a size twice what I got is half the price...At freakin Starbucks!!!! Before you think I'm cheap or whatever, check my pics from the meals I ate and this actually has little to with price or money. I also secretly hate Starbucks.  One it took forever to get tea. Not hard to make, right?  Fair warning I was told it would be a few minutes. Whatever. I asked if they have honey. They said no, they only have agave and some nonsense flavored corn syrup out of a pump. How do you not have honey at a place like this?  Two stars for the decent atmosphere and crappy chairs. Although I'm curious about whatever is doing on their laptops...mmmm? Plus a lot of the light bulbs were burnt out and that drives me crazy because it lacks attention to detail. It's not that hard to change a light bulb.   I'm not sure if their rent is high or the workers/owners are, but this is all insane to me.   This review might sound mean but some of the foundational things in my mind are missing.",

Taste I would give this place \"A.\" Maybe next time I will get the bigger size as I know I like the drink.

This one in-particular is my favorite, with a bright and airy lounge to enjoy one of their specialty brews and a cool and comfortable patio, they really know how coffee was meant to be enjoyed. Six rotating taps of local beers along with wine, I make sure to visit at least once a week to see what new wonderful drinks they're serving.  Rather than bombard you with displays of miscellaneous drinks and snacks from 3rd party companies, (energy drinks, soda, bottled water, etc.) Cartel focuses on the only thing a coffee shop should; great coffee.  However, the costumer service is not as consistent as some of the other shops I frequent. I worked as a barista in a shop not unlike Cartel for a few years, and I understand that it's very hard to be at your best a hundred percent of the time, but I feel the staff could be a bit more honest and kind to their customers,  Still, I enjoy Cartel immensely and I'll still be stopping by for a quality brew when I can. Don't miss a chance to check out this little shop for a nice coffee and a relaxed vibe.",

We stayed and played some chess, ended up being there until closing and Mikey simply came out to let us know we were welcome to stay as long as we liked, he merely had to lock the outside gate, which led to a hilarious conversation about old school tv shows including Legends of the Hidden Temple.

They have a strong selection of blonde roasts, but no dark roasts here, unfortunately. They also have a few local beers which are entertaining to try as well.  I like both the Tempe and Scottsdale locations, but I tend to frequent the Scottsdale shop slightly more often. It's pretty quiet, and serves as a nice location to do homework, read, or produce music.",

    "text": "It seems a lot of places are now offering Cartel Coffee and it's becoming more popular by the minute.   I really wanted to check out the hype and stopped by last Saturday around 10:30am. After reading a few reviews, I was under the assumption Cartel served some form of breakfast (sandwiches? Burritos?). When I asked the barista, he told me no and pointed to the display case of pastries. I was a little disappointed by this as I was starving.  Nothing in the pastry case really sparked my interest and I had two employees staring at me expectantly. Glancing up, I looked at the very simple menu and tried to gauge what I wanted. Feeling pressured, I ordered my standard go-to drink: a small vanilla latte. The latte was a tiny 8oz and $4 total. Needless to say, I was a little disappointed. (One of my favorite coffee shops has 8oz as their small size, but they list the pricing/sizing on the menu so I can make an appropriate decision.) Taking my drink to go, I slowly sipped my drink. It was a good, decent latte. Definitely better than any chains and a few other local shops I've been to, but not something I'd drive out of my way for.   A few weeks following my first experience, I decided to give Cartel another go. This time, I knew I wanted to try their iced coffee. I also ordered a large hot latte for a friend. After making the large latte, the barista poured my iced coffee and asked if I needed cream. I told him I definitely needed enough cream to make the drink a mellow khaki color. He then proceeded to take the left-over hot milk from the previous latte and pour it into my iced coffee. Two things. He asked if I wanted \"cream\" not milk. Second, he didn't give me an option to say no to hot milk being poured into my cold drink. Since I haven't been a barista for over 7 years, I decided to go with the flow and didn't say anything. He then handed me my drink and I proceed to add some simple syrup. (Next to the counter, there is a small area with sugar packets, lids, napkins, and simple syrup in a pump.) After adding some simple syrup, I took a tentative sip. I almost spit it out. The drink tasted like oranges. Strong, overpowering oranges. Oh god. I looked up at the barista, but he was already engaged with another customer. Not wanting a confrontation, I decided to take my paid-for drinks and go. I tried a few more sips of the drink, but just couldn't do it. It was horrible. I then drove down the street to another coffee shop (which coincidently served Cartel beans) and ordered a hot latte.   The hype sucked me in and I'm glad I gave it a try. However, I will probably never be back. There are so many other good local coffee shops near me that I would not go out of my way to drive to Cartel.",

Pick your coffee (they have a \"green\" buyer), add to the a roaster with over a decade of experience, baristas that know how to prepare your coffee (the final stage can make or break that cup of morning/afternoon madness) and you have yourself a \"great cup of joe\".  A few fun snacks; soft pretzels, crazy cookies (forget you are \"dieting\"), scones, etc. Funky music in the background, 4 large communal tables and side couch with small tables if you want some alone time all works together. Easy free wi-fi (hate to get a code, type in some mysterious 17 digit code that never seems to work until after 22 tries) and pretty fast, too!   It is not your dad's coffee place, so if you want a quiet, soft chair place to read your newspaper, this in not your place. Perhaps pick it up to go! This is a jolt of absolute heaven!

I usually drink 4-5 cups of coffee house coffee per day and found the $4.25 (5.25 after tip) expensive for drip coffee. It was served in a pint glass which was strange but OK with the sleeve.

Came back today for another one and they remembered me! It's kind of silly, but I was like, yes! That was me thank you! :) I always appreciate when they do that. Oh, just in case anyone was curious- I picked my hetero life mate up a regular one - w/milk (and he is a big ol' coffee snob) and he loved it!",

First I gotta say the girl with the bangs was super nice and really cool. My complaint here is that we were on the road and stopped in here to support local coffee shops and wanted a coffee and a quick bite. My buddy got his latte within 5 mins and he was happy. I just ordered a plain black coffee and I'm not exaggerating, I waited 25 mins to get it. I get that they're crafting me a nice cup of Joe and all but 25 mins is nuts. How do they do business in the morning rush?? And not to pile on,  but we ordered a hummus sandwich and a egg and ham sandwich and that took 30 mins to make! They weren't even packed, they were just moving that slow. Forgive me if I'm being too impatient but that is way too long to be waiting for a plain coffee and a sandwich.",

I like Starbucks, but the coffee here has a unique taste to it...even my 6 year old sister loved the coffee here! The ambience of the place is very chill. It's very much \"hipster\" and \"artsy\". There are abstract paintings everywhere, and unique pieces of furniture. When I went there, there were many people studying and going on their computers.   I ordered an Agave flavored Iced Latte which was the best! If you're a black coffee drinker like me, this place is amazing. The latte was flavored so it had a bit of sweetness in it, but not too much. Most of the ingredients are organic, so the coffee tasted very refreshing. I think the agave flavoring is what made the drink so unique. I have to go back to get it again, and maybe bring my laptop to relax there.",

The atmosphere was comfortable and I was able to catch up with a friend and relax there.   The second time, I stopped in to purchase some coffee beans as gifts for my out of town relatives, thinking it would be a nice unique and local present. After choosing the type of coffee, my friend and I stood by the counter waiting to be acknowledged by the barista, who was chatting with a friend.   We waited patiently for a greeting or an offer to ring up the coffee. The barista did not acknowledge us or even look our way even after his friend sat down. He started cleaning the bar instead. Finally he asked what he could do for us. I handed him the 3 bags of coffee and he rang me up. He swiped my card, flipped the iPad for me to sign and turned his back on me. I signed and grabbed my card he had tucked into the iPad stand, calling out a thank you. He did not respond and chose to ignore any semblance of a polite customer interaction.   Comparing my two experiences, I would say that your experience probably depends on when you stop in. There seem to be some really great reviews on this place.  Unfortunately for me, my bad experience outweighed my good one and it's just not worth it for me to return and spend my time and money there.   I'm sad that I spend 40 dollars on some coffee beans that I'm rather embarrassed to give to my family, lest they stop in at this location when they are in town next and have a terrible customer service experience that I did.",

Cartel offers the best, top-notch coffee roasted and brewed in the valley...but although the coffee is superb, the people behind the counter make this much more than a place to pick up a latte. The manager, Ben greets me as a best friend every time I come in, and the rest of the staff remembers my past orders, my questions on life, and they genuinely listen every day I walk through the front door.  The setting of Cartel is perfect for good conversations, the music playlist is everything you'd want, and the snacks from Phoenix Public Market are extremely hard to avoid eating (because they're delicious). If you need to get work done, head to the back room where it's quiet and ideal for knocking out a homework or work assignment.  In general, I cannot recommend this place more. Ben, Kiley, and Mark have become friends that I look forward to seeing each time I come in. I buy their beans, make cold brew at home from their instructions, and often come just to sit and hang out. If there was a six star review, I'd give it to them.  Bravo.",

    "text": "Finally, a coffee place you can brag about going to.  Cartel is an intelligent coffee shop with trendy decor and knowledgeable baristas. I feel good about being there, like I've chosen wisely for not going to a run-of-the-mill coffee-bucks type establishment. Though I sometimes feel out of my element because I don't know a lot about coffee, I've always been treated with courteous and attentive customer service.  By the way, major bonus points for using an iPad to place orders and being able to text or email you the receipt. Why don't more places do that?  The Espresso is strong with a solid kick and does the trick. I like how they serve it in a mug instead of a paper cup. The Chai Latte is also phenomenal. As good, if not better than ones I've had elsewhere.  I'm impressed by the various coffee beans and accessories they offer too. I even purchased the Aeropress so I can make coffee like them (and because of the great reviews: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAerobie-AeroPress-Coffee-Espresso-Maker%2Fdp%2FB0047BIWSK&s=11cd7c0712c799039bcd205e04bc2b4d17fa3b8514bbd58575f072465f657efa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">amazon.com/Aerobie-AeroP...</a>). *Be sure to buy it from the store, though*  Looking forward to trying out their food and BEER selections soon. But, even if they only served coffee, I'd be more than happy.  Definitely check out their Tempe location for a very hipster hole-in-the-wall ambiance that reminds me of drinking coffee in a place like Chicago or NYC: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/cartel-coffee-lab-tempe\">yelp.com/biz/cartel-coff...</a>",

    "text": "Cartel is a great Phoenix cup of coffee. I have to admit, when you're in NYC, SF, LA, in particular-- you're exposed to some of the best coffee in the world.  When you're in Phoenix, however; Cartel is a quite decent local roastery. My go-to drink is a Gibraltar. If you have a palate for smooth espresso and you're able to diffentiate quality from garbage.... you will appreciate this place :) Ambiance is great too at all locations. I'm not giving it 5 starts because their restrooms are horrendous. Regardless of gender, I prefer Male & Female restrooms to be separate. Men simply are not as clean as women when it comes to restroom cleanliness. I honestly think they would draw in more people and have even more repeat customers if they invested in revamping the restrooms at both the Tempe & Scottsdale locations.",

Leaving a great sub par coffee for domestic consumption. The flavor profile of the coffee cartel is so complex. Subtle undertones of honey or vanilla, orange effervescence( depending on what they have and what you choose). James is my go to hit here. Super cool, chill and knowledgable. He remembers your name too. Please drink it black, adding anything will ruin the brew in my opinion.  They have an amazing cold brew as well and fresh top notch pastries. Try the pop tart. If you're a local or a tourist stop by cartel, grab a pour over coffee, a pop tart and take 30 min to appreciate life how good it truly is. When you're recharged go try and spread the good vibes by helping another!",

    "text": "I was feeling a bit slumpy on a Sunday afternoon. And as a California native who recently moved out here, I'm definitely still acclimating to the bone-dry Arizona climate. The heat really taxes me, especially when I'm already in a mental fog.  Anywayzies, I was perusing the streets of downtown Scottsdale with a friend was visiting for the holiday weekend. We both needed a pick-me-up and a task to kill a bit of time, so we decided to hunt down a caffeinated solution. Starbucks is great, but there are a ton of great alternative coffee spots in Arizona. Luckily, my Yelp search results fed me Cartel and I'm pleased to announce that I have found a new go-to coffeehouse.   My order: an iced vanilla latte with 4 shots. Wow! There is definitely something extraordinarily invigorating about the coffee beans Cartel harnesses. With every sip, I gradually regained pep. The next thing I knew, I was bopping and singing along to a Spotify track in my friend's car.   That said, I don't recommend 4 shots if you're already kind of awake. I think next time I'll level down to 2 shots if I'm already primed from some sort of caffeine intake earlier that day.  I also have to say that atmosphere-wise, the charm and comfort level of this place is incredible. With plenty of space, as well as couches, chairs and tables spread out amongst 2 rooms, this abode is an ideal spot for hosting a wide variety of scenarios; from a dynamic conversation between friends, to a great first-time meeting spot for a Tindr rendezvous, to a study haven for a last-minute cramming session.",

The 'Lab' or cafe itself is very sweet and different, but the menus behind the counter were very basic and didn't specify any of their specialty drinks that I have seen other Yelpers order, so I had to ask a lot of questions.   The guys behind the counter weren't the friendliest - maybe their patience was running thin on all the questions I was asking! They weren't busy at all, so it would have been nice to have felt more welcome.  I was interested in looking at the merch and coffee products they were selling inside, however most of the shelves were nearly empty and nothing replenished, so I just took the coffees and headed straight out.  I ordered the vanilla latte and my partner, the cappuccino. Nice coffees, rich in flavour, but I wouldn't make a special trip for their product.  If in the area, give it a try. Although if you want to try anything other than a regular americano or latte, be prepared to ask questions!",

I was there to catch up with a friend but plenty of people were working, meeting with big groups, or just popping in to grab a quick coffee.   I was really excited about the build your own coffee with their three different brew methods - Chemex pour over 20oz, V60 drip in 12oz or 16oz, and AeroPress for 8 oz. On top of all these brew methods they had 6 different coffee beans to choose from. I had the Chemex of the Nyeri Hill coffee. They were busy so it took about 15 minutes for us to get it, and they served our coffee to us in a glass carafe that was way too hot to handle. Once I made my friend beat the burden of pouring the coffee, I wasn't blown away by the flavor. But I will say the description of \"intense blood orange and pomegranate\" is no lie. At other coffee shops I've had plenty of roasts claiming flavor where there really is only one if you use your imagination - Cartel was not at all like that.   In addition to this they had everything else you'd expect from a coffee shop, plus some beer taps, plus a wall of merch, plus a location that's perfect to grab a cup of coffee to go and stroll through shops.   Definitely worth checking out!",

I like the ambiance and layout of the coffee shop - good mellow music and decent seating. The coffee shop is clean and we were greeted upon entering. The employees were friendly and I appreciate that. The roast their coffee locally and have a lot of offerings including cold brew on tap. We were not offered for here mugs although everyone else in the shop had one. Kinda felt like because they didn't know us - they just gave us to go cups. The latte art was beautiful on mine with a big white heart. They don't offer sugar free flavors here and the although the milk was creamy - I needed to add some sugar to offset the espresso which I wasn't the biggest fan off. The shots were pulled right - it just wasn't the full bodied espresso I typically like. I am relatively neutral regarding this place on whether I'd come back or not.   Unroasted: nice decor but does not all make sense.   I like the seating but I always miss seeing a big comfy couch or loveseat.    I do like the poster on wall to add a pin of where you are coming from.    Love the look of the clean menu.   The staff was nice and greeted properly.  They did not ask if it was for here or to go.  I always prefer drinking out of mug.   They did a nice job with the latte it looked great but no sugar free options.    I was able to drink my coffee but not my favorite.    I really wanted to like this place but it fell short.  Ps added sugar",

When I first walked in, I noticed the ample seating and warm environment! There were high top tables with bar stools, multiple long tables, and cushioned seats along the wall. There is also an outdoor seating area with smaller tables and a couch! So lots of space to choose from! I saw multiple people on their laptops so looks like a great work environment or fun place to catch up with a friend. We ordered a chai tea latte and a one and one. The one on one came in 3 small cups with: 1. espresso 2. espresso with milk and 3. soda? The espresso was delicious, bold, and strong. The chai tea latte was also delicious but a tad too sweet for my liking. There are lots of coffee options to choose from so I will definitely be back!",

Maybe even Philz since this is one of the few places with azn kids in the desert.  Coffee-wise, pretty comparable and yummy. Almond milk latte, dirty chais are yummy. The crowd is mixed and interesting. Favorite chill spot in the area, although it makes me emo hearing a track every 15 minutes from a band that I can't see live here. At least we got Jamie XX.",

The decor, as with the other location, is a bit \"industrial.\"  That is, long wooden tables a la picnic tables provide most of the work space, and it feels like a hipster classroom at times with everyone on their MacBooks.  However, this is not necessarily a negative, especially given some of the options in this part of town.  Outside space is very nice.  But most importantly:  The coffee and teas are awesome, brewed to order, and the staff is wonderful.  The music is always great, but bring headphones in case the music doesn't match your current needs...it's hard to focus on \"work\" when the music and people watching are so awesome...

Iced will probably get you less of it since they pile up the ice. The tea was sweetened already, but the sweetness wasn't overpowering.   They don't have designated parking, but there is minimal store front parking. If you go early, you won't have a problem.",

I went in on a hot Sunday afternoon, thirsty for a cold refreshing beverage. There were many students hard at work on their laptop with their notebooks spread across the spacious tables. Fortunately there wasn't a line at the register. I was able to ordered my coffee immediately but didn't receive an order number nor did they take note of my name. I took a seat at a nearby table and patiently waited for my drink. After a few minutes of waiting, I glanced at the barista and saw her talking with a young women over the counter. A customer? Maybe a friend? I didn't think much of it.   By now, nearly 15 minutes had gone by and the barista finally finishes her all-important talk and hastily fills the machine with coffee beans to make my drink. In less than a minute, my drink was ready and she calls out \"iced latte.\" There was no eye contact, no acknowledgement, and no apologies about the wait as I approached to get my drink. I'm by no means entitled or picky when it comes to service. I waited patiently for my drink because who knows what the context of the situation is. But my experience here left me disappointed. The care and attention I received here was nonexistent.",

They had a variety of options including teas. I settled for the basic coffee americano. It was just as good as it smelled the barista was very patient considering we didn't know what we really wanted.  She also offered suggestions which helped us. They had inside and a sort of outside seating arrangement. It could get a little to hot for outside sitting so we sat inside but within a few minutes the place started getting packed. They also had specialty items for sale. This place seems to be a very hip place to go for surrounding neighborhood. Looking forward to coming back and visiting.",

It's a small shop that shares seating and restrooms with the other shops next to it so it feels bigger than it is.    The baristas were friendly and made a killer iced vanilla latte for my husband and a cold brew with a splash of cream for me.  We also picked up a couple of bags of beans, which we just finished up tonight.  The decaf is what we have at night and quite good.  Their roasts are smooth, not bitter and delicious.",

Rolled my eyes and paid for it because I really needed the late afternoon pick me up.   Wanted to patronize a local shop over a Starbucks, but honestly it backfires at this Cartel Coffee location. Rude, rude, rude.   I initially ordered an agave latte (first time) and asked about the sweetness level. The barista was pretty aloof and uppity and he wasn't much help in determining if this latte would be very good. So I asked for them to go very light on the agave.   Turns out no one was listening and I received an overly sickening sweet latte with a bad pull of espresso.   This is the second location we have been to with zero luck on the coffee and especially the horrible service. Just another uncaring, dirty little hipster coffee spot that really can't be bothered to serve the community at even a basic level of customer service.   It's in a really cute shopping area, but I highly encourage you to skip this place. Won't be back, and will be sure to let my coworkers and local friends know about the crappy experience here. Lame.",

You know what I mean, it's early on a weekend morning, you're wandering around Old Town, doing a little window shopping before the stores open, pretending you're on a \"walk\", and suddenly this cute, local, hip, coffee shop appears before you.   Cartel has lots of drink options - coffees (obviously), teas and even beer, along with a good selection of pastries. It has a modern/industrial feel, with both indoor and outdoor seating. It's the kind of place you would read a newspaper on a Sunday morning, if anyone actually did that any more. More likely, it's a place to kick back, enjoy your drink and scroll through Instagram posts on your phone, wishing your life was so nicely curated.   I had an iced vanilla latte with oat milk, which I'd never tried before. The barista said oat milk was her favorite, so I took her word for it. I liked it! We also had an iced tea and the salted brownie cookie. The cookies were a free treat for moms on Mother's Day, which was really sweet (get it? sweet? Is this thing on?)  I've read some of the other reviews and I didn't find the coffee to be overly bitter, but I do like a strong roast (I like Starbucks, so sue me). I would definitely go back on a weekend morning to have a caffeinated beverage and hang out!",

Something about the smell and ambiance that hits you when you first walk in is a little but magical.   Cafe Ambiance: -They always play the COOLEST music and it's just loud enough to drown out conversations around you so you can actually be productive if that's the purpose of your visit -lots of seating and work space with outlets all around and just enough natural light -the smell of coffee roasting is truly intoxicating and it's one of my favorite things about Cartel  Drinks and pastries: -I ordered my usual dirty chai, but this time with Oat milk! I love the oat milk in the chai, I think it's much smoother than almond milk, but my mom ordered a regular latte with oat milk and was not a fan, so I would say to proceed with caution with this option. Maybe stick to soy or almond which are their other dairy alternatives if you aren't sure about oat milk -we tried the golden milk snickerdoodle today and it was AMAZING! It has a spicy flavor profile with a sweet and slightly tart (lemony?) glaze drizzle on top which complimented the spicy flavor very well  Overall, I love Cartel and I will obviously be back for more of their dirty chai!",

Treats: I've only had their coffee cake (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>) but their muffins and caramel bars look legit! Treats range from $2-3, can't go wrong if your sweet tooth is kicking in.   Overall experience: Love this place for a quick stop for coffee to go, or sitting down for a couple hours to do some work. You'll always find people working on their computers or just hanging out. Never too loud, and it's in the heart of Old Town. Great location, and great shopping next door!   Happy Hour Thursday's! 4pm-close $2 off all beer & wine $3 cans of beer (All featuring local breweries & wineries!)",

The coffee was well balanced and had just the amount of body so I could enjoyably sip the entire 16 ounce pot without it cooling too fast.  The vibe is super chill. Quiet enough to crank out some tasks if you're working from home. Loud enough to enjoy a conversation with a friend without offending your closest neighbor.  Thank you Cartel",

    "text": "I can't say that I'm impressed by this coffee shop's attitude nor their roasting ability. Back when they first opened in Tempe it was a totally different experience. I used to get Cartel Coffee whole beans regularly, but then I moved away for a period of time. I thought I'd give them a try again as they used to roast pretty good coffee. Well times have changed and they seem to be under the impression that under roasting coffee is a good thing. I purchased 2 12oz bags of beans at $19 for 12oz thinking it was a full 16oz. I guess 12oz is because they are \"ultra premium\". I took the coffee home and made espresso. The beans gave off a good aroma as it brewed, but the flavor was terrible. Overly sour and acidic in a bad way. The beans were under roasted and also had an inconsistent roast. some beans were almost a light tan color while others were a deeper tan, but none were a full roast. I contacted the shop thru yelp prior to making this review and the owner responded with a diatribe on how I just didn't understand how coffee is made and they'd be happy to educate me the next time I was in. I was told that things I disliked were actually positives. Over all I was treated like I was stupid for even suggesting there was something wrong with their coffee. Not a positive experience and I won't go back. I'd recommend Coffee Rush for a much better customer experience.",

It is just like how I'd imagine a coffee shop, with the vibe, kind of akward build, and character that so many coffee shops lack these days (ahem cough cough Starbuckscough!). It felt strange to be in because I am so use to the \"other guys\" set-up that I've been going to for years, but I liked it...it left me wanting other experiences there. The latte I had was pretty good, hand made with care and time invested, instead of just thrown together quickly by a barista in a green apron. The 2 guys behind the counter were nice, one welcoming me back for a future visit. I thought it was cool they have a side-bar where they serve a couple different micro-brews and wine, something at least I've never seen in a coffee shop. Just an interesting place all together. I wish I could've spent some more time there but I enjoyed my brief visit. As of now, they have a new customer! The coffee, unique experience, and service equals a 4.5, obviously have to down grade to a 4. Oh and a side note...their cash register is an ipad, which is something you don't see everyday.",

My only real complaints with this place are:   They have items for sale all around the same place where you get lids, sugar, etc.. which is annoying if you're trying to get out of there only to try to navigate around someone looking at tea blends.    It's unclear to people who aren't regulars where to order and where to pick up, this causes unnecessary crowding in the wrong spots and general confusion.  The last time I was in there a guy was waiting at the pickup area so I walked up to place my order, he then called me out stating he actually had been there first but no one told him where to order.  I would have hoped the staff would have said something (like my bad, we should have acknowledged you) but they didn't - I allowed him to order before me but I was mortified nonetheless.

The coffee and tea are good enough, but the wifi and service have failed to impress. I've come here a couple times to get work done before a dinner plan in old town, and I've had to just quit and sit because I can't keep a steady internet connection. The staff are knowledgeable, but my interactions have consisted of lacking eye contact and as few words as possible. Lastly, the price is not competitive with similar offerings elsewhere- but as this is the only coffee shop in old town, I guess they can do what they want.",

The crew formerly of Solas Coffee really provides top notch service. Snap up a chocolate chip and bacon cookie or a slice of the coffee cake that rocks. Cappuccinos and Macchiattos are for drinking in and have well crafted foam. If your looking for a super sweet 1100 calorie Fat-a-chino.. keep driving to Starbucks and sip on some burnt bean lates. Know, if you want a smooth well crafted cup drip coffee made for you or rich espresso, come see the crew at Cartel Scottsdale. They also have the OG Tempe, new downtown with kitchen and Tucson location (former ally Avenue Coffee).",

Support your local business and PAHLEASE stop drinking corporate crap. 2- They take their coffee seriously. Have you seen the way they cold drip coffee? or how they delicately stir lattes? Yeah, get to it. 3- The vibe. LOVE the artsy interior and the fact they promote local artists by displaying their work through out the shop. 4- They have two central locations for your coffee addiction convenience. One in Tempe on University and Ash. The other on 5th avenue in Scottsdale.  5- They both offer delicious pastries and the Scottsdale location has breakfast and lunch options and just recently expanded their counter space to offer scrumptious beers.  It certainly doesn't hurt that the staff knows their stuff about coffee and that their service is courteous and real. If you don't enjoy your espresso here, you're only hurting yourself.  I love you Cartel!",

These guys won't ice your espresso because it gets bitter, and won't put your espresso in a paper cup to go. It's unlikely you can order a caramel macchiato or the other weird sugar bombs people seem to like from Starbucks or Coffee Bean Tea Leaf. But you know what?The drink that comes over that counter is REALLY GOOD.   Also, great selection of beer! Glad to know I can go somewhere on the weekend to have a latte then a beer while I work -- or maybe a couple beers, until I no longer feel like working. Plenty of space to work, excellent interior design (I believe the owner makes the really functional and comfortable industrial-modern furniture) and luckily, the crowd in the Scottsdale location turns over pretty quick, no one is sitting around for hours or needing to get kicked out by the baristas.   It's a little unclear what food they serve, there's always a couple things in the case next to the counter, have never tried any of it. Too busy trying to figure out if I want another cup of coffee or a beer.",

Whether or not you're down with the whole vibe, there's one thing in common....good coffee. These guys do not know how to make good coffee.

He told me \"he'd put it on the side'. Please...this ain't Mastros Steakhouse and I'm not asking you to put A1 steak sauce on a filet mignon.

Each tailors specifically to the demographic at hand, which I can totally get behind.  The fact that each shop has its own deal going on is awesome - I really dislike chains and the chain feel/look.  I hadn't seen Jason in a while at the other shops, the times I'd frequented, and was happy to see him behind the bar when I came here for the first time.  Just the same way the other Cartel shops have a selection of brewing methods, this one does as well.  Pour-over, aeropress, Chemex and traditional espresso (La Marz GS/3).  As expected from him, our drinks were flawless.  He transfers this knowledge and passion to the baristas, which is obvious even when one leaves his establishment to go somewhere else - they stand out in the crowd of many coffee-pullers.  The beans, who can complain?  Jason made his name with the roasting.  I got a prepared sandwich here, and my was it tasty.  Bread was fresh.  Sauce, ingredients and overall creation was good.  Big Ben: you stole my tastebuds' heart that morning.  Casual lounge area (see: couches), outdoor covered seating (see: hallway - shaded and cool!) and plenty of seating inside.  As normal, his handiwork shines throughout the shop.  Somehow I've never reviewed a Cartel shop before, despite my years of patronage.  My latest experience changes that.",

The peanut butter version with peanut butter icing was below average, the cranberry/white chocolate variety was equally bad and the winner was the one that looked like an Oreo. Iced Mocha features get your own lid at this location, but not the best version in town.",

Friendly staff and decent prices.  Nice local atmosphere.  Agree with Roxy H. that it has that feel of the Aussie local coffee shops. For stay-in coffee they have mugs with a refill pricing that is nice.",

Nothing could bring this coffee back to life.   I am into coffee...big time. I have been drinking coffee from all over the USA since the 1970s. It has to be bold and fresh. I've been here a few times. I like the atmosphere, though it's mostly students hanging out. Still, it's pretty funky, and I wanted to love it here. the servers were nice enough. It's just that the coffee was TERRIBLE. Please, whoever owns this place, train your staff to make consistent coffee that is bold. From the three times I've been here, in different months, all three cups of your boldest coffee tasted WEAK! I don't know how to express this more. I will check you guys out again and see if there is improvement, but quite frankly, I don't see that happening. This is sad to me, because I want to love it here.",

Friendly baristas, efficient service. Didn't see a whole lot of munchies for sale but looks like the friendly folks make scones, muffins, cookies and sandwiches too. They also sell their very own coffee! Coool!! Yippy!  I just had a large latte and it was served in a large tall glass and I thought it was pretty tasty...maybe a little more expensive than the average latte, but it was good so no complaints. I love that area of town and wish them much success.  Yep, I'm a fan because I love independent coffee houses and the folks usually work very hard to make delicious beverages and do everything they can to make the customer happy.",

They're so tight!  +How long did it take to get that many tattoos?  +What kind of hair spray do hipster chicks use? +How do you decide to become a hipster? Is there a school? Or a manual at least?  I wonder if they look at me with amazement as well? Probably not, mostly because I'm not a hipster and quite ordinary when compared to a hipster.   Visiting the beautiful wood and metal adorned Cartel Coffee Lab is like watching hipsters in the wild...   (Insert British voice over and African safari noises)   Watch the hipster making coffee in their natural habitat. They are pleasant, but not overtly friendly. You look them up and down. They don't really care what you are wearing. You are fascinated... they just want to know what you want to drink? You cannot decide... the hipster is not openly bothered but most likely is annoyed by your inability to make a decision because you get nervous when hipsters stare at you. You make your decision and the hipster asks you what size. Shit, another decision must be made! Their coffee cups are small as this is not an anti-hipster corporate hangout, aka Starbucks. Wow, you think! Hipsters are so cool they don't even need a super sized venti coffee to feel important. Do you secretly want to become a hipster? No. You have no tattoos and are pretty sure that's the first requirement for being a True hipster. They do a good job with their coffee though so you shall continue to be fascinated by hipster culture from afar.   \"Hipster\" (as defined by Urban Dictionary:  Definitions are too mainstream. Hipster's can't be defined because then they'd fit in a category, and thus be too mainstream.  Shut the front door!  31 Yelps Challenge: #26/31",

We raced over to Old Town so we could get in the door in time, and I was pleased to see that the lone barista didn't appear disgruntled by our intrusion.  We did make it pretty easy, ordering mostly the same drink (Hot Chai Latte) and paying on one tab.  He went out of his way to help my non-coffee-drinking friend choose a tea and I overheard him joking around as he steamed some milk.  He was friendly and knowledgeable; that's what I want in a barista!  The Chai Lattes are phenomenal.  I don't know what they do differently than any other coffee shop, but they turn out great.    I like that after weaving through throngs of \"Scottsdale people\" (you know who I mean) I can walk in to this coffee shop and feel like I'm not in Scottsdale.  It's industrial, small, with cool decor.  I love the iPad that's used for placing orders, charging credit cards, and providing receipts.  It's sleek, eco friendly, and hip.  I hope that's the way of the future!  I also love that this isn't Starbucks.",

Places like Sip use Cartel Coffee but for whatever reason I like it best at Cartel. If you want the best coffee in town go to Cartel. However,  Cartel lacks friendly staff.  I am a very easy going person, not a lot of things bother me, and really the employees do not bother me all that much, but enough to write this review. I have had this conversation with many different people, and we have all agreed - the Scottsdale Cartel employees are aloof and dismissive. I am not sure if this comes from management? I know Abercrombie used to tell its employees to act aloof, so to add to its brand culture. I know that Cartel offers a premium product in terms of coffee, so it does appeal to a certain crowd. There is nothing wrong with that at all, that is why we have brands like BMW, and Prada - people like nice things.   People also like to be treated nice. I have been to a lot of coffee shops in my life, and the ones that stand out in my mind aren't always the ones with exceptional coffee (that certainly helps), but the ones that have an open, comfortable, home-like vibe. Cartel is not like that - I think it starts with the employees. I have on more than one occasion said \"how are you?\" or \"have a nice day\" only to be ignored. It is the weirdest thing.   I write this review not to criticize, but to critique. I feel somewhat alienated when I go into Cartel, it is a shame because it is close to where I live and work, and I really like the coffee, but out of principal I often avoid it.",

The natural lighting is just wonderful, and there's a lot of extra seating in the covered area between Cartel and the building next to it. As of all Cartel locations, love the coffee and I absolutely love that they use Maya Tea! If you're a fan of chai and haven't tried it yet, it is life changing!! Best chai I've ever had, hands down.

When we walked in, the smell exactly what you'd hope if you love the smell of coffee. It smelt like ~Heaven~ and by heaven I mean roasted coffee beans. People were chatting, working or simply enjoying their beverage of choice (there's even beer and wine on tap!)--it was a very welcoming and relaxing vibe.  Ok so what did I order? My girlfriend said they make a great chai so I took her word for it but took it a step further...I ordered me a *dirty*chai (chai with a shot of espresso). and It was Perfect. If you love chai you know how important it is for it to not be too sweet and this had the perfect combo of spice, hint of espresso and creaminess!  It's sad to admit how much I loved Cartel Coffee Lab's brew and have to accept that it's out of the way to get on a regular basis but when I'm in the neighborhood I will definitely be stopping in to get my fix!  *cheers*",

I also tried the cold brew & aero pressed coffee (with Maravilla coffee from Guatemala). Both were very good. The shop's unique because there's a side outdoor area with seats and lounge furniture & also a backroom where people predominantly study. I like the segregation of the dining spaces because it allows for people who want to talk be separated from people who want to read/study. A bag of beans here costs around $19. They serve pour over and chemex coffee as well. They also seem to serve some alcohol.",

It is also 10 degrees cooler (down to mid 90s) this morning, so I am definitely having a HOT latte.   The good news? No problem finding parking and no waiting in line to order either.   Smooth espresso in my latte, but I certainly did not need a 16 ounce (served in a gigantic glass). A 12 ounce in a cup would have been sufficient for my needs.

I always get the lattes here (iced or hot) and found them to be pulled well. Though I did have a hot latte once served in a beer glass and that was not so nice ... for my unassuming hand. Hot coffee and glass = bad idea. However, I got over that with a little sleeve and having my coffee cooled down a bit. Good coffee here and love the buzz even from their latte.  The interior is very industrial with tons of metal, wood and raw looking. I found the sound to be quite minimal even with such a small space encasing a few number of people. There's seating out front, on their covered porch area (which can be quite warm) and have a quieter back room near the bathrooms that's separated by a door. Music is played at a low volume which isn't too distracting, but enough to break the silence.  Great place to have a chat over good coffee or to work on your computer.",

Staff is awesome, the hiring manager has an eye for talent. They are all uber cool in the Seattle stylish way.

The website offers great advice on how to make a proper cup of coffee at home. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cartelcoffeelab.com&s=4544edd75be61ca54ef1efd0fc31f29c7e7dbbcb0028fec1ace64d50abde1d65\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">cartelcoffeelab.com</a>",

I swear on my dogs life it's worth a nearly 16 hour flight for Coffee in Melbourne. There is no replicating it, I came home seriously ruined. I came home seriously worried that no coffee joint would compare, and let's be honest I don't add sugar, maybe a little warm milk and I love my flat whites! So sorry Starbucks, my coffee bean farewell because Cartel Coffee has become my official go to joint! My flat white was smooth and creamy, it l didn't need an ounce of sweetener. It was so good I came back for seconds!  So Cartel coffee lives up to the hype - no joke",

I only got the classic drip coffee when I came because I realized, a little too late, about all of their coffee selection. They have different roasts and beans and can make it in the aeropress or three other types of pour-overs, including the chemex.   Cartel knows their coffee. Their service was great too.",

This place used to be an independanct owned coffee house owned by a church I think, and even though now it is a chain it has maintained that amazing independant feel.   The staff are supa nice, make anything you want, and judge you hardcore if you put milk or sweetener in your joe. I'm also a big fan of using Square App to process credit cards because they email you a receipt instead of waste paper. I've only ever been for coffee on Sunday mornings to study, work, and read. However they do have a lunch snack option and serve wine and craft beer.   Can't beat Cartel for coffee anywhere in Scottsdale.   Each table has is supa orignal, handcrafted. The patio is completely shaded and not bad even on a hot summa morning. Bring a friend and play some of their chess or checkers games or sit and enjoy free wifi: password espresso",

You are hilarious! If only you actually understood coffee, you might have been able to actually promote better coffee in AZ! You shouldn't be commenting about coffee since you drink it with caramel anyway. You should probably rethink that life decision! As for your bad customer service experience, i deeply apologize for that! They no longer work for us. I would be happy to send you a bag of our coffee in the mail, so you dont have to come in. You just have to promise me you will taste before you add! Email me - jason@cartelcoffeelab (BTW - could you please clean up the profanity?)\"",

    "text": "I am a huge fan of local coffee shops with free wifi. I am also a huge fan of iced lattes. I know, how trendy of me, don't judge, I have some weird phobia about drinking hot lattes...I can't explain it...getting off track...anyway! Cartel!  I really like getting my work done here. This is a short walk away from J's place so whenever I'm in town and need to get work done, I head here. I like the decor, I like the music they play (I don't even need to tune out with my headphones and spotify like I normally do when at coffee shops), and the coffee is pretty good. The ambience is chill and very oddly conducive to me getting things done. The staff here is really nice and friendly too.  Note: They also always have tempting pastries that one day I am sure I will break down and try. I'm nearly positive they'll be delicious.  Like the 4 stars say...  Yay! I'm a fan!",

    "text": "Almost everything about this place is perfect. .location staff service...but the music. ..every now and then they'll blast that crazy loud punk rock music which is fine in the right setting but I see nearby business people come here and students studying for exams and by the look on their faces they are annoyed with the loud music. This includes me. ...I wish they would tone it down with their selection of music to something more neutral and tolerable for most people",

    "text": "I went there once and was disappointed.  First of all, I paid $6.50 for 16 ounces of exotic coffee.  Secondly, the decor and atmosphere was weird.  I felt like I was in a 3rd world communal; except this one was created by students who've only read about the such places. If you bring your laptop expect to sit either next to or directly in front of a complete stranger.  (A great opportunity if you want to be social, not so if you want to concentrate.) A bonus was the access to the internet, the downside was trying to maneuver over sets of extension cords laying all over the ground.",

Cartel is a great place to hang out or study- music is chill and not too loud. Not to mention the chai is amazing. Seriously, like nothing I've had before. Definitely try it out!",

The i pad and app to pay up is very in genius and gives me a smile. As I am waiting for my drink I began to speak to the landlord in charge of beer. I'm told a few exciting things about the new, one day old beer garden and sample two favorites of mine.   I sat at a long table next to a chess set. Sure would be fun to play a game right now. I'm facing the street and kinda relaxing from walking. I think I just made about a two or three mile walk. My coffee is hella good. What a great day today was. People walking by the cartel are happy and looking good.   Boy you know the Lab will be hopped up tonight.",

The only problem is the wifi. It didn't work for me on neither my laptop, nor my smart phone.  I even tried a tablet but didn't work neither.  I asked the guys working there, someone told me he would check on that but never got back to me neither did the Internet work.   I would've given this place 5 stars of the Internet worked.",
