We then needed up waiting less than 5 minutes. We were sat and the waitress could not have been more unhappy.   She was complaining when we asked her for mugs for our coffee because we thought we were waiting 20 minutes so we all had to go cups from their cafe. She dropped the money on the floor without noticing and when we brought it to her attention she didn't even say a word or even look at us for that matter. She never came for refills such an ugly experience at such a nice restaurant!   The food was good but nothing out of the ordinary! I ordered a wrap which was tasty but the turkey was just piled in there so it was a little much but the food wasn't anything to complain about!",

We go to the Breakfast Club regularly and know the established staff very well.  It seems that now the staff (that has been there for a long time) are there very infrequently and there is a constantly revolving staff.  We are seeing the regulars stop coming and the (always) new staff don't seem to care as much.   The food is still wonderful, prices are reasonable; but the owner and manager need to take a closer look at how the wait staff is scheduled.  Please understand that your long-time servers care about their customers!   You need to care about them as well!!  No one can make a living working a couple of days a week.",

    "text": "My husband and I spend most weekend mornings in Scottsdale having breakfast. We have our usual spots, but felt like trying something new. We passed our tried and True spot and saw a bunch of open tables on the patio, but had already committed to doing something new so we kept driving and put in our name at Breakfast Club which had a 30-35 minute wait at 1130.   After waiting for 40 minutes we were seated at a table that was way too high for the chairs on the patio. I'm 5'10 and my husband is 6'5 so I don't even know how normal sized people eat comfortably at those tables as my back was killing me then and is still sore at the end of the day.  The food tasted great and came out quick, but the menu was so boring! My rule when I eat at a restaurant is that I never order something that I could make myself in an hour or less. I broke my rule today. Like I stated, the food was great don't get me wrong, but its kind of hard to mess up an omelette or BLT.   I won't be going back any time soon, but I wouldn't refuse to go if a friend wanted to which is why I give it a 3 star rating. Its not terrible, but it is also not something that I truly enjoyed given the long wait, uncomfortable seating, and the lack of exciting menu options.  I'll be fair and tell you what I did like about it though. What their food lacks their juice bar makes up for, they've got just about any juice you might want with breakfast. Also the food comes out really quick and is very well priced.",

Order of chocolate chip French toast, chocolate chip pancakes, waffle and breakfast burrito with Pork verde. Short wait for food, kids happy at arrival. Burrito was large and not overly spicy. Potatoes were pretty good with precooked peppers on the soggy side and not crisp. The burrito was average taste and nothing extraordinary. Kids enjoyed their meals, decent price point for quality.

There were 4 people standing at the check in counter (not sure why they needed so many people up there since they were not doing anything but playing on their cell phones and chatting with each other).  When she did arrive and we had put in our reservation, we were told we would still have to wait.  Again, there was table available and I had been there for 15 minutes.  Other people came in and got seated immediately without waiting.  We ended up at the counter and was told they did not have any soda except bottled regular coke.  I ended up with water (I don't drink coffee and there were no other decent options).  The server took her time getting to us and I had to ask twice for water.    The food portion came out a little too quickly (about 2 minutes). This made me wonder if it was pre-made rather than fresh.  The order had to be cooked and there was no way it could have been fresh.  It was not very hot which also made me question whether or not it was pre-made.  Overall, I have had much better service and food.  Considering we were at the counter, it took forever to get the bill and the never received any refills on the water.  I would not go back again.  Very dissappointed.",

If you experience high wait times, just walk around the neighborhood!  There is a nice bakery nearby, as well as a little coffee shop.  While I'm not a fan of their biscuits and gravy, the pancakes keep bringing me back.  Their pancakes are infused with a lot of flavors and the portions will fill you up fast.  Prices are somewhat affordable, but a family of 4-5 can easily rack up a $60 bill.  Don't hesitate to visit.  This is one of the best breakfast joints in Phoenix.",

The flavors from the jalapeno cheddar biscuit with gravy were incredible. My wife said the French toast was excellent but that the side of bacon she ordered was the best she's ever had. Her exact words were: \"I would've traded the 3rd piece of my French toast for another piece of bacon.\" Highly recommend grabbing breakfast here if you're in the area.",

Apparently in the summer months no one is busy in Scottsdale so we came in about 9:30am and were quickly seated by a cheerful server. I ordered the grilled cheese breakfast sandwich which was absolutely amazing. No complaints at all! I ordered the mimosa which tasted like only oj, meh. I ordered a side of fresh fruit and it was delicious and ripe slices of watermelon, honey dew, cantaloupe and pineapple, mmmm! I had a great experience here, I hope you do too!",

FOOD: Decent, nothing out of the ordinary. Good breakfast, fresh, nothing fancy or authentic. Deserves 3.5 stars.  STAFF: mixed feelings. Waiters were all nice and fast. But I truly hope management is reading this about the greeting staff: the girls at checkin are rude and very inconsistent. Day 1: First of all they told us 20 minutes, we said that's too long for us, so she said \"ok first available I could seat you know\"....ok what did she think we want? 2nd or 3rd available? Day2: 20 minute wait (first available lol), we waited 40, complained and got a very rude reply, a very dishonest apology, no smile, telling us about their policies.  Day3: 30 minute wait, ok, we wait 45, ask what's going on, again rude reply, no apology. She said 15 more minutes, 1 minute later we got seated.   I do get its hard to manage the flow in a restaurant accurate. A bit more friendliness would go a very very long way.  I'd rate this place a bit higher, not much wrong with it, but who wants to start his morning like this? Fails the purpose. A smile and a sincere apology would've been nice.",

The food is good, and there are lots of options (even super healthy options, which I was impressed with! The Health Conscious breakfast was delish!) The reason it gets 3 stars has to do with the service: We were seated at the bar, which was totally fine, except that upon ordering Mimosas we asked for grapefruit juice instead of orange juice and were told \"no\".  Kind of odd, but whatever, we ordered regular mimosas instead and were \"automatically\" given the large size (ie: also automatically charged for the large size).  When we asked the waitress about this, as we had wanted the regular size, she said that when you sit at the bar you are automatically given the large size unless you tell them otherwise.  Also kind of odd.  Overall, good food and not too bad of prices for Old Town, but I wasn't terribly impressed and certainly wouldn't want to wait over 45 minutes for it.",

A member of a party can not join mid meal. People will be ignored and feel disowned if the  party is incomplete ( you will not be seated, and will feel punished for it).  I feel nepotism is being used here; we were not spoken to once seated. I'm entitled to a nice welcome but was embarrassed by the lack of communication.  The manager reminded us that we needed to finish up and start leaving, so he can seat more people; fuck you! I want to eat comfortably, I didn't order no food to go. If you wanted things to be like this you should throw the food in a blender and turn the whole place into a quick drive through.!

Wish that the waitress's mentioned that the pancakes are each the size of a normal dinner plate because you have the option to order one pancake as opposed to a full order which is three. They were good though, however the berries are just thrown on top of the pancake and not mixed into the batter. Iced tea wasn't good, had an orange slice in it and tasted old. Atmosphere is very loud hard to hear the people you are with.  Service could have been better. Waitress seemed like she didn't have time to take our order or provide proper customer service, it wasn't overly busy so unsure why that was. I would consider going here again, as the food wasn't bad but probably wouldn't do this for an outing with family or friends as you can't really have good conversation here l.",

    "text": "Seeing that my last Breakfast Club review was in February 2009, it's definitely time for an update... since then, I've dined at this restaurant (both for breakfast and lunch) quite a few times.  I have one friend that eats here several times a week and swears by it.  They recently did a renovation and have a ton more space, hence less wait time on busy mornings.  It looks awesome - they have a great counter space, juice bar, brick wall, comfy booths and tables, and bigger bathrooms too.  You still get the same variety and quality of menu items since the renovation, but I'm pretty sure their prices went up a bit.  I find almost everything to be moderately priced, but I ordered a large grapefruit juice today without looking at prices and my friend told me that they charged $7 for it.  $7 for a large juice?  Are you kidding?  That's a bit much... even if it was freshly squeezed!  A few of my faves on the menu: the fresh start conscious, the oatmeal, the turkey wrap sandwich, and the berry/goat cheese salad.  Servings are large, service is always pretty attentive, and they are fine with substitutions... another perk for me is the location; it's super close to both my home and office making it extremely convenient for breakfast (and lunch) meetings.  Just watch out for the juice prices if you go!",

This place is busy, be prepared to wait 30 minutes if you want breakfast on the weekend. And when it's busy, be prepared to not find your waiter/waitress. They'll be running around and then you'll have to waive them down without making yourself look like a pretentious beezy. REFILL MY WATER.  I had the Wild Mushroom omlette which was made with something called fontina cheese. I love mushrooms and when I got my omelette there were plenty of mushrooms in this entree to make me happy. Simple omlette with plenty of mushrooms but not a whole lot of taste - I really was expecting more. I think this place may be a tad overpriced, but the portions are pretty large - so that may be the reason.   The girlfriend had Huevos Rancheros because she was in the mood for green chile and she said she loved it. It hit her spot like I never have and she was pleasantly full afterwards. However, I have recently found out that they serve pork green chile and that detail was not specifically on the menu when she ordered - so if you don't eat pork or have any dietary restrictions just be made aware of that.   I didn't leave this place saying, \"omg, i have to come back\" or even saying, \"their food was really good.\" It was an average food experience in a Scottsdale breakfast joint.",

The wait was pretty decent for a Sunday morning in the middle of old town Scottsdale. The host was friendly and helpful and seated us at a communal table with plenty of room between us and the other couple that was seated there.  I started off with a cup of coffee and my girlfriend went with a glass of fresh pineapple juice. Our drinks came quickly. The coffee was pretty great at this place. Hit the spot nicely. My girlfriend's pineapple juice was perfectly chilled and crisp.   She came back to take our order. I went with the Mignon Benedict and my girlfriend went with the roasted turkey benedict. The food arrived pretty quickly, and my glass of coffee was refilled a few times in the meantime. Atmosphere was nice and relaxing, despite the expected ridiculousness of some of the people that hang out in Old Town.   My food was fantastic. The steak was still red in the center. At $13 for the sandwich, I wasn't expecting the quality of steak I got. My girlfriend's dish was actually even better than mine. Our waitress was fantastic. Definitely hitting this spot again.",

Since they do not take reservations, we give our name to the hostess and knowingly are told the wait time to be ~45 min which we tack on another 30 on top of that. So we then get our nails done next door or walk over to the boutique across the street.  I have to say the line for a latte can be a bit of  a wait as well, but so worth it. Their coffee is truly yummy. I've eaten breakfast here.... their omelettes, breakfast burrito or taco are always good, but my most recent visit I was not in the mood for breakfast.  I had the tuna sandwich which was exactly what I was craving for... absolutely delicious without too much mayonaise. I hate when other places makes a tuna salad sandwich taste like there's no tuna but  gobs of more mayo oozing out.. gross!  Anyway their tuna here is perfect.

    "text": "Came here while on vacation, based on the reviews. Overall the food was great, but we developed a few words of wisdom on what to order -   The whole wheat pancakes and the challah french toast were incredible. The pancakes nearly floated off the plate, and the challah and candied nuts on the french toast made it taste like the perfect middle ground between brunch and desert.   I didn't eat the omelet with salmon or the honeydew (omelets come with fruit) but was told they were great too.   The only downside were the wild mushroom omelets and the potatoes it came with - they lacked seasoning. If they had any, we would be giving the restaurant 5 stars. The salmon omelet came with the same potatoes, but she opted for the hashbrowns which were awesome (I wish I had such foresight...)!",

The potatoes were good but covered in bell peppers, I \"picked through\" as I'm allergic to bell peppers (wish the menu had warned me-or if it was there, that I had seen it). If my food had been 'hot' I would have given 4 stars in spite of the long time in arriving. I would echo some of the other reviewers when they say the place seems a little short staffed.",

Extremely loud and energetic but not if you are looking for a more intimate relaxing breakfast.  First, the positive aspects of our visit was the service at our table.  The waitress attentive and friendly and provided quick service.    Our fresh squeezed juice was excellent, my 7 year old, who is an expert on pancakes, said that they were too gummy and did not taste good.  They remained uneaten on her plate.  My 12 year old's omelet was runny and had to be sent back to the kitchen for further cooking.   The counter service where we ordered smoothies before being seated at our table was the worst I have seen in years.  The girl handling the walk up/carry out counter continually took phone orders and ignored the line waiting patiently.  When I pointed this out I was shushed and received a \"talk to the hand\".  Extremely rude.  This girl should not be in the customer service industry and has lot to learn.  Not sure why she is in this role when she obviously does not enjoy what she is doing.   We will not be back.  Plenty of other excellent breakfast places in the Phoenix area with friendly staff.",

Breakfast was very straightforward, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  I chose a short stack of whole wheat pancakes and a side of hashbrowns, while my date chose the cinnamon challah french toast.  My order was perfection simply because of the portion size...the pancakes were much smaller than those in the full order, and came with three.  I was actually able to eat them all instead of wasting a lot, as I normally do with a small appetite...and for $3.50, it was fantastic.  The hashbrowns were also crisp and well seasoned.  As for the french toast, other reviewers have described it, and I agree with them:  a little dry, but nothing a dousing of syrup can't cure.  The crunchy almonds and fresh berries on top are a great touch.  My iced vanilla latte was delicious, and my pup enjoyed the misters on the patio.  Definitely recommended.",

We basked in the sun while we waited for our food, which honestly was a treat for us. Having breakfast al fresco in February is not an option back home in Canada lol  Our eggs benny and breakfast grilled cheese sandwiches arrived not long after we ordered and we dug in. For $10, you get A LOT of food! My traditional benny came with a side of potatoes o'brian and a stack of fruit. The ham was thicker than I'd prefer. Had it been shaved down to thinner slices, it would have gone better with the delicate poached eggs and fluffy english muffin. It did have a great smokey & sweet flavour to it though.  Knowing I wouldn't be able to finish my meal, it was nice to know packing it up meant I could enjoy a second round of it later on :)  A breakfast place that takes resos (even though we didn't need to make any), has delish breakfast and a patio wins a spot in my good books!",

Our Uber driver informed us this place is great and almost always has a wait, but we used the Yelp Waitlist function and wandered around this gorgeous area of town for about 25 minutes after checking in, and then were seated promptly.  Their \"BK\" iced coffee with hazelnut and a combination of other flavors and cream is excellent. I had the signature French toast, which was essentially a slightly elevated and well-executed standard French toast with berries and candied nuts.  My husband loved the Border Bowl, which was a generous portion of eggs, hash browns, sausage, bacon, ham, pork, cheese, and green chili and hot sauces. Prices seemed reasonable for the portion sizes and this area of town. Overall, this was definitely my favorite brunch of our short vacation in the area.",

I had the Signature French toast: excellent. Had decaf coffee, which was from a press. (Service person said requests for decaf were so few, they found the press was better quality.). Coffee was excellent and had over 3 cups from the press.! Highly recommend.",

The good news is that you can head to the counter and order lattes, juices, tea, etc to hold you over before you actually sit down to eat. That helped control the slight hanger pangs that were starting to come up.  After perusing tons of great options, I ultimately ended up with the breakfast grilled cheese. Two of my favorite things served as one combo, there was no way I was going to pass this one up. This cheesy concoction was loaded two kinds of ooey gooey goodness and included eggs, bacon and hash browns into the mix as well. I'd recommend it and would most definitely eat it again. Best choice after a big hike? Probably not - but I don't regret my gluttonous decision.  Service was prompt, and water glasses were refilled quickly. I can see why this is such a popping spot in the area!",

The breakfast bartender was the consumate host.  He greeted everyone with a verbal high five & a fist bump.  The TVs were showing every sport anyone cared about. I ordered an Iced Coffee & he gave me a 30 ounce cup to-go.  Nice.    I had the spinach egg-white omelette and it was an all-star pick.  To my left and right were other single diners eating huevos rancheros and oatmeal bowls.  I felt instantly healthier just sitting there eating with the locals.  I felt like I was in the heart of Scottsdale and pumping thru my veins was Iced coffee.  I felt like I would leave this place thinner, tanner and with less wrinkles around my eyes.   When I was finished, the breakfast bartender offered to top off my Iced coffee in the to-go cup.  I though that was mighty generous but I didn't need 60 oz of caffeinated beverage on a Sunday.  Because I now needed a nap.",

Luckily, the wait was not long and we were seated shortly after we all grabbed a coffee for the wait.   I love that they serve fresh squeezed juice to order, and promptly ordered a grapefruit juice, which came in a gigantic glass. I also ordered an omelet with tons of veggies. It came with a small mountain of homefries. I added avocado on the side. This was a ton of food but I killed the plate and was satiated for hours.   My only gripe is that the check was placed on our table when we were just about halfway done our meals. The standard \"no rush!\" was directed our way, but I definitely felt a little rushed nonetheless. Our meal was paid for before I was even done eating! Aside from that, great spot.",

We ordered two omelettes, The Bird and Whole Hog. The Bird had no flavor and the Whole hog (our regular) just was not the same. Also had an order of French Toast and our friend requested to throw in a skillet to make it crispy, waitress said no problem. It did not come out crispy, and then she said that's the way it's served, but would see what she could do. Took it away and brought it back with no change. Ended up speaking to the manager to remove it from the bill. This has been a required stop when our friends visit, but has now been removed from our list. Seems their quality has gone down hill!",

Well, I haven't got my food yet and I want to warn the non locals to not be quick to think the breakfast club is anything special.   Overpriced drinks. Mediocre food. Cute servers. But that's the extent of it.   Should have tried Almo Cafe which is more in line with a real breakfast joint.   And the Bloody Mary was all show and no taste. Thanks for the chewy celery stick. Such a major disappointment.   And the food was \"eh\". What a waste of our morning. Denny's would have done the job, cost half as much and not taken 2 hours.   But hey, they have the young, cute, college co-ed girls dressed in tights if that's what you're looking for.   Shake my head how I ended up here.",

All the food was hot, tasty, and arrived at the table around the same time.   I'm really glad I tried their V-18 veggie juice mix. I'm drinking a bottled V-8 spicy juice mix right now at home and it's making me sad. V-8 is watery & weak. BC's V-18 juice is spicy, flavorful, and very fresh tasting.   The eggs benedict with filet worth it. The steak was tender and perfectly seasoned. The server was really nice when I asked if the regular melon fruit cup could be replaced with other fruit due to a melon allergy. Pancakes were pretty solid for restaurant pancakes.  Overall, it was about $20 per person.",

We were told the wait was about 50 minutes but in reality it was only 20 minutes.   So rare to have delicious coffee at a busy restaurant. I assume this was because of how fresh the coffee was since the restaurant was so full.  A really large and diverse menu with much appreciated customizable size portions (many items offer 1, 2, or 3 pieces, for example, for French Toast) with really tasty add-ons such as real whipped cream (for only .25), a warm fruit compote, and nuts. My breakfast was definitely memorable!  My husband loves spicy so he ordered something with chorrizo and pepper jack cheese. He said it is the best he has ever had from a restaurant. He's a tough one to please!  For what this place offers, they excel at their niche - breakfast. A very good value for the excellent service, choices, taste, portion size, and atmosphere.

Upon arrival the time wait was now 55 minutes, but bar was open seating.  We were lucky enough to get 3 open seats at the bar. The place was really crowded. I ordered the Huevos Con Masa and just thought it was okay. The corn bread was pretty good, but I wasn't a fan of the poach egg and the potatoes that come on the side lacked flavor. The Chili dish it came with help spice it up a little bit, but I have had better. I'm a huge brunch fan so it was a little disappointing. I also had the breakfast soda mixed with pineapple juice. Again nothing to write home about. The staff was really nice and it was definitely pack! I would probably give this place another try and order something different if I was back in the area.",

It was really crowded unlike other places nearby that serve breakfast/brunch.   The menu offers a great variety of items to choose from. I went with something simple and ordered 2 eggs (scrambled), bacon, toast and added hash browns for a slight up charge (7.35). I thought the hash browns were especially tasty and the bacon was crispy just as I had requested. My hubby ordered the breakfast burrito (13) with the extra sauce which they call \"monster style\". Please split this with someone and you will be much happier. It's a very large portion.   The atmosphere here is trendy and I like the openness of the restaurant. There's different seating options which is nice although most of the outside seating is right on Scottsdale road. We sat around the counter which I found enjoyable. Prices are reasonable and the service was good. Just don't expect anything fancy here. This is a cute casual breakfast joint.",

He really does not know customer service and has no knowledge of what a regular means for business. He completely turned me off of this place. He was not friendly, he made me repeat my order 3 times while he was putting it into the computer (still came out wrong). When my food came out he asked me how it tasted while I was in the middle of my first bite, he did not ask if I needed anything else I had to ask 2 different servers that weren't even behind the bar for silverware and hot sauce. Additionally he dropped the check while I was still eating(nobody else really was at the bar so I don't understand the rush)  he also wanted to charge me an additional 4bucks for a Togo Arnold Palmer that I have never had to pay for the 50+ times I have been there before. He said it was new policy or something. Either way I think he should see the value of someone who frequents the place over double charging someone. Regardless I will not be back I would rather give my breakfast business to a place like snooze, matts big breakfast or even daily dose!",

I was really impressed by the service. The hostesses knew what every single person on their extremely long list looked like. There was no annoying, loud screaming of names or stupid buzzer things. They personally walked up to each person to take them to their seats. It was refreshing. The tables turned really quickly and were promptly cleaned and re-sat within minutes. The service inside was just as good. We were greeted right away and ordered. The food didn't take forever and was DELICIOUS. I can honestly say it was the best eggs benedict I've ever had. The portions were huge for the price. Our coffees and waters will filled before they were even close to being empty. The place runs like a well-oiled machine. Its no surprise they are always as busy as they are. I plan on talking my family here when they come out for spring training. If you are coming from out of town I highly recommend you check it out.  Oh and bonus points for the large television playing the Syracuse game.",

The menu is pretty reasonable, only a little bit more expensive than your average breakfast restaurant. It's so funny how the mood in Scottsdale changes from Tempe...it seems like a lot of the customers of this restaurant have a more snobbish attitude...it's like hello, you're paying ten bucks for breakfast, not $100 so stop looking at us like we can't afford to eat here. Uggg...but what you can you do about ignorant people? So, back to the food...my favorite item on the menu here is the Chocolate Chip Pancakes. It's funny because I don't usually eat these but they are so great from here! Fluffy pancakes with just the perfect amount of chocolate. Yum-O!",

    "text": "After spending a few days in the general Phoenix area I was very pleasantly surprised to see this part of town. Finally some grass and clean neighborhoods. We did go to Old Scottsdale for supper but that was at night and it wasn't this nice. We came here for breakfast because, well... its the The Breakfast Club.   We decided to sit outside on their patio which was nice, even though it was literally along the road. A little noisy and next time I would sit on the other side of the building but nice anyway.  The service was prompt and we were sitting within seconds of arrival.  The menu was good. There were quite a few interesting things that you may not see on another menu. After careful deliberation we tried the Asparagus, Ham, Cheese and Onion custom omelet along with the Mignon Benedict for myself. On the menu as \"Mignon with Harris Ranch Filet, Sauteed Spinach, Bordelaise & Hollandaise\"  I thought what a great idea, Eggs Benny with a steak and to boot I had it with shredded hash browns. The hash browns were deliciously crispy and the fresh fruit on the side was good. I ordered the sauces on the side which I would do again but this was quite good. Tender steak, spicy hollandaise and some kind of mushroom sauce. I would order this again.  My wife enjoyed the omelet and it did look good although I didn't try it. the idea of asparagus with eggs didn't really appeal to me. She said the exact opposite in fact, declaring that she loved asparagus in omelets. Maybe some other time for me.   Any way, this is the first place in Scottsdale / Phoenix that I ate at and would recommend or return to. Pretty darn good.",

Once we were seated, tt took about 20 minutes just for the girl to come take our order.  When she did wait on us, she was not pleasant and acted as if it was a bother for her to do her job. I ordered scrambled eggs and french toast. The waitress dropped off our food, without the eggs, didn't mention them, and ran off. We had to flag her down to say we were missing eggs, and she said \"she'll check.\" 10 minutes go by, we ask again, and eventually get them. If the wait staff did their job correctly, the wait for the restaurant would not be long at all. This place could be amazing if they could figure out the wait staff issue. As much as I loved the french toast, there are just too many restaurants with great customer service to go back to this one.",

I ordered the ham and eggs, and ordered my eggs \"over well\" and asked the waitress to have my yolks popped, because the sight of egg yolk running around my plate makes me ill. She had a little tude about \"over hard\" versus \"over well\", but I thought we had it settled...  My eggs came burned, with brown crispy crap all over them, and they were not hot. The toast came cold, with no butter or jam. The ham was okay, but \"off the bone\" is an exaggeration. The fresh fruit was good.   My husband's eggs and steak were not hot, and his toast came cold, with no butter or jam, as well.   He complained, and the waitress said she would bring new orders to us, at which time I told her to just forget it as far as my order went, because I was STARVING. She brought me a new order of eggs, and I said that I didn't want them, and off in a huff she went.   When my husband's (new) breakfast was delivered to the table, it was hot and everything was done correctly. However, no toast was present.   What bugs me about this place, besides the fact that we both were served cold food, is the attitude of the waitress.   Yeah, I get it, it's Scottsdale, but as a Scottsdale resident, I am embarrassed by the holier-than-thou attitude you get from some of the businesses here.   We hadn't been here in years, and now I know why.  Despite the long drive, we'll head back to Matt's Big Breakfast, which has THE freshest, most delicious breakfast in this area.

Portion size was good-large. Egg sandwich a great value w/some very delicious bacon. I love when chefs add a twist ~ chipotle to hollandaise ~ however this combo didn't work for us. Husband is a finicky eater (I'm certainly not) but both of us hard a time on that hollandaise. The menu has a lot of other great choices (check it out) so that's a plus.  I did enjoy my chai tea. Just a milk was $3.50. Food is reasonably priced; drinks are at coffee bar prices.    BEST THINGS: our server did forewarn us of hollandaise so we got it ~thankfully~ on the side /  good service though busy and mostly with a smile. Definitely goes a long way to bringing me back for another go.",

Food isn't bad, but they've never made that 4oz. $8.00 \"Harris Ranch\" filet well. I've boiled steak in the UK that tastes just as good for half the price.   Also, never have coffee here. Not at least their bar drinks. It's horrible, and the person taking your order will repeat it back to you to correctly three times, but you won't get the drink you ordered.  It's trendy little spot in the Old Town Scottsdale area, but that's about it.",

I went to add my name on the list for 3 of us and she said 20 min wait  So we looked at the menu and they had fresh fruit, and typical breakfast foods with a full coffee bar.   I ordered the southwest Rancho Huevos it came in a tortilla with eggs and cheese hot sauce and sliced pork. My girlfriend got an omelet and it came with huge slices of fresh fruit and potatoes with peppers. Her other girl friend got the four cheese omelet and could barley finish it. We all where stuffed and extremely happy with breakfast.   I would recommend this place with out a doubt to anyone in the area who is hungry for fresh breakfast.",

I suggested coming here with my boyfriend and his friend for his birthday since we were on this side of town. Big mistake. The hostess told us 25 minutes and we ended up waiting closer to 45 minutes. When our friend asked about the long wait they assured us that the 7 tables in front of us would be seated if we waited just 10 minutes more. I wish they would've just over estimated the time so we would be prepared for a long wait.   I have never been more embarrassed in my life to suggest a place when the hostess seated us at a wet table and threw the menus down and walked away after seating us. After that, it didn't matter how hip or delicious the food was, I am never going back here.",

    "text": "I'm going to rate this as a 3.5 stars rounded down to a 3. It's a great place, with solid brunch offerings that are perhaps a bit on the tame side. I've been here before, ages ago when they hadn't renovated yet. Unfortunately I don't live near Scottsdale anymore, and my husband moved in with me some time before we got married, so our reason for being in Scottsdale greatly diminished about a year or two ago.   That aside it's a great place to stop by when you're in the neighborhood. Parking is a bit of a b!#ch, pardon my french. It's old town Scottsdale, after all. And this place is always busy. That day I went it was packed with college kids on Spring Break and people in town for Giants spring training.   The waitresses are perky and the food is good. Nothing out of this world, but I've enjoyed everything I've had there. I think once I had an egg white omelette, another time their lox bagel plate. I do love that they have mimosas and bloody marys for you to order as well. Both were also good- the mimosa was fresh and tart, the bloody mary nicely savory and spicy.   There's a reason this place is always busy. It's in prime real estate and serves up solid food all the time. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if you're in the neighborhood and are craving brunch, you could do worse than stopping in here for food.",

All because I joined the waitlist on Yelp before leaving my hotel.  Breakfast Club gets crazy busy -- it's one of the few sit down breakfast/brunch spots in the area and, as a result, has a queue coming out the door between 9 am and noon. The servers are nice, the space is big, there's a patio, and plenty of healthy combined with not-so-healthy menu options.  As I mentioned above, I found Breakfast Club on Yelp, saw that they had about a 12-25 minute wait so I hit the \"Join the Waitlist\" button on the app and headed that way. It was about a 10 minute walk from the hotel and by the time I got there plus checked in with the hostess, they had a table ready. It was just that simple.  Tinga Chicken Frittata is a very filling breakfast. For two. Except there was just me eating, so I only ate half. If only TSA would let travelers bring their restaurant leftovers on the plane, I would've gladly taken it to-go. Alas, I didn't want a full cavity search over an egg dish in a box, so I had to bid farewell to this big ol' plate of food.   From \"front door\" (of my hotel) to paying the check, it was a 45 minute experience. With free wifi! Not a complaint from this one at all...",

We went on a Tuesday morning and waited maybe 2 minutes as I wanted outdoor seating. That being said it is loud, as you are very close to the busy Scottsdale street. I didn't mind this but I noticed at least two other tables asking to be reseated inside. The weather was gorgeous so my bestie and I just scooted our chairs closer so we could gossip. The menu is great, lots of healthy options. We got the lean and green omelette and and the salmon eggs Benedict. They were both great and the omelette was a decent size. The fresh fruit was delicious. We also had a side of the breakfast potatoes. I tend to always have to tell people to do them \"crunchy\" as I don't like mine soggy. They were perfectly crispy when I got them after giving the server my request. The only downfall, I didn't care for the staff that was doing the seating. Kind of rude to be honest. I loved our server outside but definitely not impressed with the people who are supposed to be the hosts/hostesses. They were quite short with a lot of people as we were waiting to be sat. Maybe they were having an off day but definitely need to tighten up! Overall, I can't let that one thing take away my five star review as the food, our server and experience was great!!",

They use fresh ingredients and the wait staff is outstanding. I do recommend however you make reservations whenever you can because this place gets packed on Sundays. The weight could be anywhere between 30 to 40 minutes but its worth it. They have a wide variety of breakfast options and the atmosphere is also welcoming",

Unfortunately The staff that works there can never get anything right and we always have to get our food made two or three times and it is completely ridiculous. The teenage manager that came up to us was very kind however didn't offer us anything until we finally decided to leave. They remade our food four times and they could not get it right it is quite disappointing I wish I knew where the breakdown is and I would fix this company.  Our waitress Chelsea was kind but it seems like she didn't understand anything we told her & she seemed overwhelmed and shouldn't be in the service  . My girlfriend has ten years plus experience and was shocked how all around no one put in any effort to make the situation better.  Food good, service terrible.",

My son got the breakfast burrito with chorizo and it was good but a little spicy. Although my son likes spicy things. My daughter got the grilled chicken on a bagel with chipotle sauce and it was good. It comes with choice of side.  She got a side salad.  They also have good black tea but it's not regular black tea.  It has a little bit of a fruity taste to it which is Good if you like that.

    "text": "Decent food, definitely not worth the wait.   BC is across the street from the Montauk on corner of N Scottsdale Rd. & Stetson. Parking can be a little tricky because there is no parking lot, but there are quite a few 3 hour free spots down Stetson.   My bf & I came for Sunday brunch. Having found BC on Yelp, we joined the waitlist a few minutes before leaving our house, which about 15 minutes away.  When we arrived we checked in with the hostess, who advised our wait would be about another 15-20 minutes for inside seating, which we wanted. Close to half hour later, two spots opened up at the bar & jumped on them. As we were leaving, we noticed that several parties who had checked in a few minutes after we arrived were still outside waiting for tables.   BC has a great selection of coffee specialities, but we were disappointed they were served in paper cups with plastic lids & not well made. My bf ordered the cafe au lait, which was so bad he sent it back & switched to drip coffee.    Overall, the food is well executed, basic breakfast staples at really reasonable prices. I ordered the traditional eggs benedict, my bf ordered the border bowl with avocado. My eggs benedict had perfectly poached eggs (runny yolks and set whites) on top of thick-sliced, grilled ham over a nicely toasted english muffin, topped with hollandaise. The hollandaise had a good flavor, but was too thick and not creamy. I substituted hash browns for O'Brien potatoes, which had a nice crispy exterior. My bf enjoyed his border bowl, but its presentation was definitely lacking & looked like it had been put through the garbage disposal before it made it to his plate.   Our server was very pleasant, but was taking care of the entire bar (about 18 seats) & didn't have time to check in with us. We had to flag down another server walking by for refills on our coffee, hot sauce, etc.   Overall, we enjoyed our brunch, but we will be sticking to Breakfast Kitchen Bar where the service is more attentive & the coffee is better & served in real mugs.",

The staff is friendly and while we were waiting for the coffee order multiple people checked in to make sure we were being helped.   The ice coffee was very refreshing and our group ordered the quick start, quick start conscious and the traditional bene. I had the quick start conscious which came with egg whites, broccoli, tomato and a side of cottage cheese and fruit. It was fresh, filling and felt guilt free indulging. The traditional bene was a big hit with the group as well.  If you're in the area, I would definitely recommend stopping in for some breakfast!",

The hostesses and our waitress were very professional and seemed to know exactly what they were doing.  We lacked for nothing and didn't wait for anything either.  I opted for the breakfast burrito. The description said two eggs, but this bad boy was huge!  It was also a good blend of flavors, especially when a little hot sauce was added to the mix.  I neglected my poor potatoes because I wanted to experience as much of the burrito as possible.  We easily split the check between the three of us and were  our way.

For breakfast we had the oatmeal, BC bagel, Lean and Green omelette and Huevos Rancheros. All the food was fresh and great. The service was welcoming as well as efficient. The reason for one star off is the noise level. Why do Scottsdale restaurants do this? There's plenty of noise from the activity and then they add loud music on top of it. We had to nearly shout just sitting a 4-top. If the weather is cooperating, definitely suggest outside for that.",

It has the right amount of spice and flavor to compliment the nicely cooked eggs.  The Mignon Benedict with hash browns - I see where they were going with this but it really just didn't work; please leave the mignon for the steakhouse.

The servers are always quick and friendly. The drinks are huge for only $10! Can't beat a huge mimosa for that price! My friend and I always get the same thing because it's so good. I've been getting the Tuscan omelet with adding sausage and I can't get enough. I can't describe how good the omelet is. It's so unique it's delish. I love pesto and this omelet is covered in it with tomatoes and mozzarella. There is no meat so be sure to add some if that's your sort of thing. And those potato skins with peppers oh my gosh.   Writing this review is making me hungry and I just decided that I'm going here this weekend. I can't resist!   Edit. Every time we're here the severs who are ready to leave steal our salt and pepper mid meal and it's getting obnoxious. We come here a lot and it happens every time. They don't even ask me which bugs me even more. Im still eating I expect to be able to keep my condiments. There's plenty of empty tables they can fill im not sure why they need mine as well right away considering they are hours from closing..",

It was definitely spicy which I really liked. Our waitress was less than enthusiastic but I can't really fault her for that--seems like a busy spot. Service nevertheless was super fast and we were in and out within 30 minutes. If you want something more relaxed and slow paced this may not be the spot, but for our purposes it was perfect.",

They won't seat partial parties, so plan ahead for that too.    On my most recent visit I had coffee and Eggs  Benedict.  Their coffee is truly amazing . . . very rich without being bitter.  The Eggs Benedict was also very good, with hand cut pieces of ham and REAL hollandaise.   Service always quick and efficient.  Some servers are more friendly and chatty than others, but I've always had good service.    My one issue (and why I ave four stars rather than five) is the increasing garlic content in the sausage gravy.  My regular favorite in the past was always the biscuits and gravy (with jalapeno biscuits . . . mmmm).  Over my last several visits, the sausage gravy has been extremely garlicky, and not nearly as tasty as it used to be.    Overall, a The Breakfast Club is great place to eat, with good service and really good food.  I'll definitely be back, and maybe even try the gravy again someday.",

I've over decade of experience in the industry, opened restaurants and trained people across the coast so this I feel like I have a tad of credibility. I sat at the bar and was greeted or better yet, \"acknowledged\" by the brunette girl working this area. She never once smiled, asked me any questions about menu, If I've been there etc. flopped down the menu and walked away. I ordered the lox/cream cheese set up because I do think they do a good job here with that. Coffee is horrible but the food came out quick. It was $14 but it's Scottsdale and was a good amount so I don't mind. She dropped the check half way through my meal without asking how anything was. I pain, left $4 on $17. Over 20%. She picked up the check, entered her tip in the computer and never looked back to say thank you. Food was good, service was 1 star. Not only will I not come back, I won't refer anyone or bring visitors. This type of experience gives Scottsdale its pretentious reputation.  Deuces B-club.",

Therefore, I recommend you find a day off, like a Tuesday morning to check it out. You'll get better faster service, wont be all noisy and you'll really be able to enjoy what this place has to offer: which is a very good staff and bright enjoyable atmosphere.   Food: The food menu is decent, but nothing to write home about. You'll have your normal southwest breakfast dishes, pancakes, omelets, and skillets. I guess what they are known for are their selection of Benedict style eggs using different types of genres with hollandaise. Cant complain.   Overall, its a solid stop and a place you should check out. It may end up being your fav breakfast place as many of my friends state that it is. I however put it as a solid back up to my favorites if they are too packed. All in all, I recommend, but its not at the very top.",

I'm a real breakfast fan and therefore look for good breakfast places whenever I travel, which is often.  The Breakfast Club remains one of my favorites.  Love the BC Breakfast Sandwich and the Breakfast Grilled Cheese.  The service has always been excellent and though there is often a wait, it's worth it. They are also more than happy to modify a dish to your specifications.  I typically order one of the large mimosas and the only criticism is that the orange juice is a little bitter, however I attribute that to the fact they used fresh squeezed juice which is worth the trade off.",

My girlfriend and I each had eggs benedict and coffees, and it was 40 bucks!  Second reason, the portions are huge.  I am always disappointed to see such huge portions coming out of a professional kitchen, because I realize how much food is headed toward the trash bin each day.  If you must serve such huge portions, please advise on the menu ahead of time.    The most important reason I won't head back here...  unripened fruit as a garnish on my plate.  Just serve me what's in season please.  If it is in season, a tomato in summer for example, please make sure it's fresh, local, and ripe.  I was shocked when the waitress asked me if I wanted to add tomato to my dish and then she served me a hard, barely pink slice of tomato.  It's in season people!  Where did this tomato come from, South America?",

    "text": "When you're looking for a big breakfast or brunch to devour in the Old Town Scottsdale neighborhood, this is one club you'll want to belong to. Now, although you don't have to actually own a membership to this club, you may feel like you need to belong to some of Scottsdale's \"downtown elite\" to visit this joint.  If you're looking for good breakfast food - hearty omelets with fruit and potatoes or wonderfully aromatic pancakes - then this place is for you. They have a great menu of plates, and you can tell that people line up for the flavor. I've had several omelets of theirs, with my most recent dish being overeasy huevos with a salsa-style ranchero sauce over jalapeno cornbread. It was delicious albeit heavy because of the cornbread - a truly savory Southwestern dish.   The Breakfast Club is usually filled with a mix of Scottsdale residents, hungover ASU students, and out-of-place-out-of-towners. But the majority is Scottsdale's old town elite - which include the entitled teens and young \"adults\" of the city. It's an interesting spot to go people watching at, because you get to see some diversity and laid back attitudes amidst the pretentiousness of Scottsdale.  I actually would have given this place a fifth star if the hostess hadn't made a mistake on her seating list. My diner friend and I put our names on the list and went next door to the shops to kill time...30 minutes after our return (standing outside, right in front of the hostess), we asked if we would be seated anytime soon - because it had been 20 minutes past our quoted time, and we were told that we had been taken off the list. I guess the hostess assumed that our walking away meant that we wouldn't wait - but we never said that. So the beginning of our brunch was an annoying bummer...but I guess that's what you get when you're surrounded by a city of plastic and makeup instead of logic.",

We yelped this place before-hand and walked over here from our hotel, checked out the menu and decided to go with this place. The wait to be seated was about 15 minutes. The place itself was super cozy. They had a little barista in the back to grab coffee while you waited.   I ordered the Bello Bene which was their vegetarian option for the eggs benedict. It had portabella mushroom, hollandaise, and bordelaise sauce on an english muffin with of course eggs. Yum, the sauces were delicious. My mouth waters when I think about it. It also comes with homestyle potatoes and cantaloupe. I was craving a waffle, so I ordered a regular belgian waffle with just butter and syrup...$7. A little on the pricey side for a regular ass waffle if you ask me, but regardless it was good.  Would I come here again? Sure. It was better than US egg (another breakfast spot in Scottsdale). It was also very convenient, within walking distance from our hotel and to the stadium.",

The restaurant is small and the outdoor seating is placed in the middle of a fairly busy Scottsdale sidewalk. The wait is usually long and there isn't much room to wait without feeling like you are in the way of a waitress.  Their breakfast potatoes are very good but the entrees have left me a bit unsatisfied. My lunch experience has been better in that the Buffalo Mozz Salad is worth going back for if you're in the neighborhood. It  offers a large portion of caprese salad with a heaping pile of mixed greens. Yum!  All-in-all... a decent meal but often too busy with beautiful people to be worth the wait.",

After waiting so long I was really excited to eat, unfortunately the food was really nothing special. I would recommend staying away from the crab benedict which tasted fishy and obviously came from a can. The strawberry pancakes were good and overall the portions were very big. The service was ok but nothing great. Our waitress maybe smiled once which is cool, but don't act all put out when I remind you about that side of bacon you forgot.   I'm completely baffled as to why anyone would wait for 45 minutes for The Breakfast Club. I don't think we'll be heading back.",

So I came in and was waiting on my boyfriend, I asked for a booth because he had back surgery. The lady told me yes that they had an open booth waiting for me, to let her know when he got here I said ok and that I could go ahead and sit because we were in a hurry that I was going to order our food. She insisted that this wasn't possible that they had a policy that didn't let me sit until my whole party was here. I understand that if there is a huge party but he was down the road and we were in a rush. So this booth sat empty until he got here. Seems a little ridiculous to go out of your way to make sure you didn't provide a little convenience to someone. I'm more likely to go down the road to morning squeeze or chop shop than back here.

The only thing is that it's never anything SUPER SPECIAL to have that kind of a wait.  Most of the time i drive by to see if it's packed or not-if i wanna go in, and 8/10 times its a line out the door.    But i will say this-it's super consistent.  i've never had a bad order or anything like that and it is reasonably priced as well-so if you don't mind waiting for breakfast-give it a try!",

    "text": "I've eaten here 3 or 4 times and my second to last experience was not good and I hadn't been back in awhile. However, a friend wanted to meet up there and have breakfast this morning so I decided to give it another try. To my disappointment the 2nd chance experience was just as terrible as my first bad experience if not worse. I don't feel bad for writing this negative review either because my friend (who suggested the place) was appalled as well by our time there.  If you only have 20-30 minutes to grab a bite to eat then I would recommend this place. Other than that I won't be coming here again. Try the Orange Table for better food and better service. Upon my arrival I went to the host stand where two girls were present. I requested a table for 2 and the blond RUDELY informed me that they didn't sit incomplete parties. I have no problem with that, I work at a restaurant with the same policy but the tone of voice of how you tell people is always key and hers was definitely rude. When we finally got sat there was miscommunication between the two girls working and it was clear that the brunette hostess was having a serious problem with her fellow blond coworker. My friend and I shook it off and were simply happy to be sitting at a table with our hopes of breakfast on the way.  The service started out ok, but because we're servers as well my friend and I were prompt in ordering and made it easy. Food was out quickly which was nice but I wasn't pleased with the quality as I have been times before. My omelette was extremely oily, which is never something you want especially when you order an eggwhite veggie omelette, and my potatoes were undercooked. The fruit was mostly what I ate. After about 15- 20 minutes of dining our server came over and dropped off the check. My friend and I were both not even half way through our breakfast, forks full with the next bite, and our server Bethany didn't even offer us anything else while my coffee sat 3/4 empty awaiting a refill (which I finally had to ask someone else for). We were a little put off that she dropped the check so soon and we both felt rushed. After another ten minutes Bethany came back and offered us coffees to go. A nice gesture but the fact that we hadn't even touched the check and were still eating simply stated that she wanted us gone. We looked around the restaurant wondering if they were waiting on our table for something but noticed that there were 3 or 4 empty table around us and nobody waiting by the host stand so we didn't think so. Upon checking my watch I noticed that we hadn't even been there 45 minutes.  We continued to enjoy what we could of our breakfast but at this point we felt so rushed that we sat there til the last second possible before we had to go. This experience fell hand in hand with my last negative experience where I was literally told to leave by the busser after an hour and a half because people were waiting. Like I said I'm a server myself but these people are so eager to turn tables that it simply takes the enjoyment out of going out to breakfast and having a nice meal with a fancy mimosa. If I do go to the Breakfast Club again it will be at there downtown location but that will be no time soon. If you're in Old Town looking for a good breakfast joint save the rushed feeling that they put on you and enjoy it somewhere else like the Orange Table or Morning Squeeze. Even Daily Dose right down the road have good breakfast! The BC just isn't worth it any more.",

Secondly, the fact that they have dog friendly patio service elevates the place in my book.  Our trips to Scottsdale aren't complete until we make a stop here for breakfast.  The portions are huge!  The surprising part is that the food is good, which is not usually the case with places with places that do large portions (usually hoping that size covers up the taste).  With their Mexican options such as the breakfast burrito or huevos ranchero... They knock the cover off the ball.  The green chil pork in the huevos rancheros is fantastic and keeps me coming back for it.",

The Banana Fosters Pancakes were good - but you have to be in the mood for sweet and indulgent.  It's topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  I have also had the Challah French Toast.

We waited a few minutest then decided to sit anyways and at least start with coffees for the two of us.  The hostess  relented and said she would seat us but we'd have to wait to order until our third got there.  Kept saying...\"its our policy\".  Walked out and went across the street... apparently hostess doesn't realize there are lots of choices in downtown Scottsdale.  Sadly, the wait staff are great there just hostesses need more training.  As marketing guru Seth Godin might say... some people just don't know why they are in business.

OKAY.. some things I LOVE.. such as the eggs benedict.. its worth the splurge..but I get the hollandaise sauce (with a hint of chipolte in the mix) on the side... The coffee is strong and I love it! They carry the sugar in the raw, 'stevia'.. that rates high with me, even though somewhere in Cali that would not be a special thing..but I love the small things when I get them in AZ. Ive had their huevos rancheros.. wont do that again.. its not like any Ive had before.. so give the chef a 'A' for going the creative way on the rancheros! BUT after a nite at the W.. it made me feel not great.. its overpowered in sauce... and the tortilla covering the bowl was weird to me.. too much.  BUT again, I give it 3 stars bc for here its a great place to grab any kind of breakfast you want.. Challah french toast, pancakes, coffee bar.. and still watch the cutesy Scottsdale---ites.. weekends plan to wait!",

    "text": "I effing LOVE TBC.  Located smack dab in the middle of \"the scene\" its Truely the best breakfast place in town.  Apparently its the thing to do to actually shower and change from the night before prior to arriving so you can watch the rest of us stumble in looking like hell.  Whatever.  While you wait for a table (and you WILL wait for a table), sit outside on the patio and people watch some of Scottsdale's finest.    The Breakfast club isnt all about being the \"it\" place to be though, its also about the food.  Those of you who just came from the gym might want to try the egg white veggie omelet or the best oatmeal this side of the Mississip...  Those of us nursing a killer hangover might stick to the cinnamon challah french toast, benedict-style eggs, or belgian waffles...  You'll never want your loser boyfriend to make you breakfast in bed again.  Lunch at TBC is round two of fabulousness.  Salads, sandwiches, sweet potato fries...  I'm suddenly starving.  Dont let the line or the wave of D&G sunglasses outside deter you from waiting for the best meal of the week at the Breakfast Club.",

    "text": "MEH.   One would think that this place would (and could) pay homage to the cult film, The Breakfast Club. But when you see the interior, you immediately notice how bare the walls are. The rest of the decor is plain and boring, too. This places looks like something you'd find in Terminal D of an airport. MEH.   Service is spotty. My lunch date and and I ended up having to ask permission to sit somewhere, since nobody acknowledge our entrance and earnest appraisal - where do we sit? do we wait to be seated?   The menu offers a range of things to pick from, though don't expect to be blown away by your options. They are of \"average\" variety. Sure, some looked intriguing, like the eggs benedict with crab.   Of course, we had coffee. This would be, in my opinion, the best thing they offer. All I needed was a little cream and presto... the coffee was delish!  For lunch I ordered a chicken sandwich with bacon, with a side of sweet potato fries. Of the latter, I ate about 20. Just okay. I ate 1/2 the sandwich and noted that I could have easily made this at home. My date commented that he was expecting his sandwich on dark marble rye. While the food was okay, it wasn't great. And considering I hadn't yet eaten all day (and this was 2 p.m.) you would think that an average sandwich would taste like the tears of Jesus by this point. Nope. It was merely MEH.   I have no reason to go back here.",

But all the same, a place that does a great cup of coffee and breakfast gets high marks in my portfolio.  Candidly, The Breakfast Club always intimidated me - the crowd that is there all day long. Because, let's be honest, if a place is THAT crowded all the time, it has to be fantastic, right? I didn't get it, for the longest time...then there was Eli.   I sidled up to the coffee bar, a nervous wreck. I wasn't sure if this was a place I could eat, drink, both, or if it was for Take Out (by the way, its all of the above). And, I started to ask questions. Eli is his name. It seems that he runs this joint on the weekends and he's got one hell of an ear (read: don't gossip about anyone or anything) and a smarty-pants sense of humor; but, he was open to questions and he lead me through all the ins and outs of the Breakfast Club.   My biggest piece(s) of advise: Use The Boards. They are not just for decor and their kitchen will make anything for you. Make your own omelette. Add a side of green chili to anything. Order a drink from Eli on a weekend day. Sit at the back bar and eat, read your paper, eat your Lox, and have a second cappuccino. Is it perfect? Is anyone? Probably not, but now that I've seen how they intended the restaurant to be used, I understand the crowd and I'm one of the many that will return...",

Candied nuts on a hot crispy yet soft waffle. Delicious.  I'll be back to try some other waffles!",

Otherwise, it was pretty bland stuff. Ironically, the menu looks uber creative, but the execution? Not so much. Case in point: the ballyhooed cinnamon challah french toast was dried out and had no custardy center at all, plus the side of scrambled eggs was also extremely dry.   Servers were OK, though seemed very not thrilled to be there. In the end, that's a fair attitude, I guess, since neither were we.",

One of the reasons I like it is because they DON'T have a bar, so there's no possible way for me to order a mimosa or screwdriver. Sometimes the best way to live a healthier life is to just avoid the temptation all together.   I've been going to Breakfast Club for years, so this review is based on several visits, not one particular experience. A lot of people dog on this place for being too \"Snottsdale\" (and I've surely seen that attitude SOME of the time), but overall, I've had good experiences here.   First off, great bacon....thick and yummy. I suggest ordering a side order when you first sit down (you know...as a \"breakfast appetizer\"). Second, good coffee. Last, last but not least, the food. I LOVE their breakfast burrito and can't seem to order anything else. I recommend it \"Monster Style,\" smothered in pork green chile and chorizo queso. Then, I recommend that you walk about 5 miles to stave off heart failure. It's a lot of food.",

My wife and I recently had breakfast here - the famous French toast covered with fruit and nuts.  We waited an hour for our seat.  This is understandable on a Saturday morning.  The service was very good, the coffee expensive, and the famous French toast had dropped in size and quality.  The fruit was skimpy as well.  We left thinking we are \"over\" the Breakfast Club and there are several better places for breakfast in the Valley.  When visiting with close friends who live nearby us, they shared that they had independently come to the same conclusion a few weeks ago after a visit there.  I don't think we will need to review this place again.",

While waiting we saw several people walk in and were seated and it seemed the hostess did not have a plan for us to be seated and did not communicate with us at all, despite standing 5 feet from them.  We were \"next\" at about 45 minutes into our wait. At 1 hour and 10 minutes, hostess said a table was about to be ready for us and it would be about ten more minutes. Nearly an hour and half into the wait the manager came over but it was to late as we had reached 1.5 hours and our entire party was hangry!  Still there was no table available and no communication about their plan for us. Breakfast Club displayed NO CUSTOMER SERVICE today!  Kyle-Not sure what your hostess/staff reported, but to be crystal clear our entire party was present from the moment we arrived at your restaurant at 8:30.  They should just own up to their failure to be customer focused. Like I mentioned in my review, your staff showed NO customer service as we were the ones who initiated all communication regarding our status on your wait list. At the time we left your establishment, we were the only group standing 5 feet from your hostess stand; they knew how long we had waited!",

Now the pork and hollandaise  was tasty, but the hard egg pretty much killed an otherwise creative take on a classic.   My wife got a protein platter with steak. She asked for mid-well (I know.... I know ...). What she got was rare verging in blue and eggs that had zero flavor. Not much taste in the veg either.   The waitress was kind and offered to get new eggs but I had already consumed half the dish. It just didn't seem worth it. They did take the steak back, but then they just seared off the cut part and it was still rare throughout.   The waitress did take the protein platter off our ticket which is why this is  3 instead of 1. They maybe just had a bad day. But I probably won't choose to go back.",

The staff was super attentive... couldn't be happier with our experience. Price was on-point and location was absolutely perfect!",

    "text": "Our new favorite breakfast spot in the area!  As new \"locals\", we've been trying many places on a frequent basis. On Mother's Day, we decided to try this out and instantly became fans!  My #1 advice: CHECK IN via Yelp!    We checked in on our way to BC and were able to receive constant updates. Once we arrived, we were seated within 5 minutes. If we would've waited to put our names down after arriving, we could've easily waited for 50 minutes or longer. There is also a parking lot adjacent to the restaurant, which is very convenient.   Once seated, Ryan and I tried their amazing Bloody Mary! It has be one of the best Bloody Marys we've ever had! The rest of the review can be solely on the Bloody Mary but we'll move on!  Service was outstanding. Our hostess and waitress were very friendly, attentive, and quick! Our food came out  fast considering how busy it was. Everything (Salmon Bene, Pancakes, and Southwest burrito) was fresh and super delicious!  Although we sat inside, there is also outdoor & bar seating available . The restaurant is at the intersection of Scottsdale & Drinkwater- perfect for people watching ;)  I also received a complimentary chocolate covered strawberry for Mother's Day! How cute is that?!   We highly recommend!",

The cold brew was also listed with three different prices, so I thought they had pitchers, but they actually only have two sizes (I think it's 8 and 16 oz... not positive).   To eat, I had the chicken fried chicken which was very small and mostly consisted of fat, which made it very hard to chew. The flavor on the fried outside was delicious, and I'm sure if the meat had been more tender, it would've been delicious.   All in all, probably wouldn't go back. The wait is very long even if you use the Yelp waitlist. I think I waited 30 min on Yelp, then got to the restaurant and waited another 45 min. Definitely go on a weekday or very early weekend, if at all.",

Overall, the service is very attentive and I plan on coming back again when I'm in town!",

It was super packed and we had to wait almost an hr for a table which was fine with me it gave us a chance to hang outside and people watch :-).   We were all starved once we were seated so we ordered right away. I started with coffee and decided to go with one of their club plates that came with eggs, potatoes O' Brien, toast and fruit...for my meat I decided to go with sausage. The plate looked amazing when it came out but I was really disappointed with how bland everything was...the eggs which I requested to be scrambled with cheese were bland, the sausage and potatoes were also blah. I felt like I had all of this food and I was just eating it because I was hungry. The best part of the meal was the toast and the fruit, you can't mess that up! At least the service was decent :-)  I may give this place a do over but I may have to come during the week so I don't have to wait an hr for a table.",

The things I really enjoyed were the french toast (challah bread) and the fruit bowl (strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, pineapple, and a few others). The things that left me wanting more were the turkey sausage, pancakes, and omelettes. I just felt meh about it.. but the french toast was amazing. One of my dining mates had the \"special\" which was french toast covered in fruit. I'd totally go back for that.  It's a cute restaurant with True brunch/breakfast hours and outdoor seating. Great for people watching!",

I don't think that we received the best treatment; the servers were nice enough, but always seated us in the glaring sun or under a mister or in some other lackluster location. Also, the chairs outside are cheap plastic lawn furniture.  I will go again, but I do not expect to be treated the same way as, say, an attractive group of young men might be.",

Food came surprisingly quick, about 10 minutes after we sat down. Menu is sort of pricey, well, mostly because it's in Old Town Scottsdale, but the food portion is pretty generous. We tried the Quick Start Conscious which has 4 eggs and a lot of veggies and a bowl of cottage cheese. it's pretty good, very fresh. My cousin tried Border Omelet, or something like that, which tuned out to be a tex-mex type of food. It's huge, and delicious.   So, besides the long wait, everything else is pretty good!",

    "text": "Had breakfast here, thought it was going to be a treat since there were all these people waiting out front and there was a 20 min wait for a table inside.  I ordered the wild mushroom omelet and my friend ordered the blt with cottage cheese since they didn't serve sweet potato fries yet apparently.  (I wasn't too impressed with the menu selections either btw, there was like 5 salads and 6 sandwiches for lunch, but i guess it is BREAKFAST club) The omelet wasn't very good - I'm not sure if it was because I should've ordered a meat along with the mushroom or the 1/4 lb brick of cheese inside but overall it was bland and the cheese was just ridiculous even after I pulled the excess goo out.  No amount of ketchup, salsa, Tabasco or Patio could salvage it.  My friend was nice enough to trade with me halfway through and the BLT was ok, but I gotta say this even though it feels wrong - there is too much bacon.  There would be a pile of 5 strips of thick sliced bacon in each bite and whereas I do love bacon, it was a bit overpowering.  Not to mention, between each slice was a thick layer of grease which made me wonder if they cooked it in layers in the oven???  Anyways, after I pulled out all but 2 layers the balance seemed restored AND my friend got some meat for the omelet.    All in all - the service was great, the hash browns were good and I loved the strips of red and yellow peppers in it, but did not like the menu selections which were pretty limited and the entrees.  The omelet had more cheese than egg, and the BLT had more bacon than LT and bread combined.",

Unless you go during the weekdays or early morning on the weekends, expect to wait upwards to 45 minutes.

We arrived sometime around 10am on a Sunday morning and were able to be seated within five minutes, which was nice.  I ordered the turkey/avocado/boursin omelet.  (This normally comes w/ mushroom but I got it without).  All I can say is wow!  This was a delicious omelet, I literally ate the whole thing (though I did slow down for a moment so my wife could taste a bite).  The service was good, though a little slow on bringing the check, though after that I did appreciate that they didn't pressure us to leave while we caught up, even though a line had formed.

It was definitely way more omelet than I could chew, but it was cheaper in the end than doing a two egg omelet because it came with potatoes and fresh fruit. Everything was cooked to perfection: Flavorful, but not too heavy for an early morning meal. I washed everything down with some tangy grapefruit juice, which I'll say wasn't as good as I can squeeze at home, so save your $2.50 and perk up with a specialty coffee bev from the espresso bar.",

I don't mind waiting but we could've went else where for breakfast and gotten our breakfast faster. The food was pretty good but to be honest we immediately had to use the bathroom afterwards.  The service was good, I didn't get as much refills as I wanted but I still enjoyed the waitress, she was friendly. The woman in the front was expressionless towards us, I don't know if that's just her personality, or had a bad morning, or she just didn't like us for some reason. If you decide to come here I would come prepared to wait awhile and be careful what you order.",

I even ended up sitting next to someone who used to be a server there and she still comes in for breakfast often. She made some wonderful suggestions.

They have indoor seating and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is great during the cooler months but I would avoid it during the hot months for sure.  The menu has your typical sandwiches for lunch and breakfast options. I decided to try the breakfast grilled cheese. For the price it was huge and they even added avocado to it as well as tomatoes. If anything get your egg over easy, it gives it an even better taste. We tried the side of biscuits and gravy and it was amazing! Definitely worth it even though they were a bit on the pricey side.  I would have loved to have given this place 5 stars but the prices were a little high for what we received and the parking was a bit of a mess. Also call in reservations if possible so you don't have to wait as long. Definitely worth a visit if you are near Scottsdale on a Sunday and searching for brunch.",

The crispy tortilla was a good touch--though it got to be a bit much after all of the liquids from the beans, salsa, egg, etc. all soaked in.  I would've opted for refried beans instead of the (somewhat watery) black beans and could have done with some spicier or more flavorful salsa (spicy tomatillo salsa is my personal favorite), but all in all, it was a nice time out with my lady.  The kombucha was a good option and was as pricey as you'd expect for such trendy things.",

The iced coffee was incredible, so delicious and strong--the wait time flew by.    The menu options are incredible.  I had so much trouble deciding which omelet I wanted, so a few of my friends and I ordered 3 and split them in thirds.  My favorite one included mozzarella, tomatoes and pesto. They are large enough to do that, and are served with roasted veggies, potatoes and melon. Totally unique compared to the standard toast and hash browns that you normally get with an omelets.   Service was efficient and friendly, which I appreciated with the large group. Honestly, I can't stop thinking about brunch and wish I had more time in Phoenix to go back to The Breakfast Club.",

I ordered the tuna salad sandwich with cottage cheese on the side. The tuna was pretty run-of-the-mill, prepared with mayo, and sandwiched between lettuce leaves, tomatoes and two thick slices of 9 grain bread. The large dill pickle spear was a nice touch. I love cottage cheese, so that's a thumbs up. My bf's breakfast burrito was almost as large as his plate, seriously. It was huge, smothered with green chile and pretty tasty. Try as we might, there was no way we could finish our meals. I wish they had put the fruit on his plate separately, since some of the green chile sauce got onto it. Green chile covered watermelon just isn't very appetizing, you have to admit. I would go back, but only if I were in the area.",

No big deal she is only a host.. anyway our waitress was awful.. tired, lazy and I had to ask her for a hot sauce like 5 times she never offered to refill my drink however anytime my fiance was running low she seemed to notice she had a horrible attitude towards us both, my guess she was hung over..  Still no excuse. Terrible terrible service from the waitresses however the buss boys do an amazing job with assisting customers and are most of the reason I returned a second time.

    "text": "On my second official weekly brunch with my friend, we decided to hit The Breakfast Club up, and I really liked this place for Sunday brunch.  We had to wait for a little while, but it wasn't any more than I would expect to wait for a popular brunch spot.  We had the option to sit in or outside, and though we said the fastest seat was ok, we were secretly hoping to sit inside.  Lucky for us, our wish was granted and was seated inside.    My friend ordered the cinnamon challah french toast, which looked AMAZING.  It came topped with candied nuts, seasonal berries, and Vermont maple syrup.  I ordered the BC burro, which was egg, ham, cheese, and green pepper wrapped in a tortilla with a side of hashed browns.  Let me just tell you, BC knows how to do their hashed browns right!  Perfectly browned but not burnt.  The burro was pretty darn good, too, and came with a side of salsa, but I personally liked it better topped with ketchup.  Let me also state here that the burro was totally cheap: about five bucks.  The french toast was not as cheap, but it also was not any more expensive than other brunch places.  The coffee we ordered was awesome because it came hot and strong, which is perfect for a lazy Sunday morning, and the waitress was quick to come around with refills, too.    The reason I'm not giving this place a perfect five is for two reasons.  The first is that the waitress came back with a side of bacon for my friend, which he did not order.  It wasn't a big deal, but he doesn't eat meat, so it was gross for him, and he had ordered hashed browns, so technically, the order came out wrong.  The bigger issue was that about 80% of the way through eating his huge portion of french toast, my friend discovered a hair in it.  Lucky for the staff, my friend is not grossed out by hair found in food and just removed it, then continued to finish his meal with the idea that if he HAD eaten it, it'd have been considered more protein, but for normal people, finding a piece of hair in food is a deal-breaker, so I thought I'd mention it.  My food was fine, though, and it was good, so you go and make your own judgment call.  Oh, and I might also forewarn any of you who decide to go here that the parking situation is kind of crappy.  Just so you know.",

Many races are in here, but mostly your young frat or sorority friends.  I personally thought it was fun, but I can see families get a little bewildered by the place.  If you are a middle aged person who has a family, skip this place even though the food is good.  OR better yet, come in the late afternoon when the college kids are out and partying so you can avoid them.",

    "text": "This was my second trip here and both times I've been pleased but not overly impressed. The food is good, the service is good, the selection is good; I'd sum up that in general, it was 'good'. Not great, not amazing, not knock my socks off, but definitely 'I'll come back here again for breakfast'. Maybe I need to branch out of my comfort zone and try something different there, but honestly I'm a big fan of eggs, bacon, toast and hash browns. In that spirit I ordered the Quick Start Breakfast and everything came out as I'd ordered it, the Orange Marmalade was very good (if a little too sweet rather than fragrant) and the iced green tea is a very refreshing option especially here in the desert. It's a cute (if basic) atmosphere and I really like how they put alot of their menu up on the chalkboard above the coffee bar, it looks very hip and colorful. I definitely wouldn't sit and wait if there was a wait, when we came it was 9ish on a Monday so it was pretty easy to get a table.",

Sat down to nearly empty restaurant late on a Tuesday morning  when waitress finally came over , BF ordered diet coke and was told that they have Coke only. I ordered iced tea no lemon and got lemon and after I added a Splenda & tasted it it was fruit flavored which I don't like. When asked the server said it was black tea then admitted it was mango tea. So I said I'd just have water and after some eye rolling I finally got it. My tomato soup was ok but the grilled cheese had some burnt charcoal bits from the flattop. Boyfriend asked for cheddar in omelette and got  pepper jack(yuck) also asked for fruit but got barely warm potatoes O'BRIEN. More eye rolling when he asked for the fruit. This place seems to want to be a healthy hip place but with the bad service I got I wouldn't ever recommend or give them another dime.  Go somewhere ele",

If you want better Huevos Rancheros, head east to MPJ's Grill in Fountain Hills, you won't be disappointed.  My wife had the Eggs Bennie, and the hollandaise was cold.  Service was good, the price was reasonable for the amount of food, but not the quality.  Overall, I wouldn't go back.  Looking for something better in Scottssdale.",

Boy was I wrong.  My sister and I went there one morning for a light breakfast.  We got in there and the wait staff weren't friendly.  I don't think there know how to smile.  We ordered the 2 egg, bacon, toast that came with fruit. I order a cup of coffee.  Simple small breakfast.  The coffee was OK.   When I ordered I asked for eggs over medium ( can't stand running eggs) so what did I get you guessed it running eggs.  I only got 1 piece of bread for two eggs and the fruit wasn't ripe.  My sister ordered scrambled eggs and they were OK.   The waitress didn't ask how were were doing, did we like the food.  Nothing...  The vibe wasn't great in there it was a very negative feeling.  I don't suggest anyone wasting their money there...  Go to the Denny down the street..",

(im sure only like 5 calories too right??, ha ) And I have also had the eggs benedict with the portabello mushroom on it (don't remember what it was called) I dont eat meat so I get it with out it and with out the other sauce it comes with, but still get the hollandaise and man, its good! It has a little spice to it and I love spice.  The iced green tea is yummy also. The servings are big so you can always order to share (or if you cant decide, order a couple things and  share everything) When the weather is nice, I recommend sitting outside.

So, if you want a waffle with 2 fried eggs and some ham, you can do that; very nice!

Our waitress was very kind and attentive but that's the only good thing I experienced.",

Waking up on eastern time in the PDT landed us there at opening, and 30 mins later they were packed. I can't imagine the Saturday @ 930a wait.   The breakfast bowl was piled high with pulled pork, could have upped the awesome with more veggies and cheese in the scramble, but it still wins. The Lean and Green omelette was a great choice, especially paired with the biscuits and gravy. We also ordered one slice of the French toast... Amazing.  Lastly, they have a really creative bar. The bloody was better than most, and the Salty Dog came with fresh squeezed grapefruit juice... so good you have to have two of them!",

As our table was going to take about 15 minutes, I went ahead and ordered a couple large iced coffees. Nothing fancy about them but they were $4 a piece which I thought was a tad steep. That, however, is my only gripe. My wife and I both got the breakfast grilled cheese. It was PHENOMENAL. Eggs, hash browns, cheese and bacon on perfectly toasted bread - so good. We also got one buttermilk pancake to share with was light, airy and delicious. The total for the food was around $20 which is perfect. We will definitely be back to Breakfast Club next time we're in the area!",

That was very convenient considering how busy brunch spots in Phoenix/Scottsdale get. Very chill, trendy place right in Old Town. They squeeze fresh orange and grapefruit juice on site which is great; most places have canned juice squeezed elsewhere and brought to location.  Service was fast and our server was helpful answering questions about the menu My husband got the huevos racheros which he thought was good. The menu doesn't mention that pork is already included in the dish without having to add it on additionally.  I made a \"healthy\" choice with the lean green omelet - bad  decision! The omelet was very greasy and tasteless. I would go bak to this place but would definitely get something else.  Even if you're getting your own food orders, definitely try a small side of french toast!",

It reminded me of the brunch spots in Manhattan (albeit more roomy - think of cafeteria or union sq cafe).  The employees here are all very nice.  We loved our waitress Vicky, such a sweetheart!   The food was good and fresh.  Although the award for the best french toast in town has already been taken (sorry guys - the nuts were a little burnt but the berries were a nice touch), they still have a very tasty eggs benedict (perfectly cooked Bello Bene).  I also liked the fact that fruit and hash browns/potatoes are included in your meal (although I couldn't tell from the menu).  Nice portion size for the price of the meal.  Unfortunately the fruit/melons were not sweet at all on the day we went, but the overall experience warrants a return visit (3.5).",

The staff is attentive and prompt; you can clearly see as you enter that the vibe is deliberately established by the management to attract dealmakers for power breakfasts and early meetings.       The food was quite good, and doled out  in generous helpings, but a highlight was  the potatoes O'Brien, which I would recommend you try, no matter what else you order.       At the right time of year, I'm sure the outside seating would also be amazing, but the fact that it was Arizona in August prevented me from sitting on the sidewalk.     The prices seemed about on par with an IHOP, but the ambience was much cooler, and the entire dining experience was more enjoyable.  (I'm not bagging on IHOP, just saying this place has a different feel- one that I enjoyed more.)

Also tried an omlette called the bird made with real fresh turkey and huge chunks of avocado. The potatoes had fresh cut onions and peppers and were a nice addition. They are very nice here and give you free refills on iced coffee during meal and after you leave also. One of the better breakfast spots in town if you get there early enough.",

    "text": "I want to start by saying Employee Whitney is a natural for customer service. It is rare for a restaurant veteran like me to find millennials who are capable of looking at your plate, cup or entree and determine what the customer needs. Whitney does this effortlessly. A Natural. If she is not a manager BC is missing the boat. Serving is all about serving.  Food: Having lived at Citiscape with an adjacent BC I am fully aware of all the menu items but it is the BC French Toast that makes me drive from Chandler to Scottsdale. Fresh berries and roasted pecans without that syrupy goo most places like to add. Decent enough coffee and an open airy atmosphere in Scottsdale add to top quality.  Service: Why 4 and not 5 stars. Three people were working the counter. Two seemed to be novice servers intent on smiling and looking good while Whitney took care of everyone at the counter whether it was her customer or not. With the NEW concept of walking into a restaurant and ordering at the register(hmmm, get the money before they eat) it is a telling trend that we are less inclined to deal with servers and tipping for sub par service( instead of training and retention of servers). Soon, if not already, service is rare in fast casual dining. There is an art to serving the general public. I've seen waiters put their kids thru medical school on their wages because it was a CRAFT and they took pride in what they did. Now, it's something to do between changing careers or schooling.  I'd love to talk to the dishwasher. If management is good that person would want to be the BEST dishwasher. No dirty plates on their watch. It's all about personal Pride and Integrity. All of these things lead to longevity in this business.",

    "text": "Rare does it happen that a restaurant experience is either so profoundly great or terrible that I am moved to write a review.  In this case, I am writing about the latter.  Breakfast Club is one of my favorite breakfast/brunch places in the entire Valley.  The food quality is usually outstanding for the price, the wait staff attractive, efficient, and accommodating, and my ability to get seated and served, prompt, despite the expected usual wait of 20 minutes or so on a weekend.  But this past weekend we ended up waiting nearly TWO HOURS to be seated!!!  As usual, the food quality was great, and the wait staff courteous and helpful, particularly Jessie, who handled the situation with aplomb, and even managed to get us moved to a large table inside that accommodated all 8 of us after we were forced to separate at two outside tables across the patio from each other.  Unfortunately, the manager seemed she was over her head in terms of her sense of logistics, inability to deal with a large weekend crowd, and quite frankly, common sense.  Our family gathered for a wedding over the weekend, and the 8 of us decided to have brunch before leaving town.  I called ahead to inquire about the wait and was advised that the wait for our group of 8 was approximately 45 minutes to an hour.  The hostess offered to place us on the wait list, which I accepted and received a confirming text shortly thereafter at 10:33 a.m.  Having worked in food service, I completely understand the challenges of seating a large party, thus our decision to call ahead.  We arrived at 11:05 a.m., and were told there would be about 15 minutes more to wait.  We repeatedly checked in with the hostess stand every 20 minutes, until TWELVE FIFTEEN!!!  At wits end, and short on time, my fiance pulled the manager aside and explained our frustration.  Finally, HE HAD TO SUGGEST breaking our party in half at two separate tables just to get some food on board before we got too \"HANGRY,\" which had long since passed for my 7 and 9 year old boys.  The manager looked surprised as if she hadn't thought of this solution.  Again, having spent years in the food service industry, I try to be super chill about problems beyond the control of the staff.  Even our servers commented that they had heard similar complaints from other patrons about ridiculous waits.  Unfortunately, the manager was so inept, my frustration really grew to the point I felt I had to write a negative YELP review.    At no time did she 1) apologize, 2) check on us once we were finally seated and served, 3) comp a single item on our check despite a nearly $200 bill (which we still tipped 20% on!), or 4) acknowledge us before we left at roughly 2:00 p.m. to apologize for the absolutely SHITTY job she did to attend to us.  It wasn't just ineptitude she displayed, but complete stupidity.  Who lacks common sense like that in the food service industry?  Despite my anger, I love the food and ambiance, and will likely be back.  I hope very strongly that this girl is fired, because the landmark brunch restaurant in Old Town is no place for such an abject rookie.  She has reflected poorly on the entire team and undoubtedly cost the wait staff a fortune in lost tips.  I'd also be pleased to receive some sort of coupon or gift certificate, but won't get my hopes up.  Regardless, you have a brand to protect, and the young, blonde, female manager who ran the show Sunday morning August 13, 2017 is a huge liability to you and the entire staff.  She needs you to help her find her next opportunity...maybe at Denny's.",

Next time I'm getting full smothered chorizo queso. It really made a normal breakfast burrito something special that you'd crave. The potatoes were really full of flavor, but a little greasy. The fruit on the side was actually good! It was the perfect ripeness which is unusual - usually it's more garnish for the plate.  My kids ordered pancakes (there is no kid's menu). Their pancakes and syrup were so tasty as well. I had more bites than I should have.  After breakfast came,  I decided to order a mocha. I was impressed worth how quickly it came out.  It is made with Ghirardelli according to their menu.  It was good!  Way better than the chalky mocha taste of starbucks!   Overall a great experience!

Service was great. Even though the restaurant was very busy, the servers and waitresses did a great job of taking our order, keeping our glasses filled, and getting us our food quickly.   The food was good, but not the most amazing breakfast I have ever had.   I would/will go again, but it will probably be a few months before I look at going back.",

The Dip sandwich meat was perfect and the flavor wonderful.  The huevos con masa had a rich spicy flavor that was very satisfying.

I said yes and that my wife was parking the car and getting the baby out. All she said was \"Ok\". 25 minuets later we were still waiting and even though my wife had been there with us for a while we weren't being seated.  I was watching party after party come in and get seated before us so I asked when we we would be seated and the hostess seemed really annoyed with me. She told me she couldn't seat everyone until our entire party was there. I wish I would have known!

We're in Old Town Scottsdale so it's totally understandable to wait for a table at a delicious restaurant (which I don't think people around here understand). I created my own omelet, and it was delicious! My boyfriend ordered the breakfast burrito and he loved it.

As a breakfast lover, I was impressed with their selection of Benedicts - I had the Filet Mignon my first time eating there. The 2nd time I went I hit paydirt by ordering the Huevos Rancheros. This is everything a breakfast should be - hearty with lots of texture, seasoning and just enough spice, with two perfectly cooked eggs on top. And the plate was huge. I seriously could eat that for breakfast every day. I also appreciated their freshly pressed juice, though there was too much of it. Offering a large and a small option (that is legitimately large or small) would be helpful. Other than that, a very pleasant meal, and I didn't have any problems with service as others have mentioned. We were served quickly, and allowed to linger the 2nd day when a flash storm came.

We ended up sitting for another 20 min before our full party was there to get seated. Another party after ya, got sat first, so due to that, we had to wait even longer for another big table to open up. At this point all of us were tired of being hungry and wanted to leave, but we stayed. Our server was so nice and really accommodated our full party. We ordered quickly as possible, and our food came out at a decent time. The food was okay, not anything crazy special. I got the steak and eggs, and the steak portion was small I thought.

What's also great is that the place is located center of old town Scottsdale which means you can hang in other shops while you wait for your turn.   We decided to order butter pancakes, BC Bagel which comes with tomato, avocado, and veggie cream cheese, and hash brown. The food quality was very fresh and tasted very good.

Got seated at the worst table in the place - right by the kitchen.  I should have said something, but I was hungry and thought the food would make up for it (it didn't).  Had a meat lovers omelet (something like that) and the sausage tasted like bologna.  Seriously - I kept thinking it was a bad joke and somebody put bologna in the omelet.  I picked out all of the nasty sausage -   This was my first and last trip to the Breakfast Club.  Way too many great restaurants in Scottsdale to waste time and money here.",

I ordered the fruit bowl and Scottish oatmeal, and both were delicious. I can't rave enough about the fruit-it was all fresh and delicious. Not to mention the little pineapple boat it comes in is adorable. It was served with a little yogurt and granola on the side which was a nice little dip to add. We also ordered a side of French toast (which was amazing-that challah bread was perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside) and the breakfast classic with eggs, bacon and toast. All the options were very reasonably priced and kept us full for hours. Our server was also friendly and the whole restaurant had a happy, relaxed vibe. Would definitely come back if we are in the area again.",

They have a weird system where there are cafe tables where you can sit and order coffee from the bar while you wait for a call to tell you a different table is now available for your meal. Meanwhile  their bar seating - which accommodates about 20- is a total free-for-all. Expect no mercy or sportsmanly concessions from those who will jump in front of you if you snooze when a customer at the bar vacates their seat.  Once you do get a table, you can expect an overstretched server but the food comes out quickly. Decent fried chicken sandwich served with not-super-crispy sweet potato fries for my husband. They made me a great customized breakfast with my favorite foods and get bonus points for offering non-pork breakfast meats! I try to be low carb at breakfast and this menu offers options.",

While I was fortunate to get seating right away (at the bar), there were several other couples that had to wait between 15-20 minutes for a seating area not at the bar, nor outside (there is water mist provided outside).   Saturdays are raucous with locals and tourists alike, so try to get here early. Mimosas are served here all day long, yet I'm not certain about when beer, wine & spirits start to be served. Friendly & attentive staff throughout. The Tinga Chicken Frittata omellette ($11) is completely on point here, and hard to mess up! With the avocado, the blend of light seasoning and vegetables fall effortlessly down your esophagus. Just pure bliss. The Cold Brew Nitro? Absolutely outstanding. Even better are the prices. For Scottsdale? Very, very reasonable.   The one annoying thing at the Breakfast Club is the parking. Good luck. Very tight, extremely limited. Although there is a restaurant next door that seems to open late, why take the chance of getting towed? I'd park further down the street, if necessary.   Altogether, this is on par with Lolo's Waffles for Scottsdale breakfast options. And like Lolo's, it is loud, loud, LOUD up in here!",

It was a long wait (which was normal I guess) but the hostesses were not very nice and neither was our waitress. All of the staff seemed a little stuck up. The breakfast menu was pretty standard and a little overpriced. The biscuits and gravy were $11 and it was not big at all. Usually for that amount of b&g it's only $7/8 at other places. All of the food my  table got was only luke warm, which was a major downer.  Also, it was NFL Sunday and they had a good amount of tvs inside. Only problem was, there were two games on tv and they had infomercials and news on every tv except one. It just seems like this place could be better if they did some things different and tried to be better then average.",

After successfully scanning previous reviews, I decided to partake of a Tex-Mex breakfast experience in Scottsdale AZ. Boy was I disappointed. In fact, in the defense of the chefs, perhaps certain delicacies are best suited for an acquired taste. My primary complaint is not food but service. Well, partial. My waitress was warm and helpful. However, some form of kitchen management returned a meal that was not to my liking and basically said, \"deal with it\". Her exact words were..\"we take great pride in our food\"....and \"I won't take this off your tab\"...and \"the menu states the ingredients\". Ummmm. First, I have a doctorate. I can read. Secondly, I never asked for a free meal. I just returned it and asked for something else. I walked in with 850.00 of pocket change but was treated like a vagabond. Guess what lady, I'm also contacting Fodors. Any service industry business must be first concerned with the satisfaction of your customers. They can make or break you. Perhaps you will learn.  Even after this poor manager service experience, I left my waitress Christie a 50.00 tip. Never judge a book by its cover!!!!",

My disappointment lies with the apparent lack of skill in the kitchen. I ordered a custom omelette with spinach and bacon. Sounds simple and tasty, right? Well, they ruined it. There was NO seasoning at all. I NEVER add salt to meals, but had to to make it at all palatable. The hash was also bland.   Our waitress seemed especially dim. I wonder if they primarily hire girls who couldn't get into college. I didn't see a single male employee and no female employee looked to be older than 25.   There were two tables of LOUD frat boys behind us, which didn't improve the experience at all.   It seems like the place is overrun with inexperienced people. They turn over tables quickly, but I definitely won't return.",

I got the french dip + mushrooms and swiss and a coffee to help with my hangover.  The sweet potato fries could have standed to be crunchier, but the flavor was there and the sandwich was quite tasty.  Normally at a place with a name such as this I would only stick to breakfast - but when one is hung over, you must go with your gut instinct, and I'm glad I did.  Traffic / parking was a mess, but I suppose that's to be expected on a weekend with such beautiful weather.  Overall, I dig this place and will likely be back.",

It's a relatively busy place, especially on a weekend morning, so even though it's been around for a while, I hadn't decided to check it out until recently. And I'm glad I did. Definitely expect to wait, but if you've got good company, you can hang out in their waiting area - the coffee bar - and get yourself some drinks to start with and just chit chat.  The atmosphere is lively but relaxing; easy to zone out and be in your own little universe. My friend and I ordered two different dishes we were interested in trying and split them - a challah french toast dish and an eggs benedict dish. Both were amazing! We were not disappointed. Though probably not my most favorite french toast in all my life time (I love challah french toast, only way to go), it was quite memorable and something that would encourage me to return so that I can try some of their other items; though knowing me I always seem to go back to what is tried and True.  Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed. Service was fast and friendly, so even though you'll most likely have to wait for a table, it's worth it.",

It was a spring training baseball day, with the Giants playing just around the corner apparently (we were going to an afternoon game too,but at a different stadium, thus we didn't know about this closer stadium-Giants).  Anyway - had to wait about 45 minutes. That was ok, because it gave us a chance to walk around some of the cute, unique shops in Olde Town!    Got seated out on the patio (overlooking the street - so I just pretended we overlooked the ocean or something beautiful like that, ha).  Good server, fast service.  AMAZING fresh squeezed grapefruit juice for me ($7 for a large - wow), and... the BEST PART OF THE MEAL - portabello mushroom eggs benedict in the most delicious sauce EVER!!!!!!!!!!! SO SO SO wonderful!  Daughter's chocolate chip pancakes were great, and hubby and kids had normal breakfast stuff (eggs, bacon, etc) and loved it too.  So glad one of hubby's friends had told us about this place.  It's on our list of places to go to again next time we are in Scottsdale!  Go there... you won't be sorry.",

Was advised there's no service at these tables. They had us go to the counter and order carry out. Ok, we did and explained we would be eating there. So, instead of bringing out food out on plates. Everything was packed in individual plastic containers. Between, the omelettes, toast, fruit, etc we had 6 containers in two plastic bags for over $38 w/o tip. The restaurant was very nice and clean. For 8am on a Monday morning they weren't packed. Kind of surprised they wouldn't have gone out of their way a bit.  I won't be going back.",

    "text": "The Breakfast Club? Wasn't that the old movie from the 80's where a group of delinquents found that they were deeper than just their surface looks? Well, unfortunately, at this Breakfast Club- it is all superficial.   I thought with the Old Town location that this would be a good breakfast choice. And given the fact that there were people standing outside to get in at 9:15am - that is also usually a signal that a place has a following. So imagine my surprise when the food didn't live up to my expectations.   If this review was only for Eli- the super fast, all seeing, all knowing, ever patient barrista who also minded the counter superhero, this would be a 5 star review for sure. Here's a guy who is pleasant, quick, multitasks and puts up with the most inane requests from people, all with a smile on his face.   I sat at his counter, ordered up an espresso (perfectly made) and some breakfast. The breakfast came out post haste! I mean- I had barely cracked the binding on my book when placed in front of me was huge plate with two Eggs Benedict, a pile of melon and pineapple and breakfast potatoes with pepper and onions.   But it was here that my dream morning came to an abrupt halt. While the eggs were perfectly poached, the hollandaise sauce was almost orange- not the golden buttery color associated with real hollandaise. And it was full of red pepper. If I wanted my eggs spicy- I would have ordered them that way. I wished my Eggs Benedict had come looking like the picture that is posted on Yelp. And those potatoes? Eh. Not so good.   The people next to me ordered pancakes and bacon and had there been a contest- those would have been the big winner, for sure!   Breakfast and an espresso ran about $18. There is plenty of parking in the lot or on the street. If you go- and want stellar service- sit at the coffee bar and have Eli take care of you.   Great service from Eli. Friendly and accommodating host staff. But the food? I felt for a moment that I was in detention at the Breakfast Club. And that alone will have me looking elsewhere for my favorite meal of the day.",

    "text": "I came in from NYC this weekend to experience Scottsdale and was taken to The Breakfast Club by a friend who lives in the area. I can honestly say much of my experience here can be best summed up by the word / sound \"Meh\"   I was quoted a wait time of around 10 mins but it ended up being closed to 30 mins. The waitress was ok but not overly attentive. The coffee was alright. I ordered the Huevos rancheros which was actually pretty good. I order this dish whenever I can and this was a great authentic green chili version. I thought the pork was top notch but the egg was entirely too small for the size of the dish. Having enough egg to add to every bite is what makes the dish perfection and this fell a bit short.  All and all I think you can easilly get a better breakfast at over easy but it's not in downtown scottsdale. The location was very cool and gave me a nice feel for the city. Bottom-line not the worst place to get breakfast but you could do better.",

We sat outside on the patio, and it was fun people watching and looking at the cars going by. I had a mimosa, which was a bit pricey at $10, but it was in a huge class and was very tasty. My dining companion had a Bloody Mary--also $10 for the big size--which he enjoyed. The coffee was very nice as well. Following the recommendation of my server, I chose the Cinnamon Challah French Toast. It was SO good! Unlike some breakfast places, where you only get a minimal dusting of toppings on your french toast, my plate was loaded up with candied nuts and blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries. It was well worth the $11 because it was a HUGE serving. I think it came with 3 giant pieces of bread. The service was really great, friendly, and attentive. I can't wait to check this place out again. There are lots of other items that sound tasty, and they also serve lunch.",

By far the most impressive item was the jalapeno biscuits and gravy with fontina cheese. We got an order for the table to share, and they didn't last long!   There is typically quite a wait at the door, and they don't serve alcohol, so don't count on bloody's or mimosas. Don't let that discourage you, though.

    "text": "When you say Breakfast Club, I say awesome '80s flick full of detention and dancing through hallways -- but let's save that gnarly story for another day.   Many a morning, I'll pass The Breakfast Club and there's a line out the door like bacon's going out of style. At first, I wondered what it was all about. Then I ate there and have since been back over and over and over again. It's pretty good! Worth the wait? I'm going with a solid...heck ya if you have the time to spare.   I'm an avocado snob and you can get a good selection of the buttery green goodness in any omelet or egg dish you choose...or if you just want it on the side to accompany your waffles. I love the omelet selection with the grilled veggies and salty potatoes. The pancakes are large and in charge. Their coffee is roasted like the best of them. Plus they have the option for community dining seats which can sometimes be fun and a cool way to meet new people (but they also have normal solo dining as well).   The only main deterrent against making The Breakfast Club my go-to breakfast all the time is the wait, but I've learned that I need to go at off-times in order to avoid the line. The main hours of craziness are around 8:00-10:30 AM on the weekends -- pretty much the prime time breakfast hours. But, if you could.. let's say ... wake up a tad earlier (eek!) or make it brunch instead of breakfast, then you might avoid the lines. Otherwise, just sit tight and wait for the table. You might also try to find an excuse to have a breakfast meeting during the weekday there. It's a lot less crowded on the weekdays. Regardless, I think the wait is pretty much worth it.  You can also grab a coffee to go while you wait in case you're a caffeine addict like me (even though Diet Coke is my drug of choice) and you need your fix.",

I forgot to say iced on my dirty chai and told my server before I got my drink. She said they would remake it although I just asked for a glass of ice. The drinks were the best part, I got the Turkey Benedict my husband got their eyes, bacon and toast. Most of their breakfasts are made with 4 eggs which is a lot in my opinion. My poached eggs were rubbery and my husbands over medium eggs were runny. Cost wise, I struggle with paying $11 for a basic Benedict and most items were over $10. Last week we did brunch right across the street at the Montauk. I recommend going there, their steak and egg sandwich was really good and big enough to share. We will stop into the BC for coffee drinks if we are in the area but I don't see myself making the trip over to Scottsdale for BC. I gave three stars for our service, the drinks and how my server handled my hot versus iced coffee situation. Also I am a yogi and I wear yoga pants all the time, but not sure about them being used as a uniform. Again just my opinion.",

If you want a conveniently located brunch place with good food, and you don't mind a wait, check this place out...just don't expect bubbly servers.

He ordered something massive and great looking. I ordered the \"Grilled Cheese\"...a total euphemism since it includes bacon, hash browns and eggs in addition to cheese on sourdough. Our server suggested I add avocado and tomato to it...which I did. Simply awesome.   Our server, Victoria (a/k/a 'Barista1') was awesome as well. She was attentive and proactive.

    "text": "Great experience, used the Join wait list from yelp and it worked. The hostess was friendly upon arrival and directed us to where we could order very good coffee at the counter. We were seated in few minutes and the server was very a professional. The food was very good. The blue corn meal pancake was the superb. The omelet  we ordered came with a spear of fresh fruit which were well portioned slices of pineapple, honey dew and cantaloupe. The potatoes were sauteed in peppers and onions with just enough oil. We loved our server and gave her 25% tip. This  was a five star breakfast.",

I ordered a Breakfast Bowl which was apparently pork with chile verde sauce on top of an egg scramble.  It was okay but nothing special.  I think that I could do better making something like that at home.  I also had a Bloody Mary.  I got what tasted like a Virgin Mary.  Very light pour of vodka.  I opted not to complain to my waiter because I didn't want the hassle.  I won't be back on my own accord but if I'm with a group of friends who would want to go,  I wouldn't object.  I won't be ordering the Breakfast Bowl or a Bloody Mary.",

If you can manage to get in without too much of a wait, you will most likely have an exceptional experience.  Great food, awesome vibrant servers, quick turnaround on orders and their Bloody Mary's are the bomb. On the way out the door, our server overheard us talking about hiking Camelback, so she brought us all complimentary bottled waters for the hike.  Great overall experience.",

Then there is the eggs. Even the most humble of restaurants is able to cook eggs over-medium properly. These were very sloppy with the whites not even cooked. I sent them back but meanwhile my breakfast mates were about done. The potatoes Obrien were just ok but not my favorite type of breakfast potatoes.  Service was fine but the waitress a little surprised that I would send something back. Perhaps the majority of diners don't know any better?",

Second, the food was good, it could've been better if my waitress wasn't such a rude person. She drops my food off and walks away. No smile, no hello, nothing. I watch as she interacts with every other customer, she chats away and seems to have a grand old time. Meanwhile she makes no attempt at a conversation.   Third, drops off the check, I pay, she brings it back, still no conversation. It felt like I was given the bums rush. Such a shitty experience, maybe the hostess should be the waitress, she definitely has the people skills for it. Also I'm glad your location is next to PHX start up hub... This will cause for some interesting business if you continue to hire shitty waitress.",

How else would 4 types of meat, hash browns, chili, cheese, and 4 eggs turn out? Greasy, sloppy mess, right? You would think..but against all odds, what I got was a NON-greasy, crispy hashbrown topped, well-balanced, delicious breakfast bowl. I still have no idea how they did it.

Which was amazing and my hubby had the lean green omelette that came with hashbrowns and fruit. The only down fall is my french toast only came with french toast. I had to order eggs and bacon on the side. Their coffee is outstanding and i am a hard critic when it comes to my iced chai and they were spot on. Our waitress Victoria is incredible. Even though they were busy she still came by at the right times to check on us. Even gave us some to go coffee before we left  i would highly recommended  this place if you are out in the scottsdale area. Parking is a pain but well worth it. Thanks Victoria!!! We will be by to see you again.",

There is not one item on there menu that you can go wrong with if you are trying to tame that morning hangover.  This goes very well with the best Bloody Mary's in town, Spicy!    Staff is very attentive and never makes you wait for something you need.  If something is out of your liking, they will correct it in a heart beat.  Expect a wait if you are here during snowbird season and spring training.  Otherwise, come in around noon or early in the morning and you will be treated to a great food experience.",

The outdoor seating is very nice, but when the sun is hot, it can be uncomfortable as the shade is a little awkward. Anyway, the food: the fresh squeezed orange juice was really good. I ordered the blueberry pancakes, but they simply didn't stack up (ha ha) to the quality of pancakes I get at other breakfast restaurants. They were on the dry side and a bit too bready. Needed to be drowned in syrup to improve. They also could have used more blueberries. Based on the pancakes I received, I'd say there are better places to get breakfast. The Breakfast Club looks and feels more upscale (and has prices to match), but you're better off with your cheap, diner-style breakfast.",

Second -- I love that they have a coffee bar, where you can wait for your table with a latte.  Third-- It's a nice spacious place with patio seating right off of N.

We grabbed some coffee, from the barista who was rude,and waited for 55 minutes. When we got called for our table they sat us at a large table on one side and we expected that another party would sit on the other side. The hostess put a large party on the other side of the table so there was not even one chair in between us and we were uncomfortably next to them. And to top it off, the waitress ignored us and went to them first not even acknowledging us. Thank you for the complete waste of time.",

First of all, when you drive down Scottsdale Road, you can see the lines forming outside and you would think that the Rolling Stones were in concert inside performing!!  Well, when I certainly can't get no satisfaction when it came to the food.  First of all, the service was a little frantic.  There were a ton of annoying \"I think I am cool\" people who were obviously hungover from \"clubbing\" in the Scottsdale scene the night before and all wearing sunglasses and tried to look like Paris Hilton and Nick Lashay.  Oh,  well.  As for the food, I ordered the huevos rancheros.  My friend told me that it looked like somebody vomited in a large tortilla!!  I had to agree, he was right.  The eggs were undercooked and the whites were very runny!  I was DISGUSTED!!  My friend ordered a pancake and that looked ok.  Don't order the orange juice here, they will charge you and ARM & A LEG!  So, bottom line...if you like long lines and enjoy watching the Scottsdale party girls and guys nurse their hangovers as they text and show off their sunglasses and then eat, this is the place for you.  If you want a good ol' fashion American breakfast, this place may not be for you.  Go to Denny's instead!  :)",

I ordered an omelette and it was absolutely scrumptious.  And their menu had quite a selection.  And I felt like I was living in a bustling, major city... which, after living in NYC and Philly, felt just like home to me!  I would definitely go back.  Though, I do have two complaints.  The wait is a bit long, but I thought it was worth it.  And the second is that our waitress was rude.  She kept on giving us snide looks when we didn't order right away (my girlfriend and I were catching up) and even didn't give us more water at the end of our meal to make sure we left in a speedy manner.  So, if you are looking to eat a leisurely brunch, you might want to consider another place.  But, sincerely, I would recommend the food here.",

After waiting 25 minutes or so which wasn't so bad outside on an early spring morning (summer might be a different story) we were sat inside, had a super nice server and a tough time deciding what to get due to the extensive menu. They definitely put their own spin on traditional breakfasts here which I appreciated and seems to set them apart from most places. My friend ordered the huevos rancheros which had juicy beef mixed in. My breakfast burrito was huge and they gave me the option to have it smothered in chile verde sauce and I happily accepted. My only wish was that they put a little more chorizo in the burrito itself. Otherwise it was fantastic. Also, the food came about 5 minutes after we ordered. This restaurant doesn't mess around and is a great place to dine alone, with a friend or your whole family.",

We eat here every time we come to Scottsdale and have always enjoyed our meals along with the service, which is very professional, friendly and quick. And for those of you who find it more like breakfasting in Silicon Valley here, I have to wonder if you get out much? It's like that everywhere you go in Scottsdale (boobs and blondes) every which way you turn!  But, anyway, great bacon to be had here, and according to my 13 year old son, the chocolate chip pancakes aren't bad, either! My husband really likes the omelettes here, and my youngest son loves the scrambled eggs. The only draw back is the wait, and not so much the wait itself, but rather where you'll most likely end up waiting, because it does get busy here and there isn't a lot of waiting space inside, and let's face it, it is Scottsdale, so in the summertime, it does get pretty hot outside, and waiting outside in the heat can be a little much for some. But other than that, we really, really like this place. :)",

It was a weekday and so, while it was still busy, we didn't have to wait to be seated. The food was good, but slightly over-priced. My biggest problem with the restaurant - the service. They were slow to deliver our drinks and food, yet once our food came, they were swarming around like bees every five minutes to take our plates so we could get out of there. I felt like they didn't care at all for the fact that I was having a nice morning with a good friend but instead wanted us to pay and leave. After we had been there for just over an hour and fifteen minutes, out waitress actually told us to leave the table and finish our conversation outside so they could seat other customers. We were mortified. I have NEVER been asked to leave a restaurant in my life. Needless to say, they didn't win a loyal customer with me.",

Definitely hearty and kept me full until happy hour (more on that later).  The gravy was a little watered down to my liking, but the jalapeno flavor in the biscuit was subtle, but it was there when you bit into it.  Be prepared for a wait on the weekends, but you will be glad you did.

My sister had a cup of oatmeal and the quick start. I also had a glass of fresh orange juice which was perfect, without pulp!

They had Irish Breakfast and it was served as properly as loose tea...very excited to see that.  I also had the breakfast burrito which has egg, chorizo and pepper jack cheese and smothered with chorizo queso.  So good and filling.  It also comes with lettuce and beans which I told them to hold.  The burrito also comes with slices of fresh fruit (cantaloupe, pineapple and watermelon) and hash browns.",

The food, the service, the environment ~~~ All incredible.  I had the heuvos rancheros and my buddy had the heuvos con masa.  We both got a side of applewood bacon (done your way) and jalapeno biscuits.  The portions were large and in charge, but so good that I couldn't put my fork down.  The jalapeno biscuits were not spicy, but the flavor of the pepper did come through well.  I did have to spice up my huevos a bit, but that's because I'm addicted to hot sauce.  Next time I'm in town, I HAVE to try their mimosas....the waitress made at least 50 while we were there (we sat at the bar).    The Breakfast Club is a must!!",

If I had to sum up the Breakfast Club in one word, it'd be \"meh.\" And if you don't consider \"meh\" to be a word, perhaps sampling the fare here would change your mind.   The service is consistently so-so. A solid 5 out of 10. My order has in some way been messed up more often than not, and it always takes a lot longer than you'd expect for a breakfast place. There's not really any ambience to speak of. An awkward side patio overlooking busy Scottsdale Road is perhaps their best feature.   Finally for the food. Although nothing has ever been terrible, I've also never sampled anything to write home about. And for the average plate being $9-$11, shouldn't it be well above average?? The answer is yes. Don't be duped by Scottsdale's higher price tag for, well, everything...Higher price should still equal better quality period!!  My final frustration is with their limited options for dietary modifications. I am vegetarian and I recently dined with a friend who is gluten free. I had to severely reduce my order to fit into the vegetarian requirements (they don't even have vegetarian black beans or any of their speciality sauces such as queso or green chili that don't have meat in them!!). No gluten free bread or pancake options...yet this is the \"breakfast club\"...enough people are vegetarian and/or gluten free in this day and age...shouldn't Breakfast Club get with the times??",

Right off the bat, I was bothered by two things:  first, my knife had some caked-on gunk on it, and second, our waitress brought us each water with lemon.  I suppose most people would not be bothered by that, but I have an aversion, and likely an allergy, to citrus.  I always ask for my water or iced tea without lemon.  I ordered bacon and eggs, over medium.  My daughter ordered ham and eggs, over medium.  Both her eggs and mine were overdone (brown & crispy) on the outside, runny on the inside.  Neither of us liked the fact that the fruit was on the same plate, because the egg yolks (and undercooked whites) ran into the fruit.  Up until we ate here, I never imagined that anybody could mess up breakfast.  Needless to say, we were extremely disappointed with The Breakfast Club.",

THE FOOD: Biscuits and Gravy. The biscuits are listed as jalapeno, but there was no jalapeno flavor at all. The gravy was decent. The roasted potatoes were not cooked enough and were too raw to cut with a fork.  The Benedict with crab. Obviously canned crab meat, and the hollandaise had a day-glo orange look to it, almost as if it had been made with Tang. The hollandaise flavor was off as well. And again, the same with the potatoes.  Belgian waffle. Decent. It's kind of hard to screw up a waffle.   SERVICE: The service was good. Attentive without being annoying.  It is definitely a place where the annoying of Scottsdale seem to flock to. I was expecting to see cameras come in to film an episode of Real Housewives of Scottsdale.  We won't be back.",

I went the healthy route this morning and went with the Quick Start Conscious. 4 egg whites, broccoli, tomato, fruit and cottage cheese. Phenomenal for a healthy breakfast out.   Breakfast club also brews a pretty solid cup of coffee that gives me a pretty good buzz for only having two cups.  The only real negative is the outside seating. It seemed good in theory on a cool day in Scottsdale with temperatures only in the seventies. However, being right on Scottsdale Road, it was hard to hear the people I was eating with because of all the passing traffic. I'd advise that anyone dining here eat inside (where it unfortunately can also be a little loud since the place is always busy).",

Under the awnings outside,  you see people waiting in line, lounging around, waiting for a table.  Wow, with these reviews and that line, the food must be great!  You give the friendly waitress your name and wait.  It's old town, so the wait is pleasurable; with your estimated wait time, you can walk around, enjoy the sights and gorgeous waterfront area, and meander back, grab a drink...in all honesty, the wait, even at an hour, goes well because there is enough to see and do.  Once you get inside you begin to realize that this place isn't that special.   Tables and chairs in a casual area.  Denny's has more comfortable benches, those these natural tree table tops look much cooler.  Your waitress is super friendly and you love the quick service, after you figure out that the girl in the VS sweatpants really does work there and will be serving your food.  The glittery PINK pants make it easy to find her when you want a refill anyway, although she's super fast and never leaves you with an empty glass.  The menu has many options, so perhaps you should give other options a try.  If you go with the traditional eggs, meat, toast, you won't get anything special.  In fact, your food at home probably tastes better, except you wouldn't put such pretty slices of fruit arranged just so  on your own plate at home.  The omelette is good, but seriously, were you that lazy that you preferred to wait for an hour and spent $6 for a basic nothing-special concoction?  When the bill comes, you're happy that the damage isn't bad and you can walk over to Nordstrom guilt free... but next time you're hungry in the morning after a run through old town, perhaps you'll just wait for Nordstrom to open and have one of their amazing meals instead.",

We thought about getting more potatoes since it was the only decent thing on the plate but we decided not to stay there any longer. The girls were standing around talking while the barista was busting his butt getting out drinks, to go orders, refills, and clearing dishes. I wish they were wearing name tags so I could at least give credit where it's due (and point out who obviously needs improvement let's just call her dark haired girl in lulu lemon).

I could have split this with three people and still been full. The whole menu looked awesome, including the drinks like fresh squeezed juice and hot bevvies from their coffee bar. I just got a regular coffee, and refills were brought promptly by our server.  Lindsey F. and I hung out on the sidewalk patio, which was the way to go on a sunny morning. It was busy for a Wednesday I thought, and it was pretty loud inside. There was a short wait for an outdoor table, but they had a couple of their \"community seating\" spots available when I came in. That's where you sit with another group at the same table. They won't seat you until your whole party is on the premises either, so make sure you don't have late-comers on a busy weekend morning. I'm sure this place gets packed.",

They have amazing fresh juices, I enjoyed the pineapple juice. $4.00 gets you a 'small' but it's a fairly large size. I has the BC bagel, (everything bagel that was perfectly toasted and had avocado, tomato and a nice house cream spread), yummy.",

This monster was BOMB. Mr. Muscle ordered a breakfast burrito bowl or something like that. Verde, hash browns, eggs, it was delicious too. These are hardy meals that actually packed a great flavor. Pancakes were very good - had some flavor and chew to them. Excellent place for breakfast - highly recommend. 2 meals, coffee, milk and side of pancakes about $27.  Worth it. Service was great. Also serve all kinds of fancy smoothies, coffees and alcohol based breakfast cocktails.",

The hubs had a breakfast burrito one morning and a Mexican scramble the next - both awesome (and HUGE). I opted for my usual classic egg breakfast and then splurged for banana pancakes the next day. By far, some of the best pancakes that I have had (shhh...don't tell my mom).  I loved the decor of this place, and with all the windows & high ceilings it's really bright and airy. Plus with their tasty coffee (which they offer to fill up for you to go) it's a great start to your day.  The only thing I would say that they lacked is effective hostesses, (which is common) and the service was a little slow when it came time to pay the bill. Other than that absolutely no complaints!",

My breakfast was huge and tasted okay but nothing more than that... I had the Bello Bene: Portabella mushrooms, Bordelaise & Hollandaise.    They also serve Bloody mary's and mimosa's to go with your Breakfast.   My only advise.....Big portions so be hungry and be ready to wait to be seated if you are planning to visit this place over the weekends.",

They accommodated our entire family of six adults and one child at one long group of tables very well.  We got there first and had to wait for the rest of the gang which was fine as we watched food go past us and had our coffee and juice.  This place does fill up rapidly so either get there early or after the crowds have come and gone.  The service was good as was the food.  As it was family we all took bites of each others meals of hash browns, shroom omelet, and a nice salmon Benedict ($14.00).  Wish we had ordered the french toast because it did look very good.    There were no complaints from anyone at our table about food or service and for our entire party the bill was $68.00 which was for food and drinks.  The decor is a bit retro but nice and the view of Scottsdale while you nom is great...especially if you are from someplace that doesn't have mountains and palm trees.",

My friend put our name in just before 9:50am and was told there would be about a 20 minute wait - sure, no problem.  After about 35 minutes, we asked what was happening and the hostess had somehow lost our name (even though my friend saw her write it down).  Somehow, it took almost another 10 minutes to seat us after that (but at least we were waiting inside), and then the server took ages to appear at the table.  Once our server took the order (I may have barked that we were in a hurry, irritated after waiting at the table with no greeting), the food came out quickly and exactly like we ordered it.  My friend and I each had an omelet, and they were both fresh and light and cooked perfectly.    When the bill came, they'd knocked $5 off the check for our trouble.  That was nice of them, but, frankly, they didn't seem at all sorry (thought they said the words).  I doubt we'll be back.",

They take your phone number and send you a text when your table is ready. But be forewarned that they will not seat you until your entire party is there!  I had the Burrito Bowl and it was really good. Crispy hashed browns on the bottom, topped with eggs scrambled with peppers, onions, and a variety of meats. What pushes the dish from good to great is the pork green chili that they put on top of the eggs! It has big chunks of tender pork in a spicy green chili sauce,  it's really flavorful and just spicy enough.   My friend had the Lean & Green omelet and subbed feta for the swiss with no problem, she said it was really good, especially for a healthy breakfast. It was served with fruit and potatoes. Our waitress was helpful and friendly and gave me a coffee to go!",

Make sure to specify you want the BC French toast or you'll get the plain French toast which is sad since you will miss out on all the yumminess that come with the BC version. The pork green chili was good, a bit heavy but worth trying if you like a lot of flavor.  The service was a bit slow for not being packed. I think that was more a kitchen issue not a server one.

We really expected great things considering how long of a wait there was (tip: call ahead and they'll put you on the list). I found the hostess and our waitress to clearly be stressed and it came across as very unfriendly and borderline rude. When seated, our waitress forgot our drink order 15 minutes after taking it and had to come back to ask what it was. We ordered two coffees and an OJ. Not complicated. The coffee was some of the worst I've ever had. Either it was badly burned or just very cheap. The food was pretty bland...I'd call it okay at best. After the food came out, our waitress never asked how it was, if we wanted anything else or brought water refills despite empty glasses for all of us.

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that the food is good here. It was the service that our group received today that was not so good.  My company often orders breakfast to go from the Breakfast Club for store meetings. For this meeting we decided we should have an offsite meeting and go to the restaurant. We met this morning (Sunday) at 8:30am. We had a party of four total and my coworker and I were the first to show. The restaurant was busy but we were seated right away. The hostess sat us at a long table that was more of an 8 top rather than a 4 top, which I didn't understand because there were many booths open. Once the rest of our group arrived a few minutes later we were given maybe two to three minutes to look over the menu and the waitress seemed irritated that we weren't  ready to order yet. She seemed like she was in a constant rush the entire time.  I ordered the jalapeno biscuits and gravy which were amazing. The flavor of the gravy is great and it is also served with potatoes o brien which were also delicious. My group all finished their food rather quickly because we felt as though we were being rushed through our meal because our waitress constantly was hovering the table asking if we needed anything (in a pestering way not a helpful way). After our plates were cleared I had planned to do a quick team building exercise that would maybe take an extra 15 to 20 minutes max. I do understand that the restaurant was busy but I do not appreciate being rushed out while many other families were enjoying their meals for much longer than we planned to be here. Eventually the waitress came over and stated that she would be seating a party next to us (we were sitting on a bench style seat) which I had no problem with but it was the way in which we were approached that I did not appreciate. I just feel like the entire meal was extremely rushed and that made the experience not enjoyable for our whole team. If I were to plan a breakfast business meeting again anytime soon, I would not bring my business back to the Breakfast Club.  It is unfortunate because the food is great. I guess it's to go orders only from here on out.",

Me and my 2 girls just happen to be in town for the Taylor Swift concert.    On our last day, and after checking out of our hotel down the street, we wanted to eat somewhere in the area.  After driving around a bit the night before, we chose The Breakfast Club as our dining choice the next morning.  We did not make a bad decision!!  Our visit was on August 19, 2015 at about 11:30 am.  We sat at table 44.  We arrived to the restaurant and was promptly greeted by the hostess.  I didn't catch her name, but she was very kind, asked how many in our party, and escorted us to our table which was located next to the window with a nice view of Scottsdale Road.  Big surprise there was no wait when we got there....Nice!!  Sitting at our table I glanced around the room and was very impressed how nice the restaurant is.  It's very open, inviting, properly lit, energetic, and not a single ugly person working in the front of house!  Don't get me wrong, I am all about enjoying the beauty in life, but this place takes it seriously.  The wait staff are all females (except for the bartenders) who wear either leggings or yoga pants, Nike tennis shoes, and the restaurant shirt and apron.  Even the male bartenders were attractive, which made me feel a bit inadequate!  Totally kidding!  Anyway, back to the review!    A few minutes later we were greeted by our adorable waitress Shannon.  She was very polite, took our drink order (1 chocolate milk, and 2 lemonades) and even took the time to answer my silly questions about the restaurant.  Keep in mind I had two very tired teenagers with me, and Shannon was very patient, even though I know she had a busy section.  We placed our orders after asking about a few items on the menu.  The girls both chose the Banana French Toast, a side of bacon, and a side of 2 eggs.  I choose the Quick Start Breakfast which consisted of 4 eggs, potatoes O'Brian, a slice of 9 grain wheat, crispy bacon, and a fruit skewer.  I know...seems like a lot of food, and it was for the price of only $8.75.  That's a hell of a deal!!  Tasted amazing too!  Also, I tried the girls' French Toast and it was probably the best I have eaten in a long time.  Amazing quality goes into the presentation of their dishes!  Shannon came back regularly to check on us, offered necessary refills, and cleared soiled dishes when we were done with them.  This places deserves a higher rating than 5 stars, if it were possible.  Definitely coming back to eat again when I make it back to town!!  Great job again Shannon!  You are adorable!",

Get the app to cut the wait for a table! My wife and I have walk here each morning for 5 consecutive days to eat, there is that many truly great choices here. Go to's are huevos con masa, and the breakfast grilled cheese. All the servers are extremely friendly and joyful to have you order off menu.... And they get it right!",

Actually it was a great opportunity to meet Larry W from CA/TX as he drove through on his way back home. COOL!  We arrived on a Saturday around Noonish and the place was super packed. They had a pretty good wait list and everyone outside looked very hungry.  Ordered the Border Bowl and a giant glass of freshly squeezed OJ. Other members went with the Whole Hog plate, Eggs Benedict, a Caesar Chicken Wrap and some type of Veggie Dish.  Everything was delicious and the portions were very large. The fresh squeezed OJ was definitely good and something I've not had in a long time. The Bloody Marys looked fantastic and were giant.  We all had a great time visiting and the service was excellent. The menu has something for everyone and this would be a place that I'd bring the family back for a special occasion.  The parking can be a little tricky and it is mostly behind the building. Just take you time and be careful driving in this part of town. The locals are pretty crazy and some of the streets nearby go around in circles. Dang shopping malls.  See ya there next time and remember you can eat breakfast at any time of the day. There is no real written rule. ORDER UP!  4 STARS",

I went on the advice of a woman working at the local PetSmart, where my dog was enjoying Doggy Daycamp, greatly appreciating the recommendation.  Both days I ordered a version of their Eggs Benedict.  The first day I ordered their Bello Bene, which is a superb marinated portabello mushroom with eggs,  hollandaise, and bordelaise sauce, which was the stuff of dreams.  The second day I had an excellent Benedict, aka \"Traditional Bene.\"  The iced lattes I ordered with the meals were also perfect.  The service, for the most part, was friendly and efficient.  If I lived in the area, I would gladly be a regular.  That's the single highest compliment I can pay any establishment.",

She took our order out of obligation and never came back to check on the table after the food reached us, yet some of our party of 6 still tipped over 25% of their bill. Before leaving, the waitress literally called out one of the cash tippers because her tip wasn't what the waitress wanted and told the rest of us to tip her more because she \"isn't working for free!\" I have never had an experience like this. The food and portion sizes were great, but the service totally negated that aspect.

What got me though was what I assumed to be their manager... She was wearing a floral top instead of the BC clothing, longer brown hair. It seems she spent the whole time goofing off with the staff, taking photos on her phone and not really paying attention to the restaurant. As someone who works in the restaurant business I found this to be really unprofessional.

I got The Bird, a heavenly two egg omelet STUFFED (and they do mean STUFFED these are BIG!) with turkey, avocado, mushrooms and some kind of creamy perfection of a cheese.  I wasn't hungry again until diner after eating this.  The orange juice is good, but my husband wasn't thrilled with the coffee (he did give an approving nod to the large cream pitchers on the tables which prevented him having to go through his usual \"more cream please\" routine).  The other plus point for The Breakfast Club besides the outdoor seating (a little close to a busy street  and I didn't notice any misters on those July mornings, but at least its available) is that they serve my favorite McIlhenny Co chipotle tabasco sauce, the icing on the cake, or rather the hot sauce on the omelet as it were.",

It's located right on the north end of Old Town, the area is really chill and perfect for lounging on a nice day. So if there's a wait, which there usually is... it's not a nuisance to hang out; it's a pleasure!   Like a lot of Old Town Scottsdale places, there is a certain hipster vibe you get from this place. If you go for a later breakfast like we usually do, you'll most certainly notice that about three fourths of the people eating there are club-goers from the previous night that went to bed way too late and drank too much while partying. Most of them look like they have not showered since getting home the previous night, and smell like a ridiculous mixture of B.O. and cheap cologne. Not exactly our crowd, but it does make for some fun people watching.   They have a lot of dishes that are more on the adventurous side of the breakfast spectrum, but also have all the tried and True's as well. We opted with the cinnamon challah french toast which was very good and an omelet which we just loaded with all sorts of good shit... it was also quite yummy. It's also cool that there is a little coffee bar inside that you can order from while you wait or get stuff from to accompany your meal.   All in all, we quite enjoyed The Breakfast Club... it's just a fun and chill little spot to grab a fresh and tasty morning treat.",

Some of my favorities are the Eggs Benedict, their breakfast burrito, and their chocolate chip pancakes, which are amazing if you're in the mood for a sweeter breakfast.

The service was timely and our server was calm, not super excited but did her job well and made sure we were taken care of. The food was great and there was a large variety of options.

I wasn't personally a fan of the potatoes but my family loved them and would absolutely order then again. My brother ordered the monte cristo which we all loved and would 100% order it again. My father ordered the mignon benni which was ok he loved it but the rest of us wouldn't order it again. My mom ordered the traditional benni and it was great, the hollandaise was great and really food for a traditional benni. Over all we all had pretty food meals and I definitely know what I would order again.",

The BC iced coffee with infused caramel was a perfect way to start the day.  I tried three different things, BC bagel, BC sandwich, and Breakfast grilled cheese.  They all were amazing!  The BC sandwich is great for a lighter choice and the horseradish mayo has great flavor and not overpowering.  The grilled cheese was phenomenial!  A bigger sandwich but mmmm mmmm good!  Bacon thick and perfect crunch, cheeses melt in your mouth and a heap of hashbrowns on your sandwich!  A definite must to get your day started!!",

What's cool is they have a bar area you can order from while you wait. They also have a text message feature where you can check the progress of your wait. We ended up waiting a lot shorter than expected, so that was nice.  The staff was very nice, and our server (Alana/Alanna, not sure of the spelling) was absolutely amazing. She was very upbeat, positive, and enthusiastic. You can tell she not only enjoys being there, but enjoys her customers as well.  The menu has plenty of options for breakfast, lunch, savory, sweet, health conscious, etc. What I had was good. I would say more about it, but I'm giving this place 5 stars for a reason. Perhaps you can find out for yourself? :)   The vibe is also very nice. It may tailor more to a certain generation or two, but it's most definitely appropriate for all ages. It may be a little loud inside, but that's mostly due to patron/employee conversation (not loud music like some places).  So, anyway. Great place. It gets as busy as it does for a reason. I recommend, and I look forward to visiting again.",

The name put me off at first, because the word \"club\" always makes me think about some cut-rate retail store, as calling businesses a \"club\" was trendy for a while. The other issue was the prominence of the bar. That normally means that the focus is on the beer, wine and cocktails, at the expense of the food, and the young \"hipsters\" as the expense of the everybody else.  To my great surprise, the food here really is the focus, with the beverages a nice complement to the great food. Even more, the service was very down to earth and the place was quite able to accommodate families and hipsters, the retired and the working class all together.",

    "text": "Thanks to Yelp's virtual waitlist we were able to snag a seat here. This place gets BUSY. There was even a wait for breakfast on a Monday, if that is any indicator.  I joined the waitlist from the hotel and by the time I arrived at Breakfast Club my wait was only a few minutes. I'm a big time #fangirl of this Yelp feature, just saying.  In Scottsdale most of the brunch spots open around 11, whereas the Breakfast Club starts serving food at around 6 or 7 AM. So it's basically like a diner with a hipper feel. Before 11 they are pretty much the only game in town for this (at least from what I came across) so the huge wait time is not surprising.   The menu is classic breakfast food. Again, it's sort of like an elevated diner experience. You can find anything from a breakfast burrito to chicken and waffles, and then of course there are a ton of omelette and pancake options. I went with a veggie frittata that had lots of fresh veggies, mozz cheese and was topped in a green goddess avocado pesto sauce. The cheese was melted on the top instead of mixed within which I didn't love, and there were also some cold slices of cucumber and tomato on top which didn't really blend with the eggs. Otherwise the dish was tasty! I also really liked the side of potatoes with onion and pepper.  Our server was extremely sweet and friendly and we were in and out in under an hour. Overall it's a good pick for a fast and quality breakfast. Not as trendy as some of the other brunch options in town, but for hearty breakfast you really can't go wrong.",

Their drinks are tasty, though they are a little pricy. My one issue with BC is spotty service. Some of the servers don't seem to care very much and depending on who you get, you may never see your waitress the whole time. It is not uncommon for them to disappear for a long time and you end up with empty drink glasses or wait a long time to order. I'm not sure if it is an issue with management or if they are perpetually understaffed. If you plan to go on a weekend day, I recommend calling ahead of time, seeing how long the wait is, and getting on the list. On a Saturday or Sunday, it can easily be 30-45 minutes and you can save yourself a lot of time by calling!",

We had planned on going to RnR, but they were closed when we got there at 7:30....I really need to stop assuming that restaurants actually open early for breakfast!!    My husband was working in the area and notice the Breakfast Club the day before and suggested that we give it a try.  I almost never try any restaurant without checking it out on Yelp first, but we were in a pinch.    Well, you know that saying \"everything happens for a reason\"...well, the reason by RnR wasn't open was so we would try Breakfast Club.  The host at the door was very friendly and welcoming, the restaurant was spotless, the service was very friendly and attentive, and the food was VERY good!  My husband had a custom-created omelet that was the Southwest version of a Denver omelet, but with Chorizo instead of ham.  It was fluffy and flavorful and loaded with tons of fresh veggies, cheese, and tasty Chorizo.  The omelet was plated with fresh sliced fruit, and AMAZING potatoes!!  I had the Southwest breakfast burrito and it was delicious!  It was eggs, Refritos negros, Lettuce, Chorizo & Cheddar Cheese.  (It usually comes with Pepperjack, but I subbed for Cheddar).  It was topped with a spicy sauce and I could have had it topped with Green Pork or Chorizo Queso, but I went plain.  It was very, very good!  My plate was also adorned with delicious fresh sliced fruit and the AMAZING potatoes.   The potatoes are large pieces of tenderly sauteed red potatoes with fresh peppers and onions.  Seriously...I have eaten many types of breakfast potatoes in my day and these are easily in the top 5!  We are only here for 4 days and I wouldn't be surprised if we go back again before we leave!",

    "text": "This place has quite the hype in Old Town Scottsdale, however I have begun to wonder why. Consistently I have received poor service the multiple times I have been, though the food is not terrible, it is certainly not a place to go have a meal with a staff that does not really hear and pay attention to what a customer is saying. We received the bill on this last visit, there was an item that was not ours, which I suspect is when the waitress goofed on the computer because when my breakfast arrived it was wrong, followed by taking 10 minutes to produce the right one. Then we asked her to fix it, my friend had put down her card, before noticing the goof, however we were going to separate the bill with our items; the waitress assumed she was paying and charged the whole bill to her card (she did not bother to clarify how we wanted to pay). Then we let her know we wanted to separate our items (I had even pen marked which items were mine on the itemized receipt). She then comes back with the bill just split in half, at this point we were already frustrated that our waitress refused to listen to us and simply kept making assumptions. I will not come here again (this is not the first time our service has been less than sublime), the food is not worth feeling as though the staff is not paying attention to their customers.  P.s., consistently when choosing a table outside, I have noticed they are slow to start the table off with even drinks at the least, thus keeping you waiting.",

    "text": "I am not a breakfast nut like my gal Nydi, but when I am feeling HUNGRY after a long night out there is nothing like some greasy wholesome breakfast food!    What sets Breakfast Club (BC) apart is the younger crowd and the lively vibe, and quite frankly just about everyone in the room seems to be in the same state I am when I stroll in here on the weekends...except the few random tourists.  The two servers I recently had here were fabulous and quite funny as well.  Sometimes I feel like they need background music in here though, I felt like I was very aware of everybody's conversation around me.  And heaven forbid anybody have to listen to me and my friends' ridiculous conversations...Although on the flip side I have met some cool neighborly people in the BC due to this feature.    My other complaint is there will most certainly be a wait.  However I guess that is to be expected in this busy part of town and a testament to their sound and hearty breakfast grub!  I usually just have crispy bacon and hash browns at the BC, but I can say all my friends have had some impressive and yummy breakfast dishes for a reasonable price!  I also highly recommend their hazelnut iced coffee; my server recommended it to me last time and it is now a staple when I come the the BC!",

Yet the table next to us where the girl who apperead to be around the same age as me was wearing a nice shirt and carrying a Louis bag got a huge friendly smile while you just had a blank dull fake smile when you talked to us..you would have gotten a good tip, but instead your attitude was unprofessional and rude.

Me and my girlfriend ordered eggs Benedict, and a breakfast burrito with chorizo queso. The food came out warm not hot. The fruit looked very dried out, and old. My biggest problem with the food was that it was flavorless. The potatoes were diced potatoes cooked with bell pepper, and had no seasoning whatsoever. The eggs Benedict did not have any flavor either. A little salt and pepper was all they needed, but I had to do that myself.. I usually love eggs benedict everywhere I go, but this was the worst I've had ever, mainly because it was so bland. My girlfriend had similar complaints about her burrito, but I can't really speak for her dish. It is a very nice place with a great atmosphere I would consider possibly coming again , and ordering something different.",

    "text": "Where do I start? A beautiful morning needed some good breakfast a couple of my friends suggested to come here. Me I did not want to because of the 3 and half stars on Yelp and reading a couple of reviews. But I always like to try places because everyone has a different opinion. We got there and they told us a 45 minute wait. It was nice outside so we suggested to wait because any place would be busy at that time. So we waited the 45 minutes and they call us inside. I look at the menu and I had no idea what to order. No like suggestions or Stars by popular plates how most places have it now. So I asked our waitress she gave me a couple options and I went with Border Bowl. From the description it sounded amazing. Bacon, ham, hash browns, etc. So I ordered that and their tomato soup. The soup wasn't soup it was like tomato sauce from a can.. Literally.. And right when my plate came out I looked for my bacon. I then found out it's like shredded bacon.. Very disappointed. The description didn't explain any of it or have any pictures. So I ate and I can eat a lot of food. On my 6th bite I couldn't do it. My stomach wasn't allowing it. It wasn't really bad. It just wasn't acceptable. My friends ordered the same thing and felt the same way. So I paid my 25$ breakfast.. Didn't know I had filet mignon. My stomach did not accept any of this food. I wanted to get it out of my system so bad but I just couldn't. I really was disappointed and im truly never coming back here again. Also the iced coffee there's a big poster outside about it and it looked so good and it has a special name so I thought this ice coffee was going to be BA. I think McDonald's ice coffee is better. Just truly wasn't satisfied. At least the women are good looking but got an attitude. Customer service was alright. 2 star joint. I would prefer something different maybe McDonald's breakfast?",

I ordered the BLT - probably my most favorite sandwhich - how could you mess it up?  Well, I will give props - the sandwhich was good - lots and lots of bacon, fresh tomato and lettuce.  the bread was typical nothing fancy there.     I am most disappointed in the sweet potato fries - they were sooo bland - I couldn't even tell I was eating a sweet potato.  I ate ONE fry and not one more.  Just because sweet potato fries are so trendy doesn't mean everyone should try to serve them.     The service was ok - nothing great - we had a table of 6 and it was the tail end of lunch, so the place wasn't busy.   the main complaint is that we were having a discussion about a friends dislike of eggs - when the waitress chimmed in and said \"yeah, I hate eggs - maybe because i work in a breakfast place and I know what happens with eggs\".....did I mention that one of us at the table was eating eggs???     Well she put her fork down after that comment.   Not so smart there....  I won't be going back - not because it was so terrible, but since it was so bland!",

    "text": "Honestly, Ive never written a bad comment on Yelp. But this place kind of deserves it. A group of 6 of us went on a busy Saturday morning. We knew that there would be a wait, but didn't antisipate an hour wait, epecially when we were told 20 minutes. When they finally called our name 30 minutes after we checked in, 3 of us came to the host stand ready to be seated. The incredibly RUDE host told us that we needed our whole party to be seated ( I really wish she would have told us that when we checked in!!!) After the rest of our party had arrived, we walked up to the host stand and informed them that our party was complete. She then informed us that we would have to wait for a table to get up because they gave our table away. No big deal, so we stood up front and waited..... and waited..... and waited. Until finally the hostess heard us talking about how long we had waited, so she begrudgingly led us to our table while she rolled her eyes at us. The service once we sat at the table was fine, and the food was excellent. But i have NEVER been treated like that before as a guest.  I have been in the Restaraunt industry for almost 8 years, 5 of which I was a host, and 3 years as a server. I usually am not one to complain because I know how it is being on the other side of things. But seriously, the front of house service here is absolutely appauling. In my 8 years, I have NEVER treated a guest the way that I was treated here. Hopefully they hire some good people soon...",

I also had some biscuits which were covered in some of the richest gravy I have ever eaten. I didn't touch the potatoes on the side because I was too full from eating everything else.  The best part of the this restaurant, in my opinion, is the coffee bar that is attached to the restaurant, but accessible through a side door. This really helps with the early morning wait.

The eggs were serviceable, but the potatoes O'Brian (I learned a new thing here!) were nothing special--kind of soft and oily, with large chunks of pepper. The jalepeno biscuits, which sounded conceptually grand, were not quite what I'd call a biscuit. They were tough, unflavorful little disks with jalepenos baked in. The heuvos rancheros looked like something my cat barfed up, however, they tasted fine, according to my breakfastmate.   Overall, I think this was a shade greasier than we were expecting. And outdoor seating is nice, but a mixed bag when abutting a busy road. The service was good, but something about the waitresses reminded me of the Stepford Wives.",

I swear I witnessed this exact scenario about 10 times in a row. But then after standing there for about a half hour, I looked down and realized I was one of them. Damn.  Oh well, the food is obviously decent, (it's really hard to mess up breakfast after all) but the people watching is even better. My favorite are the walk of shamers, stumbling across the street in last night's sexy outfit, high heels and smeared makeup only to turn back around after interpreting the situation and the wait time. Sometimes you just need food, I get it. I just happened to have time to get somewhat dressed.",

My friends and I took our cars up Camelback for a photoshoot at 7:00AM on a Sunday morning, but were saddened when we saw that a black Jetta with steamy windows had beaten us to the spot.  We left dejected but decided on this place for breakfast.  It was hands down the best breakfast I have ever bought.  The orange juice was fresh squeezed, the waitresses were pretty, punctual, and polite, the buckwheat and chocolate chip pancakes were fantastic, and the restaurant's atmosphere was pleasant and classy.  You'll pay a bit more for a meal (OJ and chocolate chip pancakes with a side of bacon was $17, not including tip), but it will be totally worth it.  I'll be taking my next girlfriend here for sure.",

So around TO BE EXACT from the hostesses 42 minutes, my boyfriend went up to ask where we were on the list and in a sassy rude way she said \"we quoted you for 45 minutes-1 hour and its been 42 minutes\" like okay. I remember putting my name in and getting quoted 45 minutes, but thats besides the point. I was a hostess back in the day and even when customers came in before their time there is no reason to be rude or snarky. There was like a whole squad of them there just with bad attitudes. After she gave that sass to my boyfriend about how much EXACTLY we were waiting for she told him \"why don't you go enjoy the sun some more\" like WHAT why is that okay to say to someone in such a rude manner? I don't know what their issues were. But the hostesses need an attitude adjustment and to learn to put on a smile and ignore it which is WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS!!!!!!!  The food was really good though. The food was huge portions but so yummy. Bloody Marys were good and spicy and our server was really nice and filled waters very quicky. And this smaller blonde lady with a southern accent was super sweet as well.  My boyfriend got the hog omelette and I got a the eggs bene and both were wonderful. I also really liked how they give you a fruit stick along with the potatoes.  I would've given this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the young hostesses who act like they are snobby b****es who apparently don't know how to put on a fake face because it's their first job.",

We ordered the quick start, which is the simplest thing on the menu, but I did not figure it would come out as if I had snapped my fingers.  Haley brought our plates steaming from the kitchen what felt not five minutes after putting in the ticket.  She then gave us coffees to go.",

There's construction across the street so the view left a lot to be desired but the food and service...good and great! The location is particularly great if you plan to spend time in the area shopping.   I opted for the Huevos Rancheros and a side of French toast. Definitely couldn't finish both in one sitting so it was nice to have leftovers for lunch. I also order an iced coffee and somehow enjoyed the presentation more than the brew itself.   All in all, I'm a fan. There are so many yummy breakfast options in the area that I look forward to trying other places but when I'm back in town for a visit I would keep Breakfast Club as a contender for another meal.",

    "text": "For the price, the wait, and quality of food, this place is at best a 2.  I know, I know, there are some innovative dishes on the menu.  I know, it isn't *that* expensive.  I know, the brunch drink offerings are diverse and interesting (talking to you, Kombucha Mule), and there is a great variety of choice there.  However, the two items I ordered were both sub-par, and one egregiously so in a way that was really shocking, which I'm detailing here.  So, let's just start with the Lox & Bagel dish.  First, when you order it, you don't want to hear the waitress say \"An everything bagel ok?\" because it implies either: they're bad w/inventory or they're pushing the high priced bagel for reasons you don't understand but likely aren't good.  But as it was, I was asked that and I immediately just said \"Yes, no problem.\"  Second, let's compare what I got to what was on the menu:  Lox & Bagel Stack smoked salmon | tomatoes | capers | hard boiled egg | avocado | pickled onion | creamed cheese  I'll grant you, they do put the word \"stack\" on the menu.  But that's not in and of itself telling enough to warn a customer of the COMPLETE ODDITY of what is actually served.  First, let's deal with the False advertising (be ready for a ton of \"...as you would guess, but rather...\" clauses):  1) The \"avocado\" is not sliced avocado as you would guess, but rather literally guacamole. 2) The \"tomatoes\" are not normal tomatoes sliced in 1/4 in sections as you would guess, but rather halved cherry tomatoes. 3) The \"tomatoes\" are not separated out as you would guess, but rather mixed into the \"avocado\" (read: guacamole), and in fact not visible upon initial inspection at the sides of the guac 4) The \"hard boiled egg\" is not whole and sliced as you would guess, but rather included in your run of the mill egg salad mash (w/mayo, and some salt I presume). 5) There were no capers, and honestly, one of the four essential ingredients in lox/bagel servings are the capers. 6) The salmon wasn't sliced and in sheets as you would guess, but rather chunked up in 1/2 in rectangular prisms as if it was going to be part of a unique Peruvian ceviche. 7) The cream cheese wasn't actual cream cheese in normal form, but rather a kind of whipped cream cheese with an unexpected consistency. 8) The entire lot of it wasn't separated out into its own piles or sections as you would expect from literally ANY PLACE ON THE KNOWN PLANET, but rather \"stacked\" (per the menu one-word adjective) on top of one another in four basic layers.  The ONLY things that were normal were the bagel itself and the pickled onions.  So the menu was completely and utterly misleading.  To top it off, the salmon was overly pink/bordering on taupe, and seemed roughed up and warm (effect of being chopped, handled and stacked?), and the guac was sub-par, with the cherry tomatoes unfortunately drowning in it such that I wasn't able to get a bright, tomato-only taste from them.  The lack of capers at all, the cream cheese being alien and then the egg being what I could expect inside a sandwich at 7-11, and I give this dish a solid 0.  I mean, it really deserves a negative score, however, Yelp hasn't provided such a feature for the exceptionally bad and mis-advertised....yet.  Adding to this, I pointed out all the inconsistencies in the menu, verbatim, to the manager and he did offer once condolence (Yes, it's probably confusing), and said they are overhauling their menu and would take this into account.  However, I wasn't offered a comp on the dish.  Also, he actually stated \"Well, sir, for future, you can always ask to have it prepared deconstructed...\"  Uhhh, yes thank you for that suggestion, but I would have to clearly know it was *constructed* in some bizarre way beforehand, other than one single adjective (\"Stack\") on the menu.  To be totally honest, I did start by saying \"I'm not looking for a comp here, but...\" statement.  However, the fact that an offer didn't come from him, that it would have been a paltry $14.50 write-off, a small price to pay in the face of food description so inaccurate and dissembling that I needed 8 numbers to point all the issues out, and that we ordered 5 drinks from the bar along with 4 entrees so it's not like we're skimming, and this place gets a solid 1 from me.  I thank only Maya, our waitress, who I over-tipped of course ($50 on $34, cash) as she was working hard to please a pleasant, but clearly stunned patron.",

The staff were all attentive and courteous while we were there  I ordered the chilaquiles and it did not disappoint. The food came out pretty quick as well. I love different textures in my food and this hit all the spots.   A crunch tostada sits on top of tender chunks of savory pork with a layer of well done black beans. Since the tostada was elevated on the meat, it kept it from getting soggy. I had eggs over easy and they came out perfectly with flowing golden egg yolk. The avocado and lettuce added some freshness and helped to cut the meal a bit as it's a pretty heavy and filling meal. Everything was flavored extraordinarily well.   It was one of the better chilaquiles I've had and would definitely stop by again.",

    "text": "Came here with my family on a mini vacation. We had a group of 11 and therefore on a Sunday morning its not the easiest thing to get in they were fortunately were able to get us in with only a 30 minute or so wait so that was good with us. While we waited many of us enjoyed their Mango Mimosas and Lemonades. I wasn't much of a fan of their Mango Mimosas (why change up an already prefect thing) but their lemonade was delicious, especially in the AZ heat.   The restaurant itself is located at a very nice spot and is huge. Probably why they are able to seat larger groups. The service was also very attentive and polite especially for the place being packed and on an hour wait by the time we got seated.   The majority of the group ordered breakfast burritos, with a couple of us ordering their Steak and Eggs, and Huevos con Masa. Everything was delicious even though the Steak and Eggs really wasn't filling (weak Steak size) and kind of left me and my brother wanting more food. I ended up ordering their homemade Jalapeno Cheddar Biscuit after my Steak and Eggs for more food which was also delicious. Best thing I tasted on their menu was the Huevos con Masa it was delicious and full of flavor.  Overall I would absolutely be back. Am definitely a fan!.",

Which means a cook, a server and our server (after I pointed out the chip and greasy plate)  Were too busy to care about how the food served to me represents their place of business.   I didn't need the food to be remade. I just think my request that my food at an upscale breakfast restaurant be brought out with a wow-factor-can't wait-to dive-in-but-must-take-a-picture-first-to remind-me-how-amazing-this-restaurant-is.   Disappointing and honestly,I think reasonably - a just expectation.   Yes We will be back but maybe we might revisit a few of our other favorite breakfast/brunch joints.   This didn't make us feel very special but just a number and lost the excitement we had for this place.   Food is really good and prices are on point.",

However, The Breakfast club is my go to place for breakfast when in Old Town. First, they open the door for you when your still on the sidewalk and that alone is five star service. They always greet me with a genuine smile when I stand at the hostess stand. All the staff there are friendly and excellent in service. The must have entree is their Huevos Rancheros.. It is worth blowing your diet on! I drown mine in Tabasco and Cholula and yowzers! It's delicious. If you can get there early as to get a good seat and not have to wait. After 9 am it is busy and rightfully so, don't forget to order a tigers milk to cool off!!",

Well it was and I'm glad I finally stopped by. We arrived around 8:30 so we didn't have to wait and we sat on the patio which was nice and shaded. I ordered their BC Iced Coffee and it was really good. Flavors of caramel and hazelnut topped off with milk, yum!   I ordered the breakfast grilled cheese and it was really good. It was a little greasy but to be expected for a grilled cheese but kinda messy for breakfast. It was worth it though, it was yummy and a great combination of egg, cheese, potatoes and bacon. I would definitely recommend this option to anyone who enjoyed a good breakfast sandwich!   This place is really good and I definitely understand why there is always a line. I enjoyed going to early to beat the rush and will be back soon!",

Fortunately, Breakfast Club is not too far from either of our offices. Also fortunate is how good the food and service is!  Kayla was our server and she was excellent. I arrived first and she brought a pitcher of coffee to keep me company while I waited. It's got to be hard to be so personable this early in the morning, but she managed. Her timing throughout the meal was perfect as well. I also appreciated her offering a coffee to go.  The menu at Breakfast Club has plenty of options. It includes the basics, comfort food, healthy options and some elevated surprises. The next time I'm here, I want to try the Eggs Benedict which is served over a filet mignon. But my entree from this visit was delicious. The Border Bowl included scrambled eggs with literally everything but the kicker was the green chili pork on top. It's a great breakfast and very filling.  My buddy and I got a chance to start our day right. Breakfast Club is clean, modern and relaxing. And the kitchen provided a very memorable breakfast. I don't plan to wait until next April to visit again.",

Although it was super packed on a Saturday morning at 8, we lost our place in line which they sign you up for using your number due to a systematic error where our reserved place in line using yelp actually which I loved, was forfeited for some reason. When I told the young lady at the front she did a fantastic job assisting me in resolving this inconvenience by immediately seating us.   Chelsea was our server and tended us to very well she checked on us twice and offered a bag for our leftover food containers without me even having to ask. She also asked for which condiments we liked and brought a little rack of hot sauce.   The food was soooo good! It was so nutritious and healthy just up my alley as I love eating healthy and so does my sister. The portions were really large. The tinga chicken omelette was very good and flavorful something I definitely prefer over a bland omelette. The way it was garnished deserved a round of applause. I also appreciated that my mango smoothie which was super good not too sweet and syrup filled. The picture speaks for itself!",

I wanted breakfast. I've been here in the past but it's been a while and historically speaking there has always been a rather ridiculous wait, so I was apprehensive about heading there around brunch time on a Sunday.   Open seating at the bar, so that was a bonus, there happened to be 2 seats available. It took my friend a few extra to decide and I was also torn considering lunch and breakfast were options. I went with the huevos con masa and I am so stoked that I did because all day after breakfast I kept talking about the awesome breakfast that I had.   The friend went with the burrito which I'd had in the past.   I do have to admit, we probably would have had a bit quicker service had we sat at a table but they did their best with us at the bar.   I ordered my eggs over medium and I was certainly impressed that that is exactly how they were prepared. Perfectly.   I'm glad we went in and I will be visiting again soon. Definitely a decent breakfast spot!",

By the time we arrived, our text came in and our table was ready. They had a nice selection of food, a relaxed attractive environment with a pretty diverse crowd for Scottsdale. Service was nice, it was pretty fast, food was good. They make substitutions and even have almond milk and other dietary substitutes that many people like myself find necessary. Hope our next visits are as good as the last two visits.",

If you're going to go there on the weekends, please get there as early as possible otherwise you will be waiting for an hour. This is not a reflection of how poor the service is, it is a reflection of how good the food is. It is well prepared, uses high grade ingredients, and always made to order.   It is not like going to Denny's as I have read on other reviews here. As far as the service goes, the staff that work there work their asses off. I have yet to see any of the workers milling around or chatting with their coworkers. Yes you will pay a little more, but it worth it. Take away: if you plan ahead and leave your childish pretensions about what good service is at home, you will have an excellent breakfast!",

    "text": "Came here based on the recommendation of a few people we met during our stay in Scottsdale.   We ordered:    Breakfast Bowl - Think breakfast burrito without the tortilla and with pork green chili on top of your scramble.    Huevos Rancheros - Breakfast tostada bowl but the tortilla is not crispy.  Topped with green chili sauce.   Biscuits and gravy - very dense. Not too much flavor  Mushroom omelette - needed more mushroom.  Creme fraiche is pretty much sour cream.   Overall, food was good.  Some dishes were better than others.  We recommend getting the dishes with the pork chili, since the chili was really tasty.    Service:  Very nice.    Ambience:  Cute, casual breakfast joint.  Pretty large place with ample seats inside and outside.  Parking: Ample rear parking   Overall:  For food, we would give 3.5-4 stars.  Good breakfast joint but short of mind blowing. If you are near by, I'd pop in but I wouldn't go out of my way for this one.",

Perhaps we were taking too long as our waitress brought our bills (BTW, we were sitting for less than 1 hour at that point). She then proceeded to take my plate and place another one on top of it. Did she ask if I was finished? No, she did not. I still had my fruit and potatoes left.  Since 2 of us lingered a bit longer I left a 20% tip...She did not deserve that much with her terrible service. She then came back to our table and asked us to leave and sit somewhere up front and talk. As it is, when I sit at table that could have turned, I am sure to compensate the server well. never gave us that chance.   I was so angry, I decided not to tell the Manager because I would not have behaved well. I will never go back and not only will I not recommend it, I will be sure to tell many others!",

    "text": "Some impressions:  Hostess tried to seat us at the worst table in the house (back, next to kitchen door)  in spite of the many open tables.  When we requested reseating, she obliged. Ambiance is open and noisy; plenty of room between tables; hard to hear the person across from you.  Waitrons, all female, wear a uni of skintight workout clothes.  So, like, if you'd like to do some Bikram yoga with your breakfast, maybe they can oblige.  Did I mention that they all appear to have been ordered from the same Chinese rubber factory?  \"Huevos con masa\" looked offbeat and interesting - a change from the usual breakfast stuff.  It was not.  Two not-very-hot eggs atop highly sweetened dry cornbread with a wobbly sauce that looked like cat upchuck.  Al dente dinner potatoes and a vicious-looking spear of fruit.    Hey people - masa is not the same thing as cornbread.  WTF?  We looked at this and my pal ordered toast.  The waitress brought it promptly.  He asked for butter.  She looked at him funny, went back, eventually brought that out.  Then he asked for jam.  She looked at him funny again, and returned with some very nice raspberry preserves.  Evidently on this planet, people don't eat toast, and if they do, there better not be anything on it.  Total for breakfast about $30; we left two nearly-full plates of food on the table.  The toast was very good.",

So my aunt was in town from Detroit, MI and we wanted to take her out to breakfast as a family so that we one we showed her love while being out here and two so we don't get slandered when she goes back \"I didn't see them\"  anyone who has family can relate.  Moving forward we decided to take her here and I must say I was thoroughly impressed. It was a party of 8 my sister and I arrived first and the waitress did a great job of showing patience while waiting for the rest of our party to show up. Then I informed her how my first experience went and she gave me some recommendations and informed me if I didn't like what I ordered they could make me something else . I liked how she gave me that extra security while ordering my food!! So I decided to pick \"The Bird\" omelette(egg whites) meal with a side of Carmel Banana Foster French toast w/ ice cream on the side. It was amazing everything tasted amazing and it was hot and the presentation was great. My family and I enjoyed it and we appreciate when we can bring a out of town relative to a restaurant and hear her say \"I LOVE THIS PLACE\". I will dine here again.. Oh a helpful tip on weekends it can be packed and they don't take reservations but they do have a call ahead service which was beneficial! As soon as we got there they sat us at a table right away with no waiting!!",

I got The Bird omelette, filled with fresh sliced turkey, avocado, mushrooms and creme fraiche, potatoes o'brien and fresh fruit.   It was a freaking TON of food for $10/$11 - I should have shared with my boyfriend. I had to tap out 2/3 of the way though my omelette, hardly touched my potatoes and ate my pineapple slice and watermelon slice. Totally worth the money, great service and wonderful atmosphere.   I look forward to visiting again in the future!",

    "text": "We were pressed to leave by our server, (unnamed), this was a first for me during a business brunch.  (Unnamed server) blatantly removed our empty coffee cups (after nicely clearing our plates), and told us In not so many words to pay and leave because people were waiting to be sat.  Now, in her defense,  she did offer to move us up to somewhere in the waiting area if we wanted to continue our work discussion.  Please note that we were not by any means using the table for an extended period of time, maybe 45 minutes in total.  First, I've served tables for many years in the past and wouldn't dare ask a table to leave.  Second, I'm well aware of our use of the table and would have tipped accordingly if we stayed long, instead, I really didn't even want to leave anything for the embarrassment she caused, but we did, of course. We likely wouldn't have stayed but another 10-15 more minutes anyway, but it's the principle of the matter.  To add insult to injury, when I attempted a small joke to her about taking our coffee cups when I thought we were just getting topped off after she asked for us to to pay and leave, she quickly responded not by saying what a server should, 'that the table is ours and we are happy to have you here', but rather, she said that if I wanted more coffee she'd be happy to fill me a to go cup. Mind you all reading this post, we were polite and respectful patrons. Very very disappointed in the Breakfast Club.  She actually cleared our table, then asked us to pay and leave, and shrugged her shoulder....wow",

I ordered the BC Sandwich with my Lemonade. My sandwich came out in 5 minutes. The sandwich was good, fresh and hot. The menu prices are very reasonable. The server was nice however no WOW experience. She never did a check back and the bus person took my plate after she presented the check. I asked for a refill on my Lemonade and she said refills aren't free. I thought that seemed pretty strange for a casual breakfast / lunch restaurant. I did appreciate that she told me before just charging me. The restaurant was fairly clean however it had a terrible odor not a food smell. I was in the back of the restaurant and noticed it was worse. It wasn't a pleasant smell. I might return if I was in the area but probably wouldn't refer to friends.",

My brother's drink went empty multiple times, my dad's food came out wrong and we barely saw our server and when we did she did not seem like she wanted be to there. we we're dining here for my dad's birthday & it really dampers a celebration to get completely awful service. I was hoping this girl was just having an off day but the next time I came to BC I sat in her section again and we received the same awful service. Not only does she walk around with RBF but she didn't seem to care about our needs. She barely stopped by and seemed to avoid us - but is smiling when talking to other employees. The reputation built by the food & nice hostesses are ruined by the attitude of this server. I will not bring my service this location ever again!",

A lot looked like they came from the gym..or just wearing workout clothes ;)   SEATING: They do have some counter/bar seating as well as a variety of other tables. It's not actually a large space and we did have to wait about 15mins (at 10:30am on a Friday).  Annoyingly they have quite a few high top tables and stools when you first walk in for \"waiting only\". Seems like a waste of space, if they served at these tables there would be less waiting.  They do have outdoor space with misters   SERVICE:  Pretty good  FOOD: Again, good not great. I got the Huevos Ranchero - which was NOT Huevos Ranchero...it was a soft flour tortilla, lots of lettuce, no ranchero sauce. Super disappointing. The avocado was presented beautifully, the best part of the meal  The menu has a lot of variety so would be good for a group  DRINKS:  They have the brunch basics (mimosa, Bloody Mary, etc) I got one with grapefruit juice and vodka. It was huge and just ok   PARKING: There is parking out from and a parking garage",

I also like the fact that they offer turkey products as well and not just pork. It's interesting how several breakfast restaurants still do not offer turkey alternatives to their sausage and bacon foods.   In addition, make sure that you try their coffee. They have one of the best coffee's I have had at a breakfast restaurant. The next time I am in the area I will definitely come back again.",

    "text": "Deplorable, is how I describe my experience at the Breakfast Club.  A friend and I dropped in after a hike on Camelback Mountain. We arrived at 2:40pm. We were aware that the restaurant would be closing at 3pm and already knew what we wanted to order. We were waiting at the front for a hostess and were not greeted for 3 minutes.  There was no one at the front. When the phone began ringing I was sure someone would come to the frnt but no one did!  In fact, three waitresses made eye contact with us then ignored us.  Finally, the bartender hollered over that we can sit anywhere we like and to seat ourselves.  We chose a table outside due to having a dog with us.  When our waitress arrived she was contemptuous.    We ordered our food immediately after the waitress brought us water.  We also asked for a couple cups of coffee.  Before our food came out, our waitress came back to our table and informed us \"by the way they poured out the last pot of coffee so there is no more coffee\". We were perplexed that she wouldn't just brew another pot if we wanted another cup, which we did. When our food finally arrived half of the food was hot and the other was cold.  My potatoes were hot and appeared to have come right off the stove however my eggs were cold.  How was it possible that my eggs were just made but became cold so quickly? We asked for a manager to explain what I have written above. The manager was very nice and apologetic and offered to remake our plates.   After receiving our remade plates, we noticed the waitress's and busser began closing up shop. While we were still eating, our waitress asked if she could take any plates away and if we needed our sugar packets any longer... Our plates weren't even half eaten. I was so appalled that she was trying to take away anything she could from our table that I considered asking her if she \"needed to collect our silverware to put in the dishwasher leaving us to use our hands?\" We paused before we replied that we were not done with the sugar. Soon after the bus boy began turning off the space heaters, including the one at our table. We had to finish our food in the cold. I was quickly beginning to feel like a second class citizen. There were a couple of parties still finishing up their food inside when the waitresses were placing the chairs on top of the tables in preparation for closing. I'm sure particles of dust and dirt were swept into the air and landing on their food. At the very least, I was comforted that we weren't the only ones receiving bad service, as weird as that sounds.    In the end, the manager comped our meal and we left most of it on our plate after being freezed out and our waitress chomping at the bit to take our plates away. Her behavior was more clamorous than our dog who was hoping we would drop crumbs that she could gobble. Needless to say, our experience was regrettable. We expected very different from a restaurant in Old Town with a modern open feel and large bar.  I frequently see lines out the door for the restaurant and it looked like a happening place. My advice is if you are going to dine here be sure you will be finished with all your food before 2:40pm otherwise your service will quickly dissolve.  I'm still wandering if they gave me eggs off of someone else's plate which would explain why they were cold. If the Breakfast Club does not want to serve until 3pm as their hours state they should close their kitchen earlier or close the restaurant earlier.  They certainly should not have asked us to have a seat and treat us as if it was an imposition.",

    "text": "I have always been a big fan of this place. I have been coming here on the weekends for the past 4 years and it never disappoints. Every time my parents come into to town they come eat here. They will drive down from north Scottsdale every morning for breakfast. Sometimes I end up going here back to back on Saturday and Sunday! Anytime I have someone visiting from out of town, this is where I take then for breakfast. Be prepared to wait on the weekends but it's well worth the wait. You can always grab a drink at the coffee bar while you are waiting. They move people in and out pretty quickly.   The omelets are great (the Whole Hog being my favorite). The fresh fruit that's comes with the omelets is good. Omelets come with potatoes too, but I often substitute toast for the potatoes. The Lean and Green omelette is also a good option if you are trying to behave. I'll substitute turkey and broccoli for the fruit and potatoes if I'm trying to keep it healthy.   The blueberry pancakes and the french toast are incredible. If you get the french toast, make sure to get the fresh fruit and nuts on top. It's a game changer! Even if I get an omelette, I can't help but order 1 pancake or 1 piece of french toast on the side, or both :) It's that good!   I can't speak to any of the lunch menu items because the breakfast is that good! Maybe I'll try a lunch item one day, but not any time soon. If you are not in a rush and have some time to hang out, this is the perfect place for breakfast or brunch on the weekends!",

We have picky eaters from carnivores to vegetarians, including some that don't eat eggs!   Table Ordered the breakfast grilled cheese, huevos ranchero, jalapeno cheddar biscuit, mushroom benedit(has another name on their menu), yogurt/granola and a order of waffles for the table! All items were delicious, the biscuit was very cheesy, and my grilled cheese was made to perfect(hash browns, with cheddar eggs and substituted bacon for avocado!) each dish also came with fresh fruit, which was very delicious!!!   The fresh oj is a must!!   Overall had a great time despite a 20 minute wait on a Friday morning! Now I know why the wait occurs, want to come back if time permits before we go!!!",

Had an egg white omelet with roasted tomatoes,  swiss cheese,  avocado and turkey. Very yummy!  We also enjoyed a scrambled egg mixture with chorizo and other yummy ingredients.  Very flavorful and a hint of spice.   Enjoyed some yummy french toast with fresh light maple syrup.  The turkey bird omelet was also well enjoyed with a nice white creamy sauce.  Expect a 30 to 40 minute wait but it is worth it.  You can purchase a coffee and or other drinks while you are waiting.  They will refill your coffee when seated no extra charge.  Hope you like our food pics.",

It was mid-morning and wasn't crowded, so there was really no excuse. It's a shame because we would have gone back there for the food.

    "text": "Booo!    When a restaurant is super busy, very popular and has large crowds, it can mean two things - it's an awesome place to eat or you're going to have bad service and cold food.  For us it was the latter.    We were taken to the patio (dog friendly) to be seated. I don't own a dog and I find it repulsive to be sitting next to someone else's dog while I eat!  My chair was right by a the door to the patio.  We asked to be seated inside.    Waitress took our order and it was about 20-30 minutes before we were finally served.  I ordered an OMELET MY WAY and did not get it my way!  All there was on the plate was an omelet, no fruit and no side of bacon.  The bacon was in the omelet which I did not request.  A different waitress took it back to the kitchen and returned the plate with a side of bacon and hash browns (which I didn't ask for). My fruit with whipped cream also arrived and was the best part of the meal.  The hash browns were cold and the bacon was cold and leathery.  My whole meal and experience was screwed up.    Then Mister Manager himself said something about our waitress having personal problems with her father because she never returned to follow up on our meal or provide the bill.  If it was me, I would let her go home to deal with it and get another waitress to take care of the patron, instead he just kind of stood off to the side.  I'm not sure what his purpose was.  The bill was screwed up because they charged for items I didn't ask for and didn't charge me for items I got.    I don't think I'll be eating here anytime soon.   The second star is for my husband's breakfast which was good and correct.",

    "text": "Took my husband out for breakfast and didn't want to go to our typical spots. I saw Breakfast Club on yelp-4 stars and over 850 reviews-it seemed promising. Thank goodness I joined the waitlist on Yelp. It was 9 am on a Monday but there was a 20 minute wait?? I figured this place must be amazing! When we arrived, the 20 minute wait was almost done but we ended up having to wait another 10 minutes at the restaurant. It wasn't a huge pain since they have lots of tables for waiting customers. We are seated by the hostess and receive menus. Less than 20 seconds later our waitress shows up asking what we would like to drink. Not sure yet we just order waters and let her know we just arrived. She practically rolls her eyes but simultaneously plasters on a smile and says \"sure! Take your time!\" while still standing there. My husband and I look at each other and quickly order drinks, coffee and a latte. Fast forward to 10 min later and she hasn't returned with drinks or to see if we are ready to order. I guess she really meant she would be taking her time. I didn't see her helping other tables so I don't know why it took so long. She finally comes out with my husband's coffee but says my latte isn't ready yet. Quite the wait for a simple small latte...We try to order and the waitress isn't even sure of some of the items. \"Is the biscuit and gravy two biscuits or just one?\" My husband just wanted a small side. \"Umm, well the biscuit is cut in half so it's just one. Well actually maybe it's two. Haha, I don't know for sure.\" Okay...thanks? We order, another long wait, the food comes out. And after this whole ordeal, I take a bite and I'm relieved to say it tastes...JUST OKAY? I got a slice of French toast and hash browns, basic breakfast place stuff and it's just okay....Thankfully the waitress only came by once to check on us and at that time I was able to just ask for the check. This place really disappointed my husband and I. The prices are really good but the food is mediocre. I much much rather go to Matt's Big Breakfast. But obviously from its rating some people really enjoy this place! I will say that the restaurant was male dominated and almost all of the waitresses were completely arm and back baring with slightly low cut spaghetti strapped shirts. I saw another reviewer post that it's the \"Breakfast Hooters\". So I'm not sure if that's the reason why people come here. I can just say from my experience with the staff and food that I won't be back!",

My favorite dish is the breakfast grilled cheese, which I never regret getting. No matter what day of the week you go, the wait is insane. However, the counter is first come first serve so you could end up not even waiting to sit down. However, if you want a table, the wait usually seems to be around 30-45 minutes. The servers are very attentive and so kind to the customers. Also, this place is also very affordable, and the prices are not that expensive unlike other brunch restaurants. Great place to go if you are looking for a quick and good meal!",

The Breakfast Club in Scottsdale does not disappoint.  Though not so much a classic yet, they do serve a mean breakfast - Yum!   I ordered the Eggs Benedict while my partner ordered 2 eggs breakfast.  Eggs Benedict Arnold - haha! (Peter Griffin from Family Guy).  Needless to say I loved a good old fashion breakfast and they did not skimp on the portions.  (Enough for 5 mischievous students hmmm).  Like going back in time, back to the 80's, where breakfast was a time to stuff your face!  My eggs were over easy for sure while the soft and warm hollandaise sauce gently glazed over the eggs and ham.  Not too overpowering and just the right sweetness.  I had my hash extra crispy and my bacon; I like them soft and chewy.  I added some hot sauce and I had myself a grand meal.  Will you recognize me? (After eating here and gaining some weight) Call my name and walk on by (A walk more like a run I'll need) Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling (More like falling asleep) Down, down, down, down (I go!) (Simple Mind - Don't You \"Forget about me\")  The place itself had a business diner yet modern feel.  Not your typical dive diner for sure!  Service was spot on and keep that coffee flowing! - Enjoy!",

The food was good, nothing special however. When I ordered coffee, it came out cold, but the waitress replaced it quickly. The staff was friendly but service was average. Overall it was good, but nothing special. Good spot to bring co-workers or friends. Oh there might be a little wait early morning and during lunch time.",

My wife ordered the Challah bread french toast, it was dry and didn't even look like it was Challah bread. Mine was worse, I ordered the Huevos Rancheros. The flavor of the pork was good but that's about it. It looked like dog food, and the order of the ingredients were all wrong. The egg was burried under pounds of pork so when I found it to cut, the yolk had already disappeared in the beans below it. They make a tortilla shell act as the base in a bowl, like a taco salad, so it's hard to include the tortilla with each bite. The pork was so watery/greasy that after a while the whole bowl was just a bowl of mush. Friendly wait staff though, fairly attentive, so they can refill your water or coffee well.",

Secondly it's pretty cute and the patio has those misters that are ubiquitous in Phoenix. But, the thing that really got my pulse racing was the idea of jalapeno biscuits and gravy. I've said over and over how I'm always looking for delicious biscuits and gravy and have such a hard time finding them. I thought I may have struck gold with the addition of jalapenos.  Unfortunately I didn't. The meal was just okay. The thing that made it weird for me was that there was a layer of biscuits, then a layer of cheese, then the gravy which was topped with eggs. I like eggs, but usually on the side. I love cheese, but I really only wanted the gravy on the biscuits.   Oh well, each to his or her own. The place was cute, the servers friendly and I'd go back to try something else if I were back in town.",

    "text": "LOVE The Breakfast Club!  I must admit that my whole life was spent going to greasy spoon restaurants for breakfast...  Until I met a friend who is an interior designer.  She suggested that I get away from my backwoods grass roots and go to brunch somewhere that has \"real\" food.    The only reasons why it got 4 instead of 5 stars: Going to The Breakfast Club for Saturday brunch is not a good idea when you are starving.  Chances are you will have about a 30+ minute wait, but the wait is well worth it.  Also, you can't sit on the patio and drink alcohol.  Which really sucked when after a 45 minute wait we were seated, handed our menu's, got comfortable, and then were told that we had to move inside if we were going to drink mimosas.  This was the only bad experience in the 10+ times we have been there since.  Good:  When we walked into The Breakfast Club, I could see why my interior designer friend loves this place.  Simplistic design keeps it clean and feeling uncrowded, even when every seat in the house is full (and this place can hold a LOT of people for its size.)  The food is amazing, and although I have tasted other items on the menu I order the biscuits and gravy and a mimosa or two every time we go.  The staff is cute, friendly and attentive and everything is a decent price.",

If I order lunch, I typically just get the grilled cheese and tomato soup. I must warn that the tomato soup is more brothy than creamy. The salads are ok but not worth the 45min table wait.

It was perfectly spicy, and the Hollandaise was very good.  I had the Huevos Rancheros. I have had it twice before, and it is consistently good. It could be a tad hotter, or spiced up, but I like my food hot. Like 10 out of 10 hot. Not much a gripe, just a preference.  Service was great. Server was fun, friendly, and efficient.

After our food was brought out she never returned back to ask how everything was or if we needed refills. I had to flag her down to ask for our checks. A few of us paid with cards, a few with cash. Those with cash did not need change back. When she brought the other checks back for signing she proceeded to say \"did I do something to not deserve a tip?\" Mind you those who paid with cash gave at least a 20% tip minus one person. She did not give those who paid with a card time to even sign their bill and enter the tip and total amount before she called our table out in the middle of the restaurant. Then she proceeded to make a nasty comment when she walked away. It was very rude and unprofessional for her to call out a table in front of other people before people even had time to determine a tip or sign their check! I understand that servers work for tips and I respect servers very much but this was beyond rude that a customer walking out at the same time as us even made a comment stating how rude she was. Needless to say we won't be returning and those who had yet to enter a tip amount BEFORE her outburst did not leave a tip after that because she did not deserve it.",

    "text": "I really can't recommend The Breakfast Club.   It's been on my mental \"to try\" list for awhile and I was excited to check it out for brunch with a girlfriend. I've heard it is a busy place on weekends, so I took advantage of a rare weekday off to go and try it without having to fight weekend crowds.   Upon entering, I was impressed with the decor: a cute, bright bar borders the front area and there is a smattering of high cocktail tables with barstools in the \"Bar/lounge\" area. The buttery yellow freestanding curved booths through the center of the room are tres-cute and the cheery color scheme is complemented by the exposed brick walls - all adorable! There are windows lining one side of the dining room and an outdoor patio with umbrellas that would likely be lovely in nicer weather (but not in July)   I showed up on time, but my friend had texted me to let me know she was running a little late.   There was no one, I repeat NO ONE waiting when I entered the restaurant, and several free tables of varying sizes were available in the dining room. The bar area was pretty empty (I think there were a few people sitting up at the counter)   I approached the hostess stand, where THREE hostesses were standing around, not helping anyone. I let them know that I needed a table for two, and was asked where the other person was. I explained that she was running a few minutes late and the girl haughtily advised me that \"we don't seat incomplete parties - you can wait over there until she gets here\". Over there was the bar area. I awkwardly clambered up onto one of the barstools and sat alone while alternating between staring at my phone and eying the several still empty tables in the dining room. After about 5 minutes of this, I was fed up. I get it, the Breakfast Club is a busy breakfast spot on the weekends. I bet that the \"we don't seat incomplete parties\" rule is something to live by on Saturdays and Sundays. I'm sure that they're overrun with pushy, obnoxious people demanding tables and annoying guests who camp out at tables for hours on end while waiting for their elusive additional guests who never show up. But this was a Friday, there were empty tables, and I wanted to sit down and order a drink instead of being punished by being forced to sit in their lobby since my friend hadn't gotten there yet. So, I tried again in hopes that they'd relent in light of their non busyness. But alas, the young, rude hostesses unhelpfully stuck to their guns and directed me back to the bar area.   When my friend arrived, we were promptly seated in a booth at the back of the restaurant. We waited a considerable amount of time for a server to finally come to the table (my 10 minutes of waiting in the lobby would've been more productively spent sitting at my booth waiting for the server to finally show up - the timing would've been perfect!)   I asked for a Diet Coke and was smugly advised that \"we don't carry any diet sodas... we have bottled natural sodas\" This was weird, but this is Scottsdale so I guess I should expect pretension (?) I switched my order to Orange Juice - flustered by the server's curt demand for the size I'd like, I mistakenly answered \"large\"... we'll revisit this in a moment.   For my entree, I tried their BCs B&G - it seemed like one of the few interesting items on the menu, with Jalapeno Biscuits topped with fontina, sausage gravy, and eggs.. I was looking for some flavor and the jalapeno biscuits sounded like just the ticket. Unfortunately, I was wrong. There was a little hot sauce drizzled on top of the gravy, but even that was overwhelmed by the creamy blandness of the gravy, leaving the dish heavy and lacking in any sort of complexity. My friend ordered an omelet and  she remarked that it was very greasy.   When our server dropped off the check, I learned that my large orange juice was $7.00 (!!) I took another sip of my average glass of orange juice, just to ascertain if perhaps I had groggily ordered a mimosa or screwdriver in lieu of my standard OJ... NOPE! Regular orange juice = $7.00, guys. FYI.   I can't pinpoint what I disliked most about sitting by my lonesome little self in the bar...perhaps it was that it was morning and while I'm not a big bar person generally, I'm particularly less bar-ish before noon. Perhaps it was being isolated as though I was being made an example of. Maybe it was my time spent puzzling over the decision to alienate a customer after they've barely crossed the threshold of the restaurant. Or maybe it was that I was being treated like I was trying to get into an exclusive nightclub when really it was just a mediocre, overpriced breakfast restaurant. Regardless, it absolutely ruined my visit. I could continue regaling you with my thoughts on this awful experience, but I've got to get back to my busy schedule of studiously avoiding The Breakfast Club for any and all meals for the rest of my life.  Ciao!",

The place seemed relatively busy which I think is always a good sign.   We were seated promptly and our server was at our table shortly after that. We sat outside along Scottsdale Road. It was pretty loud, but it was also great to people watch! I couldn't believe how quickly our food came out! And it was really delicious!   I had the Bird Omelette, which had avocado, turkey, Boursin cheese and mushrooms stuffed inside. My meal also came with pan fried potatoes and huge, fresh hunks of fruit. I couldn't finish, so I saved the fruit and potatoes for later. My Mom ordered a traditional breakfast with bacon, eggs, toast, potatoes and fruit. It was also massive and she said it was very good.   Our server was excellent. She was friendly, prompt and professional. I would recommend this place for anyone looking to people watch and not looking to pay astronomical prices for breakfast in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "TBC has become a bit of a Scottsdale landmark over the past few years...I use it as a navigation landmark when I have people meeting me in town.  \"Go north on Scottsdale Road and if you see 75 hung over people dressed in Affliction tee shirts and sequined mini-dresses, standing on a street corner waiting for a mediocre breakfast, you've gone too far...in so very many ways\".  I live (for another few weeks, at any rate) pretty close to TBC and yet, I don't really \"go to there\" very often (or at all) if I can avoid it.  I just don't look good in Affliction...or a sequined mini-dress.  In addition, the food and service have left me cold (much like my last omelet at TBC a few weeks ago) on my infrequent visits.  But the amusement factor provided by TBC is (for me at least) quite high, and for that, I'm grateful!  I've been twice in the past year...once for lunch, out of renewed curiosity (I was headed to another spot for lunch and saw a couple reading a menu outside another restaurant and discussing their lunch preferences in loud Scottish accents \"I dinna want a fookin TACO, Angela...I wanna go to the fookin Breakfast Club!\").  That was almost a year ago...and I went once for breakfast, recently, because the Beautiful Carin likes TBC.  And what Carin wants, Carin gets!  But both visits featured mediocre food (esp. for the price) and mediocre service (at any price).  My last visit also featured an apparently broken exhaust duct that runs under the booths at the north end of the place.  Hot, humid cooking exhaust, coming up through the seams in the upholstery, steamy cooking aroma's wafting around me from below...I was about to call Guinness because I thought I was setting a new world record for sustaining a fart!  But the aromatic breeze didn't stop!   And even though I'm close to senility, I eventually realized that it wasn't me!  Our server was uninterested in this turn of events (when I let her know what was happening)...apparently I'm past the age when a 22 year old \"model\" (who happens to be slingin' hash) needs to pay any attention to me...even when they are theoretically being paid to do so!  Maybe she wasn't being paid enough to listen to me...that's probably why some hookers get $2-3,000 an hour...to listen...bareback.  At any rate, I was going to add a star to my review, since the warm air enema felt so darn nice, but what other restaurant can compete with that?  It wouldn't be fair!  TBC is clearly a club that doesn't need me as a member, and I'm OK with that.",

Even a restaurant named \"Bacon\" had more vegetarian options.   Not sure why this place draws the crowds anymore, it just doesn't stack up.",

On Saturday, I attempted to go with my husband and 2 friends - and the hostesses wouldn't seat us.   My friend and I got there and were told of a 30-40 minute wait. As we were waiting for our husbands to join us, this was no problem for us. Then..they got there, and we still weren't seated. When I went to check with the hostess, my name had been crossed off list. Now, we were waiting by the front door, but I know my name was never called. I was kind, understanding that mistakes are made, and I was informed that we would be seated next.   She then proceeded to seat a group of our size that had arrived after us. I went back up to the hostess station and demanded to know why people who had arrived long after us were being seated before us. The hostess lied to me, telling me that she hadn't told me we were to be seated next, but that we were just \"coming up.\"   I was shocked that I was getting the runaround, so I took the news back to my group, and as we were discussing whether or not to leave, the hostess seated ANOTHER group of our size that had just arrived instead of us. At this point we got up to leave. The hostess, seeing we were leaving, said \"you know you guys are coming up.\" Whether that was a taunt or what I will never know, but I do know that I will never go there again.   It was ridiculous to be treated like a second class citizen while trying to get breakfast. I would rather eat at Denny's, which I loathe, as I know they will at least seat and serve me.",

    "text": "We came upon this place accidentally through yelp....and are sooo happy we did.  While there seems to always be a long wait....20-30 minutes both mornings we came, it is worth it.  Though I'd have to say that our first experience was WAY BETTER than our second, though it was extraordinarily busy that second time.   As a first timer I was overwhelmed with my delicious choices.... though my husband quickly narrowed my options claiming that one of us was going to get the french toast and the other the omelet.  Being that I'm more of a savory than sweet person, I picked an omelet--within his \"no red meat or pork limitations\" in mind.  I opted for the Bird:  turkey, mushroom, and boursin cheese with sliced avocado on top.    When breakfast came, we were beyond drooling and ready for our feast.  I immediately smeared a little cream cheese on my everything toasted bagel and took a bite...not a new york bagel, but this is az.  Then I turned my attention to the omelet....overfilled with freshly shaved thick cuts of moist turkey!!! I almost didn't want to share, but luckily it was big enough, and with the bagel and all ;)   Next to the omelet were their O'Brien potatoes...omg, the tri-colored roasted peppers sauteed with the potatoes were full of fresh bright flavors; these I refused to share!  There were also three or four big hunks of fruit on the plate, though I never got to the healthy stuff.  My husband, as promised, ordered the Cinnamon Challah French toast.  He enjoyed it, though I found the thickness of the bread to be lacking completely.  Being a Jew from New York, I have partaken in many a Challah french toasts and the thickness is of vital importance...1 1/2 to 2\" thick is perfect...you get the soft, eggy fluffiness of the center and the crispy buttery crunch on the outside....with a thin cut peice of challah...your missing the eggy fluffiness, and it sometimes just gets limp under the syrup; which it did.  The candied nuts and fruit, however, make up a little bit for that limpness, as it added texture!  Overall, we felt we would return, and even did the next day.  And while the service and food were not as good as the first time; ~~when is it ever?  We'd still return!",

I got bacon but it was over done, burnt and dry. It came with cut large cut pieces of assorted fruit which as very much welcomed.  The busboys I think make the place happy.  They were always really polite and never reached without asking.  Most of the staff were either groggy (it is the morning I can understand that) or just not happy to be there.  I asked where the restroom was and a server bascially looked at me, looked at the direction to go, pointed and turned her back to me.  I asked a general question to managment and he directed someone else to answer it for me.  I felt a little offended by this gesture.  The food is good but I will say it would be nice to have staff that are bit more oriented towards customer service.",

Fortunately, the Breakfast Club was just a few blocks down from our hotel. As soon as my friend and I arrived, we were seated right away on the patio. Service was prompt and friendly with none of the small chit chat. We were shocked at how cheap everything was.. breakfast entrees under $10 on vacation?? Unheard of unless you're eating at McDonalds or some other fast food place. I ended up ordering the egg white scramble with cottage cheese and fresh fruit and a glass of fresh carrot juice. I'm not a carrot juice fan but I thought what the heck let's try this. WOW! It was amazing! I didn't know carrot juice could taste so good and sweet by itself. I'm definitely hooked on carrot juice now! The food itself was really good. For the price, we were served pretty big portions and nothing tasted too oily or greasy to weigh me down. I especially liked the fruit selection which were slices of juicy watermelon, cantalope and pineapple - not the typical bowl of pathetic looking grapes and banana slices at other restaurants. I highly recommend the Breakfast Club to kick start your day in Scottsdale!",

But the line here is so freaking long during the weekends I just had to try it.  The food is good! Servers are attentive and friendly, food and drinks come out at precisely the right moment (not too soon, not too late) and portions are pretty big. Ingredients are fresh and some of the dishes are creative. I've been here twice and have had a crab benedict and a build-your-own omelet (which includes choices of like a billion different veggies/meat and cheeses... i couldn't believe how many cheeses there were written on the board... what is it, ten? twelve? Heaven!) The crab benedict had more crab than I expected... maybe twice as much! Real crab, too, not \"krab\" although I'm not sure where it came from (obviously a can but prior to that, where did this come from?)  The menu has a LOT of choices. My only drawbacks are the long wait (we have been told \"about 40 minutes\" and that turned into \"about 35 minutes\" after the first 40 were up), but this is a breakfast place after all, and while I do expect to wait, I don't like waiting twice. Also, there is no booze here. Granted, I probably don't NEED it... but if I had it, I would not feel that they should drop menu prices by about $1 or $2.",

The french toast was stale with about 5 berries on top, and their omelet had about 12 eggs in it and you had to surf through it to find the other ingredients. The waitress developed her personality from a car crash I think. There are two many other great places in Scottsdale to go for a better price and quality. Don't waste your money.",

Oh and the W has no other breakfast options unless you feel like eating at Sushi Roku, yuck.  The bad news? You'll likely have a bit of a wait and as far as breakfast places go, it's not that remarkable. Sure the eggs and bacon were fine, but nothing about this place says: kick ass breakfast.   My friend and I were seated at the communal table. There was another random group of 2 seated at the other end. Two of my other friends tried to join us mid-meal (there were plenty of seats at the communal table) and were denied. The hostess said something about us dominating the communal table, not sure what that was supposed to mean but it sure was annoying.",

We were sat at a table in approximately 35 minutes and greeted quickly. Our waitress was nice and the food arrived in a timely manner. I had the biscuits and gravy and my husband had a caprese salad. Both were absolutely fantastic. The food was fresh, served at appropriate temperatures and seasoned perfectly. Now I understand why they are so busy! The prices are very reasonable as well.

It has not stopped the speed that kitchen works though!  I've been 3 times in recent months, and my food came out very quickly.  I'm giving this place a 3 because I probably will go back, but I was not happy with the way they do the wait list.  It appeared to me that they were discriminating on people based on the descriptions that they wrote down about each party.  I stood there and watched them for a while pick over some parties and then pick others with the same number of guests in the parties.  It was a little weird.  I want to believe that they were not doing that.  So, perhaps I need to get there on teh weekend at 8am or whatever time they open so I don't have to witness that.  Anywhoot, The Whole Hog is my favorite thing on that menu if you want to venture off the beaten path into the artery clogging.  When I have ventured into the high saturated fat realm, I have definitely enjoyed that option!!!",

    "text": "I know The Breakfast Club has been here since at least a year or two before I moved from AZ (which was a little over 3 years ago) and I never tried it until this past week when I was in town for the Holidays.  I can remember many a Saturday & Sunday mornings being driven back to Old Town (often times by my mother) to retrieve my car from the night before and always debating on grabbing a hangover breakfast here, but I never did.  Anyways, I came here for lunch and I really liked it.  Apparently this place has had a pretty extensive renovation recently and is quite a bit bigger than it once was.  It was crowded and we had a bit of wait for a table (and this was on a Tuesday).  From what I understand this is often times the case here.  One of the reasons this place never really tickled my fancy is because something about it just always seemed pretentious for whatever reason, but that's not the case at all.  Sure, the decor is nicer than Denny's but it's still pretty comfortable.  Both the the breakfast & lunch menus sounded delicious & hearty.  I was surprised.  The portions were big & there was several options.   I decided to go w/a lunch option (the grilled chicken sandwich), and it was delicious.  It came w/sweet potato fries, which were good.  Between the sandwich and the fries there was quite a bit of food on my plate for only about $8.  Most of the breakfast & lunch items are around &10 and under.    Even though this place isn't pretentious like I thought it would be when I ordered a diet coke our waitress informed me that they only have \"natural soda in bottles.\"  However, I'm giving brownie points because as the waitress was telling me this she rolled her eyes (not at me, but at how ridiculous that is).    Overall, I really enjoyed Breakfast Club and it's a solid breakfast and/or lunch option in Scottsdale.",

You can sit there and order coffee while you wait for your table (if they are busy). Also, the hot regular coffee is to DIE FOR! I am usually picky about coffee but this one really hit the spot.   Both times I ordered the lean & green omelet, which came with a side of fruit and potatoes. I was able to make two changes to my omelette with no problems. Everything in that dish was SO yummy and tasty! The omelette was fabulous, and the potatoes were made with red & green pepper and I loved it!   I'm sad to read some of the other reviews, so I suppose we were lucky to get very nice waitresses both times!   I would love to go back and order some waffles or pancakes.

    "text": "I was really looking forward to eating here - close walking distance to everything in Old Town Scottsdale and Scottsdale Fashion Square, and always a big crowd - but was a bit disappointed.  With better eggs and service, this place would easily get at least four stars.  Wait: We actually scored a table really quickly, but if we had arrived five minutes later we probably would've had to wait 30 minutes.  Food: My wife got the Quick Start (2 eggs, bacon, toast, and fruit) and I got BC's B&G (jalapeno biscuits and sausage gravy with fontina, 2 eggs, and fruit.  At a breakfast place, making eggs is a huge element and The Breakfast Club failed us here.  Her eggs were undercooked (runny whites) and my eggs were overcooked (almost totally solid yolks when I ordered over-easy).  That aside, everything else was very good.  Covering jalapeno biscuits with eggs, fontina, and gravy was a very interesting combo and (aside from the egg fiasco) tasted very good - rich without being overwhelming.  I'd probably opt to have the eggs on the side or just forego them completely since they weren't really necessary.  What really impressed me was how fresh and sweet the fruit was - especially for March.  Service: While the hostess was nice, the service itself was far from good.  Our waitress seemed new, like a deer in headlights, and the place definitely seemed understaffed.  She came by very infrequently, and actually disappeared when we were ready for a check (maybe she went on a break?).  Fortunately - after waiting for some time - another waitress helped us and brought our check by.",

We loved the huevos con masa, the cornbread was delicious. The French toast was some of the best I have ever had! Panacake was good but French toast much better. Orange juice was a little bitter maybe due to season.",

It was sort of crowded at 8 am, but we didn't have to wait, we were seated right away.  Service was certainly faster than I had anticipated! Our orders were taken quickly and our food was ready shortly after. I ordered the wild mushroom omelette with no dairy on it, and the server accommodated, confirmed I didn't want any dairy. Unfortunately the main thing, the omelette, was bad. Very disappointing, the four stars are because everything else was amazing! My omelette was drowning in butter. Like disgusting amounts of butter. I specifically asked for no dairy and instead it had like 3 times the butter it needed, not even exaggerating! Luckily the breakfast potatoes were the bomb and the fruit was fresh and delicious. My boyfriend enjoyed his food as well! He had eggs and didn't complain about his being super buttery. So if I come back I just won't get an omelette!",

Usually, when I'm hungover food tastes extra amazing, so that doesn't bode well for this place because I left feeling underwhelmed. The omelet was just okay, nothing special, same with the potatoes it came with. I didn't even touch the fruit. 2 small glasses of OJ ran me $8 bucks!   All things considered I've had better omelets at Denny's and at a cheaper price so I probably won't be back.",

Wait has never been more than a few minutes to get a seat. Some mornings I have the \"quick start\" (2 eggs/bacon/fruit /toast) The pancakes are wonderful too, The yogurt with fruit and granola is excellent (and healthy!) My downfall is the biscuit with sausage gravy. (I just get the side) it's sinfully good. The wait staff are super fast and remarkably good looking (I am a 70 y.o.female) One waitress in particular (I believe her name is Alex?? No name tag) Beautiful girl and fantastic waitress. My son has joined me one morning (after hiking Camelback) and had the traditional Benedict. He loved it too,",

The service at the front desk was marvelous-the young hosts were cheerful and eager to greet my guests and I. 5 stars to the front desk.  Our server Kelsey asked what we (4 of us) would be drinking - girlfriend answered \"water,\" 1 of my guests answered \"water\" and before I or my friend could say anything -server walks away. Eventually we get to order drinks when she comes back.  Shortly after, we all order our food. The wait for the food was short! Wonderful. The food comes out- server approaches the table-not to ask if we are enjoying our meal-if everything is delicious-no the server came to the table to bring us our check and ask how we're splitting it. It came across as impolite to all of us. No one asked for the check, so I asked her to take it off the table. We just receive our meals and the serve is already trying to flip the table? It ruined the experience. Server did not inquire at any point if we were enjoying things.  I had ordered the Huevos En Masa but server ordered me Huevos Rancheros instead. I'd never been there so I didn't realize and I ate it. When the check came out was when I saw.  We were visiting from across the country. We wanted to enjoy brunch and the service at the table disappointed each of us. I would come again to give the place another chance - but a very disappointing first time eating there.",

The best thing about this place was their service once your seated. Our waitress attended my sister and I very quick. I order the lean & green omelette with turkey sausage. Overall it's was decent. It had a ton of veggies which I enjoyed. Portion size was good. Came with potatoes and fruit. The fruit addition was different but I really enjoyed it. Overall it was a 3 for me I felt like the food could have been a little bit better in regards to my omelette. But I would recommend this place so that you can try it out for yourself and make your own decision. Some reviews were iffy but you really don't know until you come here for yourself.",

This place really knows how to serve a full portion meal for a great price.  I recommend trying any one of the omelets as well because they are big, fluffy, and full of great ingredients.  Everything on the menu seems to come with fruits and potatoes (which come with the best green, yellow, and red peppers ever).

I'm really glad I suggested it because it was delicious. I arrived around 1 pm (they close at 3 pm) on a gorgeous Saturday, so I wasn't upset when I was told I couldn't be seated until my dining companion joined me. There are chairs outside to sit in while you wait and it was so nice out, I relished the opportunity to bask in the sunshine. When I mentioned my friend had just arrived and was parking her car, the hostess sat me in a cozy booth inside. Definitely make sure everyone in your party is there so you can be seated right away. Our waitress was really nice and helpful and paid just the right amount of attention to us.  I do wish The Breakfast Club had alcohol because a mimosa on a sunny Saturday would have made the day perfect, but alas they do not have alcohol. My friend enjoyed her green iced tea and my black hot tea was fine. My friend had the Nutty Belgian Waffle (she added berries on the recommendation of our waitress), which filled the entire plate and looked quite yummy. I had the four cheese omelet which was divine! None of the four cheeses overpowered the other and when I cut into the omelet, the cheeses were hot and gooey...yum! The potatoes and peppers that came on the side were good and I left feeling contently full.  For our two drinks, two entrees, and a side of bacon, our bill came to $30 before tip which I thought was very reasonable for a breakfast establishment. I can't wait to go back to try some more items, although hopefully next time I can score a table on the patio.",

(PS:  Anyone with insider info on my theory, please offer clarification)  The bacon and sausage is amazing breakfast meaty goodness. Cinnamon Challah French Toast is pure bliss. Anything of the Mexican persuasion, gastronomically speaking, is fantastico. The brewed coffee is unparalleled...seriously.",

The space is huge now and so warm and inviting. The traditional eggs benedict is to die for as well as their potatoes. Not to mention their fruit. I swear they have a farm out back and pick it fresh. Probably one of the best places for breakfast in AZ.",

    "text": "Yummy food when you can get it. It's typically packed for brunch - especially on the weekends. Most of the girls that work there are hot and young... that doesn't make them the best waitresses, but they are usually nice.   The atmosphere isn't anything terribly special - it's basically just the place to go to be seen and people watch. It's full of the same douchebags and plastics that went out the night before - they still look like their hair gel and guyliner is holding up and their designer shirt maybe has one or two extra wrinkles. The ladies seldom look like they left the house unshowered or without makeup. Mostly pretty people anyway... I always feel like a disgusting mess when I'm there because I just roll out of bed and go dirty.  The food is fairly delicious, but I think it's pretty difficult to fuck up breakfast. It's not excessively greasy though which is nice... There are many breakfast favorites that serve greasy meals. Their standard eggs, bacon, fruit, bread, and hashbrowns is very light as well as filling. Their omlettes are slightly above average.   It can also be rather inexpensive here which is nice for the $30,000/year millionaires. It can also be fairly pricey depending on what you get... it's the drinks - that's where they get you. They are priced like mixed drinks, but it's just orange juice or coffee.   The problems with this place are that it's tough to find a seat, you have to keep your appetite while eating around douchers, and there are half a dozen other breakfast places within a few miles of it that are as good if not better. I do like this place though and I'll continue to go... food is 4 stars, ambience is 3, service is 3.5... this place really gets a 3 and a half. Go check it out.",

Large plates with decent-sized portions, potatoes O'brien are great addition to each item, and the fresh fruit is a refereshing change from standard breakfast fruit portions, large and full of watermelon, canteloupe, and pineapple. My personal favorite is the The Bird Omelette. Great food, service is normally decent, but not great, but always left Breakfast Club satisfied.",

Plus it was very very noisy, we literally had to yell at each other to hear ourselves plus ...Just the fact they did not know what the ingredients was in their bread, and many of their ingredients come pre-packaged not made from scratch....is not good....there are better places in old town,,,which have organic food offerings and they know what they are serving, unlike the breakfast club.......If you have food allergies avoid this place!!!",

Their portions are big, their prices are not bad for a trendy brunch restaurant, and their staff is friendly.   A few of my favorites:  *The Bird omelet: I don't get the cheese or mushrooms, you don't need it since the avocado makes it really creamy  *Turkey Benedict: a fun twist, and their turkey is like Thanksgiving turkey...delicious  *Jalapeno Biscuits & Sausage Gravy: a little kick and ends up solidifying in your stomach...in a good way  *Breakfast Burrito: PLEASE try it with the chorizo queso on top...it might have changed my life  *Bagel & Lox: really fresh and just the right amount of salty   Things I don't love (and there are just a few):  *The wait can be a biatch, especially if it's really hot outside (there are only so many shaded areas to stand)  *The coffee bar is nice because you don't have to wait until seated to get a caffeine fix, however the wait is long, the space is cramped, and it's pricey  *Their Potatoes O'Brien are delicious but have way more bell peppers than actual potatoes, and it's a pretty small serving  *The crowd can be a bit obnoxious, but it's part of the fun of the whole experience...it's fun to judge others over a yummy brunch",

The atmosphere was nice and the wait staff was friendly.  I decided to order the omelet with crab.  I'm usually very cautious about doing so in places that are not near the water (I'm from Baltimore after all) and it was surprisingly good and as was the fruit and potatoes.  My boyfriend who is self described as a tea snob loved that our looseleaf tea was served in a metal tea pot, which I seriously considered taking with us because it was so cool.    On the downside, we did feel a little out of place given we had so many curious stares from customers, but I'll chalk it up to us being clearly not from around here.    I'd definitely recommend this place to others and would probably visit every so often if I lived here.  I do really love the healthy options on menu and will plan to give it a try again.",

The steak, was tender, and made just as ordered, alone with the side items, potatoes, etc.  In addition the staff was very attentive, from the hostest, to the servers.

I played it safe and went with a break fast sandwich and a side of fruit. Fruit, A-ok. Sandwich, dry english muffin, over cooked egg (i wasn't even asked how i wanted it) A LOT of cheese, which is great because i love cheese more than anything - but even i thought it was a little over kill. I can't even remember if there was meat on the sandwich now that i think about it.

There's a bit of a wait but apparently you can call ahead to get your name on the list, something that shortened our wait considerably. Our coffee and fresh squeezed orange and grapefruit juices came very quickly and were a great start. I'm an Eggs Benedict fan and wasn't in a particularly adventurous mood so the Traditional Bene was perfect, with the hollandaise not too bland or too sour like some places. My friend also raved about her Quick Start Conscious breakfast. The waitress was efficient but not obtrusive. I'd definitely eat here again and am planning on trying one of the Southwestern specialties next time.",

But Breakfast Club and a few other breakfast joints around the US are on my exceptions list; if I have a guest visiting over Saturday, I make it a point to each brunch with them here.  First off, the food is great. It's really good. The steak is always done well, the waffles slightly sweet, the fruit fresh, the ingredients, awesome. I've had most of their menu and I can honestly say, it's all good. Some better than others, but all are good. If it's your first time visiting, go with the Cinnamon Challah French Toast (the fruit is so delicious) and their Mignon Benedict Style Eggs. If you can and are willing, go for their fresh juice, a treat. Also try the Mimosa. One of the reasons I'm a fan of this place, is the ingredients are very fresh and they don't saturate everything with tons of baking soda and powder. I can taste these things, and they don't use a ton of it.  The staff isn't always nice, sometimes rude; however, I'm ok with this, as all I want is for them to come when I signal and to keep my water glass filled at all time (which if you're unlucky you might end up with someone who can't do that).  Still, I'm a fan. I'm not a fan of breakfast and brunch, but for this place, I can atleast leave feeling like I've eaten something that doesn't give me a headache. For breakfast, I'm a fan.",

I decided the get \"The Bird\" which is an omelet with Turkey, avocado, mushrooms and Boursin cheese. The plate also came with delicious potatoes and fresh fruit. The portions were huuuuge so I'm glad I didn't cave and get the side of pancakes too. Ouch, that would've been painful.

We had several in our party with specific dietary needs and the staff was most accommodating and helped us make the necessary adjustments ... the meals were delicious.  Our only complaint was the noise level of the traffic for the outside seating. We'd've tried inside but it was too warm in there and the traffic was the lesser of two evils",

Every table has a bowl of sweetener on the table?!?!!\" says me.  \"Oh, that is for the coffee. He says it would upset too many people if we took it away. But you can go next door, and buy a diet there, then bring it over here if you like\"  WTF?!?! Sure I'll go over there, next door every time I want a refill  So this guy takes his stand with diet soda? Does he have any clue what is in regular soda?!?! Hell, diet or anything else, it is all bad for you. But I want a diet and the owner won't serve it  Way to take a stance on such an important issue genius..

They have a delish assortment of breakfast, brunchy and lunchy items. I love their french toast with challah bread. They also make an incredible grilled cheese. Only complaint: the tomato soup leaves something to be desired, it's over-peppered and hard to eat.  The service is always great and the staff is extremely peppy and professional. Naomi Garnice gives it four stars!",

I've tried several things on the menu that are meat free-some better than others. Love their omelettes! Yum. The Bello Bene is so-so, I'm a huge fan of portabella mushrooms but I think it was the Bourdelaise sauce that threw me off. I've ordered the quick start breakfast as well, and the only thing that irks me is getting charged extra to sub out the meat for potatoes. WTH?   I like that they have a coffee bar, an option that I have not yet taken advantage of-due to it being far too much work to think of a fancy coffee drink I would like when I'm not fully awake.   Service wise, I've never had an issue. The waitstaff is always friendly and I've never waited a really long time for food.   Overall, it's a great place to grab standard breakfast fare and I predict many more visits to BC in my future.",

I had a standard 2 eggs and toast and it was as good as I'd expect 2 eggs and toast to be.

The potatoes were nicely browned and were not greasy and the fruit was sweet and tasty. My boyfriend ordered a pancake and said it was the best he's had in quite a while.

I must say, I do like this location and the Breakfast Club as a whole but I do prefer their other location. This one is much louder and has more of a cafe vibe to it and is more open. It is also quite a bit more loud, seeing as you are right next to the road. Other than that, it's very nice! The wait was not too bad for 2 people in June, about 10 minutes. We had the nuts and berries waffle, eggs Benedict, and Lox and Cream cheese. The waffle was light and fluffy and had delicious, ripe berries as well as candied nuts. My partner said that the eggs Benedict was alright, but nit his favorite. He much preferred the Lox and Cream cheese and I have to say I agree. The salmon is very nice, it has a light smoky flavor that is perfect on a bagel with cream cheese and capers. Our waitress was very courteous and the rest of the wait staff was helpful, and ready to clear plates. Overall, I was satisfied with my experience here and would recommend it. But if you are able to, get yourself on the wait list as this is one of the most popular brunch spots in the Valley!",

When our table became available,the hostess refused to seat us, (our colleague was parking), until \"she walked through the door.\" There were people seated in our stead, that had arrived after us.  It was too late to change this site, as we all had driven from different valley hospitals. Our colleague arrived momentarily and then we were seated. Our waitress was sweet and attentive. The food was not anything out of the ordinary, but that was not the focus of the breakfast. As we sat discussing work issues after our breakfast, a woman arrived and offered us a glass of water or ice tea for our departure. I thought , \"What great customer service!\"  This woman was the manager.  It was not customer service at all. The manager was \"kicking us out\" of the restaurant! She said there was a \"90 minute time limit for having your meal with ample time for conversation.\"  I asked if this policy was displayed on the menu or anywhere and she said it was not.  She explained she wanted to give \"everyone an opportunity to eat at this restaurant that was waiting to be seated\".   In my entire life, at breakfast, lunch or dinner, have I, or my colleagues ever been asked to leave a table until we were ready to depart!!!   This is a shameful display of unprofessionalism.  Can you imagine this scenario in other place of business?  A hospital? Dentist? Dealership? I could go on and on!!!  Well, to the Breakfast Club, we are giving you our seats. We will NEVER set foot in your restaurant again. I will be glad to share my experience in the future with anyone asking my opinion.  Leadership should lead by example....   Shame on you!",

The vibe here is excellent and the place is always filled with a fun group of people.  The service is always done with a smile and a sense of urgency.  They really do care about your experience.  You must go to this place!!!  Cheers!",

You think I'm full? I'm not. Get a waffle on the side to share with the table. It's literally the best tasting waffle I've ever had. And I've had a lot of waffles. Add strawberries, you won't be sorry. Beverages: tea is good (I'm a ice tea drinker so I know) mimosa is better. Fresh OJ. Average Scottsdale prices. Everything I just mentioned minus the mimosa and splitting with waffle with one person was $24 including tip. Only negative is the inside is always loud on those mornings when your nursing a hang over and outside is a lil hot. They really need to work on that. Jk they can't control the climate.",

We were sat outside on the patio and quickly greeted by our server. She was very attentive and her whole demeanor was very easy going and friendly. I got a regular eggs Benedict which was awesome!  The only thing was that when I went to the restroom a bird came by and started picking at my food. When I came back the server apologized and was very nice. The bird issue isn't something that the restaurant can control, but a piece of advice would be to have shades on the patio area so the bird won't have as easy of access swooping in.",

My husband had the Border Bowl and it was full of flavor, every bite a little different. I think it became his go to dish. The Huevos Con Masa has a lot of flavor but had only one texture, it could have used some crunch.   All the juices are fresh, the salty dog with fresh Grapefruit juice was perfectly balanced. Coffee was good. There is typically a long wait, you can put your name on the list via Yelp or in person.

    "text": "I have been going to the Breakfast Club for years and it has pretty much always been the same. Always busy, higher priced breakfast items, subpar service and a lot of hungover and boozy patrons. I used to like it a lot more before they rebranded. Seems a little more like a club atmosphere on the weekends. Arrive early to get a seat!   The last time I visited I got the lox and cream cheese plate which was pretty good. Just what I had expected and was in the mood for that morning. My husband got the Huevos Rancheros and it was tasty but wayyyy to heavy on the beans.   There are other places I would choose over The Breakfast Club, but they must be doing something right to be as busy as they are!",

I had the ham and eggs which includes two slices of ham, your choice of eggs, potatoes O'Brien and your choice of toast. I had two slices of toast, but it is not shown in this picture because they forgot to give the toast. I had to ask about the toast and I asked it to go because by the time I asked about it, I was already halfway through out the meal, so I had it to go. The toast was really good. I got sourdough and one toast was really chewy and the other toast was on the toastier side as it was really crunchy. I am more a fan of chewy toast. I went here at 1pm an hour before closing. I did not have to wait at all and was seated right away.",

I'm not much of a breakfast person or breakfast out but I know if I bring someone here they'll like it.   Food was good. Latte with extra hot coconut milk took a long time. Server apologized before I asked about it and got it removed from the bill without me asking. Much appreciated.   They're very accommodating with special requests too.   I'm giving them a 4 rather than a 5 because I think the plates could use a garnish. Also, back in the day, before they remodeled, there was a homier feel to the place, but it still felt cool. It's a little more upscale now. If I do go out for breakfast I prefer a smaller, cozier environment...but if you go, I know you'll like it.",

    "text": "We were planning on making an entire day of old town, Scottsdale. We had been a few times before but hadn't t properly explored in full detail. We knew we wanted breakfast but we weren't sure where we wanted to go. Of course, it was prime-time, post-church, brunch rush-hour. We were lucky enough to find the perfect parking spot, and as good karma would bring us - there was a hostess who told us there was a 35 to 45 minute wait at least, but if I could find seats at the breakfast bar they were first come, first serve. I looked over and there were two seats. I sprinted over there and put my purse down on the seat my fiance would sit in. He was still parking the car. We were greeted by our server right away. My fiance wanted lunch, so he ordered the Rueben with fries. I opted for two eggs over medium with breakfast meat and then also a blueberry pancake made with corn bread mix. We waited a pretty long time to get our food, but it was very busy so we expected that. When our food came out, my fiance's sandwich was served in a wrap. He asked, \"is that the Rueben?\" She said \"Yes!\" very confidently. He took a few bites and even though it was good, he opened up the wrap to see that it was turkey and lettuce. It was really a turkey wrap. My eggs were overcooked and the pancake was the worst thing I've ever tasted in my life. It was so dry I felt like I was eating cardboard with a few berries on top of it. Finally a different server came over and my fiance said that he ordered the Rueben. He wasn't going to have them make another one and bring it back out but he just wanted to let them know that the order came out wrong and it wasn't what he wanted. Also, my bacon was heavily under cooked so I gave it back to them to put back in. It came back out looking exactly the same. The prices are affordable and they did take the Rueben off the check which was really great.The whole thing was a mess and needless to say, my fiance and I will not be going back. There's a lot of other great breakfast spots in the area, so I would try to make a reservation at one of those.",

Regardless, I ordered an iced coffee this time around and it was delightful.   I ordered the Lean & Green Omelette to try to stay on the lighter side. It was yummy and the fruit tasted fresh, but I wouldn't say it was anything special. I think their tastiest menu items are their Mexican inspired dishes.

I fresh cut turkey which was seared with mild spice along with scrambled egg whites, 2 slices of 9 grain toast with a light coating of butter, it also came along with O'Brien potatoes which were seared in the skillet and very fresh.  My selection also came with a side of fruit melons.  The to go packing is very upscale and sturdy!  The quality of the food was excellent, I will be returning to this place on. My next visit to the area.  The serving was huge, I saved the other portion for a late afternoon snack.  The parking is in the rear, street parking is very touch.  There is outdoor seating with comfy modern furniture.  The interior is very tastefully decorated and has an upscale appearance.  The staff is very efficient, courteous and fast moving.",

He said everything was good. And actually made his steak the way he likes it. I ordered the French toast. So nice 3 huge slices I loved that it didn't come with all the extra stuff like eggs bacon .. just a side of fresh fruit. It was so yummy.. our waitress didn't bring the maple syrup. I had to ask another server to bring it over. So the only down side here is the service it seems they are so busy having their own conversations and not really paying that much attention to the customer. Im sure we Probably come back bc the food was super yummy ...we can get over the service for some bomb breakfast.",

Who doesn't love fresh melon on the plate in December! Also, the fresh squeezed grapefruit juice was absolutely fabulous. Served in a frozen glass made all the difference.

They were cooked to perfection, but they were placed on top of each other, 2 by 2. As I only eat the yoke, they broke apart and I didn't have enough bread to slop them up. The ham was phenomenal.

I had a visitor in town, so I wanted to see what all the hype was all about.  The place is kind of small, so it has partial explanation of why it is so busy.  We came on Presidents Day, and I forgot that many people would have the day off.  The wait wasn't horrible, as we waited about 30 minutes.  While we were waiting, we had an opportunity to buy some coffee at the coffee bar.    As we entered, the interior looked very busy.  There was a long table where we sat, and there was another couple sitting on the other edge of the table.  This is the first time I have shared seats with some one at a restaurant.  I ordered mushroom eggs benedict that came with potatoes.  My friend ordered a chocolate chip Belgian Waffle.  My food was good with decent portion, but my friend just got one small waffle for $8.  You could have gotten 6 Eggo Waffles for $4.  The quality is not comparable, but it doesn't make sense why she did not get eggs or potatoes.  We had a tough hike ahead, and it wasn't enough food.  I gave her the potatoes to fill up extra carbs and starch.    I would come here again, but I don't think it lives up to the hype or long waits.",

The portions are large which is great if you are starving or hung over but I wish they had some of their larger items like the omelets ala cart.  I love their a la cart breakfast sandwich, it's like an adult egg McMuffin with horseradish sauce on it.  I don't love the price.  At over $5 for just a sandwich I'll head to across the canal to Olive and Ivy's market and get a sandwich and home fries for $7.  And if you like pancakes?  O....M....G!  I have found a couple things there that aren't wallet busters if you just want a quick bite to eat.  Their 2 eggs anyway are $2, spend $0.50 to add cheese and you have a filling but cheap meal for under $3.  The portion size is more like 3-4 eggs instead of two when you get them scrambled.  If you want to look at the menu ahead of time, don't bother with their online one.  It's out dated and most of their items have risen in price $1-3.  The other bad news is they don't have an alcohol licenses so no mimosas or bloody mary's with your breakfast.  Womp Womp :(",

My husband got the bird omelet which I tasted and YUCK.  It was completely bland.  He had to pour hot sauce all over it for flavor.  They put the eggs right on top of the fresh cold fruit so that now you cant eat it or wouldnt want to eat it.  If they just read their own reviews they would stop doing that.  Talk about dumb asses.  I got the huevos rancheros with green chili.  It comes in an open chipotle tortilla that is MINUS any taste.  Its swimming in juices which is making the tasteless tortilla into glue.  Comes with two eggs on top.  The flavors together were just not that good.  Got a $4 glass of fresh squeezed orange juice that made my face scrunch up because of the bitterness.  Waitress brought bill way too early obviously trying to get rid of us but that just pisses me off even further cuz thats her ticket to not having to do shit.  I waived that bitch down anyway.  I want water bitch.  The only reason they get 2 whole stars is because the green chili was good otherwise hate this place :-)",

The food is great, but the wait can be long unless you call in advance. If you think you will be coming call 30 minutes in advance, so then you will likely get a table by the time you get there. If you can't call ahead you can always go straight to the bar.",

I've ordered breakfast on two occasions here and both times it came out cold, plus the order was messed up.   The outdoor patio on the side street is nice but the Scottsdale Road side gets quite noisy with the traffic.  Wait staff and hostesses are nothing fabulous, not overly friendly considering the price and the wait.

But there are others in old town scottsdale that are unfortunately better. I've been here 2-3x and have gotten the french toast, huevos rancheros and the biscuits and gravy. Everything was delicious and the staff is always extremely friendly. It's a good breakfast/brunch spot but for me, the hype is way more than I'd give it. Hence the 4 stars",

I stated no we are all her and my 2 yr old was standing beside me at the table. she again stated well if your incomplete you will have to get up and wait till your party is complete. I again stated we are a family of 4 we are all here and have already ordered our beverages. with a soul on her face and a raised tobe she stated I didn't need to be so rude she was just doing her job. no apology for the misunderstanding or anything. I asu med ahe was a hostess and stated as she stormed off I would like to speak with the manager. she then turned and shouted I am the manager. our nice waitress came and she apologizes and stated there is a second manager I could speak with, again a lady came to our table and just stood there. didnt address us, tell us who she was, or even an apology for the previous misunderstanding. soni expressed to her what happened and she just dismissed it and stated the other person told her that she didn't tell us we would have to leave and wait. I asked for general manager and was told she would not give that info to me either but I could leave my info which we all know what happen to that...I will not gontonthe location again that being said the food is good and service is outstanding but dont get up off your seat or they get very upset. I will patron the downtown location from now on.",

There was a fairly long wait ~30 minutes and were we seated outside (right along scottdale ave), but it was actually worth it.  my food was ok.  I ordered the bacon and eggs and the oatmeal.  you can't really mess up bacon and eggs, but for some reason, the oatmeal was really good.  my oatmeal that i put in the microwave doesn't taste like that!    but the real highlight was what my fiancee ordered.  she had the cinnamon french toast with toasted nuts and berries.  4 nice slices of heaven with some fresh berries and toasted almonds and pecans.    I can forgive Matt's big breakfast this time, but if i'm ever back in the Phoenix area, they better be open and beat the french toast at the breakfast club.",

    "text": "Went here to celebrate graduation and had the worst possible experience of my life.  We had a group of 5 total. We decided to go have a couple drinks at the bar before being seated.  We ordered 4 mimosas (5 but brother didn't have his ID) which came out to 50 dollars.  Three of us had seats at the bar and two were standing behind.  We were having a great time but after 15 min of sitting there the bartender/waitress comes up to us and says in a rude tone, \"usually we reserve these spaces for people who are eating, would you move over to the waiting area\".   I understand that it was busy and that she wanted to make more money off of new customers but we had ordered a pretty expensive round of drinks and were waiting to get our table to spend more money on food.  It was quite insulting that they would have the nerve to ask us to leave from the bar.  We did not leave and she grunted and left then proceeded to talk shit to the other bartenders only a few feet from us.   Finally we were seated.  We decided to let go of what had happened and still enjoy ourselves.  When we got our food a manager came up to us.  He rudely started telling us that it is illegal for someone without an id to drink from other peoples drinks (my brother) and that two waitresses had told him this was happening.  My brother had not taken one sip from a drink on the table, beisdes his water.  We tried to explain nicely to him that he had not taken a sip, and the manager started to become extremely rude and not listen. He then began  raising his voice and not only interrupting our breakfast but the other patrons that were sitting on the patio as well.  The food was mediocure and the service was horrendous.  Never going back again.  They did not even comp our meal which had turned into a disaster.  What happened to the customer is always right? These people teamed up against us and main my graduation breakfast a horrible experience.",

I recommend a table outside where the sun slowly rises and casts warmth and sunlight on the outdoor seating area. We each ordered coffee and water and we were delighted to find cucumber slices in our water- such a subtle refreshing twist on water! I don't think my coffee cup ever emptied more than half full before the waitress would return with the coffee pot to top it off. My wife ordered pancakes with a mixed fruit topping (added charge) of fresh strawberries and blueberries. I ordered a full order (3 slices) of French toast and although I'm a big eater, I must admit that I found it difficult to eat it all. Perhaps I would have been better to order a la carte and get just 2 slices. Our total bill was $29.76 which is a bit pricey for just 2 coffees and an order each of pancakes and French toast, but given the ambiance and location of the restaurant, we understand that the cost would be a little high. We hope to return again soon!",

It was early in the day and not too warm yet so the misters above us were a little uncomfortable, but bearable.  I'm guessing the locals like to feel cool as much as possible so we didn't say anything about it.    I ordered their Breakfast Grilled Cheese made with hash browns, eggs, bacon, fontina & cheddar cheeses on grilled sourdough bread. It was decadent and quite yummy, but a bit too greasy. Nevertheless, it tasted great and was a large enough portion to share.  My latte was served in a nice glass mug and was made perfectly. The restaurant wasn't real busy at the time and our service was attentive.  All in all, a good meal and I'd venture back to try some other options. It's walking distance from several Old Town hotels so it's a good spot to keep in mind.",

The place was pretty full the whole time we were there. The menu was pretty extensive, with lots of options to choose from. I had a hard time deciding on what to eat because of that. First world problems, haha. I was debating between the 'Tuscan Frittata' and the 'Whole Hog Omelet,' but settled on the latter option. I liked my food especially the fruit, which I found refreshing. For the price, the serving sizes of the meals served here are extremely worth it. I had a bite of some buttermilk pancakes that my friend ordered too and they were light and fluffy perfection w butter and syrup. Everyone at my table enjoyed their food. My boyfriend had the Breakfast Grilled Cheese, but said it was more like a sandwich than a grilled cheese. He meant that he expected it to have more melty cheese and it to be ooey gooey w cheese like most grilled cheeses are. Nonetheless, he liked his dish. Another person at our table had the Turkey Reuben and said it was yummy. Service was fine as well and the server was nice and pleasant and accommodating. I found out the previous day was BC's 15th anniversary too, so that was cool to know this spot had been around for 15 years. All-in-all, I enjoyed the food and atmosphere. I will definitely return as the breakfasts are well-worth the money w leftovers to bring home too!",

The Scottsdale location on the other hand is literally night and day. Food was okay, although my hash browns were a little burnt. Sitting here waiting for my mom to finish eating and our water cups have been empty for a while, yet she was able to drop off the check? Is your service done now? Like we're still here. Also we were never even asked how our meal was.   Definitely will drive that extra 10 min to go to the Phoenix city scape location.   Update: a busser refilled our water.

This is a popular contemporary diner where you can expect a wait, and correspondingly lots of noise and bustle with the people.  For food I had an omelette and chocolate chip pancake. The chocolate chip pancake was the best thing here and was loaded with chocolate chips inside and out. One on the side was a great deal and a good splurge from my attempting to avoid sugar. On the other hand, the omelette was just average. There were a decent portion of ingredients but it seemed kinda sloppily cooked and the eggs weren't fluffy but had too much of a burnt crispy texture. The side of potatoes was too oily for my taste and unfortunately a lot of oil seeped over to the side of fruit. While the portions are generous, I'd rather have quality over quantity.  Come here for the pancakes and coffee, the proteins are sadly disappointing.",

    "text": "Look back at my reviews. How many 1 stars do you see? None.  And I would have written a lot more reviews lately except I'm about to give up on Yelp due to their lack of action defending businesses against political attacks. But I digress.         The Breakfast Club! Yes, that's why I'm here today.  Never again.    My girlfriend and I both saw the 'Wild mushroom' omelette at the same time and each ordered one.  I'll start with hers.         She asked for some spinach added to hers. It comes out and obviously looks different than mine. No creme fraiche, or cheese. Though she did get the potatoes O'Brien with them.  Okay,  we'll ask about that when the waitress comes back.  After I got her attention, eventually, she explained that there were no substitutions allowed so she wound up with a 'build you're own'. Which meant crimini shromms. Would have been nice to know that adding one ingredient constitutes a 'substitution'.  I'll get back to that in a minute.     My order.  I noticed a lot of water coming out from the folds, and looking inside I saw only crimini mushrooms. Hardly what I would call wild. Certainly were no oyster, shiitake, etc... that were supposed to be there.  I guess if the kitchen wants to substitute unilaterally it's acceptable.      I mentioned this to the waitress and got a blank look.  No explanation, just excuses.  No offer to take it back and fix it. No price reduction. Nothing.         The only reason I didn't walk out is because I was very hungry, so I cleaned my plate. I didn't want to cause a scene that would have embarrassed my girlfriend.     I left 'K' our waitress a dime tip tacked on my bill with a note explaining why. If you are reading this, 'K', please understand that I normally would have left 20% minimum. In cash.     Oh yeah, the coffee was old and bitter too. I can at least relate to that.",

Funny, because he said it was, \"okay.\"  \"Okay\" did not sound like a rave review, but it was our last meal before leaving Scottsdale, my hubby doesn't ask for much, and how can you fail at breakfast?  So, we were there mid week and late in the morning. The restaurant was busy,not full, we opted to eat outside.  I could see how this spot could be popular because of the location and if the food was \"okay,\" even more so.  I suspect that during Spring Training, the boys waited to be seated and felt the rush of people waiting .... But \"okay\" doesn't sound stellar, does it?  Wow. Was I ever impressed!  I ordered the Portobello Eggs Benedict.  Excellent. Hollandaise and Bordelaise sauces?  Why yes, and thank you! Plated beautifully, with fresh fruit and Potatoes O'Brien.  Delish.  The hubs ordered pancakes and they did not disappoint. Accompanying hash brown potatoes were especially yum.  He has a thing about hash browns, and these were tasty.     Our server was friendly and attentive...  Yes, I was totally impressed. So A-Okay!",

Hubby always gets strawberry banana pancakes or bananas foster french toast. I always get the oatmeal with the BC Burro or one of their breakfast sandwiches. Either way, I have ordered other items too, they always seem to satisfy no matter what.   Tips:call ahead to get your name on the list-it used to be no more than 10 minutes, now it's 45, because no matter what there is a wait. We live in chandler, so when we call it's usually when we are exiting because parking is sometimes a pain too. But we've learned a few tricks to get around since we go so much.   Again, no matter what you order it's great, lots of food and the OJ is fresh squeezed. Prices aren't bad either-BC Burro is $5, and it's pretty fatty-in a good way.

That being said, the food here made me ill, literally. My stomach is churning as I write this. I can only assume it is due to the undercooked eggs I was served. After eating half and egg, and bacon, I complained, I nicely explained to my waitress that I was rather grossed out and didn't want a replacement. She took my plate and said she'd talk to the manager. When she returned she explained that the manager had taken $2 off our bill. The manager didn't even come talk to us. I know I could have made a scene but frankly just didn't feel like it. I wasn't even going to write a bad review but now that I am laying here trying not to run to the bathroom, I have changed my mind.  My husband's food seemed fine and as I said the waitress really tried to provide good service in a bad situation that wasn't her fault. Still I will not be back.",

It is the Hugo's (West Hollywood reference) of Scottsdale. Lots of eye candy for boys and girls. The staff is mostly women, and quite the hotties they are. The space is very uncluttered and has great views of the passersbys and cars whippin' down Scottsdale Road. The oatmeal (add blueberries) is fantastic. The breakfast burrito is muy excelente. Orange juice tastes freshly squeezed and the coffee is strong and robust. Just like my Aunt Helen. The place is packed on the weekends, so expect a wait.

I jumped out of the car to find that there would be a 40 minute wait, and we were up for the wait.  I hear that there can be an hour long wait or more at times.  I was already warned about the people who come here seem to be overdressed for brunch, and it was True to their word.  I love that we were there in our exercise and hiking attire.  We did get some coffee from the coffee bar area in the back.  They have excellent coffee here.  If you are a coffee snob, you could fall in love with the java here or some eye candy around you.  There was a healthy stack of papers near the coffee bar, and we waited outside until we were called in for our table.  I was told that we were lucky that we had the nice waitress.  They are all really pretty.  I decided on an eggs benedict a la crab meat style and asparagus.  It was quite delicious.  It had a orange red color sauce with a hint of spicyness to it.  If you are a crab lover like myself, this is something that you would appreciate.  It also came with a side of fruit.  They have very limited outdoor seating and our waitress was pleasant, which I hear is not usually the case.  The prices were reasonable, and I wouldn't mind coming back!",

They have tons of pancakes topped with candied nuts, fruit purees, whipped cream, and even ice cream. Is this really breakfast?! :) They also have a number of healthy options, you can order egg whites, and they have great fresh fruits, oatmeal, and yogurt. I love their toasted bagels and soy lattes. Their lunches are actually really good too... I've had their Turkey Club Wrap and it was great, breakfast is still served all day though. I recommend going early though!

    "text": "My family and I ate here just a few days ago. It was an experience that left me yearning for more out of a restaurant I have seen so crowded over the years and decided to try with a group of 7 of us in the family. First off we got there at 10 am and were missing only two in our party so we had to wait to be seated which was fine. Once the rest of our party showed up at 10:07 we were not seated until after 10:30. When we were seated we were all scrunched together at a medium sized table that would comfortable seat 5 adults. Well, there were 7 of us total and needless to say it was very tight! The waitress stated that we could take our water and go wait back up front for a bigger table but we were looking at roughly 40 minutes of waiting again!!! Seriously? We ordered drinks first and the waitress brought my father his tomato juice and almost spilled it on him but instead spilled it all over her hand. Then she sat the glass down in front of him with juice on table and all over glass and left! She never came back with a wet towel to clean up her mess!! We all ordered and the food arrived quickly. This was the only part of the experience that was good, sadly to say. We received our food order for 7 of us within 15-20 minutes which was excellent. My uncle and grandmother both had charred toast (it was black, not just black around the edges) . The bacon looked like dried strips of hard leather. Overall, none of us will be returning to this place! It was is so overrated. We are headed back to RANDY'S here in Scottsdale to do our next family breakfast.",

    "text": "Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  Moms all over the country for years have woken up to make the meal that breaks the fast of a long nights sleep.  But after a certain age, people forget about breakfast at home and look to other venues to start their day.  A good breakfast place is hard to find.  For the most part, restaurants set a up a line that is too quick to think about quality, and only thinks only of the amount of tables that they can serve, and though that is important, the flavor and prep of the food should not suffer in the process.  The find a restaurant that can do both is rare.  The Breakfast Club is located on Scottsdale Road and Stetson Dr puts forth a valiant effort to bring back quality to an extremely busy establishment.  I've driven by before, and the line on a Sunday morning is out the door.  Upon entering the restaurant, one would see that there is a coffee bar in the back and seating for up to forty people.  There is seating available outside, but on a cold day, there are fewer people wanting the brave a brisk morning then there are fingers on a hand, but I am one of those people.  The friendly greeting from the hostess helped warm the morning, and I was seated immediately to a corner table outside.  The menu is your atypical breakfast place, with foods ranging from the simplicity of the egg to the flavorful complexity is that is a Belgium Waffle topped with just about anything a good breakfast place would offer.  It was definitely a busy morning and the waitress was running around like an organized chicken with her head cut off.  The greeting was friendly as she took my drink order, coffee, and returned quickly with it.  My palate wanted something rich and my stomach wanted something filling, so we all agreed with a Belgium waffle and a side of sausage patties.  I surfed the Internet thinking that with as busy as they are, I would have time to be nerdy and check my fantasy football team.  Oh, how I was wrong.  A vinaigrette bottle, filled with warm, rich maple syrup was brought to the table, and suddenly the food was promptly delivered.  First I took the butter and smothered it on my waffle.  A bad butter can kill a meal, but if I want to see what type of place this is, then I was going to go for it.  The people at the Breakfast Club must have known this, because the butter was fresh and whipped.  I dug into the waffle.  The rich flavors filled my mouth, and the mixture of butter, syrup and waffle brought a smile to my tongue.  Next I took a bite of the sausage patty.  Think and juicy, it was not too greasy as so many places, and was that perfect blend of fat and pork products.  Enjoying every bite, I fully expect to come back again.  The bill was reasonable, and the food lived up to the slightly more than Denny's total.  I felt like I was pay for quality.  You might not want to serve detention on a Saturday, but if you are looking for a nice breakfast with friends, then the Breakfast Club is the place you want to go.  My only recommendation would be get there early, because it will fill up.  But if you have to wait, the food will sing to just for you, \"Don't you forget about me,\" and you won't.",

We arrived just a bit after 8, and only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table.  This food was great!   Being from the south I LOVE biscuits and gravy, so I was excited when I saw BC's B&G (Breakfast Club's Biscuits & Gravy) on the menu.  However I was equally as excited about the Oscar Eggs Benedict.  My server made it easy for me to decide when she told me they were out of the crab meat which is used to make the Oscar.  A few delicious cups of coffee later, my B&G arrived, looking delicious with a side of some perfectly ripe fruit and yummy potatoes.  The B&G is actually jalapeno biscuits, which taste almost doughy.  They were good, but different.  Then they are topped with melted fontina, eggs, sausage gravy and some hot sauce.  The only thing I would change is the cheese.  For some reason, the fontina just added an odd taste to an otherwise delicious meal.  I still ate about 3/4 of it, but would definitely request a different type of cheese next time.  My two dining companions each got a different type of omelet and they both enjoyed them.  With its close proximity to my house, I definitely think I will be dining here quite  a bit.",
