Once I managed to get through security, I headed to my gate to look at my options and they really were limited so I selected La Grande Orange since they had a pretty diverse selection and seemed somewhat reasonably priced.  My biggest complaint with La Grande Orange was the layout. There are several stations, one for pizza another for the bakery and another for sandwiches however there are four registers spaced out. I assumed that you could only order near the station you were ordering from, I was wrong so was everyone else and it caused a bit of confusion. The process is pretty simple once you get to a register, you place your order and will be called when your order is ready. I and ordered a pizza, which at $12 it was was reasonably priced considering many other options. I waited about 15+ minutes for my pizza which wasn't too bad since the terminal was pretty crowded.  Overall it was a decent option, but nothing to go crazy about.",

Kale is so chock-full of vitamins, but sometimes it's so darn tough. This kale was  tender and thinly shredded; topped w/ nutty quinoa, chopped red bell pepper, sunflower seeds, grapes, shredded Reggio cheese, and a tangy, lemony-garlicky dressing. Very generous portion, too.  I was at the farthest possible gate away (A-30), but had an hour between flights, so took a brisk walk through Terminals A, B, and C until I finally got to D. My FitBit clocked it at 1 mile each way, but totally worth it. Got 2 miles of Excercise AND an amazing salad. Can I create this salad at home? I'm going to try!  They have other great-sounding salads, sandwiches, burgers, pizzas, desserts, coffee, drinks, wine and beer, too. This will be a must-stop on any future trips through the Phoenix airport!",

It's kind of dry and chewy, with a strong alcohol flavor that's not matched well with whatever chocolate they use. They also top it with salt, and the brownie is not sweet enough to counter the salt flavor. So what you basically end up with is an offensive bitter square with a boozy salty flavor. It's not yummy and I would trash the recipe and start over.   If I could get my money back I would.",

Their dessert options are something to admire; they offer mini ding dongs and also mini cookies for those of us that are watching our weight, but still want to indulge a little.

Cocktails at happy hour are a smoking deal! $5 for a fabulous Greenpoint- generous pour, nice glass, single big cube. Our server had the kitchen split the yummy salad that B and I shared onto two plates (nice touch!). We also shared the \"Mother Earth\" pizza. Good amount of veggie toppings, but needed a little salt and spice for me. Our server was really amazing. She explained the HH deals multiple times, helped us get in one more round before it ended, and then split a very complicated itemized bill between 4 parties. She went above and beyond!

It was a hike for me coming from the US Airways A gates; all the way over to La Grande Orange which is at the very end of the concourse.(by South West airlines). But it was so worth it.My go to choices were \" the commuter breakfast sandwhich\" ,  the \"kale quinoa salad\" or the chickpea salad.  The commuter sandwhich has egg tomatoe onion and a little bit of mayo. You can add salmon or meat, your choice. It comes on their house made english muffins which are huge.(the way an enlish muffin should be) if your hungry this is the sandwhich for you; its filling and delicious. The 2 salads are both vegan and delcious. And surprisingly the salad portion is sufficient. If your not ravneously hungry one or two  of the salads will make you happy. They also have a whole bunch of bakery items and some are vegan and a few are whole grain and healthy. All the food is made at the moment you order it. You can see the chefs moving about in the kitchen doing their  best whipping up some yummy food. They also make delicious pizza, which is also freshly prepared right in front of you. La Grande Orange is a little pricey. But if your particular about what you eat. Like myself and you want to avoid crap fast food. Take the time while your at Skye Harbor and cheque out La Grande Orange. They have got a little bit of some thing for everybody. And its all scruptious and filling.",

Only reason for 1 star is because 1) we got our food, and 2) a man that seemed to be the manager/owner asked us if we needed help with anything while we waited for our food, showing that he's at least trying to act like he cares.  My wife and I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, a caesar salad, and 2 small mochas.  The salad was pre-made, fair enough. Later on when I did finally eat it, it didn't taste fresh, and I hope they added lemon or something to the dressing, because it tasted kind of funny. Hopefully my stomach won't be making me pay the price.  Our mochas came out next, and tasted cheap. And...did they use Hershey's chocolate syrup?! $3.50/ea for 12oz cups of cheap mocha, nice.  Grilled cheese with fries took way too long to make. We stood around for a good 20-30 minutes, and was starting to get concerned that we wouldn't have enough time to each before we have to board our flight.  The place is way overpriced. Over $20 for a small thing of lettuce, small grilled cheese with some  fries, and 2 small mochas.  Oh, and the girl that took our order was...having a bit of an attitude. Someone's tired from working hard all day, I assume. Thanks for showing it to your customers!  Overall, would NOT recommend this place at all to anybody.  Pros: -Got our food -Next to our gate  Cons: -Bad food -Bad service -Slow -Overpriced -Possibly expired food",

    "text": "Well, I tried to get my LGO fix before I left Phoenix. I made the mistake of thinking the airport version was the same as the flagship location in Arcadia. I have been to the flagship store over 100 times, and the food quality is always consistent & excellent. Their pizza is amazing yes, but so is their green chile burger. It's a generous beef patty made with never-frozen grass-fed beef. Now for the airport version of the green-chile burger that doesn't belong in the same universe: the beef patty was not the same weight, it was a thin, dry McDonald's quality patty. It lacked flavor and was just old & tired. Also I asked for it to be cooked medium & it was well-done. I don't think the English muffin was from LGO. There was no Russian dressing. The green chiles were soggy & disgusting to the point I took them off. I didn't have time to bring it back since I had to board a plane. If you are looking for a top-notch restaurant in Phoenix give LGO in Arcadia a try. Skip the airport location which is bringing down their brand that they have been trying to establish for many years.",

Not sure what I was expecting, but it sure wasn't this. The California burger was just passable.  The counter person emphasized how they cook their patties medium.  Mine was medium well PLUS.  No moisture left in the meat and it was nothing more than an $11 slider.  The sea salt brownie was inedible. The texture was supposed to be fudgy but came off as undercooked.  Tables are basically on the concourse so after settling diwn you have to pick up your things and try to balance it all with your plate of food.  A juggling act for the lone traveler.  The one bright spot was the hand cut well seasoned fries. Brought back memories of pre-franchise Chili's in the 70s or early 80s.  Two stars is probably generous.",

We ordered turkey sandwiches and a sea salt chocolate chip cookie.  The sandwiches were made on a soft high quality bread, a generous stack of sliced turkey breast, and fresh produce.  It was a large sandwich, which kept us full through our following flight.  After the sandwich we shared the cookie, and it was truly the best cookie I ever ate.  It was big and soft, yet it had slightly crispy edges, and was loaded with chocolate chips and sprinkled with sea salt. It had a lovely contrast of sweet and savory, and it was buttery and chocolaty.  This was the first time I had a cookie with sea salt, and I am totally hooked!  If I ever fly through Phoenix again, I will make sure to make at pit stop here!   Also next time I want to try pizzas, as they looked and smelled delicious!",

They have a modern menu with healthy choice options like Kale and Quinoa salads, Veggie Burgers, Chickpea Lettuce Wraps, along with all your more \"normal\" food items.

They have so much stuff to choose from here that everyone in your party should be able to find something to eat for breakfast or lunch. If you are in a hurry, you can pick up food to go quickly here, or you can sit down and eat after you order and pay as it's a fast casual spot.

I also ordered their tuna Nicoise salad which was ok. When it comes to tuna Nicoise I have a very particular idea in my head and this is more Americanized Nicoise salad. The tuna was way too sweet with raisins in it. Big chunks though which was great. Not a big fan but the salad was fresh and the hard boiled egg was perfectly cooked. The dressing was light and just had the right tanginess. Had the tuna been lemon based, it would be perfect.   I'm still a fan and will come by this place whenever I'm in the Terminal D.",

    "text": "I was in Phoenix for the day on business and landed around breakfast time, feeling a bit famished (the peanuts on my two-hour Sourhwest flight from Oakland were a bit inadequate). A quick glance at my Yelp app while standing in front of the first restaurant I came across - La Grande Orange - happily revealed that the very same establishment came highly recommended! \"What luck,\" I thought to myself.   I ordered a Zuni Burrito off the breakfast options helpfully put up on a board behind the counter, and waited about 10 minutes for my food, eagerly anticipating the tofu \"chorizo\" and charred tomato salsa (among other things like mushrooms, corn, potatoes, egg whites and spinach) my Zuni was meant to be filled with.   I opened up my burrito and the wrapper came apart. I have never had a burrito be served to me so badly wrapped. Never. Re-wrapping it up myself, I took my first bite, getting huge chunks of potato and bland tofu, but little else. This continued as I worked my way through this sorry excuse for a breakfast burrito, vainly searching for all the ingredients which were promised, letting out small grunts of satisfaction when I found a kernel of corn or a bit of spinach or mushroom. But it was mostly a mass of potato and tofu.   Filling, yes. Tasty, no. So if you decide to breakfast here, do yourself a favor and order something else. Not the Zuni Burrito.",

I waited at one register but the workers were too busy talking about their weekend plans to help me so I went and stood in line at the other register. When it came time for my turn the cashier walked off then a line formed at the first register where I initially waited. After a couple minutes I waved someone down and asked if I could pay here and he said he didn't realize I was ready. People standing at a register with their to-go salad looking inpatient generally mean they're ready. Anyway, I paid and left and the salad was tasty but the customer service is abysmal. Nothing like the Acadia location.",

    "text": "Lah Grand Orange?  Lah Gran-day Orange?  Lah Grann Or-hange?  I still don't know how to pronounce this place but whatever.  LGO it is.  The point is that I totally didn't expect to find pizza of this caliber at an airport.    Yelp said there was pizza here and that's all I needed to know to make the (loooong) walk from Concourse A to Concourse D.  I figured it would be one of those places where you point to a pre-made slice (sunning under a heat lamp for who knows how long) and wait for them to reheat it in the oven.    Instead there was a guy behind the counter flinging crusts with flour all over his apron.  They did have a display of pre-made pizzas but since they were out of cheese, they made our pizza fresh to order.  It took about ten minutes for it to come out.  It was a thin crust pie...nice and cheesy without being oily.  I got a stack of napkins to blot oil off the top but didn't even need to use them.  There were tiny chunks of tomato in the sauce and the sourdough crust had a satisfying crunch.  The pie was large enough for us to split but only because we were saving room for gelato.   The Mint Chunck (their spelling, not mine) was delicious too.  I was expecting a mint toothpaste flavor but instead it was earthy.  Bits of real mint were mixed in with broken slabs of chocolate (stracciatella style) and it was surprisingly good.  Again...not what I expected in an airport.    My only complaint about LGO was the lack of seating.  They had a cute cafe area out front but every seat was taken...too many of them by people who weren't even eating...reading newspapers, typing away on laptops, watching phone videos.  Fortunately, there were two open seats at one table and the people sitting there invited us to join them.    That aside, it was an enjoyable meal.  We'll be back to LGO on our way back through.  If we can find a place to sit next time, I will bump to five stars.",

Even though the other spot looks good, their to-go section didn't look as great.  So, after perusing La Grande Orange, then coming back to it...I walked away with a Pepperoni Pizza and a water. Of course it's overpriced, but it was pretty tasty. And by tasty I mean so oily it had to be good. For real though, it was tasty, but it literally comes with at least a liter of oil.  They had a bunch of drink options, salads, burgers, and a slew of other options. However, the pizzas are literally there for you to grab, pay, and go. Which is exactly the criteria that is needed when you only have 20 mins before your next flight.  It's decent, I was happy, but damn that box makes it hard to travel with. I'm pretty sure your fellow passengers will be envious of your food, so eat it coyly...as best you can with a pizza box to maneuver.  Grab more napkins than you'd think you'd need for ten pizzas, then grab a few more...",

A simple deli style, no server cafe that serves burgers, pizza, salads, sandwiches, breakfast and a variety of desserts. I got myself a California Burger (angus beef, havarti cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onions).  My first impression was that it is definitely smaller than the usual burgers served at other restaurants, but I guess that is to be expected in an airport.  With that being said, the burger was actually just the right size, very juicy and full of flavor. It also comes with  hearty side of fries. Airport priced, but well worth it.   The only thing I did not like about this place is that they do not offer fountain drinks...only bottled, and those cost $2.79 each . Enjoy!",

The food tastes exactly the same, the prices are the same, the service is the same and they are very fast!   I visited for breakfast and enjoyed the commuter sandwich but noticed that they have a wood-fired oven to make their well-known pizzas and they have a full menu of LGO favorites including all their breakfast, lunch and dinner offerings. They also have the cookies, baked goods and pre-made sandwiches.   LGO is located at gate D and it's worth visiting regardless of your location in Terminal Four!",

The space isn't large and what free space is left over is mostly taken up by displays; add in travelers with carry on luggage and it easily gets crowded.  Everyone seemed to congregate at the middle register. I avoided waiting in line by walking up to the clerk at the far left (empty) register to ask if it was open, which she was. Keep in mind there were 3 registers open, but the clerks at the 2 side registers weren't proactively assisting in clearing out the group of waiting customers nor were fellow customers aware that there were 2 other open registers *sigh*  Anyway after a weekend of non-stop weekend I wanted something healthy. I ordered the Zuni burrito: whole wheat tortilla with tofu chorizo; corn; spinach; potato; egg whites; and charred tomato salsa. YUM!  My favorite of all the ingredients was the charred tomato salsa. If they packaged and sold this in a bottle, I'd buy it!",

It was breakfast, but I wanted a sandwich. i got the stacked turkey sandwich that came with avocado and bacon, and it did not disappoint. the sandwich was stacked super high with quality ingredients, I was a happy camper. It was to be expected though, since I'm a super fan of LGO's pizza and other goods at their regular locations. Awesome!",

I grabbed dinner here before a flight last week and decided on the chickpea lettuce wraps.  My meal cost around $8 and came with two healthy and fresh wraps filled with a chickpea salad, sundried tomatoes, cucumbers and avocado slices.  Other menu options include creative salads (like the shredded kale and quinoa), fresh fruit and healthy sandwiches.    Service was both expeditious and friendly, which was a nice change from the typical surly attitude you get at airport establishments.  In my mind, this is \"as good as it gets\" at the airport - 5 stars!",

The fruit tarts are amazing- no jellies, just fruit and an amazing pastry crust!  And something I NEVER would have tried, but they sampled one day:  the gluten free walnut, chocolate chip cookie!  It is almost gooey in the center with a brownie-like taste.  It is just amazing! The pizzas are also fantastic and the veggie burger goes a long way when I have a few extra minutes to wait for them to make me something or I'm feeling like veggin' out.

Anyway, I got the commuter sandwich after all of the hubbub about how awesome it was from everyone....it was not good! The eggs appeared to be the same microwaved eggs you get at Einstein's and the sandwich had little to no flavor....The bacon was sad and flaccid. Luckily, I also got a red velvet cupcake again which allowed this  establishment to remain a 4 star place just for the sheer glory of that cupcake, but come on people! There needs to be some quality control or something, because that sandwich was just sad.",

In general, terminal 4 at Sky Harbor has developed some good restaurants, but this might be the best one once you get past security. I like that there's several options including salads, pizza, sandwiches, and even breakfast.   I had a chopped salad and really liked everything in it. It's always a little annoying to have to mix dressing (which the vinegarette here is really good!) in those plastic containers w/the salad contents, but what are you gonna do when you grab and go at the airport? I saw a woman behind the counter putting salads together so it looks like they put fresh ones out pretty often. I also snuck a piece of cheese pizza from my mom and it tasted good.   They have a couple beers on tap & a few wines to choose from. The food here seems pretty comparable in price to the regular restaurant, but alcohol is a little more (as the airport does).   I also tried the cookie with \"everything\" in it (forget what it's called) and it was yummy!",

I love all of the cute things to look at in the market and they have a great selection of sodas, tea, wine and beer. The gelato is amazing!!! My favorite flavors are coconut and pistachio. Now for the pizzeria, all of the pizza is good! The sourdough crust is what make the pizza in my opinion. My favorites are the rocket man (spicy) and I add chicken sausage, the fallen angel no fennel add broccoli or just classic pepperoni add Fresno chili (spicy) and an egg! The pimento cheese dip is phenomenal and I could eat wayyy too much of it. Salads: pizzeria chopped or smoked salmon, both delicious! And try the wings! Extra crispy extra sauce on the side with house made ranch!",

I would actually opt to come here as a restaurant for that - and having it delivered as a pick-up option during a layover it is an EASY 5 stars.  I hate airport food. I loved this.

The toast was also wonderful, and came with seedless blackberry jam and two pats of butter. I would have liked more fruit, but the slice of cantaloupe I did have was great.   I would have paid more for this, but I'm glad I didn't have to. They told me it would take ten minutes to prep, which would have been totally fine, but it was more like five. Plenty of seating and a well-stocked extras bar nearby helped me get my coffee ready. This is exactly what you need when you come to the airport, it was the perfect fuel for my travel day!",

I fly out of here pretty regularly, and I'm always amazed at the variety of legitimately good local restaurant options here, as opposed to other airports where you're limited to fast food chains.   I'm a huge fan of LGO. Their sourdough English muffins are what dreams are made of; I highly recommend getting your burger on one of those bad boys. Life changing.  I had a 5:55 am flight out of PHX this morning, and luckily for me this location opens at 5 am sharp. I had the commuter sandwich with turkey and avocado ($9.55 + 0.50 to add avocado) and it definitely hit the spot. I ordered at the counter and it was out in less than 5 minutes. For those of you who love spice, they have a condiment bar with Sriracha and Tapatio and a variety of other hot sauces. The large cold brew ($5) is about 20 ounces of smoooooth strong (in a good way!) deliciousness. They have a ton of \"patio\" tables as well as a couple big communal tables with power sockets if you plan to hang out for a while. If you get a regular coffee - free refills. I didn't have any of their pastries today, but their cupcakes are amazing too :)",

The salad comes with kalamata olives, par-boiled green beans, tomatoes, half a (perfectly cooked) hard-boiled egg and a side of green leaf lettuce.  This salad along with a glass of red wine ordered on the flight and I was in heaven!  Great for taking on the plane too - its so fresh, no one will know you are eating tuna and its not at all messy.

I had the Stacked Turkey Sandwich and I was shocked it was very good and it came with a lot of meat. Included with the sandwich were pickles and fruit. The prices are very reasonable, especially for an airport location. One gripe I have with the place is the order pickup. I can't entirely blame the workers because there are just so many people, both patient and impatient, ordering food. The workers are completely lost on orders and can't keep up calling the order numbers. If you can look past the questionable pickup, I definitely recommend this place if you have time and need food at the PHX airport (located at Terminal 4).",

If there was a way to order online while I was in line for security that would make it even better.",

Last note, the larger tables have outlets in one or two of the corners so you can charge up while you eat.",

I love that there is so much variety, so many healthy options, and so many vegetarian options! The pizza sounded pretty great, I'll have to try it sometime, but I wasn't super hungry so I went for a salad. I got the Kale Quinoa Salad without cheese, and it was very good. Sometimes kale has an odd taste, or the taste is just overpowering, but I really enjoyed it in this salad. It also came with a lemon vinegarette which was also good. My sister and mom split a burger and chicken ceasar salad, and they both really enjoyed their food as well. Their only complaint was that they did not like one of the dressings, luckily they had it on the side. For dessert we tried an array of cookies! The chocolate chip sea salt was good, but there was too much salt on them. The butterscotch oat cookies were probably my favorite, I love butterscotch. We also tried the A to Z cookie, which was okay, and the peanut butter cookie, which was much better than we had expected it to be! Next time I'm hungry and in terminal D, I will be making a return. Also hope to check out the original La Grande Orange location in the near future!",

I flew Southwest back from New Orleans and to my pleasant surprise, LGO was located right next to the gate that I exited from.  I was so excited to see it, and so impressed with the appearance, that I ended up grabbing a bite and sitting down to eat and do some work rather than rushing home like I usually do!  They did a great job duplicating LGO in it's airport location.  The menu surprisingly offers *almost* everything that the original location at 40th Street and Campbell offers.  (I believe they are just missing the sushi.)  The airport has an LGO Bakeshop... don't miss the butterscotch oatmeal and chocolate chip with sea salt cookies!  And they have a Grateful Spoon gelato area too...  friendly service to boot!  After eating my way through Nola, I passed on dessert this time around, but I went for the Thai Chicken Salad and it tasted just as great as it usually does; I guess they didn't compromise on quality at all!  Now that I know this location exists, I may have to head to the airport a little earlier from now on... cheers to great local options at PHX for travelers!",

Was very pleased with the size of it for the price, especially since it came with a little fruit salad! Cost me right around $8.   While waiting, I eyed other people's pizzas, burgers and fries, and baked goodies. All quality items!! Of note were their huge cookies, like the sea salt chocolate chip cookie.

I also decided to try the Spicy Chickpea Lettuce Wrap which had two pretty big sized lettuce wraps topped with mashed garbanzo beans made with olive oil, red onions, celery, red bell pepper, cayenne pepper and paprika. It was all topped with fresh avocado and sundries tomatoes. It was only $7.50.   I also loved that this place had lots of sit down seating. You just get in line to order, then they call your name. There were several lines with different options. There was a pizza station (with vegan and gluten free pizza!), a sandwich/ salad line, breakfast food/burgers and this place even had a coffee bar with specialty drinks and baked goods (I didn't see vegan/ gluten free baked goods). I will definitely try to get more layovers at this airport so that I can eat here again. :)",

But after paying way too much for a bagel, banana, and water at the San Francisco airport, the prices at La Grande Orange were refreshingly reasonable for airport food. And what's more: the tuna melt was REALLY good. The bread was hearty, fresh, and quite tasty. The tune was doctored up with some pleasant additives like yellow raisins which enhanced without overwhelming. The tuna was not the sopping-with-mayonnaise tuna-melt-tuna that you sometimes get (paid more for a lesser, overly-salty version in Carmel, CA, several days before). I mean, it was a really good sandwich (deserves two mentions). No idea what the rest of the food is like, but yikes: this is worth checking out.    No issues with service, as someone's complained about. Maybe just a good day, but credit where due.",

BUt, I am making an exception for the BREAKFAST BURRITO here. This thing is PACKED with bacon and the salsa is extraordinarily good. We only bought one because they are $10 bucks (airport pricing) and not particularly large. BUT, as I sit here writing this review, I am pretty kisses I didn't one of my own and shared with my husband. He is eyeing the mine now and thinking of getting another! So, if you are on an early morning flight out of Phoenix, treat yourself to this for breakfast. Get 2 salsa cups! OMG MY HUBBY JUST GOT UP WHILST I WAS DOING THIS REVIEW AND GOT BACK IN LINE TO FET ANOTHER ONE! Wow!",

It's not often you find decent airport food but La Grande Orange definitely altered my mindset on that. For those not as into sandwiches as I am, there are also pizzas, burgers, salads, omelettes, gelato soups, etc.   My girlfriend and I got the Stacked Turkey Sandwich both times and they were equally as amazing. I'm also a lover of all sandwiches, but this was unlike any airport food I've ever had. The contents were super fresh and they didn't skim on anything. It's a really great spot to grab a quick meal and the prices aren't terrible as well. They do stop making fresh sandwiches quite early, but the cooked foods are available until closing. Highly recommend if you have a stop in Phoenix!",

Thankfully, it helped to have a positive experience during my layover in PHX. My flight from IND to PHX was delayed so I thought it was going to miss the connecting flight. Good thing that was delayed too.  This gave me time to grab a quick bite to eat. It was late at night, but La Grande Orange was still open. Hallelujah! Probably wouldn't have eaten dinner otherwise. And the cashiers were so nice, which means a lot to a disgruntled traveler waiting for a delayed flight.  I got the chopped turkey salad, which was a good size and super cheesy. Yum! I took this to eat at a gate adjacent to mine since the shop was obviously closing down. I couldn't finish the whole salad but ate as much as my tired self could stomach. It was satisfying and saved me from hunger going home. If I had a layover in PHX again, I would totally come here, and it looks like many fellow Yelpers feel the same way!",

A lot of times when you take the cheese off a salad, it also results in taking off the flavor, but not in this case! The salad was very tasty and I wolfed it down. The Vegan Dalai Lama Pizza has cashew cheese on it, and it was very tasty. I added onions and garlic to it for free. I believe they have one or two options for vegan dessert, but I was so stuffed that I didn't inquire. Will definitely return!",

It was packed as usual and La Grande Orange has the same great english muffins and homemade jams as the location on 40th and Campbell.      Nice friendly staff and a great selection.    It was the busiest place in the airport and worth the limited wait.",

As it turns out, they have an impressive selection of fresh, green, and healthy creations ready for takeout for the hurried business traveler.  And for those in less of a hurry you've got sandwiches, burgers, pizza, and more cooked to order. I had the spicy chick pea lettuce wraps - I'm not a vegetarian by any means, but to my great surprise this dish not only tasted good, but actually filled me up too.    The layout of the joint was a bit confusing and the general flow of foot traffic needs improvement. I'll swing by for another bite next time I'm in this wing of the airport, especially considering the only other food option here is the less-than-average Mexican restaurant next door.",

Thanks to Yelpers, I chose this place over several other seemingly attractive options and found a very unlikely food option in an airport. The place was a bakery, pizza spot and sandwich spot all rolled into one. At times, this can be bothersome, as specialization is key, but again, it's in an airport.   My wife and I were in sandwich mode and looking for something hot and we both found good options. I chose the Cubano hot pressed panini and my wife the hot pressed tuna sandwich. The prices were more reasonable than I'm used to from airports at about $7.50, so this provided some comfort.   When the food came, my cubano looked delicious and the taste did not disappoint. I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though I'd say a ham and cheese sandwich with pickles would be a more accurate description. My wife too liked her sandwich.   We had some cookies too and found them good, albeit sweet as all hell.   I'd seek this place out again if stuck in Phoenix in the future.",

Also some ready made sandwiches. You can order a more sit down meal as well. They have breakfast, lunch, and dinner. - price - amazed that I wasn't ripped off. I got a huge salad full of quality products, its not junk for your money. -fast: you can run in there like a mad storm, grab food and hop on your plane.

Things on the menu: eggs, oatmeal, other breakfast, burgers, pizza, salads, and a few other random things. The menu is reasonably priced. My breakfast cost $8 without a drink. I've been to the LGO locations within Phoenix.  PROS: - scrambled eggs tasted good, and had herbs - organic fruit was fresh and good - healthy options - fast service - salads can be taken to go - english muffins are sold individually, by the half dozen, and by the dozen  CONS: - bacon was very greasy and could have been much more crispy - include strawberry jam. Blackberry preserves doesn't taste very good. - signature english muffin was a little bit floppy due to the moisture in the plastic container. Maybe put the english muffin in a different holder? Small paper bag? - calling out names loudly is really annoying to listen to after 1 name. Maybe use a number system? Or provide a bigger waiting area?  Bottom line: I would come back, but I would probably order something else like the pancakes or a different egg meal. Or I would eat lunch/dinner here and try something else.",

There were a lot of options but it was mainly different combinations of the same thing. I ended up ordered a BLT, which took forever to make. and a breakfast burrito, which was the quickest. If Peets was closer to us (we were dead tired from Spring Training) then I would have just gone there and spent less money for better coffee and breakfast.

    "text": "Expensive and slow..  the first time I ordered a gluten free Margherita pizza with pepperoni and it was just alright.  Second time at this airport I ordered the green Chile burger.  I asked for it cooked medium.  I was in a rush to get to my plane so I grabbed it and ran once they called my name.  Got to the airplane and went to eat my burger and the patty was so raw the middle was falling apart and my bun was soaked in blood... blood and oil was also pooling in the bottom of my box and soaking into the fries.  Wish I took a picture.  I was starving so I ate the fries that weren't touching it... I won't say don't eat here because you have limited options but have time to sit and eat or at least check your food before running off.  They also have items that don't require cooking which may be a better option and what I should have done.",

I mean they were good but really, I could feel my entire army of kids with 1/3 of what we paid for both of these meals.  To make matters worse, I didn't know where the heck to pick up the pizza we ordered.  There weren't any signs or anything.  We stayed on the left side near the fridge because we ordered on that side.  We received our drinks and our burger on that side but when I asked about our pizza, the workers were looking at me oddly and then treated me horribly like I was supposed to know to pick up the pizza on the other side.  Really people.  I want to give this place even less stars but the food was actually good.  Boo to getting food at the airport and rude people.",

I liked the mix of vegetables and I didn't feel heavy or greasy after eating it. The burgers people were ordering looked delish. My friend got a breakfast sandwich which he thought was pretty good but that the bun was a bit stale. Even though LGO is famous for their buns, we were thinking maybe the airport location doesn't always get to enjoy the super fresh quality that the Arcadia location gets to. Either way, it was still good.  Next time I am at the Phoenix airport I will definitely stop by.",

I ordered an english muffin, a honey latte & some sea salt chocolate chip cookies to take to my family back home.  My order came out quickly & the english muffin was huge, very fluffy.  The star of the show was the honey latte...mmm. No bitter, burnt taste, just smooth yummy coffee! My family & I loved the chocolate chip cookies! I'm a sucker for anything salted! I will be visiting their other location to try out more of their food. Can't wait!",

Would be nice to have both menus up on both sides, or at least centered so you can see it from either line. Putting in your order was fast, but waiting for any non pre-packaged meals took a bit of time. Staff was courteous and it's nice they ask for your name so it's easier to tell when your order is ready. Good amount of seating, but it's open and located near a bunch of a gates, so it'll be hard to nab a seat.",

I'm giving an extra star for a really nice guy who handed me my salad, but the food was really, really one star worthy.  This place has been my go-to on my many Phoenix connections for a healthy, quick meal to go.  In the past, this place has been solid.  The last time I'd been, I've had a sandwich that has been borderline \"airport food\" vibe--soggy bread, processed lunch meat, etc-- but it was pre-made, so I get it.  That was on me.  This I opted for the Thai chicken salad that was made-to-order.  It was not good, y'all.  Chicken was completely unseasoned--like, no taste.  Lettuce was 100% chopped iceberg.  Dressing was oil.  Not like \"vinegar and oil based dressing\"--like I shook it up, dipped my first bite in it, and I got a mouthful of lettuce and oil.  I had five bites and legit feel my stomach churning.  I had to stop.  If I hadn't grabbed this to go and run to my flight, I'd have legit taken it back to ask if it was a mistake, but I just scrolled through recent Yelp to see pics, and it looks like it was not a mistake.  And I'm not fancy--I eat at Taco Bell as often as I eat real food.  Anyway, if you're reading this, dear manager, please try the Thai Chicken Salad.  It's not good.  It's not like \"some people won't like this\"--I have a lot of room for varying tastes.  This just isn't good.  But the guy who handed it to me was super nice.  So thank you to him.",

We didn't have a chance to visit the actual restaurant of either when we were in Phoenix so when we were at the airport & saw this place we were so excited!   It was so delicious!!!! We got the fallen angel and the sonoma salad and they were both amazing. Definitely not cheap but to get gourmet food at the airport was totally worth it versus same price at some other place!  Crust, toppings and cheese were amazing! The salad was fresh and had a great mix of ingredients!  We will be back for sure to this or the main location!",

I have eaten meals here twice and stopped here several times for coffee and a treat.  Each time has been quite good.  For food, I've tried a burger and also a hot sandwich, and each were good.    I enjoy the cold-brewed iced coffee very much, so that's my recommendation if you're not traveling at mealtime.  Get yourself an iced coffee with two $.75 mini-cookies, pour in some half-and-half and you have an excellent snack before hopping on your plane.    If you arrive in terminal D, grab an iced coffee to go and drag it out of the terminal on to your rental car bus.  It is a great pick-me-up to nurse for the whole day.",

The kale and quinoa salad is a must-order for anybody craving vegetables and looking for something to take on a long flight toward the east coast.  The kale and other sturdy vegetables stand up well to sitting in a plastic clamshell without getting soggy.  The quinoa adds an incredibly pleasant nuttiness and crunch.  The dressing is tangy and rounds out the dish.  Over a week later, I am still thinking about how to replicate this salad, and I can't think of the last time I've felt that way about airport food.  (I didn't care for the grapes and thought the salad would have been better without them-- but I'm not docking this review to four stars, because IT WAS AN AIRPORT.)",

Hot great egg potatoes bacon ratio and salsa had good flavor. I'm picky about my OJ and let me tell you this OJ was soooo good. Also had a little sweet tooth so ordered the coffee cake which is one of my favorites. It was a little dry but flavorful.

Not that green ooze restaurants sometimes try to pass off as guacamole.  We sat at the bar and had the best service I've ever had in an airport restaurant. Olivia and her partner were fantastic!

Never heard of the big orange  but this spot was crowded while the adjacent restaurant was nearly empty.   The space is semi-circular with four \"stations\" along the inside perimeter and seating on the outside. No table service, strictly order and find a seat. The stations included a Beverage section for alcohol, wine and beer a Burger station for grilled sandwiches and burgers, a Sandwich station for cold wraps and other sandwich fare and a Pizza station for personal sized build your own pizzas. Basically all the food groups and something to wash it all down!  We opted for a moderately healthy choice, turkey on Levain (sourdough) bread. We found that all the cold sandwiches were premade that day, AND , we both wanted something slightly different than the menu (no tomato on one, no avocado on the other). As we suggested to the cashier we would deconstruct the sandwich, she offered to have new ones made to order! Boom! Instant fans.  Sandwiches were both good and fresh and reasonably priced for airport fare. Definitely would recommend if you need feeding in the terminal",

It took about 10 minutes +/-  The pizza was pretty greasy (so if you get one, take lots of napkins). The pizza sauce actually had some chunks of tomatoes which was nice. The sausage & pepperoni were good, although there wasn't much for the price, over $16 for a small 10 inch pizza. The crust was also good, but a tad chewy.   It was filling (although I wasn't very hungry) and I might order one again. It was just good, not great. But the people working there were very friendly!",

I was sitting next to a lady that was eating a delicious looking pepperoni pizza from this place and couldn't help walk down to try this place. There is NO up charge for gluten free crust, which is not common but much appreciated. I ordered the Margarita on gluten free crust, it was a 15 minute wait while they baked it in their wood fired oven. The pizza was about $15 which is decent for gluten free pizza. I was quite thrilled by the price and flavor.",

They have a variety of dishes to suit most diets, including spicy chickpea lettuce wraps for gluten-free vegans or anyone looking for a healthier option. They also have made-to-order pizzas and breakfast dishes, pre-packaged salads and sandwiches, and various baked goods including super-sized cookies. There are several open coolers with bottled water, sodas, Red Bull, and other beverages. The front of the restaurant has a decent sized seating area with tables that are on a first-come, first-served basis.  Although the spicy chickpea lettuce wraps are tasty, they could greatly benefit from a touch less heat and some salt. They're somehow on the cusp of being offensively hot, yet surprisingly bland. I'd also ditch the sun-dried tomatoes. They're slimy and unnecessary with the cucumbers, avocado, and pickles already served on/with the wraps. That of course is my personal preference, but since these are a pre-made dish, it would be nice to see those eliminated.",

Famished I saw a sign in the Phoenix airport that said the Phoenix Airport was the tastiest & friendliest airport in America. I was to put that to the test stopping at La Grande Orange for a Zuni Burrito.  The Zuni Burrito is a whole wheat tortilla w/ tofu \"chorizo\", mushrooms, spinach, potato, & comes w/ a charred tomato salsa.  Normally it comes w/ egg whites yet my friendly server knowing I was vegan suggested customizing it by replacing the egg whites w/ avocado.  I appreciated the recommendation as the burrito hit the spot. One of the better airport burritos I have had in some time.",

When we arrived at gate C19, we quickly checked the monitors for our departure gate for our connecting flight leaving in a couple of hours. The monitors indicate gate B6 so off to B6 we went where we came upon Le Grande Orange. After reading favorable Yelp reviews and seeing they have a wood-fired oven for making pizzas, we opted to order a pizza to share.  We ordered their Gladiator pizza ($16.50) which came with huge slices of pepperoni and sausage. All pizzas were personal-size but we weren't all that hungry so we shared one. The pizza was good, with a nice chewy crust with just the right char.  All in all, a very good pizza at the airport, albeit a bit pricy. Was going to give it 3 stars, but after considering its airport location, decided to give them 4 stars instead. Quick lunch for 2 came out to just under $21.  Oh yeah, good thing we re-checked the monitors again as our departure gate was changed, moving us back to gate C19.",

Chickpea Lettuce Wraps - ask for a side of their homemade ranch to go with this, it's the perfect complement and really makes the dish delicious  The Mother Earth Pizza - if you like vegetables as much as I do, you will LOVE this! Broccolini, artichokes, olives, bell peppers and more are in this wood fired pizza. I always balk at the price ($16.5 for a personal? Really?) but it is absolutely delicious and great to share with a friend if you both want to try multiple things.

Real fruit to accompany it?   Yes please.  Is it the best breakfast EVER? No. But it doesn't need to be. It's airport food. And quite good at that. Definitely worth seeking out when you're waiting for your flight. Well worth it.",

I had the egg white omelet with turkey, and then fresh salsa with cherry tomatoes and avocado on the side. The salsa was great, the omelet was greasy and needed salt. However, when do you get an airport restaurant that offers eggs and breakfast food all day? I was just happy to see something besides burgers, bars and pre-made sandwiches. So I can't complain. Plus they had a great selection of healthy desserts on display. (Depends on what your definition of healthy is I guess- gluten free, things like that)",

Had the Red Velvet Cupcake, Oatmeal Butterscotch Cookie, and Giandujia Croissant this time around and as usual everything was high quality while service is every bit up to snuff with the original location.  The best part?  No price hike for the airport location.",

Rest assured, the friendly staff pointed me to the very well stocked cold case and I was able to get a tasty side of mixed fruit with creme fraiche for $3. There were fresh strawberries, grapes and something else, I forgot already, oops. There were definitely other choices in that cold case that I will be back for next time. The line was quick, smiles all around, and for once I got to eat something I didn't regret before flying! I have a feeling next visit will give me enough of an experience to merit the 5th star.

    "text": "At Phoenix (yes, right now) for a brief 1.5 hour layover between Chicago and Burbank (CA). Famished, I got off the plane in search for some good grub. I'm not a fan of \"local\" airport food because generally the food is overpriced and subpar in taste and quality. Thus, I searched for  McDs (or Burger King...something familiar). Didn't find any around gate D.   At first I was attracted to the smell of the wood oven pizzas. I asked the cashier lady - \"How big is the pizza?\"   \"10 to 11 inches - it comes in 8 slices.\" There was no way that I was going to be able to finish that all by myself. Searched around the long list of menu behind each cashier (4 of them in total), standing behind the long counter. Get this - they were serving Eggs (breakfast style) during lunch.   Anyhow, long long story short, there were several 2 things that impressed me about this joint:  1) Food - I sampled the A-Z cookie and ordered the Tuna Salad. The Tuna Salad was one of the best I've ever tried ...EVER. It had thin thin slices of granny smith apple and the tuna wasn't overly dosed in mayo. It was really good. I paid $7.95.   2) Service - I'm not exaggerating or kidding when I say this - the service here is up there...better than Starbucks during its heydays.  While waiting for my food, I was asked (very politely) by 5 different employees, \"Have you been helped?\"   As soon as I finished my meal, a server-girl came up to my side and asked if she can take my plate away.   Let me make it clear - this place looks and feels like low-key, but serves and acts like 5-star hotel.   Anyhow, if you every fly through Phoenix (Gate D area), definitely try La Grande.",

Good food, moderate prices, and very friendly customer service. We got a chance to visit with Chauncy, who interrupted his lunch break to make sure our order was progressing properly. He's VERY proud of his place and justifiably so.   Green chili burger is PERFECT!  Just the right amount of heat and seasoning. Hot, crispy fries, all cooked to order.  All in all, excellent experience.",

I found it at Gate D and was pleased at all of the stations and options they have - I'm pretty sure they offer their full menu, or pretty darn most of it. I had a glass of wine and the Gladiator pizza, and I grabbed a cookie for the flight. It took about 10 minutes for the pizza to be ready and I had to wait for it to cool down since it was piping. I really enjoyed it and their sourdough crust is a unique touch. My experience makes me definitely want to make it out to their restaurant.",

Then I saw the \"Zuni burrito\" which pretty much looked like a healthy breakfast burrito.  WOW! This was the best healthy breakfast burrito I ever had in my life!

The biggest con is the extremely limited seating.

The turkey stack sandwich was very filling with mounds of turkey breast, avocado, tomatoes, on a multigrain bread. The open-faced chicken salad sandwich easily had over a cup of filling in it and served on grilled multigrain bread.  The cost of the sandwiches I thought was very reasonable for the quantity, quality, and being served at an airport.   The grab and go case offers a quick convenience for travelers on their way to their next destination.",

The sandwich was so large we could have shared. Their homemade English muffins are to die for and I could have just eaten that.   My husband ordered a Caesar salad. The salad was meh. There were tons of to-go salads in the display case and my husband figured that's what they were - to-go salads. Since we were sitting down and eating he thought they would make the salad fresh and bring it out on a plate. Nope. The employee grabbed a box and handed it to my husband. There wasn't a lot of salad in the large box and the crotons were soggy from being inside the box.   Overall, the freshly made items were delicious and the bakery case was full of tempting treats. If I come back through the airport, I'll definitely be grabbing a latte and sweet treat.",

I ordered this Thai Princess Chicken Salad (not sure if that is the correct name, but remembered that it does have the word Princess in it) that had mixed greens, red onions, cilantro (my fav ingredient in the world) spicy peanut dressing/sauce, tender diced/sliced chicken breast, diced red peppers.

There were plenty of other restaurants but I was sure this was the one.   We tried the California Burger, the breakfast burrito called the Zuni Burrito and lastly, the chocolate chip cookie with sea salt.   The California burger was perfect. The fries it came with were nice too. The burrito however was just average. It was a bit flavorless actually. I thought the hot sauce they provided with it would add more flavor, but sadly that was not the case. And the chocolate chip cookie was massive and amazing. I wish I could have one right now!",

The pizza also looked quite tasty, but takes more time because you have to wait for it to bake.

They stress quality in their food, using more natural ingredients and providing healthier options.  They make their pizzas from scratch which are made to order in their wood fired oven, unless you want to pick one up already made and heated.  They also have an array of pre-made salads and sandwiches, as well as a menu where you can order something freshly made.  Lots of variety.  Vegetarian and vegan friendly too.  Breakfast served until 5:00PM.  Service is fast.  There is a seating area out front but hard to find a table.  Yes, it is quite pricey, but what can you expect from being trapped in an airport.  At least spend it on good quality food.",

The servers were all extremely friendly and were accommodating as I ordered a lettuce-wrapped green chile burger and subbed green beans as my side. The burger itself was average and the chiles didn't pack much flavor other than intense heat. I didn't hate it but it wasn't anything to call home about. The green beans were tossed in garlic olive oil and were outstanding - win for Team Orange!  Needless to say, I ordered a drink to accompany my entree and went with the a tasty $7.25 house IPA the server recommended. When I initially asked the server what drinks they had she told me about their beer selection. I only found out *after* paying for my IPA that they had $5 glasses of wine. When I politely (I promise, I was nice) brought it up with her she said, \"oh, I just don't like wine myself so I don't really think to tell people about it.\" I didn't think a drink selection could be so complicated. I know that this is a small gripe, but it's annoying for a penny-pincher like me.  Overall, I'd be willing to give La Grande Orange one more go if I'm back in the PHX terminal.",

Usually, you have these chains and generic restaurants in there but not at Sky Harbor. There's an LGO.  There's already an LGO \"intersection\" in Phoenix with the pizzeria, bakery, burger place and grocery. The food is great there. I compared the prices at the airport with the regular prices and they were the same! You would figured that you would get charged an arm and a leg because it's inside an airport. But no... great food, same price.  I love the English muffins, the Kale salad and pizza. The sea salt chocolate chip cookie is good too. So if you are in Terminal 4 flying Southwest, you can head toward Gates C-D and grab some good food. It's worth the walk... or a ride on the moving walkway. You'll get there in like 2 minutes!  The food is really good, the price is fair, the staff is great, and you have a HUGE variety of items to choose from on the menu. Sandwiches, pastries, pizza, salad, soup, etc. Go try it out next time, and then go to the regular LGO location too. You'll love that you did. :)",

The concept is fast casual, you place your order with the cashier and sit and wait for your order to be called. It's mix between pre made items organized in a fridge, pizza bar, burger, sandwich bar. I love that they had healthy choices, they had a variety of pre made salads, I got the chicken Caesar and fresh squeeze orange juice for a little over $10. That's not bad for airport in my opinion. It was very fresh, my chicken looked like it was shredded off a rotisserie. Tasted very good and it was a large portion, almost 50% of the salad. The decor here is also sleek and modern. I would recommend this place, great options if you have time to kill or on the go.",

First of all, the organization was awful. 2 registers but so many people just standing around waiting for their food that I couldn't tell if they were in line or just waiting. The prepared salads seemed WAY overpriced for the amount of salad you actually got. Also, when asking what type of bakery was in the case, the cashier had to guess for some items which really turned me off from buying a mystery pastry.   I finally ended up with a egg sandwich on an English muffin with avocado. It was tasty, but at 8 bucks, my pockets were not pleased with my choice.  This stop was better than eating at a fast food place, but it was a clustered mess and the prices were way too high for my liking.",

When I'm looking for something lighter, I'll go for one of their salads which offer the added benefit of not creating a cloud of odor should you take the leftovers on the plane with you. If the salad is not your thing, try one of their burgers. And make sure you have it served on one of LGO's fresh baked English muffins. The one an only time that I had an issue with the food that had been served, the manager himself brought me the rectified order, apologized for the mistake, and offered me a bakery item. In short, even though this particular LGO is managed by HMS, you can expect the same food that you would expect from La Grand Orange in Pasadena and almost the same level of service.",

    "text": "Can you ever had a 5 star experience in an airport?  I'm not sure, but the food here comes darn close.  We tried a roast beef sandwich and the chickpea / roasted tomato / lettuce wrap. Both items were very flavorful.  There was a several minute wait for the roast beef sandwich, but it was worthwhile.  The chickpea lettuce wrap had really good flavor, and it was wonderful to eat something that was 1) healthy and 2) vegetarian while in an airport.  It would have been impossible to eat as a wrap without making a giant mess, but I used a fork and knife and it worked out great.  As for the ordering & dining experience... There were several registers scattered around the various counters and they were all staffed, but the throngs of people everywhere made getting to the registers a bit difficult.  I would recommend some crowd control stanchions in front of each register to organize things a bit more (think of the line guides you see at Noodles & Co) and perhaps have some printed out menus as people wait in line.   A sign that says \"Any item may be ordered at any register\" would be good too - some people were insisting on waiting by the register that was near a \"pizza\" sign simply because they thought they had to be in that line to order that item, when that wasn't True.   My other comment was that it was hard to find seating - many of the small tables had been combined to form large tables - which in an airport, isn't necessarily a bad thing - given the carry-ons, purses, coats, etc that most people are schlepping around.  We just asked a twosome sitting at a table for 8 if they minded some company.  They didn't, so it wasn't a problem at all.  A couple of other points: -the food was very reasonably priced (given that you're in an airport!) -you can get non-breakfast items in the morning.  I don't know about you, but I don't always want eggs at 10 am...especially if I've been up for 6 hours at that point; that's when I'm looking for lunch.  Le Grande Orange had a great selection of breakfast and lunch items, and all were available to be ordered at 10 am.  The food was 5 star.  The ordering experience (the day that I was there) was a 3 star experience, so it averages to 4 stars.  However, the ordering issues are small logistics problems that can be fixed easily, so I'm not worried about it and I would deal with the hassles again in order the tasty food.  At the end of the day, I will absolutely come to a Le Grande Orange when I'm looking for a good healthy lunch.",

If you want a water, a bag of English muffins, or maybe a cup of fruit then it's fine.  I just ordered eggs, sausage, fruit, and an English muffin.  They weren't scrambled but just one flat thin overcooked egg.  The sausage was disgusting.  So overcooked and hard it clearly came from early early this morning and sat or from yesterday and was warmed.  The fruit cup, different than the prepackaged fruit they sell separately, was dark brown around all the edges.  Look at my other reviews and you'll find that I am always consistent with reviews and give places a second chance.  I've been to their main Phoenix location and the market was great. The food we had their was mildly disappointing to average.  I will not spend another dollar here.  When you leave a review try to forget your perception of the place and how awesome their reputation alone is.  Judge it on the experience.  This place sucks and after multiple times I've solidified that fact.   Colleagues have told me the same but they don't yelp.  Many of these popular local restaurants that have airport locations use airport employees because it's cheaper.  The exception that I'm aware of is Cartel Coffee.  They employ their own employees that have been properly trained and care about the end product.  This place just isn't worth the great tasty muffins.",

While waiting, they started boarding my flight (air carrier was mixed up and referenced wrong flight), so when I asked how quick it would be ready, Ski (?) told me just to board and they'd deliver my food. Found this hard to believe as they were very busy, but I trusted him. Before the plane closed the door, the flight attendant came to me with a bag from La Grande Orange withy meal - a veggie panini sandwich that was delicious! I think they need to start promoting that service of meal delivery on the runway. It was an awesome experience and so impressed with Ski's degree of customer service.",
