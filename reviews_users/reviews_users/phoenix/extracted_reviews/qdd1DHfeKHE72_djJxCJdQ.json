We paid $18 for two margaritas that were served in a small glass, I don't think I will ever go back there again the only reason I went I saw the commercials on TV I figured I'd give it a shot not very impressive.",

My wife and I even had our wedding luncheon here. it's usually pretty good. But tonight was horrendous. our server didn't greet us for probably 10 min. and after we ordered our food my drink needed refilled and I asked for a water for my son who is one. he came back and refilled our chips but forgot my son's refill and my son's water. another 10 minutes go by and still no drinks. I finally get  refill but no water so I ask again he said he would bring it right out. he didn't. our food came and then he finally got my son his water. My wife's burrito was cold and soggy. I told the waiter I would not be paying for her meal since it was so horrible. he tried to blame it on her saying that the dish she ordered gets soggy fast. that's a lie. then he ran out credit card twice and over charged us. after speaking with the manager we explained the situation  he then started getting rude with my wife. needless to say I didn't get my money back and I will never step foot in this restaurant again. the staff was so rude. Worst experience in my 10 years of dining here.",

Not only did we receive top-notch service (Many thanks to our amazing waiter, Ken), but our food was so good and served in a matter of minutes from when we ordered it. And you thought only Jimmy John's served your food to you lightning fast?!   Ken made sure our glasses were filled, checked in on us to see how we liked our meals, and was very efficient. He also pronounced my dad's last name correctly when giving him back his credit card after dad paid the bill. That deserves kudos in my eyes right there as my family last name is hard to pronounce and hard to spell for many people, despite it only being 6 letters.   I had the Baja Chimi and it was so good and filling! I will definitely order that again!   Great service + great food + great company=An outstanding experience!",

    "text": "I seriously believe that we ordered the wrong things. Let's start with the good things about our experience here. Restaurant looks clean, we requested to sit out at the patio since the weather was nice. Scott our server greeted us, put down the complimentary chips and salsa (which was alright - not bad not good). Service was okay. Scott checked us frequently and made sure our drinks were filled. We didn't really talk much, no how are you today/is this your first time here etc. But he wasn't rude. He was alright. Anyway we ordered the Chile Verde Shrimp Enchilada, Spicy hot wings, Jalapeno Burger and a pumpkin flan for dessert. We had the green tamales to go as well. For drinks my bf had dos equis and I had a raspberry hibiscus lemonade.  The pumpkin flan and the tamales were outstanding. The rest however, wasn't memorable.   Bad parts:  Ordered hot wings and it seemed we got buffalo flavored wings that was sprinkled by dried chili peppers. (See the picture) Nope, not even hot at all. It was a tad bit overcooked too so it was dry and wasnt juicy/succulent. My shrimp enchilada had the tiny shrimps inside, I know that shrimps are up this season since I work at a restaurant as well so I didn't really mind but the flavor was just lacking. The Mexican rice tasted like it was mixed with 3 cups of butter. I wasn't happy at all. Didn't finish it. My bf had their jalapeno burger and as Ive said in the description of my photo, it tasted like burger king with just salsa on top. The fries though were pretty decent. He didn't finish either. And we were starving when the food arrived.   All in all, sitting on the patio was a major plus but watch out what you order. If it's your first time, better ask what's popular first and probably stick with that. Would come back maybe weeks or a month from now but not so soon. My hope for chain restaurants are seriously dying.",

    "text": "I guess I'm all done now. We went last Friday for a family dinner (6 adults, one 11 yr old), and our server was nowhere to be found through much of the meal.  Our food was brought by someone else (normal) but then we asked other servers and bussers for soda and water refills. ***When the bill came, the charge for soda for us (two people, our son only wanted water) was $18.00*** When she finally can back to pick up the cards, REEEEEEEKING Of cigarette smoke -aha! That's why she was gone the whole night-  I asked very nicely if perhaps all six of the adult's sodas had been added to our bill?  And the server, a young woman, replied that the soda refills are not free.  So every time we had asked someone else to get us a soda, they added it to our bill without mentioning that in a Mexican food restaurant with hot spicy food, the refills are NOW suddenly a charge (been going for more than 20 years so this is recent).  I gently and politely offered that perhaps they should mention that to guests, as this could really be a problem for someone.  We paid our $88 bill for three meals and $18 worth of soda and we left.   It's just... After all the problems we've had in multiple occasions... I just can't. I'm al done.",

Very colorful inside, but, some places here are a bit worn out and could use a bit of sparkle.   We came about 5:20 and had about a 15 min wait. They were quite busy for a Tuesday night. We checked it out upstairs, but it was freezing a cold up there. So we were glad we ate downstairs. We got a nice booth. we had a sweet server. She was very busy, but did her best to keep checking on us. She refilled our salsa and drinks several times. The food was just so so. Not the kind of Macayos we know and love. I had a steak Quesadilla which was a little light on the steak.  Lots of Onions though. T got shrimp enchililadas. She said they were good but, both of us the rice and beans were a little flavorless. All in all good food though, service was great! Thank you Nora!",

A few of my favorites include: tamale bites, red corn chicken taquitos, baja pizza, and large cheese crisp. I've heard the queso dips are pretty fabulous as well.   You can get 1/2 pint of Baja sauce for $2.99 now! If you have ever had the pleasure of eating a Baja Chimi, you know that this is a marvelous announcement. I would swim in that stuff if I could. Though, that is probably highly unrecommended for numerous reasons and I bet it would take A LOT of sauce to fill up a whole pool. That being said, definitely make sure to try the Baja sauce if you have not already had the opportunity to do so.   In my opinion, the best tables in the place are the booths by the windows. Don't forget to watch your step as you are walking up or down the stairs. This has become a bit of a joke between my friends but surely you'll receive the same warning. Just one more example of the great Macayo's customer service. Making sure I do not face plant in a crowded restaurant is rather high on my list so thank you.   No matter when you dine you will receive unlimited chips and salsa and you will get plenty of drink refills. Typically, the food is out fast and pipping hot. On my last visit, food was out in under 10 mins! (We weren't even on our second bowl of chips yet). In the past few years, the menu has been adapting to various dietary needs so they offer gluten free items and (to my delight) calabacitas (their version has corn, zucchini, poblano pepper) have been added to the menu options as well. (Yay!)",

Great amount for the money.  My daughter was a bit upset a hamburger was not on the menu.  i won't ding them for that.  A great reason to visit these guys are; they are locally owned.  Much better chance of your money and taxes staying local.  Everybody wins!!!",

    "text": "We stopped here for supper after a friend recommended this as she's been there before, Im actually visiting from the north east so not familiar with this place at all. I'm hoping my experience tonight was a fluke.....  Let's start with the decor its almost typical, really bright pastel colors, older building. It actually looked like it was going to be fun. We told the hostess we were in for dinner and she asked if we wanted to sit upstairs or down, I didn't know it was two different areas etc. She said there were Tvs upstairs and we could seat ourselves or if we wanted to be seated to sit downstairs, we sat downstairs and that was probably our mistake. The odd thing with the decor is the loft of creepy animals... Hippos, giraffes, zebras etc.. Looked more like an African Safari than a Mexican joint...   The server came over realized she forgot her pen, or someone stole it so she would  be back.. We got a story on how many pens she goes through etc, it was mildly amusing actually. She failed to come back for a bit. We looked up and she was dropping off checks etc. Finally got a beverage and chips and she disappeared again. It was slightly busy so we were understanding for a bit. The manager walked through the dining room looking at the floor instead of the tables so we couldn't even grab him to say we hadn't ordered yet.  Another 5-10 minutes our server noticed us and ran over and wouldn't ya know she still didn't have a pen and couldn't take our order, she went to get a pen or so we thought. We were all slightly annoyed but understanding since the party of 9 behind asked for separate checks.   We finally asked if she was going to take our order and the server actually got another server to wait on us and she said, I won't be able to give you good service so she passed us off to the new server who was definitely a lot better but at this point it's already been a while.  We placed our order and food was out in minutes, my soup had a huge chicken breast in it which was great had I been able to get it on the spoon lol. See pic. It was like half the cup, it was really tasty though so I was pretty stoked. I had the stuffed pablano, which was awesome. My friends had the shrimp chi I which were also awesome.  End of the day the food was good but customer service kinda sucked. I'd go back next time I'm in AZ to give it another shot because of the food",

Seated almost immediately was the most customer service we received.  Our waitress seemed stressed or just not wanting to be there. Didn't not  mentioned any Cinco de Mayo specials. When asked if there was  lunch specials, we were told not on Cinco de Mayo. Sooooo.....we asked asked what the Cinco de Mayo specials were she said \"the  just margaritas.\" She  barely stop by to take our order and then to give receipt. Never an offer to refill drinks or chips & salsa. Truly not the service I remembered. We ordered one drink a refreshing Sherbet Victoria  or so it sounded on the menu. Vanilla ice cream, orange liqueur and vodka ( maybe something else). $7.99 served in the same glass we got our waters in. Tasted odd at first but once the vodka kicked in it was able to be finished.  We ordered cheese crisp with chicken, Baja Pizza with side of guacamole. It was all just ok. Cheese crisp had a surprise tomato dropping that had to be picked off and the guacamole had CHUNKS of unmashed avocado. Baja Pizza was ok but was not hot ....probably sat around a bit too long before brought to us.  The remodeling looked very nice just wished the food and service matched the new look. Sadly disappointed.",

Something to eat while passing the long wait for our lunch.   I ordered a cheese crisp with shredded beef,  it was disgusting the way it was presented.  The meat was so wet that the crisp was no longer crispy.  It was very unappetizing.  Blah! We couldn't get our bill fast enough to get out of there. .. definitely won't return.

You get to choose 4 flavors for $9.99- it's a steal! Within my friend and I, we got the house, peach, mango, strawberry, and wild berry. All amazing.  Service was great. Our waitress Tessa was very kind and we got our food and drinks very fast. Another worker, I believe her name was Ashley, saw that we got the flight and asked if we got her favorite, prickly pear. Unfortunately, we didn't. Not too long after, another worker, Karen, came up and asked us the same. At this point we knew we had to be back to try it out - everyone loves it clearly! And it was to our surprise, Karen came back with a glass for us to try. So incredibly thoughtful for her to do so. And yes, we loved it too!  TLDR; amazing food and plus one service!",

The food came out reasonably quickly for such a packed restaurant. Our server was friendly and even complimented us at the end of the meal for being such a fun group to deal with.  Our group had a good time, very good food, and decent service. About the only problem we had aside from the slow start to the service was the noise level as there were quite a few birthday celebrations throughout which required several servers to sing and clap loudly. It was a little disturbing for people in our party with sensitive hearing, though we all appreciated the friendly party atmosphere.",

I do come here for tasty margaritas and the poblano chicken dinner, which is the only food I've ever ordered from here.  It's a chicken and cheese stuffed poblano pepper, breaded and fried and covered with their bajai sauce.  Now I know the bajai sauce is nothing more than cream (sour cream?), cream cheese and jalapeno juice, but it sure is yummy!  Quite addictive and no way it's good for you, but I just can't help myself.  The chips and salsa they serve when you sit down are good, they offer a mild and a hotter sauce and I like them both just fine.  I love the patio they have overlooking a small \"lake\".  It's a great place to hang out and drink margarita's.  I have always had good service here.  I've been here many times over the years and I'm sure I'll be back again!",

    "text": "Went here on a Thursday night and there was a pretty long wait. When we walked in the lady who appeared to be the hostesses asked how many there were two of us she said it would be just a minute. Well that minute turned into 15 mins. Ok so we sit down and got a waitress who was obviously overwhelmed. She didn't know who was sat first. We told her to take care of the other couple who was sitting next to us. She came back and got our drink order. We were ready to order by then but she didn't ask until after she brought our drinks. Now all if those things aren't necessarily horrible, but that and this made it a bad experience.  She came back to get our food order.  I ordered a cheese enchilada with GREEN saunce no onions. And my boyfriend ordered the sampler platter with NO GUACAMOLE.  Since he is VERY allergic which he told her. So of course we were upset when we received our food. I received a cheese enchilada with RED sauce that tasted old and not good. And my boyfriends food had guacamole.  She dropped iff our food quickly and when she came back and we told her, she said she told them no guacamole and asked if she could take just the item's with it in and remake them.  So she did that but when he got them back they were still cold. When it came to my order she again said I told them green sauce. She said she wrote it down correctly and that I could see her ticket. I don't care if you wrote it down correctly. It obviously wasn't right so why would you bring it? I was starving and we had to pick up our kid so I didn't have mine remade. But the food was just awful. When she came to give us the bill she told us the manger (who we never spoke to nor did they come to apologize) gave us 20% off???  No one apologize for what happened just made excuses. We quickly left and we will be extremely reluctant to return. We have been here multiple times and it's never been bad.  I understand somethings but the way things were handled were horrible",

I was wondering how it would be. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. First off the place is very clean. They still have the same decor that was up 10 to 15 years ago but instead of having an inch of dust on it everything was sparkling clean. Now the booth we sat in had a small tear in the seat and the cushions sunk in a lot when you sit down but that wasn't a big deal. I realized while looking at the menu that I had never had one of their Chimis and they claim to have invented the dish so I guess I better try one. Have to have the specialty of the house because if that is their specialty and it is no good how can anything else be. Their salsa was really good. It had some different things added into it but it worked. I could have filled up on the chips and salsa. Good thing I didn't because the chimi was great. The sauce they put over the top of it was just great. I got the pork but next time I want to try the shredded beef. Even the rice and beans were good. Our server Christine did a great job too. My water and my girlfriend's iced tea glasses were never empty. Plus she was really nice. I don't know about the other locations but I will be back to this one for sure. It is nice to see an Arizona institution still going after all these years. Still making good food too. I was pleasantly surprised. I am happy that this was my 100th review on Yelp. Good place for that milestone.",

One of the restaurants I held up as a standard to judge Macaydon't's against is a little hole in the wall Mexican place near my office.  The food there is less diverse but more authentic and better than Macayshouldn't's and for the price much better.  So if I can get better than Macayno's and more authentic than Macaykeepgoingo's and cheaper than Macaymovealongthere'sbetterandcheaperMexicandowntheroadalittleway's than why I am going to eat there?  They do have a nice outdoor seating area on a pond that features large warning signs about not feeding the birds as well as diners feeding the birds and a live demonstration on the mercenary behavior of birds when they get used to people feeding them and practically land on your plate to grab a peck or two.  The food came out very quickly at Macayhuh's and the service was very good.  Everything slowed to a crawl for some reason when we asked for a box and the check.  Don't get the wrong impression, Macaysosofood's is OK, it's not bad by any stretch.  I would eat here if someone else was buying for sure.  I had a fish taco (overdone) and blue corn enchilada which was OK.",

We asked for a drink menu and were told that they were upstairs. ( we had been sat downstairs) We went to the front and asked for a drink menu, no problem.   The best part of our whole night was the guy who makes balloon animals.   The service was super slow. The waitress never checked to make sure out meals were correct or to see if we needed anything else.  It took forever to get refills.   She brought us boxes for our leftovers than disappeared, while we waited for our check. After about 10 minutes we went to the front to ask for our check. As we had 2 small children we were ready to leave.  We requested split checks. Our fault for not double checking, however the waitress had jumbled the whole thing. My card was charged, then voided ( will update on that), then charged for the correct amount.   Not once had the waitress apologized for her lousy service. Needless to say, we did not tip. I have never been so dissatisfied with a restaurant. Absolutely will NOT return in this lifetime.  After rating a few days (probably because of the credit card company) the original charge that was voided did not process through.",

Drinks were being refilled before we ever noticed they were empty. (Thanks for making us laugh Audra!)   After dinner we all went back downstairs and enjoyed the patio area. Which is a bit hard to find for the first time folks. Use the door by the restrooms to head to the patio. Our patio server was Colby, who was also VERY attentive and quick.   All around had a great time, will be back again and ask for AUDRA and COLBY.",

    "text": "First and last time we will ever eat here. First off, we waited 15 minutes to be greeted on a Sunday afternoon and the place was empty. That was the first sign we should have left. When we finally got our drinks, my water had an awful smell. We decided to give this place the benefit of the doubt, but I will not be drinking anything as the smell ruined it for me. The spinach dip came and the waitress left. The dip was presented on a nice plate with a spoon neatly placed on it. Picked up the spoon and it had old food caked all over the handle and the spoon part itself. The small plates on the table also had dried up food on them. We were disgusted. We waited about 20 minutes before the waitress came back so we can show here. She said \"well, I will let my bust girl know\", after scraping the food off with her fingernails. For some reason, we still decided to wait on the food to try it. It took over an hour for the food to come out. We ordered beef and shrimp fajitas , a beef quesadilla, and two sides of rice. The rice was HORRIBLE. It should be on Fear Factor. It smelled of dog food and tasted as if they cooked it with rotten water. Words cannot describe what we tasted. The beef fajitas consisted of 4 strips of meet that tasted like pure salt and nothing else. The rest of the plate had about 5lbs of veggies on it. The guac and lettuce were brown on both plates. We waited for a while to tell our waitress. Waited some more to tell someone else if we can speak to a manager. You guessed it, we waited again only to ask two more people for a manager. When he finally showed, he apologized and did not charge us. Despite how hungry we were, we lost our appetites for the day.",

    "text": "I will be the first to tell you that I do not eat much Mexican outside of my house or my in-laws house because I get it fresh there. So, while in the Mesa area a group of friends decided to go to Macayos to get some food as half of the group is veg/full vegan and needed a place that has some options for them.  The restaurant was not full at all on a Saturday afternoon and though it was blazing outside the AC made it feel nice and cool inside. Our large group of about 15 was seated quickly and our drink orders were taken super fast. After we were all ready to order our order was taken, then it took about 30 mins for our food to come out. The waitress waited until all of our food was ready, which left me starving, but was a good idea as we were all able to eat together.  I, being the \"Taco Kingpin\", ordered the Chicken Tinga tacos with black beans, spanish rice and guacamole. The tinga was better than I expected. I am not sure if many people know what Tinga is, but it is Chicken marinated with onions and chipotle peppers. This one was not spicy at all, as opposed to homemade versions. Everything was above average, as I like to say, regular restaurant Mexican food.  For dessert our table ordered some deep fried ice cream. I did not try it, but from what I heard it was pretty good and easy to share. Overall it was not bad, I could be bias as I do not Mexican food outside my house, but it was above average Mexican.",

However, never worth anywhere near the $15-25 per person price.  Today we arrived at about 1pm.  The place was not remotely close to what you might call busy.  We were seated immediately.  The hostess brought us chips and salsa immediately.  At about 1.10pm we hadn't even been welcomed or said hello to by our server.  We noticed another  couple leaving with no drinks or even chips on their table.  At 1.15 we gave up and left.  On the way out, the hostess said, \"thanks for coming in!\" knowing we had not been served.  A male server asked if we ordered as we walked out.  I said no, and he said \"K bye!\"",

I finally had to stop the bartender who walked by and ask if someone was going to serve our table. She said I'm just the bartender, and went on explaining she has multiple large party tables to take care of. I guess my party of 4 was not good enough. The guy who finally served us looked like he was about have a panic attack. We asked him for water refills and along with another drink order and he bent over to take a breath and asked  if he could go help the other tables first. DO NOT promote happy hour specials if you cannot keep up with service.",

Then as we were being seated a do different hostess (Jason) set someone else at our table as we are standing there at the table and told the hostess to set us on other end of restaurant. Complete chaos.   I have been going to Macayo's since 1998 and it's typically my go to place.  This is not typically the location I go to, but was on East side of Valley so thought we would try it.   The waitress (a different Nicole who was pregnant) was prompt to get out drink orders, was very personable, and attentive.    The food:  sonoran style Mexican food.  90% of the menu is under $12.00.  The food was hot and delicious. No complaints on the food.",

    "text": "The Demise of a Long Lasting Establishment.  It's a Friday night and with a bustling East Valley restaurant established way long ago you would think there would be a sizable line and wait time to be seated; nope.  We remember the bright colors, unique niche booths, the excitement that McCayo's presented in their dining room; gone.  The remodel is drab, boring, and monotone.  There were empty tables everywhere.  No smiles, just the look of, \"What is this we are eating?\" or \"This isn't what I remembered.\" The salsa used to be amazing; a staple of McCayo's; no more.  It's now a tomato paste consisting if little flavor if any at all.  The wait staff was friendly, but lacking in numbers, as I'm sure as business has declined they've let people go, therefore, service is no longer as prompt.  The food we ordered wasn't as advertised.  I had, according to the menu, \"certified Angus beef with shrimp.\"  The \"beef\" was nothing more than a 3 dollar flank Steak that you can pick up at Safeway.  My meal was to come with a stuffed cheese jalapeno; the jalapeno was placed on a dry piece of cheese.  Most of my plate was black beans and tomatillo; horrible.  The wife got a cheese shrimp combo that consisted of melted velveeta cheese mixed with sour cream and peppers.  The shrimp were drown in a sauce that one could find in a Kraft packet.  We couldn't wait to get out there.  We've both been in the valley since 1973 and have never been more disappointed in a place we once bragged about.  So long McCayo's!  If there's a Jack Kevorkian for restaurants you should find him now.   RIP",

Our reservation was for 7:00pm on a Friday night and we were prepared for them to be busy but the service and the quality of food were both really sub-par.   Our server greeted the 6 of us who came first and took drink orders and all seemed to be fine until the rest of our group showed up (about 20 in total).  Then about 15 minutes went by before we saw our server to take our drink order.  Another 10 before he came back.  Okay, no worries, that was a lot of drinks and chips to get going.  The server comes back and takes our order - an involved process for so many folks.    Then 15-20 minutes.  We'd been there nearly an hour and no food.  My husband asks for our server (who we hadn't seen in a while)... and he comes out to explain that the cooks decided they weren't going to show up that night?!  WHAT? And the managers were back there along with our server trying to make the food?  Wow. Okay.  So he hurries away - and at this point I have to get our toddler home to bed because still we have no food and as I get up to leave here it all comes.    I ordered a salad.  It was bad. It had been sitting for some time - the lettuce was wilted and there was little to no flavor.  I'm also fairly certain the ingredients didn't match what was on the menu but I had to leave so I didn't bother complaining.  I asked the others in our party how the food was and no one seemed impressed, just glad to be finally eating.  Can't recommend this place.",

We sat at a table for 20 minutes before someone came to our table and asked us what we would like to drink. At this point we still didn't have chips and salsa. After we received our drinks (10 minutes later) they finally took our dinner order. My wife ordered the fish tacos and I ordered the regular chimichanga dinner. The fish tacos were supposed to be grilled and it looked steamed and very wet. The tacos fell apart from the wetness of the fish. The chimichanga was average at best and they charged $3.00 extra for about 1 table spoon of guacamole instead of sour cream. In the middle of the night I got sick from the food. We will never eat anything from this place again.",

Food was ok , service was sketchy & men's restroom is under construction so if you are a boy you must potty in a trailer next to the side of the building .. Update -  Came back for a family dinner (i didn't get a say in the restaurant they chose) we were a table of 14. One waitress to serve us plus her other 3 tables.  Needless to say refills of drinks or chips were non existent. Poor kiddos ran out of their one and only cup of soda and that's all they had for the 2 hours it took to ensure the drama that was dinner. Get it together macayos!! And for the love of god I will not be back!  P.s canned fruit cocktail was served as the \"fruit\" side dish on the kids menu!?! Disgusting!! You don't have a single stitch of fresh fruit? Are you kidding ? And they were out of ice cream .. how the heck does this place keep attracting customers ?",

    "text": "ok. i love macayo's, i always have. the food is pretty darn consistent and when i'm going to a chain restaurant, that is what i expect and actually what i want. as per usual, the food was exactly what i had anticipated.  i would have loved to give a 4 or 5 star review on the food, but that's not what this review is really about. THIS is a service review.   Matthew and i went to dinner with my parents last night (Sunday) around 645 and Paul was our server. now, i don't know if he was new or one of those older, jaded servers who think they know everything. sometimes they're hard to tell apart. this guy seemed like he didn't want us or anyone else to be there, like he had better things to be doing than his JOB. if you don't like people, DO NOT BE A SERVER. seriously.  had to ask for refills two separate times after near empty drinks (1\" left in glass) sat for 10 minutes, had to ask for more chips twice, and he dropped Matthew's plate on the way out of the kitchen and said \"did you hear that crash? that was your taco, they're making you another one.\" which took another 10 minutes. oh and my favorite...my dad ordered shrimp fajitas.  the food comes (minus Matthew's) and what kind of fajitas do we receive? beef. i said to my dad, \"didn't you order SHRIMP fajitas?\" he replied that he did in fact do so and stated such to the server. Paul said that was incorrect, that he wrote down beef. my dad said that wasn't what he ordered and that he would indeed like shrimp. so i don't know how you get beef from shrimp, or even steak from shrimp. yes, they're all monosyllabic. but they've got differing vowel sounds and one of those words starts with a different letter even!  he was totally rude and when i go back (it's inevitable, i like their generic food occasionally) i will specifically request to not sit in Paul's section.",

    "text": "Ugh.  Where to start? In Tucson, Macayo's is fabulous.  Here, not so much.  The special tonight must have been shredded beef, because regardless of my husband ordering a chicken burro, and me ordering two ground beef tacos, we both got it.  Not only that, but my side of soup was warm, not even hot enough to need to be blown on.  Speaking of hot, the burro wasn't that either.  There was cheese, still in a clump, and nowhere near melted.  The plate was the only thing served hot.  Super.  My husband also ordered water with lime.  First time, small lime, second time, nothing.  Is it really that hard to remember a piece of fruit to make your tap water taste better?  Sadly, only about 1 time out of every 10 do we ever get decent service where we actually get attention as paying customers, and not forgotten regardless of how busy they are.  They sure were attentive to that manager still wearing his name badge that was sitting behind us though.  Thumbs down Macayo's.",

I was in the mood for a carnitas chimmy.....and well left empty handed and still hungry after an hour of waiting. The bartender and staff seemed pretty overwhelmed the entire time we were there. One waitress was running all over the placing dropping things left and right.  That's It took forever to get chips and salsa. So when the food was taking forever to get to us we asked for more chips and salsa....like 5 times.  When we got frustrated enough from waiting we asked for our tab, but oh yea the bartender was MIA for the 10 minuets so the waitress could not tab us our so the offered a manger.  Oooh look the bartender appeared to apologize and that the manager was going to serve us the food when it was ready....oooooooookay but how long was that going to be. Just super annoyed that one of my favorite places has gone down hill for whatever reason....again I'm pretty disappointed and my chimmy craving is still there.  My boyfriend does not like it when I'm hangry....he says THANKS!!",

Although it was as efficient as it could have been in adding seats, they were able to add a few inside and outside, which of course helps reduce wait times. Also the new look has a nice Hispanic rustic chic look (if that even a real thing) that's way better than the old look.   The food was great all around from price to flavor. Since I'm a sucker for green chile pork, I got their green chile pork stew, which was amazing. It was a little unique vs. traditional green chile pork, but light, fresh and filling.  Our server was probably the best server we've had in 10 years. Super friendly and personable, Johnny on the spot with refills and great with kids. If I remembered her name is totally give her a huge shout out on hear.",

    "text": "Came here with my mom and daughter. This was the 3rd time we came here, and sadly we were still not impressed with the service or the food. First 2 times were \"okay\" and we enjoyed the drinks so much that we figured we would just try something new to eat each visit. We ordered the appetizer and asked for sour cream with it. When the appetizer came out without the sour cream, my daughter asked for it again. About 20-30 minutes later we finally saw the server again and could ask a 3rd time for the sour cream. Now the cheese crisp was cold. Steak fajitas were delivered and the steak was fatty and tough. Our server, Ailsa, was not as attentive as she could be. She told me that she would get me more water, never gave it to me. I had to wait for the ice to melt so I had something to drink because I felt bad asking and asking for that dang sour cream for my daughter. I've been a server before. I know how it can be busy and I know when to \"pick my battles.\" But honestly, she even told me, \"The pitcher is right there. I'll be right back.\" Yet never returned. My other concern was the alcohol beverage. My mom ordered a Strawberry Daiquiri, same way she does every time we have been here. It arrived in a smaller glass than the soda glass, which has never happened at the previous 2 visits to this location. We questioned the server about it, she apologized and asked if she could bring her another one. Ailsa, proceeded to get her another drink in the regular size glass this drink is always served in. Okay, now THAT drink was worth the $7 and we felt satisfied. We finished dinner and were still waiting for our bill when the server advised us the system was going through a reboot and she would have our bill to us shortly. I went to start the car and had my mom take care of the payment. When Mom brought out the receipt, I was shocked to see the total. Never were we charged for requesting sour cream in the past (wasn't told that we would be either) and was charged $7 for EACH of the drinks when the first one was half the size of the second. Wasn't expecting to have to pay for two when the server offered to get another one in the proper sized glass. Overall, I guess what prompted the review was because it's a Sunday night. It wasn't very busy. Things could have been a bit different. I know we will be back to try again because my mom really enjoys Macayo's but hopefully we will have a better experience.",

I made arrangements to have one dozen white roses delivered to my wife. I called and made arrangements with the manager Mark to have the flowers brought out while we dined. 45 minutes into dinner I received a message that the person who was to deliver the roses became sick, overslept etc and the flowers were not being sent.  Mark and two staff members,  Cierra and Carla found out what happened. Mark sent Cierra to a florist and purchased one dozen white roses and brought them to our table. To top things off, I had to later insist that they add the price of the flowers to the tab. Not only was the food and service great but what Mark, Cierra and Carla did was the absolutely most thoughtful act I have ever had done at a restaurant. I will recommend this restaurant to everyone I know!!  Sincerely, Hondo Hunter",

The service was very quick and my drink was never empty. I got the shredded beef taco which had the perfect amount of crunch and the beans and rice were seasoned beautifully. I would have given it five stars but after I started eating there was a big ole beetle climbing on the wall and after that I was definitely done eating. It was probably just unlikely fluke but it grossed me out. I'll be back anyways to get the huge margaritas!",

They come with a helping of purple cabbage and pick de gallo. With a side of sour cream, guacamole, salsa, and salsa with jalapenos. They were tasty but, now I realize why a lot of these New Mexican restaurants use two corn tortillas instead of one. The corn tortilla doesn't hold it together as well as two. I can only give them a three star. Maybe next time I will try other items.",

When the bill came out we were charged for a side of sauce we didn't ask for (my companion added for extra sauce to their entree which it was). My friend inquired as to Mitch's lack of acknowledgement of the meal error. He simply replied, let me get my manager. We spoke to the manager who took the side of sauce off, which we requested, and comp'ed the meal 20%. Needless to say Mitch didn't get a great tip and hopefully his manger spoke to him about the mediocre service we received. The food was delicious as always.",

    "text": "If I could give this no stars I would. Apparently this is not a place where you can go after a day's work on Friday afternoon. FIRST they would let kids sit upstairs in the bar area!!! After getting past that my party of 5 ordered rounds of drinks and food.  This is where things took a turn for the worse. 1. The waitress took our order for 3 more beers and more chips 2. The manager comes over about 20 mins later and asks if everything is ok. We say yes but we haven't gotten our drinks yet. The manager stumbles over his words and then says the guy at our table has been cut off by the server (mind you he is about 5'10 and 250 and had 4 drinks over 3 hours AND ate food).  By no means was he drunk or being rude or obnoxious. 3. The manager comes back about 5 mins later with the food the guy who was cut off ordered. We sent it back and asked for the check. The manager came back with 1 check, when we asked the waitress upon sitting down to split the checks since we knew we would all be paying separate.  Plus the waitress never took off the sangria which was sent back after 1 sip due to being gross.  4. We got our checks separately and after 10 more minutes and no manager or waitress in site I brought our checks to the bar with all the cards and requested to pay.  5. 10 more mins go by and still no manager or waitress. The bartender eventually brings back the checks and cards. 6. The waitress managed to avoid our table for more than 45 mins with nothing to say.  Moral of the story, if your going to cut people off please train your staff to do it appropriately and respectfully. If it is the policy of your establishment to do so after so many drinks just say so. Don't avoid the table altogether and make them feel like CRAP.  I will NEVER go back to ANY Macayos establishment ever again. If I want Mexican food I will go to GARCIAS, MANUELS, or VALLE DE LUNA as the food at Macayos is nothing spectacular and I'm sure I can find better customer service elsewhere!!!!!!",

Instead of saying in front of daughter-in-law do you do birthdays? I went to the hostess station and asked the hostess because I wanted it more a surprise and not be so obvious. The hostess said sure she will tell my waitress. Ok we are done eating, sitting around waiting and the waitress brings the check. I am stumped, I'm thinking \"what happened to the little birthday surprise\"? So I go back up and talked to the hostess, she told me she told the waitress and would tell her again. At this point I said never mind I will just ask her. So I ask the waitress if the hostess told her and she said no, and I believe her by her reaction. She said but we can. I said \"please\". After like 20 minutes we are like did they have to bake the cake or what? She finally brings out this pathetic little desert. 2 little air puffed things with whip cream and honey. And she lit the candle in front of her. I was very disappointed. I wish I would have been told what it was and next time I will ask where ever I go. Because I would have rather have paid for something like Fried Ice cream. Nice place to eat - Not so great in trying to make it a little more special for the birthday guest. Spent a lot of money and just disappointed yesterday. I will go back as their food is good. But don't ask for the birthday special - Pathetic, hassle, waste of time.",

    "text": "So, went here to give it a try for a second time. I had a bad experience in January and gave them another shot here last weekend. I would say the biggest complaint I have is the margarita! The server, of course, does the \"upsell\" on the Don Julio Tequila. The drink is over $10. The drink is watery, and bland. I didn't even finish it. I tried to get the attention of the manager, but he was pre-occupied with another table, in which he had a lengthy conversation at. (Must be friends with these people), because he even bent down to have the conversation, which I would say lasted well over 10 minutes. I had the same server I had in January. In January, we were told the wait would only be 30-40 minutes. Well, 30-40 minutes later we were still waiting. I realize we had 6 people with our party, but no mention of other accommodations were made, i.e., patio, or upstairs. Once the wait continued to be 50 minutes +, I asked about outside and we were then told there was seating available out there. Once outside, we were only given menus, chips and salsa and water. The waiter took our drink order but did not return for a lengthy period of time. We had another person we were waiting for, so the waiter returned with the drinks. He did not ask us if we wanted any appetizers or to order, in fact, he \"assumed\" that we were just going to wait and put the order in when our last guest arrived. Since that was NOT the case, I could not find him to tell him. I had to go inside and find the manager. The manager came out and handled the issue- I will give him that, but when the server came back, he complained that \"he was going to get a spanking\" from the manager as now he would be in trouble. He also put the blame on US, saying that we had not communicated to him that we were fine to order without our friend being there. The only thing \"comp'd\" that night were the cheese crisps. So, based on all of that, I did try Macayo's again last weekend. I unfortunately, got the same server. I did not see any improvement to his service, lack of attention to detail, and as I already mentioned, the margarita's sucked. It was the worst margarita I have had in my life. I will NOT be returning to Macayo's, especially when the Valley has so many other great Mexican restaurants to choose from.",

The food is still great so I continue to go but I REALLY miss the \"old\" Macayos!  Most surprising is the large stained glass \"macayo\" (macaw) for which the place was named - they removed it with the remodel!!  They no longer have the mints that I always enjoyed after the meal.  Bring back the old Macayos - or at least the big stained glass art!!",

The renovation turned out horrible and makes the atmosphere so bland and depressing. We witnessed 2 guests and 3 separate staff members hitting their heads on the new lamps. Just seems to be an upward, uncomfortable environment now. More importantly, the menu selections, taste and salsa have changed.  Just as bland as the decor. Why did they mess with it? We certainly will not be going back.",

On the good side, the place is very colorfully decorated....lots of bright colors, and plenty of decor to match.  The service was wonderful, and I enjoyed myself while I was here.  The down side, is that I found the food a bit pricy, and I wasn't all that impressed.  I ordered 2 tacos and a cup of tortilla chicken soup.  The cup was rather tiny, and was a bit disappointed with the small portion.  It was good, but a bit spicy for my taste.  The tacos were good, but honestly, Ive gotten bigger, better tasting tacos from Filbertos at half the price.  I could see myself coming here more as a happy hour guest, or bringing some out of town friends here to enjoy the decor and get a taste for some of thier food, but not as a regular customer.  I don't think its bad, I just feel that the food was just okay and it was a bit overpriced for what I felt like I got.",

Maybe because it's been around forever and they're the kind of people that won't ever branch out and try something new.  This place was okay back in the day but has suffered a serious decline.  PEOPLE!  We live close to the border.  There are plenty of excellent, authentic Mexican restaurants in the valley.  Macayos is to Mexican as Olive Garden is to Italian: a bland, Americanized, chain restaurant version of international food.  The food is nothing special.  When asked what ingredients were in the salsa a waiter responded, \"I don't know, the salsa comes from a can.\"  I can never say that I've had great service here.  One waitress in the bar broke my friend's older \"Senor Bob\" margarita glass, didn't apologize and just gave him a new one.  When he pointed out that the new ones are much smaller her response was, \"You get the same amount of tequila in both.\"  Which is not True and leads to another point.  The margaritas here have become downright horrible.  I watched the bartender fill margarita glasses with a pre-made pitcher of watered down sweet and sour mix lightly spiked with cheap tequila.  It's sad that I can't even force myself to come here, given that it's walking distance from my house and they have a nice patio on the lake.  But after many worsening experiences I have given up on this place and won't return.",

Macayo's also has my favorite salad, the Fiesta Salad with chicken! I love the simple ingredients with the cilantro lime sauce, so yummy!!

Called doordash and it wasn't even them but they still credited the money back to us.

We waited like half an hour for chips and water. Finally when our waiter came to take the order, we had some special requests based on some of us being vegan. He was semi-irritated about that. Well guess what. He never came back. In fact, we saw him sling a backpack over his shoulder and walk out. Found out he had actually quit on the job. A table full of people came and sat next to us. They all had chips, waters, bevs & apps before we even got our stuff.   I'll give the mgr credit for apologizing. She I believe had just started her shift after the waiter quit so it took a minute for her to find out about that. She gave a percentage off to my friend who paid, but with all of that the whole meal should've been free. Felt bad for the rest of the staff having to deal with Easter crowds, short that waiter, but dude. This place has great food but I would not go on a holiday!",

Let me start by saying I have been a chef for over 24 years and by far have a handful of complaints but this place really got to me. First off the service needs a lot of attention please teach the staff how to properly greet someone, and to take food orders. I had to walk in the back where they are cooking and ask for a side of warmed up sauce on the fly which means quickly. As I did that a Manager saw me and then came to my table to ask me what the problem was they screwed all my food up from the start so I was already upset who puts cold sauce on a hot chimichanga makes no sense. They don't have bad food just crappy crappy service",

Make empty slurping sound with your drink straw, as you stair at your waiter, or try waving the empty chip bowl. Just what ever you do DON'T throw it. You'll never get service after that. Talking from experience here. Yeah well sorry Mr. Waiter. 15 minutes to get seated, another 20 minutes for you to ask me if I have ordered, then 15 more minutes for you to bring me a drink and chip/salsa. And yes 30 more minutes to bring the food and 1st refill. So, after an hour and 20 minute the food! Hallelujah!! It's worth the wait. Everything on the menu is very good. The chicken stuff poblano is my favorite. And try the spinach con queso dip.  Maybe the waiter was just having a bad day. I will definitely be going back with hopeful intentions.",

Throughout the planning and the actual day of the wedding, Dale, Jose, April and the staff there were more than amazing. Dale,Jose and April made sure than ANYTHING I needed and asked for was done. We cant thank them enough for the PERFECT wedding day that we had on September 3rd 2016!!",

On Black Friday, we knew restaurants could be packed because of hungry shoppers taking a break from their door buster deals.  I reluctantly went back to Macayo's and I'm glad I did.  Whatever beef they were using before is back to the original and the menu items tasted just like I remembered it.  This time I ordered the shredded beef Macayo Chimi with rice and beans and oh was it good!  I barely finished my plate and I was relieved the quality of food had returned.  Our server tonight was Ken and he rocked it.  He made sure our glasses were full and he served our food real quick and we had everything we wanted.  Even at the end he noticed my Father-In-Law's name on the credit card (he paid the bill) and said \"Thank You Mr. Rausin for dining with us tonight.\"  That was a nice added touch.  He really seemed like he cared about his customers.  We've never had bad service at this location.  My faith in Macayo's is restored and I will be back!",

Macayo's had a no wait so we scooted right in. Waiter was ok. I ordered a carne asada chimi Beloved ordered a carnitas plate. The wait for food was reasonable, however the beans were overcooked both rice n beans super dry the chimi has a sauce that seen better days Beloved didn't fare much better same issue with beans n rice The carnitas were large chunks of beef that I could see from across the table that they were very dry. Carnitas could have greatly benefited from a sauce to make them platable.    My two cents No Mas",

    "text": "Macayo's was very busy. Sunday night. There were a few tables open so we asked to sit at the one facing the patio with the lake view. The hostess was very accomadating & sat us at the requested table. Our server was at our table quickly & took our drink order. K & I decided we were going to try the \"3 course meal for $10.99\" offer. This is a pretty good deal. You start with either tortilla soup or salad. Then pick one of the 4 entrees & finish with one of the two desserts. K went with Tortilla soup, Shredded Beef Mexican Flag Chimichanga (sauces on the side) & fried ice cream. This is where it got interesting. K asked if she could sub additional Baja sauce for the green sauce but was told no. She could however order the sauces on the side with additional Baja sauce. Huh? Our server politely pointed to the small print on the menu that read \"No substitutions, Thank You\". Geeze. I'm starting to get flashbacks of our dinner at Abuelo's. Unless these are pre-made, why can't the cook scoop an addional blob of Baja sauce instead of a laddle of red sauce? Monkey's... I know it's Monkey's. K said the Tortilla soup was not overly spicy with a nice rich flavor. Her Flag Chimi was tasty, plenty of filling and extra yummy with the extra baja sauce. K really enjoyed the fried ice cream. A scoop of Dryers quality Vanilla ice cream rolled in a crunchy corn flake and cinnamon type coating & fried. Topped with a drizzle of honey. Yummy goodness. I ordered the salad, Green Chile Pork Stew & fried ice cream. The salad was a decent little salad. Really a perfect starter. The pork stew had chunks of pork with Poblano pepper, tomatillo, Jalapeno, onion & cilantro. It came with 2 flour tortillas. Yummy. Really a good stew. I gave my ice cream to C. C wanted his new favorite Mexican dish... Steak & cheese, toss in a tortilla if you must. Well looky there, on the 3 course menu is a Grilled steak quesadilla. Perfect. Or so we thought. C asked if they could leave off the chopped up vegetable medley sprinkled on the top. Our server politely pointed out that there is also chopped up veggies (onions & peppers) INSIDE the quesadilla AND again pointed to the \"No substitutions\" note on the 3 course menu. Monkey's. &@$# Monkey's. So we scrapped that idea & went with the Carne Asada Burro without the pico de gallo. $11.49. Since this is on the regular dinner menu our server said we could make any necessary changes we wanted. C loved the burro. The carne asada was cut into decent sized chunks, very flavorful & not at all chewy. Winner, winner, steak burro dinner. We took the rice & beans to go. C loved my fried ice cream but was not a fan of the honey drizzle. In the end we all loved our food. A policy is a policy so I can't really complain. Good food. Polite service. Fair pricing. 4 Stars.",

I never come to this area and didn't know about this location, but I really like the way it's set-up. It's two stories, with lots of seating downstairs. From what I could tell the upstairs is mostly a bar area. There's a really nice patio downstairs that overlooks a lake. It was August when we were here, but this looked like a nice area to sit weather permitting.   The lunch menu a Macayo's is pretty simple, inexpensive for all you get and good. It's basically different combinations of tacos, burritos & enchiladas w/rice & beans on the side. I got a shredded beef burrito enchilada style w/red sauce. The beef was very good and there was a lot of it. The red sauce was good as well. I don't think Macayo's has the best Mexican food in the world, but it's solid enough.  It was pretty empty when we came, but our server was very friendly and our food came out fast.   I would like to come back here for Happy Hour. They have it every day (I think it's at different times on the weekend versus weekdays), and the specials look good.",

    "text": "Blast from the past, ayyyyye! Seriously. This place screams Arizona nostalgia. Macayo's originally opened in 1946 on McDowell Rd. and then sometime in the early 80s, the Mesa location was erected when Dobson Ranch was the new, up and coming neighborhood in Mesa. It's a classic that everyone knows about and this location has some beautiful lake views, an upstairs bar with open seating and a small balcony to enjoy your meal and margaritas.   People are super friendly, from the hostess to the bartender. They always have smiles on their faces and are helpful. Now, while it is comfy, cozy nostalgia with a family feel, be prepared to see some of the older patrons that have probably been coming here for the past 35 years. I mean, I feel like one day this could be my happy hour spot after I retire, and me and my girlfriends will order shots and push each other out in our wheelchairs laughing, but it will be OK because we've got Depends.  Now that we got that visual out of the way, let me just wrap it up with some highlights: the cheese crisp: good (and FREE If you check in on Yelp). The frijoles (beans for you transplants): good, a bit salty, but good. The enchiladas and tacos: MEH...yes meh is an adjective. Service: great! Location: beautiful lakeside restaurant with a unique setup. Prices: a bit steep given the food is average. I say give it a chance. Some of y'all have never gone to a mediocre Mexican restaurant to drink tacos and eat tequila and it shows. Don't judge me.",

I was really looking to get a chicken poblano and I was told they have a pretty tasty poblano. When I got the plate, the poblano is much larger than what ive had. It's got that nice crispy outside with a red and white sauce packed with chicken. I did feel it was good but not the best poblano I've had. I feel the sauce was a little weak and didn't have enough flavor to it and the white sauce seemed to lack flavor also. The beans were good but nothing special to them. Good chips and the salsa wasn't anything too special either  All around it's an ok place for Mexican based on what I ordered. I did enjoy the service and the environment more than anything",

We visited on Sunday after attending a baseball game.  We sat outside as our guests were from MN and wanted to soak up as much AZ weather as possible.  The servers covering the patio also had tables inside.  I think they need to rethink this as the service we received was lacking all night.  We waited a very long time for every thing - drinks, apps, entrees and most especially the bill.",

My husband and I absolutely love their food, and especially the Tres Rellenos (3 peppers stuffed with chicken, pork or cheese.) The atmosphere is bright and cheery, fresh and clean looking...and quiet. The service is great too. We like the one at 48th and Warner Rd, but I started at the one on Central and McDowell in the 60s! Their fabulous, flash-blended (not frozen) margaritas are delicious. I'm really baffled by some of the negative reviews. We must have eaten there 50 times, just in the last year and have never had bad service or disappointing food. Hmmm.  So trust this review! It's a great place to relax, eat and enjoy a \"Killer adult beverage\" (as my husband calls it.)",

We went upstairs to sit at the bar, there were still 4 tables of people sitting in the bar area.  We sat down and it was very clear that the bartender was annoyed.  He was trying to close early and get out of there and was very rude and short with us.  There was a table of people that was trying to get his attention to get boxes for their leftovers but he was clearly ignoring them.  The bartender had a friend sitting at the very back of the bar that he was joking with and making comments to.    The people that were trying to get his attention finally had to come to the bar to ask for takeout boxes and had to come back again to pay, as he was still ignoring them.  My wife and I had finished our round of drinks and wanted another but he was ignoring us as we sat at the bar.  I finally yelled to him to get me another one but my wife was feeling out of place and wanted to leave.  It was only 9:00 at that point and the place still had an hour to go.  Really, the guy clearly does not like working those hours and takes it out on the patrons.  He was acting like a spoiled teenager that was being told to do something against his will.  Macayos needs to correct the situation either by getting this guy help or reassigning his hours.  By the way, the food was great as always.",

Food arrived rather quickly but then we had no silverware or napkins to eat so the waiter had to apparently go to the store to buy it. Food was good tho.

Our food took almost an hour to come out. Not all of our margarita flights were filled all the way.   The food, on the other hand, never fails! I ordered the beef chimichanga with all rice.

    "text": "Absolutely terrible experience. It took over an hour for my family to get our meal, from the time we say down in a restaurant that was not particularly busy. Our waiter took his title seriously, waiting at least 30 minutes before taking our order, this while serving a group that included 3 children 5 and younger. Needless to say the kids got restless before we ordered, much less before we got our food, and by the time I was done eating had moved to whatever comes after restless.   Part of the problem, no doubt, was that it took me so long to eat simply because my meal was particularly awful . In fact, had the children not already been climbing the walls, I would have sent my chili rellenos back and gotten something else, because I have never seen this dish so viciously murdered in my life. In my experience this dish is a lightly battered pepper, filled with cheese and then fried. What I received was two peppers amidst a loaf of fried bread batter, more along the lines of donuts with peppers stuffed in them. To make matters worse the fried batter had no traces of crispness, I don't know the reason, but I'm pretty sure it has something to do with where they stored this dish before preparing it to serve as what their menu calls hand dipped fresh daily. Where would that have been? Most certainly the freezer. How could I tell? You know that flavor that permeates frozen food that has spent too long in the company of other random frozen items? That was the only flavor I could taste in that massive chili stuffed donut they served me.   Needless to say, I wouldn't eat here again, and I don't suggest you do either. With the number of quality Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area, why consider going to one where you might get even moderately bad service, much less one where you'll wait an hour to get warmed up frozen food?",

This after the waitress stated that it was already \"plated\".  By 1250 we were running out the door with food not eaten and late to find out one of the orders was missing.  The chips are stale.  I know I'll never be back.  There's too many Mexican restaurants out here to have to revisit a bad one.  Pretty sure my coworkers won't be back either.  The reason for one star is the place was clean.",

The customer chatting away on her cell phone put her finger in my green corn tamale a few times complaining 'this isn't my food' and when she finally decided to quick playing with my food, told the server it wasn't her order the server attempted to then serve it to me! I told the server that the other lady put her finger in it a few times so I couldn't accept my food. She took it to the kitchen to be remade. My order came out on same red plate that was originally presented to me. The plate itself was piping hot with extra sauce on the tamale than the last one but food was room temperature. My boyfriend's food was also room temperature and his side of french fries a total of 13 were soggy. The server even noticed there were very few french fries on the plate and said she'd bring out another order. We were starving at this point so I ate around the end of the tamale that I felt to be still compromised and my boyfriend ate his room temperature overcooked steak but left the 13 soggy french fries. The second order of fries never made it out to our table...may have gone to another table and we were just ready for our check. While waiting we called a manager over to inform him (Brian) what had happened so it wouldn't happen to another customer in the future. Brian swore up and down he personally threw my food out and the food I now had was all freshly prepared. He apologized profusely about the second order of fries never arriving and the entire experience. Brian removed both our meals and my second untouched Patron margarita from our bill. I've come to this location several times and it has never been like this. We shall return after their remodel and give them another chance!",

    "text": "Dear Macayo's,   I would like to thank you for renewing my hatred for your bland, artery busting Meximerican food. I hadn't experienced your brand of deep fried crap since I came of majority and stopped dined out with the family at restaurants that specialized in satisfying even the blandest of palettes. I must say, you continue to exceed my wildest expectations in that respect! I had to continue looking down at my plate just to make sure the 3,000+ calories I was consuming were more than just a mirage of Mexican food.  I will admit that I have a long standing, simmering hatred for you, Macayo's. So maybe this biases my opinion a bit. I can't in my right mind fathom why I thought you deserved a second chance last night. I think it's testament to the fact that sometimes I make super stupid decisions on an empty stomach, especially when I'm hungry enough to eat the ass end out of week dead burro. I suppose I was expecting something a bit more appetizing than that stretch of hyperbole. How wrong I was.  Your patio was the highlight of the evening. It's backed up against a lake and there was a duck that watched me eat. He had a shiny green head. It was nice. I made him my zen when all I wanted to do was lash out in frustration over the meal. If I could offer a suggestion to benefit both the duck and myself, perhaps you could pipe some music out onto the patio, because listening to Suzie and Sally Suburb bitch about their waistlines while committing refried sin was pretty grating.  The food however, far outshone those cackling soccer moms in terms of annoyance. I don't know who you think you are, Macayo's, but charging 10-15 bucks an entree at your establishment just about gave me a heart attack long before the lard had a chance to bully up on my arteries. Maybe it's because I think you have the street value of a gum job from a run down whore, but I have to say that those prices were shocking. I could travel the valley over and find better Mexican food for much cheaper. For that price, I expect outstanding quality and taste, or at least a hip see and be seen environment. All you have is a duck working in your favor.   I do have a serious question for you though, what's with smothering your entrees in cream cheese and trying to pass it off as Baja sauce? It was the same jalapeno spread I get on my bagel in the morning, but with even less heat and flavor. I suggest renaming it Manhattan sauce in honor of the bagel and schmear capital of the nation, and I think it would be a touching homage to the Pace Picante \"New York City?!\" commercials.   I also can't understand why the majority of your entrees offer either rice or beans, but few have these in conjunction. Those are universal standards at a Mexican food joint, and the ultimate test of quality since they're comparable the valley over. Do they bring you shame? Is that why you don't want to offer them both? Or are you just a cheap nickel and diming motherfucker, Macayo's?   I'm more apt to believe the latter, because you charged me two bucks for guacamole without informing me that it cost extra. Then you delivered a pile of gelatinous green goop of questionable origin that had absolutely zero flavor. By this point in the meal I really shouldn't have been surprised at how bland everything was, because I was on to your ploy of substituting flavor for gobs of cream cheese and a heavy hand with the salt shaker. But despite stiff competition from the bland pico de gallo and the puzzling \"Baja sauce\", it was the shitamole took the grad prize of suckdom for the evening. I have never tasted weaker guac. You must have used some terrible avocados and whipped them with corn syrup or some other food-like filler. There wasn't a zing of cilantro or lemon juice, no hint of Serrano spiciness, not even the tang of some onion, although I did see a couple soggy tomatoes bits added for color.   I don't think I will ever be coming back, Macayo's. It's not you, it's... I can't lie; even to spare your feelings. It's you. It's all you. I'm breaking up in a public setting because I'm scared that you'll key my car while by back is turned, or at the least smother it in cream cheese. I know you're into that freaky shit.  Wishing you deep fried broken dreams, Erica",

    "text": "When planning our weekly Saturday night date my husband and I wanted to try Macayos in Mesa mainly for the location on the water, a chance to enjoy the view and some good food and one another's company after a long week. I had been to the restaurant before and he had not so we were excited to give it a try. We sat outside off to the west side. There was a large party to the left and right of us. The party to the left were only there for a short time but the party to the right, that had numerous children, literally took over our dinner and ruined our entire night. First of all three of the children sat directly between the water and our table screaming at the ducks, ruining our view and distrubing our dinner. And that was only the beginning. Shortly thereafter 6 other children from the party began to climb on the stairway rail that was literally 3 feet  from our table. We were in the middle of a jungle gym and they were running and screaming all around us. Now I understand this was the fault of their very rude parents for not caring that their unruly children were ruining our night along with every other diner outside. But what makes me mad is the employee response. They knew what was going on and simply didn't care. Our waiter said and did nothing even after he obviously saw how annoying the situation was and how aggravated we were when we asked for our check right away and handed him our card so we could get out of there immediately. I went up to the hostess station on the way out and told all four of the employees up there that they shouldn't seat anyone else outside since there were unruly children climbing all over the back area and that they had ruined our night and our dinner. Even though I was obviously visibly upset the main hostess said \"there was only so much they could say\" (to the other party) and she didn't offer an apology nor an opportunity to speak to a manager about our unhappiness. Talk about poor customer service! Thank you for ruining our night and wasting $60 of our hard earned dollars!",

    "text": "Haha, okay, I am obviously the odd one out here. I was both surprised but not at the same time when I saw how low the average reviews for this restaurant are. Surprised becasue this is my favorite sit down Mexican restaurant. Not surprised since I know usually half of the people I know don't care for the food here as they find it to be more of an American take on traditional Mexican dishes. I really like the food here. It is always consistent and super yummers! The three things very important to me in Mexican cuisine are the beans and rice and of course the chips & salsa. You usually get these as a side with every Mexican dish, so they better be good. Their beans are always piping hot and creamy and their rice is super flavorful and extremely moist! Their chips and salsa are delicioso! Chips are served hot and this salsa is very unique and has a garlicy flavor. May sound weird in writing but it is phenomenal when you're eating it (bring gum for afterwards if you're on a date) ;-)  I have liked every dish I have tried here. There combination plates are great because they actually give you a ton of choices! Sides and entrees. Most places will give you a small list of options, it makes it very limited for vegetarians too. When I used to eat meat, I loved their shredded beef tacos! I would get soft tacos, corn tortillas. Very moist and tender. I really like their burritos, all of their enchiladas, their green chile and corn tamale, and so so so much more! Their baja sauce is this creamy, cheesy, spicy sauce that you can get on your food or for your chips. Wowza! I have not had a bad food experience here...an occasional service experience or two when they were really swamped but I will remain a loyal customer. Thank you for your yummy food!",

They didn't deliver the sopapillas (the restaurant was completely out of sopapillas...that would have been nice to know when I ordered it instead of finding out once it was delivered, sort of makes it hard to change the order at that time.  They also completely forgot the tacos I ordered (an oversight that the girl at Macayo's front desk admitted to).  To top it off, I over paid (8 bucks) for guacamole that barely covered 6 chips (see picture).   Food was decent otherwise, but there are too many other good alternatives in the area so I'll go elsewhere next time.",

To our surprise though they got us sat within 10 minutes! The staff was super busy and we got just slightly over looked, but they were amazing about and gave us a free appetizer. Everyone from the managers to the servers was super nice and friendly.  So I'm a bit of a tamale snob. I love them! I had a two tamale plate one with red sauce and one with baja sauce....thy were amazing. Two of the best tamales I've ever had. I would definitely recommend the baja sauce, was sweet and spicy, though both were great.  So my wife had a great first experience and even though they were super busy and I was a little hectic, they got us sat quickly and was super accommodating for any inconvenience! We will be back.",

    "text": "This place has pretty good food. I had tortilla soup which I'd never had before but loved it. I also ordered some tortillas but they were mostly charred. I also had some mini chimis and they were ok. Bit dry.  I docked it two stars however because of the way the servers are forced to work. I was with big parties both nights I was there, and the restaurant seats them and has no manpower to take care of them if it's at all busy.   The first night, my server Fannie was an absolute sweetheart. I told the manager and he said that he'd only been there 5 days and had already added her as \"one of his favorites\". I'm sorry dude, you're nice and everything but five days in you shouldn't already be having favorites. I mean Fannie should be everyone's favorite but hold your judgement for a couple weeks man! You don't even know your staff yet! He also said that if I wrote a good review about her she would get a chance to join a raffle for free work uniforms and stuff like that. That seems wrong to me. Uniforms should be paid for by the jobs anyway. (I should know, because mine aren't either and it's bull. How are you gunna make someone pay to work at a place?!)   Anyway both nights the place was understaffed and the servers had good poker faces but they were drowning. It took forever just to take our orders because the servers were stretched so thin. Then the food took forever because there weren't enough cooks.   In all it took over half an hour to get me some water (the second night, I don't know who that server was but it wasn't Fannie! That angel kept me and my friends quenched! But I know the second server was also in over his head with customers poor thing)   And over an hour to get food. So I would definitely recommend this place in small groups and either on slow hours or with patience.   I would also recommend people to start applying here and help these servers out! You rock Fannie. You deserve better.",

My family ordered veggie enchiladas and they were atrocious. My sister ordered the mini chimis and they were undercooked and not filled with anything. The only reason I gave this place deserves a star is their margaritas were ok. I had a flight and they were way too sweet. To be honest, as Mexican food in Arizona go, go anywhere else.

CONS - The music seemed very loud, maybe it was just where we were sitting - The server did not write any of our orders down, which worried me, and rightfully so, since she got 2 of the 3 orders wrong =/ - She told us the food was not spicy and was kid friendly - IT WAS SO SPICY!! - She tried to charge us additional for the extra food she brought out, due to her taking the order completely wrong - LOL!!! - She refilled mine and my wifes drinks with the wrong beverages  Macayo's itself was ok, but the server - not so much..

Sometimes the portions are huge, other times, such as the lunch specials, they are what one would expect for $7.99.    The last time we went, my son loved the nachos supreme, and my \"flauta de Mexico\" was particularly tasty.  The dessert flan deserves 4 stars, a light custard flavor with plenty of caramel sauce.    The setting for this particular Macayo's gets 5 stars.  Not only is the inside colorful and visually interesting, but there is a large man-made lake with patio seating.  A very pretty and relaxing setting.",

Not only did you not bring us chips you didn't take the time to check in on us or even serve our table. You seemed too busy with the other people and didn't bother to pay attention. You were rude from the beginning and it was nice to see that you took our money and gave us change out of your own pocket rather than the cash register. DO NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION, this is the reason this chain is dying is because of horrible service and ignorant employees. If I could give you no stars I would since your service doesn't even deserve one! TO MANAGEMENT, if you keep this trash employee be prepared for more bad reviews from other people who agree!",

We arrived a little before 4pm And they did not appear to be overly busy. 3/4 of our order was salads so I am not sure what took so long.

The salad, which was my first course, was pretty good. Our waiter rubbed me the wrong way early on, however, when I asked him what dressings they offered. He rolled his eyes at me and asked me if I wanted something creamy or something like Italian \"cuz I don't wanna stand here and name them all.\" Excuse me, is that not part of your job to tell patrons what their salad dressing choices are?! I didn't understand the big deal, especially after he eventually rattled off all the dressings in fewer than five seconds. The food was delivered quickly, which was impressive. Granted the restaurant was far from packed on the particular Wednesday we went for an early dinner. My second course was a chicken dish. It was supposed to be spicy, but was far from it. The portion size was decent, though. Rice, beans, salsa...All average taste, not spectacular by any means. My third course, the pumpkin flan, was delicious. I just wish the size of the flan they served me was doubled. So puny! Am I in a rush to get back here? No. Did I hate it? No. At least I know which dressing I will be ordering for my salad whenever I go to Macayo's next so I won't be inconveniencing our server!",

It's inauthentic and makes you feel like crap after you eat it.  I like the idea of the restaurant with all the bright colors and the cool patio, but the place is actually really dirty.

It took 45 minutes to get our food. This was on a Thursday & NOT busy, resturant was 1/2 empty. After getting our food so late, it was the wrong meal we ordered Shredded Beef and both of us got chicken ! The waitress never cleared any of our dirty plates from a appetizer we had ordered and ate, so we had all the dirty plates the entire time . The pepsi tasted flat, with no fizz. The manager never came over to ask or apologize about the wrong food & how long it took. After paying cash for my bill, the waitress kept my change !! We had asked for the manager after we walked up front to leave. Took forever for him to come out, then when he did, VERY UNPROFESSIONAL looking manager Looked like some bum off the street. He was not very caring or sincere to us after we explained how our dining experience was. All he said was I'll put you on a list in a book if you come back to get a free meal, YUCK !!

My wife loves it and with that, I'm bound to make an appearance once a week.   My two items that I rotate here are the California burrito, and the Cheeseburger. The burrito is the closest thing here I can get to Chipotle which I love, and the burger, well it's pretty good, but nothing special. The hidden gem here is the french fries. Man those are good. Cooked in the same oil as the tortilla chips, it really brings a different flavor to the fries.   One thing I can say about this restaurant that I love? The excellent customer service. I've never had a bad waiter or waitress and the manager is very involved in the customers experience as he does ask everyone if they've enjoyed themselves and if there is anything he can do to make it better.  That alone makes me want to come back.  And who knows, I might try something else on the menu.",

They always fill the chips up and I have a huge party when I go there.    With the Mexican food restaurants out there, this one is the best one.  I love the food and the atmosphere they provide. I have always had a friendly waiter, the manager has come to talk to us and even help serve drinks.  They are always aware of when the chip bowl is empty.  I think the only two things that annoy me from there is their rice is not good and their green corn tamales are too smooshy. Other then that I love this place and until I can find a place that wows me with their mexican food, this is it.   If anyone orders a burger from here they really shouldn't be posting a review, wtf is up with that? It's a mexican restaurant not McDonalds.",

    "text": "where to begin? how about a capitol T for terrible. I have been going to Macayo's off and on over the years....  Last night I took a friend from out of town there for dinner.  I felt confident that the food and service would be pretty good.  Well, not so.  Besides the presentation of our meals being amateurish and unappealing the food was tired and dried up.  Laughing as I write these words but, it's the truth.  The waitress was sweet and tried to do her best but, we sat there for 1/2 hour before they took our order.  Then to the food. Honestly,  I had a beef tostada and the flavor was unrecognizable and the beans were like paste.  The bean tostada that my friend was attempting to eat was completely unacceptable.  Now, how hard is it to pull off something as simple as a Bean Tostada... really?  The waitress offered to get us more food, different food etc.  What we really should have recieved was a refund and an apology.",

I know its run of the mill,  but they have this dish nailed down.  I worked at the one on central when I was a young muchacha and their chimi is good too. But Im always disappointed with the one on warner bummer cause its closer to me",

    "text": "Love this Place.  Granted it's a chain restaurant so the menu is like a mexican Ihop (ihop a favorite comort stop too) but it's my neighborhood stop and the staff is great.  Love the food, and the Chips and Salsa.  And if you haven't had the frozen Margarita's then you gotta stop in and try them.  Upstairs is the Sports bar set up and outside it is set on one of the Dobson Ranch Lakes.  The Stand out appeal of this Macayo's is the Staff, the Lake, the upstairs set and the Margarita's.  Love this place and I'll always go back.",

    "text": "I am giving this place 1 extra star since I love the sauce that they sell at stores for enchiladas. So I decided to go here and give the real thing a try. Man was I surprised....they dont even use their own sauce they sell. The sauce that landed on my tongue was gross, I tried to start over in my head thinking maybe I was expecting to much but the meat inside was not any better. To top all this off the sewer was over flowing outside and was stinking up the night air. Even though my wife said she liked what she ate this is my review and I would never return. Learn from this review and use the sauce that you sell at Walmart and things will start to get better.",

It took a long time to get drinks and chips refilled.  We had no response to our complaints about the food.  Overall, you can get this kind of food anywhere, even the grocery store.",
