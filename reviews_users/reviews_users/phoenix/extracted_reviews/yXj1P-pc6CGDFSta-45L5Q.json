    "text": "Wow. What's happened to this First Watch?  We came in Sunday morning  at 11:00, and was put on a \"20 minute\" wait list. We counted 3 other groups( of 2 or 3) and 15 open tables( half of which appeared to have been cleaned).  When I inquired why the patrons were not  being seated, I was eventually told that 2 busboys called out. Yet, we watched waitresses/waiters standing around gazing at customers with no sense of urgency at all. It appeared no one wanted to clear & clean the tables. When a waiter QGgmyelled at the host to clean a table, the host angrily swiped food and paper onto the floor.   The irony was there were clean tables where customers could have been seated.  Perhaps those tables were not in the area of the idle waitresses, and thus, no concern to them.   Deplorable display of customer service, in any case. In my youth, I worked in restaurants. When shorthanded, we sucked it up and did whatever had to be done. Here, it appears no one is willing to go beyond their job description. Management should take notice.",

    "text": "I really like this restaurant and the food. However, this particular location seems to have a problem with staffing or seeing people seated. We keep going back and hoping for a change. This is the 4th time now that we have gone (party for 2) with a 30 min wait and empty tables all around. Today we counted 9 empty tables all cleaned off and ready for seating. The restaurant looked empty inside but the outside was filled with people standing around waiting. If it's a server problem I'm curious why Sundays are not staffed appropriately. Generally, it seems to be a hostess problem. For example, we asked to sit at the community table (empty) and was told they might end up using it. Finally, decided to leave and were told (different hostess) \"do you want to use our community table it's open now.\" If the experience had been once it wouldn't be worth a review. Unfortunately, it's repeatedly the same every Sunday we attempt to go.",

Even good and efficient service. The second time, after being seated, it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged by a server and the food wasn't quite as memorable. This morning, my third visit, was not good. That same, perfect temperature sandwich with the melted cheese was cold, cheese not melted and the ham seemed dry. My friend had the roast beef sandwich which was too greasy to eat and she sent it back. The servers seemed overworked and distracted and the manager seemed to be irritated with whatever was going on. The place was busy but I was disappointed.  I'm sad to say I'll miss that sandwich..",

I told the food runner who brought our breakfast out, but 7 minutes later nothing. Our waitress came to check on us and I told her about it. No apologies just oh okay and didn't ask if we needed anything else. I still ended up waiting another 5 minutes for the juice that a different person brought out. After that we didn't see our waitress. Someone else brought us the check. It's a shame because I love the avocado toast, but the service is disappointing.",

    "text": "A good place, but perhaps a little... confused.  We had never been to a First Watch before, so were excited to try this one out. Our hostess took great pains to tell us how this location was focusing on using fresh, local ingredients in everything. She then set down a pot of coffee for us and let us look over the menu.  We poured the coffee and realized the only creamer we could get wasn't fresh or local, but was little pre-packaged creamer cups on the table. Being a fan of local coffee roasters, when she came back I asked where the coffee beans came from and she said it was their own brand and packaged out of state. She made a point of telling me I could buy some when I left.  So the first two things the fresh and local focused place did was offer us fake creamer and out of state roasted beans. We were getting nervous.  Fortunately things picked up from there. I tried the avocado toast, which was fantastic. No skimping on the avocado here, and it was lightly seasoned to let the natural taste shine through. My wife had a skilled, which was also really well done and tasty.  They have a nice section of their menu focusing on healthy and lighter fair, which I'm looking forward to trying on future visits.  We could tell the staff was new, but they were trying hard and I'm sure they will work out the kinks shortly. The place is cute and decorated well, and their patio looks promising when it cools down a bit.  I was surprised when I was asked to name a tip amount at the register rather than being able to write it on the receipt like most places, but perhaps that is how all the First Watches do it.  So I think my concern came from the way they set expectations. If they hadn't been touting fresh and local so much I probably wouldn't have wondered about it. The coffee was good no matter where it came from, but I do think the creamer-cups were a bit cheesy.  We'll definitely be back, but we'll pay less attention to their branding and focus on finding more dishes we like as much as the ones we had today.",

    "text": "I'm not typically a fan of breakfast chain restaurants but First Watch is very close to where I live, and I've heard good things about their other locations so I decided to give it a try. I've been here twice so far and have learned that their menu varies from their other restaurants which makes it seem less corporate and more local. Each time I've visited the wait was around 5 -10 minutes, not too bad for a Saturday and Sunday. They offer a large array of breakfast and lunch options, and specials that are seasonal. I tried the avocado toast on my first visit and my husband had the chikichangas. On my second visit I had the veg'd out omelet and my husband had the turkey burger. We both enjoyed our food at each of our visits, my dishes were simple yet tasted delicious and fresh. It's nice to have a casual and reasonably priced option in the Biltmore area because there are very few around. They also have healthy options, so when my husband wants to indulge (which is most of the time) and I'm trying to stay disciplined this places offers something for both of us. First Watch stands out among the other breakfast chain restaurants, I will definitely be adding this into my rotation.",

As far as the food, the waffles, bacon, pancakes, Chicken Chimichurri Hash with 2 eggs basted (a hard request for many cooks) Lemon Ricotta Pancakes all were done exactly as the menu explained them and in a relatively fast delivery time. Victoria did everything like it was no effort....a real GEM BTW I am a restaurant consultant and easily find fault...congrats First Watch",

They offer traditional breakfasts and a few out of the ordinary options. They were featuring a melon drink that looked refreshing, but I needed my coffee. I had the avocado toast that comes with two basted eggs. The toast comes with heaping mounds of avocado with some olive oil and a nice sprinkle of salt. Soooo delicious and fresh.  My lunch partners had the traditional breakfast and the smoked salmon on toast. Both were very happy with their meals. Their portions are generous and priced right.  We realized we were running late part way through our meal and Frankie quickly brought our bill and a take home container.  We will return.",

    "text": "Update:  While I love the food, specifically the pancakes , you may want think twice about picking this location. Here's why:   I live down the street and frequent this FirstWatch nearly every other Saturday, still I've never once been recognized, acknowledged, or made to feel like a valued patron. The staff is genuinely unfriendly. They're not particularly rude, just not friendly or conversational at any level.   While surely one can understand they get busy, the service is lacking and appears to be without effort. They tend to forget about people until you're eating and don't want to be annoyed or it's time to pay. In addition the staff are generally inattentive and difficult to flag for assistance.   For instance, just this morning I was left with nothing to drink until my food came despite repeated attempts to try to get attention from multiple servers.   Finally, They rarely ask how things were or if you enjoyed your meal, with the exception of the moment  they bring you your food. Thus providing no opportunity for feedback or to rectify a bad experience.   Despite the poor service, I tip my hat to the chef and stand by my previous review. The banana granola pancakes are the best around, which is why I continue to return.  However, if you're not particularly fond of pancakes, in the immediate area, or looking for a regular breakfast spot, you may be wise to visit one of the many other FirstWatch locations or choose an establishment that appreciates its customers more and will leave you with a positive experience.   --------------------------------------------------- I am on a quest to find the best pancakes in the valley. So far FirstWatch wears the crown. If you're a flapjack connoisseur you must try their banana granola pancakes. It can be busy on the weekends, so try to beat the rush. However, a small communal seating area shortens the wait if you're with a small party.",

I don't usually care for toast; however this thick whole grain toast was so flavorful I ate it crust and all :-).  My first time there I had a burrata cheese toast and loved that as well; however I didn't see it on the menu the last two times (I believe it might be seasonal). The service has always been great, with friendly and personable staff. I highly recommend First Watch on Camelback.",

    "text": "A few friends and I came in to enjoy brunch this afternoon around 2:15 pm. The host/manager who greeted us seemed very agitated that we arrived nearing the end of the shift. We ordered promptly and were conscious that we were going to expedite our meal so the staff who didn't make us feel welcome could go home. Ethan was our server and he was very polite and courteous. Ethan made us feel comfortable given the circumstances. I had asked Ethan for another order at 2:30 after we placed our first order around 2:20. He was more than happy to accommodate.   My frustration is with the host or manager whom walked up and interrupted us and advised Ethan that the grill is turned off. He must be the manager because Ethan took his word and advised us that the grill is off and he can no longer accommodate our needs. Correct me if I'm wrong but A grill is not needed to cook a few eggs and potatoes.  A Range and skillet can be used for eggs and potatoes. Lastly, I'm sure the bacon is pre cooked or prepped prior to shift.  Coming from an Owner/GM of a restaurant myself, the host/manager was very unprofessional. This is the service industry. A successful restaurant is hinged on customer service, that which was lacking here at First Watch.   I am Not discounting the Cusine. I really enjoyed the Chickenchanga and the Carrot Cake hot cakes. Very delicious.   Unfortunately, I will not return. The lack of accommodation the unwelcoming host/manager and unprofessionalism that was displayed today is what frustrates me to no end. Especially when this is perceived by a general manager of a restaurant that prides itself on customer service.   I advise all patrons to visit Matt's Big breakfast. Conveniently located across camelback, in the Safeway strip mall. MBB always makes me feel welcome and is overly accommodating even if you arrive 20 minutes prior to close!  If you hold customer service to a high standard, visit Matt's Big breakfast and NOT First Watch.",

At only $3.99 it was a steal as compared to most juice shops.   I had the market hash. It was delicious! The potatoes were a little mushy which was a nice change from your standard hash. I really enjoyed the flavors. It came with the hash, two eggs, and one large piece of toast with jam and butter.   The tomato soup was delicious! Very creamy and fortunately vegetarian.   My coworkers all got the egg sandwich and were extremely happy with them. The bacon was huge!   Overall very happy with the service and food. Will be back!",

I ordered the eggs Benedict BLT and my bread was cold and hard. It was overall too salty and sour for my taste. As for the service, the hostess and majority of the staff was super nice! My only problem was with one waitress. There was a waiter that said we were his first official order (he's new and I guess it was his first day on the job as a waiter). He was nice and made great eye contact. As he was about to take our order and took out his pad to write our order, this other lady waitress came and took over. I'm pretty sure she was only suppose to supervise him. However, she took our order and did all the talking soon after. She moved quick, but she was rude. I ordered an ice tea and did not receive it. She brought the check out to us and I asked if the ice tea was on the check because I never received it. She said she'll bring it out to me, I said I didn't need it anymore since we were done eating and she quickly snapped the check and walked off. She came back, dropped off the new check, and said \"have a nice day\". Not once did she apologize for not getting me my ice tea or made eye contact with my mom and I. After a couple of minutes later, my mom and I spotted the new waiter with his back pack going home. Hopefully, he was going home because his shift was over, not because that crazy waitress lady sent him home. I think he would make an excellent waiter. The lady waitress was too much in a rush....it wasn't even rush hour.",

This is within walking distance of work and is competitively priced with a Safeway deli sandwich but the place is probably better for a sit down meal rather than take out.

Everyone else ordered omelette and pancakes as well and couldn't have been happier with their choices. However I felt the need to knock off 3 stars because our service was absolutely atrocious.   I'm not normally one to be too bothered by slow service (as I've worked in 3 different restaurants), however, this was some of the most inattentive and unpleasant service I've ever had eating out.  After taking our order our server did not return until after we were halfway done with our meal (our food was brought to us by runners). The worst part of this is that we had run out of water before our food even arrived. After she finally checked on us to ask us about our food and we asked her for water it still took another 5 minutes before we got refills (this whole time we saw her walking around the restaurant and standing in the back).   Overall I would recommend First Watch to others because I assume they will not receive the same service, however it was very disappointing for us.",

He bluntly said, do you need your check? Hes the one with slight red hair.  I like First Watch,  will definately ask for a better server and not all hostesses are cheerful.",

Everyone was supper nice from the hostess to the server to the district manager I think it was who going around refilling drinks and checking on people. I also had pancakes with real maple syrup it came in a tiny bottle so good",

So glad this place is literally a 5 minute drive, and serves brunch through 230pm! Perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon when your flight lands 3am in the morning and you stumble out of bed at 1230pm.   The egg hash was fantastic! Coffee is decent, nothing to write home about, but isn't over burnt like star*gag*bucks.",

    "text": "With my husband and son out of town, my daughter and I met a friend on Saturday for a girls' lunch... We decided to meet at this First Watch due to it's convenient location + the fact that at least one of us may be in gym clothes (ahem, that was me), and didn't want to deal with too much of a busy scene or a place that was all about seeing and being seen.  Upon entering, it was clear that there wouldn't be a much of a scene, as there were plenty of open tables.  That part was a relief, but we were a bit concerned to find several parties waiting and barely being acknowledged when half the restaurant was empty.  When we were finally acknowledged, the host / hostess were not the friendliest, approximating a 15-20 minute wait and forgetting to mention that we could have chosen to sit immediately at their \"community table.\"  We learned about that a few minutes later when another party walked in and sat right down.  Luckily, we didn't have to wait that long and we were seated at a comfy booth about 5-10 minutes later.  Service wasn't the best, as we had to wait awhile for our water / coffee / juice, but once we ordered, it all turned out fine.    One thing to know if you go here... Avocado Toast.  That is definitely the way to go.  It may be on a temporary summer menu, but my advice to FW is to keep that puppy on the menu forever.  If I come back, that is what I'll come back for!  I was also pleasantly surprised with the kids menu... my daughter had the eggs and bacon which comes with toast, fruit and a drink.    This location doesn't feel a ton like a chain, which I like.  The inside has a warm vibe, fun decor, clean bathrooms, etc... they also have a shaded patio, which a couple of brave patrons were sitting at despite the high temps in the 100s this weekend.  If they can get a strong manager in place and/or improve the service a bit, I'd consider adding this to my regular breakfast rotation for sure... especially if that avocado toast sticks around on the menu!",

Pancake was crumbly and didn't hold together very well and the eggs had a surprising amount of oil on them. I also ordered a carrot, Apple ginger juice which I dare say.. The ingredients came out of a container(pre made??) and Im wondering if there was any ginger in it at all.. In short, it didn't seem like much care was put into the preparation and I guess the servers could care less about what they're serving.   Although the greeting upon entry was very welcoming, everything else was at best meh..  I recommend somewhere else.. And read these reviews.. They help.  That's where I went wrong.",

She just said, \"Can I get you some water or coffee or something?\" We said water, she brought it to the table (all of this happening in, I'm not kidding, 45 seconds) and asked us if we were ready to order. Considering we had just sat down 45 seconds ago, we said we would need another minute.  She came back precisely one minute later. We were ready. We both wanted the Traditional breakfast - 2 eggs, a side of bacon or sausage, toast, and potatoes. However, we both asked if we could substitute the toast and potatoes for just additional meat, and we also said that an up-charge would be fine. She acted like this melted her brain. She told us that she couldn't substitute them but she could just get us extra sides of the meat. We said fine.  When she brought our food, my boyfriend's order did not include the extra side of bacon he ordered. She said, \"well when you don't want the toast or potatoes they put tomato slices on your plate instead. But I can go get you the side of bacon...\" ummm yes please?  When she brought it back she slammed it on our table and said nothing and walked away. When we got the check, not only had she not just done an up-charge for us not having potatoes and toast, but she charged us the full price for the meal as if we DID have those things ($9.49) PLUS full charge for the extra sides of meat ($3.49 each, and we got 1 each). So, if you're doing the math at home, that's approximately $13.00 for 2 eggs and 2 pieces of sausage before tax. Oh, and some tomato slices.  I still don't know her name, so I don't even know who to tell you to avoid, which is why I'm saying to avoid this place all together. The food was definitely not good enough to sit through this kind of service and pay a total of $40 for 2 people to eat breakfast.",

Rolled silverware is left across the table, in lieu of near guest. Booths not fully cleaned. Egg overcooked within grilled sourdough bread. Beau's eats were traditional eggs and bacon.  Multigrain toast and sourdough could both be improved with a local bakery.  Cashier walks away before we sign off on the check... there was a thank you there somewhere.",

I ended up walking out and going to a different location. Pretty bummed, I won't go to this location again",

The service is always friendly, fast, and attentive. The food is always good, I can honestly say I have never had a bad meal here. The worst part is trying to decide what I want to eat because there are so many good choices. I would recommend the morning meditation juice, the avocado toast, the bacado omelet, and the market hash. Make sure you don't skip over the seasonal menu either, there is always a great selection. Keep it up First Watch Biltmore :)",

    "text": "I could not wait to come home to write this review.  I will say I have not been to a First Watch in years, so when I saw how convenient this location was to us today I decided to check it out.  Now I understand that we were there about an hour before closing, but in no way should that have effected the rate in which the hostess could seat us and or ring us up when leaving.  She grabs our menus to seat us, then proceeds to stop and have a conversation with a waitress that was ending her shift. They felt this was a good time to talk about the hostess's road trip. After being seated we are greeted by a waiter that was not attentive. I don't need a social hour show, just some basic attention.  From only getting one serving of water to serving me the wrong meal. Trying to get his attention to fix the error, was a chore.  I ate my side salad that was warm because they served HOT chicken on it (gross) At this point I am not feeling like a winner by no means, and still a little hangry. The server brings me the right sandwich in a to go box.  The bread was heated.  Not toasted like you would expect on a club sandwich, but heated.  It was mushy looking and pretty much useless to take with us.  We go to pay for this wilted, hot and wrong meal and the same young girl that sat us must have stepped in some molasses because I have never seen a young seemingly healthy person walk so slow, she finally makes it to the register, doesn't ask how was it, how you doing, nothing, swipes our card, puts the receipt in front of us, tells us to sign it as she is walking away.  Really? again, I don't need to make a friend, but my gosh how about displaying a little bit of customer service.  In summary, their lunches are warm and soggy and the customer service was just soggy.",

Seen it driving by but never stopped by, and today, by luck my friend and I wanted to go to a place and they were super busy so I looked online and this place showed up and I'm glad it did. After waiting for about 6\"5 minutes to be seated (until a table was cleared for us outside) we got a very nice server (Tania I think was her name) who greeted us with a smile and a pot of coffee :-) we asked a few questions and my friend was really interested to get the \"morning meditation\" but was hesitant about the beet juice and turmeric mix, so I asked for a sample and Tania  was kind enough to get us a sample (with no beet juice for my friend) and one for me as well. This drink was amazing and I ended up getting one.   For brunch I ordered their power breakfast quinoa bowl with an extra egg. The dish was absolutely delicious, quinoa, Italian sausage, kale criminology mushrooms and tomatoes. The right portion of everything. Filling and tasty, and I loved it.   A place where you can find great service as Tania was super nice and sweet, amazing food and tasteful arrangements, and the location was superb. Definitely coming back here.",

Our service was solid, the waitress brought us a thermos of coffee which was unexpected but totally awesome.  I ordered the breakfast tacos and the lady the chocolate chip pancake.  Although I sort of wonder if they're using quail eggs because the two eggs she received with her gigantic pancake were small.  What gets First Watch to the fourth star is our waitress, she was grinding the whole time.  I would have to say the food, although delicious was only three star worthy.  She had the chocolate chip pancake, right?  Well, to her chagrin, although she loves blueberries, there were blueberries in the pancake.  How do you do that.  So really.  You had a shot for four, but struck out with a 3-3 count.",

I have visited the other location on Thomas and it was definitely forgettable and service was not great. We came to this location and there was a 20 minute wait on a Sunday morning but you look around the restaurant and there were at least 4 or 5 empty tables. They were definitely understaffed, which also impacts the service. When we finally got seated, it took 10 or so minutes to get water.   Since the waiter took 10 minutes, it gave us the time to look at the menu so when he dropped the water off, we told him we were ready to order. I ordered the avocado toast (recommended by Gabi M.) with overhard eggs. Hubby ordered a blueberry and carrot cake multigrain pancake.   The avocado toast was everything I expected it to be - delicious!!! Good job, First Watch, for keeping it on your menu. The pancakes weren't bad either. I actually liked the carrot cake better than the blueberry one, but Hubby liked the blueberry one better.   Our server wasn't really around for the rest of the dining experience after food was dropped off. He did drop our check and told us to pay up front, but that was it.   Our bill was rather inexpensive so I was delighted about that. Overall, service and efficiency needs to improve but the food and value are pretty good.",

Ive been saying for awhile that Phoenix is really starting to grow as a foodie Mecca and this only helps solidify its position. Best breakfast/lunch spot in Phoenix!!!!",

    "text": "First Watch is a successful chain restaurant that specializes in breakfast and brunch. Having been to First Watch restaurants in the Midwest, I thought I would try the new restaurant off Camelback road in the Biltmore/Arcadia district. First off the decor is very pleasing and upscale compared to traditional FW restaurants which historically appear more country casual (nicer than but similar in color genes as the IHOP). This FW maybe the nicest I have seen. Expecting the solid but straight forward food of old, FW has picked up its game. The steel cut oatmeal was well presented with fruits and even herbs added. It came with a nice muffin. The pancake was perfectly made and tasty but was not unique (I prefer the untraditional thicker ones with the fruits cooked inside. No complaints with his pancake though. The juices have expanded from ordinary bottled OJ to option of Kale or carrot/ginger infused drinks. I had the latter which was as good as a juice bar. Service was friendly and abundant though my polite server was maybe the least of the attentive of those that I saw. While the inside is nice, I would have liked outside seating option that is lightly covered. There's was encased in concrete with openings. Makes it somewhat dark. In conclusion definitely worth going. It is not a risky proposition and the price is chain right. Good game pickup FW.",

My boyfriend and I ordered a few things just to see if what we had ordered last time happened to be a \"bad day\".   First of all when I walked in I noticed a bad smell that threw me off but I ignored it. We ordered a whole wheat banana pancake, \"chorizo\" omelette and a \"Italian sausages omelette. I was so disappointed in both. My omelette tasted like a pizza, it felt like my sausage was those unfrozen kind that goes on top of pizza. The chorizo omelette did not taste like chorizo at all... I ordered a side of salad with \"lemon vinaigrette\" &  unfortunately it didn't taste like it had any dressing on it. I think what saddened me even more was that we waited almost 40 min for our food. We were trying to be understanding until...we saw that 3 other tables that were sat AFTER us, not only received their food but were almost done eating...while we were still waiting for our food. I will say though that the pancakes were good!   SERVICE, was amazing. Our server was a sweet heart and even brought us samples of their tonics/juices! That's why I really wanted to like this place, because our server was a great guy. Giving the 2 stars only because we had an amazing server!   Overall I can say that I don't see myself ever coming back here but if you're the type to want to pay about $34 for a breakfast that was, let's just say not the best, then go for it.",

The restaurant was not crowded and the hostess gave us the option of waiting or being sat. We chose to be sat. Our waiter, James, came immediately to take our orders. We explained we were waiting for someone else, but I ordered coffee and hubby ordered orange juice. As usual, our son was running late and actually didn't get there until closer to 10 a.m. He also brought our grandson, so we had to request a child's menu. James was extremely attentive and took drink orders when son and grandson arrived as well as all of our food orders when ready. The food came out delicious. Hubby had one of the omelettes, I can't remember the name now, but it was tasty. Son had one of the power (?protein) bowls which also looked delicious. I did my usual 2 eggs with bacon that came with potatoes and toast. Our grandson got the children's waffle and bacon. He wanted another waffle, which James quickly ordered and got out to him. Very pleasant experience. Very attentive service.",

I visit 3 different locations (Camelback, Thunderbird, Promenade) and the food is consistently delicious at each one.  My go-to is the avocado toast - it's on a thick bread and has EVOO and lemon squeezed on top... drool. They have great pancakes, oatmeal, and I've heard good things about all of their \"eggs-clusive\" items as well. Don't miss the Kale Tonic green juice! For lunch I almost always get the veggie sandwich which I highly recommend.   Overall service is pretty fast, I like how they can turn people in and out quickly. Even if there is a wait it doesn't feel like forever. This place is definitely popular for a reason! :)",

The line we encountered when we first walked in seemed a little daunting, but the hostess assured us that the wait would be less than 20 minutes. We wandered outside to wait for our table and we stumbled upon a small seating area outside in the shade. There was a fountain and flowers--it was the prefect place to wait.  As soon as we were called back in, our bubbly, personable waitress greeted us and took our drink orders. I would highly recommend the iced tea, as it wasn't sweet but it had a bold taste.   Next, week ordered our food. It came out within minutes, and it was oh so delicious! All three of us ordered the Elote Mexican Street Corn Hash off of the summer special menu (without chorizo). It was delicious! The corn was roasted to perfection and the creamy Cotija cheese was a great complement. The potatoes and and scallions in the base layer of the dish provided a savory aspect, while also making the dish significantly more filling.  To summarize, if you're looking for a decently-priced, delicious brunch with impeccable service in Phoenix, then this is the place for you!",

They let us try items off their new fall menu, and we got to give donations in lieu of the check. It was so cool and a very fun experience! :)   The fall menu was really yummy. It started with a Carrot Ginger Chai that I really liked. I didn't think I would because I'm not huge on ginger or carrot juices, but it was really sweet and had cinnamon flavors, too. I thought it was a very unique and interesting start for the breakfast items.   Next we got to share an order of the Farmer's Biscuit Sandwich, Pumpkin Pie Oatmeal and Pumpkin Pancake Breakfast. The Pumpkin Pancake was definitely my favorite - I'll be coming back for that in the fall for sure! It came with warm maple syrup, chicken sausage and eggs. The pancake had a really tasty flavor that had just the right amount of pumpkin.   The Pumpkin Pie Oatmeal wasn't for me, but I don't care for oatmeal in general lol. It's cool how they put cranberries and pepitas on top! It came with an orange-cranberry muffin that was good, though.   The Farmer's Biscuit Sandwich was really tasty as well! I liked the arugula on it, and I really loved that they used mayo. On the side were breakfast potatoes and those were amazing :)   I'm really happy I got to try the sneak-peak of this menu as part of such a unique event and good cause, but I think I will for sure come back again to try more of their menu items!",

    "text": "I've usually had good luck with First Watch but today was a busy. They had some corporate guy talking super loud to his managers about why there have created an atmosphere for their staff to be sub par and not going out of their way. The hostess sat us right next to the kitchen even though there were only two other customers.   Asked for crispy and received straight up burnt. Told the waitress about it when she came back... of course she didn't come back until after we were done with eating the edible pieces.   Having already waited over a half hour for only our order to be cooked and with no other orders around... i wasn't going to wait for them to cook the food properly.   Hoping this isn't their best behavior seeming corporate is in town seeming it was really poor service and worse food.",

The granola is not and they have wheat corn tortillas for the Mexican inspired dishes. Apparently, they once had corn tortillas but opted to get rid of them.   With the many people who are trying to eat gluten free, you would think a major chain like this one would be on board. Hope they make some changes for the future.",

    "text": "My first visit to a first watch turned out to be one of the worst breakfast experiences I've ever had. My wife and i are from Tucson and stayed the previous night in Scottsdale for an event. On our way out of town, i decided to try first watch for the first time.   We arrived around 915am on the morning of August 27th. The restaurant was about half full, not too busy. We were greeted and sat promptly. Our server had another table who was seated right next to us. She took the table's order next to us, then proceeded to take ours. My wife ordered an omelet and i ordered a skillet with an extra egg on top.   About 10 minutes later, the table next to us got their food. I'm not sure of the exact time, but we probably waited another 10 to 15 minutes for our food, despite the fact we ordered at the same time as the table next to us.   Finally our food came, with no other visit from our server before then. Not even to assure us the food would be coming soon, despite the wait. The wife's omelet was fine, but my eggs on my skillet were extremely overcooked. I ordered them over medium, and they came out over hard. None of the yolks were runny at all. I pushed my plate aside, waiting for our server to return so i could tell her what was wrong. Almost 10 minutes passed before she came back and I could tell her that my eggs were overcooked. She apologized, and took my plate to be remade.   10, maybe 15 more minutes passed and still my second plate hadn't arrived. By now, my wife had finished her plate, and i hadn't even eaten. Once again, no return visit from the server with assurance or apology.   The second plate comes, and the server walks away. My fork was taken with the first plate, and i was not given a new one. Sitting for a few minutes, my wife finally got up and walked over to another vacant table to grab me a new set of silverware. I cut into the new eggs and they were extremely undercooked this time. The whites were almost completely runny.   By this time, we had been at the restaurant for almost an hour and i still had not eaten. To make things worse, our server never refilled our water, which remained empty for about 20 minutes. I told the server about the new eggs being undercooked and she took the plate away. We were already behind schedule to get back to Tucson, so i opted to take the check and cut my losses. The server delivered the check and said that my meal was comped.   Frustrated at our whole experience, we walked to the front to pay. When asked how our meal was, we explained what happened. We were told that when my first plate got sent back, the server had to ask what over medium cooked eggs were. I'm sorry, but If you work in a predominantly breakfast restaurant, you should what it means when someone orders eggs over medium. The cashier at the front told us our entire meal would be taken care of because of what happened.   My biggest problem with what happened, was the lack of communication and manager presence. The whole time we were there, i never once saw anyone who i thought was a manager. During our whole \"meal,\" i think our server visited our table 3 or 4 times. Never once did a manager come over and talk to us. As someone who has managed many restaurants and worked in the industry for 20 years, communication can go a long way when something goes wrong. If they were to have just talked to me, it would have made things way better. I get that mistakes happen, but when responsibility isn't taken, it makes me, the paying customer, feel like i don't matter.",

I went in for a water and to relax for a min but what I ended up with was a delicious \"Biscuits and Gravy side order\" which in my opinion looked like a full order. But I won't say anything. The food was great 5/5 for the food. I was helped and served by a lovely young woman, her name was Kameron. Miss Kameron was helpful in every way, her patience with my table was generous and timely. I feel like she's done this before. If you go in ask for Miss Kameron, you won't regret this spot. A great location, a little nook in the corner.  Definitely will come again.",

    "text": "I absolutely LOVE First Watch -- the food is tasty, the atmosphere is wonderful, and the staff is always super pleasant.   Hubby and I stopped into the Biltmore location on a Saturday morning after a chiropractor appointment to grab a bite to eat. We were expecting a long wait but to our surprise, we got seated rather quickly after arriving. Our server started us off with coffee and was extremely sweet, pleasant and knowledgeable on the menu.   I couldn't decide whether I wanted the Chickichanga or the Farmhouse Hash -- our server suggested the Farmhouse; done! Hubby ordered the Traditional Breakfast with scrambled eggs, chicken sausage, and their delicious potatoes. It wasn't long before we received our deliciously-looking and smelling food, hot from the kitchen to our table. Absolute yumminess!!! (Hubby even took a bite before I snapped a pic to post, hehe).  The Farmhouse Hash was extremely delicious and flavorful, made with fresh ingredients (you can truly taste the freshness). The only thing I would've changed with it was to take out the sun-dried tomatoes; I wasn't feeling them, and I felt like they were in abundance. But no biggie, I just ate around them. Hubby's traditional was delicious; just as we had expected.   Since it was closer to brunch than breakfast, I also wanted something for dessert to satisfy my sweet-tooth so we ordered some Lemon Ricotta pancakes.  Oh.Em.Gee! If you haven't tried these pancakes, you absolutely HAVE to! The lemon ricotta flavor topped with fresh strawberries and creamy lemon curd is seriously a mouth-watering combination. So yum! Not to mention the pancakes themselves were light and fluffy. Hubby was happy with my decision, and so was baby.   First Watch never disappoints and this location was no exception. Thanks for a great start to our day!",

Dining Companion always gets the TriAthlete and I try all the other items. Lemon Ricotta pancakes are great, was really surprised at how good the breakfast sandwich was (it sounded small but was filling), they have chickichangas (a Mexican crepe like thing) lunches they have 1/2 and 1/2 combos. It wasn't busy today, no wait, and the food came out fast. Don't know why the service was bad - it was just lacking.  After thinking more about this overnight, I adjusted the rating downward to a 3. They have NEVER made me a runny poached egg, and today's hash had two solid yolks in the basted eggs. My dining partner couldn't eat the fruit (hard, not ripe), and the eggs were cold. He likes the toast and the jam. Not enough for a great rating. The greens always need more acidity - usually just a light oil taste. Good sandwiches though.",

I always tell myself \"try something different for once\", but I always end up with a plate of scrambled eggs, bacon, and a multigrain pancake (had the blueberry today). Simple yet so satisfying.  Their seasonal menu always looks delicious, I've personally never had any issues with quality of the food or any servers. The prices are average, but it also isn't fair to compare cost and quality to other joints nearby since they're all different. I can't attest to the wait on the weekends, but when I stop in before work during the week, there is absolutely no wait at all.  The only thing that I would care to mention is that the iced coffee only comes pre sweetened and with creamer. Can't get it black. It's good, but definitely something to note.  Love this place, definitely need to get out of my box and try something different next time.",

My mother in law found a hair in her side of sausage, and our waitress (Ashleigh) had little to no facial expression or affect. Maybe there were other precipitating factors.

Sunday morning at 9:30 am the place was busy but there are a lot of tables so we didn't have to wait to get seated. There we several other families along with couples.  I ordered chorizo omelet and my wife ordered the works omelet with a side of blueberry pancakes to share with her mom.  Pancakes are huge so usually one is enough. Omelets came with a mixed green salad which we thought was odd but I guess it's healthy. Food was good tasting. Service was good. Family friendly place.",

I was there earlier today for brunch and I literally overheard who I presumed to be the manager poking fun at one of their OWN staff members who, I presume was hard-of-hearing because she was wearing a hearing aid. I overheard him say \"hey, can you hear me!?\", and the other servers joined in to  laugh at her. They LAUGHED. I was so disgusted that I almost spit my food out so I could just pay my bill and leave. I have friends who are deaf and there's nothing amusing about the challenges they face. I think it's widely agreed that there is enough ignorance and petty bigotry floating about in this world as it is, I'd really prefer NOT to have to deal with it while I eat.

    "text": "My party of four decided to grab a quick lunch and since First Watch was close by, we elected to pay it a visit. Our server was friendly, if relaxed....the place wasn't busy, so the relaxed service wasn't a problem. The husband and I both ordered the half sandwich/soup or salad combo (veggie sandwich for both of us, butternut squash soup for him, tomato basil soup for me). Both were good, the sandwich especially so. Price for the combo was just under $8. My first minor complaint was that the bowl of soup was pretty small, more like a cup, and the sandwich half was moderate in size. Perhaps I was hungry? My second minor complaint/observation was that our server initially gave us the incorrect bill. Not a big deal in the long run, but small details do contribute to the overall experience....and overall, I'd come here again and give First Watch a second chance. After all, that sandwich half was pretty darn good.",

Party of five (used to good dining) came for breakfast, seated right away.  We were assured by John, the waiter, it would get a lot busier and by the time we left, they were right!  We ordered the avocado toast as an appetizer even though it comes as a meal in itself.  It was the best I have ever tasted.  I ordered eggs Benedict with the salmon instead of ham - it came on ciabatta which had the perfect crunch to it.  Frittata salmon was good, as well as one of the skillets, the Healthy Turkey (an omelette), and the Elevated Egg Sandwich.   Salad came with most of the meals except the Skillet and while surprising, they were lovely to have in The morning.

    "text": "3/15/2017  Yelp Review First Watch  Phoenix AZ 3215 E Camelback Rd, Phx AZ, 85018. ~0.7mi  (602)955-3447     Everyone likes to get up on Sunday mornings or any morning to cook or go out for a nice breakfast, after all it is the most important meal of the day. I have high expectations for breakfast, it should be light and enjoyable. The environment where you eat should be relaxing and delightful. First Watch instantly comes up in my head when I think of this place, a place that is delicious and hearty. To start with their coffee is always brewed freshly and their jam taste like fresh fruit. First Watch exceeded my expectations right off the bat from eating their food to how we were treated by the workers.        It started on a Sunday morning, my family and I normally like to get breakfast after a nice church service so we decided to try a place that had recently just opened down the street from our house which was First Watch, we didn't really know what to expect but the reviews were  exceptional. When we walked in there was a big crowd, but no matter how many people came in the host made sure to greet everyone with a smile on their face. I get very impatient, especially in the mornings but the wait was only about ten minutes and they provided coffee and water while waiting. When we got seated the waiter was also very pleasant. She served us water and told us to take our time on what we wanted. I never like the waiters that make you feel like you have to rush to pick what you want to eat.        First Watch not only had friendly and welcoming workers but the physical atmosphere of the place felt very warm and comfortable. The place wasn't big but it also wasn't so small that it was uncomfortable and cluttered. They had these chairs that I sunk into, I didn't want to get up from my seat, the color of the chairs and the tables fit the napkins very well. Everything about this place was great, especially the price. There's so many places that are good but unfairly overcharge you for food. There was three of us that day. I ordered the breakfast sampler which came with meat that had a lot of flavor and it also came with eggs and a waffle or pancakes. My mom and my sister each ordered different things. First Watch provides food that anyone can eat, starting from vegan to meat lover's food. It can be healthy or it can be sweet depending on what you're feeling like. The bill at the end came out to be under 40 dollars, which is great for three people and for the amount of food that we got. This place has great quality food with reasonable pricing.        Our waiter was very kind and very patient, after all we weren't the fastest people to pick what we wanted to eat. She always came to the table but not so much that we got annoyed by it. If you want great food that comes with great service, this place is recommended. Therefore I give First Watch 5 out 5 stars. The food was tasted great and not having to wait a long time was a plus!",

    "text": "First Watch on Camelback is pretty damn tasty. Great place to bring your well behaved pet as they can seat you on the covered patio. They offer complimentary coffee should you come and be asked to wait. I had a mother daughter breakfast last Sunday and the waffles are very fluffy and really warm your spirit. I ordered the biscuits with turkey sausage gravy. It was packed with flavor in every bite. My favorite part of my meal was the hash. I love a rustic flare on a potato hash brown. Big chunks of crispy potato, yum. The service was pretty good considering how busy it was. Everyone is giving the host or front house manager a bad review, and I honestly feel that many of you misunderstand his demeanor. The man is busy. He probably has to deal with asshole's all day who complain about a 10 minute wait or not getting a table at the window. He is there to take your name and seat you when your table is ready. Just get over the attitude and enjoy your meal! I took home the French toast for my fiance and he loved it! Big thick pieces of French toast covered in fresh fruit and powdered sugar, yes please! The only thing I wish they would change (and granted this might just be a pet peeve of mine) when I asked for sugar free syrup, they brought me the actual bottle of smuckers sugar free syrup (as if I purchased it at the store and snuck it in my purse). I just would have preferred it in a serving dish or something....anyways, can't wait to go back! Not the cheapest, but the quality is far better than any other breakfast/brunch place around.",

What was strange was that there were plenty of empty seats both inside and outside. It really looked like they didn't have enough bussers to clear the tables to get people seated faster.  Once seated, they have coffee cups already setup at the tables. Our cups both had stuck coffee stains on the bottom and we had to ask for clean ones. These were clean - just old and stained. Service was prompt and friendly. Food was just mediocre for the price. I had the avocado toast which was good but had obviously been made before everyone else as the bottom was soggy. Also the two poached eggs that came with it were cold - nasty.  Ate the toast but sent back the eggs for hot ones.  For $10, I want crispy toast and hot eggs.  The Green Juice was tasty. Son said the biscuits and gravy were good but the potatoes that came with it were bad. They must have been bad if a teenage boy won't eat them.  All in all, disappointing.  Too many better choices in the hood these days to tolerate expensive mediocre breakfasts.",

    "text": "Nice, clean atmo.  Decent service.  Mixed feelings about the food itself.  This is supposed to be \"healthy\" sort of food, but for a breakfast joint I'd hope for better options for the coffee.  The familiar pink packets are on the table (can anyone say \"C\" word?) and there are mass produced artificially flavored creamer pop-tubs of creamer, like \"French Vanilla\", but nothing really \"natural\" is provided like stevia (or even \"Truvia\") or just plain old real cream that hasn't been cooked and packaged.  How about give the option to pay a little more for healthy sweetener or even real cream or soy/rice milk?  My benedict florentine was like a salad with a runny egg on it and some unusual, thin lemony salad dressing.  How about put \"Benedict\" in quotes (like I just did) if you're going to smother the thing in lemony salad dressing instead of real Hollandaise and not tell me?  I don't eat meat but my guess is that the usual nitrites are still there in the ham and bacon despite the knowledge that the \"C\" word is also associated with these.  Again, how about giving an option to pay a few dollars more so my family members, who want to opt-in on the meat, can not be fooled by brown bread thinking they are in a \"C\" free zone here with the food and drink.  Ahhh... just my two cents for those looking for authentic \"health\" food and not just some extra green and brown on their plates.  Time to take it further First Watch and really cater to the health food enthusiasts and up your game.",

Plus, the sizing was back to what it was previously so the portioning was perfect and the person who took our order over the phone was pleasant and helpful.

I ordered the BLTE, which is supposed to be a Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato sandwich with a fried egg added.  I would think that on a sandwich like this, the Bacon would be the star, but alas this was not to be.  What little bacon that was on the sandwich, maybe a slice and a half, was burnt black and crisp, it kinda looked like they dredged it up from the bottom of somewhere just so they could get back to closing down the line (45 minutes early).  The rest of the sandwich was great - the egg was fried perfectly, cheese was all melted and apart from the disappointing bacon, not a bad sandwich.  I\"m sorry I bothered them so late in the day.  I learned my lesson.  I'll be back, but only for breakfast.  Addendum:  Hi Eleni, thank you for your reply.  I'd just like to let you know that I most certainly know the difference between smoked (dark) meat, and greasy, bottom of the bin leftover bacon.  I\"m sorry I neglected to take any photos, that would have shown everybody what it looked like.  OTOH, maybe that is a good thing for you.  I've been a customer of First Watch on and off for over twenty years, at different locations, of course, but I will say this is the first time I came for lunch.",
